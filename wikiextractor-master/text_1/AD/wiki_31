{"id": "2224433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224433", "title": "Interface Builder", "text": "Interface Builder\n\nInterface Builder is a software development application for Apple's macOS operating system. It is part of Xcode (formerly Project Builder), the Apple Developer developer's toolset. Interface Builder allows Cocoa and Carbon developers to create interfaces for applications using a graphical user interface. The resulting interface is stored as a .nib file, short for \"NeXT Interface Builder,\" or more recently, as an XML-based .xib file.\n\nInterface Builder is descended from the NeXTSTEP development software of the same name. A version of Interface Builder is also used in the development of OpenStep software, and a very similar tool called Gorm exists for GNUstep. On March 27, 2008, a specialized iPhone version of Interface Builder allowing interface construction for iPhone applications was released with the iPhone SDK Beta 2. \n\nInterface Builder was intentionally developed as a separate application, to allow interaction designers to design interfaces without having to use a code-oriented IDE, but as of Xcode 4, Apple has integrated its functionality directly into Xcode.\n\nInterface Builder first made its appearance in 1986 written in Lisp (for the ExperLisp product by ExperTelligence). It was invented and developed by Jean-Marie Hullot using the object-oriented features in ExperLisp, and deeply integrated with the Macintosh toolbox. Denison Bollay took Jean-Marie Hullot to NeXT later that year to demonstrate it to Steve Jobs. Jobs immediately recognized its value, and started incorporating it into NeXTSTEP, and by 1988 it was part of NeXTSTEP 0.8. It was the first commercial application that allowed interface objects, such as buttons, menus, and windows, to be placed in an interface using a mouse. One notable early use of Interface Builder was the development of the first WorldWideWeb web browser by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, made using a NeXT workstation.\n\nInterface Builder provides \"palettes\", or collections, of user interface objects to an Objective-C or Swift developer. These user interface objects contain items like text fields, data tables, sliders, and pop-up menus. Interface Builder's palettes are completely extensible, meaning any developer can develop new objects and add palettes to Interface Builder.\n\nTo build an interface, a developer simply drags interface objects from the palette onto a window or menu. \"Actions\" (messages) which the objects can emit are connected to \"targets\" in the application's code and \"outlets\" (pointers) declared in the application's code are connected to specific objects. In this way all initialization is done before runtime, both improving performance and streamlining the development process. When Interface Builder was a standalone application, interface designers could ship nib files to developers, who would then drop them into their projects.\n\nInterface Builder saves an application's interface as a bundle that contains the interface objects and relationships used in the application. These objects are archived (a process also known as serialization or marshalling in other contexts) into either an XML file or a NeXT-style property list file with a .nib extension. Upon running an application, the proper NIB objects are unarchived, connected into the binary of their owning application, and awakened. Unlike almost all other GUI designer systems which generate code to construct the UI (notable exceptions being Glade, Embarcadero Technologies's Delphi and C++Builder, which stream UI objects similarly), NIBs are often referred to as \"freeze dried\" because they contain the archived objects themselves, ready to run. As of Interface Builder version 3, a new file format (with extension .xib) has been added, which is functionally identical to .nib, except it is stored in a flat file, making it more suitable for storage in revision control systems and processing by tools such as diff.\n\n"}

They have shelf-lives of about 3 years, and their contents are designed to be acceptable to a variety of religious and ethnic groups. The meals cost approximately one-fifth of the cost of a Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE). The rations were first used in Bosnia in 1993.\n\nFrom the time they were created and used in 1993 until November 2001, HDRs were packaged with a bright yellow outer plastic covering; this choice of color, however, proved to be problematic in areas of the world where cluster bombs were being used, as the bombs were the exact same shade of yellow and recipients of the rations sometimes confused the ration package for undetonated cluster bombs, often spotting the bright color from a distance and making an incorrect assumption; this prompted the United States Federal Government to reissue the packages with a deep salmon pink outer covering to distinguish them from the bombs (this color has been used in the HDR manufacturing process ever since).\n\nThe meals are designed to be able to survive being air-dropped without a parachute.\nThis is safer for refugees than parachuting large pallets of rations, as well as preventing meal hoarding by those able to seize a single, large delivery.\n\nHDRs are also made available through organizations such as The Salvation Army to aid victims of poverty in the United States, and were distributed during Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita to victims of the disasters by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n\nThe HDR packages are delivered in cases of packages, each containing a small selection of food items based on predetermined menus and an accessory pack containing red pepper, pepper, salt, sugar, spoon, matches, an alcohol-free moist towelette, and a napkin.\n\nHDRs are typically air-dropped into the disaster area on large pallets. The HDRs initially dropped in Afghanistan were yellow before it was realized that the packages were the same color as the bomblets in American cluster bombs, which were also dropped in Afghanistan. Later packages were covered in salmon colored foil.\n\nHDRs produced by the United States are manufactured by the same companies that produce MREs designed for the United States Armed Forces. Like MREs, the food components are designed so they can be consumed without requiring additional preparation, including cooking. They do not, however, include flameless ration heaters, which are found in MREs.\n\n\nOn October 15, 2001, the United States announced a humanitarian daily ration for Afghanistan.\n\nOn October 24, 2001, Rear Admiral John Stufflebeem announced fears that the Taliban planned to poison American food aid.\nStufflebeem said that since the program had been started on October 7, 2001 the United States had dropped 785,000 rations.\n\n"}

{"id": "2224452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224452", "title": "Tompkins Table", "text": "Tompkins Table\n\nThe Tompkins Table is an annual ranking that lists the Colleges of the University of Cambridge in order of their undergraduate students' performances in that year's examinations. Two colleges - Darwin and Clare Hall - do not have undergraduate students and therefore do not feature in the list. It was created in 1981 by Peter Tompkins, then a third-year undergraduate mathematics student at Trinity College, who until 2015 compiled it every year exclusively for the newspaper \"The Independent\". Since 2016, it has been published by Varsity, a student newspaper of the University of Cambridge. It is not an official University of Cambridge table. It does not take account of students who are not candidates for Honours degrees, or those who have failed to gain a degree.\n\nInitially, it only included final year exams but since 1997 has covered all exams for which grades are allocated. The table allocates 5 points for a First Class degree, 3 points for an Upper Second (known also as a 2.i), 2 points for a Lower Second (a 2.ii), 1 point for a Third and no points for someone only granted an allowance towards an Ordinary Degree. The scores in each subject are then weighted to a common average, to avoid the bias towards colleges with higher proportions of students entered for subjects which receive higher average grades. The result is expressed as a percentage of the total number of points available. The differences between the highest places on the table are usually very slight. Christ's College was the top college in 2018 and 2019 following seven years in which Trinity College came top. The rankings are not officially endorsed by the University. Since Darwin College and Clare Hall admit only graduate students, they do not feature in this undergraduate ranking. Some of the mature colleges, including St. Edmund's College, Hughes Hall, Lucy Cavendish College, and Wolfson College, tend to perform relatively more poorly in the Tompkins Table, but have significantly more graduate students than undergraduate students, so the results here are not representative of the majority of the student population of each of these colleges.\n\nMost of the colleges fall within a 10% range of one another therefore the table should be taken lightly with regards to determining the academic standing of the colleges.\n\nBelow is the table for 2019:\n\nCertain Colleges of the University of Cambridge commission similar tables called Baxter Tables from Martin Baxter who is a financial analyst specialising in mathematical modelling and who developed the Electoral Calculus web site. Baxter tables rank colleges' undergraduate students by their year and subject separately and are delivered in July or August. They are compiled using published Class Lists, which do not include students who are not candidates for Honours degrees, or those who have failed to gain a degree, or those whose names the Council have determined should be withheld from public display. They are meant for internal use of Colleges but not the University, being distributed to the Senior Tutors of the Colleges , with the full tables not being published publicly or outside of the Colleges, and some students being unaware of their existence. However, the rankings of Colleges in the Baxter Tables are sometimes referred to by Colleges in publicly available literature, and the methodology used to compile the Baxter Tables is also available. There is also a 'value-added' table, which shows how students' results improve over the course of their years at Cambridge, and is intended to give a measure or indication of the quality of teaching at the different Colleges. However, with such small sample sizes, the amount of meaningful information which can be extracted from these tables is questionable.\n\nThe corresponding ranking for Oxford colleges is the Norrington Table. Since 1986, when the University of Oxford adopted split second-class degrees, the Norrington Table has adopted the same method of scoring as the Tompkins Table, but without the weighting attached to individual subject scores.\n\n\n"}

Bancks left school at the age of 14 and found employment with a finance company. His first illustrations were accepted and published by \"The Comic Australian\" in 1913, followed by \"The Arrow\" in 1914. This encouraged Bancks to submit work to \"The Bulletin\", where he was offered a permanent position, which he accepted and remained until 1922. Throughout this period he was studying art under Dattilo Rubbo and Julian Ashton and supplying freelance cartoons to the \"Sunday Sun\".\n\nHe created \"Ginger\" (later \"Ginger Meggs\") for the \"Sunday Sun\" and \"Sun News-Pictorial\". Bancks created \"The Blimps\" for the \"Melbourne Sun\" in 1923, and this daily strip ran until 1925, the year when he launched \"Mr. Melbourne Day by Day\" for the \"Melbourne Sun-Pictorial\".\n\nOn 15 October 1931 Bancks married Jessie Nita Tait (daughter of theatrical entrepreneur, Edward Joseph 'E.J.'

It is also done to keep the store appearing neat and organized.\n\nThe workers who perform this task normally have jobs doing other things in the store such as customer service, stocking shelves, daytime cleaning, bagging and carry outs (in grocery stores), etc. In some stores, however, facing is done only by the stockers. Facing is generally done near closing time when there are fewer customers and also while the store is completely closed. In busier stores it may be done constantly.\n\nIn department stores it may be referred to as recovery, as in the store is recovering from the rush of customers that affect the model appearance the store wants to portray. Merchandise may be put in the wrong area, or customers may leave debris on the floor. Correcting these issues is a part of the recovery process.\n\nFacings also refer to the amount of shelf space a particular product is given. A lot of facing generally increases sales of a particular product, therefore manufacturers often pay more money to get more facings for their products. This can lead to situations in which the largest manufacturers end up with the most shelf space because they have the greatest ability to pay.\n\nFacing tends to have the benefit of making products more accessible to customers, especially in situations in which it can be difficult to see what products are on the top and bottom shelves. Additionally, it is speculated that neater and fuller looking shelves have desirable psychological effects on customers for businesses. It is thought that if a customer sees disorganized shelves, they will get the impression that the store is poorly run or understaffed, and consequentially will be disinclined to shop there again. It is also thought that shoplifters will tend to be emboldened if they see disorganized shelves, because they may perceive the disorganization as a sign of a lack of employee supervision over the store. \n\nAlthough facing is a common practice in retail, it's unclear as to exactly how much value it adds to a business, or whether it is worth the cost of labor needed to do it although facing is generally done at less busy times when staff would otherwise have not much else to do. Proper studies are lacking to quantify the value of facing. Another issue that many businesses have to grapple with regarding facing is the highly ephemeral nature of properly faced shelves. A perfectly faced cereal aisle in a grocery store for example will be returned to its former state of disarray within an hour in any moderately busy store. Businesses have to decide what priority to give to the Sisyphean task of maintaining faced shelves, when employees could be engaging in other tasks like stocking which have a more obvious value-add to the business.\n\n\n"}

Written by Sidney Gilliat and Frank Launder, based on the novel \"Report on a Fugitive\" by Gordon Wellesley, the film is about an inventor and his daughter who are kidnapped by the Gestapo after the Nazis march into Prague in the prelude to the Second World War. A British secret service agent follows them, disguised as a senior German army officer pretending to woo the daughter over to the Nazi cause.\n\nAs German forces take over Czechoslovakia in March 1939, Axel Bomasch (James Harcourt), a Czechoslovak scientist working on a new type of armour-plating, is flown to Britain. Bomasch's daughter, Anna (Margaret Lockwood), is arrested before she can reach the airport and sent to a concentration camp, where she is interrogated by Nazis who are after her father. Anna refuses to cooperate. Soon she is befriended by a fellow prisoner named Karl Marsen (Paul Henreid), who says he is a teacher imprisoned for his political views. Together they are able to escape and make their way to London. Anna does not know that Marsen is in fact a Gestapo agent assigned to gain her trust and locate her father.\n\nFollowing Marsen's suggestion, Anna places a cryptic newspaper advertisement to let her father know she is in the country. Soon after, she gets an anonymous phone call with instructions to go to the town of Brightbourne. There, Anna contacts Dickie Randall (Rex Harrison), a British intelligence officer working undercover as an entertainer named Gus Bennett. Randall takes Anna to her father, who is now working for the Royal Navy at the Dartford naval base. Anna argues with Randall over her attempt to post a letter to Marsen (with an informative postmark). It does not matter, as Dr. John Fredericks (Felix Aylmer), Marsen's undercover superior in London, had tailed her to Brightbourne.\n\nSoon after, Marsen arranges the kidnapping of Anna and her father, and brings them back to Germany by U-boat. Their captors threaten to put her in a concentration camp if Bomasch refuses to work for the Nazis. Meanwhile, Randall's proposal to rescue the Bomasches is (unofficially) accepted. He travels to Berlin and infiltrates the building where the Bomasches are being held, posing as Major Ulrich Herzog of the Corps of Engineers. He dupes Captain Prada and Admiral Hassinger into believing he was Anna's lover years ago and can persuade her to get her father to co-operate. Randall spends the night with Anna in her hotel room to maintain the pretense. When the Bomasches are ordered sent to Munich, he plans to accompany them and arrange their escape. However, Marsen shows up just as they are about to leave the hotel; he has been assigned to escort them to Munich.\n\nRandall's situation is further complicated at the railway station, where he is recognised by a former classmate named Caldicott (Naunton Wayne), who is leaving Germany with his friend Charters (Basil Radford). Randall denies knowing Caldicott, but Marsen's suspicions are aroused. When the train makes an unscheduled stop (brought to a halt by a railway station guard played by Irene Handl in an early uncredited bit part) to take on troops, as war has just been declared between Britain and Germany, Marsen takes the opportunity to telephone his headquarters to have Herzog investigated. When Marsen's superiors call back to confirm there is no Major Herzog, Charters, attempting to use another telephone, overhears that Randall will be arrested when they reach Munich.\n\nThe two Englishmen barely manage to reboard the train before it leaves. Caldicott slips a warning to Randall, who is thus prepared when Marsen pulls out a gun as they near Munich. Charters and Caldicott overpower first the two guards, then Marsen. After swapping uniforms with Marsen, Randall commandeers a car. They speed up a mountain road, with Marsen and his men in hot pursuit. They reach an aerial tramway; at the other end is neutral Switzerland. Randall manages to shoot all of their pursuers except Marsen, while Anna and the others escape on the tram. Randall then boards the other tram and exchanges shots with Marsen. Marsen reverses the direction of Randall's tram, but he manages to jump to the other tram as it passes. When he hits Marsen in the leg, the latter is either unable, or unwilling, to reach the controls and stop Randall from reaching safety. Randall and Anna embrace.\n\n\nIt was the last of several films Margaret Lockwood made for Carol Reed. She turned down the female lead in \"Kipps\" which seemed to end their professional relationship.\n\nThe film premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 26 July 1940.\n\nThe film has a rating of 88% \"Fresh\" on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 16 critic reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. Prior to the film's initial release, a review by \"Variety\" noted that \"[m]uch of the film’s merit obviously stems from the compact, propulsive screenplay ... and the razor-edge direction\", adding that \"[t]here are countless touches of atmosphere and comedy that add immeasurable flavor and zest to the picture\".\n\nSimon Abrams of \"Slant Magazine\" wrote of the film: \"Come for Carol Reed's name, stay for Rex Harrison's performance and a few good cheap shots at the Nazis\". Stephen Mayne of \"PopMatters\" wrote that the film is \"more than just a rerun of \"The Lady Vanishes\"\", stating that it \"overcomes wobbly moments by being so persistently fun\".\n\nThe film was released on VHS on 11 February 1997 by Kino Video. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray by the Criterion Collection on 29 June 2010 and 6 September 2016, respectively.\n\nThe film has been compared to \"The Lady Vanishes\", with the Princeton academic Michael Wood describing it as an \"ironic remake\"; the publicity at the time of release erroneously claimed it is a sequel. It has a similar situation in a war-torn continental Europe and both have scripts by Launder and Gilliat. The two slightly eccentric and cricket-mad English travellers, Charters and Caldicott, are carried over. The films are otherwise similar in setting, and both feature similar lead character types: the damsel in distress and eccentric upper-class Englishman, manifesting in the first film as Iris (played by Margaret Lockwood) and Gilbert and in the second as Anna Bomasch (also played by Lockwood) and Dickie Randall.\n\n"}

Later that same year there was a management change and MGM Records' new CEO, Mike Curb, was brought in to try to rescue the financially struggling label. He decided to purge the record company of its unprofitable acts. The Velvet Underground quickly became one of the groups targeted and were released from their contract.

All of these were shelved and forgotten by their record company until the early 1980s.\n\nAs Verve (by then an imprint of Polygram) prepared to re-release the band's three Verve/MGM albums on vinyl and CD, they found nineteen previously unreleased tracks: five Cale-era tracks and the 14 \"lost album\" tracks, some of them in two-track mixdown format, some of them even on multitracks. The cream of the nineteen tracks was released in 1985 as \"VU\"; the rest was released as \"Another View\" in 1986.\n\n\"VU\" is a selection from the 1969 tracks as well as two previously unreleased Cale-era songs—\"Temptation Inside Your Heart\" and \"Stephanie Says\".

The name \"Zoran\" is derived from the Hebrew word for silicon. Zoran was incorporated in the state of Delaware and had offices in Canada, China, England, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the US. Zoran had strong ties with Israel, with a strong R&D presence and being the beneficiary of incentives from organizations such as Israel's Ministry of Industry and Trade.\n\nAfter an early focus on filter and signal processors for military, industrial and medical applications, Zoran started focusing on data compression products for emerging multimedia applications and became better known in the late 1990s as a supplier of Motion JPEG codec chips used on PC add-in cards for video capture and video editing applications. After the turn of the millennium, sales increased substantially as Zoran became a leading provider of chips for DVD players, which it continued to be until about 2007, covering a period during which the production volume of DVD players increased strongly and the semiconductor value in this segment reached its peak. Starting from 2005, Zoran also supplied chips for a substantial portion of the worldwide production of digital cameras. Around 2008 and 2009, Zoran was successful as a supplier of cost-effective integrated chips for LCD TVs supporting the ATSC standards used for HDTV broadcast in the US.\n\nIn 2011, Zoran merged with UK-based CSR and is now represented by the CSR brand and stock. After the merger, CSR executed substantial layoffs of former Zoran employees.\n\nZoran was founded in 1981 by Yuval Almog and Dr. Levy Gerzberg, with a focus on DSP technology.\n\nDue to the similarity between the Zoran Corporation's name and services and those of Max Zorin's fictional company in the James Bond film \"A View to a Kill\", which was released in 1985, a disclaimer had to be added to the film stating that the name Zorin was not related to a real-life company - none of the films producers had been aware of the Zoran Corporation's existence when selecting a name for the villainous Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) and his fictional organisation.\n\nUntil 1991, Zoran derived the substantial majority of its revenues from digital filter processors and vector signal processors used principally in military, industrial and medical applications. In 1989, it repositioned its business to develop and market data compression products for emerging multimedia applications and discontinued development of digital filter processor and vector signal processor products.\n\nZoran became better known through PC video products incorporating Motion JPEG technology, which until 2001 were a significant contributor to Zoran's revenues. The ZR3606x and ZR3650x (with USB interface) family of devices was widely used in PC-based video capture and editing devices. Zoran also offered digital audio products such as the ZR38601, a single-chip digital audio processor designed to support the PC and home theater digital speaker market. Zoran also offered to third parties chip design IP (intellectual property) cores for decoding and encoding NTSC, PAL or SECAM television signals.\n\nIn 1997 Zoran acquired CompCore Multimedia, a provider of software-based compression products and a designer of IP cores for video and audio decoder integrated circuits.\n\nBeginning in 1997, Zoran established itself as a leading provider of MPEG-2 technology for DVD and Super Video CD applications. Although, unlike some competitors, the company had not participated in the first major revenue opportunity for high-volume MPEG-decoding chips, the Chinese Video CD player boom of the late 1990s based on MPEG-1 decoding technology, increasing sales of chips for DVD player applications launched Zoran into a period of strong revenue growth and expansion. For several years starting from 2001, Zoran derived a substantial majority of its product revenues from the sale of DVD player chips.\n\nIn October 2000, Zoran acquired Nogatech, Inc., a manufacturer of integrated circuits that establish connections between video devices and computers as well as connections between video devices across a variety of networks, in exchange for Zoran common stock with a fair value of $154 million.\n\nIn 2003, Zoran purchased Oak Technology in a deal valued at $358 million, thereby expanding its product portfolio with chips used in digital televisions (originally from TeraLogic which Oak had earlier acquired), as well as chips and software used in inkjet printers, laser printers, multi-function printers, and industrial imaging equipment. Zoran also acquired IP related to optical storage technology, which it intended to utilize in chips targeting DVD recorders.\n\nDVD chip sales reached a climax in Q2 2004, after which a significant inventory correction in China greatly affected Zoran. Thereafter, revenues from DVD products declined from a substantial majority of revenues until the middle of 2004 to 8% of revenues by 2010. DVD chip revenues were affected by significant declines in average selling prices and associated commoditization of DVD player chips, resulting in lower revenues and profit margins, and market share loss due to competition from low-cost competitors.\n\nBy 2005, its COACH product line for digital cameras, which built on its earlier JPEG expertise, had started to become significant and would be the largest revenue contributor in Zoran's later years. The printer/imaging business acquired from Oak also consistently contributed in the region of 20% of revenues.\n\nTargeting the mobile phone market, Zoran acquired Emblaze Semiconductor (based in Israel close to a large part of Zoran's own R&D facilities) in 2004 for $54 million in cash. The resulting mobile phone multimedia processor product line eventually achieved limited success with production for LG camera phones in 2008, but could not sustain growth and Zoran discontinued development on this product line in Q3 2009.\n\nZoran's revenues and net income peaked in 2007, with revenues reaching $507 million and non-GAAP net income of $71 million. In 2008, revenues declined to $439 million, with non-GAAP net income declining to $8 million.\n\nThe DTV product line for flat-panel TVs and set-top boxes became successful for Zoran for a period, being the largest revenue contributor with 35% in Q3 2008. After expectations of a significant revenue decline for the company in Q1 2009, an unexpected recovery of its DTV business in Q1 2009 allowed Zoran to maintain its revenue level with DTV reaching 40% of revenues in Q2 and Q3 2009 based on Zoran's leading position in low to mid-range LCD TVs for the US market.\n\nFor 2009, Zoran reported revenues of $380 million, declining from $439 million in the previous year, with a non-GAAP net loss of $13 million. TV revenues increased by 40% over the previous year on market share growth for DTV in the US, with market share reported to have reached 30%. However, by Q2 2010 the DTV business began to see challenges and the outlook for this business was significantly reduced. Around this time frame the market for DTV and digital camera chips started to suffer from increased competition and a trend towards commoditization, which had earlier affected Zoran's DVD chip business, resulting in reduced average selling prices and reduced profit margins.\n\nZoran's last acquisition was that of silicon RF tuner company Microtune Inc. in 2010, for a transaction price of approximately $166 million. Microtune's tuner chips targeted cable set-top box, broadband cable modem, digital TV, and automotive entertainment markets.\n\nZoran posted a non-GAAP net loss of $21.5 million for the year 2010, on revenues of $357 million, with a loss of $15 million for Q4 2010 alone. Despite a material revenue run-rate contributed by the Microtune acquisition (based on quarterly revenues of $24 million in Q2 2010), Zoran reported revenues of $85 million for Q1 2011, with a non-GAAP net loss of $21 million. The company reported a reduced outlook for its digital camera business for the remainder of the year due to Cisco's exit from the video camcorder business. For Q2 2011, its last quarter as an independent company, revenues declined to $83 million with a non-GAAP net loss of $18 million, although it forecast revenue growth to between $100 million and $105 million for the seasonally stronger third quarter of 2011.\n\nOn 21 February 2011, Zoran announced it was merging with CSR, a global leader in wireless connectivity (including WLAN and Bluetooth) and location chip technology such as GPS based in the UK. At the time of the merger agreement, Zoran's board of directors was agitated by hedge fund Ramius LLC, which had said in a letter to the board that it believed Zoran's shares were undervalued. Due to Zoran's decreased business outlook, the offer for Zoran was reduced to about $484 million in June from the originally agreed offer value of about $679 million (based on an all-stock transaction) under mutual agreement, although a significant cash component was introduced. The merger was completed on 31 August 2011, and Zoran now trades under the CSR banner with little mention of the original company name. Zoran described the transaction as a merger, but actually, it is a takeover according to CSR management.\n\nAfter the merger, CSR executed substantial layoffs involving former Zoran employees. The discontinuation of the DTV and silicon tuner divisions was announced at the end of 2011, involving the layoff of 800 employees, which some say caused CSR's share price to jump up substantially. Other divisions were cut as well, and as of the end of 2012, only the COACH (camera-on-a-chip) and Quatro (printer/imaging) product lines still existed. In December 2013 CSR announced it would discontinue development of the COACH platform, with around 200 people being laid off. As of 30 June 2014, CSR had sold the COACH and related camera/video IPs to Qualcomm.\n\nFinally, Qualcomm acquired CSR.\n\nZoran developed and marketed chips that were used in a wide range of consumer and professional electronics devices featuring image compression or video compression, including PC-based video capture and video editing devices, DVD players, DVD recorders, LCD TVs and digital CRT TVs, digital cameras, security cameras, digital TV set-top boxes, printers and related imaging devices, and mobile phones.\n\nAs is common in the semiconductor industry, Zoran was a fabless semiconductor company that outsourced the actual manufacturing of chips to independent foundries such as TSMC. Apart from semiconductor chips, Zoran also commonly provided customers with associated reference designs including a printed circuit board layout and a bill of materials with required components for common configurations, as well associated firmware and software tools, allowing a customer to bring an end product (for example, a DVD player or digital camera) to market faster with a reduced amount of investment while requiring less technical expertise.\n\nExamples of successful chip families sold by Zoran include the Vaddis product line that was widely used in DVD players, especially in earlier brand-name models with upscaled HDMI output (using Zoran's HDXtreme upscaler chip) and by numerous low-cost manufacturers in China, the COACH image processor/video processor product line for digital cameras that saw widespread adoption among both major brands and lower cost manufacturers in Asia and shipped hundreds of millions of units, and the SupraHD product line of integrated SoC solutions for LCD TVs, primarily supporting the ATSC and NTSC standards for the US market.\n\nOther specific target applications included set-top boxes for digital TV deployment in Asia, converter boxes facilitating the transition away from analog terrestrial television in the US, DVD recorders with the Activa product line featuring MPEG-2 encoding, and high-end camera phones with APPROACH camera multimedia processors.\n\nProminent customers and products using Zoran chips included DVD players from brands such as Samsung, LG, Sharp and Toshiba, digital cameras sold under major brands such as Casio, Kodak, Nikon, Olympus, Pentax, Samsung and Sony, LG Viewty camera phones using APPROACH camera processors, budget LCD TVs sold in the US under brands including Insignia, Magnavox, Vizio and Westinghouse using SupraHD DTV processors, and single-function and multi-function printers (involving SoCs as well as software licenses) from brands such as Canon, Epson, HP, Lexmark, and Samsung.\n\n"}

Set in 1964, it is a coming-of-age story about loss and betrayal. It received critical acclaim and was a \"New York Times\" bestseller. It won the 2004 Book Sense Book of the Year Awards (Paperback), and was nominated for the Orange Broadband Prize for Fiction.\n\nThe book was later adapted into a film directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood.\n\nSet in 1964 in the fictitious town of Sylvan, South Carolina, \"The Secret Life of Bees\" tells the story of a 14-year-old white girl, Lily Melissa Owens, whose life has been shaped around the blurred memory of the afternoon her mother was killed. She lives in a house with her abusive father, whom she refers to as T. Ray. They have a no-nonsense maid, Rosaleen, who acts as a surrogate mother for Lily. The book opens with Lily's discovery of bees in her bedroom. Then, after Rosaleen is arrested for pouring her bottle of \"snuff juice\" on three white men, Lily breaks her out of the hospital and they decide to leave town. They begin hitch-hiking toward Tiburon, SC, a place written on the back of an image of the Virgin Mary as a black woman, which Deborah, her mother, had owned. They spend a night in the woods with little food and little hope before reaching Tiburon. There, they buy lunch at a general store, and Lily recognizes a picture of the same \"Black Mary\" but on the side of a jar of honey. They receive directions to the origin of that honey, the Boatwright residence. They are introduced to the Boatwright sisters, the makers of the honey: August, May, and June, who are all black. Lily makes up a story about being an orphan. Lily and Rosaleen are invited to stay with the sisters.\n\nThey learn the ways of the Boatwrights, as well as the ways of bee keeping. With a new home and a new family for the time being, Lily learns more about the Black Madonna honey that the sisters make. She begins working as August's bee keeping apprentice to repay her for her kindness, while Rosaleen works around the house. Lily finds out that May had a twin sister, April, who committed suicide with their father's shotgun when they were younger. She watches June's ongoing flirtations with, and refusals of marriage to, her boyfriend Neil. Lily and Rosaleen also get to see the sisters' form of religion. They hold service at their house which they call \"The Daughters of Mary.\" They keep a statue of \"Black Mary\", or \"our lady of chains\", which was actually a figurehead from the bow of an ancient ship, and August tells the story of how a man by the name of Obadiah, who was a slave, found this figure. The slaves thought that God had answered their prayers asking for rescue, and \"to send them consolation\" and \"to send them freedom\". It gave them hope, and the figure had been passed down for generations.\n\nLily meets Zach, August's godson. They soon develop intimate feelings for each other. They share goals with each other while working the hives. Both Lily and Zach find their goals nearly impossible to meet but still encourage each other to attempt them. Zach wants to be the \"ass-busting lawyer\", which means he would be the first black lawyer in the area. Lily wants to be a short story writer.\n\nLily attempts to tell August the truth but is interrupted by Zach, who takes her for a honey run. They stop at a store to pick up a few things. Zach gets arrested after one of his friends, who they had met at the store, throws a coke bottle at a white man and none of them will tell who did it. Zach and his friends are arrested and put in jail. The Boatwright house decides not to tell May in fear of an unbearable emotional episode. The secret does not stay hidden for long and May becomes catatonic with depression. May leaves the house and August, June, Lily and Rosaleen find her lying dead in the river with a rock on her chest, an apparent suicide.\n\nA vigil is held that lasts four days. In that time, Zach is freed from jail with no charges, and black cloth is draped over the beehives to symbolize the mourning. May's suicide letter is found and in it she says, \"It's my time to die, and it's your time to live. Don't mess it up.\" August interprets this as urging June to marry Neil. May is later buried. Life begins to turn back to normal after a time of grieving, bringing the Boatwright house back together. June, after several rejections, agrees to give her hand in marriage to Neil. Zach vows to Lily that they will be together someday and that they will both achieve their goals.\n\nLily finally finds out the truth about her mother. August was her mother's nanny, and helped raise her. After her marriage to T. Ray began to sour, Deborah left and went to stay with the Boatwrights. She eventually decided to leave him permanently and returned to their house to collect Lily. While Deborah was packing to leave, T. Ray returned home. Their ensuing argument turned into a physical fight during which Deborah got a gun. After a brief struggle, the gun fell to the floor, which Lily picked up and the gun accidentally discharged, killing Deborah.\n\nWhile Lily is coming to terms with this information, T. Ray shows up at the pink house to take her back home. Lily refuses, and T. Ray flies into an enraged rampage. He has a violent flashback which brings him around. August steps in and offers to let Lily stay with her. T. Ray gives in and agrees. However, right before T. Ray leaves the Boatwright house, Lily asks him what really happened the day her mother died. T. Ray confirms that she did do it.\n\n\nAccording to a review in the New York Times, one of the themes in the book is \"Lily's search for a mother\".\n\nReception was generally positive. Although the novel does include the underlying theme of the civil rights movement, \"USA Today\" felt the novel focused more on Lily's journey towards \"self-acceptance, faith and freedom\". The novel was originally published in 2001, and has since sold more than six million copies and has been published in 35 countries. It also maintained its position on the \"New York Times\" best seller list for two and a half years. In 2004, it was named the \"Book Sense Paperback of the Year\". It was also one of \"Good Morning America\"'s \"Read-This\" Book club picks, and was nominated for the Orange Prize in England.\n\nThe book was adapted into a film in 2008, directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood and produced by Will Smith, with Jada Pinkett Smith as executive producer. Queen Latifah played August Boatwright, Dakota Fanning played Lily, Alicia Keys played June Boatwright, Jennifer Hudson played Rosaleen and Sophie Okonedo played May Boatwright.\n\nThe book has been adapted as a musical. A workshop was produced by New York Stage and Film & Vassar in 2017. The world premiere musical adaptation of \"The Secret Life of Bees\" was held at the Off-Broadway Atlantic Theater Company on May 12, 2019 in previews, with the official opening on June 13. The musical's book is written by Lynn Nottage, with music by Duncan Sheik and lyrics by Susan Birkenhead. The musical is directed by Sam Gold and features Saycon Sengbloh as Rosaleen, Elizabeth Teeter as Lily, and LaChanze, Eisa Davis and Anastacia McCleskey as the Boatwight beekeeping sisters.\n"}

{"id": "2224499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224499", "title": "Gang signal", "text": "Gang signal\n\nA gang signal is a visual or verbal way gang members identify their affiliation. This can take many forms including slogans, hand signs and colored clothing. Many of these, especially slogans and hand signs, have become part of popular culture. The wearer usually favors, or is in, that particular gang. With symbols, graffiti is a large symbol displayed on walls or trains.\n\n\"Throwing up\" a gang sign (e.g., \"Stacking\", \"page\", \"gang walk\") with the hands is one of the most known and obvious forms of \"claiming\" or stating the gang one is affiliated with. It is used in many situations where other identifiers may not be possible or appropriate, and it can also show that a gang member is in the area to \"do business\" as opposed to just passing through. Usually these signs are made by formation of the fingers on one or both hands to make some sort of symbol or letter. It can also serve to relay more specific information, such as what set they represent within a larger gang or in which activities they are currently taking part. Individual letters can be used to tell stories when flashed in rapid succession, each representing a word beginning with that letter. These signs, because they are displayed only when wanted (as opposed to the types of identifiers above), are usually the most consistent across various areas. Many of these hand signals are quite close to other common hand signs, and this can cause confusion among gang members, non-gang members, and anti-gang authorities.\n\nAnother identifier that can be displayed only when desired is a gang handshake, which usually includes some component of the gang hand signs and/or other hand and finger symbols.\n\nClothing is a strong signal that all gangs show. The clothing gangs wear allows rival gangs to identify who is friend and who is foe. For example, the uniforms for many Hispanic gangs are standard and easily recognizable. Gangs such as the Latin Kings would wear long yellow T-shirts, baggy pants, and either a bandana or a hat, sometimes both. Black gang members are generally more individualistic with their clothing. The gang would wear a specific clothing and certain accessories that would match their crew's colors. Examples include the Bloods, whose gang colour is red, and the Crips, who wear blue. Most gang members wear brands such as Pro Club, Dickies, & Levi's.\n\nBandanas can be worn in various types of colors and ways. This is done by gang members to signify which gang they are affiliated with. The most popular bandana colors are red, blue, black, white, grey, and yellow. It is typically worn on the left or right back pockets of gang members.\n\n"}
{"id": "2224500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224500", "title": "Laodicean Church", "text": "Laodicean Church\n\nThe Laodicean Church was a Christian community established in the ancient city of Laodicea (on the river Lycus, in the Roman province of Asia, and one of the early centers of Christianity). The church was established in the Apostolic Age, the earliest period of Christianity, and is probably best known for being one of the Seven churches of Asia addressed by name in the Book of Revelation (Rev. 3.14-22).\n\nThe Christian community in Laodicea seems to have been closely connected with that of nearby Colossae (also in the Lycus valley, distant). Laodicea is mentioned four times in the New Testament's epistle to the Colossians (Col. 2:1; 4:13,15,16). In writing to the Colossians, Paul the Apostle sends greetings to them through a Laodicean named Nymphas and the church at their house (Col 4:15). He additionally greets Archippus, who might also be from Laodicea (4:17), and he instructs the Colossians to exchange his letter with one he has written to the Laodiceans (4:16). If the Colossian epistle is genuinely by Paul, then this would indicate a Christian presence in Laodicea as early as the 50s CE. It would also indicate that Laodicea (like Colossae) was not evangelized by Paul, but possibly by his disciple Epaphras\n\nIn Colossians 4:16, Paul states: \"And when this epistle hath been read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye also read the epistle from Laodicea.\" This reference to a letter which the Colossians were to obtain \"from Laodicea\" has created a puzzle which has not yet received a generally accepted solution.\n\nVarious alternatives have been suggested:\n\n\nNo general agreement currently exists as to whether the letter is extant under another name or was lost prior to the formation of the canon.\n\nIn John's vision, recorded in the book of Book of Revelation, Christ instructs John to write a message to the seven churches of Asia Minor. The message to Laodicea is one of judgement with a call to repentance. The oracle contains a number of metaphors.\n\nThe traditional view has been that the Laodiceans were being criticized for their neutrality or lack of zeal (hence \"lukewarm\"). One problem with this is that Christ’s desire that they be either “cold or hot” implies that both extremes are positive. The traditional view saw “cold” as a negative, the idea apparently being that Jesus either wants the readers to be either zealous (“hot”) for him or completely uncommitted (“cold”), but not middle-of-the-road. A middle-of-the-road stance was thought to pollute the pure representation of the faith and create misconceptions about the church and its ideals.\n\nHowever, a more recent interpretation has suggested that this metaphor has been drawn from the water supply of the city, which was lukewarm, in contrast to the hot springs at nearby Hierapolis and the cold, pure waters of Colossae. The archaeology shows Laodicea had an aqueduct that probably carried water from hot mineral springs some five miles south, which would have become tepid before entering the city (see main Laodicea article). The imagery of the Laodicean aqueduct suggests not that \"hot\" is good and \"cold\" is bad, but that both hot and cold water are useful, whereas lukewarm water is emetic.\n\nThe words attributed to the Laodiceans may mark an ironic over-confidence in regard to spiritual wealth; they are unable to recognize their bankruptcy. However the image may also be drawing on the perceived worldly wealth of the city. The city was a place of great finance and banking. In 60 A.D the city was hit by a major earthquake. The city refused help of the Roman empire and rebuilt the city itself.\n\nThe reference to the \"white raiment\" may refer to the cloth trade of Laodicea. The city was known for its black wool that was produced in the area. The reference to eye medication is again often thought to reflect the historical situation of Laodicea. According to Strabo (12.8.20) there was a medical school in the city, where a famous ophthalmologist practiced. The city also lies within the boundaries of ancient Phrygia, from where an ingredient of eye-lotions, the so-called \"Phrygian powder\", was supposed to have originated.\n\nThis is among the most famous images of the Revelation, and is the subject of the famous painting \"The Light of the World\" by Holman Hunt. It bears similarities to a saying of Jesus in Mark 13:33–37, and Luke 12:35–38. The door in the painting has no handle, and can therefore be opened only from the inside.\n\nCommentators variously view it as a metaphor of intimate fellowship, and/or a reference to the eschatological parousia of Christ. The theme of divine invitations to eat are found both in the New Testament (e.g., the Parable of the Wedding Feast) and in Graeco-Roman religion. Commentators have also suggested that Revelation 3:20 is the only New Testament reference to the Old Testament book of Song of Solomon, linking this verse with Song of Solomon 5:2. Various papyri, such as \"POxy 3693\", include invitations to attend a dinner with gods such as Sarapis, but these are issued by specified individuals to feasts at a temple of a god and do not suggest the visitation of the home by the divinity.\n\nThere was a Council in Laodicea, A.D. c.363-64, although the date is disputed. The Council of Chalcedon in 451 approved the canon of this council, making these canon ecumenical. The city remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church, \"Laodicensis in Phrygia\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2224516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224516", "title": "Shehzad Tanweer", "text": "Shehzad Tanweer\n\nShehzad Tanweer (15 December 1982 – 7 July 2005) was one of four men who detonated explosives in three trains on the London Underground and one bus in central London during the 7 July 2005 London bombings. 52 people were killed and over 700 wounded in the attacks.\n\nTanweer was named by Scotland Yard as the man who detonated a bomb while travelling eastbound on the Circle Line between Liverpool Street and Aldgate, killing both himself and seven of the 52 killed in the attacks. The other three men were identified as Hasib Hussain, Germaine Lindsay, and Mohammad Sidique Khan. All four homegrown terrorists were killed in the explosions.\n\nTanweer was born in St Luke's maternity hospital, Bradford to Parveen Akhtar, whose husband, Mohammed Mumtaz Tanweer, was originally from the Faisalabad region of Pakistan. In 1984, the family moved to the Beeston area of Leeds, then to Colwyn Road (also in Beeston) when Tanweer was seven. Known as Kaka (little one) by his family, he attended Wortley High School, where he was described as politically moderate by his friends, who knew him as an outstanding sportsman, excelling at cricket, triple jump, long-distance running, football, and ju-jitsu. He then attended Leeds Metropolitan University, where he studied sports science before leaving for Pakistan in 2004 to attend a course in Islamic studies.\n\nAt the time of his death, Tanweer is believed to have worked occasionally in his father's fish and chip shop. His father had previously owned a curry takeaway and a butcher's shop and was respected locally as a prominent businessman.\n\nTanweer attended several mosques including Bengali and Stratford Street mosque in Beeston, where two of the other London bombers, Mohammad Sidique Khan and Hasib Hussain, are also believed to have worshipped. He also frequented the Hamara Youth Access Point, a drop-in centre for teens, alleged to have been used as a recruitment centre by Khan.\n\nPolice have confirmed that Khan and Tanweer went on a two-hour rafting trip together on 4 June 2005 at the National Whitewater Centre in Snowdonia National Park in Wales. Forensic evidence found in rucksacks after the abortive 21 July London attacks has linked those attacks to a second group of young men of Asian appearance who booked a rafting trip there on the same day as Tanweer and Khan \n\nRelatives in Pakistan have said that Tanweer had boasted of wanting to die as a \"holy warrior\" and that he was enamoured with Osama bin Laden. They noted that incidents such as the Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005 had \"always been in his mind\". Tanweer's body was buried at the shrine of a local Islamic saint in Tanweer's ancestral village in Samundari, Pakistan on 27 October 2005.\n\nAfter completing the hajj earlier in the year, Tanweer travelled to Pakistan for a course in Islamic studies at a madrasa. The Pakistani government has released footage of Tanweer arriving at Karachi International Airport with Mohammad Sidique Khan, believed to be the ringleader of the London bombers, on Turkish Airlines Flight TK 1056 on 19 November 2004. Tanweer and Khan stayed in Pakistan until 8 February, then flew back to London together. The youngest of the London cell, Hasib Hussain, arrived in Karachi from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on 15 July 2004 on Saudi Arabian Airlines Flight SV 714.\n\nIntelligence sources say the school was located in Muridke, Pakistan, 20 miles outside Lahore, named Jamia Manzoorul Islam and is believed to be connected with Lashkar-e-Tayyaba, a banned militant Islamist group. The madrasa has denied any connection with Tanweer.\n\nIt is believed there was a meeting in Faisalabad between Tanweer and Osama Nazir, a suspected member of Jaish-e-Mohammed, who has since been arrested for his role in a grenade attack on a church in Islamabad that killed five. Investigators also believe that Tanweer may have met Zeeshan Siddiqui, who is associated with a number of militant groups and who was arrested in Pakistan two months ago. \n\nA few days before the bombing, Tanweer rented a red Nissan Micra from a local car-rental agency, and at around the same time, dyed his hair and eyebrows light brown, according to friends; this was due to the strong bleaching effect given off by the bombs' ingredients .\n\nOn 7 July, Tanweer, Khan, Hussain, and Lindsay are believed to have picked up the bombs from a house in the Burley area of Leeds, hiding them in large rucksacks, then to have driven to Luton, Bedfordshire in the red Nissan, which he left parked in Luton railway station car park.\n\nIn Luton, the men boarded the 07.48 Thameslink train, arriving at King's Cross in London at 08.20 hours, where they went their separate ways and detonated their bombs.\n\nLondon Underground Ltd has confirmed that the three underground bombs exploded within 60 seconds of each other at 8:50 a.m. \n\nTanweer travelled eastbound on the Circle line from Kings Cross, detonating his bomb on train number 204 between Liverpool Street and Aldgate stations, also killing at least seven people. He was identified from body parts found in the carriage he blew up.\n\nAfter the bombings, police found 16 other bombs in Tanweer's car, several of them so-called \"initiators\" for the rucksack bombs: plastic bottles turned into nail bombs, containing a detonator attached to an electrical cable. Felt-roofing nails were fixed to the outside of the bottles with their tips pointing outwards, apparently intended to cause maximum soft-tissue damage. The devices would then have had cakes of high explosive packed around them.\n\nOn 6 July 2006, a video statement by Tanweer was broadcast by Al-Jazeera. In the video, which included remarks by al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, Tanweer said:\n\n\"What have you witnessed now is only the beginning of a string of attacks that will continue and become stronger until you pull your forces out of Afghanistan and Iraq. And until you stop your financial and military support to America and Israel.\" Tanweer argued that the non-Muslims of Britain deserve such attacks because they voted for a government which \"continues to oppress our mothers, children, brothers and sisters in Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq and Chechnya\" \n\nTanweer's statement was therefore clearer in making this link with British foreign policy than that of Mohammad Sidique Khan, the presumed lead bomber. The video has also served to solidify speculation that both Khan and Tanweer had contact with Ayman Al-Zawahiri and other senior figures in the Al-Qaeda organisation while in Dubai.\n\nThe video also featured a segment by Adam Yahiye Gadahn.\n\nTanweer left behind £121,000, but left no will. A spokesman for the probate department at the High Court said: “The net amount figure of £121,000 is the realisable figure which is what is left after taxes and debts on the estate have been deducted.\"\n\nTanweer's religious credentials as a serious Islamic extremist were cast in a questionable light when, in 2011, evidence emerged that he had a 'secret girlfriend' with whom he had been intimately involved until the very end, for a period of three years beginning in 2002.

{"id": "2224535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224535", "title": "Steam turbine locomotive", "text": "Steam turbine locomotive\n\nA steam turbine locomotive is a steam locomotive which transmits steam power to the wheels via a steam turbine. Numerous attempts at this type of locomotive were made, mostly without success. In the 1930s this type of locomotive was seen as a way both to revitalize steam power and challenge the diesel locomotives then being introduced.\n\n\n\nThere are two ways to drive the wheels: either directly via gears, or using generator-driven traction motors.\n\nThe route from Tucumán to Santa Fe in Argentina goes through mountainous terrain with few opportunities to take on water. In 1925 the Swedish firm NOHAB built a turbine locomotive similar to Fredrik Ljungström's first design. The condenser worked quite well - only 3 or 4% of the water was lost en route and due only to leakage from the tank. The locomotive had reliability problems and was later replaced by a condenser-equipped piston steam locomotive.\n\nTwo attempts were made in France. One effort, the Nord Turbine, resembled the LMS Turbomotive in both appearance and mechanical layout. The project was canceled and the locomotive was built as a compound piston steam locomotive instead. The second attempt, SNCF 232.Q.1, was built in 1940. It was unusual in that its driving wheels were not connected by side rods. Each of its three driving axles had its own turbine. It was heavily damaged by German troops in World War II and was scrapped in 1946.\n\nMultiple attempts at this type were made by German locomotive builders. In 1928 Krupp-Zoelly built a geared steam turbine locomotive. The exhaust of the turbine was fed to a condenser which both conserved water and increased the thermal efficiency of the turbine. Draught for the fire was provided by a steam-driven fan in the smokebox. In 1940, this locomotive was hit by a bomb. It was withdrawn from service and not repaired.\n\nA similar machine was built by Maffei in 1929. Despite having a higher-pressure boiler, it was less efficient than the Krupp-Zoelly locomotive. It was hit by a bomb in 1943 and removed from service.\n\nHenschel converted a normal DRG Class 38 steam locomotive to use a steam turbine in 1927. The locomotive itself was little modified, the major changes being to the tender which was fitted with coupled driving wheels in a 2-4-4 layout, driven by separate forward and reverse turbines. Both turbines were driven by intermediate pressure exhaust steam from the original cylinders. A condenser in the tender provided a vacuum for the turbine exhaust, increasing thermal efficiency. As the final exhaust was at negligible pressure, the original smokebox blastpipe had to be replaced by an electric draught fan in the smokebox.\n\nPerformance was disappointing, and the turbine tender was removed in 1937.\n\nGiuseppe Belluzzo of Italy designed a number of experimental turbine locomotives. None were ever tested on main lines. His first was a small locomotive with four wheels, each fitted with its own small turbine. Reverse movement was accomplished by feeding steam into the turbines via a backwards-facing inlet. Steam turbines are designed to rotate in only one direction, making this method very inefficient. No one else appears to have attempted it.\n\nBelluzzo contributed to the design of a 2-8-2 locomotive built by Ernesto Breda in 1931. It used four turbines in a multiple expansion arrangement. Belluzzo's US patent from that period shows the turbine driving a jackshaft through a gearbox in front of the locomotive's drivers. This locomotive was never completely fitted out.\n\nIn 1933, a FS 2-6-2 Class 685 locomotive was the object of a curious experiment, in which the piston engine was removed and a turbine fitted in its place, leaving the locomotive otherwise completely unchanged. Tests run were however a failure, as its performance proved to be well below that of a normal 685; the turbine soon broke up, and that signalled the end of the attempt. In 1936 the locomotive was refitted with a normal piston engine.\n\nSwedish engineer Fredrik Ljungström designed a number of steam turbine locomotives, some of which were highly successful. His first attempt in 1921 was a rather odd-looking machine. Its three driving axles were located under the tender, and the cab and boiler sat on unpowered wheels. As a result, only a small portion of the locomotive's weight contributed to traction. In the mid-1920s, Ljungström filed a patent on a quill drive for a steam turbine locomotive.\n\nThe second design was a 2-8-0 similar to a successful freight design. Built in 1930 and 1936 by Nydqvist & Holm AB, these locomotives replaced conventional ones on the Grängesberg-Oxelösund Railway. No condenser was fitted, as its complexity outweighed its thermodynamic advantages. The wheels were driven by a jackshaft. These engines were not retired until the 1950s when the line was electrified. Three engines of this type were built, all three of which have been preserved. These can currently be seen in the Railway Museum of Grängesberg, two (71 and 73) being owned by the Grängesbergbanornas Järnvägsmuseum (GBBJ) and the third (72) by the Swedish Railway Museum.\n\nThe Swiss firm Zoelly built a turbine locomotive in 1919. It was a 4-6-0 locomotive fitted with a condenser. It was fitted with a cold-air blower feeding into the firebox grate rather than a suction fan in the smokebox. This avoided the complexity of building a fan that could withstand hot, corrosive gases, but introduced a new problem. The firebox was at positive pressure, and hot gases and cinders could be blown out the firebox doors if they were opened while the blower was operating. This potentially dangerous arrangement was eventually replaced with a smokebox fan.\n\nOne of the more successful turbines operated in the United Kingdom, the LMS \"Turbomotive\", built in 1935, was a variation of the \"Princess Royal\" 4-6-2 large passenger express locomotive. There was no condenser. Although a disadvantage for thermal efficiency of the turbine, it allowed the turbine exhaust to still be used through a blastpipe to draw the fire, as for a conventional steam locomotive and avoiding the separate draught fans that caused so much trouble for other turbine locomotives. See paper by Roland Bond \"J. Instn Loco. Engrs\"., 1946, 36 (Paper 458) via \nDespite this limitation, it had greater thermal efficiency than conventional locomotives. The high efficiency mainly resulted from the fact that there were six steam nozzles directed into the turbine which could be turned on and off individually. Each nozzle could thus be allowed to operate, or not, at full power, rather than being inefficiently throttled to a lower pressure. A certain amount of inspiration appears to have come from Fredrik Ljungström's turbines in Sweden.\n\nThe main turbine failed after eleven years in heavy service. The Turbomotive was converted to piston drive in 1952, renamed \"Princess Anne\" and shortly after entering service was withdrawn following the deadly Harrow and Wealdstone railway accident in 1952.\n\n\nAnother locomotive was built by Beyer-Peacock, using the Ljungström turbine by Fredrik Ljungström. Like one of Ljungström's early designs, the driving wheels were under the tender. Performance was disappointing, however, partly because of poor heating of the boiler.\n\nAnother unit was rebuilt by the North British Locomotive Company. In its first incarnation (described below) it had an electrical transmission. Only a few tests were done before it was abandoned due to mechanical failures.\n\nIn the waning years of steam, the Baldwin Locomotive Works undertook several attempts at alternative technologies to diesel power. In 1944, Baldwin built the sole example of the S2 class, c/n 70900, for the Pennsylvania Railroad, delivering it in September 1944. It was the largest direct-drive steam turbine locomotive in the world and had a 6-8-6 wheel arrangement. It was originally designed as a 4-8-4, but due to shortages of lightweight materials during World War II, the S2 required additional leading and trailing wheels. Numbered 6200 on the PRR roster, the S2 had a maximum power output of 6,900 HP (5.1 MW) and was capable of speeds over . With the tender, the unit was approximately long. The steam turbine was a modified marine unit. While the gearing system was simpler than a generator, it had a fatal flaw: the turbine was inefficient at slow speeds. Below about 40 mph (64 km/h) the turbine used enormous amounts of steam and fuel. At high speeds, however, the S2 could propel heavy trains almost effortlessly and efficiently. The smooth turbine drive put far less stress on the track than a normal piston-driven locomotive. However, poor efficiency at slow speeds doomed this turbine, and with diesel-electrics being introduced, no more S2s were built. The locomotive was retired in 1949 and scrapped in May, 1952.\n\nThe Reid-Ramsey turbine, built by the North British Locomotive Company in 1910, had a 2-B+B-2 (4-4-0+0-4-4) wheel arrangement. Steam was generated in a standard locomotive boiler, with superheater, and passed to a turbine generator. Exhaust steam was condensed and recirculated by small auxiliary turbine pumps. The armatures of the motors were mounted directly on the four driving axles. It was later rebuilt as a direct-drive turbine locomotive as seen above.\n\nThe Armstrong-Whitworth turbine, built in 1922 (image right), had a 1-C+C-1 (2-6-6-2) wheel arrangement. It was fitted with a rotary evaporative condenser, in which the steam was condensed by passing it through a rotating set of tubes. The tubes were dampened and cooled by the evaporation of water. The loss of water from evaporation was far less than what it would have been with no condenser at all. The airflow in the condenser had to take a convoluted path, reducing the condenser's efficiency. The locomotive was overweight and a poor performer. It was returned in 1923 and scrapped.\n\nGeneral Electric built two steam turbine-electric locomotives with a 2+C-C+2 (4-6-6-4) wheel arrangement for the Union Pacific Railroad in 1938. These locomotives essentially operated as mobile steam power plants and were correspondingly complex. They were the only condensing steam locomotives ever used in the United States. A Babcock & Wilcox boiler provided steam, which drove a pair of steam turbines which powered a generator, providing power to the electric traction motors that drove the wheels, as well as providing head-end power for the rest of the train. Boiler control was largely automatic, and the two locomotives could be connected together into a \"multiple unit\", both controlled from a single cab. The boiler was oil-fired, and the fuel was \"Bunker C\" heavy fuel oil, the same fuel used in large vessels, and also the fuel which was later used in Union Pacific's gas turbine-electric locomotives. Union Pacific accepted the locomotives in 1939, but returned them later that year, citing unsatisfactory results. The GE turbines were used during a motive power shortage on the Great Northern Railway in 1943, and appear to have performed quite well. However, by the end of 1943, the wheels of both locomotives were worn to the point of needing replacement, and one of the locomotive's boilers developed a defect. The locomotives were returned to GE and dismantled.\n\nIn 1947–1948 Baldwin built three unusual coal-fired steam turbine-electric locomotives for passenger trains on the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O). Their designation was M1, but because of their expense and poor performance they acquired the nickname \"Sacred Cow\". The units, which had Westinghouse electrical systems, had a 2-C1+2-C1-B wheel arrangement. They were 106 feet (32 m) long. The cab was in the center with a coal bunker ahead of it and a backwards-mounted conventional boiler behind it (the tender only carried water). These locomotives were intended for a route from Washington, D.C. to Cincinnati, Ohio but could never travel the whole route without some sort of failure. Coal dust and water frequently got into the traction motors. While these problems could have been fixed given time, it was obvious that these locomotives would always be expensive to maintain and all three were scrapped in 1950.\n\nIn May 1954 Baldwin built a steam turbine-electric locomotive for freight service on the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W), nicknamed the \"Jawn Henry\" after the legend of John Henry, a rock driller who famously raced against a steam drill and won, only to die immediately after. Length including tenders was 161 ft 1-1/2 inches, probably the record for a steam locomotive; engine-only length was 111 ft 7-1/2 inches, perhaps the record for any single unit.\n\nThe unit looked similar to the C&O turbines but differed mechanically; it was a C+C-C+C with a Babcock & Wilcox water-tube boiler with automatic controls. The boiler controls were sometimes problematic, and (as with the C&O turbines) coal dust and water got into the motors. The \"Jawn Henry\" was retired from the N&W roster on January 4, 1958.\n"}

It is the third installment in the \"X-Men: Mutant Academy\" fighting game series, following \"\" and \"\".\n\n\"Next Dimension\" expands upon the concept of the first two games by adding several new characters, 3D maps, and a story mode, which allows the player to fight a series of battles in between short movies that move the plot along. The game's plot serves as a sequel to the events of the comic story \"\".\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are tailored to a very gradual learning curve: super attacks are performed by pressing two punch or kick buttons simultaneously, and multi-hit combos can be executed by pressing the punch and kick buttons in a particular order (a feature similar to Darkstalkers' chain combos). The game features an extensive combo system, including normal chains, air juggles, and air launchers. In addition to the basic blocking system, players have various counterattacks available to them that can be executed by simply pressing the counterattack button and a direction on the controller. The counter-attacks are specific to the type of attack the player is countering.\n\nThe fighting stages are fully 3D rendered stages with their own layouts. As in \"Dead or Alive\" it is possible to knock an opponent to a different part of the stage, which functions as its own individual stage. In the X-Mansion, for example, an opponent can be knocked from the Hangar to the Hallway, then to the outer courtyard where, after the 2nd round, the basketball court opens up, allowing a player to be knocked back into the Hangar.\n\nWhile in Story Mode, only a limited set of characters are available for each battle; Arcade Mode allows the player to select from any of the playable characters in a series of eight battles. The Two-Player Versus Mode also allows players to choose from any of the unlocked characters. The game also features a Survival Mode, in which a single player is pitted against a never-ending flow of computer-controlled opponents in a test of endurance.\n\nIn addition to the standard moves, the player can also access special and super attacks. The special attacks include blasts/beams (some of which can stun an opponent), physical attacks that have special effects (such as moving to one side before hitting) and attack throws. There are several different types of super attacks, and each have four different levels of power.\n\nMany of the attacks and motions in the game are influenced by those available to the player in the \"Marvel vs. Capcom\" series. Three of Wolverine's attacks (his level 3 super, his Adamantium attack, and its super) are examples of this.\n\nThe GameCube version includes exclusive modes: Team and Practice. The Xbox version features an extra stage and the ability to play as Pyro.\n\nNarrated by Patrick Stewart (reprising his role as Professor Charles Xavier from the \"X-Men\" movies), the game's plot is built around the Prime Sentinels retrieving the head of Bastion, and Bastion's subsequent attempt to wipe out mutant-kind. The game opens with the Prime Sentinels freeing Bastion from S.H.I.E.L.D. imprisonment, then disguising themselves and selling the defense plans of Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters -the X-Men's home and training grounds- to the Brotherhood of Mutants. The game then moves forward to Forge fighting off Mystique and Nightcrawler in a city ravaged by a Prime Sentinel invasion. The graves of Anthony Stark, Warren Worthington III, Peter Parker, and Benjamin Grimm can be seen in the background. This is revealed to be a Danger Room simulation, and the X-Men begin training their adaptivity by fighting opponents who have a tactical advantage.\n\nDuring this training session, Juggernaut and the Brotherhood (consisting of Mystique, Toad, and Sabretooth) make their assault on the mansion. Xavier is curious as to the nature of their attack, worrying that it seems \"too focused, almost like a distraction\" and sends Forge to investigate the grounds. He discovers that the attack was a distraction, and that the grounds are now being patrolled by Prime Sentinels.\n\nAfter attempting to fight off the Sentinels, Forge is abducted and the Brotherhood retreats. Restrained in the company of Bastion, the seemingly human Sentinel tells Forge he intends to use the man's mutant gift to bring about the extinction of mutants. He steals various weapon designs from Forge's mind, including a powerful weapon capable of stripping a mutant of their powers. In an attempt to throw the X-Men off his scent, He sends the Brotherhood to different locations across the world. The X-Men split up and engage each member in a bid to find Forge and stop the Prime Sentinel. After their defeat, the Brotherhood retreats to find Magneto in the Savage Land, only to find that Magneto has been hunted down by the Sentinels as well and is no longer in control of his fortress. The X-Men, having followed the Brotherhood, also arrive and Magneto charges the Brotherhood to fight them off long enough to convince them to join forces.\n\nWith the X-Men and the Brotherhood forming a temporary alliance, the team fights their way through a legion of Sentinels, though not without losses of their own. In the end, Magneto, Wolverine, Juggernaut and Phoenix invade the tower for the final battle with Bastion. Bastion uses Magneto's trans-mat system to transport Juggernaut away from the tower, then escapes to Asteroid M, but he is followed by a piggybacking Wolverine. Wolverine, whose healing factor was disabled by the Sentinels earlier, manages to defeat Bastion. Magneto and Phoenix arrive to help Wolverine, and Magneto prevents a weakened Bastion from escaping again. The two battle, and Magneto is defeated.\n\nWhen Bastion returns to the central room, he finds Phoenix, who challenges and finally defeats him. The Prime Sentinels are disbanded, and the X-Men and the Brotherhood agree to a temporary cease-fire while the wounded are restored to health. Forge is freed and reverses the effects of his weapon, restoring everything to normal. With Bastion returned to S.H.I.E.L.D., the X-Men are free to continue training to fight for a better future.\n\nUpon reaching the ending level of Asteroid M, the player has the chance to fight Bastion as three characters: Wolverine, then Magneto, and finally Phoenix. Whether Wolverine defeats Bastion or is defeated himself, the game proceeds to Magneto's fight with Bastion. If Magneto defeats Bastion, the finale video is simply accelerated and Phoenix does not fight Bastion. If Magneto is defeated, Bastion and Phoenix comprise the final fight of the game.\n\nAlternate endings:\n\n\"X-Men: Next Dimension\" features twenty-four playable characters. Many can be unlocked through gameplay in other modes, and alternate costumes for each character are also available. The main costumes for each character are based on the two main X-Men comics at the time, \"New X-Men\" and \"X-Treme X-Men\". Of these, two are essentially mirrors of other characters, although still retaining their individuality: Phoenix is essentially similar to the unlockable Dark Phoenix, although the two differ in certain Supers (Phoenix's are more psi-based, while Dark Phoenix takes her powers from the fiery appearance of the Phoenix). Similarly, Betsy and Psylocke are essentially the same character, save that \"Psylocke\" is based on the Betsy Braddock's telepathic incarnation and employs a \"psi-blade\" emerging from her fist, and \"Betsy\" is based on the more recent telekinetically powered version and manifests a fully formed psionic katana in combat.\n\nMuch like \"\" and unlike \"\", \"X-Men: Next Dimension\" received mixed or average reviews. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 61.79% and 61 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version; 59.30% and 56 out of 100 for the Xbox version; and 62.62% and 63 out of 100 for the GameCube version. Some critics and fans said \"Next Dimension\" is the best game in the \"Mutant Academy\" franchise. Others criticized the GameCube and Xbox versions for its inspiration from \"Dead or Alive 3\". Despite the criticism, many praised all versions for its improved gameplay, new characters, and excellent 3D environments.\n"}

In Shakespeare's tragedy \"Othello\", the flaw in Othello himself is his vulnerability to jealousy and his tendency to believe Iago, who is manipulating Othello into believing his wife is unfaithful. As a result of this flaw Othello loses a loyal friend, murders his wife, and is driven insane before eventually committing suicide. In this scenario the Wheel of Fire begins with the action of Othello trusting Iago and consequently the other events occur.\n\nThe Wheel of Fire is most commonly applied to the protagonist within a tragedy (i.e. the hero) and may aim to provoke sympathy from the audience when the hero falls from grace (this purging of emotions is known as \"catharsis\"), though it also adds dramatic interest to the performance.\n\nThe Wheel of Fire is also the title of G. Wilson Knight's book on Shakespearean tragedy.\n\nIn Shakespeare's \"King Lear\", Lear states: \"But I am bound upon a wheel of fire, / That mine own tears do scald like molten lead\".\n\nIn J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\" the One Ring is described as a \"wheel of fire\".\n\nAlso: \"A crouching shape, scarcely more than the shadow of a living thing, a creature now wholly ruined and defeated, yet filled with a hideous lust and rage; and before it stood stern, untouchable now by pity, a figure robed in white, but at its breast it held a wheel of fire.\" -- A description of Gollum and Frodo, respectively, as seen by Samwise.\n"}

The purpose is to provide access to the clip for people with slower Internet connections, and yet still allow people with faster connections to enjoy the higher quality content. The server automatically chooses which stream to deliver to the user, depending on user's connection speed.\n\n, Ogg Vorbis bitrate peeling existed only as a concept as there was not yet an encoder capable of producing peelable datastreams .\n\nAn experimental implementation of bitrate peeling can be found here. However, re-encoding files at a lower bitrate will preserve more quality than this experimental bitrate peeler.\n\nThe difference between SureStream and Bitrate Peeling is that SureStream is limited to only a handful of pre-defined bitrates, with significant difference between them, and SureStream encoded files are big because they contain all of the bitrates used, while Bitrate Peeling uses much smaller steps to change the available bitrate and quality, and only the highest bitrate is used to encode the file/stream, which results in smaller files on servers.\n\nA related technique to the SureStream approach is hierarchical modulation, used in broadcast, where severally different streams at different qualities (and bitrates) are all broadcast, with the higher quality stream used if possible, with the lower quality streams fallen back on if not.\n\nA similar technology is to feature a combination of a lossy format and a lossless correction; this allows stripping the correction to easily obtain a lossy file. Such formats include MPEG-4 SLS (Scalable to Lossless), WavPack, DTS-HD Master Audio and OptimFROG DualStream.\n\nA SureStream encoded file is encoded at bitrates of 16 kbit/s, 32 kbit/s and 96 kbit/s. The file will be about the same in size as three separate files encoded at those bitrates and put together, or one file encoded at the sum of those bitrates, which is about 144 kbit/s (16+32+96).\nWhen a dial-up user has only about 28 kbit/s of bandwidth available, the Real server will serve the 16 kbit/s stream. If the dial-up connection is of higher quality, and maybe about 42 kbit/s is available, the server will automatically switch to the 32 kbit/s stream. A DSL or cable Internet user will be served the 96 kbit/s stream.\nThis looks good, but even though the user with 28 kbit/s can use a higher bitrate / higher quality stream (maybe 22 to 24 kbit/s), such thing can't be done with SureStream, unless the encoded file contains such a bitrate. This is where Bitrate Peeling comes into play.\n\nContrary to SureStream, Bitrate Peeling requires only the highest bitrate to be used when encoding a file/stream, which is 96 kbit/s in this case. The obvious benefit is much smaller space on a server required by such a file.\nAn additional feature of Bitrate Peeling is a much finer tuning of available bitrate/quality.\n\nIf a dial-up user with 28 kbit/s available bandwidth connects to an Ogg Vorbis file/stream, the server will \"peel\" the original 96 kbit/s file/stream down to just below available bandwidth (in this case it would be around 20-24 kbit/s). \nThis \"peeling\" process is different from transcoding because transcoding uncompresses the file and recompresses it (a computing-intensive process), whereas the peeling process \"cuts the fat\" by removing excess bits from the stream without using much processor time.\n\nAside from the obvious space-saving advantage Bitrate Peeling allows for smaller steps in the delivery bitrate (the end user will see the file in the highest quality possible for their bandwidth).\n\nThese benefits are only theoretical, as the only Vorbis peeler available is still in experimental state and produces file qualities inferior to what transcoding the higher bitrate file to a lower bitrate would.\n\nBitrate peeling is theoretically possible, and is implemented in some other formats, notably JPEG 2000, JPEG progressive encoding, and Scalable Video Coding.\n\nThe reason that it is not available in Ogg Vorbis is that current encoders do not organize the code-stream to have progressive accuracy, thus peelers cannot tell which data is more or less important.\n\nSee also the Adam7 algorithm used in PNG interlacing.\n\n\n"}

It also provided three kings of Norway, and one king of Denmark in the 14th century.\n\nThe house has been known as the \"House of Folkung\" since the 17th century, and this name is still the most commonly used in Swedish works of reference. The name \"folkung\" does appear as early as in 12th century sources, but is then usually not applied to members of the family.\n\nIn an effort to avoid confusion with the Folkunge Party some modern historians have argued that \"House of Bjälbo\" would be a better name because Birger Jarl lived there and it is the family's oldest known manor. Bjälbo is located in Östergötland, outside of Skänninge in the present-day commune of Mjölby. In any case the members of this dynasty never used a name to refer to themselves since family names were not widely adopted in Sweden until the 16th century, thus neither name is more \"correct\" for the dynasty, apart from the potential for confusion.\n\nThe House of Bjelbo produced most of the jarls in Sweden in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries until the title was abolished in 1266. Different branches of the family were often rivals for the office of jarl. Most of the kings during that time were also from Östergötland.\n\nAround 1100, Folke the Fat became the first known Bjelbo jarl, and probably the first jarl of all Sweden, under king Inge I of Sweden. He was married to a daughter of king Canute IV of Denmark. According to legends, he was the first of his family so elevated. Nothing is known of any of Folke's collateral relatives, though it is well-established that several of his sons' descendants were important lords.\n\nOther notable jarls from the family were Birger Brosa, Charles the Deaf, Ulf Fase, and Birger jarl. In the early 13th century, some members of the family moved to Norway, and held the office of jarl there. Noteworthy is that regardless of the ruling royal family, Bjelbos continued to hold the position of the jarl in the kingdom.\n\nSeveral members of the family were also Bishops of Linköping at least in the 13th century. Diocese covered the area of Östergötland. Bishop of Linköping was often involved in the eastern activities.\n\nEarly Dukes of Finland were from the House of Bjelbo and used the traditional coat of arms with a rampant lion. This developed later to the current Coat of arms of Finland during the reign of Johan as Grand Duke of Finland, the lion from which serves as the symbol of the state and in stylized forms various authorities.\n\nValdemar, a son of Birger jarl, was elected as the King of Sweden in 1250. House of Bjelbo had gradually married to all rival royal dynasties in Sweden eventually producing an heir related to them all. When the previous king Eric had died without an heir apparent, his sister's son, and also Birger's son, was the most suitable option to hold the royal office.\n\nMembers of the house reigned as kings Sweden until 1364. From 1319 to 1387, they were also kings of Norway. Almost all subsequent monarchs of Sweden, Norway and Denmark trace cognatic descent from the House of Bjelbo.\n\nParticularly, several persons conventionally assigned as sons and grandsons to Benedict Snivel, son of Folke the Fat, may actually be related to him in a different way. Conventional assignments stretch two generations to cover a hundred years, which is probably not realistic, and three generations over 150 years.\n\n\nThis article is fully or partially based on material from \"Nordisk familjebok\" (1908).\n\n"}

He grew up in rural New South Wales during the Great Depression. At age nineteen Piper enrolled in the Australian Army, serving in the 2nd/2nd Australian Field Regiment in New Guinea from 1942 until 1946, he was discharged in November 1946. Following his war service he completed a Rehabilitation Training course and moved to Sydney.\n\nPiper illustrated comic strips including \"Catman\" and \"Kalar the Caveman\" for Frew Publications' comic book, Super Yank Comics. \"Catman\" was a feline-styled caped crusader who, unlike the original American version of the character, had no secret identity or powers. The other noticeable difference was that Catman's sidekick was changed from a young girl, Kitten, to a young boy, Kit. \"Catman\" ran for 19 issues, between 1951 and 1952. According to Jim Shepherd (the late publisher and managing director of Frew Publications), \"[Frew co-founder], Ron Forsyth had an almost strange habit of changing things in the imported titles he published. He didn't like females having or sharing top billing, hence his request to replace Kitten with Kit – but he probably also thought it might be some sort of plug for the young Phantom character, also known as Kit.\"\n\nPiper also created \"Steel Barr\" for OPC's Hurricane in 1946 and \"Lemmy Loo\" as a filler strip for K.G Murray's Captain Triumph Comics (October 1949 – February 1950). \"Steel Barr\" was resurrected by Young's Merchandising in 1950, under the title \"Steel Barr and The Phantom Man\". Australian comic book researcher, Kevin Patrick, describes \"Steel Barr\" as being \"a granite-jawed District Commissioner who patrolled the African jungles, battling myriad threats while searching for his elusive opponent, The Phantom Man.\"\n\nPiper subsequently became an advertising layout artist, working in the advertising industry for the next twenty two years. He also taught Graphic Design part-time, from 1970 until 1983, at the National Art School.\n\nIn October 1972 the Sunday Telegraph commissioned Piper to draw a comic strip, \"Wolfe\", for which ran for six years before it was dropped in favour of a syndicated American superhero. \"Wolfe\" was a wandering adventurer. According to John Ryan, in his Australian Comic anthology, \"Panel by Panel\", \"\"Wolfe\"'s strength was its strong story line and the fact Piper restricted his wanderings to Australia, giving readers an opportunity to identify with the various suburbs and country towns – and it was these aspects that attracted a large following for the strip.\" Following the death of Ron Vivian Piper was invited by Jimmy Bancks's family to take over the role of writing and illustrating Ginger Meggs, which was also published by the Sun Telegraph. Piper was the first of Bancks' successors permitted to sign his name to the strip. On 27 August 1977 the Ginger Meggs strip moved back to Sun Herald replacing long time rival comic strip, Fatty Finn. Piper claimed he kept as close as he could to the Bancks style with Ginger Meggs, and in an interview in 1983, stated \"I have worked 30 years in advertising. I understand all the aspects of other peoples wants. I have striven to maintain Bancks' character, but admit that his sense of humour was so individual, his successors can hope for, but never really match it.\" He also told friends it was \"just a job\", and that \"they don't pay me much and they get what they pay for\".\n\nIn 1953 Piper married Essie Gwendoline 'Gwen' Armstrong and they had one son, John William Piper (b. 1956). Piper died in a car accident on 5 September 1983.\n\n"}

The region is the second largest region in terms of land area, and has a population of 531,860. Woodlands is the regional centre and also the most populous town with 250,290 residents living in the area. Comprising 13,500 hectares of land area, it includes eight planning areas.\n\nThe relative isolation of the area from the Downtown Core meant relatively belated urban development and the greater abundance of natural greenery. Still, the region includes one of Singapore's largest new towns, Woodlands. Largely grouped into three new towns, it houses 129,000 residential housing units of various types, although public housing tends to dominate. Excluding naturally occurring green spaces, the region has 3 square kilometres of recreational spaces.\n\nPlanning considerations for the Singapore Master Plan 2003 involving the North Region took into consideration its existing strengths. With a good mix of various housing types, the region also has established industrial areas particularly in Sungei Kadut and Senoko which provide for employment opportunities close to the residential areas. Transportation, which used to be considered difficult, has been improved tremendously with the completion of the Bukit Timah and Seletar Expressways, and the introduction of the Mass Rapid Transit's North South line. There are adequate commercial facilities with the siting of the Woodlands Regional Centre in the area, as well as recreational facilities. In addition, there is an abundance of green spaces, untouched forests, and even farmland, which are a rarity in Singapore today.\n\nThe burgeoning population in Singapore meant more space could be reserved for residential housing in the region. The newly built Sembawang New Town will expand northwards to the Senoko Industrial area. Another new town will be built in Simpang.\n\nIn terms of commercial needs, the Woodlands Regional Centre will be further developed. Large tracts of land remain awaiting potential development, with the potential of even taping into the market of residents in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, across the Strait of Johor. More industrial areas to meet employment needs are also planned for the region.\n\nGiven the large tracts of virgin forests within the region, care will be taken to protect and enhance them. New parks and park connectors are planned for, and a new sports complex will be built in Sembawang New Town. Facilities built for the new Republic Polytechnic campus may also be opened for public use.\n\nWith a total land area of , the region is situated on the northern corner of Singapore Island, bordering the North-East Region to the east, West Region to the south-west and the Straits of Johor to the north.\n\nThe North Region is governed locally by the North West CDC and is divided into 8 planning areas.\n\nSembawang Shipyard is a shipyard specialises that in ship repairs and fabrication. Owned by SembCorp Marine, the shipyard has the deepest dry dock in Southeast Asia. Formerly a British naval base, the shipyard was built in 1938 as the Sembawang Naval Base. After Singapore's independence, the naval base was converted into a commercial shipyard under the management of Sembawang Corporation (now known as SembCorp).\n\nThe region is home to several attractions, namely the Singapore Zoo, Night Safari and River Safari. In June 2016, it was announced that a eco-tourism hub will be developed in Mandai. Together with the current zoological parks, the area will feature eco-friendly accommodations such as camps, tents, and family rooms. Jurong Bird Park will be relocated to the area, and the new bird park will be connected to a rainforest sanctuary, as part of the plan, with an expected completion date by 2020.\n\nResidents living within the area have access to different educational facilities ranging from preschools to primary and secondary schools, as these are located around the different towns in the East region. The area is also home to various tertiary institutions such as, Republic Polytechnic, Yishun Junior College and Innova Junior College and a special needs school, MINDS.\n\n"}

He was a warrior who escaped from a train that was sending the scouts and renegades to Florida to be held with Geronimo and Chihuahua.\n\nMaybe Massai's true Apache name was Nogusea (according to Jason Betzinez and James Kaywaykla, meaning \"crazy\") and he was enlisted as a member of Chatto´s band as Ma-Che.\n\nBorn to White Cloud and Little Star at Mescal Mountain, Arizona, near Globe. He later married a local Chiricahua and they had two children. \n\nMassai later met Geronimo, who was recruiting Apache to fight American settlers and soldiers. Massai and a Tonkawa named Gray Lizard agreed to join Geronimo, who instructed them to lay in supplies of arms, food, and ammunition. Other sources state that Massai also served the United States government on two separate occasions, once in 1880 and the other in 1885, as an Apache Scout. Upon traveling to meet Geronimo's forces, the two were informed that Geronimo had been arrested. Both men were arrested by Chiricahua Apache Scouts and disarmed. Massai was placed onto a prison train as a prisoner of war along with Gray Lizard, who voluntarily agreed to accompany Massai, together with the remaining Chiricahua Apache who had either been captured or had surrendered to the army. This included the Apache Scouts, who were now deemed expendable and undesirable. \n\nMassai and Gray Lizard later escaped from the prison train near Saint Louis, Missouri. The two men walked some 1,200 miles back to the Mescalero Apache tribal area, crossing the Pecos River, and Capitan Gap. Near Sierra Blanca, New Mexico, the two men encountered a group of Mescalero Apache. Several days later, the two parted at Three Rivers, never to see each other again. Gray Lizard departed for Mescal Mountain and the San Carlos Indian Reservation near present-day Globe, Arizona, while Massai stayed on the run, raiding along what is today the New Mexico-Arizona border, and periodically taking refuge across the border in Mexico. His name appeared in San Carlos Agency reports from 1887 to 1890. He later kidnapped and married (c.1887) a Mescalero Apache girl named Zan-a-go-li-che and took her home to his family at Mescal Mountain. Massai and Zanagoliche had six children together.\n\nMassai's later life and death are the subject of some dispute. One account states that in 1906, Massai, after contracting tuberculosis, took his wife and their children back to their home with the Mescaleros in New Mexico. Along the way he was killed by a posse, west of the town of San Marcial, New Mexico, between Socorro and Hot Springs, though no evidence of Massai's death was ever produced. Some believed the Apache Kid was actually the man who died that day so the area was later named the Apache Kid Wilderness.\n\nAnother account states that Massai escaped over the border to Mexico, eventually settling in the Sierra Madre mountains with a group of rebellious Chiricahuas who had refused to surrender with Geronimo. \n\nMassai was portrayed by Burt Lancaster in the 1954 film \"Apache\".\n\n\n"}

The service failed to attract a sufficient number of users and was finally shut down in August 2003.\n\n\"Quest for Fame\" is a simulation adventure game where the player becomes a rock guitarist, working his way up from lonesome bedroom rehearsals to becoming a garage band member, playing clubs and ultimately becoming a rock legend.\n\nThe game is based on tunes by Aerosmith and is played by a special device called \"V-Pick\" that's included in the box. The device is connected to the PC via the parallel port. It contains simple vibration sensing electronics so that the player can simulate playing a guitar by strumming it along a tennis racket, a baseball bat or just the thigh.\n\nVirtual Music also sold a more realistic virtual guitar device that could be connected to the computer's serial port. Additional buttons permitted adjusting the player's guitar volume and feedback effects in the game. Instead of being equipped with full strings, there was only a small part of the guitar with exposed nylon strings or one metal string on the body.\n\nThe game contains cartoon-ized artwork consisting of drawn backgrounds with embedded video sequences played by actors.\n\nThe game includes a helpful display called the \"Rhythm EKG\" (short \"REKG\"), indicating the guitar activity of the currently playing song in the upper half and the player's input in the lower half.

Investigators found his body and personal effects on the bus. At the age of 18, he was the youngest of the group of four. The other men were Shehzad Tanweer, Germaine Lindsay, and Mohammad Sidique Khan.\n\nHussain was born in Leeds General Infirmary and raised in Holbeck, West Yorkshire, Leeds, England, the youngest of four children. His father, Mahmood, of Pakistani origin, worked in a factory, while his mother, Maniza, was an interpreter for British Pakistani families at Leeds General Infirmary. At the time of the bombing, Hussain was living with his brother Imran and sister-in-law Shazia. \n\nHussain received his primary education at Ingram Road Primary School, Holbeck. In September 1998, he began his secondary education at South Leeds High School — formerly the Matthew Murray High School. Maintaining a good attendance record, he received GCSEs in English language, English literature, maths, science, Urdu, and design technology and a GNVQ in business studies in 2003. Hussain went on to attend Thomas Danby College in Leeds, earning a Vocational Certificate of Education (AVCE) in business the same year as the attacks. He was a member of the Holbeck Hornets football team and the local cricket team. When he left Matthew Murray High School, teachers who knew him described him as \"a slow gentle giant\" who \"did not spread leaflets of hate-mail\".\n\nIn the latter half of 2003, Hussain met Mohammed Sidique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer. The three frequented the Stratford Street mosque in Beeston, and were also intimately associated with the Hamara Youth Access Point, a drop-in centre for teens. Hussain was cautioned by police for shoplifting in 2004.\n\nThere were media reports that Hussain had travelled to Pakistan in February 2004, but these appear to be a case of mistaken identity.\n\nIn mid-June 2005, Magdi Asdi el-Nashar, an Egyptian lecturer at the University of Leeds, rented a flat from Dr. Adnan Shukir. Hussain played the role of el-Nashar's purportedly foreign friend. Sources differ, but either Hussain's brother or the police examined Hussain's mobile phone, which had Dr. Shukir's number in its memory. Police raided the flat, finding kilos of explosives and other evidence of a bomb-making operation.\n\nBefore Hussain went to London with Khan and Tanweer, all three men had travelled to 18 Alexandra Grove, Hyde Park, Leeds where the homemade explosive devices were assembled. The bombs were placed into a refrigerated box to maintain stability overnight. In the morning they travelled south towards Luton railway station, where they met up with Germaine Lindsay, the fourth bomber, at around 7:20 am. They then made the trip towards King's Cross station.\n\nOn the day of the attacks, Hussain is believed to have intended to take the Northern line train. However, it was temporarily suspended on 7 July and so Hussain left the London Underground system. He was captured on CCTV in a Boots store on the concourse of King's Cross after the other bombs had gone off. Mobile phone records indicate that he had tried to telephone the other bombers. About 50 minutes after the other bombs had detonated, Hussain appears to have boarded the number 30 bus, his bomb exploding shortly thereafter: driving licence and credit cards were found in the wreckage of the bus in Tavistock Square.\n\nHussain's parents contacted the Scotland Yard emergency helpline at about 10:20 pm on 7 July to report that their son had been travelling to London with three friends and had not been heard from since.\n\nHussain's body was buried in a Muslim cemetery in Leeds on 2 November 2005.\n\n\n"}

Afterwards he lived for a while with his father in Traralgon, Victoria.\n\nKemsley attended the Independent School of Dramatic Art, North Sydney (1968–71) as well as a National Institute of Dramatic Art Playwright Forum in 1973 and a RADA Professional Workshop in London in 1979.\nKemsley's background was in acting and television. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Kemsley was known to television audiences as \"Skeeter the Paperboy\", an on-screen cap-wearing persona (who once said his full name was Amos Skeeter - a play on \"a mosquito\") that he portrayed as a cast member of \"The Super Flying Fun Show,\" and then as host of \"Skeeter's Cartoon Corner\" in Sydney and Melbourne, both on the Nine Network.\n\nThe daily afternoon program offered a mix of US-based cartoons (such as \"Wacky Races\", \"Scooby-Doo\" and \"The Archies\"), with viewer competitions. One of his tag lines on the telephone with viewer contestants who were unsuccessful was \"golly gosh\". When Kemsley left in 1973, Daryl Somers took over the time slot.\n\nIn 1973 Kemsley compered a variety program on the Nine Network titled \"Junior Cabaret\". He also appeared in the ABC TV mini-series \"The Cousin From Fiji\" and \"Seven Little Australians\".\n\nKemsley studied acting at the Independent Theatre of Dramatic Art from 1969–1972 under Doris Fitton and attended the Playwright Forum at the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) in 1973 under the directorship of David Whittaker. He went on to write three children's plays: \"The Land Of Coloured Dreams\", \"Once Upon A Time... And All That\" and \"The Magical Adventures of Puck\".\n\nKemsley left Channel Nine and then studied in England at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA) in 1979.\n\nIn 1984 Kemsley was invited to take over the syndicated comic strip, \"Ginger Meggs\", and several comic books featuring the character have since been published.\n\nHe has also contributed to \"The Traralgon Journal\", Adelaide's \"Sunday Mail\", Sydney's \"The Sun-Herald\", \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" and \"The Daily Telegraph\". Kemsley twice served as President of the Australian Cartoonists' Association.\n\nAwards include the 2001 Stanley Award for Cartoonist of the Year, presented by the Australian Cartoonist's Association. In 1990 & 2004, Kemsley received the Stanley for Comic Strip Artist, as voted by his peers. Under Kemsley's pen and Atlantic Syndication's marketing, \"Ginger Meggs\" now appears in newspapers in over 120 newspaper in 30 countries.\n\nKemsley continued to draw the \"Ginger Meggs\" strip until he died at his home in Bowral, New South Wales on 3 December 2007 after a two-year battle with motor neuron disease.\n\n\n"}

There are a total of 55 of these areas, organised into five regions. A Development Guide Plan is then drawn up for each planning area, providing for detailed planning guidelines for every individual plot of land throughout the country.\n\nThe planning areas were first introduced in the early 1990s after the release of the 1991 Concept Plan. Since the implementation of these boundaries, other government ministries and departments have also increasingly adopted these boundaries for their administrative purposes. For example, the Statistics Department of Singapore published its 2000 census data based on planning area boundaries for the first time, compared to using census divisions based on electoral boundaries for previous exercises. The Singapore Police Force's (SPF) neighbourhood police centres have jurisdiction boundaries based on planning area boundaries when they were officially gazetted in 1999, as opposed to electoral divisions under the previous neighbourhood Police Post system.\n\nPlanning Areas are further subdivided into subzones for statistical purposes.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> = Place names attested to be of Malay origin and referred to similarly in the Malay language.\n\n\n"}

Khan bombed the Edgware Road train killing himself and six other people.\n\nOn 1 September 2005, a videotape emerged featuring Khan. The videotape, shown by Al Jazeera Television, also shows Ayman al-Zawahiri, who is the highest leader of al-Qaeda. The two men do not appear together, and the British government says that al-Qaeda was not connected with the bombing. The Home Office believes the tape was edited after the suicide attacks and dismisses it as evidence of al-Qaeda's involvement. In the film, Khan declares, \"I and thousands like me have forsaken everything for what we believe\" and refers to his expectation that the media would already have painted a picture of him in accordance with government \"spin\". He goes on to say, \"Your democratically elected governments continually perpetrate atrocities against my people all over the world. Your support makes you directly responsible. We are at war and I am a soldier. Now you too will taste the reality of this situation.\"\n\nBorn in St James's University Hospital, Leeds, Khan grew up in Beeston but moved to Lees Holm in Dewsbury, near Leeds in early 2005. His father, Tika Khan, a foundry worker, was born in Pakistan. His mother is Mamida Begum. He received his secondary education at South Leeds High School, formerly the Matthew Murray High School, which was also attended by Hasib Hussain, 7 July bus bomber. After completing his secondary education, he attended Leeds Metropolitan University to complete a degree in business. It was during this time that he met his wife Hasina Patel, and first became interested in extremist Islam.\n\nIn 1999 he came under the influence of radical cleric Abdullah el-Faisal.\n\nKhan worked at Hillside Primary School in Leeds as a \"learning mentor\" with the children of immigrant families who had just arrived in Britain. Khan's colleagues commented that he was a quiet individual who did not talk about his religious or political beliefs.\n\nKhan was also involved in the community-run Hamara Healthy Living Centre in Beeston, and worked at its youth outreach project, the Hamara Youth Access Point (HYAP). Staff at the centre have confirmed that two of the London bombers, Shehzad Tanweer and Hasib Hussain, frequented the HYAP. Khan used the outreach project as a recruitment centre, according to a friend of his who spoke to \"The Guardian\".\n\nHis mother-in-law, Farida Patel, is also involved in education and works as a council liaison officer at a school in Dewsbury. In 1998 she was the first Asian woman to be invited to a Buckingham Palace garden party, meeting the Queen and other members of the royal family, in recognition for her work amongst the Muslim community in Dewsbury, and again in 2004. She was said to have been \"devastated\" by the actions of her son-in-law.\n\nMohammad Sidique Khan reportedly postponed the event from 6 July 2005 because he had to take his pregnant wife to the hospital.\n\nOn the morning of 7 July 2005, Khan travelled by car with his three accomplices to Luton in Bedfordshire, where the four men caught a train to London King's Cross railway station.\n\nFrom there, Khan entered the London Underground and boarded a Circle Line train heading west, travelling four stops to Edgware Road. The bomb detonated at 8.50 a.m., just as the train was pulling out of Edgware Road station, killing six British victims. Personal documents of Khan's were found on the train.\n\nKhan is alleged to have travelled regularly to Dubai to attend military training camps, and is also believed to have spent time in Israel.\nIn 2001 Khan was alleged to have learned bomb-making at the Malakand training camp.\nHe is also alleged to have trained with Indonesian terror group Jemaah Islamiyah and to be directly involved with the 2002 Bali bombing.\n\nAccording to the Israeli newspaper \"Maariv\", Khan travelled to Israel on 19 February 2003, staying only one night and leaving the next day. \"Maariv\" reports that he was suspected of having helped to plan the 30 April 2003 suicide bombing of the Mike's Place bar in Tel Aviv which killed three Israelis, carried out by two British citizens of Pakistani descent. The Israeli government allegedly played down the report.\n\nAccording to Ron Suskind's \"The One Percent Doctrine\", the NSA had been monitoring phone calls and emails between Khan and several Islamic radicals from the United States and England, including Ahmed Omar Abu Ali. Just prior to Khan's planned trip to the US, NSA intercepted email exchanges between him and some of his associates discussing a desire to \"blow up synagogues on the East Coast\". According to Suskind, the CIA wanted to let Khan into the US so that the FBI could put him under surveillance, but the FBI resisted on grounds that, as one FBI case agent stated, \"We just can't take the risk ... he goes up and blows up a temple in Washington.\" US government officials put Khan on a no-fly list to prevent him from entering the country. Suskind was critical of the decision, which the author suggested tipped him off to the fact that he was known to US authorities and might have caused him to be more cautious with his communication to avoid further surveillance.\n\nBritish intelligence sources and circumstantial evidence suggested that this theory may have resulted from a confusion between two different Mohammed Khans, although it seems that Suskind stood by his claim.\n\nAccording to David Leppard in \"The Sunday Times\", Khan was assessed by MI5 in 2004, after his name appeared during an investigation into a plan to detonate a 600-lb truck bomb in London. MI5 concluded that Khan's link to the plotters was indirect, and he was not placed under surveillance. MI5 was later criticised for failing to follow up leads relating to Khan. The service responded to the criticisms. Channel 4 News published what it said were excerpts from the transcript of the tape.\n\nUS intelligence officials have said that Khan was known to Mohammed Junaid Babar, who has pleaded guilty in the US to providing material support to al-Qaeda. Babar, who told investigators that he worked on a plan to blow up pubs, railway stations, and restaurants in the UK, identified Khan as someone he had met in Pakistan.\n\nOn 18 July 2005, the Pakistani government released video footage of Khan arriving at Dubai airport on 19 November 2004 with Shehzad Tanweer, another of the London bombers. Khan and Tanweer stayed in Pakistan until 8 February 2005, then flew back to London together. A third member of the London group, 18-year-old Hasib Hussain, arrived in Karachi on 15 July 2004 from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on flight SV714.\n\n\n"}

The content is paradoxical and written from the perspective of the machine. The song also picks up lyrically where \"The Learning\" left off in \"The Politics of Ecstasy\".

It was also ranked #88 on the October 2006 issue of \"Guitar World\" magazine's list of the greatest 100 guitar albums of all time.\n\nAllmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia praised \"the soaring vocals of Warrel Dane and lead guitar heroics of Jeff Loomis\" as \"twin beacons shining out from the band's gloriously metallic bulk.\" He declared, \"Don't forget the near-nine-minute title track, which culminates in what must surely stand as one of Nevermore's most consistent LP's in suitably epic fashion. Indeed, American-bred heavy metal doesn't get any better than this.\"\n\nThe album's review via PopMatters noted the complex influences as \"traces of '80s progressive metal greats such as Queensrÿche, Savatage, and Fates Warning\" as well as \"monstrous doses of European elements, such as blazingly fast tempos, tautly performed arrangements, and unrelenting blastbeats.\" In one of PopMatters' only complaints, the song \"Bittersweet Feast\" was considered \"one track too many on an otherwise extraordinary album.\" Overall, within Nevermore's catalog, \"This Godless Endeavor\" was touted as \"yet another chapter in what has become one of the more impressive album streaks in recent metal history.\"\n\nThe German Rock Hard voted it \"Album of the Month\" and called it \"the best and most intense metal album of the decade\".

Although he wished to interpret the numerous Arabic modes (known as \"maqamat\", singular \"maqam\") on his instrument, he nevertheless found this quite difficult, as the necessary \"half-sharps\" and \"half-flats\" could only be obtained via the unreliable method of modulating lip pressure.\n\nFinally, Maalouf realized that adding to his trumpet a fourth valve half the length of the second valve would allow for the production of quarter tones. Maalouf worked for two years with the craftsman Michel Wikrikaz of the Henri Selmer company in Paris to produce his design of a \"quarter-tone\" trumpet and flugelhorn, both suitable for performing Arabic \"maqamat\" throughout the full chromatic range of the instrument.\n\nMaalouf uses his right hand to play the first three valves and the index finger of his left hand to depress the fourth valve.

{"id": "2224640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224640", "title": "Word square", "text": "Word square\n\nA word square is a special type of acrostic. It consists of a set of words written out in a square grid, such that the same words can be read both horizontally and vertically. The number of words, which is equal to the number of letters in each word, is known as the \"order\" of the square. For example, this is an order 5 square:\n\nA popular puzzle dating well into ancient times, the word square is sometimes compared to the magic square, though apart from the fact that both use square grids there is no real connection between the two.\n\nThe Sator Square is a famous word square in Latin. Its canonical form reads as follows.\n\nIn addition to satisfying the basic properties of word squares, the Sator Square spread widely due to several other attributes: it is palindromic; it can be read as a sentence of obscure meaning; and additional meaning such as reference to the Christian Paternoster prayer can be derived from its letters. However, the word \"Arepo\" appears nowhere else in Latin literature; most of those who have studied the Sator Square agree that it is to be taken as a proper name, either an adaptation of a non-Latin word or, more likely, a name invented specifically for this sentence. Thus the square consists of a palindrome (\"tenet\"), a reversal (\"sator\" and \"rotas\"), and a word (\"opera\") which can be reversed into a passably coined name (\"Arepo\").\n\nIf the \"words\" in a word square need not be true words, arbitrarily large squares of pronounceable combinations can be constructed. The following 12×12 array of letters appears in a Hebrew manuscript of \"The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage\" of 1458, said to have been \"given by God, and bequeathed by Abraham\". An English edition appeared in 1898. This is square 7 of Chapter IX of the Third Book, which is full of incomplete and complete \"squares\". \n\nNo source or explanation is given for any of the \"words\", so this square does not meet the modern standards for legitimate word squares. Modern research indicates that a 12-square would be essentially impossible to construct from indexed words and phrases, even using a large number of languages. However, equally large English-language squares consisting of arbitrary phrases containing dictionary words are relatively easy to construct; they too are not considered true word squares, but they have been published in \"The Enigma\" and other puzzle magazines as \"Something Different\" squares.\n\nA specimen of the order-six square (or 6-square) was first published in English in 1859; the 7-square in 1877; the 8-square in 1884; and the 9-square in 1897.\n\nHere are examples of English word squares up to order eight:\n\nThe following is one of several \"perfect\" nine-squares (all words in major dictionaries, uncapitalized, and unpunctuated):\n\nA 10-square is naturally much harder to find, and a \"perfect\" 10-square has been hunted since 1897. It has been called the Holy Grail of logology.\n\nVarious methods have produced partial results to the 10-square problem:\n\nSince 1921, 10-squares have been constructed from reduplicated words and phrases like \"Alala! Alala!\" (a reduplicated Greek interjection). Each such square contains five words appearing twice, which in effect constitutes four identical 5-squares. Darryl Francis and Dmitri Borgmann succeeded in using near-tautonyms (second- and third-order reduplication) to employ seven different entries by pairing \"orangutang\" with \"urangutang\" and \"ranga-ranga\" with \"tanga-tanga\", as follows:\n\nHowever, \"word researchers have always regarded the tautonymic ten-square as an unsatisfactory solution to the problem.\"\n\nIn 1976, Frank Rubin produced an incomplete ten-square containing two nonsense phrases at the top and eight dictionary words. If two words could be found containing the patterns \"SCENOOTL\" and \"HYETNNHY\", this would become a complete ten-square.\n\nFrom the 1970s, Jeff Grant had a long history of producing well-built squares; concentrating on the ten-square from 1982 to 1985, he produced the first three traditional ten-squares by relying on reasonable coinages such as \"Sol Springs\" (various extant people named Sol Spring) and \"ses tunnels\" (French for \"its tunnels\"). His continuing work produced one of the best of this genre, making use of \"impolarity\" (found on the Internet) and the plural of \"Tony Nader\" (found in the white pages), as well as words verified in more traditional references:\n\nBy combining common first and last names and verifying the results in white-pages listings, Steve Root of Westboro, Massachusetts, was able to document the existence of all ten names below (total number of people found is listed after each line):\n\nAround 2000, Rex Gooch of Letchworth, England, analyzed available wordlists and computing requirements and compiled one or two hundred specialized dictionaries and indexes to provide a reasonably strong vocabulary. The largest source was the United States Board on Geographic Names National Imagery and Mapping Agency. In \"Word Ways\" in August and November 2002, he published several squares found in this wordlist. The square below has been held by some word square experts as essentially solving the 10-square problem (\"Daily Mail\", \"The Times\"), while others anticipate higher-quality 10-squares in the future.\nThere are a few \"imperfections\": \"Echeneidae\" is capitalized, \"Dioumabana\" and \"Adaletabat\" are places (in Turkey and Guinea respectively), and \"nature-name\" is hyphenated.\n\nMany new large word squares and new species have arisen recently. However, modern combinatorics has demonstrated why the 10-square has taken so long to find, and why 11-squares are extremely unlikely to be constructible using English words (even including transliterated place names). However, 11-squares are possible if words from a number of languages are allowed (\"Word Ways\", August 2004 and May 2005).\n\nIt is possible to estimate the degree of difficulty of constructing word squares. 5-squares can be constructed with as little as a 250-word vocabulary. Roughly, for each step upwards, one needs four times the number of words. For a 9-square, one needs over 60,000 9-letter words, which is practically all of those in single very large dictionaries.\n\nFor large squares, the vocabulary prevents selecting more \"desirable\" words (i.e. words that are unhyphenated, in common use, without contrived inflections, and uncapitalized), and any resulting word squares use exotic words. The opposite problem occurs with small squares: a computer search will produce millions of examples, most of which use at least one obscure word. In such cases finding a word square with \"desirable\" (as described above) words is performed by elimination of the more exotic words or by using a smaller dictionary with only common words. Smaller word squares, used for amusement, are expected to have simple solutions, especially if set as a task for children; but vocabulary in most eight-squares tests the knowledge of an educated adult.\n\nWord squares that form \"different\" words across and down are known as \"double word squares\". Examples are:\n\nThe rows and columns of any double word square can be transposed to form another valid square. For example, the order 4 square above may also be written as:\n\nDouble word squares are somewhat more difficult to find than ordinary word squares, with the largest known fully legitimate English examples (dictionary words only) being of order 8. Puzzlers.org gives an order 8 example dating from 1953, but this contains six place names. Jeff Grant's example in the February 1992 \"Word Ways\" is an improvement, having just two proper nouns (\"Aloisias\", a plural of the personal name Aloisia, a feminine form of Aloysius, and \"Thamnata\", a Biblical place-name):\n\nDiagonal word squares are word squares in which the main diagonals are also words. There are four diagonals: top-left to bottom-right, bottom-right to top-left, top-right to bottom-left, and bottom-left to top-right. In a Single Diagonal Square (same words reading across and down), these last two will need to be identical and palindromic because of symmetry. The 8-square is the largest found with all diagonals: 9-squares exist with some diagonals.\n\nThis is an example of a diagonal double square of order 4:\n\nWord rectangles are based on the same idea as double word squares, but the horizontal and vertical words are of a different length. Here are 4×8 and 5×7 examples:\n\nAgain, the rows and columns can be transposed to form another valid rectangle. For example, a 4×8 rectangle can also be written as an 8×4 rectangle.\n\nNumerous other shapes have been employed for word-packing under essentially similar rules. The National Puzzlers' League maintains a full list of forms which have been attempted.\n\n\n"}

The name is an exonym assigned by the Romans, who conquered and incorporated it into the Roman Republic. Picenum was the \"Regio V\" in the augustan territorial organization of Italy. Picenum was also the birthplace of such Roman notables as Pompey the Great and his father Pompeius Strabo. It was situated in what is now Marche and the northern part of Abruzzo. The Piceni or Picentes were the native population of Picenum, but they were not of uniform ethnicity. They maintained a religious centre in Cupra Marittima, in honor of the goddess Cupra.\n\nPicenum and the Picentes are described in some detail by the Roman geographers.\n\nStrabo places Picenum between the Apennines and the Adriatic Sea from the mouth of the Aesis River southward to Castrum at the mouth of the Truentinus River, some 800 stadia, which is using 185 m/stadion. For cities he includes from north to south Ancona, Auxumum, Septempeda (San Severino Marche), Pneuentia, Potentia, Firmum Picenum with port at Castellum (Porto di Fermo), Cupra Maritima (Grottammare), Truentum on the Truentinus (Tronto) and finally Castrum Novum and Matrinum on the Matrinus (Piomba), south of Silvi in Abruzzo. This is a list of coastal communities. Strabo also mentions Adria (Atri, Italy) and Asculum Picenum (Ascoli Piceno) in the interior. The width of Picenum inland varies irregularly, he says.\n\nFirst settled at the beginning of the Iron Age (1200400), Picenum later became one of the eleven districts of Italy. The three interior towns of the region possessed an urban layout and appeared to be economically successful, so it is unknown what caused this city to decline in later years. The Liburnians had colonies at the western Adriatic coast, especially in region of Picenum, from the beginning of the Iron Age. From the 9th to the 6th century there was certain koine - cultural unity in the Adriatic, with the general Liburninan seal, whose naval supremacy meant both political and economical authority in the Adriatic Sea through several centuries.\n\nIn 268 BC the consuls Appius Claudius Russus and Publius Sempronius Sophus conducted a pincer operation against Picenum. The Picentes, who were then Roman allies, had rebelled. Part of the population was deported and those who were not were given Roman citizenship without the right to vote. Thus, Picenum was annexed, except for the city of Ausculum, which was considered an allied city. To keep her under control, the colony of Firmum was established nearby in 264 BC.\n\nAccording to Polybius (\"Histories\" 2:21), during the consulship of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (232), \"the Romans divided among their citizens the territory in Gaul known as Picenum, from which they had ejected the Senones when they conquered them\".\n\nPicenum is best known for siding with Rome against Hannibal during the Punic Wars. It also became a Roman base during the Social War. Some Picentes remained loyal to Rome in the war, while others fought against them for the right of Roman citizenship. All Picentes were granted full Roman citizenship after the war.\n\nIn the Edict of Diocletian, it was mentioned that the wine from Picenum was considered as the most expensive wine, together with Falerno. Vinum Hadrianum was produced in Picenum, in the city of \"Hatria\" or \"Hadria\", the old name of Atri. This is also the same wine that Pliny considered as one of the highly-rated wines, along with a few others.\n\nExcavations performed in the late 19th century in Picenum give some insight into the region during the Iron Age. Excavated tombs in Novilara of the Molaroni and Servici cemeteries show that the Piceni laid bodies in the ground wrapped in garments they had worn in life.\n\nWarriors would be buried in the ground with a helmet, weapons and vessels for food and drinks. Buried beads, bone, fibulae and amber seem to demonstrate that there was an active trade in the ninth and perhaps tenth centuries on the Adriatic coast, especially in the fields of amber and beads of glass paste. In women’s graves there is a large abundance of ornaments made of bronze and iron.\n\nOrigins of these items may also show that the Piceni may have looked to the south and east for development.\n\nThe warrior tombs seem to show that the Piceni were a war-like people. Every man’s grave contained more or less a complete outfit of a warrior, with the most frequent weapon being a spear. Piceni swords appear to be imported from the Balkans.\n\nSouth Picene, written in an unusual version of the Italic alphabet, has been identified as a Sabellic language that is neither Oscan nor Umbrian.\n\nThe undeciphered North Picene, also written in a form of the Old Italic alphabet, is probably unrelated and, at present, it is generally assumed not to be an Indo-European language.\n\nAs reported by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia, 24 cities were placed in \"Regio V\":\n\n\n"}

It is one of the two Old Believers churches that belong to the Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy - together with the Orthodox Old-Rite Church, sometimes also called Lipovan Orthodox Old-Rite Church. \n\nSince the 18th century until the Council of 1988, the official self-designation of this Church was the Old Orthodox Church of Christ (\"Древлеправославная Церковь Христова\") which should not be confused with Russian Old-Orthodox Church, another church of the Old Believers. \"Drevlepravoslavie\" (\"Old/Ancient Orthodoxy\") was the common self-designation of the Old Believers and their cause since the 17th century.\n\nThe head of the Church carries the title of \"Metropolitan of Moscow and all Russia\" (since 1988), with residence at the Rogozhskoye cemetery in Moscow. The current head of the Church, Metropolitan Korniliy (Titov) (formerly, the archbishop of Kazan and Vyatka) was elected by the Most Holy Council on October 18, 2005. He was installed as Metropolitan on October 23, 2005.\n\nThe conversion of Met. Amvrosii caused a bitter reaction of Russian Imperial authorities and he was soon pressed to leave his see, but not before he consecrated another bishop for his new Church - archbishop Kiril (Timofeev). The activity of the Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy on the territory of the Russian Empire met with numerous obstructions from Russian imperial authorities, as well as with an internal schism (see Okruzhniki, Neokruzhniki). The situation was radically changed with the publication in 1905 of the Emperor's Ukaz \"On Religious Tolerance\", soon followed by the \"unsealing\" of the altars at the important religious and cultural center of Old Believers, the Rogozhskoye cemetery.\n\nAfter the coming of the Bolsheviks to power in 1917 and the Civil war, the Old-Rite Church was subjected to innumerable sufferings and persecutions, just as its former rival, the \"Nikonian\" Russian Orthodox Church. In 1940, the only bishop who was not imprisoned by the Soviet atheistic authorities was Bishop Sava of Kaluga who, in the same year, single-handedly elevated another bishop - Irinarch - to the see of the Archbishop of Moscow. The period of persecution was followed by the period of relative stability, under a tight control from the Soviet secret services. However, the time of perestroika and subsequent changes in the country's political, cultural and economic life had a little effect on the position of the Old-Rite Church in the Russian society - the 17-year tenure of Metropolitan Alimpiy (Gusev) is by some considered a time of \"recollection\".\n\nHis follower, Metropolitan Andrian (Chetvergov) in the February 2004, showed himself as a charismatic and talented leader, concerned with formulating and propagating the cultural and religious \"message\" of the Old Believers for the modern Russian society. While declaring himself as traditionalist and conservative in his public statements, Andrian took a significant step forward in initiating some form of a dialogue with the Russian Orthodox Church and Russian political establishment. Unfortunately, many such plans were cut short with the unexpected death of Metropolitan Andrian on August 10, 2005 during pilgrimage in one of the remote regions of Russia (he had a chronic heart condition). Many questioned the willingness of the church leadership to continue on the \"new course\" chosen by Andrian. However, the new Metropolitan Korniliy, elected on October 18, 2005, confirmed that he will continue on the policy of openness to the Russian society, started by his predecessor.\n\nThe head of the Church is the Metropolitan of Moscow and All Russia (archbishop in 1846–1988), residing at the Rogozhskoye cemetery in Moscow. He is elected by the highest representative body of the Church - the Holy Council (Освященный Собор). The Council also appoints the members of the Council of the Metropolitanate.\n\nThe Church has five local bishops and more than 250 parishes in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. Since several years ago, there have been attempts to restore theological schools for training priests for the Old-Rite Church.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church belong to the Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy and was until the 16/29 May 2008 in full ecclesiastical and canonical communion with the Lipovan Orthodox Old-Rite Church.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is located 15 miles (24 km) west of Towner, North Dakota.\n\nThe forest contains about 30 species of woody plants, labeled and planted in a park-like setting, including Scots pine, ponderosa pine, Siberian larch, Black Hills spruce, Elaeagnus, and Rocky Mountain juniper. Wildlife includes deer, wild turkeys, porcupines, elk, and sometimes moose. The forest is also popular with birdwatchers.\n\nThe forest was established in 1931 on a site extensively over-plowed and overgrazed during the early part of the 20th century, leaving wind-blown sand dunes and economic hardship. It was originally envisioned as part of a grand plan by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to plant a 100-mile (160 km) wide \"shelterbelt zone\" from North Dakota to north Texas to reduce wind erosion and eliminate dust storms, as well as provide local employment in the Great Depression via a jobs program. Proponents envisioned a forest as large as 480,000 acres (1900 km²) around the forest's current site.\n\nThis grand vision never came to pass, and the forest was established with the more modest goals of determining which types of shelterbelt trees would grow well in the northern Great Plains, which seed sources within species are best adapted for the region, and which methods of tree establishment are most effective for shelterbelts. The Forest Service acquired of the 636 in 1931, and the State of North Dakota retained control of the other 596 acres (2.4 km²). In 1971, the Forest Service acquired the entire tract. The entire section has been managed as one unit for experimental purposes since 1931, however. More than 40 species were planted from throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia, of which about 30 species have survived.\n\nThe forest has also been used cooperatively by the Custer National Forest, North Dakota Forest Service, Agricultural Research service, and North Dakota State University, Fargo. It is no longer being used for research, although it currently provides approximately 500,000 seedlings per year for wind protection of crops and communities throughout the United States and Canada.\n\nThe forest is now in the process of being de-commissioned and returned to the administrative control of the Custer National Forest.\n\n"}

{"id": "2224692", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224692", "title": "Gasoline gallon equivalent", "text": "Gasoline gallon equivalent\n\nGasoline gallon equivalent (GGE) or gasoline-equivalent gallon (GEG) is the amount of alternative fuel it takes to equal the energy content of one liquid gallon of gasoline. GGE allows consumers to compare the energy content of competing fuels against a commonly known fuel—gasoline. GGE also compares gasoline to fuels sold as a gas (natural gas, propane, hydrogen) and electricity.\n\nIn 1994, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defined \"gasoline gallon equivalent (GGE) means 5.660 pounds of natural gas.\" Compressed natural gas (CNG), for example, is a gas rather than a liquid. It can be measured by its volume in standard cubic feet (ft³) (volume at atmospheric conditions), by its weight in pounds (lb) or by its energy content in joules (J) or British thermal units (BTU) or kilowatt-hours (kW·h). It is difficult to compare the cost of gasoline with other fuels if they are sold in different units. GGE solves this. One GGE of CNG and one GGE of electricity have exactly the same energy content as one gallon of gasoline. CNG sold at filling stations in the US is priced in dollars per GGE.\n\nUsing GGE to compare fuels for use in an internal combustion engine is only the first part of the equation whose bottom line is useful work. In the context of GGE, a real world kind of \"useful work\" is miles per gallon (MPG) as advertised by motor vehicle manufacturers.\n\nSubstituting one fuel for another in a given engine may start and may do useful work. However getting optimum efficiency from each fuel–engine combination requires adjusting the mix of air and fuel. This can be a manual adjustment using tools and test instruments or done automatically in computer-controlled fuel injected and multi-fuel vehicles. Fine tuning of the optimum fuel–air mix may be facilitated by using a supercharger or turbocharger.\n\nIn battery or electric vehicles, calculating efficiency of useful work begins with the charge–discharge rate of the battery pack, generally 80% to 90%. Next is the conversion of potential energy (BTU) of the charge to distance traveled under power. See table below translating retail electricity costs for a GGE in BTU.\n\nNote that throughout this article, 'gallon' refers to the US gallon of approximately 3.8 litres, as opposed to the imperial gallon of approximately 4.5 litres\n\nRates per kWh for residential electricity in the USA range from $0.0728 (Idaho) to $0.166 (Alaska), \n$0.22 (San Diego Tier 1, while Tier 2 is $.40) and $0.2783 (Hawaii).\n\nOne GGE of natural gas is at standard conditions. This volume of natural gas has the same energy content as one US gallon of gasoline (based on lower heating values: of natural gas and ).\n\nOne GGE of CNG pressurized at is . This volume of CNG at 2,400 psi has the same energy content as one US gallon of gasoline (based on lower heating values: of CNG and of gasoline. Using Boyle's law, the equivalent GGE at is .\n\nThe National Conference of Weights & Measurements (NCWM) has developed a standard unit of measurement for compressed natural gas, defined in the NIST Handbook 44 Appendix D as follows:\n\"1 Gasoline [US] gallon equivalent (GGE) means 2.567 kg (5.660 lb) of natural gas.\"\n\nWhen consumers refuel their CNG vehicles in the USA, the CNG is usually measured and sold in GGE units. This is fairly helpful as a comparison to gallons of gasoline.\n\n of ethanol has the same energy content as of gasoline.\n\nThe energy content ethanol is , compared to for gasoline. (see chart above)\n\nA flex-fuel vehicle will experience about 76% of the fuel mileage MPG when using E85 (85% ethanol) products as compared to 100% gasoline. Simple calculations of the BTU values of the ethanol and the gasoline indicate the reduced heat values available to the internal combustion engine. Pure ethanol provides 2/3 of the heat value available in pure gasoline.\n\nIn the most common calculation, that is, the BTU value of pure gasoline vs gasoline with 10% ethanol, the latter has just over 96% BTU value of pure gasoline. Gasoline BTU varies relating to the Reid vapor pressure (causing easier vaporization in winter blends containing ethanol (ethanol is difficult to start a vehicle on when it is cold out) and anti-knock additives. Such additives offer a reduction in BTU value.\n\nA concept closely related to the BTU or kWh potential of a given fuel is engine efficiency, often called thermal efficiency in the case of internal combustion engines.\n\nGenerally speaking, an electrical motor is far more efficient than an internal combustion engine at converting potential energy into work - turning the wheels that may move a car down the road, as there is minimal waste heat coming off the motor parts, and zero heat cast off by the coolant radiator and out of the exhaust.\n\nA diesel cycle engine can be as much as 40% to 50% efficient at converting fuel into work, where a typical automotive gasoline engine's efficiency is about 25% to 30%.\n\nThe efficiency of converting a unit of fuel to rotation of the driving wheels includes many points of friction loss and heat loss through the exhaust or cooling system. Friction inside the engine happens along the cylinder walls, crankshaft rod bearings and main bearings, camshaft bearings, drive chains or gears, plus other miscellaneous and minor bearing surfaces. An electric motor has internal friction only at the main axle bearings. Friction outside the motor/engine includes loads from the generator / alternator, power steering pump, A/C compressor, transmission, transfer case (if four-wheel-drive), differential(s) and universal joints, plus rolling resistance of the pneumatic tires.\n\nThe MPG of a given vehicle starts with the thermal efficiency of the fuel and engine, less all of the above elements of friction.\n\nThe MPGe metric was introduced in November 2010 by EPA in the Monroney label of the Nissan Leaf electric car and the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid. The ratings are based on EPA's formula, in which 33.7 kilowatt hours of electricity is equivalent to one gallon of gasoline, and the energy consumption of each vehicle during simulating varying driving conditions. All new cars and light-duty trucks sold in the U.S. are required to have this label showing the EPA's estimate of fuel economy of the vehicle.\n\n"}

Typically, these individuals are defined as holding financial assets (excluding their primary residence) with a value greater than US$1 million.\n\n\"Very-HNWI\" (VHNWI) can refer to someone with a net worth of at least US$5 million.\n\nThe Capgemini and Merrill Lynch World Wealth Report 2006 defines an additional class of ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs), those with US$30 million in liquid financial assets or with a disposable income of more than US$20 million.\n\nAt the end of 2018, there were estimated to be just over 14 million HNWIs in the world. The United States had the highest number of HNWIs (4,900,000) of any country, while New York City had the most HNWIs (377,000) among cities.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires all SEC-registered investment advisers to periodically file a report known as Form ADV. Among other things, Form ADV requires each investment adviser to state how many of their clients are \"high-net-worth individuals\". The Form ADV Glossary of Terms explains that a \"high-net-worth individual\" is an individual with at least $1,000,000 managed by the reporting investment adviser, or whose net worth the investment adviser reasonably believes exceeds $2,000,000 (or who is a \"qualified purchaser\" as defined in section 2(a)(51)(A) of the Investment Company Act of 1940). The net worth of an individual for SEC purposes may include assets held jointly with his or her spouse. Unlike the definitions used in the financial and banking trade, the SEC's definition of HNWI would include the value of a person's verifiable non-financial assets, such as a primary residence or art collection.\n\nThe World Wealth Report was co-published by Merrill Lynch and Capgemini, previously known as Cap Gemini Ernst & Young who worked together since c. 1993, investigating the \"needs of high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs are individuals with more than $1 million in assets excluding primary residence)\" in order to \"successfully serve this market segment\". Their first annual World Wealth Report was published in 1996. The World’s Wealth Report defines HNWIs as those who hold at least US$1 million in assets excluding primary residence and ultra-HNWIs as those who hold at least US$30 million in assets excluding primary residence. The report states that in 2008 there were 8.6 million HNWIs worldwide, a decline of 14.9% from 2007. The total HNWI wealth worldwide totaled US$32.8 trillion, a 19.5% decrease from 2007. The ultra-HNWIs experienced the greater loss, losing 24.6% in population size and 23.9% in accumulated wealth. The report revised its 2007 projections that HNWI financial wealth would reach US$59.1 trillion by 2012 and revised this downward to a 2013 HNWI wealth valued at $48.5 trillion advancing at an annual rate of 8.1%.\n\nThe 2013 World Wealth Report was jointly produced by Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management and included, for the first time, the Global HNW Insights Survey produced in collaboration with Scorpio Partnership. The inaugural survey represented one of the largest and most in-depth surveys of high-net-worth individuals ever conducted, surveying more than 4,400 HNWIs across 21 major wealth markets in North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Africa. \nThe World Wealth Report published Capgemini has estimated the number and combined investable wealth of high-net-worth individuals as follows, using the United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) Inflation Calculator.\n\nCertain products cater to the wealthy, whose conspicuous consumption of luxury goods and services includes, for example: mansions, yachts, first-class airline tickets and private jets, and personal umbrella insurance. As economic growth has made historically expensive items affordable for the middle-class, purchases have trended towards intangible products such as education. In the United States, concierge medicine is an emerging trend as of 2017.\n\nMost global banks, such as Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citibank, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, and UBS, have a separate business unit with designated teams consisting of client advisors and product specialists exclusively for UHNWI. Because of their extreme high net worth and the way their assets were generated, these clients are often considered to have characteristics similar to institutional investors.\n\nBy 2006, asset managers working for HNW individuals invested more than £300 billion on behalf of their clients. These wealth managers are bankers who in 2006, earned multimillion-pound salaries and owned their own companies and equity funds. In 2006, a list of the 50 top investment bankers was published by the Spear's Wealth Management Survey.\n\nCertain magazines, such as \"Monocle\",\n\"Robb Report\", and \"Worth\", are designed for a high net worth audience.\n\nBrands in various sectors, such as Bentley, Maybach, and Rolls-Royce in motoring, actively target UHNWI and HNWI to sell their products. In 2006, Rolls-Royce researchers suggested there were 80,000 people in ultra-high-net-worth category around the world. UHNW individuals \"have, on average, eight cars and three or four homes. Three-quarters own a jet aircraft and most have a yacht.\"\n\nThe following is a list of the cities with the most HNWIs as of December 2018 as per the 2019 Global Wealth Migration Review. \nThe following table shows the countries with the highest net inflow of HNWIs in 2018 and 2017 according to an annual report conducted by AfrAsia Bank in partnership with New World Wealth. The report excludes the war-torn countries of Syria, Libya and Iraq because data from those countries is unreliable.\n\nThe following table shows the countries with the highest net outflow of HNWIs in 2017.\n\nThe Wharton Global Family Alliance (WGFA) whitepaper was released in 2008 to study the investment strategies of single family offices in the United States and in Europe. The research was segregated into sub-groups representing those with less than $1 billion in assets and those with assets above $1 billion. The study found that U.S. families reported a more aggressive attitude toward investment objectives than their counterparts in Europe. One recommendation of the WGFA study advised the advisors and family offices serving this niche to avoid complexity in the structure of portfolios.\n\nThe authors cite that the more complex the portfolio and number of holdings, the more difficult the job of performing adequate governance, reporting, and education. The Institute for Private Investors, a peer networking organization for wealthy families and their advisors, suggested a similar theme to its membership in 2008 with a conference themed, \"The Return to Simplicity\". Kotak Wealth Management and CRISIL Research, published a report on the Ultra High Net Worth Individuals in India titled \"Top of the Pyramid Report\".\n\nNiall J Gannon and Michael Blum published a whitepaper in The Journal of Wealth Management in 2006 titled The After-Tax Return of Stocks Versus Bonds for the High Tax Bracket Investor. The paper found that the return of indexed stock portfolios fell from 10.62% for non-taxable portfolios to 6.72% for a portfolio that paid the highest federal income and capital gains tax rate. The paper observed rolling 20 year periods from 1961-2006. The study was updated by Gannon and Scott Seibert, CFA in \"Tailored Wealth Management: Exploring the Cause and Effect of Financial Success\".

Within the Turkish education system, the only way to enter a university is through this exam. 1,692,000 high school graduates took the exam in 2011 and 2,255,386 in 2016. It is a multiple choice exam (5 options). It has two parts as Core Proficiency Test-Advanced Proficiency Test (, TYT-AYT).\n\nÖSS was first applied in the late 1960s. Before then each university selected their students via their own criteria. However, with the increasing number of youth and the overloaded applications, the universities gathered and founded \"Yüksekögretim Kurulu\", the Higher Education Council, and a subdivision named ÖSYM, \"Student Selection and Placement Center\", which began to operate the central ÖSS, Student Selection Examination.\n\nIn 1980 the number of the exams were increased to two, namely the ÖSS and ÖYS. If a student did not achieve the specified grade in ÖSS, they did not have the right to enter ÖYS, and thus, lost their chance to be accepted to a university. ÖSS consisted of questions about the ninth grade curriculum, and ÖYS was a test on the tenth and eleventh grade curriculum. ÖSS eliminated the students on the basis of the grade they had received in the exam, and ÖYS placed the students to the universities they wanted. This system continued until 1999 when ÖYS was dropped and the system reverted to the single ÖSS exam, with the same format and same questions.\n\nThe ÖSS exam was a 180-minute exam with 180 questions testing students' analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities, as well as knowledge of the high school curriculum. Each student was expected to answer the entirety of questions, which spanned the following subject areas: mathematics, geometry, physics, chemistry, biology, Turkish language, history, geography and philosophy.\n\nA foreign language exam, the YDS, was conducted a week after the ÖSS. It was composed of foreign language questions in English, French, and German. As in ÖSS, each student solved the questions of the foreign language department they had chosen at high school.\n\nThe maximum score that a student could attain on the ÖSS was 380,300 being the student's achievement on the test score, and 80 being a student's high school score based on their GPA, graduation rank, and school's past success on the ÖSS exam.\n\nIf a student selected a university department related to their studies at high school (namely applied sciences, social sciences, or foreign languages), their score was multiplied by 0.8. If a student preferred to study at a different department from their high school concentration, their score was multiplied by 0.3.\n\nStudents who took ÖSS in 2006 saw some major changes. The exam now lasted 195 minutes, and had two parts: ÖSS 1 and ÖSS 2. ÖSS 1 has 120 questions on the ninth and tenth grade curriculum. There are 30 Turkish, 30 Math 1, 30 Science 1, 30 Social Sciences 1 questions. Each student has to answer every question regardless of his/her department.\n\nÖSS 2 is composed of 120 questions out of which students have to answer 60. Students at the social sciences department have to answer the social sciences-2 and literature-social test questions. Students at the applied sciences departments have to answer the applied sciences-2 and mathematics-2 questions. The students at the foreign languages departments have to answer the whole ÖSS 1 and foreign language questions; which are tested separately in another exam named YDS-foreign language exam. The Turkish-Math students must answer the literature-social and mathematics-2 questions.\n\nBeginning in 2010, the exam is now similar to the ÖSS-ÖYS system in terms of topics. Students take the Transition to Higher Education Examination (YGS) in March. Those who pass the YGS are then entitled to take the Undergraduate Placement Examination (LYS), the second-round exam in the new system taking place in June. Students who only take the YGS, in which students have to answer 160 questions (Turkish language (40), maths (40), philosophy (8), geography (12), history (15), religion culture and morality knowledge (5), biology (13), physics (14) and chemistry (13)) in 160 minutes, are able to apply for associate degree programs. There are five LYS sessions whereas the previous university entrance system, the ÖSS, was held once in a year throughout the country.\n\nThe Higher Education Institutions Examination (YKS) is conducted by the Measurement, Selection and Placement Center ÖSYM in order to enable the students to be placed in higher education programs and to be placed according to their preferences.\n\nHigher Education Institutions Exam (YKS):\n\nYKS is a 3-session exam. All applicants applying to YKS are required to attend the Basic Proficiency Test (TYT). Other sessions are optional.\n\nThe first session is the Basic Proficiency Test (TYT).  The test  is carried out in the following fields.\n\n-Turkish language (40 questions)\n\n-Liberal arts (25 questions)\n\n-Mathematics (40 questions)\n\n-Science (20 questions)\n\nIn the 2nd Field Qualification Tests (AYT), the candidates are asked the following four areas:\n\n-Turkish Language and Literature and Social Sciences I Test (Turkish Language and Literature, History I and Geography I)\n\n-Social Sciences II Test (History II, Geography II, Philosophy Group)\n\n-Mathematical Test\n\n-Fen Science Test\n\nThe third session is the Foreign Language Test (English) (YDT).\n\nCandidates with a score of 150 or higher in the TYT will be able to choose higher education programs that take students with TYT points. Candidates who scored 150 or more in TYT, say, SAY, ORAL, EA, DIL scores of 180 and above, with these point types and students with undergraduate degree programs with TYT score will be able to choose the undergraduate programs.\n\nCandidates who have a score of 180 or more in TYT have the right to choose only associate degree programs. These candidates do not have the right to choose undergraduate, undergraduate and graduate programs with SAY (Maths and Science), VERBAL ( Turkish, Social Sciences (history II, geography II and religion/philosophy II) , EA (Maths, Turkish and History I and Geography I) and LANGUAGE (English, French, German, Russian and Arabic) score.\n\nIn order to apply for higher education programs that take students with a special aptitude test, TYT score should be min. 180 and above (for disabled students 100 and above)\nResults are announced in the second half of June and students have to make their university preferences by the last week of July. They are placed in courses according to their scores and this is announced at the end of August. In Turkish educational system, schools follow a curriculum completely decided by the state, which makes it easier to hold nationwide exams \n\n\"Life = 180 minutes?\" is a slogan used by TED (Turkish Education Association) in 2005 in order to criticize the ÖSS system for attempting to encompass all the work of a student throughout his or her 12 years of academic life in a 3-hour multiple choice exam. This is arguably unfair; however, the president of the ÖSYM exam board states that \"ÖSS is the only available university entrance system until the number of people who apply to universities is lowered.\"\n\nThe most significant reason why ÖSS is being conducted instead of personal interviews is the fact that the total capacity of universities is 450,000 while the number of candidates wanting to study at a college is 1.6 million and is increasing every year.\n\nFor a student, the education they receive at school is seen as not enough to succeed in ÖSS. Therefore, there is a huge sector in Turkey of private evening and weekend cram schools (\"dershane\") all around the country. These institutions prepare students solely for exams, including university entrance. All \"dershane\"s compete with each other in order to create the \"champion\", the one to score the highest mark in Turkey. The dershane sector is bolstered every year by huge media interest as the results of the exam are disclosed and the students who rank in the top few appear on TV and in the newspapers. In 2011 ÖSYM is taking steps to limit this interest by charging newspapers 150,000 TL for the past exam questions, while forbidding television channels other than the state-owned TRT from broadcasting the questions.\n\n\n\n"}

In that year, they had their hit single, \"Dreams are Ten a Penny\", but the band itself did not exist at the time. The song was written by John Carter and his wife Gill. Carter also sang all the vocals and played the guitar on the record. The song was released by the British record producer on the Penny Farthing Records label. Although the record was unsuccessful in the UK, it reached the #2 in Germany, spent six months on the charts there, and sold a million copies.\n\n\"Dreams Are Ten a Penny\" eventually got on the charts in Australia, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, and South Africa. In order to promote the hit, Penny Farthing Records recruited John Knowles as the frontman for Kincade since Carter was reluctant to tour as the performing artist. Knowles was successful as the frontman for Kincade and went on to change his name to John Kincade. Consequently, Larry Page launched John Kincade as a solo artist, which resulted in several hit songs on the German charts from 1973 to 1975.\n\nIn December 1972, Paul Griggs had a call from Larry Page to form a touring band for Kincade, and Griggs recruited his brother Nigel and Rick Williams. A month later, they made a promotional trip to Spain, performing on a couple of television programmes, undertaking press interviews and making several personal appearances. \n\nBy this time another single, \"Do You Remember Marilyn\", and a Kincade album had been released. They had been recorded by Carter using session musicians. The assembled group continued promoting material for the rest of 1973, making several visits to Germany. Their last appearance as Kincade was on the German TV show, \"Disco 73\" in December 1973, with a song called \"Big Hand For Annie\". This song failed to chart and eventually the three musicians never had to go on stage as Kincade again. Future releases of Kincade would be without pictures of musicians.\n\n"}

The school is located in the Sydney suburb of Engadine, New South Wales and is run by the Roman Catholic Salesians, a religious order of priests, in conjunction with specialist teachers and social workers.\n\nBoys' Town Engadine – Dunlea Centre provides a voluntary service for families at risk of family breakdown, who are committed to improving their relationships. Boys' Town Engadine – Dunlea Centre provides intensive life skills, therapeutic and educational services in an out of home care setting.\n\nA parish priest of Sutherland Shire, in 1934 Thomas Dunlea was requested by a dying woman to look after her son. After the woman's death, Dunlea took the boy to the parish presbytery. Over the ensuing years, a number of young boys were entrusted to his care during the Great Depression. The boys were moved to a bigger house, but after Sutherland Shire Council forced them onto the road, they set up tents in nearby Royal National Park. On 1 August 1939, Dunlea officially opened the school with seven boys in his care. The purpose of the school was to help disadvantaged young males. His inspiration was the 1938 movie \"Boystown\", about Edward J. Flanagan, who founded the original Boystown in Nebraska, USA.\n\nPublicity led to a gift of at Engadine, where Boys' Town started in August 1940. It was to be partly self-supporting and to be run by the boys themselves—with the priest's oversight. In 1942, at Archbishop Cardinal Sir Norman Gilroy's request, the De La Salle Brothers came to Boys' Town. Dunlea resigned his parish, and moved to the United States in 1947, returning to Australia in the late 1940s where he became to accept that he was an alcoholic.\n\nDunlea described the school as:\n\"Boys’ Town is for homeless and friendless boys—it is the hometown; the fair-dinkum town; the town of charity, unity and kindness; it is a smooth landing ground.\"\n\nIn 1978 there was a total of 135 students (mostly 'boarders', with a small percentage of 'day' students) at Boys' Town.

As the school is unzoned, it attracts students from all across the Adelaide metropolitan area as well as some regional and interstate locations, in addition to international students. The goal of the school is to prepare its students for university, particularly in the fields of mathematics and science. The ASMS is unconventional in its approach to education, emphasising a love of learning in both students and teaching staff; students are given the freedom to take control of their own education. ASMS aims to make students aware of their own learning and for them to become self-directed in the way they complete academic tasks.\n\nThe Australian Science and Mathematics School was opened in 2004 and has a total of around 380 students. As the school is designed to provide an adult environment for senior school students, there is no school uniform policy, which promotes a variety of culture and social styles and structures. A key feature of the ASMS is the productive relationship between the school and the Flinders University, on which the campus is located; the ASMS shares many resources with the university, including the library, cafeteria, student services, transport, recreational areas and car parks, in addition to booked access to lecture theatres and specialist science and support facilities. Furthermore, students at the ASMS in collaboration with Flinders University's Science and Technology Enterprise Partnership (STEP) may be involved in research projects in the business, industry and university sectors.\n\nThe ASMS is a specialist science and mathematics school, however it offers a comprehensive curriculum which covers all learning areas necessary for students to achieve their South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE) qualification. \nThe Year 10/11 curriculum is organised into interdisciplinary Central Studies; these alternate every year to ensure that a student will not do the same subjects twice. The Year 12 curriculum consists of standard SACE Stage 2 subjects, such as the various Mathematics, Science, English and Humanities subjects.\n\nThe ASMS also provides special activities for Year 10 and 11 students in the form of Adventure Space. Examples of these include Dance, Cryptography, Robotics, Aviation, Australian Space Design Competition, Paramedical Pathways, Electronics, Creative Writing, and Palaeontology. While not assessed, they do provide an opportunity to interact with university life, as well as an opportunity to take part in learning focused productive extra-curricular activities.\n\n"}
{"id": "2224748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224748", "title": "Mine-a", "text": "Mine-a\n\nMine-a (Enchanta: ᜋᜒᜈᜒ-ᜀ, snow) is a character from the Filipino \"telefantasya\" saga \"Encantadia\" produced by GMA Network. Also known as \"Ynang Reyna\", Mine-a is a queen of the Diwata kingdom of Lireo, and the mother of main characters Amihan, Pirena, Alena and Danaya.\n\nMine-a has been played by several Filipina actresses. Dawn Zulueta played Mine-a in the first \"Encantadia\" series. Nadine Samonte, on the other hand, played the young Mine-a in the \"Etheria\" series. However, the \"Ynang Reyna\" character was originally played by Giselle Toengi in \"Mulawin\", the series from which \"Encantadia\" spin-off. On the 2016 requel of the series, Encantadia, Marian Rivera takes on the role of the Ynang Reyna. In Etheria 2017, young Mine-a will be played by Kim Domingo in which she was still a Heran.\n\nNamed after the word for snow in Enchanta (the Encantadia language). Long ago, in the earlier days of Etheria, there was a diwata named Esmeralda, who had powers in whatever words she lets go from her mouth. Once, a couple of Etherians tried stealing her sceptre but they did not succeed. Instead, Esmeralda had bestowed unto them and the whole of Etheria, a curse that one of her race would be the one to bring Etheria into nothing but ashes, leaving memories of their kingdom being a dreadful one. This threatens the kingdom and begins to turn diwatas into their slaves, keeping an eye on every diwata being born and killing whoever does even just a small heroic work. All these were done to prevent the threatening prophecy from happening.\n\nThey became even more horrified when the papers indicating every prophecy mentioned that there would be a diwata who would someday be a powerful queen- Mine-a. She was then adopted by Etherian Queen Avria, the latter being barren. This was done so that Mine-a would be the future queen of Etheria rather than being the queen of the diwatas, who would be the one to fulfill Esmeralda's curse. She grew up recognizing Avria and Memen as her real parents, and that she is a true Etherian. Little does she know that the diwatas that she loathes the most is her race. Avria, upon the goading of Barkus, killed Mine-a's real mother and raised Mine-a as her daughter.\n\nBefore the Sanggres changed history, the young Mine-a was angry at the betrayal of her father. Although she appeared the dutiful daughter who is engaged to Prince Hagorn of Hathoria, Mine-a led a double life. She enchanted the Kabilan to become a weapon to destroy the Diwatas, then disguised as a lowly diwata servant (Queshya) she hunts for her father and his mistress in order to kill them. It was during one of these forays that she would meet Prince Raquim, who would know her as Queshya. After learning that she has Diwata blood in her like her father, Mine-a realized that what she is doing is wrong and desired to vindicate herself for what she has done.\n\nAfter Cassiopea left Lireo (she was banished because she separated the brillante into four pieces), the throne of Lireo was entrusted to Queen Ursula after which was succeeded by Queen Demetria. Their reigns were short because of the Hathorian disease that swept the diwatas and claimed their lives. Evades came to Mine-a and told her that she was to become the next queen. She asks Evades why and he answers because it is her destiny and with the mark on her back to signify that she will reign in Lireo longer than any of its past rulers.\n\nAs queen of Lireo, Mine-a was the keeper of the Jewel of Air and the magical scepter (this will later be claimed by Hagorn during an invasion of Lireo) and mother to the four elemental goddesses who will later carry the magic that the four jewels bear.\n\nWhen Hathoria invaded Adamya, which was aided by Sapiro, the three jewels kept by the three kingdoms fell to Prince Raquim of Sapiro's possession. With Adamya defeated and Sapiro the next target of Hathoria, Raquim brought the jewels to Lireo. This was how all four elemental jewels came to be guarded by the diwatas.\n\nMine-a had four daughters, each one (except Alena & Danaya) having a different father. Pirena is her daughter with Hagorn, King of Hathoria. They were once betrothed when Etheria was still standing, but the two later became enemies. Amihan is her daughter with Raquim, Prince of Sapiro and her beloved. However, both Raquim and Amihan were parted from Mine-a when Raquim decided to leave Encantadia and live in the world of mortals, taking his daughter with him. Alena and Danaya were the only sisters who shared the same father, Enuo, who was killed while fighting the Hathors. These two daughters were born not out of love but out of destiny. Since Enuo was so good and kind, he was entrusted to be the father of both Alena and Danaya. With the exception of Amihan, who grew up with her father, Mine-a's daughters never met, or even knew the identity of their fathers. When Hagorn crossed the portal into the mortal world to find and kill Raquim, the young Amihan was found by the queen's guards and reunited with her mother.\n\nWhen her children had grown into lovely young women, Mine-a learned that she would soon die and leave for Devas. To determine the successor to the throne, she consulted her advisors and then told her daughters to prepare for a test. During one of Mine-a's discussions with Imaw, Pirena overheard her mother wish that any of her three younger daughters, and not Pirena, would become queen. Mine-a mentioned something about Pirena's \"blood\" (but did not expound on the subject, which mystified even the wise Imaw) and that she is sorry that Pirena would not be able to fulfill her ambition. By then Pirena had already gone, angry and hurt with questions on her mind.\n\nThe test for the sisters turned out to be fighting with a cloaked warrior. The goal is to take the \"key\" that the warrior possessed. The warrior wore a white cloak with a brown face covering (intriguingly, the attire of a common Sapirian warrior) and wore a key pendant around its neck.\n\nDanaya went first and it was her battle that was most difficult (she even stepped on traps). Defeated, she went home sulking. Alena went next and also succumbed to defeat the warrior but she was just happy about it (to everyone's puzzlement). Next went Amihan. When she proved to be strong, Pirena joined in and together they fought in forcing the warrior to retreat to the woods. In their pursuit, Amihan fell off a cliff. Pirena then tried to save her sister but remembered that Amihan was also her rival, thus, she kicked Amihan's hand, letting her fall down. The cloaked warrior flew down, rescuing the diwata. It was at this moment that Amihan recognized the warrior as her mother. Mine-a uncovered her face and told Amihan that she just found the key: a child should know that her mother's love would always show through, despite any sort of disguise.\n\nBack on the cliff, Mine-a announced Amihan as the winner. This news was not received well by Pirena, who challenged her mother to another duel. Mine-a would rather not duel with her daughter but was forced to accept the challenge in accordance to the rules of Lireo.\n\nPirena was surprisingly stronger and faster during the second duel, almost defeating Mine-a if not for the intervention of Mine-a's other daughters. The intervention enraged Pirena, who left Lireo to join forces with its enemy, Hathoria.\n\nThe diwatas soon realized the source of Pirena's new strength when they discovered that the jewel of fire was missing. The theft showed that it is not enough to put the jewels in a guarded room. Mine-a decided that each of her three remaining daughters should guard one of the remaining jewels. Thus Amihan, who succeeded as queen, came to be the guardian of the air jewel, the water jewel was given to Alena, and the protection of the earth jewel was given to Danaya.\n\nBefore her death, she left her will and given to her oldest Pirena's as the Queen of Lireo, if her sister Amihan killed her father, she could be successor to her sister.\n\nMine-a died in Lireo just before Lira (Milagros) was born, She was believed to be at least 3,000 years old when she died. Thereafter she resided in the peace of Devas. She reappeared later in the Encantadia series when Lira came to Devas for advice. She told Lira that the only way Encantadia will be united is the unification of her four daughters, who have gone astray by Bathala's will, and Lira is the key for this to happen. Lira had been identified by Cassiopea as \"luntaie\", the saviour. Mine-a is also the reason why Kahlil wanted to go back to Devas when he was resurrected by Alipato, Pirena's spirit guide.\n\nMinea is one of the most powerful diwatas of Encantadia she possess many powers:\n\n\nMinea also possesses a variety of unspecified powers\n"}

Despite the revolutionary character of the new retail system, by the end of the 1950s Ruben Rausing and the Tetra Pak management team realised that the Tetra Pak package portfolio needed to be supplemented by an additional rectangular model to continue to be competitive. Large amounts were spent on development, and in 1963 the first Tetra Brik packaging machine was installed in Motala in central Sweden. Due to its effective use of space and materials and the increased efficiency in distribution and storage that resulted from the rectangular shape, the Tetra Brik soon became Tetra Pak's best seller in Sweden and internationally and paved the way for Tetra Pak's enormous success during the 1970s and onwards.\n\nThe Tetra Brik Aseptic came onto the market in 1969 and soon became Tetra Pak's flagship package.

{"id": "2224761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224761", "title": "Louis W. Ballard", "text": "Louis W. Ballard\n\nLouis W. Ballard (July 8, 1931 – February 9, 2007) was a Native American composer, educator, author, artist, and journalist.\n\nLouis Wayne Ballard was born on July 8, 1931, in Devil's Promenade near Miami, Oklahoma. He was Quapaw and Cherokee. On his mother's side, he was related to a prominent medicine chief of the Quapaw Tribe, and on his father's side he was related to a principal chief of the Cherokee Nation. His Quapaw name, Honganozhe, translates to \"One Who Stands With Eagles.\"\n\nBallard's education began at the Seneca Indian Training School when he was six years old. The Seneca Indian Training School, a boarding school located in Wyandotte, Oklahoma, was established in the early 1870s and was initially a mission school supported by a local group of Quakers and government subsidies. Over time, the school came under control of the government. The mission of the Seneca Indian Training School and other institutions like it can be best explained by the following message delivered by Thomas J. Morgan, the former Commissioner of Indian Affairs, in 1889: \"[American Indian children] should be taught to look upon America as their home and upon the United States Government as their friend and benefactor. They should be made familiar with the lives of great and good men and women in American history, and be taught to feel a pride in all their great achievements. They should hear little or nothing of the 'wrongs of the Indians,' and of the injustice of the white race. If their unhappy history is alluded to, it should be to contrast it with the better future that is within their grasp.\"\n\nBallard considered these schools to be institutions that would brainwash American Indian children. Despite the efforts of the Seneca Indian Training School in discouraging him from practicing his family's customs, Ballard continued to speak in his native language and engage in tribal dances; he was constantly persecuted for doing so. This was not unlike the treatment that his mother received at a school similar to the Seneca Indian Training School where on occasion, she was beaten, handcuffed, and submitted to solitary confinement when she was caught speaking Quapaw. These disciplinary tactics were commonplace at such institutions throughout the United States and resulted in a dramatic loss of language and culture.\n\nAfter leaving boarding school, Ballard's parents divorced, and he and his brother, Charles Ballard, lived with their mother and step-father for part of the year, and with their grandmother for the other part of the year. During this period of his life, Ballard struggled with his identity. With his mother, he lived what could have been described as a typical American life-style with little spiritual or cultural guidance. In school, he was often forced to draw tom-toms and tomahawks by the teacher, and the other students would often taunt, harass, and throw stones at him. While living with his grandmother, though, he attended Baptist Mission School and took part in powwows as well as other community festivals. It is not surprising that he felt more comfortable living with his grandmother. There seems to be some speculation as to who first taught the young Louis Ballard to play piano at the Baptist Mission Church. One source states that it was his mother who first taught him, but another source claims that his grandmother paid an unnamed private tutor to instruct him. According to the latter, his grandmother's property contained zinc and lead, and as a result, had the financial means to purchase a piano as well as pay for piano and voice lessons. By the time he had finished high school, he had a number of achievements to his name. He was the captain of both the football team and the baseball team, he was named valedictorian and outstanding graduate of the class of 1949, and he performed in a piano recital that took place at the University of Oklahoma. Although Ballard was trained in the style of Western music, he was deeply rooted in the music and dance traditions of his culture. As a child, he often participated in powwows, and he would continue to participate in powwows into his years as a young adult. He eventually became a member of the War Dance Society of the Quapaw tribe.\n\nAfter high school, Ballard continued to pursue music while at college. He began studying at the University of Oklahoma in 1949, and then transferred to Northeastern Oklahoma A&M in 1951. In 1954 he received a bachelor's degree in music theory and a bachelor's degree in music education at the University of Tulsa. There, he studied piano with Stefan Bardos and composition with Bela Rosza. Ballard met his first wife, Delores Lookout, on a blind date at the University of Tulsa in 1953. They were, then, married in January of the following year in Pawhuska, Oklahoma. Their first son, Louis Anthony Ballard, was born on October 30, 1954. Louis had two additional children with Delores. Their daughter, Anne Marie Quetone, was born on March 7, 1956, and their second son, Charles Christopher Ballard, was born August 10, 1957. During his undergraduate studies, Ballard began exploring ways in which he could combine his passion for his Quapaw music traditions with Western music practices. Taking inspiration from Bela Bartok's use of Hungarian folk themes, one of Ballard's first attempts at unifying these two musical practices was a compositional exercise in which he arranged a Ponca Indian melody in the styles of both Chopin and Rachmaninoff. Ultimately, he was dissatisfied with the outcome because he wanted his American Indian-influenced music to be assessed for its own unique qualities. He felt that for it to be truly original, it needed to feature American Indian music traditions without being in the style of another composer. He would later explain, \"Dvorak, in 1893, predicted that America should have a form of nationalistic music built upon Indian music and Black slave songs. So I felt that I was in good company when I took up my pen to express the sufferings of my people, their regeneration and hopes for a better future life…\" While Ballard was pursuing his undergraduate degrees, he sang with the Tulsa University Radio Choir in order to support himself.\n\nAfter graduating, Ballard taught music at various schools throughout Oklahoma, including Marquette High School in Tulsa and Nelagoney Consolidated Schools in Osage. He was also the music director for Memorial Baptist Church and Madelene Catholic Church in Tulsa, and First Presbyterian Church in Pawhuska. Later, Ballard ultimately left his music director positions and supported himself by teaching private piano lessons. Louis Ballard returned to the University of Tulsa to pursue a master's degree in composition in 1960, and continued his studies with Bela Rosza. He graduated in 1962, and was distinguished by being the first American Indian to receive a graduate degree in music composition.\n\nAfter graduating, Ballard frequently attended the Aspen Music Festival and studied composition privately with notable musical figures such as Darius Milhaud, Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, Carlos Surinach, and Felix Labunski. He also studied applied percussion with George Gaber. During the summer, as a faculty member at the Aspen Music Festival from 1957 through 1972, he taught private lessons in percussion performance and participated in various concerts held during the festival. Louis Ballard met his second wife, Ruth Doré at the Aspen Music Festival in 1963. She too was a concert pianist, and would later become Ballard's manager and publicist. At this time, both Louis Ballard's marriage to Delores Lookout and Ruth Doré's marriage to her husband, Robert Sands, were rapidly deteriorating. By 1965, Louis Ballard divorced Delores Lookout, and was soon remarried to Ruth Doré. Doré came from a family with wealth, and with her personal and financial support, Ballard was able to pursue composition on a full-time basis. In addition to spending his summers at the Aspen Music Festival, Ballard also served as the music director for the Institute of American Indian Arts based in Santa Fe, New Mexico, from 1962 to 1968.\n\nIn 1966, the Ballard family hired Lydia Talache as a housekeeper and babysitter for their three children. While she worked for them, Lydia became very close to the family. She frequented the Ballard residence twice a week until 1970. According to Lydia Talache, Louis Ballard was well liked in the American Indian community, and his music was very well received by the community at large. She recounted that the vast majority of Pueblo people favored the music that Ballard had composed and were enthusiastic about Ballard's depiction of American Indian culture in his music. Ballard was also respected as a musician and composer among the non-American Indian music community in Santa Fe. Michael Udow, the principal percussionist of the Santa Fe Opera orchestra from 1968 until his retirement in 2009, personally attested to the respect that Ballard garnered among the other musicians and by the local community in general.\n\nFrom 1968 until 1979, Ballard was appointed as the National Curriculum Specialist for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. During this time, he worked with over three hundred and fifty schools nationwide, and was exposed to the cultures and musical traditions of many different tribes. During his time with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, he made one of his most valuable contributions as a music educator and champion of American Indian music and culture. In 1973, Ballard wrote and published American Indian Music for the Classroom, a curriculum complete with recordings for teachers who wanted to incorporate American Indian music in classroom instruction. Throughout his career, Louis Ballard composed a large number of musical works for a variety of different instruments and ensembles. Many of Ballard's works have been premiered at major venues and have garnered awards and accolades nationally and internationally.\n\n\"Scenes from Indian Life\" was originally a three movement orchestral work which premiered in Rochester, New York, and was conducted by Howard Hanson in 1964. The same piece with an added a fourth movement, \"Feast Day,\" was performed by the San Jose Symphony as a part of its \"Voices of America\" program in 1994 along with Aaron Copland's \"Lincoln Portrait\" and Leonard Bernstein's Symphony no. 2, \"The Age of Anxiety.\" In 1969, Ballard's Ritmo Indio, a three movement work for woodwind quintet, won the first Marion Nevins McDowell Award for American Chamber Music, and was featured as the opening work at the Gala Quintet of the Americas concert, \"Discovering the New World: A Quincentennial Event,\" at Carnegie Hall on January 9, 1992. The first movement of Ritmo Indio, \"The Soul,\" was also recorded on two of the Quintet of the Americas' albums: Souvenirs, and Discovering the New World. Ballard began experimenting with other mediums and ventured outside the chamber ensemble format when he composed two works for ballet. The Four Moons, written in honor and celebration of Oklahoma's sixtieth year of statehood in 1967, was performed both in Tulsa and in Oklahoma City. It was also featured at the Tulsa Ballet's New York debut performance in 1983. His second ballet, Desert Trilogy, was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 1971. Another popular and critically acclaimed composition is his chamber orchestral work, Incident at Wounded Knee. Incident at Wounded Knee was inspired by a stream of daily newspaper reports that were covering the court proceedings related to the 1973 conflict that occurred between the FBI and members of the American Indian Movement on the Sioux reservation in Pine Ridge, South Dakota. This was also the site of a massacre of three hundred Oglala Sioux by the United States military in 1890. Commissioned and conducted by Dennis Russell Davies, the director of the St. Paul Chamber Symphony Orchestra in 1974, it was performed in New York at Carnegie Hall in 1999 at the American Composer's Orchestra's opening concert of the season, \"Protest.\" While Incident at Wounded Knee is not a programmatic work, it represents the customs and emotions of the American Indian peoples. In 1976, Portrait of Will Rogers, Ballard's choral cantata, was premiered by the Kansas City Symphony with Will Rogers, Jr. as the narrator.\n\nBallard's works have also been premiered at prestigious venues such as the Lincoln Center, the Kennedy Center, and the Smithsonian Institution. In 1999, he was the first American composer to have a complete concert dedicated to his music at Beethovenhalle in Bonn, Germany, and he was featured as a guest artist, in 2000, at the Salzburg Mozarteum. In 2004, Louis Ballard was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame making it the first time that a symphonic composer was inducted in tandem with pop music artists. His music has been featured on radio networks around the world including National Public Radio, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, British Broadcasting Corporation, Radio France, Deutsche Welle, and Saarländischer Rundfunk. Ballard, himself, has been awarded with two honorary doctoral degrees, one from the College of Santa Fe, and the other from William Jewel College, and he has received the National Indian Achievement Award four times. In addition, he was awarded with several more awards in honor of his contributions which include: the Distinguished Service Award from the U.S. Central Office of Education, a citation in the U.S. Congressional Record, a Lifetime Musical Achievement Award by the First Americans in the Arts, and the Cherokee Medal of Honor. He was also awarded with several grants that allowed him to continue his work. In addition to a Rockefeller Foundation Grant in 1969, and a Ford Foundation Grant a year later, he has received a total of five grants from the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nIn the years following 1990, Ruth Ballard was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and her mental health was declining. As a result, she had to relinquish her responsibilities as Louis Ballard's manager and publicist. In 2001, Ruth was institutionalized due to her progressing condition remaining under the guardianship of Louis W. Ballard. While working on a newly commissioned piano concerto, Louis W. Ballard died at the age of seventy-five on February 9, 2007, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, after a five-year-struggle against cancer. His body was cremated, and his ashes were placed on his mother's grave in Miami, Oklahoma. After Louis W. Ballard's death, guardianship of Ruth Ballard went to his son, Louis A. Ballard. She would later pass away on January 30, 2015 in Santa Fe, New Mexico. She is buried in the Jewish section of Rivera Cemetery in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Regardless of the fact that she was not observant, nor was she affiliated with any synagogue, Louis A. Ballard felt that, because of her Jewish ancestry, she deserved a burial ceremony that was as close to a traditional Jewish burial ceremony as possible. Ballard left behind the following credo: \"It is not enough to acknowledge that Native American Indian music is merely different from other music. What is needed in America is an awakening and reorienting of our total spiritual and cultural perspectives to embrace, understand, and learn from the Aboriginal American and what motivates his musical and artistic impulses.\"\n\nHis music has been celebrated with three concerts at the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C. in 2006 as well as a memorial concert held at the same venue on November 10, 2007.\n\nBallard graduated in 1962 from the University of Tulsa, and was distinguished by being the first American Indian to receive a graduate degree in music composition. In 1969, Ballard's Ritmo Indio, a three movement work for woodwind quintet, won the Marion Nevins McDowell Award for American Chamber Music. Ballard's Desert Trilogy, his second work for ballet, was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 1971. In 1999, he was the first American composer to have a complete concert dedicated to his music at Beethovenhalle in Bonn, Germany.

In addition, he was awarded with several more awards in honor of his contributions which include: the Distinguished Service Award from the U.S. Central Office of Education, a citation in the U.S. Congressional Record, and the Cherokee Medal of Honor.\n\nBallard was also the recipient of grants from the Rockefeller Foundation, Ford Foundation, and National Endowment for the Arts. In February 1997 he received a Lifetime Musical Achievement Award from the First Americans in the Arts in Beverly Hills, California. The College of Santa Fe and William Jewell College awarded him honorary Doctor of Music degrees. In 2004 he was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n"}

Made of a mixture of three parts of coffee and seven parts of Hong Kong-style milk tea, it can be served hot or cold.\n\nIt was originally served at \"dai pai dongs\" (open air food vendors) and \"cha chaan tengs\" (café), but is now available in various types of restaurants. \n\nTea mixed with coffee is also consumed in Ethiopia, where it is known as \"spreeze.\"\n\nThe name \"Yuenyeung\", which refers to mandarin ducks (\"Yuanyang\"), is a symbol of conjugal love in Chinese culture, as the birds usually appear in pairs and the male and female look very different. This same connotation of a \"pair\" of two unlike items is used to name this drink.\n\nThere is dispute over whether other coffee-and-tea mixtures have been independently invented in the Western world, with some claiming it originally was a Dutch serving method. Various individuals have combined coffee with tea, sometimes using the name CoffTea or Tea Espress.\n\nA Hong Kong dai pai dong-style restaurant called Lan Fong Yuen (蘭芳園) claims both Yuenyeung and silk-stocking milk tea were invented in 1952 by its owner, a Mr. Lam. Its claim for the former is unverified, but that for the latter is on the record in the official minutes of a LegCo council meeting from 2007, lending it significant plausability.\n\nThe concept was later suggested on the Halfbakery in 2000, and singer Peter André claimed to have invented CoffTea in an interview in 2004.

The moderator is thus the chairperson, and is understood to be a member of the court acting . The moderator calls and constitutes meetings, presides at them, and closes them in prayer. The moderator has a casting, but not a deliberative vote. During a meeting, the title \"moderator\" is used by all other members of the court as a form of address, but this may not be continued outside the meetings. Thus this convention expresses deference to the authority of the court rather than an honour for the moderator as an individual.\n\nMany moderators act as ambassadors for their general assembly when it is not sitting, and visit many of the local churches in their denomination.\n\nIn each of the united churches of South India, of North India, of Pakistan and of Bangladesh (which all have Presbyterian roots), one of the diocesan bishops is elected Moderator of the Synod (i.e. the national governing body) for a fixed term — another is elected Vice-Moderator.

It was founded by Alfred Gray Parker and Arthur Hale.\n\nAlfred Gray Parker founded a rifle manufacturing company in 1890. In 1910, he invited his nephew, Alfred Thomas Corbyn Hale, to become a partner in the limited liability company, with the shares being taken up by members of both the Parker and Hale families. A first catalogue was issued of arms and shooting accessories and, though limited in its range, clearly showed the company's growing trend for the development of accessories.\n\nBy 1914 the company's small manufacturing plant was well established and the Ministry of Munitions ordered training equipment from Parker-Hale. The \"Parkerifling\" process, coupled with the Hiscock-Parker magazine, enabled service rifles to be converted to .22 Long Rifle (.22 LR) for use as training rifles, and demand was such that the Parker-Hale factory was soon working to full capacity.\n\nIn 1924, Hale's son, Arthur, joined the business, and in 1926 a family record was set up when Hale and his two eldest sons took part in the \"King's Prize\" at Bisley. This event was eclipsed two years later when Arthur Hale succeeded in winning the coveted prize itself. He was appointed Director of the Company in 1928.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War, the available resources of the gun trade had been mobilised to recondition a reserve of Pattern 1914 Enfield rifles, and in 1940 the Parker-Hale Arms Company was founded. Additional premises were acquired \"for the duration\" of the war and, under the management of Arthur Hale, a large reconditioning programme was rapidly carried through. A wide range of additional war contract work followed, principally with the manufacture of .30-06 Springfield and .303 British drill cartridges in large quantities.\n\nAfter the close of hostilities, with a fall in production contracts and no permanent premises, the company had little choice but to invest in a small factory unit, erected under the Government's emergency programme to re-house bombed-out manufacturers. Meanwhile, the Parker-Hale Arms Company was transferred to the Birmingham Proof House, where it continued with the reconditioning of .22 LR weapons for junior training organisations. The company ceased to exist upon completion of the contracts.\n\nThe immediate post-war years can best be described as a period of frustrated opportunity, since overseas markets were opened but materials of all sorts were in short supply. Nevertheless, by 1948 business abroad far exceeded the home trade.\n\nPositioned alongside the BSA factory sportsground and Sparkbrook, from which the local area gets its name, the Parker-Hale factory headquarter building echoes the traditions of the Birmingham gunmaking industry, since it occupies the very site that the Proof House located their testing range.\n\nBusiness at Parker-Hale remained relatively stable throughout the 1960s and into the 1980s, with sales of target and sporting rifles, handguns, shotguns and ammunition sitting comfortably alongside the company's comprehensive range of rifle scopes, knives, gun care accessories and cleaning kits.\n\nThe company received a temporary setback in 1985 when the Chairman and Managing Director, John le Breton, who had been instrumental in consolidating the company's success in world markets, retired from the board. The founder's grandson, Roger Hale, then took over as Managing Director, and proved an influential figure in successfully re-positioning the company in what was to prove a constantly changing industry.\n\nLacking the investment necessary to enable the company to compete effectively in newly emerging markets, Parker-Hale was eventually sold to the Midlands engineering group, Modular Industries Ltd. In 1992 it was purchased by Navy Arms and spun off as Gibbs Rifle Company, Inc.\n\nPartial list of Parker-Hale firearms:\n\nSubmachine guns:\nShotguns:\nSniper rifles:\n\n"}

These deposits are typically the non-marine alluvial and fluvial sediments of lowlands, as compared to deep-water flysch sediments. Sedimentation stops when the orogeny stops, or when the mountains have eroded flat.\n\nThe molasse can sometimes completely fill a foreland basin, creating a nearly flat depositional surface, that nonetheless remains a structural syncline.

In 1998, he and newcomer Yoshihiro Takayama formed the NO FEAR tag team. The team soon won both the All Asia Tag Team Championship and the World Tag Team Championship, becoming the first team to win both titles at the same time. When Mitsuharu Misawa formed Pro Wrestling Noah, they followed him and dyed their hair blond to match the change of environment.\n\nOmori's first American venture was in the World Wrestling Federation, where he competed in the 1996 Royal Rumble. He was eliminated by the returning Jake Roberts.\n\nFor an undisclosed reason, Omori called for an early ending to his singles bout with Shinya Hashimoto in the middle of their singles match at Noah's Great Voyage 2000 event, which was the company's most important event up to that point. Because of this, Omori was immediately in Misawa's doghouse, and after the NO FEAR team broke up (so Takayama could pursue mixed martial arts matches) Omori was sent abroad to Harley Race's World League Wrestling promotion in the American Midwest, where he won the company's heavyweight title. During his excursion, Misawa continued to deny that Omori had been sent abroad by Noah, and Omori was not welcomed back to Noah when he returned from the excursion. As a result, Omori joined Fighting World of Japan Pro Wrestling, where he feuded with Riki Choshu, Genichiro Tenryu and Kensuke Sasaki.\n\nIn 2004, he joined Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX, where he was one of the strong native competitors along with (fellow Hamaguchi Dojo classmate) Shinjiro Otani. He has feuded with old team mate Yoshihiro Takayama, resulting in many bloody battles and disqualifications. On March 8, 2007, he and Manabu Nakanishi lost the ZERO1-MAX Intercontinental Tag Team Championship to Yoshihiro Takayama and Kohei Sato. On March 31, 2007, he defeated Steve Corino for the AWA Superstars of Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship, becoming a three-time champion. Nearly seven months to the day Omori won the AWA World Heavyweight championship, he would lose the title to Masato Tanaka. On August 16, 2008 Omori announced that he was leaving ZERO1-MAX and taking a break from pro wrestling.\n\nThis break would not last long, as Omori appeared at a New Japan Pro Wrestling show on March 15, 2009 to revive his team with Manabu Nakanishi. He also participated in the 2009 G1 Climax, pulling off two impressive victories in his first two matches by defeating both IWGP Heavyweight Champion Hiroshi Tanahashi and eventual tournament winner Togi Makabe. In January 2010 Omori announced his semi-retirement.\n\nSince semi-retiring, Omori had been wrestling select shows in various promotions, both mainstream and independent. In 2011, he has been wrestling semi-regularly with All Japan Pro Wrestling. Following the 2011 World's Strongest Tag Determination League, Omori appealed to Keiji Mutoh to officially join All Japan and Mutoh granted the request, officially rejoining All Japan.\n\nOmori's first match back as an official member of the AJPW roster took place on December 25, 2011, teaming up with Manabu Soya and Seiya Sanada in a loss to Akebono, Keiji Mutoh, and Super Delfin. On March 20, 2012, Omori and Soya defeated Dark Cuervo and Dark Ozz for the World Tag Team Championship. After losing the title to Joe Doering and Seiya Sanada on May 20, Omori and Soya, known collectively as \"Get Wild\", regained the title on June 17. They vacated the title on October 30, in time for the 2012 World's Strongest Tag Determination League. On November 30, Get Wild won the tournament to regain the title. On December 11, Soya unsuccessfully challenged Masakatsu Funaki for the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship. As a result, Get Wild was forced to disband, despite still holding the World Tag Team Championship. Get Wild went on to lose the title to Burning (Go Shiozaki and Jun Akiyama) on March 17, 2013. Following Soya's resignation from AJPW, Omori revived his team with Akiyama, naming it \"Wild Burning\" in January 2014. On February 8, Wild Burning unsuccessfully challenged Evolution (Joe Doering and Suwama) for the World Tag Team Championship. On April 27, Omori won his first Champion Carnival, defeating Jun Akiyama in the finals. On June 15, Omori defeated Akiyama in a rematch to win the vacant Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship for the first time. On June 28, Omori became only the sixth \"Quintuple Crown Champion\" in All Japan history, when he and Akiyama defeated Joe Doering and Suwama to win the World Tag Team Championship. However, the next day, Omori lost the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship to Suwama, ending his reign at just 14 days. After successfully defending the World Tag Team Championship against Akebono and Yutaka Yoshie on October 22, Omori and Akiyama vacated the title the following day in time for the 2014 World's Strongest Tag Determination League. They regained the title by winning the tournament on December 6, defeating Go Shiozaki and Kento Miyahara in the finals. Wild Burning's second reign ended on March 22, 2015, when they were defeated by Akebono and Yutaka Yoshie. On January 1, 2016, Omori was appointed to the All Japan Board of Directors. On December 18, the reunited Get Wild defeated Jake Lee and Kento Miyahara in the finals to win the 2016 World's Strongest Tag Determination League.\n\n<br><br>\n"}

Rubinstein) with \"Tales from the Darkside\", and in some ways succeeded the show (which ended the same year it began). It differed in some respects nonetheless. While \"Tales\" sometimes dabbles in stories of science fiction and fantasy, this series is more strictly horror. As the name implies, each episode (with very few exceptions) features a different monster which the story concerned, from the animatronic puppet of a fictional children's television program to mutated, weapon-wielding lab rats.\n\nThe series has featured cameos from celebrities including: Anne Meara and Jerry Stiller, Laura Branigan, Troy Donahue, Linda Blair, Deborah Harry, Kaye Ballard, Imogene Coca, Farley Granger, Pam Grier, Wil Wheaton, and Meat Loaf.\n\nThe introduction of the show begins with an aerial view of a middle class suburban neighborhood, drawing closer to what seems to be a typical Cape Cod style house. The camera enters this innocent setting as a father and daughter sit before an old television. The mother enters, revealing herself to be a horned cyclops, pushing a cart and remarking, \"Honey, it's family hour, there must be something on.\" The daughter rushes to the cart, also a horned cyclops with green, molting hands, exclaims as she uncovers the dish, \"Oh wow, Candied Critters!\" As the mother and daughter make themselves comfortable, the father, a potato-like humanoid with one hand mostly root-shaped and molting green (a literal \"couch potato\"), makes a noise of surprise as the mother exclaims, \"It's \"Monsters\", our favorite show!\" The daughter quietly replies, \"Shh, it's starting.\" As the camera zooms in on the father's face, his low chuckle morphs into a high pitched giggle as the title fills the screen.\n\nEach episode is a stand-alone tale, none of the episodes connect with each other, and feature a variety of monsters from vicious man eating plants to friendly aliens from outer space.\n\nThe series was well known for its guest stars, many of whom went on to become famous. These included Lili Taylor (in \"Habitat\"), David Spade (in \"Small Blessings\"), Tony Shalhoub (in \"Leavings\"), Steve Buscemi (in \"Bed and Boar\"), Gina Gershon (in \"Jar\"), Matt LeBlanc (in \"Shave and a Haircut, Two Bites\"), Tori Spelling (in \"The Match Game\") and Chris Noth (in \"Satan in the Suburbs\") .\n\nA number of directors helmed more than one episode.

Farino each directed four episodes; Gerald Cotts (directing as \"Jerry Smith\") and Jeffrey Wolf each directed three episodes; and Warner Shook, Theodore Gershuny, Brian Thomas Jones, Allen Coulter, and Tom Noonan each directed two episodes.\n\nSeveral writers also wrote more than one episode. Edithe Swensen wrote six scripts, and the writing team of Peg Haller and Bob Schneider wrote five scripts. Michael Reaves and Benjamin Carr (writing as \"Neal Marshall Stevens\") each wrote four episodes. Jule Selbo, Joseph Anderson, Michael Kimball, D. Emerson Smith, and Haskell Barkin each wrote three scripts, while Harvey Jacobs, David Misch, Paul Dini, Michael McDowell, David Odell, and Dan Simmons each wrote two.\n\nThree stories by noted fantasy and horror author Robert Bloch were used for the series. Theodore Gershuny contributed two stories to the series (and a script).\n\nFour individuals both wrote and directed the same episode: Bruce Feirstein, Robert T. Megginson, Scott Alexander, and Tom Noonan.\n\nDirector Allen Coulter also contributed a story.\n\n\"Monsters\" is generally considered a horror anthology. But the show was about monsters, whether in a horror context or not. Although \"New York Honey\" (the third episode aired) is the first episode to mix humor and horror, \"My Zombie Lover\" (the fifth episode to air) was played strictly for laughs (\"black comedy\") and was not meant to be taken seriously (e.g., to horrify). Eleven episodes were played for laughs rather than horror. The show is also well known for its \"twist endings\". This occurs many times in the series: An ally turns out to be a secret enemy, a villain's victory turns sour in the final seconds of the show, a wish is revealed to have a negative downside. However, more than a quarter of the show's episodes had no twist ending, and were straightforward horror stories. \"The Vampire Hunter\" is one example of this. Others include \"Sleeping Dragon\", \"The Match Game\", \"The Mandrake Root\", \"Cellmates\", and \"Household Gods.\"\n\nThe series used special effects, makeup, costuming, and other theatrical tricks to create believable monsters. Particularly good effects or makeup occurred in \"My Zombie Lover\" (the zombie boy's makeup), \"Mannikins of Horror\" (the mannequins are well-animated), \"Love Hurts\" (the zombie's makeup), \"Jar\" (the swamp monster is visually effective), \"The Offering\" (the giant cancer-inducing bugs are visually effective), \"Stressed Environment\" (the anthropomorphic rats are well-animated), \"The Hole\" (the zombie makeup), and \"The Moving Finger\" (the finger is well-animated). But poor special effects were just as common. They occurred in \"New York Honey\" (the queen bee visible at the end of the episode), \"Glim-Glim\" (the alien, Glim-Glim), \"Their Divided Self\" (the conjoined twins), \"Half as Old as Time\" (the exceptionally poor make-up on Leif Garrett), \"Mr. Swlabr\" (the reptilian title character), \"Micro Minds\" (the enlarged monstrous virus visible at the end), \"Murray's Monster\" (a particularly poor monster suit), and \"The Space-Eaters\" (a giant glowing eye).\n\nThe series also included a number of sexually explicit episodes. Among the episodes which included risqué love-making scenes were \"The Cocoon\", \"Love Hurts\", \"Jar\", \"The Mandrake Root\", \"Museum Hearts\", \"Desirable Alien\", \"Bug House\", and \"The Young and the Headless\". Bare breasts were seen twice in the third season. In \"Stressed Environment\", a real woman's breast is seen on screen for several seconds as a character dresses. In \"Leavings\", the camera lingers on a fake woman's breast for several seconds. In one shot, the fake breast fills the screen.\n\nThe series focused on a wide variety of monsters. Among the most popular were aliens (featured in eight episodes) and demons (featured in six episodes). Vampires and zombies were the focus of four episodes each, while ghosts, reptilian creatures, and witches figured strongly in three episodes each. Cursed Native American objects, giant spiders or spider-like people, and werewolves were also common. A mummy was depicted only once.\n\nShort stories such as \"The Moving Finger\" from well-known authors like Stephen King were also adapted into episodes of the series.\n\nThere were 72 episodes of the series produced over three seasons. There were 24 episodes per season.\n\nOn February 25, 2014, eOne Entertainment released the complete series on DVD in Region 1.\n\n"}

{"id": "2224833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224833", "title": "Danaya", "text": "Danaya\n\nSang'gre Danaya (later Hara Danaya, eighth Queen of Lireo) is a character and one of the protagonists of the \"Encantadia\" series, written by Suzette Doctolero. The \"Encantadia\" franchise, consisting of four series \"Encantadia\" (2005), \"Etheria\" (2005–06), \"\" (2006), and \"Encantadia\" (2016), is primarily focused on Danaya's journey to save the realm against the invaders. Danaya is portrayed by actress Diana Zubiri on the first 3 series, while Sanya Lopez portrayed her in the 2016 series of the same name.\n\nIn \"Encantadia\", Danaya is the youngest daughter of Mine-a, the Queen of Lireo to a diwata named Enuo. She was known as the Keeper of the Gem of Earth. She is known for her bravery and her loyalty to laws and orders in Encantadia. She really wants to be with Aquil for the rest of her life In the end, she ascended the throne of Lireo after Lira, Amihan's daughter, refused to succeed her mother. She continued her reign until \"Etheria\" (2006). She was then succeeded by her niece Cassandra, Lira's daughter in \"Encantadia: Pag-ibig Hanggang Wakas\" (2006).\n\nEncantadia is a spin-off of Mulawin. In Mulawin, a similar character named Florona (portrayed by Bettina Carlos) was Encantadia's diwata of the earth and could be considered as the first version of the character.\nThe name \"Danaya\" may be a play on \"Diana\", which is the name of the actress Diana Zubiri who first played the role. It is also linked with the Roman goddess Diana, goddess of the hunt, the moon, and nature being associated with wild animals and woodland, and having the power to talk to and control animals. The story unfolds in Lireo, the kingdom where Queen Mine-a lives with her daughters Amihan, Alena, Danaya, and Pirena. The four Sangg'res are tasked to be the new keepers of the brilyantes. Their skills in war and their powers as the royalty of the diwatas are believed to be the strength of Lireo. As long as the gemstones are kept properly, the balance of nature in Encantadia remains.\n\nDanaya is the fourth and the youngest daughter of Mine-a and her second daughter with Enuo. Her father is a \"diwata\" who knows much about Encantadia's flora and fauna. She is also excellent in healing diseases or wounds with the help of the Earth gem. The youngest of Minea's daughters, Danaya is a determined fighter whose loyalty to the throne and laws of her Kingdom is absolute. She was described as just, fearless and prudent among the four sisters. She knows her kingdom’s laws by heart, and while she may be extremely stubborn, she’s one to do things by the book. Because of her relative youth, she is prone to playfulness and argue most of the time especially with her niece Lira and sister Pirena. Though Danaya can use swords and other arsenals as shown in \"Etheria\", her weapon of choice is an arnis stick (kali) called \"\"eskrima\"\". Aside from her weapon, she can also shape-shift into any animals or things she wish to.\n\nWhen her sister Pirena stole the Gem of Fire, her mother Mine-a handed her the \"Brilyante ng Lupa\" for safe keeping. With this, she is tasked to take care of nature and environment in Encantadia. Danaya was one of her mother's choice to ascend the throne of Lireo, but was defeated during the challenge. When her sister Amihan gave birth to Lira, as the wisest of the Sang'gres, she gave a magical gift to Lira, that she will never be harmed by Pirena. This happened when Pirena, a defector of Lireo, came back to ask for their forgiveness, Danaya was not convinced and did not bestowed her full trust to her. As part of Pirena's plan to overthrow Amihan from her throne, Danaya was attacked by Pirena and made an attempt on Amihan's life disguised as Danaya, leading to her exile in the mortal world. This would make easier for Pirena to penetrate the forces of Lireo. In the mortal world, she accidentally met Milagros, the true daughter of Amihan guarded by a \"lambana\" named Muyak. Danaya had several failed attempts to convince Mila about her origin. She was then followed by the Hathors including Hagorn and succeeded in killing her niece, Mila. She was later helped by Mulawin's Dakila and Bagwis and went to Halconia to look for Mercurios to bring Mila back to life. They went back to Encantadia and reunited with her sisters. She helped Amihan reclaim the throne of Lireo. When the war is over and Amihan had to pass on her crown to Lira, she refused and rather chose to go back to the mortal world to be with Anthony. Renouncing the throne, her mother and the other Sang'gres chose Danaya as the new Queen of Lireo after Pirena refused, and Alena be crowned as the future Queen of Sapiro.\n\nA prophecy by Ether was established a long time ago that if the last kin of the diwatas was born, the fallen Kingdom of Etheria will rise again. When Cassandra, granddaughter of Amihan was born, the prophecy became true and the fallen Kingdom poses a threat to now peaceful Encantadia. Danaya with her three sisters went back to the past to revert the prophecy by changing the history. Danaya headed their fight against the four Herans of Etheria in which they gain victory with the help of the \"\"Inang brilyante\"\". This became Danaya's way to revert the past and bring back the life of Aquil, head of Lirean army and her love interest.\n\nBecause of the defeat of the Etherians, Ether flew around her kingdom which was all destroyed to find the Four herans. She found them all and kept their spirits in a crystal ball and brought them to the future. The Crystal ball broke and their spirits became free. They practiced fighting and planned to steal the four gems so Etheria may once again rise back in glory. Danaya fought against the Etherians once again to keep the gems in their territory. During the last war of Encantadia, she faces her \"\"gabay-diwa\"\", Sari-a. In a few years, she descended her throne and was succeeded by Cassandra, Lira's daughter. Legend says she settled with Aquil in the forest of Lireo and eventually vanished together with her other sisters.\n\nThe 2016 series is a reboot (often called as \"requel\" or retelling-sequel) to the 2005 fantasy series with the same name. It is the fourth series of the Encantadia franchise and is 11 years apart from the third one. It features the same character and story of Danaya with the 2005 series. It was portrayed by actress Sanya Lopez who underwent vigorous training and repeated audition call backs.\n"}

{"id": "2224857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224857", "title": "Radicalism (historical)", "text": "Radicalism (historical)\n\nThe term \"Radical\" (from the Latin meaning root), during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, identified proponents of democratic reform, in what subsequently became the parliamentary Radical Movement.\n\nDuring the 19th century in the United Kingdom, continental Europe and Latin America, the term \"Radical\" came to denote a progressive liberal ideology inspired by the French Revolution. Historically, Radicalism emerged in an early form with the French Revolution and the similar movements it inspired in other countries. It grew prominent during the 1830s in the United Kingdom (the Chartists) and Belgium (see the Revolution of 1830), then across Europe in the 1840s–50s (see the Revolutions of 1848). In contrast to the social conservatism of existing liberal politics, Radicalism sought political support for a \"radical reform\" of the electoral system to widen the franchise. It was also associated with republicanism; civic nationalism; abolition of titles; rationalism and the resistance to a single established state religion; redistribution of property; and freedom of the press.\n\nIn nineteenth-century France, Radicalism had emerged as a minor political force by the 1840s, as the extreme left of the day (in contrast to the socially conservative liberalism of the Moderate Republicans and Orléanists monarchists, and the anti-parliamentarianism of the Legitimist monarchists and Bonapartists). By the 1890s the French Radicals were not organised under a single nationwide structure, but had become a significant political force in parliament; in 1901 they consolidated their efforts by forming the country's first major extra-parliamentary political party, the Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party, which became the most important party of government during the second half (1899 to 1940) of the Third Republic. The success of the French PRRRS encouraged Radicals elsewhere to organise themselves into formal parties in a range of other countries in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, with Radicals holding significant political office in Switzerland, Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, Bulgaria, Romania, and Russia. During the interwar, European Radical parties organised their own international, the Radical Entente.\n\nAs social democracy emerged as a distinct political force in its own right, the differences that once existed between left-wing radicalism and conservative liberalism diminished, and between 1940 and 1973 Radicalism became defunct in most of its European heartlands, its role and philosophy taken on by social democratic and conservative-liberal parties.\n\nThe two Enlightenment philosophies of Liberalism and Radicalism both shared the goal of liberating humanity from traditionalism. But Liberals regarded it as sufficient to establish individual rights that would protect the individual. Radicals, however, sought institutional, social/economic, and especially cultural/educational reform to allow every citizen to put those rights into practice. For this reason we could say that Radicalism went beyond the demand for liberty, by seeking also equality, that is, universality (see Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité).\n\nIn some countries, Radicalism represented a minor wing within the Liberal political family, as in the case of England's Radical Whigs. Sometimes the Radical wing of the Liberals were hardline or doctrinaire, and in other cases more moderate and pragmatic.\n\nIn other countries, Radicalism had had enough electoral support on its own, or a favourable electoral system or coalition partners, to maintain distinct Radical parties: Switzerland and Germany (\"Freisinn\"), Bulgaria, Denmark, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, but also Argentina (Radical Civic Union), Chile and Paraguay.\n\nVictorian era Britain possessed both trends: In England the Radicals were simply the left wing of the Liberal coalition, though they often rebelled when the coalition's socially conservative Whigs resisted democratic reforms, whereas in Ireland Radicals lost faith in the ability of parliamentary gradualism to deliver egalitarian and democratic reform and, breaking away from the main body of liberals, pursued a radical-democratic parliamentary republic through separatism and insurrection. \n\nThis does not mean that all radical parties were formed by left-wing liberals. In French political literature, it is normal to make a clear separation between Radicalism as a distinct political force to the left of Liberalism but to the right of Socialism. Over time, as new left-wing parties formed to address the new social issues, the right wing of the Radicals would splinter off in disagreement with the main Radical family and became absorbed as the left wing of the Liberal family—rather than the other way around, as in Britain and Belgium.\n\nHowever, the distinction between Radicals and Liberals was made clear by the two mid-20th-century attempts to create an international for centrist democratic parties. In 1923-4, the French Radicals created an \"Entente Internationale des Partis Radicaux et des Partis Démocratiques similaires\": it was joined by the centre-left Radical parties of Europe, and in the democracies where no equivalent existed—Britain and Belgium—the liberal party was to allowed attend instead. After the Second World War the Radical International was not reformed; instead, a centre-right Liberal International was established, closer to the conservative-liberalism of the British and Belgian Liberal parties. This marked the end of Radicalism as an independent political force in Europe, though some countries such as France and Switzerland retained politically-important Radical parties well into the 1950s–1960s.\n\nThus, many European parties that are nowadays categorised in the group of social-liberal parties have a historical affinity with radicalism and may therefore be called \"liberal-radical\".\n\nAccording to \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", the first use of the word \"Radical\" in a political sense is generally ascribed to the English parliamentarian Charles James Fox, a leader of the left wing of the Whig party who dissented from the party's conservative-liberalism and looked favourably upon the radical reforms being undertaken by French republicans, such as universal male suffrage. In 1797, Fox declared for a \"radical reform\" of the electoral system. This led to a general use of the term to identify all supporting the movement for parliamentary reform.\n\nInitially confined to the upper and middle classes, in the early 19th century \"popular radicals\" brought artisans and the \"labouring classes\" into widespread agitation in the face of harsh government repression. More respectable \"philosophical radicals\" followed the utilitarian philosophy of Jeremy Bentham and strongly supported parliamentary reform, but were generally hostile to the arguments and tactics of the \"popular radicals\". By the middle of the century, parliamentary Radicals joined with others in the Parliament of the United Kingdom to form the Liberal Party, eventually achieving reform of the electoral system.\n\nThe Radical movement had its beginnings at a time of tension between the American colonies and Great Britain, with the first Radicals, angry at the state of the House of Commons, drawing on the Leveller tradition and similarly demanding improved parliamentary representation. These earlier concepts of democratic and even egalitarian reform had emerged in the turmoil of the English Civil War and the brief establishment of the republican Commonwealth of England amongst the vague political grouping known as the Levellers, but with the English Restoration of the monarchy such ideas had been discredited. Although the Glorious Revolution of 1688 had increased parliamentary power with a constitutional monarchy and the union of the parliaments brought England and Scotland together, towards the end of the 18th century the monarch still had considerable influence over the Parliament of Great Britain which itself was dominated by the English aristocracy and by patronage. Candidates for the House of Commons stood as Whigs or Tories, but once elected formed shifting coalitions of interests rather than splitting along party lines. At general elections, the vote was restricted to property owners in constituencies which were out of date and did not reflect the growing importance of manufacturing towns or shifts of population, so that in many rotten borough seats could be bought or were controlled by rich landowners while major cities remained unrepresented. Discontent with these inequities inspired those individuals who later became known as the \"Radical Whigs\".\n\nWilliam Beckford fostered early interest in reform in the London area. The \"Middlesex radicals\" were led by the politician John Wilkes, an opponent of war with the colonies who started his weekly publication \"The North Briton\" in 1764 and within two years had been charged with seditious libel and expelled from the House of Commons. The Society for the Defence of the Bill of Rights which he started in 1769 to support his re-election, developed the belief that every man had the right to vote and \"natural reason\" enabling him to properly judge political issues. Liberty consisted in frequent elections and for the first time middle-class radicals obtained the backing of the London \"mob\". Middlesex and Westminster were among the few parliamentary constituencies with a large and socially diverse electorate including many artisans as well as the middle class and aristocracy and along with the county association of Yorkshire led by the Reverend Christopher Wyvill were at the forefront of reform activity. The writings of what became known as the \"Radical Whigs\" had an influence on the American Revolution.\n\nMajor John Cartwright also supported the colonists, even as the American Revolutionary War began and in 1776 earned the title of the \"Father of Reform\" when he published his pamphlet \"Take Your Choice!\" advocating annual parliaments, the secret ballot and manhood suffrage. In 1780, a draft programme of reform was drawn up by Charles James Fox and Thomas Brand Hollis and put forward by a sub-committee of the electors of Westminster. This included calls for the six points later adopted in the \"People's Charter\" (see Chartists below).\n\nThe American Revolutionary War ended in humiliating defeat of a policy which King George III had fervently advocated and in March 1782 the King was forced to appoint an administration led by his opponents which sought to curb Royal patronage. In November 1783, he took his opportunity and used his influence in the House of Lords to defeat a Bill to reform the British East India Company, dismissed the government and appointed William Pitt the Younger as his Prime Minister. Pitt had previously called for Parliament to begin to reform itself, but he did not press for long for reforms the King did not like. Proposals Pitt made in April 1785 to redistribute seats from the \"rotten boroughs\" to London and the counties were defeated in the House of Commons by 248 votes to 174.\n\nIn the wake of the French Revolution of 1789, Thomas Paine wrote \"The Rights of Man\" (1791) as a response to Burke's counterrevolutionary essay \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\" (1790), itself an attack on Richard Price's sermon that kicked off the so-called \"pamphlet war\" known as the Revolution Controversy. Mary Wollstonecraft, another supporter of Price, soon followed with \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\". They encouraged mass support for democratic reform along with rejection of the monarchy, aristocracy and all forms of privilege. Different strands of the movement developed, with middle class \"reformers\" aiming to widen the franchise to represent commercial and industrial interests and towns without parliamentary representation, while \"Popular radicals\" drawn from the middle class and from artisans agitated to assert wider rights including relieving distress. The theoretical basis for electoral reform was provided by \"Philosophical radicals\" who followed the utilitarian philosophy of Jeremy Bentham and strongly supported parliamentary reform, but were generally hostile to the arguments and tactics of the \"popular radicals\".\n\nIn Ireland the United Irishmen movement took another direction, adding to the doctrine of a secular and parliamentary republic inspired by the American and French republican revolutions, another doctrine of the French Revolution: civic nationalism. Dismayed by the inability of British parliamentarianism to introduce the root-and-branch democratic reforms desired, Irish Radicals channelled their movement into a republican form of nationalism that would provide equality as well as liberty. This was pursued through armed revolution and often with French assistance at various points over the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\n\nPopular Radicals were quick to go further than Paine, with Newcastle schoolmaster Thomas Spence demanding land nationalisation to redistribute wealth in a penny periodical he called \"Pig's Meat\" in a reference to Edmund Burke's phrase \"swinish multitude\". Radical organisations sprang up, such as the London Corresponding Society of artisans formed in January 1792 under the leadership of the shoemaker Thomas Hardy to call for the vote. One such was the Scottish \"Friends of the People\" society which in October 1793 held a British convention in Edinburgh with delegates from some of the English corresponding societies. They issued a manifesto demanding universal male suffrage with annual elections and expressing their support for the principles of the French Revolution. The numbers involved in these movements were small and most wanted reform rather than revolution, but for the first time working men were organising for political change.\n\nThe government reacted harshly, imprisoning leading Scottish radicals, temporarily suspending habeas corpus in England and passing the Seditious Meetings Act 1795 which meant that a license was needed for any meeting in a public place consisting of fifty or more people. Throughout the Napoleonic Wars, the government took extensive stern measures against feared domestic unrest. The corresponding societies ended, but some radicals continued in secret, with Irish sympathisers in particular forming secret societies to overturn the government and encourage mutinies. In 1812, Major John Cartwright formed the first Hampden Club, named after the English Civil War Parliamentary leader John Hampden, aiming to bring together middle class moderates and lower class radicals.\n\nAfter the Napoleonic Wars, the Corn laws (in force between 1815 and 1846) and bad harvests fostered discontent. The publications of William Cobbett were influential and at political meetings speakers like Henry Hunt complained that only three men in a hundred had the vote. Writers like the radicals William Hone and Thomas Jonathan Wooler spread dissent with publications such as \"The Black Dwarf\" in defiance of a series of government acts to curb circulation of political literature. Radical riots in 1816 and 1817 were followed by the Peterloo massacre of 1819 publicised by Richard Carlile, who then continued to fight for press freedom from prison. The Six Acts of 1819 limited the right to demonstrate or hold public meetings. In Scotland, agitation over three years culminated in an attempted general strike and abortive workers' uprising crushed by government troops in the \"Radical War\" of 1820. Magistrates powers were increased to crush demonstrations by manufacturers and action by radical Luddites.\n\nTo counter the established Church of England doctrine that the aristocratic social order was divinely ordained, radicals supported Lamarckian Evolutionism, a theme proclaimed by street corner agitators as well as some established scientists such as Robert Edmund Grant.\n\nEconomic conditions improved after 1821 and the United Kingdom government made economic and criminal law improvements, abandoning policies of repression. In 1823, Jeremy Bentham co-founded the \"Westminster Review\" with James Mill as a journal for \"philosophical radicals\", setting out the utilitarian philosophy that right actions were to be measured in proportion to the greatest good they achieved for the greatest number. Westminster elected two radicals to Parliament during the 1820s.\n\nThe Whigs gained power and despite defeats in the House of Commons and the House of Lords the Reform Act 1832 was put through with the support of public outcry, mass meetings of \"political unions\" and riots in some cities. This now enfranchised the middle classes, but failed to meet radical demands. The Whigs introduced reforming measures owing much to the ideas of the philosophic radicals, abolishing slavery and in 1834 introducing Malthusian Poor Law reforms which were bitterly opposed by \"popular radicals\" and writers like Thomas Carlyle. Following the 1832 Reform Act, the mainly aristocratic Whigs in the House of Commons were joined by a small number of parliamentary Radicals as well as an increased number of middle class Whigs. By 1839, they were informally being called \"the Liberal party\".\n\nFrom 1836, working class Radicals unified around the Chartist cause of electoral reform expressed in the \"People's Charter\" drawn up by six members of Parliament and six from the London Working Men's Association (associated with Owenite Utopian socialism), which called for six points: universal suffrage, equal-sized electoral districts, secret ballot, an end to property qualification for Parliament, pay for Members of Parliament and Annual Parliaments. Chartists also expressed economic grievances, but their mass demonstrations and petitions to parliament were unsuccessful.\n\nDespite initial disagreements, after their failure their cause was taken up by the middle class Anti-Corn Law League founded by Richard Cobden and John Bright in 1839 to oppose duties on imported grain which raised the price of food and so helped landowners at the expense of ordinary people.\n\nThe parliamentary Radicals joined with the Whigs and anti-protectionist Tory Peelites to form the Liberal Party by 1859. Demand for parliamentary reform increased by 1864 with agitation from John Bright and the Reform League.\n\nWhen the Liberal government led by Lord Russell and William Ewart Gladstone introduced a modest bill for parliamentary reform, it was defeated by both Tories and reform Liberals, forcing the government to resign. The Tories under Lord Derby and Benjamin Disraeli took office and the new government decided to \"dish the Whigs\" and \"take a leap in the dark\" to take the credit for the reform. As a minority government, they had to accept radical amendments and Disraeli's Reform Act 1867 almost doubled the electorate, giving the vote even to working men.\n\nThe Radicals, having been strenuous in their efforts on behalf of the working classes, earned a deeply loyal following—British trade unionists from 1874 until 1892, upon being elected to Parliament, never considered themselves to be anything other than Radicals and were labeled Lib-Lab candidates. Radical trade unionists formed the basis for what later became the Labour Party.\n\nThe territories of modern Belgium had been merged into the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815. Aside from various religious and socioeconomic tensions between the Dutch north and proto-Belgian south, over the 1820s a young generation of Belgians, heavily influenced by French Enlightenment ideas, had formulated criticisms of the Dutch monarchy as autocratic. The monarch enjoyed broad personal powers, his ministers were irresponsible before parliament; the separation of powers was minimal; freedom of press and association were limited; the principle of universal suffrage was undermined by the fact that the largely Catholic south, despite possessing two-thirds of the population, received as many seats to the Estates-General (parliament) as the smaller Protestant north; and the Dutch authorities were suspected of forcing Protestantism onto Catholics. These concerns combined to produce a pro-Catholic Radicalism distinct from both the anticlerical Radicalism of France, and the Protestant Liberalism of the Dutch north.\n\nFollowing the political crisis of 1829, where the Crown Prince was named prime minister, a limited reform was introduced establishing constitutional rights, similar to the charter of rights of France's autocratic Restoration Monarchy; the Belgian Radicals, like their French counterparts, regarded such a charter of rights as insufficient, potentially revocable by a whim of the monarch. Belgian Radicals closely followed the situation in France when, on 26 July to 1 August 1830, a conservative-liberal revolution broke out, overthrowing the autocratic monarchy for a liberal constitutional monarchy. Within a month a revolt had erupted in Brussels before spreading to the rest of the Belgian provinces. After Belgian independence, the Constitution of 1831 established a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary regime, and provided a list of fundamental civil rights inspired by the French Declaration of the Right of Man.\n\nAs in Britain, Radicals in Belgium continued to operate within the Liberal Party, campaigning throughout the 19th Century for the property-restricted suffrage to be extended. This was extended a first time in 1883, and universal male suffrage was achieved in 1893 (though female suffrage would have to wait until 1919). After this Radicalism was a minor political force in Belgium, its role taken over by the emergence of a powerful social-democratic party.\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, the Radicals in France were the political group of the far-left, relative to the centre-left \"opportunists\" (Gambetta: conservative-liberal and republican), the centre-right Orléanists (conservative-liberal and monarchist), the far-right Legitimists (anti-liberal monarchist), and the supporters of a republican military dictatorship,the Bonapartists.\n\nFollowing the Napoleonic Wars and until 1848, it was technically illegal to advocate republicanism openly. Some republicans reconciled themselves to pursuing liberalism through the socially-conservative monarchy—the 'opportunists'. Those who remained intransigent in believing that the French Revolution needed to be completed through a republican regime based on parliamentary democracy and universal suffrage therefore tended to call themselves \"Radicals\" – a term meaning 'Purists'.\n\nUnder the Second Republic (1848–52), the Radicals, on a platform of seeking a \"social and democratic republic\", sat together in parliament in a group named The Mountain. When Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte launched his military coup, Radicals across France rose up in insurrection to defend the democratic republic. This experience would mark French Radicalism for the next century, prompting permanent vigilance against all those who – from Marshall Mac-Mahon to General De Gaulle – were suspected of seeking to overthrow the constitutional, parliamentary regime.\n\nAfter the return to parliamentary democracy in 1871, the Radicals emerged as a significant political force: led by Georges Clemenceau, they claimed that the socially-conservative liberal republicanism of Léon Gambetta and Jules Ferry had drifted away from the ideals of the French Revolution, and that the Radicals were the true heirs to 1791. In 1881, they put forward their programme of broad social reforms: from then on, the tactic of the main Radical Party was to have 'no enemies to the left' of the Republic, allying with any group that sought social reform while accepting the legality of the parliamentary republic.\n\nBut the Radicals were not yet a political party: they sat together in parliament out of kinship, but they possessed minimal organisation outside of parliament. The first half of the Third Republic saw several events that caused them to fear a far-right takeover of parliament that might end democracy, as Louis-Napoléon had: Marshall Mac-Mahon's self-coup in 1876, the General Boulanger crisis in the 1880s, the Dreyfus Affair in the 1890s. The Radicals were swept to power first in a coalition government (1899) then in governments of their own from 1902. They finally managed to implement their long-standing programme of reforms, such as the separation of Church and State, or the introduction of secret ballotting. In order to ensure that their legacy would remain unreversed, they unified the local Radical committees into an elector party: the Radical-Socialist Party, the first major modern political party in French history.\n\nIntellectuals played a powerful role. A major spokesman of radicalism was Émile Chartier (1868-1951), who wrote under the pseudonym \"Alain.\" He was a leading theorist of radicalism, and his influence extended through the Third and Fourth Republics. He stressed individualism, seeking to defend the citizen against the state. He warned against all forms of power – military, clerical, and economic. To oppose them he exalted the small farmer, the small shopkeeper, the small town, and the little man. He idealized country life and saw Paris as a dangerous font of power.\n\nThe Radical–Socialist Party was the main governmental party of the Third Republic between 1901 and 1919, and dominated government again between 1924–26, 1932–33 and 1937–40; the centre-right governments dominated by the conservative-liberal centre-right often gave a portfolio to a Radical, who would join cabinet in a personal capacity as the most left-leaning minister.\n\nThe party itself was discredited after 1940, due to fact that many (though not all) of its parliamentarians had votedto establish the Vichy regime. Under the dictatorship several prominent Radicals, such as the young left-leaning former education minister Jean Zay, and the influential editorialist Maurice Sarraut (brother to the more famous Radical party leader Albert), were assassinated by the regime's paramilitary police, while others, notably Jean Moulin, participated in the resistance movement to restore the Republic.\n\nThe Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance was established after World War II to combine the politics of French Radicalism with credibility derived from members' activism in the French resistance.\n\nIn the 1950s, Pierre Mendès-France attempted to rebuilt the Radical Party as an alternative to both the Christian-democratic MRP, while also leading the opposition to Gaullism which he feared to be another attempt at a right-wing coup. During this period the Radicals frequently governed as part of a coalition of centrist parties, spanning from the Socialists to the Christian-democrats.\n\nUltimately the installation of the Fifth Republic in 1958, and the subsequent emergence of a two-party system based on the Socialist and Gaullist movements, destroyed the niche for an autonomous Radical party. The Radical Party split into various tendencies. Its leading personality, Mendès-France himself, left in 1961 in protest at the party's acceptance of De Gaulle's military coup and joining the small social-democratic Unified Socialist Party. A decade later, a second faction advocated maintaining an alliance with the Socialist-dominated coalition of the left; it broke away in 1972 to form the Radical Party of the Left, which maintains close ties to the Socialist Party. The remainder of the original Radical Party became a de facto liberal-conservative party of the centre-right: renamed as the 'Valoisien' Radical Party, it advocated alliances with the rest of the liberal centre-right, participating first in the pro-Giscard d'Estaing Union for French Democracy (1972), then with the conservative Union for a Popular Movement (2002).\n\nIn continental Europe and Latin America, as for instance in France, Italy, Spain, Chile and Argentina (Radical Civic Union), Radicalism developed as an ideology in the 19th century to indicate those who supported at least in theory a republican form of government, universal male suffrage and, particularly, anti-clerical policies.\n\nIn German-speaking countries, this current is known as (literally \"free mind\", or \"freethought\"), as in German Freeminded Party from 1884 to 1893, then Eugen Richter's Freeminded People's Party; and the Free Democratic Party of Switzerland.\n\nThe 'Freethinker' parties, located mainly in the Netherlands, Scandinavia and German-speaking countries, included:\n\n\nIn Mediterranean Europe, Radical parties were often labelled 'Democratic' or 'Republican' parties:\n\n\n\nRadicalism had played a pivotal role in the birth and development of parliamentarism and the construction of the modern Serbian state leading to the Yugoslavian unification. The People's Radical Party formed in 1881 was the strongest political party and was in power in the Kingdom of Serbia more than all others together. The 1888 Constitution of the Kingdom of Serbia that defined it as an independent nation and formalised parliamentary democracy was among the most advanced in the entire world due to Radical contribution and it is known as \"The Radical Constitution\". In 1902, a crack had occurred in which the Independent Radical Party left and \"the Olde\" remained in the party, leading the original People's Radical Party to stray far from progressivism and into right-wing nationalism and conservatism. In the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Independent Radicals united with the rest of the Serbian opposition and the liberal and civic groups in the rest of the new country, forming the Yugoslav Democratic Party, while several Republican dissidents formed a Republican Party. The NRS had promoted Serb nationalism and put itself as the defender of Serb national interests. Democrats and Radicals were the dominant political parties, especially since the exclusion of the Communists.\n\nIn Montenegro, a People's Party was formed in 1907 as the country's first political party and remained the largest in the period of country's parliamentary history until the Yugoslavian unification. Later, a True People's Party was formed, which never got widespread popular support and whose bigger part had joined the original NS, but the difference was not ideological and instead was opposition and support of the Crown and sometimes in foreign relations to Serbia (the clubbists were the crown's dissidents and supporters of the people as well as Serbia as a regional power and brotherly ally—the rightists were generally anti-democratic and autocratic monarchist and also distrustful to the Serbian government's acts on the national plan).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2224877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224877", "title": "District Court of New South Wales", "text": "District Court of New South Wales\n\nThe District Court of New South Wales is the intermediate court in the judicial hierarchy of the Australian state of New South Wales. It is a trial court and has an appellate jurisdiction. In addition, the Judges of the Court preside over a range of tribunals. In its criminal jurisdiction, the Court may deal with all serious criminal offences except murder, treason and piracy. The Court's civil jurisdiction is generally limited to claims less than 750,000.\n\nThe District Court has had its current structure since reforms during 1973 which created a single court with a statewide criminal and civil jurisdiction. The Chief Judge of the District Court, since 2014, is the Honourable Justice Derek Price .\n\nBy 1850, the court system in the Colony of New South Wales consisted of:\n\nThe population of NSW increased as a result of the gold rush of 1851 and became more dispersed. Litigation grew as the Colony prospered, and crime was not declining. The Supreme Court began to fall seriously into arrears, and this was not helped by the fact that it did not visit a lot of towns. Courts of Quarter Sessions were also few in number and had no civil jurisdiction. By the mid-1850s there were calls for a revision of the court system, to meet the growing needs of the Colony. As a result, the parliament passed the \"District Courts Act 1858\" (NSW). This Act established District Courts, which divided the Colony into Districts and created a court of record for each district with a civil jurisdiction up to 200, to replace the Courts of Requests. Judges of the District Courts were also appointed as Chairman of any Court of Quarter Sessions or General Sessions, to be held within the limits of that District.\n\nThe purpose of the Act was briefly described as:\nDistrict Courts were established by the Legislature for the purpose of simplifying legal proceedings in the recovery of amounts under £200, and lessening the expenses of attending such proceedings, as well as to relieving the Supreme Court of some portion of the overwhelming civil business which the rapid progress of the colony had lately engendered. The Act providing for the institution of these Courts also extended the jurisdiction of Courts of General and Quarter Sessions of the Peace, and prepared the way for a great increase in their numbers, under the presidency of District Court Judges as Chairmen, whereby criminal proceedings have been much facilitated, especially in the more distant and outlying portions of the country.\n\nThe jurisdiction of the District Courts was increased from time to time. Incremental changes were introduced after World War II. The position of Chairman of the District Court Judges was introduced in 1950 to exercise administrative functions in relation to the courts similar to role of the Chief Justice in the Supreme Court. From 1955 instead of being appointed to a specific district, judges began to be appointed to \"all district courts\".\n\nThe intermediate courts were reformed in 1973 by the \"District Court Act 1973\", which abolished the Courts of Quarter Sessions and each of the District Courts and amalgamated their jurisdictions into a single District Court of New South Wales, with a statewide criminal and civil jurisdiction.\n\nThe District Court deals with a wide range of criminal matters. The only charges that the District Court cannot deal with are murder or treason, which must be dealt with by the Supreme Court. The types of criminal matters dealt with by the District Court include:\n\nIn its civil jurisdiction the Court may deal with all motor accident cases, irrespective of the amount claimed and other claims to a maximum amount of 750,000, although it may deal with matters exceeding this amount if the parties consent. In addition, the Court may deal with equitable claims or demands for recovery of money or damages for amounts not exceeding A$750,000. The Court is also empowered to deal with applications under the \"Property (Relationships) Act\" 1984, the \"Succession Act\" 2006, that involve amounts, or property to the value of, not more than A$250,000.\n\nMost of the work in residual jurisdiction is handled by the Workers Compensation Commission. However, some matters that are handled by the District Court include:\n\nThe District Court has appellate jurisdiction for decisions made by the Local Court of New South Wales and the Children's Court of New South Wales, where a review of both sentencing and convictions may be heard before the Court. Appeals against District Court decisions are made to the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal or the Court of Criminal Appeal.\n\n"}
{"id": "2224879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224879", "title": "Russian Old-Orthodox Church", "text": "Russian Old-Orthodox Church\n\nThe Russian Old Orthodox Church () is an Eastern Orthodox Church of the Old Believers tradition, born of a schism within the Russian Orthodox Church (\"raskol\") during the 17th century (Old Believers). This jurisdiction incorporated those Old Believer groups which refused to accept the authority of Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy, est. 1846 (see Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church). It was also known as Novozybkov Hierarchy (by the name of the city where its chief hierarch resided in 1963–2000). It is considered to be independent of the Eastern Orthodox Communion i.e. it is not recognised by the Patriarch of Constantinople, nor by any of the Orthodox churches in communion with the Patriarch.\n\nFrom 1963 until 2002, the official title of its chief hierarch was \"Archbishop of Novozybkov, Moscow and all Russia\". In 2000, with the move of the Archbishop's residence to Moscow, the toponym Novozybkov was dropped from the title. Since March 2003, the official title of the church leader is \"Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia\". The current head of the Church is Patriarch Alexander (Kalinin; since 9 May 2000, Patriarch since 3 March 2003) .\n\nThe Russian Old Orthodox Church was formed from the groups of Old Believers who insisted on preserving the traditional church structure and hierarchy (as opposed to Bespopovtsy groups), but refused to accept the authority of Metropolitan Amvrosii (Popovitch) who converted in 1846 and founded the Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy, due to some canonical problems with his conversion and the ordination of its second bishop, Kiril (Amvrosii ordained him alone, which was against canons). \nThese Old Believers groups continued to exist without a bishop until 1923 when they created their own hierarchy, by receiving the Renovationist Archbishop Nikola (Pozdnev) of Saratov (1853–1934). He was received (like Amvrosii in 1846) by chrismation on November 4, 1923 and given a title \"Archbishop of Moscow, Saratov and all old Orthodox Christians of Russia\". Some problems with Nikola's installation and with the 'validity' of this jurisdiction in general was that the Renovationist Church was a schism from the Russian Orthodox Church and archbishop Nikola, together with other Renovationist clergy was officially suspended from all priestly functions by the Council of Bishops under Patriarch Tikhon (Bellavin) in 1923. Also, some Old Believers had doubts whether Nikola was baptized by infusion rather than triple immersion (see Baptism). These doubts were rejected by the Moscow Council of the Old-Orthodox Church in May 1924.\n\nIn order to avoid the same \"error\" which they thought the leaders of the Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy had made, Archbishop Nikola did not ordain any new bishops single handedly – not until the conversion of another bishop from the Russian Orthodox Church, Stephan (Rastorguev), in September 1929. Four more bishops were ordained in subsequent years. Like many other Christian Churches in Soviet Russia, the Old-Orthodox Church suffered heavy persecution from atheistic authorities. One of the outcomes of these conditions was the frequent migration of the see of its first hierarch: Moscow (1924–1955); Kuibyshev – now Samara (1955–1963); Novozybkov (in Bryansk region) (1963–2000). In 2000, the residence was moved back to Moscow.\n\nIn the 1990s, several bishops separated from the central administration of the Russian Old-Orthodox Church, forming two schismatic ecclesiastical bodies:\nSince the 1990s, some of these schismatic bishops restored communion with the Russian Old-Orthodox Church, but the two churches these schisms created still exist.\n\nIn 2003, in a highly controversial move, the leaders of the Old-Orthodox Church resolved to \"restore\" the patriarchate in the \"Russian Church\", thus setting up a rival Patriarchate of Moscow in opposition to the Patriarch Aleksy II (Ridiger), the head of the Russian Orthodox Church. This act was bound to complicate the relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church and another Old Believer Church claiming to be the authentic Russian hierarchy – the Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy or Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church, and until this day, these three churches are officially not in communion with each other.\n\nThe Holy Council is the highest legislative body, which elects the Patriarch and the members of the Chief Ecclesiastical Council. Today, the Old-Orthodox Church has six hierarchs and about more than 10 parishes on the former Soviet Union territory and four parishes in Romania (as of 1996).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2224881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224881", "title": "Urban planning in Singapore", "text": "Urban planning in Singapore\n\nUrban planning in Singapore has formulated and guided its physical development from the day :Singapore was founded in 1819 as a British colony to the developed, independent country it is today. Urban planning is especially important due to land constraints and its high density.\n\nThe Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is Singapore's national land-use planning authority. URA prepares long term strategic plans, as well as detailed local area plans, for physical development, and then co-ordinates and guides efforts to bring these plans to reality. Prudent land use planning has enabled Singapore to enjoy strong economic growth and social cohesion, and ensures that sufficient land is safeguarded to support continued economic progress and future development.\n\nThe founding of modern Singapore in 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles was arguably a planning event in itself, as it involved the search for a deep, sheltered harbour suitable to establish a pivotal maritime base for British interests in the Far East. The location also needed to keep Britain's maritime trading routes on the East-West axis protected. The British allowed Chinese labourers to migrate in large numbers into the island to make it an immigrant majority country to safeguard their trade in the Far East. The settlers found the waters of Keppel Harbour suitable, and an entourage of eight ships anchored off the mouth of a small river on 28 January 1819. Raffles made landing on the north bank of the river and discovered favourable conditions for the setting up of a colony. The area on the side of the river's north bank was level and firm, but the southern bank was swampy. The settlers found abundant fresh water, and the river itself was a sheltered body of water protected by the curved river mouth. The river was to become the nexus from which the new colony would thrive, and the immediate surrounding areas would form the core of the island's business and civic areas.\n\nUpon its formal establishment with the signing of a treaty on 6 February the same year, Raffles left the settlement, leaving Colonel William Farquhar as the first Resident of Singapore. By the end of May, Raffles returned, and while noting the rapid development of the city, realised the need for a formal urban plan to guide its otherwise disorganised physical expansion. He left the colony again, instructing Farquhar to designate residential, commercial, and governmental land uses for the colony.\n\nWhen he returned more than two years later in October 1822, however, Raffles was dismayed by the way the colony had grown. He therefore formed a Town Committee headed by Lieutenant Philip Jackson to draw up a formal plan for the colony, which came to be known as the Jackson Plan. The plan was the first detailed city plan for Singapore. It laid the groundwork of the city's street and zonal layout, the essence of which continues today. For example, the allocation of civic institutions on the north bank of the Singapore River and the creation of the main commercial area in what was then known as \"Commercial Square\" on the south bank have today evolved into the Civic district and the CBD on either side of the river. The grid-like street patterns continue to exist. While the ethnically segregated residential zones are largely depopulated by now, they continue as the ethnic enclaves Chinatown, Little India, and Kampong Glam, attracting the attention of tourists.\n\nRaffles's foresight and well-intended efforts to maintain orderliness in the city's growth started to spiral out of control just eight years after the Jackson Plan was drawn up. With no updates and no new plans drawn up by the British, the city soon outgrew itself, and the plan soon proved completely inadequate. When Raffles arrived in 1819, the population numbered about 150. By 1911, this figure had mushroomed to 185,000, resulting in severe overcrowding, particularly in the Chinatown area. The road system, planned for travel by foot and horse carts, also could not handle the exploding traffic, particularly when motorised vehicles came to Singapore en masse in the 1910s. The 842 private cars in 1915 had multiplied to 3,506 by 1920.\n\nWith the severe overcrowding in the city centre, the population, particularly the better-off, started to move into the suburbs. The better-off families moved especially to the East Coast, where they often operated plantations and maintained large sea-side homes near the beach at Katong. Several wealthy Muslim families were to leave a legacy in the area through their family names, including those of Aljunied and Eunos. Less well-off families tended to move into the southern parts of the island as a natural extension of the Chinatown area. Subsequently, however, they also moved into other areas, including the East Coast, spreading the problems of overpopulation to the suburbs with the creation of squatters. This growth also resulted in suburban roads becoming congested by traffic, particularly along Geylang Road which leads to the East Coast.\n\nIn 1927, the colonial government attempted to arrest the situation by setting up the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT), with the main aims of alleviating urban congestion and the provision and upgrading of public infrastructure, particularly in the widening of roads to accommodate rising and modernising traffic. Their efforts were evident only in localised areas, as the body did not have the legislative power to produce comprehensive plans or to control urban development. The Second World War also disrupted their efforts during the Japanese occupation from 1941 to 1945.\n\nSingapore emerged from the war in physical ruins and with a large number of homeless residents. A housing committee was thus formed quickly in 1947, and reported an acute housing shortage facing the city, where the population had already reached a million by 1950. With 25% of the population living in 1% of its land area, and with some shophouses housing over 100 people, the SIT's efforts were clearly inadequate in its attempts to rehouse the population into new multi-story apartment blocks.\n\nThe formation of Housing Department Board (HDB)\n\nThe SIT was replaced by the Housing Department Board (HDB) in 1960. It has been monitoring the whole public housing system, from land acquisition, resettlement, town planning, building design, to allocation and management of the completed units. To meet the housing demand in post independence era, HDB had completed 324000 units in 20 years and provided housing for 68.54% of the whole population . 50 years after the formation of HDB, HDB flats accommodate more than 80% of Singaporeans.\n\nThe significance of public housing in Singapore\n\na) To realise the national agenda of Singapore as a home country\n\nHome ownership was introduced as a national agenda in the 1960s by former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew. He encouraged people to buy public housing from HDB by setting the price lower than the market value to increase home ownership. Home ownership was not only a social agenda to him, but a political strategy at the same time. In his memoirs, he wrote \"…If the soldier's family did not own their home, he would soon conclude he would be fighting to protect the properties of the wealthy. I believed this sense of ownership was vital for our new society which had no deep roots in a common historical experience.\". He believed home ownership would help to develop people's sense of belonging to the country, which in turn achieve political and social stability. In 2016, Singapore remains a top destination for foreign investment in 2016, following United States and China and hence stability can enhance Singapore's attractiveness to overseas investors.\n\nb) Set up the housing ladder\n\nAround 88% of housings in Singapore are public housing built by HDB and 90% of the population own in their home. As HDB is the major housing provider in Singapore, they sell dwelling units to first time home buyer at a concessionary rate to encourage home ownership. People can accrue wealth through capital growth of the dwelling units when the property market grows and this would allow them to upgrade their residence through resale of their units. However, HDB owners cannot resale their units in 5 years to ensure the needs of different groups are met and minimise the interference to the second hand market. Since the property market is tightly controlled by the government by imposing restrictions on the eligibilities of buyers and heavy stamp duties, the price gap between the public housing and private units are not greatly significant and hence it is possible for people to upgrade the residence and thus the living environment. Hence public housing not only realises the national agenda of Singapore as a home country, it also sets up the housing ladder which allows people to improve the living environment.\n\nThere are other housing options are condominium, private flats and landed housing. It is worth mentioning condominiums as some HDB regulations have to be followed, since the land is sold to the developer by the government at prices lower than the market. For example the eligibility of the owner and minimum of occupancy period before resale in the second hand market. (Han, 2005). On the other hand, landed housing value more than other types of housing in the same area due to its scarcity, better design and location. Unlike detached houses in Australia, land in Singapore are leased out rather than sold by the government. Hence when the lease is over, the ownership of the land could be returned to the government if the government decided not to extend the lease. For example, some leased land in Geylang will be expired in 10 years and the government has decided not to renew the lease and that area will be redeveloped into other uses.\n\nc) The core of planning strategy of Singapore\n\nThe planning strategy of Singapore centres on public housing as a considerable number of population live in HDB units. HDB has flexibility and autonomy in planning amenities around public housing, such as public transportation, office, retail and recreational facilities. As Singapore has limited supply of land, it is important that spaces are being utilised efficiently while the living quality of people will not be compromised. A HDB hub provides retail, public transportation and recreational services in a compact area. It serves people living in HDB flats and also serves people living in other types of housing nearby. Thus people can access to the necessities at their door step. It is similar to activity centre in Victoria, but it is planned by HDB rather than the local council. And it shows the significance of public housing and the role of HDB in planning.\n\nThe current policy of Singapore's urban planners who come under the Urban Redevelopment Authority is to create partially self-sufficient towns and districts which are then further served by four regional centres, each of which serves one of the four different regions of Singapore besides the Central Area. These regional centres reduce traffic strain on Singapore's central business district, the Central Area, by replacing some of the commercial functions the Central Area serves.\n\nEach town or district possesses a variety of facilities and amenities allocated strategically to serve as much as possible on at least a basic scale, and on the regional scale, an intermediate one. Any function of the Central Area not served then is allowed by the regional centre to be executed efficiently as the transport routes are planned to link up the regional centres and Central Area effectively. The Housing Development Board works with the Urban Redevelopment Board to develop public housing according to the national urban planning policy.\n\nAs land is scarce in what is the most densely populated country, the goal of urban planners is to maximise use of land efficiently yet comfortably and to serve as many people as possible for a particular function, such as housing or commercial purposes in high rise and high density buildings. Infrastructure, environmental conservation, enough space for water catchment and land for military use are all considerations for national urban planners.\n\nLand reclamation has continued to be used extensively in urban planning, and Singapore has grown at least 100 square kilometres from its original size before 1819 when it was founded. The urban planning policy demands that most buildings being constructed should be high-rise, with exceptions for conservation efforts for heritage or nature. A pleasant side effect is that many residents have pleasant views. Allocating primary functions in concentrated areas prevents land wastage. This is noticeable in Tampines New Town in comparison to the housing blocks found in Dover. Housing blocks turned into complexes, which occupied a large area with thousands of apartments in each one as opposed to smaller high-rise blocks with hundreds. This allows for efficient land use without compromising the standard of living.\n\nSingapore is a small nation with limited resources and land area (719.9 km). There is no other way to meet the economic development without efficient use of land and resources. Since Singapore gained independence in 1965, decentralisation planning strategy has been adopted. Developments were extended all over the nation instead of concentrating in the central area, such as the western area as industrial estates and the north-western area as the recreational space to conserve the nature there. And Singapore's public transport system was designed to link different districts together without heavily relying on roads, to utilise the land efficiently.\n\n\"Public transport network as a strategy to use land efficiently\"\n\nPublic transport network has been integrated with land use through careful co-ordination in physical planning. It is divided into macro and micro level. Macro level is the co-ordination between new towns and major railway network, while the micro level is the co-ordination around major transport hub. In \"World Class Land Transport\" issued by the Singapore government in 1995, it emphasised the integration of high density developments around major transport hub. Public housing estates should be integrated with public transport network, hence residents could access to services around the station within walking distances, or travel by public transportation. For example, at the Sengkang Town Centre Station, developments are built on top or around the station, while public transport network is available to link public housing and the station. A well-coordinated public transportation network provides a viable alternative travel choice to people and hence a major portion of trips could be carried by public transport and occupy a small amount of land. It shows how the Singapore government efficiently uses limited land resources to maximise the outcome.\n\n\"Prioritize railway network over bus network\"\n\nThe Singaporean government has prioritised railway system over bus services as bus services could not be the solution for a compact city like Singapore. The efficiency and quality of bus services will deteriorate quickly once the demand exceeds the certain threshold. For instance, the efficiency of bus service is limited by the capacity of the road and the number of buses available. Since Singapore is a small nation, it is impossible to construct road endlessly to meet up with the demand. Hence there is a hierarchy for public transport network which prioritises the railway network over the bus network. Mass Railway Transit (MRT) is the top tier which serves heavy transit corridors, such as connecting the Central business district to different districts. Light Railway Transit (LRT) is the second tier to support the Mass Railway Transit networks by feeding commuters to the major railway stations. Bus services are to complement the MRT-LRT network and serve the less heavy transit corridor. Thus the railway network can be regarded as the backbone of the public transport network, and supported by the bus services.\n\n\"Improve the current public transport network\"\n\nSingaporean government keeps on improving the current public transport network to enhance public transport a viable choice as alternative to the car for a wider population. The railway coverage area has been expanding since it was introduced in the 1980s. In 2020, four new lines and extensions are scheduled to be complete, which are Thomson Line, The Eastern Region Line, The North-South Line extension and the new Tuas extension. More people will be served by the railway network and they will be able to get to more places. Also, there will be more rides available during morning and evening peak hours to carry the commuters. There will be less crowded trains and a reduction of waiting time during peak hours. These measures aim to increase the catchment area of MRT stations and encourage the usage of the railway network.\n\nApart from improvement on railway network, the quality of bus services is closely monitored by the authority. The two main bus operators: the SBS Transit Ltd and Trans-Island Bus Services (TIBS) will be audited every year to ensure the service and efficiency meet the standard. For example, the commuter load during peak hours should not exceed 100% of the bus designated capacity. If the standards are not met, the contract could be terminated or revised with stricter terms.\n\nIn short, public transport in Singapore aims to carry a maximum number of trips to in small area so land could be utilised more efficiently. As the population is increasing, the network has to be improved to meet the increase in demand and enhance public transport as a viable alternative to car.\n\nPost-independence Singapore government, with the exception of public housing in Chinatown§, has largely shied away from allocating too much housing in the Central Area and especially the Downtown Core, but with increasing density and land reclamation in Marina South and Marina East, there are current plans for new public housing close to the Downtown Core.\n\nSingapore's land is increasingly crowded, and hence the placement of a district of one function that obstructs more infrastructure development in that area (such as building an expressway tunnel or a rail line), as opposed to the placement of a district of a different function that would accommodate future infrastructure, has become increasingly likely. A district of one function could be inefficient if it does not have proper access to another district of another function, or on the other hand, if it is too close. Public amenities have to be strategically placed to benefit the largest number of people possible with minimum redundancy and wastage. A major feature of urban planning in Singapore is to avoid such situations of land wastage.\n\n\n\n"}

This is the only species assigned to the genus Atelocynus.\n\nIt has many names in the local languages where it is endemic, such as: \"cachorro-do-mato-de-orelha-curta\" in Portuguese, \"zorro de oreja corta\" in Spanish, \"nomensarixi\" in the Chiquitano language, and \"uálaca\" in Yucuna. Other names in Spanish are \"zorro ojizarco\", \"zorro sabanero\", \"zorro negro\".\n\nAfter the formation of the Isthmus of Panama in the latter part the Tertiary (about 2.5 million years ago in the Pliocene), canids migrated from North America to the southern continent as part of the Great American Interchange. The short-eared dog's ancestors adapted to life in tropical rainforests, developing the requisite morphological and anatomical features. Apart from its superficial resemblance to the bush dog, the short-eared dog seems not to be closely related to any fox-like or wolf-like canid. It is one of the most unusual canids.\n\nTwo subspecies of this canid are recognized:\n\nThe short-eared dog can be found in the Amazon rainforest region of South America (in Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and possibly Venezuela). There is a single report of \"three slender, doglike animals\" of this species sighted in the Darien region of Panama in 1984 by German biologist Sigi Weisel and a native Embera nation Panamanian; this rare species' presence in Panama is possible because of \"the continuous mass of forest habitat that covers this region\". It lives in various parts of the rainforest environment, preferring areas with little human disturbance. It lives in both lowland forests known as \"Selva Amazónica\" and terra firme forest, as well as in swamp forest, stands of bamboo, and cloud forest. It is a solitary animal and prefers moving in trees away from human and other animal interactions.\n\nThe short-eared dog has short and slender limbs with short and rounded ears. It has a distinctive fox-like muzzle and bushy tail. It ranges from dark to reddish-grey, but can also be nearly navy blue, coffee brown, dark grey, or chestnut-grey to black, and the coat is short, with thick and bristly fur. Its paws are partly webbed, owing to its partly aquatic habitat.\n\nIt moves with feline lightness unparalleled among the other canids. It has a somewhat narrow chest, with dark color variation on the thorax merging to brighter, more reddish tones on the abdominal side of the body.\n\nThis wild dog is mainly a carnivore, with fish, insects, and small mammals making up the majority of its diet. An investigation led in Cocha Cashu Biological Station in Peru into the proportions of different kinds of food in this animal's diet produced the following results: fish 28%, insects 17%, small mammals 13%, various fruits 10%, birds 10%, crabs 10%, frogs 4%, reptiles 3%.\n\nThis species has some unique behaviors not typical to other canids. Females of this species are about one-third larger than males. The excited male sprays a musk produced by the tail glands. It prefers a solitary lifestyle, in forest areas. It avoids humans in the natural environment. Agitated males raise the hairs on their backs.\n\nLifespan and gestation period are unknown, although sexual maturity is assumed to be reached at about a year of age.\n\nFeral dogs pose a prominent threat to the population of short-eared dogs, as they facilitate the spread of diseases such as canine distemper and rabies to the wild population. Humans also contribute to their extermination by degradation of the species' natural habitat and the destruction of tropical rainforests. \n\nThe short-eared dog is currently considered near threatened by IUCN. No comprehensive ecological and genetic research has been carried out on the species.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2224900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224900", "title": "Aradale Mental Hospital", "text": "Aradale Mental Hospital\n\nAradale Mental Hospital was an Australian psychiatric hospital, located in Ararat, a rural city in south-west Victoria, Australia. Originally known as Ararat Lunatic Asylum, Aradale and its two sister asylums at Kew and Beechworth were commissioned to accommodate the growing number of 'lunatics' in the colony of Victoria. Construction began in 1864, and the guardhouses are listed as being built in 1866 though the list of patients extends as far back as the year before (1865). It was closed as an asylum in 1998 and in 2001 became a campus of the Melbourne Polytechnic (Previously known as NMIT) administered \"Melbourne Polytechnic's Ararat Training Centre\".\n\nThe asylum was designed by G. W. Vivian and John James Clark (at this time Vivian's assistant), adapting Vivian's initial designs for a similar buildings in Kew and Beechworth. Building commenced at Kew (Kew Lunatic Asylum), Ararat and Beechworth (Beechworth Asylum) at roughly the same time, however Ararat was completed first. The building of Ararat was contracted to O'Grady, Glynn and O'Callaghan and not patients (or \"inmates\" as they were called) as many erroneously believe. The asylum was built as a town within a town with its own market gardens, orchard, vineyards, piggery and other stock kept on the grounds. At its height it had over 500 staff and as it stands today the complex is made up of 63 buildings ranging in age from the original wings built in the 1860s to the modern forensic unit which was built in 1991 - only two years before the facility closed. Despite being closed as an asylum the facility continued to house female prisoners during the building/renovation of Dame Phyllis Frost Centre right up until its current management took over in 2001.\n\nThe asylum complex is an example of the E-plan barracks type lunatic asylums based on the model 1850s asylum in Colney Hatch, England. Ararat is very similar in design to its sister asylums at Kew and Beechworth, however Ararat's use of linking bridges with an arcade on an arched gateways is unique. Kew is considered to be an example of Second Empire design, whereas Ararat and Beechworth are considered more typically Italianate, though both styles have similar characteristics. The buildings are constructed from oversize bricks, which were then rendered with cement. Two storeyed ward wings extend to each side, one for each sex. The ward wings were surrounded by courtyards lined with iron columned verandas,\n\nAnother distinctive feature of Ararat and other early Victorian asylums is the use of a variation on ha-ha walls around the patients' courtyards. They consisted of a trench, one side of which was vertical and faced with stone or bricks, the other side sloped and turfed. From the inside, the walls presented a tall face to patients, preventing them from escaping, while from outside the walls looked low so as not to suggest imprisonment.\n\nIn 1913 the landscape gardener Hugh Linaker was employed to layout the grounds of Mont Park. As landscape gardener for the State Lunacy Department he commenced a program of landscape improvements and tree plantings at asylums in Victoria. Linaker was already familiar with the area having previously laid out the grounds of Alexandra Park in Ararat. Unfortunately, only a few remnants of the Linaker's plantings remain.\n\nIn December 1886 the old gaol at Ararat was proclaimed as \"J Ward\" of the Ararat Asylum. It was to cater for those persons who were detained in any jail, reformatory or industrial school or other place of confinement who appeared to be insane. The ward was not a separate institution in its own right and has continued to function as a division of the Ararat Mental Hospital. \"J Ward\" was always regarded as a temporary measure.\n\nA new institution was to be built at Sunbury for the retention of the criminally insane. However, when the building was nearing completion it was decided that it would house females only and males would remain at \"J Ward\". In May 1988 the Minister for Health announced that \"J Ward\" was to be closed over the next year.\n\nThe decommissioning of Aradale began in the early 1990s, with patients transferred to community living and to other facilities. After December 1993 the Ararat Forensic Psychiatry Centre was the only remaining ward. In 1997, the remaining patients at AFPC were eventually transferred to Rosanna, until the new Thomas Embling Hospital in Fairfield was completed.\n\nIn 2001 the Victorian Government provided $7.4 million to Melbourne Polytechnic to establish a campus of the Melbourne Polytechnic's Ararat Training Centre on the site of the hospital. 30 hectares of vineyard and 10 hectares of olive grove were planted in 2002 and an olive processing facility and winery were later built on site. The first planting at the Ararat campus was of 28 hectares of vines, which produced the first vintage in 2005. Since commencing training and research at Aradale in 2002, Melbourne Polytechnic also established a 250 tonne winery, a four hectare lavender farm and extensive training facilities. The Polytechnic campus was established to provide in Victoria a world-class wine and hospitality training facility.\n\n"}
{"id": "2224905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224905", "title": "Jamón", "text": "Jamón\n\nJamón (, pl. \"jamones\") is a kind of dry-cured ham produced in Spain. It is one of the most globally recognized food items of the Spanish cuisine (along with other dishes such as Gazpacho and Paella). It is also regularly a component of tapas.\n\nMost \"jamón\" is commonly called \"jamón serrano\" in Spain\".\"\n\n\"Jamón\" is the Spanish word for ham. As such, other ham products produced or consumed in Spanish-speaking countries may also be called by this name.\n\"Jamón\" is typically consumed in slices, either manually carved from a leg on a \"jamonero\" stand using a sharp thin slicing knife, or cut from the deboned meat with a rotatory cold-cut slicer. It's also regularly consumed in any shape in small portions.\n\nAs a product, \"Jamón\" is similar to Portuguese \"presunto\" and to Italian \"prosciutto,\" but the production differs by a longer curing phase (up to 18 months), giving it a dryer texture, deeper color and stronger flavour than the former.\n\nA whole \"Jamón\" leg is considerably cheaper by weight than its sliced counterpart because it includes the bone and non-edible fat. Once the external fat layers are removed and the meat is exposed, though, the product must be consumed as soon as possible since a progressive drying and deteriorating process starts. This is not an issue for restaurateurs and retailers, since they go through product much faster than an individual. Home users will typically choose sliced product, be it freshly cut from a deli stand, commercially pre-packaged or vacuum preserved. \"Jamón\" is safe to consume for as long as is kept in its leg in a dry and cool environment and direct sunlight is avoided, but it must be kept refrigerated once cut away from the leg.\n\n\"Jamón\" may also be smoked in some regions and it is consumed, mostly for personal use. This is common in the southern area of Castile and León as well as parts of Extremadura. Such a \"jamón\" has a harder texture and smoky-salty flavour.\n\nThough widely available (even if on the expensive side) in Spain and accessible in some of the European Union, import duties and trade or food safety restrictions that apply to foreign meat products in international markets may raise substantially the prices while creating a scarcity, often making \"jamón\" a prohibitively costly product to import and offer overseas. \n\nThere are two main commercial labels for \"jamón,\" based on the pig breed and protected designations:\n\n\nThe term jamón serrano (\"serrano ham\", ham from the sierra, or mountain range) is regularly applied as an umbrella culinary term for all dry-cured \"jamón\" produced in Spain, as opposed to \"jamón de York\", which is baked or boiled in salted fluid.\n\nIt is most precisely applied, though, to \"jamón\" produced from white and/or non-\"Ibérico\" breeds of pig. This is the most commonly produced and consumed range of \"jamón\" in Spain. The majority of \"jamones serranos\" are produced from a landrace breed of white pigs or from commercial breeds such as Duroc. \"Jamón serrano\", described variously as jamón reserva, jamón curado, and jamón extra or any generic \"jamón\" nomenclature, is produced from compound-fed white pigs.\n\n\"Jamón serrano\" has TSG (Traditional Specialities Guaranteed) status. The TSG certification attests that a particular food product objectively possesses specific characteristics that differentiate it from all others in its category and that its raw materials, composition, or method of production have been consistent for a minimum of 30 years. \n\nFresh hams are trimmed and cleaned, then stacked and covered with salt for about two weeks to draw off excess moisture and preserve the meat from spoiling. The salt is then washed off and the hams are hung to dry for about six months. Finally, the hams are hung in a cool, dry place for 6 to 18 months, depending on the climate, as well as the size and type of ham being cured. The drying sheds (\"secaderos\") are usually built at higher elevations, which is why the ham is called \"mountain ham\".\n\nPork products made from iberian breed pigs receive the \"ibérico/a\" denomination. As such, jamón ibérico is the dry-cured \"jamón\" produced from livestock of these breeds. \"Ibérico\" encompasses some of the most expensive ham produced in the world, and its fatty marbled texture has made it very popular as a delicacy, with a hard to fulfill global demand comparable to that of kobe beef.\n\nSince \"jamón ibérico\" production and export is limited, buyer should beware and not fall victim of bait-and-switch or quality fraud similar to that of olive oil, since it has been estimated that a sizable portion of both local market and exports are not actually \"ibérico\". Spain regulation defines trade labeling for all \"ibérico\" products.\n\nUnder the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union (EU), certain well-established meat products, including some local \"jamón\" and \"jamón\" producers, are covered by a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) or Protected geographical indication (PGI):\n\n\nThe \"paleta de cerdo\" or \"paletilla\" is a product similar to \"jamón\"; it is made from the front leg of a pig, instead of the hind leg used for \"jamón\", cured using the same process and consumed in the same way. Since whole legs are sold by weight and \"paletillas\" are lighter, they are often marketed towards home consumption.\n\nA \"paletilla\" may be described or marketed as \"Ibérica\" when produced from the same livestock as \"Jamón Ibérico\".\n\n"}

The Cottas were of noble Italian descent, and at the time of the Reformation the family was settled in Eisenach in Thuringia.\n\nJohann Georg Cotta (1631–1692), the founder of the publishing house of J. G. Cotta, married in 1659 the widow of the university bookseller, Philipp Braun, in Tübingen, and took over the management of his business, thus establishing the firm which was subsequently associated with Cotta's name. On his death, in 1692, the undertaking passed to his only son, also name Johann Georg; and on his death in 1712, to the latter's eldest son, also named Johann Georg, while the second son, Johann Friedrich, became a distinguished theologian.\n\nAlthough the eldest son of the third Johann Georg, Christoph Friedrich Cotta (1730–1807), established a printing-house to the court at Stuttgart, the business languished.\n\nIt was reserved to the youngest son of Christoph Friedrich, Johann Friedrich, to restore the fortunes of the firm. Born in Stuttgart, he attended the gymnasium of his native place, and was originally intended to study theology. He, however, entered the university of Tübingen as a student of mathematics and law, and after graduating spent a considerable time in Paris, studying French and natural science, and mixing with distinguished literary men. After practising as an advocate in one of the higher courts, Cotta, in compliance with his father's earnest desire, took over the publishing business at Tübingen. He began in December 1787, and laboured incessantly to acquire familiarity with all the details. From 1793 to 1794, Orell Füssli in Zürich published Marianne Ehrmann's \"Die Einsiedlerinn aus den Alpen\", the first magazine that was published by a women in Switzerland; her early death stopped the further issues. Because the self-publishing could not handle the success of her former magazine, Marianne and her husband agreed on a takeover by Cotta, but in 1793 occurred irreconcilable conflicts; Cotta founded the journal \"Flora\" with the subscriber base, and Marianne Ehrmann continued the magazine \"Einsiedlerinn aus den Alpen\". The house connexions rapidly extended; and, in 1794, the \"Allgemeine Zeitung\", of which Schiller was to be editor, was planned. Schiller was compelled to withdraw on account of his health; but his friendship with Cotta deepened every year, and was a great advantage to the poet and his family. Cotta awakened in Schiller so warm an attachment that, as Heinrich Döring tells us in his life of Schiller (1824), when a bookseller offered him a higher price than Cotta for the copyright of \"Wallenstein\", the poet firmly declined it, replying “Cotta deals honestly with me, and I with him.” In 1795 Schiller and Cotta founded the \"Horen\", a periodical very important to the student of German literature. The poet intended, by means of this work, to infuse higher ideas into the common lives of men, by giving them a nobler human culture, and “to reunite the divided political world under the banner of truth and beauty.” The \"Horen\" brought Goethe and Schiller into intimate relations with each other and with Cotta; and Goethe, while regretting that he had already promised \"Wilhelm Meister\" to another publisher, contributed the \"Unterhaltung deutscher Ausgewanderten\", the \"Roman Elegies\" and a paper on Literary Sansculottism. Fichte sent essays from the first, and the other brilliant German authors of the time were also represented. In 1798 the \"Allgemeine Zeitung\" appeared at Tübingen, being edited first by Posselt and then by Huber. Soon the editorial office of the newspaper was transferred to Stuttgart, in 1803 to Ulm, and in 1810 to Augsburg; it is now in Munich.\n\nIn 1799 Cotta entered on his political career, being sent to Paris by the Württemberg estates as their representative. Here he made friendships which proved very advantageous for the \"Allgemeine\" \"Zeitung\". In 1801 he paid another visit to Paris, also in a political capacity, when he carefully studied Napoleon's policy, and treasured up many hints which were useful to him in his literary undertakings.\n\nHe still, however, devoted most of his attention to his own business, and, for many years, made all the entries into the ledger with his own hand. He relieved the tedium of almost ceaseless toil by pleasant intercourse with literary men. With Schiller, Huber, and Gottlieb Konrad Pfeffel (1736–1809) he was on terms of the warmest friendship; and he was also intimate with Herder, Schelling, Fichte, Richter, Voss, Hebel, Tieck, Therese Huber, Matthisson, the brothers Humboldt, Johann Müller, Spittler and others, whose works he published in whole or in part. In the correspondence of Alexander von Humboldt with Varnhagen von Ense we see the familiar relations in which the former stood to the Cotta family. In 1795 he published the \"Politischen Annalen\" and the \"Jahrbücher der Baukunde\", and in 1798 the \"Damenalmanach\", along with some works of less importance. In 1807 he issued the \"Morgenblatt\", to which Schorn's \"Kunstblatt\" and Menzel's \"Literaturblatt\" were afterwards added.\n\nIn 1810 he removed to Stuttgart; and from that time till his death he was loaded with honours. State affairs and an honourable commission from the German booksellers took him to the Vienna congress; and in 1815 he was deputy-elect at the Württemberg diet. In 1819 he became representative of the nobility; then he succeeded to the offices of member of committee and (1824) vice-president of the Württemberg second chamber. He was also appointed Prussian Geheimrat, and knight of the order of the Württemberg crown; King William I. of Württemberg having already revived the ancient nobility in his family by granting him the patent of Freiherr (Baron) Cotta von Cottendorf . Meanwhile, such publications as the \"Polytechnische Journal\", the \"Hesperus\", the \"Württembergische Jahrbücher\", the \"Hertha\", the \"Ausland\", and the \"Inland\" issued from the press. In 1828–1829 appeared the famous correspondence between Schiller and Goethe. Cotta was an unfailing friend of young struggling men of talent.\n\nIn addition to his high standing as a publisher, he was a man of great practical energy, which flowed into various fields of activity. He was a scientific agriculturist, and promoted many reforms in farming. He was the first Württemberg landholder to abolish serfdom on his estates. In politics he was throughout his life a moderate liberal. In 1824 he set up a steam printing press in Augsburg, and, about the same time, founded a literary institute at Munich. In 1825 he started steamboats, for the first time, on Lake Constance, and introduced them in the following year on the Rhine. In 1828 he was sent to Berlin, on an important commission, by Bavaria and Württemberg, and was there rewarded with orders of distinction at the hands of the three kings. He died, on 29 December 1832 in Stuttgart, leaving a son and a daughter as coheirs.\n\nHis son, Johann Georg, Freiherr Cotta von Cottendorf (1796–1863), succeeded to the management of the business on the death of his father, and was materially assisted by his sister's husband, Freiherr Hermann von Reischach. He greatly extended the connexions of the firm by the purchase, in 1839, of the publishing business of G. J. Göschen in Leipzig, and in 1845 of that of Vogel in Landshut; while, in 1845, “Bible” branches were established at Stuttgart and Munich. He was succeeded by his younger son, Karl, and by his nephew (the son of his sister), Hermann Albert von Reischach. Under their joint partnership, the before-mentioned firms in Leipzig and Landshut, and an artistic establishment in Munich passed into other hands, leaving on the death of Hermann Albert von Reischach, in 1876, Karl von Cotta the sole representative of the firm, until his death in 1888. In 1889 the firm of J. G. Cotta passed by purchase into the hands of Adolf and Paul Kroner, who took others into partnership. In 1899 the business was converted into a limited liability company.\n\nCotta's publishing company survives today, although no longer owned by the family, under the name Klett-Cotta. Its contemporary offerings include German-to-Elvish dictionaries tied into the \"Lord of the Rings\" movies.\n\n"}

They should not be confused with pomors, which were people who inhabited the coast of the White Sea. Pomortsy () was founded in Russian Karelia, by the Vyg River (), by Danila Vikulin and the Denisov brothers. It became an official registered organization in 1909, after the \"Freedom of Religion\" manifesto was published on April 17, 1905, although it existed prior to that. The Pomorian Church saw several splits occur since its inception in 1694, including the Filippians and Fedoseyans who refused to pray for the Czar (моление за царя), and a major split during the 1800s, between Novopomortsy (\"New Pomortsy\"), who recognized marriage, and Staropomortsy (\"Old Pomortsy\"), who did not.\n\nThe Pomorian \"soglasiye\" (, which means \"creed\" or \"confession\") is a group of bespopovtsy (\"priestless\") Old Believers, who abandoned the practice of receiving \"runaway priests\" after the death of the last pre-Raskol (schism) priests of the Russian Orthodox Church. In the absence of the priesthood, they began to elect literate laity to conduct services.\n\nThe Pomorian creed was formed in 1694, when the Vygovsky men’s monastery (Vygovsky obschezhitelstvo) was founded in Pomorye by the Vyg river, which became the spiritual center for the entire creed from the early 17th to the middle 19th century as well as an ideological center for the priestless Old Believers. On the basis of the Solovetsky Monastery rules, the Pomorian service rules for the laity were created without words, which were given by priests.\n\nIn 1706, the Leksinskiy female monastery was founded. The Vygovsky monastery is famous for compiling its “Pomorian Answers,” which became the basis of its religious doctrine. In 1738, some Pomorians had started praying for the Tsar. This provoked a split in their community. Those that have not accepted praying for the Czar (моление за царя) during their services, formed the Filippovskiy (who also practiced self-immolation) and the Fedoseevtsy agreements. These subsequent groups also experienced additional divisions and splits later on.\n\nInitially Pomortsy denied the sanctity of marriage. However, in the early 1830s, the Pomorian community became divided on the issue into Staropomortsy (Old-Pomorians), who continued to deny the sanctity of marriage, and the Novopomortsy (New-Pomorians), who allowed the transfer of property by inheritance and legalized marital relations outside the church marriage. The Novopomortsy also attracted members from other Old Believer groups who are disgruntled with the strict attitude towards marriage.\n\nThe official church registered with the government as a \"church organization\" after the \"Freedom of Religion\" manifesto publication on April 17, 1905. The first All-Russian Pomorian Council was held from May 1–10, 1909, in Moscow, the second in 1912. Local communities of Pomorians also became important economic centers of northern Russia in the early 19th century.\n\nAfter the revolution of 1917, Pomorians outside of Russia have formed organizational centers in their countries of residence.\n\nThe Pomorian Old Orthodox Churches are headed by National Councils and Spiritual Commissions in Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Belarus, and Ukraine. There are also Pomorian parishes in the United States, Brazil, and elsewhere. According to 2001 data, in Lithuania there are over 27,000 Old Believers in 59 officially registered parishes of the Pomorian Church.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His \"chef d'œuvre\" is \"The Crucifixion of St. Peter\" made for the cathedral of Notre Dame. \n\nBourdon was born in Montpellier, France, the son of a Protestant painter on glass. He was apprenticed to a painter in Paris. In spite of his poverty he managed to get to Rome in 1636; there he studied the paintings of Nicolas Poussin, Claude Lorrain and Caravaggio among his eclectic selection of models, until he was forced to flee in 1638, to escape a feared prosecution for his Reformed Protestant faith. \n\nHe lived in Paris from 1637 to 1652.\nIn 1648, Bourdon was one of the founders of the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture and was elected as one of the original twelve elders in charge of its running.\n\nIn 1652 he departed for Sweden and Queen Christina of Sweden made him her first court painter. \n\nBourdon's facility rendered him adept at portraiture, whether in a dashing Rubens manner or in intimate, sympathetic bust-length or half-length portraits isolated against plain backgrounds that set a formula for middle-class portraiture for the rest of the century, landscapes in the manner of Gaspar Dughet or capricci of ruins, mythological \"history painting\" like other members of Poussin's circle or the genre subjects of the Dutch Bamboccianti who were working in Rome. His eclectic range of styles have given art historians exercise in tracing his adaptation of his models, while the lack of an immediately recognizable \"Bourdon style\" has somewhat dampened public appreciation. \n\nBourdon spent most of his working career outside France, where, though he was a founding member of the Académie royale, he was for long largely dismissed as a \"pasticheur\", a situation partly rebalanced by a comprehensive exhibition in 2000 of his work at the Musée Fabre, where the collection includes a fine \"Lamentation\" painted in the last years of his life.\n\nHis success required the establishment of an extensive atelier, where his pupils included Nicolas-Pierre Loir and Pierre Mosnier.

It is a folktale possibly of the Diyala region as the later version seems to feature the god Tišpak as its protagonist and may be an allegory representing his replacement of the chthonic serpent-god Ninazu at the top of the pantheon of the city of Ešnunna. This part is played by Nergal in the earlier version. It was possibly a precursor of the Enûma Eliš, where Labbu, meaning \"Raging One\" or \"lion\", was the prototype of Tiamat and of the Canaanite tale of Baal fighting Yamm.\n\nExtant in two very fragmentary copies, an Old Babylonian and a later Assyrian one from the Library of Ashurbanipal, which have no complete surviving lines, the Labbu Myth relates the tale of a possibly leonine certainly serpentine monster, a fifty-league long \"ba-aš-ma\": Bašmu or sixty-league long :Mušḫuššu, depending on the version and reconstruction of the text. The opening of the Old Babylonian version recalls that of Gilgamesh:\nThe cities sigh, the people...<br> The people decreased in number...<br> For their lamentation there was none to...\n\nThe vast dimensions of Labbu are described. The sea, \"tāmtu\" has given birth to the dragon (line 6). The fragmentary line \"He raises his tail...\" identified him for Neil Forsyth as a precursor of a later Adversary, the dragon of Revelation 12:4, whose tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth.\n\nIn the later version, Labbu is created by the god Enlil who “drew [a picture of] the dragon in the sky\", to wipe out humanity whose raucous noise has been disturbing this deity's sleep, a recurring motif in Babylonian creation epics. Whether this refers to the Milky Way (Heidel 1963) or a comet (Forsyth 1989) is not clear. The pantheon of Babylonian gods are terrified by this apparition and appeal to the moon god Sîn or fertility goddess Aruru who conscripts Tišpak/Nergal to counter this threat and “exercise kingship”, presumably over Ešnunna, as its reward. Tišpak/Nergal raises objections to tangling with the serpent but, after a gap in the narrative, a god whose name is abraded provides guidance on military strategy. A storm erupts and the victor, who may or may not be Tišpak or Nergal, in accordance with the advice given, fires an arrow to slay the beast.\n\nThe epic fragments are not part of a cosmogony, Forsyth notes, as the cities of men already exist. F.A.M. Wiggerman found the myth's function as justifying Tishpak's accession as king, \"as a consequence of his 'liberation' of the nation, sanctioned by the decision of a divine council.\"\n\n"}

In the mid-1970s, they scored UK top-ten hits with the singles \"There's a Whole Lot of Loving\" and \"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\". They found further success in Holland in the late 1970s where they had a number one hit with \"You're My World\".\n\nGuys 'n Dolls were formed in November 1974, after Ammo Productions held auditions for three young men and three young women to perform as a vocal group. The six original members were Paul Griggs, David Van Day, Dominic Grant, Thereza Bazar, Martine Howard, and Julie Forsyth (daughter of Bruce Forsyth).\n\nGuys 'n' Dolls released their first hit single, \"There's a Whole Lot of Loving\", in January 1975. The song was originally recorded in September 1974 by a group of session singers (including Tony Burrows and Clare Torry) for a TV advertisement for McVitie's biscuits. Guys 'n' Dolls were formed to cash in upon the popularity of the jingle and to present it as a single. However the group was not ready in time to record an entirely new version for the single's hasty release and so the voices of the session singers remained on the single. The song became an immediate hit, rising to No.2 in the UK singles chart, launching the group to overnight stardom.\n\nThe following year, the group scored highly again as their cover of \"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\" peaked at No.5. Other singles by the group charted more modestly and they only charted one album, \"Guys 'n Dolls\" released in 1975. In 1977 however, they scored a No.1 hit in both the Netherlands and Belgium with \"You're My World\", launching them on a new phase of their career. \n\nBy mid 1977, Van Day and Bazar were unhappy with the direction of the group and their complaints led to the management asking them to leave. By mutual agreement, publicity at the time showed that leaving the group was their own decision to concentrate on songwriting. The duo, as Dollar, had several hits in the late 1970s and 1980s. Guys 'n' Dolls continued as a quartet, with their third album \"Together\" (1977) depicting just the four remaining members. The group scored a final minor hit in the UK in 1978, and after failing to renew their contract with Magnet Records, they concentrated on their success in Holland, where they continued having hits for the next few years. In late 1978, the group performed as the opening act for Frank Sinatra for a series of London concerts.\n\nIn 1979, the group took part in the contest, hoping to represent the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \"How Do You Mend a Broken Heart?\" Although the show was abandoned due to a BBC strike, the song finished in tenth place of the 12 entries when the judges cast votes on the audio recordings of the songs.\nIn 1980, Forsyth and Grant had their first child together, and Martine Howard and Guys 'n' Dolls' record producer Gerard Stellaard, married and moved to the Netherlands. After marrying, Howard left the group, and was replaced by Forsyth's younger sister, Laura early in 1981. The change was short-lived, as Laura was replaced by Rosie Hetherington, who had previously been a part of the dance troupe Legs & Co.\n\nGuys 'n' Dolls finished as a unit in December 1985, having spent eleven years together. Grant and Forsyth, performed as the duo Grant & Forsyth, and had another five hits in the Netherlands. In 1988, Forsyth wrote the UK's Eurovision Song Contest entry \"Go\" performed by Scott Fitzgerald. Both Forsyth and Grant, together with ex-Jigsaw member Des Dyer, sang backing vocals for the song's performance at the contest in Dublin, Ireland. The song finished second by a margin of one point behind Celine Dion's song for Switzerland, making it the closest ever run contest.\n\nThe original line up of Guys 'n' Dolls (Grant, Forsyth, Griggs, Howard, Van Day and Bazar) reunited for the first time in 31 years for a major television show in the Netherlands in March 2008. This included a number of press and TV interviews.\n\nGriggs has published a book called \"Diary of a Musician\", based on diaries he kept from 1960 onwards. It includes a large in-depth section on the story of Guys 'n' Dolls.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2224965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224965", "title": "Tigre Partido", "text": "Tigre Partido\n\nTigre Partido is a \"partido\" of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, situated in the northern part of Greater Buenos Aires. The department covers a large section of the Paraná Delta and its low-lying islands. The main town of the division is Tigre; other towns include Don Torcuato, El Talar, General Pacheco, Benavídez.\n\nThe partido is bound to the north by the Paraná de las Palmas River, to the northeast by the Río de la Plata, to the southeast by San Fernando Partido, to the south by San Martín Partido, to the southwest by Malvinas Argentinas Partido and to the west by Escobar Partido.\n\nIts total area including the islands is 368 km² and its population was 376,381 as of 2010.\n\nThe current mayor is Julio Cesar Zamora, from the Renewal Front within the Justicialist Party.\n\nThe partido was originally named 'Las Conchas' after a local river (now known as the Reconquista River), but became popularly known as 'Tigre' in the 19th century. Tigre was also the name of a stream and is thought to derive from the \"tigres\" or jaguars seen in the area when it was first settled. In 1952, the name of the partido was officially changed to \"Tigre Partido\".\n\nA port was first built at the mouth of the Las Conchas river, which itself became known as Las Conchas. It served the islands and became an important strategic and smuggling point, targeted by Portuguese, English and Spanish invaders. The partido was officially founded in 1790, but the settlements were hit by floods and the town was moved to the present site of Tigre, at the mouth of the Luján River by 1820.\n\nArgentine author Jorge Luis Borges said about Tigre: \"\"no other city do I know that adjoins a secret group of green islands, which get lost at unknown waters of such a slow river that literature called it frozen...\"\"\nThe history of Tigre dates back to a port on the banks of Las Conchas River, which gave origin to Las Conchas Village. The port was used by the ships sailing the Paraná River to or from Paraguay and also by those who carried wood, coal and firewood from the Delta to Buenos Aires. Las Conchas River (named after the sea shell debris that was abundant in the riverbed) is now called Reconquista and runs along Liniers street.\nThe hamlet surrounding the port grew as its strategic importance increased, mostly since the 18th century. By 1780 a church had already been built and the parish was established at that time.\nMany river rises, floods and heavy rainstorms hit the area. One of the first historically registered catastrophes occurred in early June 1805, when Las Conchas village was almost devastated by a heavy rainstorm that made the river overflow its banks. Most of the people moved to higher nearby lands where San Fernando village was founded, and a channel was built to be used as a new port.\nThe village was deserted and almost completely abandoned. In August 1820 it was destroyed by a tornado once again. The rising floodwaters trapped the port entrance. At the same time the outflow of water came out through a small stream called Tigre, causing the widening of its bed\nand turning it into a river. The port was then moved to its present location by the Tigre River and in time the village was named Tigre.\n\nDuring the second half of the 19th century the area became economically and socially more important, mainly due to Domingo F. Sarmiento, president of Argentina from 1868 to 1872. Sarmiento insisted on the favourable development possibilities of the islands and fought for the rights of settlers to own the land they were working on. His house on the island has been turned into a museum that lies on the bank of the river that bears his name.\nIn those decades the country underwent a significant immigration process and many of those immigrants settled on the islands. The railway line to San Fernando, which arrived in 1863 and reached Tigre in 1865, improved communications with Buenos Aires and eased trade of Delta products, basically fresh fruit and its by-products such as fruit juice, jams and cider.\nLikewise, the train allowed one-day visits by city dwellers. This favoured the setting up of places to spend the day on the islands, called recreos, and aroused interest in rowing along the quiet waters.\n\nThe earliest inhabitants of the islands were indigenous groups called \"guaraníes\". In colonial times there was no stable population but nomadic hunters or firewood and coal seekers. Occasionally, it was also a smuggler's hiding place. From the moment Sarmiento encouraged development, new settlers came to the islands to live of the commercial exploitation of their products.\nConstruction materials from the islands included sun-dried bricks, rush, straw and wood. The simple huts made from these materials were followed by houses made entirely of wood.\n\nThe early inhabitants lived mostly by hunting and fishing and on small palm coconuts (cocos australis). A few tribes sowed corn and peanuts, and grew fruit trees.\nIn colonial times the area supplied Buenos Aires with firewood and coal. Later on, fruit growing prevailed up to 1940.That year a river rise spoiled most plants and the crisis provoked a mass departure of a large part of the population. The emergence of new fruit markets in other regions of the country hindered the recovery of this traditional economy resource.\nOther regional products are wicker baskets and pieces of furniture. The cultivation of osier (salix sp), which is native to European and Asiancold and temperate regions, was proposed by Sarmiento because it can resist floods. Another plant that adapts to floodable lands is New Zealand flax (phormium tenax), which was industrialised as from 1925 and is used in containers, burlap, cords, threads, runners and mats. By the end of the 20th century, the competence with synthetic fibres made New Zealand flax plantations anti-economic. Fishing and coypu breeding are other economic activities that are no longer attractive.\nDevelopments in the area include apiculture, camellia and azalea nurseries, handicrafts and timber. At the Delta Products Market of Tigre, various Delta products are sold.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century islanders became aware of their identity. They shared their common interest and troubles in the Delta journal, founded in 1933 by a Hungarian immigrant called Sandor Mikler. At that time 20,000 people lived on the islands and the population peaked at 40,000 in the following years.\nIn 1936 local producers and entrepreneurs founded an association called \"Consejo de Productores Isleños\" (island producers board) and the following year they declared 31 October to be \"islanders day\". The celebration takes place every year with the attendance of local authorities and neighbours.\nThere was an intense social activities on the islands with weekly meetings at the numerous clubs in the area. Weddings were celebrated either in the coastal villages, such as Campana or San Fernando, or in the island chapels. To facilitate religious service on the islands, a floating church to sail along the rivers was set up. As the service was rather expensive it was discontinued towards 1952. The bell tower is now exhibited at the Police Station in Paraná de las Palmas and Carapachay, as a remembrance of those days.\nA procession by boat was made by the first time in 1923. Even today, this feast is celebrated on 8 December, the Immaculate Conception day. The procession is headed by the image of Virgin Mary on board of a boat of the \"Prefectura Naval Argentina\" (national coast guard) and is followed by all types of boats, big and small, commercial and private, all of them decked out for the event. A lot of spectators applaud the march from the banks of the Lujan River.\n\nRowing was one of the main attractions that fuelled the boom of the area. Rowing practice had started in the south of Buenos Aires and little by little was moved to the Luján river due to the tranquility and beauty of the place.\nPresident Sarmiento was present at the first regatta organised on 8 December 1873. The event was so successful that the existing rowing clubs moved to Tigre, and new ones were founded by members of the various foreign communities residing in Buenos Aires.\nYachting started to be practised in 1883, when the \"Yacht Club Argentino\", whose headquarters were later moved to San Fernando, was founded, and then at the \"Tigre Sailing Club\". The Tigre Hotel, was opened in 1890 on the bank of the Lujan River, and next to it the Tigre Club was opened in 1912. These elegant buildings became meeting places for the social elite of the \"Belle Époque\". The Hotel was demolished in 1940 but the Club is still there today and has been declared a National Historic Monument.\n\nThe Delta Rugby Club is centered in Tigre Partido.\n\nTigre Partido is divided into six divisions or \"localidades\":\n\n\n"}

He was born in Cape Town and spent his early years on Robben Island, where his father was the lighthouse keeper. In 1951, Hurley was appointed Archbishop of Durban and the youngest archbishop in the world at that time.\n\nHurley was an active participant in the Second Vatican Council, which he described as \"the greatest project of adult education ever held in the world\".\n\nAn outspoken opponent of apartheid, as chairman of the Southern African Catholic Bishops' Conference, Hurley drafted the first of the ground-breaking pastoral letters in which the bishops denounced apartheid as \"blasphemy\" and \"intrinsically evil.\" Upon his retirement as archbishop, he served as the Chancellor of the University of Natal.\n\nDenis Hurley was born in Cape Town to Irish parents, spending his early years on Robben Island, where his father was the lighthouse keeper. Educated at St Charles College in Pietermaritzburg, Natal, he joined the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate (OMI) in 1931 and in the following year was sent to Ireland for his novitiate.\n\nIn 1933, Hurley was sent to the Angelicum University (now known as Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas) in Rome to study philosophy and theology. He received the degree Licentiate of Philosophy from the Angelicum in 1936 and started studying at the Gregorian University.\n\nHurley was ordained as a priest in Rome on 9 July 1939 and was awarded his license in Theology in 1940. Later he was appointed curate at Emmanuel Cathedral, Durban, where he stayed until 1943 when he was appointed Superior at Saint Joseph's Scholasticate, then based in Prestbury, Pietermaritzburg. He stayed in this position until 12 December 1946 when, aged 31, was named Vicar Apostolic of Natal and Bishop of Durban. He was the youngest Roman Catholic bishop in the world at that time.\nHe chose as his motto \"Ubi Spiritus, ibi libertas\", which means \"Where the Spirit is, there is liberty\". Hurley was among the first church leaders to denounce apartheid, condemning the policy as an affront to human dignity.\n\nOn 11 January 1951, the Vicariate Apostolic of Natal was elevated to the Archdiocese of Durban and Hurley became archbishop, also the youngest in the world at the time.\n\nIn the following year, Hurley became the first president of the newly established Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference, a post he held until 1961. He was again President of this body from 1981 until 1987. Hurley is remembered for his contribution to the struggle against apartheid, his concern for the poor and his commitment towards a more just and peaceful society. In 1961, he was appointed to the Central Preparatory Commission for the Second Vatican Council.\n\nIn 1961, Hurley was appointed to the Central Preparatory Commission for the Second Vatican Council. He attributed this to Rome having out-of-date information stating he was still President of the Southern African Bishops Conference, when in fact Archbishop Owen McCann was President. At the council itself, Hurley was elected to the Commission for Seminaries, Studies and Catholic Education. During the council, he gave ten speeches and made four written submissions.\n\nDuring the council, Hurley wrote a series of anonymous articles for the South African Catholic weekly newspaper \"The Southern Cross\". In 2001 he wrote a 17-part series of memories of Vatican II for \"The Southern Cross\". In recounting its informal cycle of lectures, workshops and long evenings of debates over dinner with interested members of the clergy and laity, Hurley observed that the presence of so many scholars who had been called to Rome to assist with the work of Vatican II had created \"the greatest project of adult education ever held in the world.\" These articles provided the basis for his posthumously published memoirs of the Council, \"Keeping the Dream Alive\".\n\nHurley was described as \"...an eloquent and forceful preacher, ...mild-mannered and soft-spoken away from the pulpit. He was a man of formidable intellect, so much so that he was held in awe by his clergy.\n\nHurley took a special interest in the active participation of all the baptized in the church’s liturgy, especially the Mass. In 1975, Hurley was elected chair of the International Commission on English in the Liturgy (ICEL), a post to which he was re-elected until 1991. His work with Msgr. Frederick McManus of Catholic University in Washington led to a plan that a number of English speaking conferences would join together to prepare a single text for proposed use all over the world. In 1965 Pope Paul VI named Hurley to the Consilium for the Implementation of the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy. In 1975 as ICEL chairman, he oversaw the completion of the four-volume breviary. Hurley frequently registered his disappointment at the reorganisation of ICEL under the auspices of the newly established Vatican office Vox Clara, as mandated by Pope John Paul II's instruction Liturgiam authenticam.\n\nAccording to Anthony Egan, \"Prohibited during Dutch rule, coolly tolerated by the British, and treated with intense suspicion after the Union of South Africa in 1910, the Church was (unsurprisingly) cautious in challenging apartheid. With the majority of its clergy foreign-born and thus vulnerable to deportation, it was encouraged even by the Vatican to ‘play it safe’ after the 1948 National Party election victory. But Hurley, a white South African by birth, ... thought differently.\"\nHurley was an outspoken opponent of apartheid, and was a driving force in a 1957 declaration by the bishops of South Africa that described apartheid as \"intrinsically evil\". In the late 1970s Hurley held a daily silent protest, standing in front of the central Durban Post Office for a period each day with a placard expressing his opposition to apartheid and the displacement of people from their homes. In 1984 Hurley was charged with contravening the South African police act by publishing information which the government alleged to be untrue about atrocities committed in Namibia by the South African military unit known as Koevoet. He received many death threats and was at times subject to house arrest. On three occasions bombs went off near his residence. The state withdrew the charges later and settled a claim by the Archbishop for damages out of court, paying him R 25,000. Due to his commitment to social justice, the Denis Hurley Peace Institute, an associate body of the Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference, was named in his honour. Hurley also worked to assist young men who for reasons of conscience were opposed to joining the South African military.\n\nA lawsuit, known as The Hurley Case, managed to secure the release of Paddy Kearney, a political opponent of the ruling National Party detained under Section 29 of the Internal Security Act. According to South African law professor Tony Mathews, the case \"Hurley and Another vs the Minister of Law and Order\" became \"the most important civil rights ruling for several decades\" and is still taught in law schools today. Hurley became actively involved, turning up in black communities the day they were due to be forcibly removed. On hearing that children had died shortly after one such removal, Hurley counted their graves and recorded their names and ages. Then he released the details to the press, much to the fury of the state. In response to the weak response of South Africa's churches to apartheid, Hurley founded an ecumenical agency, Diakonia, dedicated to social justice. Hurley said his greatest struggle was convincing South African Roman Catholics that social justice was integral to their faith rather than an optional extra.\nHurley was nicknamed \"Mehl'emamba\" (\"Eyes of the Mamba\") by appreciative Zulus.\n\nHurley played a key role in supporting Chris Hurley (his brother) and Robin Savory in founding Thomas More College. His brother Chris later became the second headmaster of the school. Archbishop Hurley also wrote the school song, \"God Our Maker\". There is a memorial garden dedicated to him located on the school grounds.\n\nOn retiring as Archbishop of Durban in 1992, Hurley became chancellor of the University of Natal from 1993 to 1998. He also served as a parish priest for ten years at Emmanuel Cathedral, Durban, where he had officiated so many years earlier as a curate.\n\nHurley was seen by some as a \"liberal\". Many believe that his respectful and very careful questioning of Humanae Vitae in 1968 made the cardinalate an impossibility.\n\nIn 2002 Hurley retired to write his memoirs. He also spent his time writing letters to \"The Times\" debating the finer points of cricket, and composing the words for new hymns. The final article to be published in his lifetime was a guest editorial in the Christmas 2003 edition of \"The Southern Cross\", headlined \"God's special gift to us\". Hurley died as he was being driven back to the Oblate retirement community in Durban after a celebration of the 50th anniversary of a school at whose dedication he had presided as a young archbishop.\n\nHurley received the following honours during his lifetime:\nAccording to Gerald Shaw writing for \"The Guardian\", \"It was in part due to his sustained moral crusade and that of other churchmen that the transition to democracy, when it came in 1994, was accepted by white people in peace and good order.\"\n\nThe Archdiocese of Durban Archbishop Denis Hurley Memorial Fund was set up in favor of two favorite projects of Archbishop Hurley: Kwa Thintwa School for the Deaf and San Egidio Community Project in Mozambique. There is a bronze statue of Archbishop Hurley at the Kwa Thintwa School, KZN commissioned by the Premier of KwaZulu-Natal, Dr Zweli Mkhize.\n\nThe Denis Hurley Association of is a UK registered charity established in London \"to promote and raise funds for the Denis Hurley Centre in Durban, South Africa\". The Centre is planned as home to about a dozen projects to provide medical care, a soup kitchen, job training, support for people living with HIV/AIDS and in particular will offer assistance to refugees, migrants, who have reached South Africa from afar afield as Somalia, Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n\n"}

Dawn grows impatient with Andrew's state of unconsciousness, but keeps researching at Buffy's request. Buffy asks for a book and her mother hands it to her. Joyce warns her that she needs to rest if she intends to defeat this evil, but Buffy knows the vision isn't real and then Xander wakes her up from her dream. The Ubervamp drags Spike further into a cave where the First has taken on Drusilla's form to watch Spike get tortured.\n\nAt the Summers house, Dawn and Anya secretly try to force Andrew to wake and he does as Buffy walks in the room. They begin to interrogate him again about the First, but he takes some prompting before he's willing to help them. Andrew leads the gang to the school basement where the seal is still exposed on the ground, but no Spike or First Evil to be seen. Although they don't know what the seal did or does, the gang grab shovels and cover it with dirt again. On the way out, Buffy and Dawn run into Principal Wood, also carrying a shovel. Buffy and Dawn try to explain Buffy's surprising recovery from being sick and their own possession of a shovel while the principal explains himself and asks Buffy to return to work soon.\n\nAt the house, Willow begins a spell to find the First, but it doesn't go the way she planned. Explosive bolts send Anya and Buffy flying while Willow is briefly possessed by the First Evil. Xander smashes a bowl used in the spell which breaks the effects and sends Willow crashing. She's fearful of the magic and hurting people and begs Buffy not to let her hurt anyone with magic. Buffy starts to leave to find the First herself, but is surprised to find Giles standing outside her front door. With him are three young girls – Kennedy, Molly and Annabelle – who are potential slayers that he's trying to protect.\n\nGiles informs the whole gang about the First's plans to destroy all slayers-in-training, their watchers and eventually the two active Slayers, Buffy and Faith. He breaks the news that the Council has been completely destroyed along with most of their records, except for the few books and references on the First he stole while there was still time. Giles goes over basic knowledge about the First Evil, explaining that it can only take on the appearance of the dead, but it's incapable of solid form. He informs Buffy that unfortunately, she's the only one strong enough to actually stand a chance of winning against the First. One of the Potentials, Kennedy, objects to the situation and wonders why they're hiding out on the Hellmouth of all places with only one person responsible for all their lives.\n\nIn the cave, the Ubervamp tortures Spike by dunking his head under water while \"Drusilla\" lectures Spike about following the rules. Kennedy helps Willow make the sleeping arrangements around the house and ultimately, Kennedy ends up staying in Willow's room. The girls convene in the kitchen and start eating cookies after Dawn burns the meal she was trying to cook. Buffy and Giles walk and talk together as they search for an entrance to the cave Buffy remembers from the first time she encountered the First and its minions, the Bringers. Buffy unintentionally finds it as she falls through some old planks covering the ground. As she searches the caves, she's viciously attacked by the Ubervamp. She stakes the demon, but it doesn't kill him and he proceeds to beat her up badly. Buffy narrowly manages to escape the cave by climbing out and the vampire is kept at bay by the rising sun.\n\nGiles and Buffy return to the house to find the three potential slayers hanging out in the kitchen. Giles tells them all about the vampire Buffy fought, a Turok-Han. He explains that it's one of a prehistoric race of vampires that is far superior to and feared by the everyday vampires Buffy is used to. At work, Buffy researches \"evil\" on the Internet as Principal Woods stops to check on her. Again, in the cave, Spike is smacked around by the Ubervamp while Drusilla dances about and tries to convince Spike to decide to be on their side of the game. Spike doesn't fall for the mind tricks and earns himself more of a beating from the Ubervamp.\n\nBuffy reviews her wounds as her mother pays her another visit. Joyce talks to Buffy about evil and its constant presence in everyone and about the pressure Buffy's feeling to deal with this evil. She wakes up to find that she's still at work and had been in the middle of a meeting with a student. The student walks off and Principal Wood watches on from his office as a very tired Buffy tries to deal with the stress. Later that evening, the gang prepares for sundown and the potential danger it brings to them. The potential Slayers get weapons while Andrew tries unsuccessfully to convince Buffy and Xander to untie him. As Buffy watches for the sun to set, Giles reminds her that she's the one being depended on and then Molly interrupts, informing them that Annabelle ran off.\n\nThe could-be Slayer runs through the streets of Sunnydale until she's captured by the Ubervamp and quickly killed. Buffy finds them both and is badly injured in a fight with the monster.\n\nThe First in Drusilla's form gets angry with Spike as he continues to refuse to cooperate. A terribly wounded Buffy sits alone at home as she listens to Giles and Willow talk in another room. They worry about Buffy's condition and their ability to fight this thing that seems so much bigger than them all. Buffy finally comes downstairs and gives an inspirational speech about this huge challenge before them that is bigger than any evil they've ever faced. She tells the group that she's more scared than ever, but she's not about to back down now. There's a new plan: they're declaring war on this evil instead of waiting for it to make a move which Buffy says,\"If they want an apocalypse, we'll give em one.\"\n"}

Itacaré has about 27,000 residents. Out of these, approximately 50% live in the rural interior. A mixture of races - Amerindian, black and white - can be seen in the features of the natives, called \"nação grapiúna\", whom Jorge Amado affectionately referred to as \"the captivating people of this land\". The town was founded as a Portuguese colonial settlement, originally called São Jorge dos Ilhéus, in 1532.

In fact the route was not greatly used for its intended purpose. After the war the line was again scheduled to be developed as a strategic route, but this scheme too was never fully implemented.\n\nPassenger services were withdrawn from most of the line in 1967, and only the Bletchley–Bedford section remained open for passenger traffic.\n\nIn 1987, the section between Oxford and Bicester was reopened, followed in 2015 by a connection to the Chiltern Main Line at Bicester, enabling Chiltern Railways to operate an Oxford to London passenger service. There are funded plans for the entire line to be re-established by the \"mid 2020s\" (partly on a new route) under a new name East West Rail.\n\nThe Oxford to Cambridge line, when completed, ran broadly west to east. In the early days there were five intersecting trunk lines running south to north:\n\nTwo other trunk routes, the Great Western Railway's Bicester cut-off and the Great Central Railway main line, were built later. Although a continuous line from Oxford to Cambridge was proposed from time to time, it was actually built by local schemes.\n\nFrom west to east, these were:\n\nIn time, these sections were all incorporated into the London and North Western Railway.\n\nThe London and Birmingham Railway opened on 9 April 1838 as far north as Denbigh Hall, about a mile north of Bletchley (which was then a minor village). Initially, passengers alighted here to take a stagecoach on Watling Street to during construction work on the intervening section, which opened on 17 September 1838, and this temporary terminus was closed. Subsequently and for a time, (a few miles further north and on the main road between Oxford and Cambridge via Buckingham and Bedford) took over as an important stop on the line, as a point where engines were changed over and passengers rested.\n\nIn 1836, proposals were put forward to build a line from Cambridge to join the L&BR (still under construction) at Bletchley; the line would have passed through Bedford, but the scheme was not taken forward. The obvious enhancement to the prosperity of Aylesbury following that town's connection to the L&BR changed attitudes, and as time passed, Bedford business interests sought a connection to the main line railway. In 1844 George Stephenson visited Bedford to discuss the matter. At a meeting on 23 April 1844 he set out his proposed scheme, for a line to Bedford joining the L&BR main line at Bletchley. Some opinions had preferred Wolverton as the junction, since Bletchley was not then a settlement of any significance.\nA prospectus for the Bedford and London & Birmingham Railway was prepared; the capital was to be £125,000.\nOn 16 July 1846 the London and Birmingham Railway amalgamated with others, and formed the London and North Western Railway. A proposed extension of the Bedford line on to Cambridge through Hitchin was submitted to Parliament in the 1846 session but failed standing orders. \nThe line to Bedford opened on 17 November 1846, when a ceremonial opening took 600 persons from Bedford to Bletchley in a special train. The new line had a connection to the River Great Ouse at Bedford, trailing from the Bletchley direction. The Bedford station was not yet ready at the time of opening. The commercial benefit to Bedford, already well served by coastal water-borne commerce over the River Great Ouse, is indicated by the immediate fall of coal prices, from 1s 9d to 11d per cwt.\nThere were four passenger trains each way, Sunday excepted, but this was soon enhanced to five each way, one of which was limited-stop, and two Sunday trains.\nImmediately on opening the Bedford Railway was absorbed into the London and North Western Railway. The terms were 4% per annum on the capital, plus half of any surplus. The LNWR had subscribed 1,522 of the 2,500 shares.\n\nThe Oxford and Bletchley Junction Railway and the Buckingham and Brackley Junction Railway had both been authorised in 1846, and before construction the two schemes were amalgamated to form the Buckinghamshire Railway, authorised by Act of Parliament on 22 July 1847. The new company would form a Y shape from Bletchley to both Oxford and Banbury. The 1847 powers also included an extension to Banbury, connecting to the Oxford and Rugby Railway there. and a southward extension from Verney Junction to join the Aylesbury branch. The scheme was encouraged by the London and North Western Railway, which wished to block northward encroachment from the Great Western Railway, whose area of influence at the time was further south.\n\nThe junction that became Verney Junction was known at first as Claydon Junction; the name Verney Junction was given to the station that was later established there. When the World War II link from the Great Central Railway main line was made, the junction there was called Claydon LNE Junction to emphasise the distinction.\n\nFollowing authorisation of the Buckinghamshire company, the directors determined on 10 November 1847 to press ahead with the Banbury line in preference to the Oxford line. Work started on the last day of 1847. The line opened from Bletchley to Banbury on 1 May 1850 for passenger traffic, and goods trains started on 15 May 1850.\nOpening of the Oxford line (from Claydon Junction, at first as a single track only) followed relatively swiftly: to Islip on 1 October 1850; on to Oxford Road on 2 December 1850. This station was at the crossing of the present-day A4165 road, and therefore near to the modern Oxford Parkway station. Horse omnibuses and carts connected the station with Oxford itself. The line was extended to the company's own station at Oxford on 20 May 1851. It was a single track west of Claydon Junction.\n\nThe 1853 passenger timetable shows 4 trains each way daily except Sundays, the first trains each way divided and joined Buckingham portions at Winslow. The journey time Oxford to Bletchley was 75 minutes and a typical journey Oxford to London took about 2 hours 45 minutes.\n\nThe company had its own station at Oxford. It was fortunate in finding a site: Rewley Abbey had long since fallen into ruins, and the site was made available. Approaching trains crossed a swing bridge over the Sheepwash Channel to reach it. The junction with Oxford and Rugby Railway at Banbury was not made by the company, and the southwards extension from Verney was abandoned for the time being.\n\nThe LNWR provided more than half the capital and worked the line from the beginning, and leased it for 999 years from 1 July 1851 guaranteeing a 4% dividend to the other shareholders. The LNWR absorbed the Buckinghamshire Railway company on 21 July 1879.\nEarly in 1854 the line from Verney Junction to Oxford was doubled, completing double track along the full length of the line. Verney was a junction, but no station was built until 1868, prompted by the construction of the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway.\n\nThe Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway was authorised as a broad gauge line on 4 August 1845. Its line was to be 89 miles in length, connecting to the Great Western Railway at Wolvercot Junction, just north of Oxford. The cost of the line was heavy, and the estimates fell considerably short, so that the company was constantly short of funds during the construction period. For some time it concentrated its resources on the northern part of the authorised line.\n\nAlthough the OW&WR had originally been expected to be an ally of the GWR, the friendly relations cooled, and the London and North Western Railway (as owner of the Oxford to Bletchley line) developed good relations with the OW&WR. The LNWR tried to negotiate a takeover of the OW&WR, but this was rejected in Parliament; and in 1852 a direct connection between the LNWR Bletchley line and the OW&WR was also thrown out. In 1853 however the proposed connection (later known as the Yarnton Spur) was approved, and on 4 June 1853 the OW&WR had opened its line as far as Wolvercot Junction, its southern extremity.\n\nThe Yarnton Spur was a short double-track line, in length, from Oxford Road Junction to Yarnton, and it was opened on 1 April 1854. The LNWR at once started operating through passenger services between Euston and Wolverhampton, via Bletchley, Yarnton Spur and the OW&WR. The trains were worked by the LNWR as far as Hanborough, and also from Dudley to Wolverhampton LNWR station via the South Staffordshire curve at Tipton.\n\nThe Buckinghamshire Railway connection at Bletchley left in a southward direction, and a west to south chord was brought into use there in October 1854 to permit direct running between Euston and the Buckinghamshire line.\n\nA west to south curve to the Yarnton Spur was opened, allowing direct access from the OW&WR line to the LNWR Oxford station; this was used chiefly for goods traffic, but in the autumn of 1857 local passenger trains used it during a period of exceptionally strained relations between the OW&WR and the GWR.\n\nThe service to London over the LNWR ceased by 1 September 1861; the west to south curve at Yarnton was reduced to a through siding only shortly afterwards, and the west to south curve at Bletchley was closed and lifted in 1864. Nevertheless, the goods and mineral traffic from the OW&WR line remained considerable; Lawrence, writing in 1910, said that, \"In March last, no fewer than 7,500 coal trucks made use of the loop.\"\n\nThere was a junction but no station at Verney Junction until 1868, when the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway completed their line from Aylesbury to Verney. The Great Western Railway worked the A&BR trains until the company was absorbed by the Metropolitan Railway in 1891, becoming the northern terminus of the Metropolitan Railway. Two Pullman cars worked to Baker Street daily.\n\nThe Oxford to Cambridge line crossed under the Midland main line, and there were two separate passenger stations. In November 1855 officers of the Midland Railway and the LNWR met to consider the construction of a joint station at Bedford. It would have been a little to the west of the contemporary LNWR station. The scheme was agreed to be desirable and feasible, but the Midland Railway board declined to approve it, and it foundered.\n\nThe Great Northern Railway had opened its line from London to Peterborough on 7 June 1850, ultimately giving access to York, and running through Sandy.\n\nThe Sandy and Potton Railway was planned by Captain Sir William Peel. He had settled in Potton, and conceived a railway running almost entirely over his own lands, connecting with the Great Northern Railway at Sandy. His objective was purely altruistic. The length of the line was miles, and an opening ceremony was held in June 1857. The line opened to public goods traffic on 23 June 1857. A Board of Trade inspection took place on 5 November 1857, and this was successful, enabling opening of the line to passengers on 9 November 1857. Peel acquired a locomotive for the line from George England and Co. of Hatcham; it was named \"Shannon\", after the frigate commanded by Peel. A locomotive was hired from the GNR on one or two occasions, and passenger rolling stock was supplied by the GNR. The line had cost £15,000 to build.\n\nThe GNR had allowed Captain Peel to terminate his line in their Sandy goods yard, on condition that he would remove his works if the GNR required the site. Captain Peel died in April 1858 in Cawnpore (now Kanpur), India.\n\nIn 1859 the Cambridge aspirations of several railway companies were competing for Parliamentary approval. A proposed Bedford, Potton and Cambridge Railway was thrown out, but the reverse showed that an alliance with the Great Northern Railway might prove fruitful.\n\nIn the 1860 session of Parliament, the Bedford and Cambridge Railway (as it now styled itself) got the Royal Assent on 6 August 1860. The Great Northern Railway hoped to build from Shepreth to this new line near Lords Bridge and gain access to Cambridge, by-passing the hostile, and even spiteful, Eastern Counties Railway.\n\nThe Bedford and Cambridge Railway was to take over the Sandy and Potton Railway and use its alignment. The route chosen entered the southern extremity of Cambridge alongside the Eastern Counties route from London, at Cambridge being permitted to use a platform at the ECR station. There was to be a separate LNWR goods station west of Hills Road.\n\nIn fact the construction significantly overran cost estimates, and the company had to confer with the LNWR (as prospective lessee) about how to raise the extra cash. The authorised capital had been £240,000, and this had never fully been subscribed, and after opening the estimated cost to complete had risen to £370,175. This at last proved to be accurate. There was acrimony between the companies, but the LNWR underwrote the extra capital, and after considerable further negotiation, the LNWR absorbed the Bedford and Cambridge Railway Company by a share conversion, equating to 4% on the £240,000 original capital.\n\nIt opened on 7 July 1862 for passengers, and for goods in October 1862. The Sandy and Potton Railway had been purchased for £20,000. On 1 July 1862 the Eastern Counties Railway was restructured into the Great Eastern Railway.\n\nThe May 1864 working timetable shows four passenger trains running throughout from Cambridge to Bletchley, and one early train from Bedford to Bletchley, and three goods trains. One Sunday passenger train is shown. Most of the passenger trains appear to continue to Oxford and London, probably by through coach attached to other trains.\n\nWorking arrangements were made with the LNWR, authorised by Act of 23 June 1864. The company was absorbed by the LNWR on 5 July 1865.\n\nThe line as constructed was single; double track was later constructed between Sandy and Gamlingay on 20 October 1870, and on to Cambridge on 10 July 1871.\n\nThe Midland Railway's London extension opened in 1857, at this stage to Hitchin. It crossed the LNWR line at Bedford by a (nearly) 90-degree flat crossing; although it was undesirable, it was considered an appropriate economy measure as compared with a bridge crossing.\n\nOn 12 March 1875 a collision took place at the location, as an LNWR train was struck by a Midland train. The signals protecting the crossing were not of a modern description; the LNWR train started from the station and approached the crossing, fouling it against the stop signal at danger. One passenger died of injuries, and six persons were injured.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, railways sought lower-cost methods of operating passenger trains. The LNWR experimented with a steam railmotor. This was a single passenger coach, designed at Wolverton, with a small integrated steam locomotive. A railmotor was brought to Oxford for trials with a service to Bicester. However, during a trial run on 5 October 1905 the vehicle developed a hot axlebox, and the opening was deferred to the 9th. It was found to be capable of a top speed of 45 mph, and was timed for 30 minutes for the twelve miles to Bicester.\n\nThe vehicle had seats for 48 passengers in two saloons, smoking and non-smoking; the transverse seating had reversible backs, to allow passengers to face the direction in which they were going. They were considered by users to be very comfortable at the time. Woodwork was framed teak and the coach was lit electrically. Alighting and departing the vehicle at the ground level platforms of the halts was effected by a set of steps that swung out from the body of the vehicle. The steps were interlocked with the brakes. In 1905 there were six workings between Oxford and Bicester, with one additional on Thursday and Saturday, in each direction.\n\nTo facilitate the new service a number of small timber platform halts were built. The halts were unstaffed, as tickets were issued by a Conductor on the train. The first was Summertown Halt, opened on 20 August 1906; by the following January the name had been changed to Port Meadow. The remainder of the halts were opened on 9 October 1905.\n\nFrom 1 December 1905 a steam railmotor was operated between Bedford and Bletchley also, and several new halts were opened here too. There were three vehicles, one being kept as a maintenance spare. \n\nThe six halts were closed from 1 January 1917 because of the war, and reopened on 5 May 1919. The railmotors had limitations: they were underpowered and had limited accommodation, and suffered from reliability problems. They were replaced by auto trains about 1921; in this type of train, a conventional locomotive operated with a coach, specially adapted for the driver to control the train when being propelled from the coach. The auto trains and the halts west of Bicester were finally withdrawn during the General Strike on 25 October 1926; competition from road omnibuses had led to seriously declining usage.\n\nFurther east, the system continued: in 1959, the auto-trains were replaced by diesel multiple units, and at this time the remaining stopping points were given raised platforms.\n\nThe railmotor halts were, from Oxford to Islip: Summertown Halt, soon to be renamed Port Meadow; Wolvercote; Oxford Road, and between Islip and Bicester: Oddington, Charlton and Wendlebury Halt near Bicester. The eastern section halts were Bow Brickhill, Aspley Guise, Husborne Crawley, Wootton Pillinge, Wootton Broadmead, Kempston Hardwick, and Kempston & Elstow.\n\nAt the beginning of 1923, the main line railways of Great Britain were \"grouped\" into one or other of four new, large companies, in compliance with the Railways Act 1921. The LNWR and the Midland Railway were constituents of the new London Midland and Scottish Railway. The Great Western Railway absorbed a number of other concerns and continued under the same name. The Great Northern Railway and the Great Eastern Railway were constituents of the new London and North Eastern Railway.\n\nThe whole of the Oxford to Cambridge line was thus part of the new LMS. In the 1930s, the major railways adopted a novel form of collaboration in the interest of reducing operating expenses. In 1934 the Stationmaster of the GWR's Oxford General station took over the management of the LMS's Rewley Road station. Cartage lorries in Oxford carried the initials of both companies.\n\nIn 1931, the Michelin Tyre Company was trying to market an internal combustion (petrol) railcar, which it named the Micheline. It was a ten-wheel articulated vehicle, with pneumatic rubber tyres. It was tried on the line in 1932. Carrying only 24 passengers and with uncertain reliability, it had many of the disadvantages of the steam railmotors, and the trial did not lead to adoption of the system.\n\nOn 12 September 1938, a new diesel railcar design started work on the line. It was a three-car articulated unit, powered by six 125 hp diesel engines; the design was stylish and futuristic, and included central control of sliding passenger doors by the guard. The train was designed at Derby LMS.\n\nThree journeys throughout the Oxford to Cambridge line were undertaken daily, with some short fill-in trips. The journey time Oxford to Cambridge, with three stops, (Bletchley, Bedford and Sandy) was 1 hour 45 minutes, comparing favourably with the 3 hour steam train journey. The runs were not advertised in the ordinary timetables, but only by handbills locally.\n\nThe outbreak of World War II prevented further development of this experimental system.\n\nIn September 1939, war on Germany was declared by the United Kingdom. Aerial bombardment of UK cities and industrial sites was expected, and it was considered essential to create a trunk route for goods traffic avoiding London, which was expected to be the principal target of bombing. The Cambridge to Oxford route was selected to be the core of this route, because of its intersections with several trunk routes. Where existing connections between railways on the route were inadequate, relatively simple enhancements would resolve the difficulty.\n\nWragg describes the situation:\nThe solution was to build what amounted to a railway by-pass of London. Of necessity this was some distance from the capital, both to avoid disruption from heavy air raids, and also to utilise existing lines as far as possible. The start of this massive loop was the old London and North Western line from Cambridge to Oxford…\n\nThere were good existing connections in and out of this line at Bedford and Bletchley, but at Sandy and at Oxford time-consuming shunting movements would be necessary, so here again new connections were hastily installed and opened during 1940. There was no link at all at Calvert so a completely new link was created.\n\nSo in November 1940 Oxford North Junction was created, enabling through running from the Bletchley line towards Oxford GWR station.\nA south-to-east chord line was constructed at Claydon across an area called Shepherd's Furze, connecting the former Great Central Main Line with the line from Bletchley. This link proved a useful connection in addition to its emergency value, and it saw much traffic during the war. \n\nAt Bletchley, the old west-to-south curve, removed in 1864, was reinstated, opening on 31 August 1942. . The Bicester Military Railway was built; it served a very large depot for ordnance and equipment. The civilian railway authorities protested at the adverse impact the railway movements to and from the depot would have on the ordinary war effort of the LNWR line, and the Ministry of War Transport agreed to the building of a new 660 wagon capacity yard at Swanbourne, about miles west of Bletchley.\n\nThe Railway Executive also constructed a west-to-north connection at Sandy; it opened in 1942. However it did not prove to have a strategic value in peacetime and was removed after the war.\n\nCrump explains the strategic significance:\nThe combined length of [the Sandy and Claydon curves] cannot have been much more than a mile, but in conjunction with a link joining the Great Western and Southern lines at Staines they provided a route for trains from the Great Northern to run via Sandy, Bletchley, Calvert, High Wycombe, Greenford and Staines on to the Southern. This route would have been of the utmost use if the London junctions had been destroyed. Actually it was only used on a few occasions, and the operating difficulties were considerable.\n\nIn the late 1930s, a site at Bicester was selected for a large Ordnance Depot to be road and rail served. Construction of the Depot began in July 1940. The railway part of the site would start from a junction with the Oxford to Bletchley line and encircle the two hills of Graven Hill and Arncott. By the end of 1941 the exchange sidings had been laid, and in 1942 the first troop train entered the depot from Bicester station. The site was heavily used during the war, particularly in the preparations for D-Day.\n\nSince the war, the site has been retained as a base for the Royal Logistic Corps. At its peak there were about 40 single-track miles of layout within the depot.\n\nThe Oxford connection was useful in peacetime and was retained. The same is true of the Claydon curve, which provided a useful route for certain freight flows, and for empty passenger stock moves. The Bicester and Sandy connections proved less useful, and were removed.\n\nThe main line railways of Great Britain were taken into state ownership at the beginning of 1948, pursuant to the Transport Act 1948. The entire line was in the London Midland Region of British Railways at first, but in 1951 the section from just east of Bicester to Oxford was transferred to the Western Region.\n\nThe operation of two passenger stations at Oxford was obviously wasteful and the wartime connection allowed trains from the Bletchley direction to run directly into the GWR's Oxford General station.\n\nIn October 1951, a complete transfer of passenger operation at Oxford into this (former GWR) station, now named simply Oxford railway station, took place. Most goods workings were transferred to the former GWR Hinksey yard, and Rewley Road station handled only coal and some general goods traffic.\n\nIn the first years of British Railways, the organisation was beset with falling demand as costs increased. In 1955 a report, \"The Modernisation and Re-equipment of British Railways,\" was published. £1.2 billion would be spent on the project. Subsidiary reports recommended the development of the Oxford to Cambridge line as part of an outer freight ring route from Cambridge to Ashford (Kent) via Oxford, Reading and Tonbridge, keeping freight flows away from London. The cost was to be £15 million. A large marshalling yard was to be built at Swanbourne, and a flyover at Bletchley.\n\nWork on the Swanbourne yard and the Bletchley viaduct started in September 1958. The viaduct was ready in 1962 (it had cost £1.5 million) but work was halted on the marshalling yard.\n\nGerard Fiennes was Chief Operating Officer, British Railways, at the time and wrote that he was convinced marshalling yards should be built in the areas of production and consumption, and not, like Swanbourne, in greenfield sites:\n\nI did stop Swanbourne, Brookthorpe and Walcot [two other green field proposals]. The Bletchley flyover remains as a memorial to those who failed to see that railways must live by concentration and not dispersal. We had … driven … a pretty big nail into Swanbourne’s coffin by refusing to put into it any East Coast traffic. From that moment the writing was on the wall. Swanbourne should have been stopped then.\n\nIf development of passenger business on the line had been envisaged in 1955, that too was suddenly reversed, and in 1959 closure of the entire route was considered. However the introduction of diesel multiple unit passenger trains in that year substantially reduced operating costs, and the closure idea was rescinded. In the Beeching Report of 1963, retention of the line was recommended, with only minor curtailment, but in December 1963 closure was once again put forward, as income was only a little over half of operating expenses. Closure was approved, and most local freight facilities were withdrawn on 18 April 1966. \n\nFollowing public protest, passenger operation on the central section between Bedford and Bletchley was retained; delay in arranging substitute bus services resulted in the passenger closure of the remainder being deferred to 1 January 1968. The line from Bedford (Goldington Power Station) to the junction at Cambridge was closed completely; the wartime marshalling yard at Swanbourne was closed in March 1967.\n\nThe Buckingham branch closed to passengers on 7 September 1964 and to goods on 5 December 1966.\n\nOn 7 October 1973, the line from Bicester to Oxford was reduced to single track. Following that time, for some years the chief use of the line was as a connection from Aylesbury via Claydon LNE Junction to Bletchley for stone trains, refuse trains from the Bristol area, and empty passenger stock movements.\n\nAlthough the story of the original Varsity Line ends in 1967, parts of the route continued as the Oxford–Bicester line and the Marston Vale line. Beginning in 2015, work to revitalise and renew the route began; it hoped that by the end of the 2020s the two university cities will be connected by rail again as the East West Rail link.\n\n\n\n\n"}

His biggest hits include \"On and On\", \"It Might Be You\" and \"Save It for a Rainy Day\". He has appeared in and contributed musically to many motion pictures, including \"National Lampoon's Animal House\".\n\nBishop was born and raised in San Diego, California, and attended Will C. Crawford High School. Originally a clarinetist, he persuaded his brother to buy him a guitar after seeing the Beatles on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". In 1967, he formed his first group, the Weeds, a British Invasion-styled band.\n\nAfter the Weeds folded, Bishop moved to Los Angeles in search of a solo recording contract. During a lean eight-year period, where he was rejected \"by nearly every label and producer,\" he continued to write songs, eventually landing a $50-a-week job with a publishing house.\n\nBishop's break came when a friend, Leah Kunkel, gave Art Garfunkel one of Bishop's demo tapes. Garfunkel chose two of his songs, \"Looking for the Right One\" and \"The Same Old Tears on a New Background\", to record for the platinum album \"Breakaway\". Via Garfunkel's patronage, Bishop finally secured a recording contract with ABC Records in 1976.\n\nBishop's first album, \"Careless\", included two of his biggest hits. The first single released, \"Save It for a Rainy Day\", introduced Bishop to the listening public and went to number 22 on the \"Billboard\" singles chart. The next single, Bishop's highest charting to date, \"On and On\", peaked at No. 11. The album itself rose to number 34 on the \"Billboard\" albums chart. Eric Clapton, Art Garfunkel and Chaka Khan all contributed their talents to the album.\n\n\"Careless\" went gold, as did Bishop's subsequent album \"Bish\", released in 1978. \"Bish\" included one charting single, \"Everybody Needs Love\", which made it to number 32. The album also includes a smooth classic called \"A Fool At Heart\" that features Chaka Khan and Natalie Cole on background vocals. Bishop's third album, \"Red Cab to Manhattan\", released in 1980, failed to chart and was his last released in North America for nine years.\n\nBishop has written and performed music for many motion pictures. In 1978, he contributed the original song \"Dream Girl\" and theme to \"National Lampoon's Animal House\", which he sang in falsetto. In 1980, Bishop contributed backing vocals to \"This Must Be Love\", from Phil Collins' debut solo album \"Face Value\". Bishop's next hit, charting at number 25 in 1982, was \"It Might Be You\", the theme from the movie \"Tootsie\", unusual in that it was not penned by Bishop. Written by Dave Grusin, Alan Bergman, and Marilyn Bergman, it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song.\n\nBishop's composition \"Separate Lives\", sung by Phil Collins and Marilyn Martin, from the 1985 movie \"White Nights\", was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, losing to \"Say You, Say Me\" from the same film. Bishop wrote the song about his breakup with actress Karen Allen, who also appeared in \"Animal House\". Bishop said: \"I write much better when I'm heartbroken and sad or melancholy.\"\n\nOther movie music includes: \"Somewhere in Between\" (written and performed) from \"The China Syndrome\" (1979), \"Your Precious Love\" (performed with Yvonne Elliman) from \"Roadie\" (1980), \"If Love Takes You Away\" (written and performed) from \"Summer Lovers\" (1982), \"Unfaithfully Yours (One Love)\" (written and performed) from \"Unfaithfully Yours\" (1984), \"Something New in My Life\" (performed) from \"Micki & Maude\" (1984), \"The Heart Is So Willing\" (performed) from \"The Money Pit\" (1986), \"All I Want\" (performed) from \"All I Want for Christmas\" (1991), and \"You Can Do Anything\" (written and performed by Bishop and Jeff Jones) from \"Barney's Great Adventure\" (1998). In addition, the original version of \"Walkin' on Air\" (written and performed by Bishop) was featured in the 1986 film \"The Boy Who Could Fly\".\n\nIn 1989, Bishop released the album \"Bowling in Paris\" with Phil Collins (co-producer on some songs), Eric Clapton and Sting contributing. The album included a revamped version of \"Walkin' on Air\", this time featuring drumming, production, and additional vocals from Collins. This version became a #13 hit on the Adult Contemporary chart. In 1987, the Norwegian swing/pop duo Bobbysocks! had recorded their own version of \"Walking on Air\" (as \"Walkin' on Air\") as the title track to their album \"Walkin' on Air\".\n\nOn June 25, 2019, \"The New York Times Magazine\" listed Bishop among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.\n\nBishop has appeared in several motion pictures as a \"charming\" character, including four directed by John Landis. He had a cameo role, billed as \"Charming Guy\", in \"The Kentucky Fried Movie\" (1977), appearing as a hustler in the infamous \"Catholic High School Girls in Trouble\" segment. In addition to singing the theme song off-screen, Bishop had a cameo, billed as \"Charming Guy with Guitar\", in \"National Lampoon's Animal House\" (1978), as the aspiring folk singer whose guitar John Belushi smashes.\n\nBishop still keeps the smashed guitar as a memento. He appeared in \"The Blues Brothers\" (1980), billed as \"Charming Trooper\", who breaks his watch during the mall chase. He appeared, very briefly, in \"\" (1983), billed as \"Charming G.I.\", in the Vietnam War scene.

Then in 1952, Hermann Weyl published his fascinating book \"Symmetry\", which was later translated into 10 languages. Since then, it became an attractive subject of research in various fields. A variety of manifestations of the principle of symmetry in sculpture, painting, architecture, ornament, and design, in organic and inorganic nature has been revealed; the philosophical and mathematical significance of this principle has been studied.\nDuring the 1980's the discussions concerning the nature of the world, whether it was essentially probabilistic or naturally geometric, revived the interest of the researchers to the topic. The intellectual atmosphere of this period facilitated the idea of establishment of a new institution devoted to the study of all forms of complexity and patterns of symmetry and orderly structures pervading science, nature and society, that ultimately led to the establishment of the International Society for the Interdisciplinary Study of Symmetry.\n\nThe Society's community comprises several branches of science and art, while symmetry studies have gained the rank of an individual interdisciplinary field in the judgement of the scientific community. The Society has members in all continents, in over forty countries.\n\nThe Society was founded in 1989 following a successful international meeting in Budapest. \nIt has operated continuously since its foundation, publishing printed and web journals and hosting an International Congress and Exhibition entitled Symmetry: Art and Science every three years:\n\n\nInterim full conferences have been held in \n\nA new series of conferences under the general heading Logics of Image have been launched on 2013, planned to take place every two years.

It is located on the A37, east of Wells, between Shepton Mallet and Chilcompton. Its population in 2011 was 313. Binegar and Gurney Slade on the opposite side of the A37 are effectively a single village and share a sign on the main road. In Gurney Slade, the quarry and houses on the north side of Tape Lane are in Binegar parish whilst the south side is in Ashwick parish. In Binegar, some houses on the south side of Station Road are in Ashwick parish and some on the north side of the village are in Emborough parish.\n\nThe village had one Church of England Voluntary Controlled primary school, which was shut at the end of 2011, one very old church, post office, and smattering of houses. It also has 2 pubs, the \"Horse & Jockey\" and The George.\n\nIt used to have a station on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, which closed in 1966, and was the site of accidents on the line in 1885 and 1886.\n\nThe name of the village was \"Begenhangra\", in a charter of 1065, which probably meant \"the slope where beans are grown\". It formed part of the endowment of Wells Cathedral.\n\nCalamine ore was mined at Merchants Hill in the late 18th century, but the area's principal focus was on limestone quarrying, at Gurney Slade quarry, and agriculture. Adjacent to the quarry there is now a plant which processes powdered material (known as filler) from various Mendip quarries.\n\nThe parish was part of the hundred of Wells Forum.\n\nThe parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.\n\nThe village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Shepton Mallet Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.\n\nSomerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.\n\nIt is also part of the Wells county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.\n\nThe Norman Church of the Holy Trinity was rebuilt in the 15th century, and again rebuilt (except for the tower) in 1858 for Rev William Heade.

{"id": "2225073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2225073", "title": "Atopic dermatitis", "text": "Atopic dermatitis\n\nAtopic dermatitis (AD), also known as atopic eczema, is a long-term type of inflammation of the skin (dermatitis). It results in itchy, red, swollen, and cracked skin. Clear fluid may come from the affected areas, which often thickens over time. While the condition may occur at any age, it typically starts in childhood, with changing severity over the years. In children under one year of age, much of the body may be affected. As children get older, the areas on the insides of the knees and elbows are most commonly affected. In adults, the hands and feet are most commonly affected. Scratching the affected areas worsens the symptoms, and those affected have an increased risk of skin infections. Many people with atopic dermatitis develop hay fever or asthma.\nThe cause is unknown but believed to involve genetics, immune system dysfunction, environmental exposures, and difficulties with the permeability of the skin. If one identical twin is affected, there is an 85% chance the other also has the condition. Those who live in cities and dry climates are more commonly affected. Exposure to certain chemicals or frequent hand washing makes symptoms worse. While emotional stress may make the symptoms worse, it is not a cause. The disorder is not contagious. The diagnosis is typically based on the signs and symptoms. Other diseases that must be excluded before making a diagnosis include contact dermatitis, psoriasis, and seborrheic dermatitis.\nTreatment involves avoiding things that make the condition worse, daily bathing with application of a moisturising cream afterwards, applying steroid creams when flares occur, and medications to help with itchiness. Things that commonly make it worse include wool clothing, soaps, perfumes, chlorine, dust, and cigarette smoke. Phototherapy may be useful in some people. Steroid pills or creams based on calcineurin inhibitors may occasionally be used if other measures are not effective. Antibiotics (either by mouth or topically) may be needed if a bacterial infection develops. Dietary changes are only needed if food allergies are suspected.\nAtopic dermatitis affects about 20% of people at some point in their lives. It is more common in younger children. Males and females are equally affected. Many people outgrow the condition. Atopic dermatitis is sometimes called eczema, a term that also refers to a larger group of skin conditions. Other names include \"infantile eczema\", \"flexural eczema\", \"prurigo Besnier\", \"allergic eczema\", and \"neurodermatitis\".\n\nPeople with AD often have dry and scaly skin that spans the entire body, except perhaps the diaper area, and intensely itchy red, splotchy, raised lesions to form in the bends of the arms or legs, face, and neck.\n\nAD commonly affects the eyelids where signs such as Dennie-Morgan infraorbital fold, infra-auricular fissure, and periorbital pigmentation can be seen. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation on the neck gives the classic 'dirty neck' appearance. Lichenification, excoriation and erosion or crusting on the trunk may indicate secondary infection. Flexural distribution with ill-defined edges with or without hyperlinearity on the wrist, finger knuckles, ankle, feet and hand are also commonly seen.\n\nThe cause of AD is not known, although there is some evidence of genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors.\n\nMany people with AD have a family history of atopy. Atopy is an immediate-onset allergic reaction (type 1 hypersensitivity reaction) that manifests as asthma, food allergies, AD or hay fever.\n\nAbout 30% of people with atopic dermatitis have mutations in the gene for the production of filaggrin (\"FLG\"), which increase the risk for early onset of atopic dermatitis and developing asthma.\n\nAccording to the hygiene hypothesis, early childhood exposure to certain microorganisms (such as gut flora and helminth parasites) protects against allergic diseases by contributing to the development of the immune system. This exposure is limited in a modern \"sanitary\" environment, and the incorrectly-developed immune system is prone to develop allergies to harmless substances.\n\nThere is some support for this hypothesis with respect to AD. Those exposed to dogs while growing up have a lower risk of atopic dermatitis. There is also support from epidemiological studies for a protective role for helminths against AD. Likewise children with poor hygiene are at a lower risk for developing AD, as are children who drink unpasteurised milk.\n\nIn a small percentage of cases, atopic dermatitis is caused by sensitization to foods. Also, exposure to allergens, either from food or the environment, can exacerbate existing atopic dermatitis. Exposure to dust mites, for example, is believed to contribute to one's risk of developing AD. A diet high in fruits seems to have a protective effect against AD, whereas the opposite seems true for fast foods. Atopic dermatitis sometimes appears associated with celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and the improvement with a gluten-free diet indicates that gluten is a causative agent in these cases.\n\nColonization of the skin by the bacterium \"S. aureus\" is extremely prevalent in those with atopic dermatitis. Studies have found that abnormalities in the skin barrier of persons with AD are exploited by \"S. aureus\" to trigger cytokine expression, thus aggravating the condition.\n\nAtopic dermatitis in children may be linked to the level of calcium carbonate or \"hardness\" of household water, when used to drink. So far these findings have been supported in children from the United Kingdom, Spain, and Japan.\n\nThe pathophysiology may involve a mixture of type I and type IV-like hypersensitivity reactions.\n\nAtopic dermatitis is typically diagnosed clinically, meaning it is diagnosed based on signs and symptoms alone, without special testing. Several different forms of criteria developed for research have also been validated to aid in diagnosis. Of these, the UK Diagnostic Criteria, based on the work of Hanifin and Rajka, has been the most widely validated.\nThere is no known cure for AD, although treatments may reduce the severity and frequency of flares.\n\nApplying moisturisers may prevent the skin from drying out and decrease the need for other medications. Affected persons often report that improvement of skin hydration parallels with improvement in AD symptoms.\n\nHealth professionals often recommend that persons with AD bathe regularly in lukewarm baths, especially in salt water, to moisten their skin. Avoiding woollen clothing is usually good for those with AD. Likewise silk, silver-coated clothing may help. Dilute bleach baths have also been reported effective at managing AD.\n\nThe role of vitamin D on atopic dermatitis is not clear, but there is some evidence that vitamin D supplementation may improve its symptoms.\n\nStudies have investigated the role of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) supplementation and LCPUFA status in the prevention and treatment of atopic diseases, but the results are controversial. It remains unclear if the nutritional intake of n-3 fatty acids has a clear preventive or therapeutic role, or if n-6 fatty acids consumption promotes atopic diseases.\n\nSeveral probiotics seem to have a positive effect with a roughly 20% reduction in the rate of atopic dermatitis. The best evidence is for multiple strains of bacteria.\n\nIn people with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, a gluten free diet improves their symptoms and prevents the occurrence of new outbreaks.\n\nTopical corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone, have proven effective in managing AD. If topical corticosteroids and moisturisers fail, short-term treatment with topical calcineurin inhibitors like tacrolimus or pimecrolimus may be tried, although their use is controversial as some studies indicate that they increase the risk of developing skin cancer or lymphoma. A 2007 meta-analysis showed that topical pimecrolimus is not as effective than corticosteroids and tacrolimus. However a 2015 meta-analysis indicated that topical tacrolimus and picrolemus are more effective than low dose topical corticosteroids, and found no evidence for increased risk of malignancy or skin atrophy. \n\nOther medications used for AD include systemic immunosuppressants such as ciclosporin, methotrexate, interferon gamma-1b, mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine. Antidepressants and naltrexone may be used to control pruritus (itchiness). In 2016, crisaborole was approved as a topical treatment for mild-to-moderate eczema. In 2017, the biologic agent dupilumab was approved to treat moderate-to-severe eczema. Leukotriene inhibitors such as monteleukast are of unclear benefit as of 2018.\n\nThere is tentative evidence that allergy immunotherapy is effective in atopic dermatitis, but the quality of the evidence is low. This treatment consists of a series of injections or drops under the tongue of a solution containing the allergen.\n\nAntibiotics, either by mouth or applied topically, is commonly used to target overgrowth of \"Staphylococcus aureus\" in the skin of people with atopic dermatitis. However, a 2019 meta-analysis found no clear evidence of benefit.\n\nA more novel form of treatment involves exposure to broad or narrow-band ultraviolet (UV) light. UV radiation exposure has been found to have a localized immunomodulatory effect on affected tissues and may be used to decrease the severity and frequency of flares. In particular, the usage of UVA1 is more effective in treating acute flares, whereas narrow-band UVB is more effective in long-term management scenarios. However, UV radiation has also been implicated in various types of skin cancer, and thus UV treatment is not without risk.\n\nWhile there are several Chinese herbal medicines intended for treating atopic eczema, there is no conclusive evidence that these treatments, taken by mouth or applied topically, reduce the severity of eczema in children or adults.\n\nSince the beginning of the twentieth century, many inflammatory skin disorders have become more common; atopic dermatitis (AD) is a classic example of such a disease. It now affects 15–30% of children and 2–10% of adults in developed countries and in the United States has nearly tripled in the past thirty to forty years. Over 15 million American adults and children have atopic dermatitis.\n\nEvidence suggests that IL-4 is central in the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, there is a rationale for targeting IL-4 with anti-IL-4 inhibitors. People with atopic dermatitis are more likely to have \"Staphylococcus aureus\" living on them. The role this plays in pathogenesis is yet to be determined. Medications in Phase III trials as treatments include tralokinumab and abrocitinib.\n\n"}

{"id": "2225085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2225085", "title": "Naturphilosophie", "text": "Naturphilosophie\n\nNaturphilosophie (German for \"nature-philosophy\") is a term used in English-language philosophy to identify a current in the philosophical tradition of German idealism, as applied to the study of nature in the earlier 19th century. German speakers use the clearer term \"Romantische Naturphilosophie\", the philosophy of nature developed at the time of the founding of German Romanticism. It is particularly associated with the philosophical work of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel—though it has some clear precursors also. More particularly it is identified with some of the initial works of Schelling during the period 1797–9, in reaction to the views of Fichte, and subsequent developments from Schelling's position. Always controversial, some of Schelling's ideas in this direction are still considered of philosophical interest, even if the subsequent development of experimental natural science had a destructive impact on the credibility of the theories of his followers in \"Naturphilosophie\".\n\n\"Naturphilosophie\" attempted to comprehend nature in its totality and to outline its general theoretical structure, thus attempting to lay the foundations for the natural sciences. In developing their theories, the German \"Naturphilosophen\" found their inspiration in the natural philosophy of the Ancient Greek Ionian philosophers.\n\nAs an approach to philosophy and science, \"Naturphilosophie\" has had a difficult reception. In Germany, neo-Kantians came to distrust its developments as speculative and overly metaphysical. For most of the 19th and early 20th centuries, it was poorly understood in Anglophone countries. Over the years, it has been subjected to continuing criticism. Since the 1960s, improved translations have appeared, and scholars have developed a better appreciation of the objectives of \"Naturphilosophie\".\n\nThe German Idealist philosopher Fichte had attempted to show that the whole structure of reality follows necessarily from the fact of self-consciousness. Schelling took Fichte's position as his starting-point, and in his earliest writings posited that nature must have reality for itself. In this light Fichte's doctrines appeared incomplete. On the one hand, they identified the ultimate ground of the universe of reason too closely with finite, individual Spirit. On the other, they threatened the reality of the world of nature by seeing it too much in the manner of subjective idealism. Fichte, in this view, had not managed to unite his system with the aesthetic view of nature to which Immanuel Kant's \"Critique of Judgment\" had pointed.\n\n\"Naturphilosophie\" is therefore one possible theory of the unity of nature. Nature as the sum of what is objective, and intelligence as the complex of all the activities making up self-consciousness, appear as equally real. The philosophy of nature and transcendental idealism would be the two complementary portions making up philosophy as a whole.\n\n\"Naturphilosophie\" translated into English would mean just \"philosophy of nature\", and its scope began to be taken in a broad way. Johann Gottfried Herder, particularly taken in opposition to Immanuel Kant, was a precursor of Schelling:\n\nHerder's dynamic view of nature was developed by Goethe and Schelling and led to the tradition of \"Naturphilosophie\"[...]\n\nLater Friedrich Schlegel theorised about a particular German strand in philosophy of nature, citing Jakob Böhme, Johannes Kepler and Georg Ernst Stahl, with Jan Baptist van Helmont as an edge case. Frederick Beiser instead traces \"Naturphilosophie\" as developed by Schelling, Hegel, Schlegel and Novalis to a crux in the theory of matter, and identifies the origins of the line they took with the \"vis viva\" theory of matter in the work of Gottfried Leibniz.\n\nSubsequently Schelling identified himself with Baruch de Spinoza, to whose thought he saw himself as approaching. The \"Darstellung meines Systems\", and the expanded treatment in the lectures on a \"System der gesamten Philosophie und der Naturphilosophie insbesondere\" given in Würzburg in 1804, contain elements of Spinoza's philosophy.\n\nIn a short space of time Schelling produced three works: \"Ideen zu einer Philosophie der Natur als Einleitung in das Studium dieser Wissenschaft\", 1797 (\"Ideas for a Philosophy of Nature as Introduction to the Study of this Science\"); \"Von der Weltseele\", 1798 (\"On the World Soul\"); and \"Erster Entwurf eines Systems der Naturphilosophie\", 1799 (First Plan of a System of the Philosophy of Nature). As criticism of scientific procedure, these writings retain a relevance. Historically, according to Richards:\n\nDespite the tentativeness of their titles, these monographs introduced radical interpretations of nature that would reverberate through the sciences, and particularly the biology, of the next century. They developed the fundamental doctrines of \"Naturphilosophie\".\n\nIn \"System des transzendentalen Idealismus\", 1800 (\"System of Transcendental Idealism\") Schelling included ideas on matter and the organic in Part III. They form just part of a more ambitious work that takes up other themes, in particular aesthetics. From this point onwards \"Naturphilosophie\" was less of a research concern for him, as he reformulated his philosophy. However, it remained an influential aspect of his teaching. For a short while, he edited a journal, the \"Neue Zeitschrift für speculative Physik\" (bound volume 1802).\n\nSchelling's \"Naturphilosophie\" was a way in which he worked himself out of the tutelage of Fichte, with whom he quarrelled decisively towards the end of the 1790s. More than that, however, it brought him within the orbit of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, both intellectually and (as a direct consequence of Goethe's sympathetic attitude) by a relocation; and it broke with basic Kantian tenets. Grant writes:\n\nSchelling's postkantian confrontation with nature itself begins with the overthrow of the Copernican revolution ...\n\nSchelling held that the divisions imposed on nature, by our ordinary perception and thought, do not have absolute validity. They should be interpreted as the outcome of the single formative energy which is the soul or inner aspect of nature. In other words he was a proponent of a variety of organicism. The dynamic series of stages in nature, the forms in which the ideal structure of nature is realized, are matter, as the equilibrium of the fundamental expansive and contractive forces; light, with its subordinate processes (magnetism, electricity, and chemical action); organism, with its component phases of reproduction, irritability and sensibility. The continual change presented to us by experience, taken together with the thought of unity in productive force of nature, leads to the conception of the duality through which nature expresses itself in its varied products.\n\nIn the introduction to the \"Ideen\" he argues against dogmatism, in the terms that a dogmatist cannot explain the organic; and that recourse to the idea of a cosmic creator is a feature of dogmatic systems imposed by the need to explain nature as purposive and unified. Fichte's system, called the \"Wissenschaftslehre\", had begun with a fundamental distinction between dogmatism (fatalistic) and criticism (free), as his formulation of idealism.\n\nBeiser divides up the mature form of Schelling's \"Naturphilosophie\" into the attitudes of transcendental realism (the thesis that \"nature exists independent of all consciousness, even that of the transcendental subject\") and transcendental naturalism (the thesis that \"everything is explicable according to the laws of nature, including the rationality of the transcendental subject\"). He notes how \"Naturphilosophie\" was first a counterbalance to \"Wissenschaftslehre\", and then in Schelling's approach became the senior partner. After that, it was hardly to be avoided that Schelling would become an opponent of Fichte, having been a close follower in the early 1790s.\n\nWe are able to apprehend and represent nature to ourselves in the successive forms which its development assumes, since it is the same spirit of which we become aware in self-consciousness, though here unconsciously. The variety of its forms is not imposed on it externally, since there is no external teleology in nature. Nature is a self-forming whole, within which only natural explanations can be sought. The function of \"Naturphilosophie\" is to exhibit the ideal as springing from the real, not to deduce the real from the ideal.\n\nCriticism of \"Naturphilosophie\" has been widespread, over two centuries. Schelling's theories, however influential in terms of the general culture of the time, have not survived in scientific terms. Like other strands of speculation in the life sciences, in particular, such as vitalism, they retreated in the face of experiment, and then were written out of the history of science as Whig history. But critics were initially not scientists (a term not used until later); rather they came largely from within philosophy and Romantic science, a community including many physicians. Typically, the retrospective views of scientists of the 19th century on \"Romantic science\" in general erased distinctions:\n\nScientific criticism in the nineteenth century took hardly any notice of the distinctions between Romantic, speculative and transcendental, scientific and aesthetic directions.\n\nOne outspoken critic was the chemist Justus von Liebig, who compared \"Naturphilosophie\" with the Black Death. Another critic, the physiologist Emil du Bois-Reymond, frequently dismissed \"Naturphilosophie\" as \"bogus\".\n\nIsaiah Berlin summed up the reasons why \"Naturphilosophie\" had a wide-ranging impact on views of art and artists:\n\nif everything in nature is living, and if we ourselves are simply its most self-conscious representatives, the function of the artist is to delve within himself, and above all to delve within the dark and unconscious forces which move within him, and to bring these to consciousness by the most agonising and violent internal struggle.\n\nFichte was very critical of the opposition set up in Schelling's \"Naturphilosophie\" to his own conception of \"Wissenschaftslehre\". In that debate, Hegel then intervened, largely supporting his student friend Schelling, with the work usually called his \"Differenzschrift\", the \"Differenz des Fichteschen und Schellingschen Systems der Philosophie\" (The Difference Between Fichte's and Schelling's System of Philosophy); a key publication in his own philosophical development, his first book, it was published in September 1801.\n\nSchelling's Absolute was left with no other function than that of removing all the differences which give form to thought. The criticisms of Fichte, and more particularly of Hegel (in the Preface to the \"Phenomenology of Spirit\"), pointed to a defect in the conception of the Absolute as mere featureless identity. It was ridiculed by Hegel as \"the night in which all cows are black.\"\n\nIgnaz Paul Vitalis Troxler, a follower of Schelling, later broke with him. He came to the view that the Absolute in nature and mind is beyond the intellect and reason.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2225092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2225092", "title": "Gigi Gryce", "text": "Gigi Gryce\n\nGigi Gryce (born George General Grice Jr.; November 28, 1925 – March 14, 1983), later Basheer Qusim, was an American jazz saxophonist, flautist, clarinetist, composer, arranger, and educator.\n\nWhile his performing career was relatively short, much of his work as a player, composer, and arranger was quite influential and well-recognized during his time. However, Gryce abruptly ended his jazz career in the 1960s. This, in addition to his nature as a very private person, has resulted in very little knowledge of Gryce today. Several of his compositions have been covered extensively (\"Minority\", \"Social Call\", \"Nica's Tempo\") and have become minor jazz standards. Gryce's compositional bent includes harmonic choices similar to those of contemporaries Benny Golson, Tadd Dameron and Horace Silver. Gryce's playing, arranging, and composing are most associated with the classic hard bop era (roughly 1953–1965). He was a well-educated composer and musician, and wrote some classical works as a student at the Boston Conservatory. As a jazz musician and composer he was very much influenced by the work of Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk.\n\nGeorge General Gryce Jr. was born in Pensacola, Florida on November 28, 1925.\n\nHis family's strong emphasis on music, manners, and discipline had a tremendous effect on him as a child and into his later career. Grice's parents were of modest means, his mother a seamstress and his father the owner of a small cleaning and pressing service. The family belonged to the African Methodist Episcopal Church and attended services diligently. Especially as the Great Depression began to take its toll on the family's financial welfare, the Grices did their best to instill the value of discipline and hard work in their children.\n\nMusic was very much emphasized in the Grice household. The family had a piano in the house, which Gigi and his siblings (four older sisters and one younger brother) were encouraged to play. Mostly church music was performed in the Grice home, while pop and jazz was mostly frowned upon. (Later, however, when Gigi pursued jazz as a career, his mother and older sisters would support him personally and financially.) Many of the Grice children were encouraged to pursue vocal performance at church, school, and other community; for a time the family even held weekly recitals in their home.\n\nThe early thirties saw tragedy and hardship for the Grice family. In 1931, as the economic crisis of The Great Depression began to take hold, the Grices were forced to sell their cleaning business. Two years later, Gigi's father, George Sr., died after suffering a heart attack. Rebecca Grice was forced to raise the children as a single mother, relocating the family in order to rent out the house. Even through this hardship, however, Rebecca continued to motivate her children for success through strict but supportive parenting, encouraging musical development, hard work, discipline, and Christian morals.\n\nGigi very much applied his family's sense of discipline to his developing passion for music. As a youth Gigi was described as bright but reserved, extremely polite, studious, and formal in nature. It is unclear exactly when Gigi first began learning the clarinet – it is rumored he may have started as early as age 9 or 10, but the first evidence for his pursuit appears later as he entered high school. The under-resourced, and at this time, mostly black Booker T. Washington High School had a series of music teachers through the Federal Music Project; Gigi first studied with Joseph Jessie and later Raymond Shepard. As it was for many, a musical instrument would have been a crippling expense for the Grices during the Depression; when Gigi and his brother Tommy studied clarinet with Shepard they allegedly borrowed the same clarinet from a friend directly before each lesson. Eventually, Gigi's mother was able to buy him his own metal cavalry clarinet, with which Gigi became quite successful as a high school student, winning school and state competitions. At school Gigi was also able to study music theory, which he very much enjoyed and continued to explore on the piano at home \n\nGryce graduated from high school in 1943, working at the shipyard and playing in Raymond Shepard's professional band for a time before being drafted by the navy in March 1944. Gryce continued to pursue music during his two-year term, making his way into the navy band and earning the rank of musician second class. While stationed in Great Lakes, Illinois, Gryce spent time in Chicago during leaves and became more acquainted with the sound of bebop. It was at this time that he bought his own alto saxophone and, in Chicago, that he met musicians Andrew \"Goon\" Gardner and Harry Curtis. Gryce may have even briefly studied at the Chicago Conservatory of Music.\n\nAfter completing his time in the navy, Gryce decided to continue his musical education, financially supported by the G.I. Bill as well as his mother and older sisters. He moved to Hartford to live with his sister Harriet and her husband in 1946, and the following year enrolled at the Boston Conservatory. At the Boston Conservatory Gryce developed his theoretical background and studied classical composition, writing three symphonies and a ballet in addition to other works. He was very much inspired and influenced by the work and philosophy of Boston Conservatory composer Alan Hovhaness, a musical eclectic whose passion was for melodicism and lyricism.\n\nDuring his time at the conservatory Gryce also developed connections in the Hartford, Boston, and New York jazz scenes which would have a tremendous effect on his later career as a jazz musician, composer, and arranger. While New York was best known for cutting edge jazz of the time, both Boston and Hartford were also the sites of active and innovative jazz scenes. Gryce traveled between the two cities, and arranged for local bands including those of Sabby Lewis, Phil Edmonds, and Bunky Emerson. While Gryce developed his theoretical background and a passion for the works of Bartok and Stravinsky, he simultaneously developed an obsession for the work of Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk, with whom, around 1949, he became acquainted and also performed. Gryce developed a reputation as a well-trained and talented artist, and became relatively well known in the local Boston and Hartford scenes. He also began to explore the New York scene, where he would eventually find himself in the early fifties.\n\nGryce is rumored to have traveled to Paris on a Fulbright scholarship in 1951 to study with Nadia Boulanger and Arthur Honegger. However, there is much confusion and rumor surrounding this period in Gryce's life, and there is no evidence to suggest that Gryce did receive a Fulbright or formally study with the two composers. Gryce did take two semesters off to study in Europe, but little is known about his travels. It is possible that he studied with the composers privately. While Gryce did propagate the Fulbright rumor himself to substantiate his credentials, Gryce had little else to say about this time in his life.\n\nAfter graduating with a degree in composition in 1952, Gryce relocated to New York City, where he would enjoy much success in the mid fifties. In 1953 Max Roach recorded one of Gryce's charts with his septet, and soon after Gryce recorded with Howard McGhee and wrote for Horace Silver's sextet as well.\n\nGryce was influenced by Tadd Dameron, with whom he played in 1953 at the Paradise Club. Gryce had not yet reached his peak as a musician or soloist, but was developing a reputation as a versatile and talented composer and arranger. Later in 1953 Gryce also contributed a tune, \"Up in Quincy's Place\" to Art Farmer's Prestige recordings. While this recording was rather inconsequential, Farmer would become one of Gryce's closest colleagues.\n\nOne of the most important connections Gryce made in New York was with Quincy Jones, who encouraged Lionel Hampton to hire Gryce for his band in the summer of 1953. After playing with Hampton's band in the States, Gryce was invited to join the band for their European tour.\n\nWhile the style of the Hampton band was outdated and overly commercialized in Gryce's eyes, the opportunities and connections made on the European tour were largely what propelled Gryce into success as an artist. In Hampton's band, Gryce played with Anthony Ortega, Clifford Solomon (tenor saxophone), Clifford Scott, Oscar Estelle (baritone saxophone), Walter Williams (trumpet), Art Farmer, Clifford Brown, Quincy Jones, Al Hayse, Jimmy Cleveland, George \"Buster\" Cooper, William \"Monk\" Montgomery, and Alan Dawson. Gryce became particularly close friends with Clifford Brown, with whom he found much in common. The Hampton tour did not pay well, and Gryce and others frequently sought recording opportunities on the side, particularly in Stockholm and Paris, where Europeans were eager to record touring Americans. There was already some tension in the band between young bebop-influenced musicians and the more established swing musicians (including Hampton himself), and Hampton did not react well when he heard his musicians were recording on the side.\n\nThe recordings Gryce made with Clifford Brown and others on the tour were often hurried and done on the fly, yet they were instrumental in building his career, particularly as a composer. Notable of these European recordings were \"Paris the Beautiful\", featuring tonal centers a third apart and a Parker-influenced solo by Gryce; \"Brown Skins\", a concerto for a large jazz ensemble; \"Blue Concept\", recorded by the Gryce-Brown sextet; and \"Strictly Romantic\", which oscillates between A flat and G major. In addition, Henri Renaud recorded an entire album exclusively of Gryce's work, which did a great deal to build his reputation.\n\nGryce and the other personnel from the Hampton Band returned to New York in November 1953, where the hard bop scene was just beginning to gain traction. This was the perfect time for Gryce to arrive on the scene. Soon after his return, he recorded with Henri Renaud, and Art Blakey recorded seven of Gryce's songs for EmArcy records. Gryce formed a quintet with Farmer in March 1954, which first recorded for Prestige Records in May of that year. Personnel included pianist Horace Silver, bassist Percy Heath, and Drummer Kenny Clarke. Gryce's works with Farmer are some of his most influential and best known. In June of that year Gryce again recorded with Farmer, this time exclusively as composer and arranger. By the time Farmer and Gryce began their third project, they had hit their creative stride.\n\nThe record made in May 1955 by the Farmer-Gryce quintet featured pianist Freddie Redd, bassist Addison Farmer, and drummer Art Taylor. This session exemplifies Gryce's feel for thematic development, all of the pieces artfully composed and arranged. Later in 1955 Gryce also played for Oscar Pettiford's octet, and got the opportunity to play alto in Thelonious Monk's recording with Percy Heath and Art Blakey for Signal Records.\n\nThe final ticket to Gryce's success was his third recording with the Farmer Quintet in October 1955 and his nonet recordings for Signal Records immediately after. The Farmer record featured non-standard forms, and adventurous arrangements which pushed the limits of the hard bop idiom. His Signal Records arrangements were very much influenced by the style and instrumentation of Miles Davis's Birth of the Cool group, and were very well received by the jazz community. By the mid-1950s Gryce was a major figure in jazz, known as a great individualist, a competent studio musician, and an innovative composer.\n\nIn addition to his musical career, Gryce was a vehement advocate of composers' and musicians' rights. In 1955 he started his own publishing company, Melotone Music, and later an additional company called Totem. This was a time when black musicians in particularly were taken advantage of by the music industry. Many musicians neglected the business side of their careers or were actively cheated by record companies. As a composer Gryce always ensured that he got credit for his work, and actively encouraged his colleagues to do the same. Silver largely credits Gryce with inspiring him to found his Ecaroh Music company and the Silveto label. Little is known about Gryce's financial troubles in the early 1960s, but this hardship very much contributed to Gryce's breakdown and withdrawal from the jazz community.\n\nGryce stayed on the cutting edge through 1956 until his career peaked in 1957. He worked on several projects as composer and arranger with the Teddy Charles Tentet and the Oscar Pettiford Orchestra. The Tentet began as an outgrowth of Charles Mingus's Jazz Composers Workshop, and was very successful as a performing dance band despite its experimental nature. His work with the Oscar Pettiford Orchestra was also extremely well-recognized, producing significant coverage to the musicians who participated as well as to Gryce himself.\n\nIn 1957 Gryce and Donald Byrd collaborated on a series of projects with Jazz Lab, which produced play-along recordings as educational tools. Gryce's arrangements were fresh but accessible, tailored for educational purposes. The rhythm section played with a soloist to give the play-alongs a more natural feel. The group also performed, and gave a rather lukewarm performance at the Newport Jazz Festival.\n\nThe years 1957 to 1960 saw a series of miscellaneous projects for Gryce. He continued to play with the Jazz Lab, as well as writing for Betty Carter, Art Farmer, Jimmy Cleveland, Curtis Fuller, and Max Roach. He put together his own quintet, which he renamed the Orch-tette after adding vibraphonist Eddie Costa in 1960. His recordings with the Orch-tette had potential, but featured intricate arrangements which limited space for solos. Gryce worked on a handful of other projects in 1960, including a film score to \"On the Sound\" by Phil Baker and a final studio recording on Randy Weston's Uhuru Afrika. However, by this time Gryce was becoming preoccupied with business troubles associated with his publishing companies, as well as some family issues. Gryce's genre of hard bop was beginning to give way to more experimental strains. Around 1963, Gryce withdrew completely from his jazz career.\n\nFrom childhood Gryce was always marked by a private and formal disposition. While he was very well liked by his colleagues, he was often very much an outsider in the community. Gryce also followed a strict moral lifestyle, abstaining from alcohol, drugs, and other vices common among his colleagues.\n\nGryce is known to have had two romantic relationships before his marriage to Eleanor Sears in 1953. Gryce had a brief relationship with Evelyn \"Baby\" Dubose in Pensacola during his Pensacola and Navy years, for whom he named his piece \"Baby\" which was recorded in Europe in 1953. He also had a casual relationship with vocalist Margie Anderson, with whom he worked during his time in Boston. On December 20, 1953, soon after his return from the Lionel Hampton tour, he married Eleanor Sears, to whom he was introduced by trumpeter Idrees Sulieman. Several of his compositions are credited to pseudonym \"Lee Sears.\"\n\nThey had three children: Bashir (born 1957); Laila (born 1959); and Lynette (born 1963). They also had a child, Bilil, in 1958 who was born prematurely and did not survive infancy.\n\nGryce had always been described as having a strict moral sensibility. He may have been interested in Islam as early as 1950, and as a student became interested in religious history. At the Boston Conservatory in 1953 he named one of his symphonies \"Gashiya\" for a surah in the Qur'an. Gryce reveals little about who or what urged his conversion, but Islam was an increasingly popular faith among black jazz musicians in the fifties, particularly Ahmadiyya, Nation of Islam, and Sunni Islam. Gryce is believed to have converted during or shortly after his travels in Europe during his college years. While Gryce did not regularly attend the mosque, he did read the Qur'an and abstain from drugs, alcohol, and pork. His faith was a source of some tension in his marriage to Eleanor, who remained a practicing Christian. Many of Gryce's compositions had Islamic titles and his first two children Islam-inspired names.\n\nLittle is known about the real nature of Gryce's retreat from jazz, as this period is characterized by a great deal of misunderstanding and rumor. Gryce revealed very little about his business hardships, but what is known is that his publishing business encountered financial troubles in the early 1960s, with many musicians withdrawing from Melotone and Totem. Many of his colleagues believe that powerful interests considered Gryce's publishing activities a threat, and were forcing him out of business. Rumors circulated about intimidation and threats to his family. While these rumors have not been confirmed, Gryce's behavior became extremely introverted and erratic during this time. He dissolved his publishing companies in 1963 and gave up his music career, thereafter adopting his Islamic name entirely, Basheer Qusim.\n\nIn the 1960s Gryce reinvented himself as a public school teacher in New York. He was somewhat interested in education throughout his life, and was said to be an excellent music instructor. He received a master's degree in education from Fordham University in 1978 and developed an incredible passion for teaching. He left a lasting legacy at Elementary School No. 53 in the Bronx, which was renamed in his honor after his death. Students, colleagues, and parents who encountered Gryce during this time knew him as a very private, serious, passionate, and caring man. Believing that music aided literacy, Gryce was a strict but caring teacher, and went out of his way to aid students at educational risk, working at an under-resourced mostly black and Hispanic school.\n\nGryce died on March 14, 1983, of a heart attack after becoming increasingly ill. Before his death he reached out to his family again, and visited Pensacola for the first time in almost thirty years.\n\nWhile in many ways his work exemplifies the conventions of the hard bop era, Gryce always attempted to push the limits of common practice. As an educated composer with an extensive theoretical background, Gryce was prone to unconventional harmonization, form, and instrumentation as his style developed. In \"Up in Quincy's Place\", one of his very early tunes, Gryce was rather ahead of his time in his frequent use of quartal harmony, a practice that would be popularized during the cool jazz era.\n\nHis compositions and arrangements with Farmer continued to feature non-standard forms and harmonies 175. His approach to hard bop trod the line between experimental and accessible, particularly in later work with the Teddy Charles Tentet and the Oscar Pettiford Orchestra. As an experimental composer, his goal was not jazz without limits, but forms which provided boundaries which liberated the soloist.\n\nWhile Gryce was a very accomplished saxophonist, clarinetist, and flautist his playing tended to be less innovative than his writing. As a saxophonist he was always very much influenced by Charlie Parker, who he had always idolized and became friends with in the mid-fifties. Contemporaries recall that Parker would sometimes borrow Gryce's horn.\n\n\nWith Art Blakey\nWith Clifford Brown\nWith Betty Carter\nWith Teddy Charles\nWith Jimmy Cleveland\nWith Earl Coleman\nWith Kenny Dorham\nWith Art Farmer\nWith Curtis Fuller\nWith Dizzy Gillespie\nWith Benny Golson\nWith Thad Jones\nWith Duke Jordan\nWith Herbie Mann\nWith Mat Mathews\nWith Big Maybelle\nWith Howard McGhee\nWith Thelonious Monk\nWith Lee Morgan\nWith Oscar Pettiford\nWith Johnnie Ray\nWith Max Roach\nWith Tony Scott\nWith Mal Waldron\nWith Randy Weston\nWith Leo Wright\n\n"}

She would also take the position eventually, but after receiving a fragment of the cursed sword, Soul Edge, and sensing its malicious impact on humanity, she decides to travel the world so she could return it to its rightful place and restore balance to the world. \n\nThe character has received positive reception, often noting her unique speed-driven fighting style as well as her sexual appeal, despite her relatively young age. Her absence in \"Soulcalibur V\" has induced criticism from various outlets.\n\nTalim is regarded as the first Filipina character introduced to the fighting game genre. In the character's native Tagalog language, her name means \"edge\" or \"sharp\". Her design and concept were built to revolve around them, starting with gender, then physical measurements, and lastly background details. Once established her appearance and movement were fleshed out by the team's concept artist Aya Takemura and rendered as a 3D model by a design team that worked solely on the character. Talim was then animated by a motion designer using motion capture and working directly with the team. During this phase the team additionally worked with the \"Soulcalibur\" story creators, refining the character's own role in the plot as needed throughout development.\n\nAs a character introduced in \"Soulcalibur II\", Talim's weapons, a pair of elbow blades, were decided upon before other aspects of the character were. Originally considered for the first \"Soulcalibur\", the weapons were selected to be unique amongst the others characters' weapons in the title. Talim's weapons were built around the concept of dual-weapon usage, with special emphasis that while bladed, the weapons themselves were not actual tonfa. During development it was considered to allow them to transform and be sentient, however the idea was abandoned. Talim's character concept was designed around the idea of introducing a young female character that the developers felt the series lacked, while at the same time making her appear androgynous.\n\nIn the Village of the Wind Deity (\"Nayong Anito ng Hangin\"), Samar island, there lived a tribe of people who could control the winds. Talim was the granddaughter of this village's elder, Kalana, and daughter of its shaman, Lidi. Due to turmoil caused by the influences of Spanish and Portuguese culture, she was reared to be its last priestess (babaylan). The day that the Evil Seed spread across the world, Talim felt the winds, and an evil aura that devoured everything in its path surged into her body, causing her to lose consciousness for days. \n\nYears later, when Talim was 15 years old, a man from the west brought with him a strange metal fragment, claiming it to be a vitality amulet. Talim, however, recognized the evil energy as the same energy she had experienced years before and left on a journey, believing that if she were to return the fragment to its rightful place, peace would eventually be restored, despite the elders' misgivings. Having collected several of the fragments, she eventually learned that the source of the evil energy was an evil sword called Soul Edge. Sensing another source of evil energy, Talim traveled to a mountain range, eventually locating it in a sick child living at a watermill. A young man named Hong Yun-seong arrived later as Talim settled into the watermill to try to heal the child, also searching for clues regarding Soul Edge, and came to stay with her. Talim ultimately healed the child by releasing the evil energy from within him all at once into the wind. She then left the watermill with Yun-seong and continued to search for Soul Edge in \"Soulcalibur IV\". They met Seong Mi-na on their travels, and together she and Talim tried to convince Yun-seong of the dangers in attempting to attain Soul Edge's power. However, Yun-seong vanished the next day, leaving both of them worried but hoping he would make the right choice. The two parted ways: Mi-na to look for Yun-seong, while Talim carried on the search for Soul Edge alone.\n\nTalim wields Syi Salika and Loka Luha, a pair of tonfa-like weapons called Elbow Blades, used by the wind-worshipping people of Southeast Asia in ceremonial dances and thus are more ritual items rather than weapons. Her movement and fighting style were designed around her culture and a bird-theme, emphasizing close horizontal strikes upon opponents as well as freedom of movement. In \"Soulcalibur III\", these weapons, and Talim's \"Wind Dance\" fighting style are available under the discipline \"Soul of Talim\" to characters created under the \"Saint\" class. The names of her moves are mostly in Tagalog. According to 1UP.com, Talim is a difficult character to master as the player using her \"has to rely on tricks, gimmicks, and stuns to really apply any damage, and these need a bit of time -- and timing -- to set up.\"\n\nTalim's initial addition to the series has been received warmly, with reviews of \"Soulcalibur II\" describing her as a welcome addition to the series as well as a \"speed demon\". \"GameNOW\" described her as \"profoundly unique not only to \"SC2\", but to fighting games in general.\" GameSpy's Christian Nutt stated Talim's \"unpredictable nature\" made her interesting, though added \"she's almost too cute to fit in with the rest of the \"SCII\" crew.\" Insert Credit's Tim Rogers called Talim \"the cutest of the young girl characters [in \"Soulcalibur II\"] by \"far\",\" and a preference for her symmetrical outfits. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" noted a positive impression in her ability to fight against the title's much larger male characters, an effect University of Delaware professor Rachel Hutchinson described as \"entertainment through deviation from the norm\" against stereotypical gender expectations. In 2013, \"Complex\" ranking her the eighth best character in the series. In 2015, Talim was voted the most popular \"Soulcalibur\" character in the West in an official poll by Namco Bandai.\n\nDespite her age, Talim has been utilized in material revolving around her sex appeal as a female character, such as \"\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s swimsuit issues and \"Play\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Girls of Gaming\" publications, and \"The Village Voice\" noted concern over the character's portrayal in such material, describing it as \"troubling\". An absence of Talim in \"Soulcalibur V\" was criticized in the reviews by some outlets such as Kotaku and Game Revolution. However, Brittany Vincent of Cheat Code Central featured her on the 2011 list of top ten most overrated video game characters, stating that \"she grates on the nerves with her angelic personality and 'never give up' spirit. Now, Taki on the other hand...\" In 2012, Kristie Bertucci of Gadget Review ranked her as the 14th \"hottest\" female video game character for her \"curves in all the right places\" and \"a very sexy and skimpy outfit.\"\n\n"}

It is largely coterminous with the present-day region of Czech Silesia and was, historically, part of the larger Silesia region.\n\nAustrian Silesia consisted of two territories, separated by the Moravian land strip of Moravská Ostrava between the Ostravice and Oder rivers.\n\nThe area east of the Ostravice around Cieszyn reached from the heights of the Western Carpathians (Silesian Beskids) in the south, where it bordered with the Kingdom of Hungary, along the Olza and upper Vistula rivers to the border with Prussian Silesia in the north. In the east the Biała river at Bielsko separated it from the Lesser Polish lands of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, incorporated into the Austrian Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria upon the First Partition of Poland in 1772.\n\nThe territory west of the Oder river stretching from the town of Opava up to Bílá Voda was confined by the Jeseníky mountain range of the eastern Sudetes in the south, separating it from Moravia, and the Opava river in the north. In the west the Golden Mountains formed the border with the County of Kladsko.\n\nThe area originally formed the south-eastern part of the Medieval Duchy of Silesia, a province of the Piast Kingdom of Poland. During the 14th century most Dukes of Silesia had declared themselves Bohemian vassals.\n\nAs part of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown, Silesia was inherited by the Habsburg archduke Ferdinand I of Austria in 1526, after the last Jagiellon king Louis II of Bohemia had died at the Battle of Mohács. With the female succession of the Habsburg empress Maria Theresa to the throne in 1740, the Prussian king Frederick the Great laid claim to the Silesian province and, without waiting for any reply, on 16 December started the First Silesian War, thereby opening the larger War of the Austrian Succession. His campaign was concluded in 1742 with the Prussian victory at the Battle of Chotusitz leading to the treaties of Breslau and Berlin, in which Silesia was divided. \n\nUnder the terms of the treaty, the Kingdom of Prussia received most of the territory including the Bohemian County of Kladsko, while only a small part of southeastern Silesia remained with the Habsburg Monarchy, consisting of:\nforming the Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia, which remained a Bohemian crown land with its capital in the city of Opava. In 1766 the title of a Duke of Teschen was granted to Prince Albert of Saxony, son-in-law of Maria Theresa, while the title of a Duke of Troppau and Jägerndorf remained with the Princely Family of Liechtenstein. The Nysa territory was held by the Bishops of Wrocław with their residence at Castle Jánský vrch \"(Johannisberg)\".\n\nWhen in 1804 the Habsurg emperor Francis II established the Austrian Empire, his title would include the \"Duke of Upper and Lower Silesia\". Austrian Silesia was connected by rail with the Austrian capital Vienna, when the Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway line was extended to Bohumín station in 1847. In the course of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 the Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia became a crown land of Cisleithanian Austria.\n\nIn 1918, the Austrian monarchy was abolished and the major part of Austrian Silesia was ceded to the newly created state of Czechoslovakia by the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, with the exception of Cieszyn Silesia (the former Duchy of Teschen), which after the Polish–Czechoslovak War was split in 1920 along the Olza river with its eastern part falling to the Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship of Poland. Smaller parts of the duchy also became a part of Poland, while the adjacent Hlučín Region of Prussian Silesia fell to Czechoslovakia.\nAccording to an Austrian census, Austrian Silesia in 1910 was home to 756,949 people, speaking the following languages:\n\nTowns with more than 5,000 people in 1880:\n\nThe Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia was originally divided into the two districts \"(Bezirke)\" of Teschen (\"Těšínský kraj\", pop. 213,040 in 1847) and Troppau (\"Opavský kraj\", pop. 260,199) with its seat at Krnov. In eastern Teschen, the autonomous Duchy of Bielsko was established in 1754. Upon the Revolutions of 1848 and up to its dissolution Austrian Silesia was intermittently re-organised into the districts of:\n\n\nFor example, in 1900, there were 8 \"Bezirkshauptmannschaften\" in Austrian Silesia (in comparison to above list without Frydek).\n"}

Two versions were released, one containing a single CD, with the second version being a double album on LP and CD known as \"AC/DC Live: 2 CD Collector's Edition\". A feature-length live video, \"AC/DC: Live at Donington\", was released concurrently. The double album \"AC/DC Live: 2 CD Collector's Edition\" was released a month after the single-disc version, in a slipcased two-disc \"book\" (similar in shape to old CD longboxes) and containing an AC/DC dollar note known as \"Angus Bucks\". Both editions of the album were re-released in 2003 as part of the \"AC/DC Remasters\" series. \n\n\"Disclaimer: guitar and vocal overdubs were added during post-production, so the original audio (found on bootlegs) will be slightly different from the album version. The recordings from the dates listed below were used as a basis before being edited.\"\n\"These dates are not listed in the album booklet and were confirmed by fans synchronizing bootlegs with the album.\"\n\nThe Japanese version includes the bonus track \"Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be\" (Donington Park, Leicestershire, England; 17 August 1991) which was the b-side of the \"Highway To Hell\" (live) single.

This ranks among the best live metal albums of the '90s.\" Classic Rock wrote that \"Live is a triumphant refutation to anyone who still claims ‘DC died with Bon.

The ships are called \"packet boats\" as their original function was to carry mail.\n\nA \"packet ship\" was originally a vessel employed to carry post office mail packets to and from British embassies, colonies and outposts. In sea transport, a packet service is a regular, scheduled service, carrying freight and passengers. The ships used for this service are called packet ships or packet boats. The seamen are called packetmen, and the business is called packet trade. \n\n\"Packet\" can mean a small parcel but, originally meant a parcel of important correspondence or valuable items, for urgent delivery. The French-language term \"paquebot\" derives from the English term \"packet boat,\" but means a large ocean liner.\nThis sense became extended to mean any regularly scheduled ship, carrying passengers, as in packet trade. The word \"packet\" is frequently modified by the destination, e.g. Sydney packet, or by motive force, e.g. \"steam packet\".\n\nMany states, civilisations and organisations set up mail systems for high value goods, especially confidential correspondence and bullion. In times of war, regular shipments ran the gauntlet of warships and privateers, and even in peacetime, pirates could be a threat on some routes. In 1829, the pirate Mansel Alcantra captured the packet \"Topaz\" and murdered her crew after looting her.\n\nIn Britain, the Post Office Packet Service used small, fast, lightly armed ships to carry state papers to overseas destinations on a regular schedule. This service operated from Tudor times until 1823, when the Admiralty assumed the responsibility for running the service. During the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars the packet ships were targets for privateers and warships seeking prize money. Although some were captured, others managed to fight back. In the 1850s the Post Office moved to using contract carriers.\n\nOther European states with overseas colonies also developed packet mail systems. Eventually, however, commercial steam liners began to work regular international schedules and received contracts from governments to carry mail as well as passengers and high-value cargo. Their services retained the name \"Packet\".\n\nPacket shipping companies included:\n\nIn the United States, \"packet trade\" is often used to refer to the Atlantic (or \"Western\") Ocean packets which traded with Europe and Africa (notably Cape Verde). Packet boats, smaller vessels designed for domestic use, also were extensively used in the 19th century for internal mail and scheduled service using rivers and canals, such as along the Erie Canal, which cut travel time across New York state in half; the Pennsylvania Canal, the James River and Kanawha Canal, and navigable rivers.\n\nDuring the 18th century ships carrying cargo, passengers and mail between Europe and America would sail only when they were full. Starting in the early 19th century, as trade with America became more common, schedule regularity became a priority.\n\nIn 1818, ships of the \"Black Ball\" line began regularly scheduled trips between Britain and the United States. These \"packet ships\" (named for their delivery of mail \"packets\") were infamous for keeping to their disciplined schedules. This often involved harsh treatment of seamen and earned the ships the nickname \"bloodboat\".\n\nThe original Black Ball Line was founded by a group of New York Quakers, but later a rival service founded by James Baines of Liverpool also styled itself the Black Ball Line, despite the protests of the original company of that name.\n\nBecause of the influence of whaling and several local droughts, there was substantial migration from Cape Verde to America, most notably to New Bedford, Massachusetts. This migration built strong ties between the two locations. A strong packet trade between New England and Cape Verde developed during the early-to-mid-19th century.\n\nIn the 21st century, ePacket delivery became available through the US Postal Service as a deal with China Post, Hongkong Post, and the Korean postal service in order to support internet commerce between East Asia and the United States. Vendors in those countries can sell goods directly to American customers while enjoying delivery rates that are often less even than domestic US vendors would pay to deliver the same parcel. These low rates and the current lack of protective tariffs on imported goods from foreign countries make the service controversial because it apparently gives foreign vendors, especially in mainland China and Hong Kong, a competitive advantage in the still-growing online market. The USPS has complained of inability to effectively negotiate prices with the Chinese postal services, and was losing millions of dollars on the service each year.\n\nThe first seagoing ship built in Van Diemens Land (in 1812) was named the \"Henrietta Packet\" by virtue of the fact that she offered a regular passenger service between Hobart, Tasmania and Sydney, New South Wales. From the 1830s the term \"steam packet\" was commonly applied to early steam ship services that, at least in theory, offered a regular and reliable service, and is perpetuated today by many waterfront establishments around Australia bearing such names as the \"Steam Packet Inn\" or \"Steam Packet Hotel\".\n\nBoth fast sailing ships and early steam ships holding mail contracts between Great Britain and Australia were also often referred to as packets. These included several ships of James Baines' Black Ball Line and the Orient Line.\n\nIn the late 15th to mid 16th century the Dutch system of the beurtvaart developed, a related system for mostly inland navigation. Ships of the beurtvaart carried passengers, livestock and freight along fixed routes at fixed prices with scheduled departures. Organised by the cities, it grew to an extensive and reliable network over the following century. Some of the cities arranged for international (seagoing) connections as well.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century authorities withdrew from intervening and a lot of steamship companies sprang up, offering much the same services. Some carried freight and livestock only, some of them were mainly for passenger transport, becoming more like public transport. They would call their service beurtvaart or occasionally use the word 'packet' as did Alkmaar Packet.\n\n\n"}

Developed by Western missionaries working among the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia in the 19th century and refined by missionaries working in Xiamen and Tainan, it uses a modified Latin alphabet and some diacritics to represent the spoken language. After initial success in Fujian, POJ became most widespread in Taiwan and, in the mid-20th century, there were over 100,000 people literate in POJ. A large amount of printed material, religious and secular, has been produced in the script, including Taiwan's first newspaper, the \"Taiwan Church News\".\n\nOther related scripts include Pha̍k-oa-chhi for Gan, Pha̍k-fa-sṳ for Hakka, Bǽh-oe-tu for Hainanese, Bàng-uâ-cê for Foochow, and Pêh-uē-jī for Teochew.\n\nDuring Taiwan under Japanese rule (1895–1945), the use of Pe̍h-ōe-jī was suppressed and it faced further countermeasures during the Kuomintang martial law period (1947–1987). In Fujian, use declined after the establishment of the People's Republic of China (1949) and in the early 21st century the system was not in general use there. Taiwanese Christians, non-native learners of Southern Min, and native-speaker enthusiasts in Taiwan are among those that continue to use \"Pe̍h-ōe-jī\". Full native computer support was developed in 2004, and users can now call on fonts, input methods, and extensive online dictionaries. Rival writing systems have evolved, and there is ongoing debate within the Taiwanese mother tongue movement as to which system should be used. Versions of \"pe̍h-ōe-jī\" have been devised for other Chinese varieties, including Hakka and Teochew Southern Min.\n\nIn the 2006, the Taiwanese Romanization System was developed based on \"pe̍h-ōe-jī\" for official use to write Hokkien phonetically.\n\nThe name \"pe̍h-ōe-jī\" () means \"vernacular writing\", written characters representing everyday spoken language. The name \"vernacular writing\" could be applied to many kinds of writing, romanized and character-based, but the term \"pe̍h-ōe-jī\" is commonly restricted to the Southern Min romanization system developed by Presbyterian missionaries in the 19th century.\n\nThe missionaries who invented and refined the system used, instead of the name \"pe̍h-ōe-jī\", various other terms, such as \"Romanized Amoy Vernacular\" and \"Romanized Amoy Colloquial.\" The origins of the system and its extensive use in the Christian community have led to it being known by some modern writers as \"Church Romanization\" () and is often abbreviated in POJ itself to \"Kàu-lô\". () There is some debate on whether \"pe̍h-ōe-jī\" or \"Church Romanization\" is the more appropriate name.\n\nObjections to \"pe̍h-ōe-jī\" are that it can refer to more than one system and that both literary and colloquial register Southern Min appear in the system and so describing it as \"vernacular\" writing might be inaccurate. Objections to \"Church Romanization\" are that some non-Christians and some secular writing use it. One commentator observes that POJ \"today is largely disassociated from its former religious purposes.\" The term \"romanization\" is also disliked by some, who see it as belittling the status of \"pe̍h-ōe-jī\" by identifying it as a supplementary phonetic system instead of a fully-fledged orthography. Sources disagree on which of the two is more commonly used.\n\nThe history of Peh-oe-ji has been heavily influenced by official attitudes towards the Southern Min vernaculars and the Christian organizations that propagated it. Early documents point to the purpose of the creation of POJ as being pedagogical in nature, closely allied to educating Christian converts.\n\nThe first people to use a romanized script to write Southern Min were Spanish missionaries in Manila in the 16th century. However, it was used mainly as a teaching aid for Spanish learners of Southern Min, and seems not to have had any influence on the development of \"pe̍h-ōe-jī\". In the early 19th century, China was closed to Christian missionaries, who instead proselytized to overseas Chinese communities in South East Asia. The earliest origins of the system are found in a small vocabulary first printed in 1820 by Walter Henry Medhurst, who went on to publish the \"Dictionary of the Hok-këèn Dialect of the Chinese Language, According to the Reading and Colloquial Idioms\" in 1832.\n\nThis dictionary represents the first major reference work in POJ, although the romanization within was quite different from the modern system, and has been dubbed \"Early Church Romanization\" by one scholar of the subject. Medhurst, who was stationed in Malacca, was influenced by Robert Morrison's romanization of Mandarin Chinese, but had to innovate in several areas to reflect major differences between Mandarin and Southern Min. Several important developments occurred in Medhurst's work, especially the application of consistent tone markings (influenced by contemporary linguistic studies of Sanskrit, which was becoming of more mainstream interest to Western scholars). Medhurst was convinced that accurate representation and reproduction of the tonal structure of Southern Min was vital to comprehension:\nThe system expounded by Medhurst influenced later dictionary compilers with regard to tonal notation and initials, but both his complicated vowel system and his emphasis on the literary register of Southern Min were dropped by later writers. Following on from Medhurst's work, Samuel Wells Williams became the chief proponent of major changes in the orthography devised by Morrison and adapted by Medhurst. Through personal communication and letters and articles printed in \"The Chinese Repository\" a consensus was arrived at for the new version of POJ, although Williams' suggestions were largely not followed.\n\nThe first major work to represent this new orthography was Elihu Doty's \"Anglo-Chinese Manual with Romanized Colloquial in the Amoy Dialect\", published in 1853. The manual can therefore be regarded as the first presentation of a pre-modern POJ, a significant step onwards from Medhurst's orthography and different from today's system in only a few details. From this point on various authors adjusted some of the consonants and vowels, but the system of tone marks from Doty's \"Manual\" survives intact in modern POJ. John Van Nest Talmage has traditionally been regarded as the founder of POJ among the community which uses the orthography, although it now seems that he was an early promoter of the system, rather than its inventor.\n\nIn 1842 the Treaty of Nanking was concluded, which included among its provisions the creation of treaty ports in which Christian missionaries would be free to preach. Xiamen (then known as Amoy) was one of these treaty ports, and British, Canadian and American missionaries moved in to start preaching to the local inhabitants. These missionaries, housed in the cantonment of Gulangyu, created reference works and religious tracts, including a bible translation. Naturally, they based the pronunciation of their romanization on the speech of Xiamen, which became the de facto standard when they eventually moved into other areas of the Hokkien Sprachraum, most notably Taiwan. The 1858 Treaty of Tianjin officially opened Taiwan to western missionaries, and missionary societies were quick to send men to work in the field, usually after a sojourn in Xiamen to acquire the rudiments of the language.\n\nQuanzhou and Zhangzhou are two major varieties of Southern Min, and in Xiamen they combined to form something \"not Quan, not Zhang\" – i.e. not one or the other, but rather a fusion, which became known as \"Amoy Dialect\" or \"Amoy Chinese\". In Taiwan, with its mixture of migrants from both Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, the linguistic situation was similar; although the resulting blend in the southern city of Tainan differed from the Xiamen blend, it was close enough that the missionaries could ignore the differences and import their system wholesale.\n\nThe fact that religious tracts, dictionaries, and teaching guides already existed in the Xiamen tongue meant that the missionaries in Taiwan could begin proselytizing immediately, without the intervening time needed to write those materials.\n\nMissionary opinion was divided on whether POJ was desirable as an end in itself as a full-fledged orthography, or as a means to literacy in Chinese characters. William Campbell described POJ as a step on the road to reading and writing the characters, claiming that to promote it as an independent writing system would inflame nationalist passions in China, where characters were considered a sacred part of Chinese culture. Taking the other side, Thomas Barclay believed that literacy in POJ should be a goal rather than a waypoint:\nA great boon to the promotion of POJ in Taiwan came in 1880 when James Laidlaw Maxwell, a medical missionary based in Tainan, donated a small printing press to the local church, which Thomas Barclay learned how to operate in 1881 before founding the Presbyterian Church Press in 1884. Subsequently, the \"Taiwan Prefectural City Church News\", which first appeared in 1885 and was produced by Barclay's Presbyterian Church of Taiwan Press, became the first printed newspaper in Taiwan.\n\nAs other authors made their own alterations to the conventions laid down by Medhurst and Doty, \"pe̍h-ōe-jī\" evolved and eventually settled into its current form. Ernest Tipson's 1934 pocket dictionary was the first reference work to reflect this modern spelling. Between Medhurst's dictionary of 1832 and the standardization of POJ in Tipson's time, there were a number of works published, which can be used to chart the change over time of \"pe̍h-ōe-jī\":\nCompetition for POJ was introduced during the Japanese era in Taiwan (1895–1945) in the form of Taiwanese kana, a system designed as a teaching aid and pronunciation guide, rather than an independent orthography like POJ. From the 1930s onwards, with the increasing militarization of Japan and the movement encouraging Taiwanese people to \"Japanize\", there were a raft of measures taken against native languages, including Taiwanese. While these moves resulted in a suppression of POJ, they were \"a logical consequence of increasing the amount of education in Japanese, rather than an explicit attempt to ban a particular Taiwanese orthography in favor of Taiwanese kana\".\n\nThe Second Sino-Japanese War beginning in 1937 brought stricter measures into force, and along with the outlawing of romanized Taiwanese, various publications were prohibited and Confucian-style \"shobō\" () – private schools which taught Classical Chinese with literary Southern Min pronunciation – were closed down in 1939. The Japanese authorities came to perceive POJ as an obstacle to Japanization and also suspected that POJ was being used to hide \"concealed codes and secret revolutionary messages\". In the climate of the ongoing war the government banned the \"Taiwan Church News\" in 1942 as it was written in POJ.\n\nInitially the Kuomintang government in Taiwan had a liberal attitude towards \"local dialects\" (i.e. non-Mandarin varieties of Chinese). The National Languages Committee produced booklets outlining versions of Bopomofo for writing the Taiwanese tongue, these being intended for newly arrived government officials from outside Taiwan as well as local Taiwanese. The first government action against native languages came in 1953, when the use of Taiwanese or Japanese for instruction was forbidden. The next move to suppress the movement came in 1955, when the use of POJ for proselytizing was outlawed. At that point in time there were 115,000 people literate in POJ in Taiwan, Fujian, and southeast Asia.\n\nTwo years later, missionaries were banned from using romanized bibles, and the use of \"native languages\" (i.e. Taiwanese Hakka, Hakka, and the non-Sinitic Formosan languages) in church work became illegal. The ban on POJ bibles was overturned in 1959, but churches were \"encouraged\" to use character bibles instead. Government activities against POJ intensified in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when several publications were banned or seized in an effort to prevent the spread of the romanization. In 1964 use of Taiwanese in schools or official settings was forbidden, and transgression in schools punished with beatings, fines and humiliation. The \"Taiwan Church News\" (printed in POJ) was banned in 1969, and only allowed to return a year later when the publishers agreed to print it in Chinese characters.\n\nIn 1974, the Government Information Office banned \"A Dictionary of Southern Min\", with a government official saying: \"We have no objection to the dictionary being used by foreigners. They could use it in mimeographed form. But we don't want it published as a book and sold publicly because of the Romanization it contains. Chinese should not be learning Chinese through Romanization.\" Also in the 1970s, a POJ New Testament translation known as the \"Red Cover Bible\" (\"Âng-phoê Sèng-keng\") was confiscated and banned by the Nationalist regime. Official moves against native languages continued into the 1980s, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of the Interior decided in 1984 to forbid missionaries to use \"local dialects\" and romanizations in their work.\n\nWith the ending of martial law in 1987, the restrictions on \"local languages\" were quietly lifted, resulting in growing interest in Taiwanese writing during the 1990s. For the first time since the 1950s, Taiwanese language and literature was discussed and debated openly in newspapers and journals. There was also support from the then opposition party, the Democratic Progressive Party, for writing in the language. From a total of 26 documented orthographies for Taiwanese in 1987 (including defunct systems), there were a further 38 invented from 1987 to 1999, including 30 different romanizations, six adaptations of \"bopomofo\" and two hangul-like systems. Some commentators believe that the Kuomintang, while steering clear of outright banning of the native language movements after the end of martial law, took a \"divide and conquer\" approach by promoting Taiwanese Language Phonetic Alphabet (TLPA), an alternative to POJ, which was at the time the choice of the majority inside the nativization movement.\n\nNative language education has remained a fiercely debated topic in Taiwan into the 21st century and is the subject of much political wrangling.\n\nThe current system of \"pe̍h-ōe-jī\" has been stable since the 1930s, with a few minor exceptions (detailed below). There is a fair degree of similarity with the Vietnamese alphabet, including the distinction and the use of in Vietnamese compared with in POJ. POJ uses the following letters and combinations:\n\nChinese phonology traditionally divides syllables in Chinese into three parts; firstly the \"initial\", a consonant or consonant blend which appears at the beginning of the syllable, secondly the \"final\", consisting of a \"medial vowel\" (optional), a \"nucleus vowel\", and an optional \"ending\"; and finally the tone, which is applied to the whole syllable. In terms of the non-tonal (i.e. phonemic) features, the \"nucleus vowel\" is the only required part of a licit consonant in Chinese varieties. Unlike Mandarin but like other southern varieties of Chinese, Taiwanese has final stop consonants with no audible release, a feature that has been preserved from Middle Chinese. There is some debate as to whether these stops are a tonal feature or a phonemic one, with some authorities distinguishing between as a tonal feature, and , , and as phonemic features. Southern Min dialects also have an optional nasal property, which is written with a superscript and usually identified as being part of the vowel.\n\nA legitimate syllable in Hokkien takes the form codice_1, where items in parenthesis indicate optional components.\n\nThe initials are:\n\nVowels:\n\nCoda endings:\nPOJ has a limited amount of legitimate syllables, although sources disagree on some particular instances of these syllables. The following table contains all the licit spellings of POJ syllables, based on a number of sources:\n\nIn standard Amoy or Taiwanese Hokkien there are seven distinct tones, which by convention are numbered 1–8, with number 6 omitted (tone 6 used to be a distinct tone, but has long since merged with tone 2). Tones 1 and 4 are both represented without a diacritic, and can be distinguished from each other by the syllable ending, which is a vowel, , , or for tone 1, and , , , and for tone 4.\n\nSouthern Min dialects undergo considerable tone sandhi, i.e. changes to the tone depending on the position of the syllable in any given sentence or utterance. However, like pinyin for Mandarin Chinese, POJ always marks the citation tone (i.e. the original, pre-sandhi tone) rather than the tone which is actually spoken. This means that when reading aloud the reader must adjust the tone markings on the page to account for sandhi. Some textbooks for learners of Southern Min mark both the citation tone and the sandhi tone to assist the learner.\n\nThere is some debate as to the correct placement of tone marks in the case of diphthongs and triphthongs, particularly those which include and . Most modern writers follow six rules:\n\n\nA single hyphen is used to indicate a compound. What constitutes a compound is controversial, with some authors equating it to a \"word\" in English, and others not willing to limit it to the English concept of a word. Examples from POJ include \"forty\", \"circus\", and \"recover (from illness)\". The rule-based sandhi behaviour of tones in compounds has not yet been clearly defined by linguists. A double hyphen is used when POJ is deployed as an orthography (rather than as a transcription system) to indicate that the following syllable should be pronounced in the neutral tone. It also marks to the reader that the preceding syllable does not undergo tone sandhi, as it would were the following syllable non-neutral. Morphemes following a double hyphen are often (but not always) grammatical function words.\n\nIn addition to the standard syllables detailed above, there are several regional variations of Hokkien which can be represented with non-standard or semi-standard spellings. In the Zhangzhou dialect, spoken in Zhangzhou, parts of Taiwan (particularly the northeastern coast around Yilan City) and parts of Malaysia (particularly in Penang), there is a final , for example in \"egg\" and \"cooked rice\" , which has merged with in mainstream Taiwanese. The Zhangzhou dialect also has the vowel /ɛ/, written as or (with a dot above right, by analogy with ), which has merged with in mainstream Taiwanese.\n\nDue to POJ's origins in the church, much of the material in the script is religious in nature, including several Bible translations, books of hymns, and guides to morality. The Tainan Church Press, established in 1884, has been printing POJ materials ever since, with periods of quiet when POJ was suppressed in the early 1940s and from around 1955 to 1987. In the period to 1955, over 2.3 million volumes of POJ books were printed, and one study in 2002 catalogued 840 different POJ texts in existence. Besides in the orthography, there are teaching materials, religious texts, and books about linguistics, medicine and geography.\n\nPOJ was initially not well supported by word-processing applications due to the special diacritics needed to write it. Support has now improved and there are now sufficient resources to both enter and display POJ correctly. Several input methods exist to enter Unicode-compliant POJ, including OpenVanilla (OS X and Microsoft Windows), the cross-platform Tai-lo Input Method released by the Taiwanese Ministry of Education, and the Firefox add-on Transliterator, which allows in-browser POJ input. When POJ was first used in word-processing applications it was not fully supported by the Unicode standard, thus necessitating work-arounds. One employed was encoding the necessary characters in the \"Private Use\" section of Unicode, but this required both the writer and the reader to have the correct custom font installed. Another solution was to replace troublesome characters with near equivalents, for example substituting for or using a standard followed by an interpunct to represent . With the introduction into Unicode 4.1.0 of the combining character in 2004, all the necessary characters were present to write regular POJ without the need for workarounds. However, even after the addition of these characters, there are still relatively few fonts which are able to properly render the script, including the combining characters. Some of those which can are Charis SIL, DejaVu, Doulos SIL, Linux Libertine, Taigi Unicode, and Source Sans Pro.\n\nOne of the most popular modern ways of writing Taiwanese is by using a mixed orthography called Hàn-lô (; literally \"Chinese-Roman\"), and sometimes \"Han-Romanization mixed script\", a style not unlike written Japanese or (historically) Korean. In fact, the term Hàn-lô does not describe one specific system, but covers any kind of writing in Southern Min which features both Chinese characters and romanization. That romanization is usually POJ, although recently some texts have begun appearing with Taiwanese Romanization System (Tâi-lô) spellings too. The problem with using only Chinese characters to write Southern Min is that there are many morphemes (estimated to be around 15 percent of running text) which are not definitively associated with a particular character. Various strategies have been developed to deal with the issue, including creating new characters, allocating Chinese characters used in written Mandarin with similar meanings (but dissimilar etymology) to represent the missing characters, or using romanization for the \"missing 15%\". There are two rationales for using mixed orthography writing, with two different aims. The first is to allow native speakers (almost all of whom can already write Chinese characters) to make use of their knowledge of characters, while replacing the missing 15% with romanization. The second is to wean character literates off using them gradually, to be replaced eventually by fully romanized text.\nExamples of modern texts in Hàn-lô include religious, pedagogical, scholarly, and literary works, such as:\n\nPOJ has been adapted for several other varieties of Chinese, with varying degrees of success. For Hakka, missionaries and others have produced a Bible translation, hymn book, textbooks, and dictionaries. Materials produced in the orthography, called Pha̍k-fa-sṳ, include:\nA modified version of POJ has also been created for Teochew.\n\nMost native Southern Min speakers in Taiwan are unfamiliar with POJ or any other writing system, commonly asserting that \"Taiwanese has no writing\", or, if they are made aware of POJ, considering romanization as the \"low\" form of writing, in contrast with the \"high\" form (Chinese characters). For those who are introduced to POJ alongside Han-lo and completely Chinese character-based systems, a clear preference has been shown for all-character systems, with all-romanization systems at the bottom of the preference list, likely because of the preexisting familiarity of readers with Chinese characters.\n\nPOJ remains the Taiwanese orthography \"with the richest inventory of written work, including dictionaries, textbooks, literature [...] and other publications in many areas\". A 1999 estimate put the number of literate POJ users at around 100,000, and secular organizations have been formed to promote the use of romanization among Taiwanese speakers.\n\nOutside Taiwan, POJ is rarely used. For example, in Fujian, Xiamen University uses a romanization known as Bbánlám pìngyīm, based on Pinyin. In other areas where Hokkien is spoken, such as Singapore, the Speak Mandarin Campaign is underway to actively discourage people from speaking Hokkien or other non-Mandarin varieties in favour of switching to Mandarin instead.\n\nIn 2006, Taiwan's Ministry of Education chose an official romanization for use in teaching Southern Min in the state school system. POJ was one of the candidate systems, along with Daighi tongiong pingim, but a compromise system, the Taiwanese Romanization System or \"Tâi-Lô\", was chosen in the end. Tâi-Lô retains most of the orthographic standards of POJ, including the tone marks, while changing the troublesome character for , swapping for , and replacing in diphthongs with . Supporters of Taiwanese writing are in general deeply suspicious of government involvement, given the history of official suppression of native languages, making it unclear whether Tâi-Lô or POJ will become the dominant system in the future.\n\nGeneral\n\nInput methods\n\nPOJ-compliant fonts\n\nTexts and dictionaries\n\n"}

She was ordered from Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson Ltd under the 14th Order for Destroyers in the Emergency War Program of 1918–19. She was the first ship to carry the name.\n\nHMS \"Whitshed\"s keel was laid on 3 June 1918 at the Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson Ltd. at Wallsend on Tyne. She was launched on 31 January 1919. She was overall in length with a beam of . Her mean draught was , and would reach under full load. She had a displacement of 1,140 tons standard and up to 1,550 full load.\n\nShe was propelled by three Yarrow water tube boilers powering Brown-Curtis geared steam turbines developing 27,000 SHP driving two screws for a maximum designed speed of 34 knots. She was oil-fired and had a bunkerage of 320 to 370 tons. This gave a range of between 3500 nautical miles at 15 knots and 900 nautical miles at 32 knots.\n\nShe shipped four BL 4.7 in (120-mm) Mk.I guns, mount P Mk.I naval guns in four single centre-line turrets. The turrets were disposed as two forward and two aft in super imposed firing positions. She also carried two QF 2 pdr Mk.II \"pom-pom\" (40 mm L/39) mounted abeam between funnels. Abaft of the second funnel, she carried six 21-inch Torpedo Tubes in triple mounts on the centre-line.\n\nHMS \"Whitshed\" was commissioned on 11 July 1919 into the Royal Navy with pennant number FA7. She was assigned to the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla in the Atlantic Fleet. In October 1919 she was assigned the pennant number D77 under a simplification of the pennant number system. The Flotilla served in Home waters in the early 1920s. The Flotilla was first assigned to the Mediterranean and in 1926 to the China Station. She was involved in the Nanking Incident in March 1927. When the United States Navy gunboat was heavily damaged by fire while at sea off China on 14 March 1934, \"Whitshed\", her sister ship , and the merchant ship SS \"Tsinan\" came to \"Fulton\"s assistance. \"Wishart\" and \"Tsinan\" took off \"Fulton\"s crew, three of whom had suffered minor injuries, and took them to the Royal Navy Dockyard at Hong Kong while \"Whitshed\" stood by \"Fulton\" until a salvage party could put the fire out. The United States Department of the Navy later passed thanks to British naval authorities for the assistance \"Wishart\" and \"Whitshed\" provided to \"Fulton\" and her crew.\n\nLater in the 1930s, \"Whitshed\" was placed in reserve as more modern destroyers came on line.\n\nIn 1939, HMS \"Whitshed\" was reactivated and assigned to the 18th Destroyer Flotilla at Portland for convoy defence in the English Channel and South-West Approaches. On 30 January 1940, in conjunction with the sloop and an RAF Sunderland flying boat from No. 228 Squadron, \"Whitshed\" sank in the South-West Approaches whilst escorting convoy OA30G.\n\nIn April, she was transferred to the 19th Destroyer Flotilla at Dover to assist with support of operations off the Belgian and Dutch coasts. She took part in the demolition and evacuation of IJmuiden and Amsterdam (Operation XD(A)) in early May 1940. She then carried supplies to Dunkirk and embarked the Irish Guards before assisting in the evacuation of the Hook of Holland (Operation Ordnance) and Ostend in mid-May.\n\nOn 22 May, \"Whitshed\" escorted ships carrying troops of the 20th Guards Brigade to Boulogne in order to hold the town while evacuation operations took place, with \"Whitshed\" carrying anti-tank guns. On her return journey she carried RAF personnel, Prisoners of War and civilians back to England. She returned to Boulogne on 23 May as evacuation operations continued, picking up wounded troops and shelling German forces before being damaged by German bombers, with one killed and 13 wounded. Later that evening, when some air cover was available, \"Whitshed\" along with sister ship , reentered Boulogne, with each ship embarking over 550 men. On the 26th she deployed for the evacuation of Allied troops from Dunkirk (Operation Dynamo). At this time her pennant number was changed to I77 for visual signalling purposes. Upon release from Op Dynamo she returned to Harwich and convoy defence, and anti-invasion patrols in the North Sea and English Channel. She was one of the few ships not damaged at Dunkirk.\n\nOn 31 July she sustained serious structural damage after detonating a mine off Harwich. towed her back to Harwich. She was under repair until December.\n\nThe year 1941 was one of continuing convoy escort and patrolling of the North Sea and English Channel. In February she escorted Motor Torpedo Boats for mine laying in the North Sea. The operation came under air attack with no casualties or damage.\n\nIn February 1942, \"Whitshed\" joined the destroyers and of the 21st Flotilla and , and of the 16th Flotilla. On the 12th, she carried out a torpedo attack on the German battleships and and heavy cruiser , which had broken out of Brest and proceeded via the Dover Straits to Wilhelmshaven in the Channel Dash.\n\nFor the remainder of 1942 and most of 1943, \"Whitshed\" undertook convoy escort duties and patrolled the North Sea and English Channel. In 1942, her ‘A’ gun was replaced with a twin 6-pounder army gun for engaging E-Boats. In November 1943 she was in action with E-Boats while escorting convoy CW221 off Hastings with two motor gun boats and four motor launches of the Coastal Forces. On 18 April 1944 she was in action again with E-Boats on a mine laying operation in the English Channel.\n\nIn June 1944 she joined Escort Group 104 with , and and escorted convoy EIL1 comprising 12 Landing Ship Tank (LST) and 24 Landing Craft Tank (LCT) from Southend to the assembly area of the Eastern Task Force. Then she returned to Southend to escort the build-up convoys.\n\nIn July she was released from Operation Neptune and resumed mercantile convoy escort and interception patrols engaging E-Boats and submersibles employed in mine laying operations in the North Sea and English Channel through April 1945. After VE-Day she was deployed in re-occupation operations. In June 1945 she was reduced to reserve status.\n\nHMS \"Whitshed\" was not deployed again operationally and after the end of hostilities she was paid off and reduced to reserve status. The ship was placed on the Disposal List in 1946. She was sold to BISCO in February 1947 for demolition by TJ King. The ship arrived at the breakers yard at Gateshead in April 1948.\n\n"}

{"id": "2225153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2225153", "title": "Armand Barbès", "text": "Armand Barbès\n\nArmand Barbès (18 September 1809 – 26 June 1870) was a French Republican revolutionary and a fierce and steadfast opponent of the July monarchy (1830–1848). He is remembered as a man whose life centers on two days:\n\n\nBarbès was again imprisoned, but he was pardoned by Napoleon III in 1854. He fled into exile in the Netherlands, where he died on 26 June 1870, only weeks before the end of the Second Empire in France.\n\nA most colorful character, he was nicknamed the \"Bayard of Democracy\", presumably in honor of the chevalier, Pierre Terrail, seigneur de Bayard (1476–1524). He was also known as the \"peerless conspirator\", and a modern historian has called him \"a man of action without a program.\" Barbès is today the very paradigm of the nineteenth-century \"romantic revolutionary\" type, courageous, generous, and a true democrat. He was called the \"scourge of the establishment\" by Karl Marx.\n\nBarbès was born into a middle-class family in Pointe-à-Pitre, Guadeloupe. His father, an army surgeon from Carcassonne in the département of Aude, was born in Capendu, also in Aude. He was a veteran of Napoleon's Egyptian campaign. Posted to Guadeloupe in 1801, he remained there until the fall of the First Empire in 1814.\n\nThe family returned to Carcassonne, and the eldest son of the doctor, Armand, eventually arrived in Carcassonne also, in 1830, the place of his revolutionary baptism. At twenty, Armand, disposed to a Republican point-of-view early in the development of his consciousness, was as physically strong as he was precocious of intellect. He had an imposing physique, and he was chosen to lead the local battalion of the National Guard during the 1830 revolution. The battalion was financed by the elder Barbès out of his own pocket.\n\nThe following year, Armand went to Paris to study medicine, but he found the very sight of blood repugnant. So, with a passion reminiscent of the Flaubert hero, Frédéric Moreau in \"Sentimental Education\" (1869), he threw himself, body and soul, into a study of the law. Like Moreau, Barbès experienced his parents' deaths at an early age. As a consequence, he was left a large inheritance, so large, in fact, that Barbès was relieved of the need to work to earn his living, and he became free to submit to the passion of his life: conspiring to overthrow the ruling regime, in this case, the July Monarchy.\n\nIn 1834, his membership in a Jacobin-leaning organization, the \"\" (Society for the Rights of Man), led to his first arrest. Released in early 1835, he served as a lawyer for 164 defendants indicted for republican insurgency during 1834, and, in July 1835, he assisted twenty-eight of them to escape from Sainte-Pelagie prison in Paris, an institution reserved for political troublemakers.\n\nIn 1834, the Society for the Rights of Man, at about the time of Barbès's arrest, was dismantled by the police. He responded by founding the short-lived \"Society of Avengers\", which was followed, the next year, by the \"League of Families\", the organization for which Barbès composed the oath of membership, a must for all aspiring conspirators. This was the beginning of his long and tumultuous \"collaboration\" with Louis Auguste Blanqui. On 10 March 1836, Barbès and Blanqui were arrested by the police while loading ammunition in the apartment they shared in Paris. Barbès, sentenced to one year imprisonment, was pardoned in 1837, and he spent several months, after his pardon, with his family in Carcassonne. There, he devised plans for a new secret society, and he wrote the brochure that will remain his only contribution to revolutionary literature, \"\"A Few Words to Those who Sympathize with Workers without Work\"\".\n\nWhen he returned to Paris in 1838, he joined with Blanqui and to form yet another republican secret society, the very proletarian .\n\nThe Society of Seasons was organized on the principle of a hierarchy of cells. A \"week\" was a group of six men and a leader. Four \"weeks\" made a \"month\" of twenty-eight \"days\" (actually, twenty-eight initiates, plus a leader.) Three months constituted a \"season\", and four \"seasons\" made a \"year\". At its height, the Society comprised more than three \"years\".\n\nThe founding of the Society of Seasons led directly to the Barbès-led insurrection of 12 May 1839. At this time, Barbès, Blanqui, and Martin were three Republicans cut from the same cloth. They were of the same generation, with the same youthful commitment to revolutionary struggle, and they shared a common experience of oppression, trials, and imprisonment. Then their paths diverged.\n\nOn 12 May 1839, the Society of Seasons and its approximately nine hundred members felt strong enough to attempt a coup d'état in Paris. Four hundred insurgents managed to seize the National Assembly, the city hall, and the Palace of Justice, but they were unable to maintain their grip for more than a few hours because of a lack of numbers and weapons. Following the failure of this insurrection, Barbès was sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to 'life imprisonment' largely due to the intervention of Victor Hugo. Also, these events led to a divorce between Barbès and Blanqui, which became a severe impediment to the extreme left during the revolution of 1848 and also later in the century.\n\nBarbès was sent to Mont-Saint-Michel on 17 July 1839 with three other convicts, including Martin Bernard, who left a detailed account of their time in prison. (Blanqui and five other insurgents joined them on 6 February 1840.)\n\nUpon their arrival, the inmates were fighting against the rigors of solitary confinement by maintaining a continuous din, from the windows, up the chimneys, and through the walls. Barbès, Bernard, and an old comrade, Delsade, managed, after repeated trials, to open the doors of their cells to meet. Discovered in April 1841, they were punished by imprisonment in the \"loges\" section of the prison, completely in view of the warder on duty. The prison administration then equipped their cells with double gates to prevent them from approaching the cross in what, after all, had been an abbey before its conversion to a high-security prison at the time of the French Revolution.\n\nOn the nights of 10 and 11 February 1842, Barbès, Blanqui and others attempted to escape, in fog, using a rope made of knotted sheets. Barbès was the first over the wall, but he was injured in the fall, and this doomed the escape attempt. All of them were reconfined in their cells. Shortly thereafter, Barbès contracted what he called \"consumption\" (tuberculosis), probably, in fact, persistent bronchitis brought on by the cold and damp of Mont-Saint-Michel.\n\nBlanqui, the \"prime mover\" of the 1839 coup, seems to have believed that Barbès, who had been away from revolutionary activities for a short while, lacked resolve, that he was exhausted from repeated discouragements, and that this attitude in Barbès disheartened his fellow insurgents, leading to a failure of the coup.\n\nIn fact, when he was released from prison in 1848, Barbès seemed to have regained his fervor, and he rallied the revolutionary left in a more moderate and pragmatic direction, to oppose Blanqui. Guided by Alphonse de Lamartine, he formed the \"Club of the Revolution\" to counteract Blanqui's \"Central Insurrection Society\", an organization prudently renamed the \"Central Republican Society\".\n\nOwing to his previous brief military experience in the Aude, Barbès was appointed colonel of the National Guard of the Twelfth District, and, ironically, he led his troops, on 16 April 1848, against a workers' demonstration led by Louis Blanc and Blanqui. Workers had demanded a more active social program and especially the postponement of the immanent elections to the constituent National Assembly. The protesters foresaw that the government had no time to \"educate\" the provincials, so the new Assembly would be dominated by Parisian conservatives and reactionaries.\n\nA month earlier, in March 1848, the hostility between Barbès and Blanqui had erupted with the publication in the mainstream press of the so-called \"document Taschereau\", said to be derived from police records. This document purportedly proved that Blanqui had betrayed his fellow conspirators during the 1839 coup. A goodly number of historians now consider it highly likely that this document was \"a false broadcast, in the form of leaks by the government\" to destabilize and undermine Blanqui. If so, it worked. Barbès apparently believed in the authenticity of this document, and this caused \"terrible divisions\" among those of the left, divisions still present at the end of the century.\n\nThe two men, who had become distrustful of one another, ended up hating each other with the same passion that had fueled their early revolutionary idealism. Nonetheless, both are major figures in the Republican pantheon, where they both enjoy a reputation as uncompromising revolutionaries, never diminished by the inevitable compromises necessitated by the exercise of power. Barbès, perhaps more thoughtful than his colleague, was fascinated by Blanqui, who was romantic, brave, but prone to impulses and inconsistencies. Beyond this fascination, Barbès hoped to channel the might of the volcanic Blanqui, but, he was, many suppose, secretly afraid of Blanqui's capacity for unreason and violence.\n\nReleased from prison in 1848, Barbès seemed to his contemporaries to be obsessed with thwarting Blanqui. Elected to the Constituent Assembly of 23 April 1848, Barbès, at the extreme left of the chamber, represented his native department of Aude. His parliamentary career was brief, however, since, on 15 May, demonstrators invaded the Assembly, under the pretext of presenting a petition urging the government to become more involved in the liberation of Poland. Barbès, initially opposed the demonstration, and he tried to disperse the crowd, but he seemed to lose his head when he saw Auguste Blanqui in the assembly chamber.\n\nIn an effort to seize the demonstration as a tool to bludgeon his enemy, he sparked a riot in front of the city hall, where a new, and more radical, republic was proclaimed. The insurgency was 'deflated' by itself when National Guard arrived to stop Barbes. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in April 1849 by the High Court of Justice, after he was found guilty of two major charges, an attack that aimed to overthrow the government, and incitement to civil war.\n\nLater, Karl Marx wrote in \"Class Struggles in France\": \"On 12 May [1848, the proletariat] sought unsuccessfully to regain its revolutionary influence, but only managed to deliver to the bourgeoisie's jailers their most energetic leaders.\" Modern historians have been even less kind: George Duveau, the historian, described the event as a \"tragic and absurd farce which had, from the beginning, no prospect of success\".\n\nBarbès showed an indomitable courage and chivalry, a taste for sacrifice, and an acceptance of his responsibilities. This certainly explains the charisma that was undeniably his; this view was common to all of his contemporaries, even his opponents. There is, nonetheless, an element of irrationality in the man that defies analysis, a \"\"mythe Barbès\"\" that continues to fascinate readers of history.\n\nSentenced to life imprisonment in 1849, Barbès was released by Napoleon III in 1854. However, he never returned to France. He had spent all but a few weeks of the previous fifteen years in confinement as a political prisoner. He realized that returning to French society would only tempt him to further political intrigues, so he withdrew into voluntary exile at the Hague, where he died on 26 June 1870, aged 60, just weeks before the Second Empire fell, the event that would, no doubt, have delighted him beyond all else.\n\nHe is buried in the private domain of Fourtou at Villalier, Aude.\n\n\n"}

Jones was given the nickname Mr Baldy for shaving his victims' hair and dressing them in female clothing during the attacks.\nHe pled guilty to 17 charges, including six of indecent assault on a male under 16, six of abduction, two of burglary and two of theft. He was sentenced to 14 years jail with a non-parole period of 12 years. After remissions of one-third, he was paroled in 1989 and he raped a nine-year-old-boy and sexually abused the victim's six-year-old brother within weeks. He was convicted of aggravated rape, sexual penetration of a child under 10 and three counts of indecent assault, and was sentenced in 1992 to 14 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 12 years to be served cumulatively with the balance of parole that he breached.\n\nUnder the terms of the sentence, Jones was eligible for parole in August 2003, and was eventually released from HM Prison Ararat in July 2005 with the strictest parole conditions ever given to a Victorian prisoner. The extended supervision order imposed 23 conditions, restricting his movements and contact with other people, and was to wear an electronic anklet to allow monitoring 24 hours a day. Jones was first settled in an undisclosed residential area, later revealed to be in the area, causing public outcry over his placement near to schools and playgrounds. After a vigil by protesters outside the house, Jones was moved from this address to a cottage within the perimeter of HM Prison Ararat.\n\nOn 7 August 2005, talk radio show host Derryn Hinch revealed Jones' living arrangements on air; Hinch's comments caused controversy in the Melbourne suburb of Frankston, where residents attacked the house named on air and abused its occupants, and a local supermarket began a petition to remove Jones from the area. Hinch later revealed his comments were mistaken and Jones was not living at the Frankston address.\n\nThe following day the Victorian government represented by Peter Faris applied to the County Court of Victoria for a 15-year supervision order under the Serious Sex Offenders Monitoring Act, enabling Jones to be supervised once his parole term expired. Jones appeared in court via video-link and did not contest the application.\n\nIn August 2006, Jones was caught wandering the streets of Ararat, in breach of his supervision order and was arrested by prison officers and was imprisoned indefinitely for multiple breaches of his parole conditions. For two weeks in 2008, power was lost to the electronic equipment set up to monitor Jones' movements. Authorities believed he deliberately disconnected the mains power supply to the monitoring unit in his cottage. In 2016 under supervision, he was attending the Salvation Army men's shed program.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2225180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2225180", "title": "Taveuni", "text": "Taveuni\n\nTaveuni (pronounced ) is the third-largest island in Fiji, after Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, with a total land area of . The cigar-shaped island, a massive shield volcano which rises from the floor of the Pacific Ocean, is situated to the east of Vanua Levu, across the Somosomo Strait. It belongs to the Vanua Levu Group of islands and is part of Fiji's Cakaudrove Province within the Northern Division.\n\nThe island had a population of around 19,000, some 75 per cent of them indigenous Fijians, at the 2015 census. Taveuni has abundant flora and is known as the 'Garden Island of Fiji'. It is a popular tourist destination. Tourists are attracted to the excellent diving opportunities, prolific bird life, bushwalks and waterfalls. Central parts of the island receive very high rainfall rates. Being volcanic in origin Taveuni's soils have supported the island's most historically significant industry, agriculture.\n\nTaveuni is located at the northern end of the Koro Sea, and is entirely the product of volcanic activity. Fiji's third largest island is separated from Vanua Levu by the Somosomo Strait. The island is between wide and long, is the top of a dormant, elongated shield volcano which erupted from a northeast-southwest trending rift on the ocean floor. About 150 volcanic cones dot the island, including Uluigalau, Fiji's second highest peak at , and Des Vœux Peak, next in height at . There have been at least 58 volcanic eruptions since the first human settlement around 950-750 BC, all of which affected the southern two-thirds of the island. Major eruptions from 300–500 AD caused abandonment of the southern areas until about 1100 AD. The latest eruption produced a lava flow at the southern tip of the island around 1550. The island's central ridge delineates the greatest volcanic activity surrounding volcanic vents.\n\nLake Tagimaucia is one of Taveuni's most famous tourist attractions. It occupies a volcanic crater at an altitude of , and is the habitat of the rare tagimaucia flower. Fiji's most famous waterfalls, the Bouma Falls, are also on the island, located in the Bouma National Heritage Park. South of Vuna village and the lagoon, jet black rocks litter an area known as the South Cape where Taveuni's last volcanic eruption spilled into the sea around 500 years ago. The highlight of the region is the Matamaiqi blowhole with geysers created by trade winds crashing into the volcanic rocks. About 20 minutes by foot from the town of Waiyevo is the Waitavala Waterslide. This entirely natural streambed chute plummets for about 50 metres down the lush hillside and is a favourite haunt for local children and brave tourists. In eastern Taveuni the Savulevu Yavonu Waterfall empties into the ocean. Tavoro Creek, Somosomo Creek, Waimbula River and the islands most notable waterways.\n\nMany of Taveuni's best known attractions lie underwater. There are three major, distinct diving areas around the island. To the north of Taveuni lie in close proximity the islands of Qamea and Matagi with their surrounding reef systems. The Rainbow Reef and Vuna Reef are famous for diving and snorkeling, respectively. The Rainbow Reef, on the western side in the narrow Somosomo Strait between Taveuni and Vanua Levu, is known as one of the world's premier soft coral dive areas and the soft coral capital of the world The horseshoe-shaped Vuna Lagoon, near the southern end of the island, is much appreciated among divers for the opportunity to see larger pelagic and schooling fish species on the exposed southern side of the reef, whereas the sheltered western parts provide pristine soft and hard coral gardens. Migrating humpback whales pass the island in July.\nOf interesting note is that the island of Taveuni crosses the east-west antimeridian so the \"north-eastern\" portion of the island is located at -179 degrees longitude and the south-western part at +179 degrees longitude. This is often an example that causes havoc to GIS software in which a polygon geometry around the perimeter of the island is incorrectly rendered and wraps around the globe.\n\nTo protect Fiji's wildlife, two sanctuaries have been created on the island of Taveuni, namely the Ravilevu Nature Reserve on the east coast, and the Taveuni Forest Reserve in the middle of the island. The potential to be nominated as a World Heritage Site contributes to the island's national significance as outlined in Fiji's Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan.\n\nThe population is concentrated mostly on the more sheltered western side of the island. Taveuni has eight major villages. Halfway down the west coast is the administrative centre of Waiyevo. The largest urban area, however, comprises the twin villages of Somosomo and Naqara. As the traditional fiefdom of the Tui Cakau, one of Fiji's highest-ranked chiefs, Somosomo is regarded as the capital of the Tovata Confederacy, while Naqara, an Indo-Fijian settlement, is the island's commercial centre. The main hospital is located at Waiyevo while a number of nursing stations and health centres are located around the island. Other settlements include Bouma, Deleni, Gacaavulu, Kanacea, Korovou, Lavena, Matei, Naselesele, Navakawau, Salialevu, Soqulu, Vuna, Wairiki, and Welagi.\n\nThe climate of Taveuni and Fiji is tropical without temperate extremes. It has been described as typical highland. Between November and April the area is prone to tropical cyclones. Rainfall rates on the island are high because the central mountains produce precipitation by orographic uplift. As much as of rain falls annually on the eastern side of the island, but the western side is sheltered from the southeast trade winds by the ridge that runs the length of the island. The central ridge experiences a wet upland climate which supports montane and submontane forests. Near Mount Koroturanga, 9,970 mm of mean, annual rainfall has been recorded. A 2011 study identified coastal erosion, flooding and water availability and supply as the most significant impacts of climate change on some of the villages on Taveuni.\n\nIn 1643, Abel Tasman became the first European to sight Taveuni. Visibility was poor and he mistook the peaks of Taveuni to be separate islands. Historically, Vuna was considered to be the paramount village on Taveuni when the Tui Cakau (Ratu Yavala) resided there, but tribal warfare eventually established the supremacy of Somosomo. In the late 1860s, the Tongan warlord Enele Ma'afu, who had conquered the Lau Islands, was defeated by the Tui Cakau's army in a skirmish at Somosomo. Several islands that sided with Ma'afu were sold by the Tui Cakau at that time to European settlers in punishment, and their inhabitants were moved to Taveuni. The villages of Lovonivonu and Kanacea are populated by their descendants.\n\nIn fact, Enele Ma'afu was not defeated by the Tui Cakau's army as stated above. He was in Tonga at that time. In July 1862: Ma’afu went for a visit to Tonga with Tui Bua to seek resolution about his campaign in Fiji with Tongan Parliament. During his absence, Wainiqolo, one of his lieutenants waged war on Golea. Wainiqolo was shot dead on the beach at Wairiki and the Tongans were slaughtered.\n\nWainiqolo had taken Tui Cakau prisoner when Golea was involved in an internal Cakaudrove campaign. It was an opportune time by Wainiqolo to initiate his campaign whilst Golea was involved in an internal struggle on Vanualevu. Ma’afu never forgave Wainiqolo for the act that he did and removed all land allocated to him. Historians saw this anger as confirmation that Ma’afu was not part of the Wainiqolo plot to conquer Tui Cakau while he was away in Tonga. The unprovoked attack by Wainiqolo was regarded by the Tui Cakau as cancelling his obligation to respect the right of Ma’afu to islands which had been formerly part of Cakaudrove chiefdom. Golea proceeded to resell the whole of Vanuabalavu to Europeans.\n\nOn 3 February 1865, a Court of Arbitration was convened by British Consul Jones who handed down the Court's decision that Ma’afu was the lawful owner of Vanuabalavu and associated islands. Ma’afu immediately executed an affidavit the following day to the effect that Vanuabalavu and all the other lands given to him. The life of Enele Ma'afu the Tui Lau has been documented in \"Summary of Key Historical Events\". Na Tikina Makawa o Vuna was not defeated by Somosomo as the above statement reads. In fact, historically Taveuni was owned and controlled by two distinct Chieftainship, Tikina o Vuna from the south, and one on the north of Taveuni. The Tui Cakau has his land over water opposite Taveuni island and the central part of Taveuni.\n\nIn 1876, a horse tramway was constructed on the Selia Levu estate to transport sugar cane to a mill.\n\nThe Taveuni F.C. was founded in 1947. Bouma Forest Park, later renamed to Bouma National Heritage Park was established in 1990 after landowning clans became concerned by the threat of logging. The reserve has expanded to cover roughly one third of the island. In January 2003, Severe Tropical Cyclone Ami crossed the island. In January 2008, Cyclone Gene caused widespread damage on the island. In March 2010, the island was hit by Severe Tropical Cyclone Tomas. The eye of the storm passed within 30 km of the island and produced a significant tidal surge and high waves.\n\nNearly all plants and animals indigenous to Fiji are found on Taveuni, which has suffered less devastation from land clearance than other areas of Fiji. The absence of the mongoose, a major predator, has also played a part in the survival on Taveuni of land crabs, the unique Fiji fruit bat, the Taveuni silk bat, and some unique species of palm. The island is the second largest in the Pacific Ocean to be free from the mongoose. Other species found on the island include the Fiji banded iguana and both \"Platymantis vitiensis\" and \"P. vitianus\" frog species. The critically endangered Fijian monkey-faced bat is found only on Taveuni. It was discovered by scientists in 1977. The flowering plant \"Balaka seemannii\", which is endemic to Fiji, is found on the island.\n\nThe green iguana or American iguana has been introduced to the Fijian islands. The lizard poses a threat because it has no natural enemies, can reach a high population density, eats the taro plant and because it carries \"Salmonella\" bacteria which can be transferred to humans if bitten. In 2013, an eradication program coordinated by the Biosecurity Authority of Fiji saw a bounty placed on both adult and juvenile American iguanas as well as their eggs.\n\nTaveuni is also home to the Taveuni beetle, maroon shining parrot, Fiji goshawk, azure-crested flycatcher, Fiji white-eye, Fiji parrot finch, orange dove and the kula parrot, and the Australian magpie, introduced to control coconut pests, has proliferated on the island. The critically endangered red-throated lorikeet has been found here. In total, 22 regional endemic bird species have been recorded on Taveuni. The total number of bird species found on the island is closer to 100.\n\nThe island's agricultural output is a significant contributor to the Fijian economy.\n\nCopra has been traditionally the most important crop produced on Taveuni, and has always been the staple of the local economy. In recent times farmers have mainly shifted to growing taro, kava and other speciality crops like vanilla, along with tropical fruit and coffee. During the American Civil War (1861–1865), cotton was raised on Taveuni and exported to Europe. Sugarcane was also grown for a brief period. Livestock such as sheep, cattle and poultry are also raised, but animal husbandry lags behind crop production in economic importance. In recent times, tourism has become a contributor to the local economy, with about a dozen small resorts providing accommodation options for visitors and employment and business opportunities to the local population.\n\nThe Taveuni dialect of Fijian reflects Tongan influence. One of its most distinctive features is the replacement of the consonant 'k' by a glottal stop. The \"Tui Cakau\" is therefore known locally as the \"Tui Ca'au.\"\n\nTaveuni notable peoples of high birth, other settler societies or ordinary Fijian (Indigenous) residents can be traced back to the era before European contact through to Deed of Cession of Fiji with Great Britain to Fiji Independence and today 2017. Taveuni has 5 main key main villages which has their own Paramount Chiefs. These Chiefs are crucial in keeping their people informed of changes and updates on developments in Fiji. These are those that have helped shaped Taveuni and holding together its people together. Perhaps the best-known Taveuni resident internationally was Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau (1918–1993), Fiji's last Governor-General and first President, who was also \"Tui Cakau\". The Ganilau family is a branch of the Ai Sokula clan, to which the present \"Tui Cakau\" and former Cabinet Minister Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu also belongs. Another notable Taveunian is Fiji's previous First Lady, Adi Salaseini Kavunono, wife of President Ratu Josefa Iloilo (2000-2009). Ratu Jone Yavala Kubuabola served as Fiji's Minister for Finance from 2000 to 2006. He was also a former Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji.\n\nRatu Inoke Kubuabola (younger brother of Ratu Jone Yavala Kubuabola) is a Fijian politician who served as Leader of the Opposition in 1999 and 2000. He became leader of the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei, or SVT, following its defeat in the 1999 election and the subsequent resignation of its leader, the defeated Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, from Parliament. Kubuabola served as Fiji's High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea from 2002 to 2005. In late 2005, he attempted to handle the problem of Fijian security guards, whom some accused of being mercenaries, operating illegally on the island of Bougainville. The incident embarrassed the Fijian government and threatened to strain relations between the two countries. On 4 May 2006 Kubuabola was posted to Tokyo as Fiji's Ambassador to Japan and Korea, replacing Ratu Tevita Momoedonu. He remained in this position until July 2009; on 24 July, he was named Minister for Foreign Affairs by the Interim Government, a position he still holds . The Kubuabola family is a branch of the Ai Sokula clan.\n\nIsikeli Vuruna, a rugby union footballer, was born on Taveuni.\n\nBoth \"Avengers of the Reef\" and \"Return to the Blue Lagoon\" were partially filmed on the island.\n\n\n"}

In specific, since the fire has a basic role in this event, the latter meaning (i.e. the scarlet) might make more sense. Local varieties of the name of the festival include Azerbaijani (in Ardabil), Kurdish and (in Kurdistan), and Isfahani Persian (in Isfahan). To the Yezidi Kurds, it is known as .\n\nBefore the start of the festival, people gather brushwood in an open, free exterior space. At sunset, after making one or more bonfires, they jump over the flames, singing , literally meaning \"[let] your ruddiness [be] mine, my paleness yours\", or a local equivalent of it. This is considered a purificatory practice.\n\nCharshanbe Suri includes a custom similar to trick-or-treating that is called (), literally translated as \"spoon-banging\". It is observed by people wearing disguises and going door-to-door to hit spoons against plates or bowls and receive packaged snacks.\n\nThe festival has its origin in ancient Iranian rituals. The ancient Iranians celebrated the festival of Hamaspathmaedaya (), the last five days of the year in honor of the spirits of the dead, which is today referred to as \"Farvardinegan\". They believed that the spirits of the dead would come for reunion. The seven holy immortals () were honored, and were bidden a formal ritual farewell at the dawn of the New Year. The festival also coincided with festivals celebrating the creation of fire and humans. By the time of the Sasanian Empire, the festival was divided into two distinct pentads, known as the lesser and the greater . The belief had gradually developed that the \"lesser \" belonged to the souls of children and those who died without sin, while the \"greater \" was for all souls.\n\nA custom once in vogue in Tehran was to seek the intercession of the so-called \"Pearl Cannon\" () on the occasion of Charshanbe Suri. This heavy gun, which was cast by the foundry-man Ismāil Isfahāni in 1800, under the reign of Fath-Ali Shah of the Qajar dynasty, became the focus of many popular myths. Until the 1920s, it stood in Arg Square (, ), to which the people of Tehran used to flock on the occasion of Charshanbe Suri. Spinsters and childless or unhappy wives climbed up and sat on the barrel or crawled under it, and mothers even made ill-behaved and troublesome children pass under it in the belief that doing so would cure their naughtiness. These customs died out in the 1920s, when the Pearl Cannon was moved to the Army's Officers' Club. There was also another Pearl Cannon in Tabriz. Girls and women used to fasten their \"dakhil\"s (\"pieces of a paper or cloth inscribed with wishes and prayers\") to its barrel on the occasion of Charshanbe Suri. In times, the cannon had been used as a sanctuary for political or non-political fugitives to be immune to arrest or to protest from family problems.\n\nSadegh Hedayat, an Iranian writer of prose fiction and short stories, has a book with the name of this cannon, , that criticize the old beliefs in Iranian folklore. The book also mentions the origin of the Pearl Cannon.\n\nToday, the Pearl Cannon is placed in the opening of the Building Number 7 of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 30th Tir Avenue, and the Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran is still in argument with the ministry to displace the gun to a museum.\n\n\n"}

The 16th-century Kinnaird Castle was converted in 1787 for use as the Kinnaird Head Lighthouse, the first lighthouse in Scotland to be lit by the Commissioners of Northern Lights. Kinnaird Castle and the nearby Winetower were described by W. Douglas Simpson as two of the nine castles of the Knuckle, referring to the rocky headland of north-east Aberdeenshire. The lighthouse is a category A listed building. and the Winetower is a scheduled monument.\n\nKinnaird Castle, also known as Fraserburgh Castle and Kinnairdshead Castle, was begun in March 1570. The builder was Sir Alexander Fraser, 8th laird of Philorth, (c.1536–1623), who also transformed the fishing village of Faithlie into the burgh of Fraserburgh in the 1590s. However, the building of the castle led to such expense that he was forced to sell Philorth Castle, the family home. Alexander, 10th of Philorth, fought for the king at the Battle of Worcester (1651). Despite being badly wounded, he survived to live into his eighties. In 1669 he inherited the title of Lord Saltoun, and in later years he had apartments at Kinnaird Castle The last people to reside in the castle were Henrietta Fraser (1698-1751), daughter of the 12th Lord Saltoun, and her husband John Gordon of Kinellar (1684-1764). In 1787 it was leased to the Trustees of the Northern lights, who turned it into Kinnaird Head Lighthouse. Designed by Thomas Smith, the lamp was first lit on 1 December. The structure was rebuilt in the 1820s, and superseded by a new lighthouse in 1991. It now houses the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses, which incorporates the original lighthouse and a modern building housing collections of lenses and other artefacts from many lighthouses across Scotland.\n\nThe Winetower is a small three-storey tower located approximately from Kinnaird Head Lighthouse. The tower has been dated to the 16th-century, and may have gained its name through use as a store associated with the castle. The tower is accessed via the second floor, and contains elaborate carved stone pendants. It is reputed that in the cave below, one of the Fraser family imprisoned his daughter's boyfriend, leaving him to drown there. The daughter then jumped from the roof of the tower. There is red paint on the rocks below to illustrate her blood. According to local tradition, the tower is said to be haunted.\n\n"}

It is well-regarded by critics, and has been often cited as one of the best games for the NES.\n\nThe play and mechanics of \"Ice Hockey\" are mostly similar to that of ice hockey in real life. The objective for both team is to hit a black puck with a hockey stick that each player carries into the opponent's goal. Teams are made up of five players including the goaltender, as opposed to six in real life. Players wear ice skates, which are used to skate across the icy arena. Each game is made up of three periods, with the victory going to the team who has the most points at the end of the game. At the beginning, two opposing players from each team face off in the middle of the rink. There are three kinds of players - the first is fast, weak, and feeble, but is good at the face-off; the second is average in all qualities, and the third is slow and poor at the face-off, but very powerful, both in body checking and shooting strength. The arena is similarly designed to a real-world ice hockey arena. The arena is coated in ice, with a goal on either side of the arena. There are a variety of marked areas, including the goal line that the puck must cross to score, the attacking/defending zone which is situated closely to each goal, the face-off spot, the neutral spot, and others. Each side of the arena has exactly the same design. If two opposing players fight for the puck for a certain amount of time, other players join into the fight, resulting in the player from the losing team in the fight to be put in the penalty box for a period of time.\n\nThere are some regional differences in the team roster line-ups.

He was Prime Minister of Spain in 1868–69 and regent in 1869–70.\n\nSerrano was born on 17 December 1810 in the Isla de León (current day San Fernando), in the Bay of Cádiz. He was son of Francisco Serrano y Cuenca and Isabel Domínguez de Guevara Vasconcelos. His father, born in Lopera, parish of Purísima Concepción, was a general officer and a Liberal. His mother was born in Marbella circa 1780.\n\nSerrano began his studies at Vergara in the Basque provinces.\n\nFollowing his father into the military, he became a cadet in 1822 in the Sagunto regiment, cornet in 1833 in the lancers of Sagunto, and passed into the carabiniers in 1829. When the Carlist agitation began in 1833, he transferred into the cuirassiers. He formed part of the escort that accompanied Don Carlos, the first pretender and brother of Ferdinand VII, to the frontier of Portugal.\n\nAs \"aide-de-camp\" of Espoz y Mina, then under the orders of generals Córdoba and Espartero, in the armies of Queen Isabella, Serrano took such an active part in the First Carlist War from 1834 to 1839, that he rose from the rank of captain to that of brigadier-general. He was awarded the Cross of San Fernando and many medals. He was also granted the 155th Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword.\n\nIn 1839, he was elected as a member of Cortes for the first time for Málaga. In 1840 he was promoted to the rank of general of division and commander of the district of Valencia, which he relinquished to take his seat in congress.\n\nFrom that day Serrano became one of the chief military politicians of Spain. In 1841, he helped Espartero to overthrow the regency of Maria Christina of Bourbon-Sicily. In 1843, at Barcelona he made a \"pronunciamiento\" against Espartero. He was appointed as the minister of war in the cabinet of Joaquín María López y López, which convoked the Cortes that declared Queen Isabella of age at fifteen. He served in the same capacity in an Olozaga cabinet, sulked as long as the Moderates (\") were in office.\n\nIn 1845, he was appointed as a senator, and in 1848 as captain-general of Granada. From 1846 to 1853, he was away from politics, living on his Andalusian estates or traveling abroad. \n\nOn 29 September 1850 in Madrid, Serrano married his first cousin, Antonia Domínguez y Borrell, Guevara y Lemus, 2nd Countess of San Antonio, with whom he had five children.\n\nSerrano assisted Marshal Leopoldo O'Donnell in the military movements of 1854 and 1856, and was his staunch follower for twelve years.\n\nO'Donnell appointed Serrano as marshal in 1856 and captain-general of Cuba from 1859 to 1862. Serrano governed that island with success, and helped carry out the war in Santo Domingo. He was the first viceroy to advocate political and financial reforms in the colony.\n\nOn his return to Peninsular Spain, O'Donnell made him Duke of la Torre (\"), Grandee of Spain of the first class, and the 139th Minister of Foreign Affairs, serving from 18 January to 2 March 1863.\nSerrano risked his life in helping O'Donnell quell the insurrection of 22 June 1866 at Madrid. He was awarded with the Order of the Golden Fleece.\n\nAfter the death of O'Donnell, Serrano became the leader of the Liberal Union Party. As president of the senate, he assisted Ríos Rosas to draw up a petition to Queen Isabella against her Moderate ministers, for which both were exiled. \n\nSerrano began to conspire with Antoine, Duke of Montpensier, Prim and Sagasta. On 7 July 1868, González Bravo had Serrano and other generals arrested and taken to the Canary Islands. There Serrano remained until Admiral Topete sent a steamer to bring him to Cadiz on 18 September that same year.\n\nOn landing he signed the manifesto of the revolution with Prim, Topete, Sagasta, Martos and others, and accepted the command of the revolutionary army. He routed the troops of Queen Isabella under the orders of the Marquess of Novaliches at the bridge of Alcolea. The queen fled to France, and Serrano, having entered Madrid, formed a Provisional Government.\n\nIn February 1869, he convoked the Cortes Constituyentes; he was appointed successively as president of the executive, Prime Minister of Spain, and Regent from 3 October 1868 to 18 June 1869. Serrano ruled impartially, respecting the independence of the Cortes and cabinets. He acceded to their selection of Amadeus I of Savoy as king, although he would have preferred Montpensier.\n\nAs soon as Amadeus reached Madrid, after the death of Prim, Serrano consented to form a coalition cabinet, which lasted only a few months. Serrano resigned and took the command of the Italian king's army against the Carlists in northern Spain.\nHe tried to form one more cabinet under King Amadeus as the 65th Prime Minister of Spain on 6 June 1872, but resigned on 12 June when that monarch declined to give his ministers dictatorial powers and sent for Ruiz Zorrilla. His mistakes led to Amadeus abdicating the throne on 11 February 1873.\n\nSerrano opposed the federal republic, and conspired with other generals and politicians to overthrow it on 23 April 1873. Having failed, he went into exile in France. On the eve of his \"coup d'état\" of 3 January 1874 that sought to thwart the Federal Republic, the leading instigator, the General Pavía, sent for Serrano to take the leadership.\nSerrano again took the title of president of the executive; he tried to form a coalition cabinet, but Cristino Martos and Sagasta soon quarrelled. His next cabinet was presided over by Sagasta. The military and political unrest continued, and at the end of December 1874, the Bourbons were restored by another \"pronunciamiento.\"\n\nDuring the eleven months he remained in office, Serrano devoted his attention chiefly to the reorganization of finance, the renewal of relations with American and European powers, and the suppression of revolt. \n\nAfter Alfonso XII ascended the throne in 1875, Serrano spent some time in France. He returned to Madrid in 1876, attended palace receptions, took his seat as a marshal in the senate, and flirted politically with Sagasta and his party in 1881. He finally gave his support to the formation of a dynastic Left with a democratic program defended by his nephew, General López Domínguez.\n\nHe died in Madrid on 25 November/26 November 1885, twenty-four hours after Alfonso XII, son of Isabella II, and purportedly, her husband and cousin Francis, although Alfonso's true biological paternity is uncertain.\n"}
{"id": "2225215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2225215", "title": "Phytolith", "text": "Phytolith\n\nPhytoliths (from Greek, \"plant stone\") are rigid, microscopic structures made of silica, found in some plant tissues and persisting after the decay of the plant. These plants take up silica from the soil, whereupon it is deposited within different intracellular and extracellular structures of the plant. Phytoliths come in varying shapes and sizes. Although some use \"phytolith\" to refer to all mineral secretions by plants, it more commonly refers to siliceous plant remains. In contrast, mineralized calcium secretions in cacti are composed of calcium oxalates. \n\nThe silica is absorbed in the form of monosilicic acid (Si(OH)₄), and is carried by the plant’s vascular system to the cell walls, cell lumen, and intercellular spaces. Depending on the plant taxa and soil condition, absorbed silica can range from 0.1% to 10% of the plant’s total dry weight. When deposited, the silica replicates the structure of the cells, providing structural support to the plant. Phytoliths strengthen the plant against abiotic stressors such as salt runoff, metal toxicity, and extreme temperatures. Phytoliths can also protect the plant against biotic threats such as insects and fungal diseases.\n\nThere is still debate in the scientific community as to why plants form phytoliths, and whether silica should be considered an essential nutrient for plants. Studies that have grown plants in silica-free environments have typically found that plants lacking silica in the environment do not grow well. For example, the stems of certain plants will collapse when grown in soil lacking silica. In many cases, phytoliths appear to lend structure and support to the plant, much like the spicules in sponges and leather corals. Phytoliths may also provide plants with protection. These rigid silica structures help to make plants more difficult to consume and digest, lending the plant's tissues a grainy or prickly texture. Phytoliths also appear to provide physiologic benefits. Experimental studies have shown that the silicon dioxide in phytoliths may help to alleviate the damaging effects of toxic heavy metals, such as aluminum.\nFinally, calcium oxalates serve as a reserve of carbon dioxide. Cacti use these as a reserve for photosynthesis during the day when they close their pores to avoid water loss; baobabs use this property to make their trunks more flame-resistant.\n\nAccording to Dolores Piperno, an expert in the field of phytolith analysis, there have been four important stages of phytolith research throughout history.\n\nSoluble silica, also called monosilicic acid with a chemical formula of (Si(OH)4), is taken up from the soil when plant roots absorb groundwater. From there, it is carried to other plant organs by the xylem. By an unknown mechanism, which appears to be linked to genetics and metabolism, some of the silica is then laid down in the plant as silicon dioxide. This biological mechanism does not appear to be limited to specific plant structures, as some plants have been found with silica in their reproductive and sub-surface organs.\n\nPhytoliths are composed mainly of noncrystalline silicon dioxide, and about 4% to 9% of their mass is water. Carbon, nitrogen, and other major nutrient elements comprise less than 5%, and commonly less than 1%, of phytolith material by mass. These elements are present in the living cells in which the silica concretions form, so traces are retained in the phytoliths. Such immobilised elements, in particular carbon, are valuable in that they permit radiometric dating in reconstructing past vegetation patterns.\nThe silica in phytoliths has a refractive index ranging from 1.41 to 1.47, and a specific gravity from 1.5 to 2.3. Phytoliths may be colorless, light brown, or opaque; most are transparent. Phytoliths exist in various three-dimensional shapes, some of which are specific to plant families, genera or species.\n\nPhytoliths may form within single cells, or multiple cells within a plant to form 'conjoined' or multi-cell phytoliths, which are three-dimensional replicas of sections of plant tissue. Conjoined phytoliths occur when conditions are particularly favourable for phytolith formation, such as on a silica rich substrate with high water availability\n\nSilica is not considered an essential nutrient for plants such as nitrogen or phosphorus. However, silica-aided phytoliths can help a plant be more resilient against biotic and abiotic stressors. Silica is bioactive, meaning it is able to change the expression of certain plant genes to jumpstart a defensive response against these stressors. In terms of fungal infections, the deposition of silica has been shown to create a physical barrier between invading fungi and the plant. Some factors however can have very damaging effects on the plant and limit or alter phytolith production. \n\nIn 2009, researchers at the Rock Springs Agricultural Experiment Station at The Pennsylvania State University investigated the effects of pathogenic viruses on phytolith production in \"Cucurbita pepo\" var. Texana. The plants that were affected by either mosaic virus (carried by aphids) or bacterial wilt disease (carried by cucumber beetles) were infected on their own to replicate natural conditions and all plants were grouped into three categories: healthy plants sprayed to prevent insect herbivory, plants infected with mosaic disease, and plants infected with bacterial wilt disease.\n\nAnalysis after harvest yielded 1,072 phytoliths from forty-five plants. Plants affected by mosaic disease experienced a decrease in phytolith size. This is because the virus constricts overall plant growth and therefore phytolith growth as well. Contrastingly, plants affected with bacterial wilt disease resulted in much larger phytoliths but they were abnormally shaped. This could be due to the virus causing constriction of the hypodermal cells, causing an influx of silica deposits.\n\nBecause identification of phytoliths is based on morphology, it is important to note taxonomical differences in phytolith production.\n\nFamilies with high phytolith production; family and genus-specific phytolith morphology is common:\n\nFamilies where phytolith production may not be high; family and genus-specific phytolith morphology is common:\n\nFamilies where phytolith production is common; family and genus-specific phytolith morphology is uncommon:\n\nFamilies where phytolith productions varies; family and genus-specific phytolith morphology is uncommon:\n\nFamilies where phytolith production is rare or not observed:\n\nPhytoliths are very robust, and are useful in archaeology because they can help to reconstruct the plants present at a site when the rest of the plant parts have been burned up or dissolved. Because they are made of the inorganic substances silica or calcium oxalate, phytoliths don't decay with the rest of the plant and can survive in conditions that would destroy organic residues. Phytoliths can provide evidence of both economically important plants and those that are indicative of the environment at a particular time period.\n\nPhytoliths may be extracted from residue on many sources: dental calculus (buildup on teeth); food preparation tools like rocks, grinders, and scrapers; cooking or storage containers; ritual offerings; and garden areas.\n\n\nThe first step in extracting phytoliths from the soil matrix involves removing all non-soil and non-sediment material. This can include stone or bone tools, teeth, or other various prehistoric artifacts. Clay has a strong ability for holding onto phytoliths and also must be removed using a centrifuge technique. Once the sample is left to only house soil and sediment components, phytoliths can be separated through a variety of techniques. Pressurized microwave extraction is a fast method but does not produce as pure of results as other methods. Dry ashing tends to break up phytoliths better than wet ashing. Ethanol can also be added to the sample and lit on fire, leaving only the phytoliths behind\nOne of the most effective methods of phytolith isolation is heavy liquid flotation. Over time, different liquids have been utilized as technology changes, each still carrying different advantages and disadvantages to the separation process. Current liquids used include zinc bromide, hydrochloric acid, or sodium polytungstate which are added to the sample. After flotation occurs, the separated phytoliths and liquid are moved to another container where water is added. This lowers the solution’s density, causing the phytoliths to sink to the bottom of the container. The phytoliths are removed and rinsed several times to ensure all of the flotation solvent has been removed and they are placed in storage. Phytoliths can either be stored in a dry setting or in ethanol to prevent abrasion.\n\nWhen examining the sample, polarized light microscopy, simple light microscopy, phase contrast microscopy, or scanning electron microscopy can be used. The sample should be placed in a mounting media on the slide which can be Canada Balsam, Benzyl Benzoate, silicon oil, glycerin, or water. The target phytolith count is dependent on the objectives, research design, and conditions of the archaeological site from which they were obtained. However, a count of two hundred phytoliths are recommended as a good starting point. If the conditions warrant, more should be counted. It is still not possible to isolate plant DNA from extracted phytoliths. \n\nBurned Phytoliths:\nWhen looking at a phytolith through a microscope lens, it will usually appear clear against the microscope’s light. However phytoliths dark in color are found in the archeological record; these phytoliths display evidence of fire exposure. Gradation of darkness can be used to calculate past environmental fires. Darker phytoliths are correlated with higher carbon residue and fires with higher temperatures which can be measured on the Burnt Phytolith Index (BPI). Burned phytoliths can also appear melted in addition to darkened color.\n\nFires which cause burned phytoliths can be ignited by anthropogenic or non-anthropogenic sources and can be determined through charcoal and burned phytolith analysis. It is believed that during prehistoric times, an increase in intensive land use such as through agriculture, caused an increase in anthropogenic fires while non-anthropogenic fires could have resulted from lightning strikes. Fire intensity depends on available biomass which usually peaks in the dry, fall season.\n\n\n\nTaxonomic resolution issues deriving from the multiplicity and redundancy problems can be dealt with by integrating phytolith analysis with other areas, such as micromorphology and morphometric approaches used in soil analysis.\nIt is suggested that using phytolith data from food residues (on ceramics, usually) can decrease the bias from both of these problems, because phytolith analysis is more likely to represent crop products and identification of phytoliths can be made with more confidence. Also, food residues do not usually accumulate extraneous deposits. In other words, the samples are more likely to represent a primary context.\n\nPhytoliths occur abundantly in the fossil record, and have been reported from the Late Devonian onwards. Robustness of phytoliths make them available to be found in various remains including sedimentary deposits, coprolites, and dental calculus from diverse environmental conditions. In addition to reconstructing human-plant interactions since the Pleistocene, phytoliths can be used to identify palaeoenvironments and to track vegetational change. More and more studies are acknowledging phytolith records as a valuable tool for reconstructing pre-Quaternary vegetation changes (e.g.,). Occasionally, paleontologists find and identify phytoliths associated with extinct plant-eating animals (i.e. herbivores). Findings such as these reveal useful information about the diet of these extinct animals, and also shed light on the evolutionary history of many different types of plants. Paleontologists in India have recently identified grass phytoliths in dinosaur dung (coprolites), strongly suggesting that the evolution of grasses began earlier than previously thought.\n\nPhytolith records in the context of the global silica cycle, along with CO concentrations and other paleoclimatological records, can help constrain estimates of certain long-term terrestrial, biogeochemical cycles and interrelated climate changes.\n\nLight intensity (e.g., open versus closed canopies) can affect cell morphology, especially cell length and area, which can be measured from phytolith fossils. These can be useful for tracing fluctuations in the ancient light regime and canopy cover.\n\nFreshwater oases and related landscape changes that could have affected plant-human interactions were reconstructed through synthesizing phytolith, pollen, and paleoenvironmental data in the well-known early hominin site of Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania.\n\nComparisons between paleorecords of phytolith remains and modern reference remains in the same region can aid reconstructing how plant composition and related environments changed over time.\n\nThough further testing is required, evolution and development of phytoliths in vascular plants seem to be related to certain types of plant-animal interactions in which phytoliths function as a defensive mechanism for herbivores or related to adaptive changes to habitats.\nJapanese and Korean archaeologists refer to grass and crop plant phytoliths as \"plant opal\" in archaeological literature.\n\nFor extended examples of phytolith taxonomy, see the University of Sheffield's comprehensive Phytolith Interpretation page.\n\nResearch, particularly since 2005 has shown that carbon in phytoliths can be resistant to decomposition for millennia and can accumulate in soils. While researchers had previously known that phytoliths could persist in some soils for thousands of years and that there was carbon occluded within phytoliths that could be used for radiocarbon dating, research into the capacity of phytoliths as a method of storing carbon in soils was pioneered by Parr and Sullivan suggested that there was a real opportunity to sequester carbon securely in soils for the long term, in the form of carbon inclusions in durable silica phytoliths.\n\nDuring the mineralization process which creates the phytolith, many different nutrients are absorbed from the soil including carbon which forms \"Phytolith Occluded Carbon\" (PhytOC). Phytoliths are able to hold PhytOC in the soil for thousands of years, much longer than other organic methods. While this yields phytoliths as an important area of study regarding carbon sequestration, not all plant species produce analogous results. For example, phytoliths derived from oats can hold 5.0% to 5.8% carbon while sugarcane phytoliths can yield 3.88% to 19.26% carbon. Different species and subspecies hold different carbon storage potential within the silica rather than within the plant itself. Therefore, total PhytOC sequester largely depends on the condition of the biome such as grassland, forest, or cropland, and is influenced by climate and soil conditions. Proper upkeep of these ecosystems can boost biomass production and therefore more silica and carbon uptake. Proper conservation methods could include controlled grazing or fires.\n\nWhile carbon sequestration is a potentially important way to limit atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations in the long term, the use of phytoliths to achieve this must be balanced against other uses that might be made of the same biomass carbon (or land for producing biomass) to reduce GHG emissions by other means including, for example, the production of bioenergy to offset fossil fuel emissions. If enhanced phytolith production results in a reduced availability of biomass for other GHG mitigation strategies, its effectiveness for lowering net GHG emissions may be reduced or negated.\n\n\n\n"}

He has been criticized by scientists, historians, biblical scholars, as well as some creationists.\n\nWyatt was working as a nurse anesthetist in a hospital in Madison, Tennessee, when in 1960, he saw a picture in \"Life\" of the Durupınar site, a boat-like shape on a mountain near Mount Ararat. The resulting widespread speculation in evangelical Christian circles that this might be Noah's Ark started Wyatt on his career as an amateur archaeologist. From 1977 until his death in 1999 he made over one hundred trips to the Middle East, his interests widening to take in a wide variety of references from the Old and New Testaments.\n\nBy the time of his death in 1999, Wyatt claimed to have discovered several sites and artifacts related to the Bible and biblical archaeology. These included: \n\nWyatt was not considered credible by professional archaeologists and biblical scholars. The Garden Tomb Association of Jerusalem state in a letter they issue to visitors on request:\n\nThe Council of the Garden Tomb Association (London) totally refute the claim of Wyatt to have discovered the original Ark of the Covenant or any other biblical artifacts within the boundaries of the area known as the Garden Tomb Jerusalem. Though Wyatt was allowed to dig within this privately owned garden on a number of occasions (the last occasion being the summer of 1991) staff members of the Association observed his progress and entered his excavated shaft. As far as we are aware nothing was ever discovered to support his claims nor have we seen any evidence of biblical artifacts or temple treasures.\n\nArchaeologist Joe Zias of Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) has stated that \"Ron Wyatt is neither an archaeologist nor has he ever carried out a legally licensed excavation in Israel or Jerusalem. In order to excavate one must have at least a BA in archaeology which he does not possess despite his claims to the contrary. ... [His claims] fall into the category of trash which one finds in tabloids such as the \"National Enquirer\", \"Sun\" etc.\"\n\nWyatt's official organization, Wyatt Archaeological Research (WAR), claims that the IAA have always been aware of the excavations and issued \"verbal permits\" for most of them and official permits to all WAR excavations since 2002. Nevertheless, the only evidence of WAR involvement in a legitimate excavation sanctioned by the IAA relates to WAR part-funding of a 2005 dig.\n\nEvangelicals have also been critical of Wyatt's claims: Answers in Genesis called Wyatt's claims \"fraudulent\", and David Merling, a Seventh-day Adventist professor of archaeology addressed the issues of Wyatt's Noah's Ark and anchor stones with the following: \n\nWhile the Durupinar site is about the right length for Noah's ark, [it is] ... too wide to be Noah's ark. Wyatt has claimed that the \"boat-shapedness\" of this formation can only be explained by its being Noah's ark, but both Shea and Morris have offered other plausible explanations. Likewise, Wyatt has argued that the standing stones he has found are anchors, while Terian is aware of similar stones outside the Durupinar site area that were pagan cultic stones later converted by Christians for Christian purposes.\n\nWyatt died on August 4, 1999, aged 66, in Baptist Central Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, following cancer. His interment was in Columbia's Polk Memorial Park Cemetery.\n\nFollowing Wyatt's death, a split developed between the official Wyatt Archaeological Research (WAR) organization, which he founded, and the independent ministries and interested individuals that had previously cooperated with WAR. WAR claims to be the sole owner of all Wyatt's photographs, newsletters and other intellectual property. Other individuals who had known and worked with Wyatt established independent ministries and websites with the purpose of promoting Wyatt's discoveries outside the framework set by WAR.\n\n\n"}

Her work is sometimes classified as minimalist art. Rainer currently lives and works in New York.\n\nYvonne Rainer was born on November 24, 1934, in San Francisco, California. Rainer's parents, Joseph and Jeanette, considered themselves radicals. Her mother, a stenographer, was born in Brooklyn to Jewish immigrants from Warsaw, and her father, a stonemason and house painter, was born in Vallanzengo, northern Italy, whence he emigrated at the age of 21. Rainer grew up, along with an older brother, in the Sunset district of San Francisco that she describes as \"a neighborhood of white Protestant working class families.\" From the age of twelve, she was \"exposed to the heady commingling of poets, painters, writers, and Italian anarchists.\" Throughout her childhood her father took her to foreign films at the Palace of the Legion of Honor, while her mother took her to the ballet and opera. She attended Lowell High School, and after graduation she enrolled in San Francisco Junior College and dropped out after a year.\n\nIn her late teens, while earning her living as a clerk-typist at an insurance company, Rainer found herself hanging out at the Cellar, a jazz club in North Beach in San Francisco, where she would listen to poets accompanied by live cool jazz musicians.

At her first class Stephen told her that she was not very \"turned out.\" Rainer admits, \"What she didn't say was something that I would gradually recognize in the next couple of years, that my lack of turn-out and limberness coupled with a long back and short legs would reduce my chances of performing with any established dance company.\" Beginning in 1959, she studied for a year at the Martha Graham School, where Graham notoriously told her, \"When you accept yourself as a woman, you will have turn-out\"; later she took ballet classes with Mia Slavenska followed by classes with James Waring, in whose company she danced briefly, and for eight years she studied with Merce Cunningham.\n\nIn the year in which Rainer studied at the Graham School – 1959-60 – Rainer met Simone Forti and Nancy Meehan, who had worked with Anna Halprin and Welland Lathrop in San Francisco. In early summer of 1960 the three of them rented a New York studio and worked on movement improvisations. In August of that year Rainer traveled with Forti to Marin County, CA to take Halprin's summer workshop, which was very important, in addition to Forti's influence, to Rainer's early solo dance work.\n\nIn the fall of 1960 both Forti and Rainer attended the choreography workshop that musician-composer Robert Dunn began to conduct in the Cunningham studio based on the theories of John Cage. The other members of this course were Steve Paxton, Ruth Emerson, Paulus Berenson, and Marni Mahaffey. It was here that Rainer created and performed her earliest dances.\n\nIn 1962, at the age of 27, Rainer, Steve Paxton, and Ruth Emerson approached the Reverend Al Carmines at the Judson Memorial Church to ask if they could begin performing there. The Church was already known for the Judson Poets' Theater and Judson Art Gallery, which had been showing the work of Claes Oldenburg, Allan Kaprow, Robert Whitman, Jim Dine, and Tom Wesselmann. It now became a focal point for vanguard dance activity and concerts of dance.\n\nRainer is noted for an approach to dance that treats the body more as the source of an infinite variety of movements than as the purveyor of plot or drama. Many of the elements she employed—such as repetition, tasks, and indeterminacy—later became standard features of contemporary dance. In 1965, when writing about a recent dance — \"Parts of Some Sextets\" — for the Tulane Drama Review, she ended the essay with what became her notorious \"No Manifesto\", which she \"reconsidered\" in 2008.\n\nIn her early dances, Rainer focused on sounds and movements and often juxtaposed the two in arbitrary combinations. Inspired by the chance procedures favored by Cage and Cunningham, Rainer's choreography was a combination of classical dance steps contrasted with pedestrian movement. She used a great deal of repetition and employed spoken language and oral noises (including squeaks, and shrieks, etc.) within the body of her dances.\n\nRepetition and sound were employed in her first choreographed piece, \"Three Satie Spoons\" (1961), a solo in three parts performed by Rainer to the accompaniment of Eric Satie's \"Trois Gymnopedies\". The last section contained a repeated \"beep beep beep in a falsetto squeak and the spoken line: \"The grass is greener when the sun is yellower.\" Over time her work shifted to include more narrative and cohesive spoken words. \"Ordinary Dance\" (1962) was a combination of movement and narrative, and featured the repetition of simple movements while Rainer recited an autobiographical monologue containing the names of the streets on which she had lived while in San Francisco. One characteristic of Rainer's early choreography was her fascination with using untrained performers. \"We Shall Run\" (1963) had twelve performers, both dancers and non-dancers who, clad in street clothes, ran around the stage in various floor patterns for twelve minutes to the \"Tuba Mirum\" from Berlioz's \"Requiem.\" Her first evening length choreography, for six dancers, called \"Terrain\", was performed at Judson Church in 1963.\n\nOne of Rainer's most famous pieces, \"Trio A\" (1966), was initially the first section of an evening-long work entitled \"The Mind Is a Muscle\". Her decision in \"\"Trio A\"\" to execute movements with an even distribution of energy reflected a challenge to traditional attitudes to \"phrasing,\" which can be defined as the way in which energy is distributed in the execution of a movement or series of movements. The innovation of \"Trio A\" lies in its attempt to erase the differences of energy investment within both a given phrase and the transition from one to another, resulting in an absence of the classical appearance of \"attack\" at the beginning of a phrase, recovery at the end, with energy arrested somewhere in the middle, as in a \"grand jeté\". Another characteristic of this five-minute dance is that the performer never makes eye contact with the spectators, and in the instance in which the movement requires the dancer to face the audience, the eyes are closed or the head is involved in movement. Although Rainer used repetition in earlier works as a device to make movement easier to read, she decided to not repeat any movements in the piece. \"Trio A\" is often referred to as a task-oriented performance due to this style of energy distribution, also for its emphasis on a neutral, or characterless, approach to movement execution and a lack of interaction with the audience. The first time the piece was performed it was entitled \"The Mind is a Muscle, Part 1\", and was performed simultaneous, but not in unison, by Rainer, Steve Paxton, and David Gordon. \"Trio A\" has been widely taught and performed by other dancers.\n\nRainer has choreographed more than 40 concert works.\n\n\nRainer sometimes included filmed sequences in her dances, and in 1972 she began to turn her attention to directing feature-length films. The feminist tone of her films, characterized by an interest in how the female body was being viewed or objectified by male directors, would have resonated with emerging feminist film theory of the time period, in seminal texts like Laura Mulvey's Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema becoming very influential. Her early films do not follow narrative conventions; instead, Rainer's films combine autobiography and fiction, sound and intertitles, to address social and political issues. Rainer directed several experimental films about dance and performance, including \"Lives of Performers\" (1972), \"Film About a Woman Who\" (1974), and \"Kristina Talking Pictures\" (1976). Her later films include \"Journeys from Berlin/1971\" (1980), \"The Man Who Envied Women\" (1985), \"Privilege\" (1990), and \"MURDER and murder\" (1996). \"MURDER and murder\", more conventional in its narrative structure, is a lesbian love story dealing with Rainer's own experience of breast cancer.\n\nIn 2000 Rainer returned to dance and choreography to create \"After Many a Summer Dies the Swan\", for Mikhail Baryshnikov's White Oak Dance Project. In 2006, Rainer choreographed a work entitled \"AG Indexical, with a Little Help from H.M.\", which was a reinterpretation George Balanchine's \"Agon\" Rainer continued to choreograph works based on classical pieces, including \"RoS Indexical\" (2007), inspired by Vaslav Nijinsky's \"The\" \"Rite of Spring\". This work was commissioned for the Performa 07 biennial organized by performance art organization Performa, which has managed Rainer since then.\n\nSubsequent works include Spiraling Down (2010), \"Assisted Living: Good Sports 2\" (2010) and \"Assisted Living: Do You Have Any Money?\" (2013), two pieces in which Rainer explores the theatrical and historic motif of tableau vivants among political, philosophical and economic readings.\n\nAn exhibition at London's Raven Row Gallery was the first to feature live performances of her 1960's dances during an exhibition of photos and scores from her entire career, in addition to film screenings.\n\nIn 2015, she choreographed and presented \"The Concept of Dust, or How do you look when there's nothing left to move?\" (2015), commissioned by Performa and The Getty Research Institute, a performance containing choreographed work interspersed with a wide range of political, historical, and journalistic texts read intermittently by the dancers and Rainer herself. This work was presented at The Museum of Modern Art, and later toured European venues including La Fondazione Antonio Ratti in Como, Italy, Marseille Objectif Danse in France, and the Louvre. A latter version of this same dance, called \"The Concept of Dust: Continuous Project-Altered Annually\" was performed in 2016 at The Kitchen in New York, and in Marseilles, Porto, and Barcelona in 2017.\n\nReading feminist writing and theory allowed Rainer to examine her own experience as a woman, and she was able to think of herself as a participant in culture and society. Little did Rainer realize that her prior choreography was a direct challenge of the \"traditional\" dance and ultimately feminist in nature. Throughout the 1980s, Rainer was celibate, and she was determined \"not to enter into any more ill-fated heterosexual adventures ...\" She began attending Gay Pride Parades and considered herself a \"political lesbian.\" Rainer participated in a demonstration in New York and Washington D.C. to protest the challenges to \"Roe v. Wade\" during this same time period. At the age of 56, she overcame her fears of identifying as a lesbian by becoming intimate with Martha Gever. They are still together today.\n\nFeminist Audre Lorde's famous statement posed, \"You can't dismantle the master's house using the master's tools.\" Rainer rebutted her theory by stating, \"You can, if you expose the tools.\"\n\nRainer was interviewed for the feminist film \"!Women Art Revolution\". \n\nRainer is referenced in several places as example of artist, feminist, and lesbian in the second edition of \"Feminism Art Theory\" edited by Hilary Robinson. For further reading, see chapter 6.2 Lesbian and Queer Practices. p. 398-434.\n\nIn 1990, Rainer was awarded with a MacArthur Fellows Program award (or \"Genius Grant\") for her contributions to dance. In 2015 she received the Foundation for Contemporary Arts's Merce Cunningham Award; in 2017 she received a USA Grant. She has also received two Guggenheim Fellowships (1969,1988).\n\n\n\n"}

Tourism is popular in this rural area which is an agricultural region with a emphasis on wine grapes. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Los Olivos as a census-designated place (CDP). The population was 1,132 at the 2010 census. The ZIP Code is 93441, and the community is within the area code 805.\n\nSometime around 1880, on a bluff overlooking Alamo Pintado Creek, just north of the town of Ballard, a two-story house was built, with a wide, covered front porch and neatly symmetrical arched windows in the center gable, situated on prime farmland. It became the property of twenty-two-year-old Alden March Boyd, of Albany, New York, when he paid $8,000 for \"157 acres, more or less, together with the dwelling house,\" in 1885. He planted five thousand olive trees, and called it Rancho De Los Olivos. The 1880s were a boom time for California. On November 16, 1887, the Pacific Coast Railway line extension from Los Alamos was completed. The developers of the narrow-gauge railway first named their town El Olivar, then El Olivos, and finally Los Olivos, after Boyd's nearby ranch.\n\nLos Olivos was connected by the narrow gauge railroad to points north as far as San Luis Obispo until the train made its last run in 1934. The southern terminus of the railroad was in front of Mattei's Tavern, where a stagecoach line continued over San Marcos Pass into Santa Barbara.\n\nLos Olivos is one of five communities (with Ballard, Buellton, Solvang, and Santa Ynez) that make up the Santa Ynez Valley. The census definition of the area was created by the Census Bureau for statistical purposes and may not precisely correspond to local understanding of the area with the same name. The town is near SR 154, a scenic road from Santa Barbara over San Marcos Pass, through the coastal Santa Ynez Mountains.\n\nUnder the Köppen Climate Classification, \"dry-summer subtropical\" climates are often referred to as \"Mediterranean\". Los Olivos has a mean yearly temperature of 61.6 °F (16.4 °C). The average high temperature in the summer months is 92 °F (33.3 °C), while the average low temperature in the winter months is 39.5 °F (4.2 °C). Summers are dry with little to no rain falling from June through September. Winters are mild and wet with the majority of the yearly precipitation (nearly 80%) falling from December through March.\n\nLos Olivos is known for its wineries and tasting rooms. Starting in Los Olivos and stretching north is the Foxen Canyon Wine Trail.\n\nThere are a number of large thoroughbred horse ranches in the area. Mattei's Tavern, a former stagecoach stop, is a restaurant.\n\nIn May 1986, Los Olivos was used as the location setting for the fictional town of \"Mayberry\" in the made-for-TV movie \"Return to Mayberry\", based on the popular 1960s sitcom \"The Andy Griffith Show\". Several locations in Los Olivos were featured in the 2004 movie \"Sideways\". The Los Olivos Grand Hotel, built in 1985, is now Fess Parker's Wine Country Inn, owned by the family of former \"Daniel Boone\" and \"Davy Crockett\" star, Fess Parker (1924-2010). Parker and his wine were featured on the NBC daytime drama, \"Santa Barbara\" ( first episode of Season Two ) of James May and Oz Clarke's Big Wine Adventure. \n\nPortions of the 1983 video for the song \"Say Say Say\", with Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney, were filmed at Sycamore Ranch, five miles from the town. According to La Toya Jackson, the McCartneys were staying at Sycamore Ranch during the filming. At the time, Jackson expressed interest in someday buying the property. In 1988, he would do so, renaming it Neverland Ranch. In early 2018, the property was for sale at $67 million. Episodes of The Bachelor were filmed in Los Olivos.\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Los Olivos had a population of 1,132. The population density was 460.3 people per square mile (177.7/km²). The racial makeup of Los Olivos was 1,049 (92.7%) White, 1 (0.1%) African American, 4 (0.4%) Native American, 12 (1.1%) Asian, 5 (0.4%) Pacific Islander, 40 (3.5%) from other races, and 21 (1.9%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 125 persons (11.0%).\n\nThe Census reported that 1,132 people (100% of the population) lived in households, 0 (0%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 0 (0%) were institutionalized.\n\nThere were 460 households, out of which 141 (30.7%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 276 (60.0%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 36 (7.8%) had a female householder with no husband present, 15 (3.3%) had a male householder with no wife present.

{"id": "2225265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2225265", "title": "Sydney Olympic FC", "text": "Sydney Olympic FC\n\nSydney Olympic Football Club is an Australian semi-professional soccer club, based in Belmore, Sydney, New South Wales, that plays in the National Premier Leagues NSW. The Club was founded as Pan-Hellenic Soccer Club in 1957 by Greek immigrants. In 1977, the Club changed its name to Sydney Olympic and became a founding member of the Phillips Soccer League, later named the National Soccer League (NSL), the inaugural national football league of Australia, remaining a member of the competition until its demise in 2004.\n\nSydney Olympic have won many trophies in Australian football, including two NSL Championships, two NSL Cups, the NSL Minor Premiership and three NSW Premier League Championships. The club has also won the Johnny Warren Cup, the Brett Emerton Cup, the National Youth League Championship, the National Youth League Minor Premiership and the NSW Premier League Club Championship.\n\nSydney Olympic has traditionally been one of the most well supported football teams in Australia, setting numerous domestic crowd attendances. A crowd of 18,985 attended Sydney Olympic's victory over Northern Spirit in 1998 at North Sydney Oval, a record crowd attendance between two clubs during the regular season of the NSL, defeating the previous record of 18,367 set when Newcastle KB United played Sydney Olympic in 1979 at Marathon Stadium. The greatest crowd attendance for a Grand Final was recorded during the 2001/02 season when 42,735 people were present at Subiaco Oval to see Sydney Olympic defeat Perth Glory.\n\nEstablished in Sydney by Greek immigrants in 1957, Sydney Olympic Football Club has been and continues to be a major pillar and a leading contributor to football in Australia as well as a nursery to many of its finest talents.\n\nIn the late 1940s and 50s there were several small Greek teams for the purposes of socialising and giving a sense of home for the newly arrived migrants. These teams included; Taxiarchis, Atlas, Astro, Pansamiakos as well as several others. Many people wondered about uniting all of these smaller teams to establish 1 strong Greek team in order to participate in the NSW Soccer Federation. The founding date of the Club is set as 28 November 1957, as this was the first meeting of Club Founder Christos Giannakoulias with several other influential protagonists at his home. It was decided there, that the newly formed team would be known as Pan-Hellenic, as it represented the shared journeys of Greeks from all over the world who migrated to Sydney and not just from Greece and Cyprus, but also from various other places like; Egypt, Romania, Albania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Anatolia and Asia Minor\n\nThe club was established as Pan Hellenic Soccer Club and its initial strip was blue and white vertical stripes.\n\nIn its first season in 1958, Pan-Hellenic found itself in the NSW 2nd Division, which at the time was split into 2 groups - Western & Eastern - After topping its group, Pan-Hellenic faced off with Budapest, who had topped the other group in the Grand Final, which Pan-Hellenic won 3-1. This still was not good enough for promotion and Pan-Hellenic was forced to play a separate play-off with Budapest for promotion. The initial match ended 1-1 and a replay was ordered a few days later, which Budapest won 4-0.\n\nFor season 1959, the Federation did away with a Finals Series and promotion playoffs, instead awarding promotion to the club which topped the competition table after the 26 rounds. Pan-Hellenic would miss out again on promotion, as it finished runner-up to Neerlandia.\n\nIn 1960 and in what would become a tradition in Australian Football, the format was changed yet again. A Finals Series would be played this season, Pan-Hellenic reached the Grand Final again, but would go on and lose to Polonia 2-1. But this time, the team which would end up atop the competition ladder was crowned the Champions and would be promoted, fortunately for Pan-Hellenic, they finished top of the ladder 1 point ahead of Polonia, were crowned Champions and finally earned promotion to the NSW 1st Division for 1961.\n\nIn its first season in the NSW 1st Division in 1961, the club would finish in the top 4 finishing 4th, a fantastic achievement. In the Finals Series Pan-Hellenic lost its Semi-Final to Hakoah 1-0.\n\n1962 saw Pan-Hellenic finish in 7th place, before rebounding in 1963 to once again make the top 4, finishing 4th once again and qualified for the Finals Series. South Coast United delivered a heavy blow in the Semi-Final, dishing out a 7-1 loss to Pan-Hellenic.\n\nIn 1964 Pan-Hellenic finished 6th. While in 1965 the club endured a difficult League campaign, coming within a whisker of being relegated, finishing 2nd last and having to endure the 3 relegation playoff ties. The first 2 ended in draws (0-0 and 1-1) against Polonia, the 3rd match was a 5-4 thriller to Pan-Hellenic, a victory which preserved its 1st Division status. This was in total contrast with Pan-Hellenic's Cup form, which saw them go on a run all the way to the Final, only to lose 3-1 to Hakoah.\n\nFor season 1966, Pan-Hellenic finished in 5th spot. The club would return to Finals Football once again in 1967 finishing in 4th, but would once again fail to progress in the Finals Series. 1967 also saw Pan-Hellenic go on a great run in the inaugural National Club Knock-Out competition the - Australia Cup - falling one game short of the Final, as it lost to APIA Leichhardt 3-2 after extra-time in the Semi-Final.\n\nThe 1968 season though, was the highlight of the pre-National Soccer League era, 11 years after the club's foundation, Pan-Hellenic finished 2nd in the standings and reached the NSW First Division Grand Final for the first time. Pan-Hellenic would unfortunately lose 4–2 to bitter rivals Hakoah in front of a crowd of 22,111 at the Sydney Sports Ground. In 1969 Pan-Hellenic would have to settle for a mid-table 6th-placed finish. The club also experienced another great Cup run making it to the Final once again in 1969, a Final it would ultimately lose 3-2 to Prague.\n\nAfter some lean seasons: \n1970 (8th), 1971 (10th), 1972 (7th), 1973 (9th)\n\n1974 saw a marked improvement in the team under Socceroos coach Rale Rasic. Pan-Hellenic just missed out on the top 4 to finish in 5th spot. 1975 did see Pan-Hellenic once again make the top 4, finishing in 3rd place. In the Finals Series Pan-Hellenic dispatched Auburn 2-1 in the Semi-Final to make it through to the Preliminary Final, which the club went on to lose 1–0 after extra-time to APIA Leichhardt, in a tight and tense affair.\n\nIn its final season in the NSW State League for the time being and its last season under the name Pan-Hellenic in 1976, the club just missed out on a Finals spot, ending up in 5th place.\n\nFor 1977 the club became a pioneering founding member of the National Soccer League, and also changed its name to Sydney Olympic.\n\nSydney Olympic had a tough initiation into National League Football in 1977, finishing 3rd last. 1978 saw a vast improvement from Sydney Olympic as it finished in a much-improved and respectable mid-table position.\n\nIn 1979 Sydney Olympic endured another difficult campaign, finishing in 2nd last place. The Federation at the time, then made the decision to \"cut back\" on teams from NSW and being the last placed NSW team, beating only South Melbourne who had finished last, Sydney Olympic was controversially relegated.\n\nThe spell back in the NSW First Division competition for the club did not last long, with Sydney Olympic defeating the Parramatta Eagles 4–0 in the 1980 NSW Grand Final to win the NSW First Division. That victory secured Sydney Olympic a return to top-flight Australian football in 1981 where it remained until the NSL folded in 2004.\n\nThe 1980s for Sydney Olympic were characterized with great football, large and passionate support, fantastic players, unfathomable highs as well as a litany of failures.\n\nSeasons 1981 and 1982 were a period of stabilisation for the club, as it settled back into the National Soccer League. Sydney Olympic finished both seasons in the safety of mid-table security. During this period many young players and future legends of the club would be given their opportunity to make their mark for Sydney Olympic.\n\nThe mid-1980s are generally referred to as a Golden Era for Sydney Olympic. It was exciting times and the club was on a high, huge crowds flocked and followed the club wherever they were playing, and on the park the team was playing magnificent football and in later years would be labelled as one of the best club sides in Australian football history.\n\nBetween 1983 and 1986 Sydney Olympic played in 4 consecutive National Finals. Beating Heidelberg United in the 1983 NSL Cup Final and beating Preston Lions in the 1985 NSL Cup Final. Sydney Olympic also made it to the NSL Grand Finals of 1984 and 1986, losing to South Melbourne FC and Adelaide City respectively.\n\nAfter this period, there was an exodus of players at Sydney Olympic meaning the team almost had to be re-built, as only a few players would remain. It showed as the club dropped back to a mid-table finish for season 1987.\n\nSydney Olympic bounced back in season 1988 to finish 5th and qualify for the Finals Series once again. Though disappointingly, they would go on to lose that Semi-Final 3-1 to the Marconi Stallions.\n\n1989 would prove to be a bitter-sweet end to the decade for Sydney Olympic. The club climbed the ladder and enjoyed a great season, finishing 3rd and once again qualifying for the Finals. A Semi-Final victory over Melbourne Knights was followed by a Preliminary Final victory over St George FC, meaning Sydney Olympic found themselves in their 3rd NSL Grand Final in 6 years. But it would not be 3rd time lucky for the Blues, as they succumbed to an injury-time winner in the Grand Final to lose 1-0 to Marconi in front of 23,387 fans at the Parramatta Stadium. 1989 also saw another great NSL Cup run for Sydney Olympic, reaching another Final. But the club could not make up for their Grand Final loss & lost the 1989 NSL Cup Final 2-0 to Adelaide City.\n\nThe 1990s began on the right foot for the club as it sneaked into that year's NSL Finals Series in 5th. A year after Sydney Olympic's 1989 NSL Grand Final loss against Marconi, 1990 saw Sydney Olympic meet Marconi once again in the Grand Final. This time it would be Olympic's day as they exacted revenge by beating Marconi 2–0, before a then record NSL crowd of 26,353. Scorers that day were Alistair Edwards and Robert Ironside either side of half-time. 1990 also saw Sydney Olympic reach another NSL Cup Final, their 4th in 8 years, unfortunately going down to South Melbourne.\n\nIn defense of their title in season 1990/91, Sydney Olympic endured an inconsistent season, which came down to the last match of the regular season in what became a pre-Finals Series playoff against 6th placed Parramatta Melita. Sitting in 5th, a draw would have been enough for Olympic to finish in the top 5 and qualify for the Finals, but a late Parramatta goal ensured Olympic would succumb to a 1–0 loss and were leapfrogged into the top 5 by Parramatta FC.\n\nSydney Olympic surged once again in season 1991/92, missing out on the Minor Premiership by 1 point. Things were looking promising heading into that season's Finals Series, but it was not to be as Olympic were disappointingly bundled out of the Finals.\n\nThe next few seasons were inconsistent for Olympic. 1992/93 (9th), 1993/94 (6th), 1994/95 (9th).\n\nFor season 1995/96, Sydney Olympic formed a prosperous partnership with the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) and became known as UTS Sydney Olympic. During that time, the Club's home ground was Leichhardt Oval, 1995/96 also saw Olympic finish 3rd on the ladder 1 point behind eventual Minor Premiers and old foes Marconi. Qualifying for the Finals Series again, Olympic were eventually eliminated by Adelaide City.\n\nA change of home ground awaited the Blues going into season 1996/97. Belmore Sports Ground, in the more traditional heartland of Olympic, became the Club's new home. In April 1997, Sydney Olympic enjoyed a record home attendance in the NSL at Belmore, of 16,724 against Marconi. Sydney Olympic missed out on Finals Football ending the season in 9th.\nSeason 1997/98 also saw the club's worst ever defeat in January 1998, when the Canberra Cosmos inflicted an 8–1 loss on Sydney Olympic in the nation's capital. This season saw Olympic finish 9th.\n\nDuring season 1998/99 Sydney Olympic was involved in a match which attracted the largest crowd for any regular NSL season match excluding finals. That game was against the Northern Spirit at North Sydney Oval in what was the Spirit's debut match in the NSL. That evening, 18,985 soccer-loving enthusiasts turned out to watch Sydney Olympic defeat new boys Northern Spirit 2–0. Olympic golden boys Chris Kalantzis and Pablo Cardozo were the goal scorers. The season saw Olympic finish 7th, missing the Finals\n\nThe 2000s saw Olympic's fortunes take an upturn. 1999/2000 saw their biggest ever NSL win, a 6–0 defeat of South Melbourne in January 2000 at Belmore Sports Ground. The club would again make the Finals that season, finishing in 5th place. During the Finals Series Sydney Olympic beat Adelaide City over 2 legs, but would go on to lose to Carlton SC in extra-time, for a spot in the Preliminary Final.\n\nIn season 2000/01, Sydney Olympic finished 4th on the competition ladder. In the Finals Series, Olympic eliminated Marconi and then Melbourne Knights to make it through to the Preliminary Final, a match they lost 2–0 to the Minor Premiers South Melbourne.\n\nSeason 2001/02 saw the club move base again, this time to the Sutherland Shire in Sydney's south, an area with no NSL representation, but a large base of registered junior players to potentially tap into. Olympic played out of Toyota Park. The move had also involved a change of name from Sydney Olympic to Olympic Sharks with the traditional blue and white colours of the club still in place. This season also saw Olympic capture their 2nd NSL Championship, a lone Ante Milicic goal early in the second-half, being enough to defeat Perth Glory at Subiaco Oval in front of 42,735 fans.\n\nThe 2002/03 season saw Sydney Olympic win its first ever Minor Premiership by finishing on top of the NSL ladder, which eventually led to Olympic's second consecutive appearance in the NSL Grand Final. This time however, it would be the Perth Glory who would take out the title, winning 2–0 in Perth, in front of 38,111 fans.\n\nDespite the on field successes, the move to the Sutherland Shire was short-lived. Poor attendances took their toll on the venture and for season 2003/04 the club chose to revert to the widely preferred name of Sydney Olympic and moving to OKI Jubilee Stadium at Kogarah.\n\nFollowing the demise of the NSL in 2004, Sydney Olympic participated in the 2004/05 NSW Premier League season and just missed out on the Finals Series. In 2006 Sydney Olympic returned to Belmore Sports Ground where the club had a mid-table finish of 6th.\n\n2007 was a special year for Sydney Olympic as it celebrated the 50th anniversary of its founding, with the club's jersey reverting to the original blue and white vertical striped design. On the field it would turn out to be a forgettable year for the club, as it ended the season in 9th spot.\n\nIn the 2008 season under the stewardship of former player Milan Blagojevic, the club laid the platform for what would be a successful season by capturing the 2008 pre-season Johnny Warren Cup with a gutsy 2–1 win over the Sutherland Sharks. During the regular season, Sydney Olympic finished 3rd on the ladder, their best league finish since the 2002/03 NSL season. In the ensuing Finals Series Olympic were stopped 1 game short of that season's Grand Final losing in the Preliminary Final to Sutherland. The 2008 season also saw Olympic make the Waratah Cup Final, only to lose that Final.\n\nIn season 2009, Sydney Olympic dropped back down the ladder, ending the season in a disappointing 8th spot.\n\nThe new decade would start off in a miserable way. Season 2010 saw Sydney Olympic equal their worst ever league finish, ending the season in 2nd last spot.\n\nIn 2011, Sydney Olympic with a new coaching staff and many new players finished in 1st place, four points clear of Sydney rivals Sydney United FC to claim the Minor Premiership. In the Finals Series Olympic beat Sydney United 2–0 in the Semi-Final and beat them again by the same score-line in the Grand Final, in front of 10,000+ fans at Belmore Sports Ground and went on to become NSW Champions again.\n\n2012 saw Sydney Olympic finish 2nd in the NSW Premier League, but were bundled out of the Finals Series in straight sets and in 2013 Sydney Olympic finished a disappointing 7th.\n\nIn 2014, former Greek international centre-back Sotirios Kyrgiakos signed for the club. Kyrgiakos stated in the press conference; \"It's a beautiful thing for me to come to Sydney & play football in Australia. I wanted to have this experience and this opportunity was available for a handful of games, which was the proposal from the club. I will be thrilled to get to know Australian football and experience it and it's very significant that I'm coming to a very historic club with great Greek support\". Sydney Olympic finished the regular season in 4th, before embarking on an amazing Finals run. Winning 3 sudden death matches in succession to make it to the NSW Grand Final, only to lose 2–1 to Blacktown City after extra-time. In 2014 Sydney Olympic also made it to the FFA Cup Round of 16 only to be defeated 2–1 by Bentleigh Greens after a compressed end of year schedule eventually took its toll on the team.\n\nIn 2015 Sydney Olympic finished 4th in the regular season again after a great end to the regular season, which saw the team win 5 straight matches. After a convincing 2–0 victory in the first week of the Finals against Wollongong Wolves, the team set up a Semi-Final showdown against old rivals APIA Leichhardt, who took a 1–0 lead via a deflection. Sydney Olympic couldn't capitalise on a string of great chances in the second half to equalise, seeing the team eliminated 1–0. In 2015 Sydney Olympic again made it to the Round of 16 stage of the FFA Cup, but were disappointingly eliminated following a 3–1 loss to Hume City FC.\n\nFor 2016, Sydney Olympic endured an up and down season where it finished the season in 6th spot. In 2017, Sydney Olympic reached the Finals again, but were knocked out by Manly United in the first week. The club was also knocked out of the Cup in the early rounds in both 2016 and 2017.\n\nIn 2018, Sydney Olympic returned to winning ways. First clinching the Minor Premiership in a nail-biting last day of the season by leap-frogging old rivals APIA Leichhardt to finish top. This was added to by winning the Grand Final 3-1 and being crowned Champions, also against APIA Leichhardt.\n\nIn 2019, Sydney Olympic experienced an up and down season trying to defend their title from the previous season. Finishing the season 6th, they missed the Finals. They were also knocked out of the Cup in the early rounds.\n\n\"Updated October 11, 2018\"\n\n Australia\n\n\n\n Lebanon\n Liberia\n New Zealand\n\n Scotland\n Uruguay\n Wales\n Netherlands\n\nDirectors\n\nManagement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 6 March 2018, Sydney Olympic announced their thirteenth Hall of Fame inductee.\n\n\n"}

It became effective on 1 April 1937.\n\nHamburg lost most of its exclaves, including Geesthacht and Cuxhaven. In return, Hamburg was enlarged by including formerly Prussian towns like Altona, Wandsbek, and Harburg-Wilhelmsburg as well as a number of villages. Altona and Wandsbek had been part of the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein, while Harburg-Wilhelmsburg had been a part of the Prussian province of Hanover. This represented the formal merger of what had previously been referred to as the \"Four-City Region\".\n\nBesides the regulations for Hamburg, the law incorporated most of the Free City of Lübeck into the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein, though some smaller villages were included in the State of Mecklenburg. This constituted a victory for the Gauleiter (regional party leader) of Schleswig-Holstein, who had competed with the neighbouring Gauleiter of Mecklenburg for control of the city ever since 1933.\n\nUntil the Greater Hamburg Act, Lübeck had been a separate member state of the Reich. Two reasons for ending this status are cited: Adolf Hitler had a distaste for Lübeck ever since the city council forbade him to campaign there in 1932. Also, Lübeck formed part of the compensation given to Prussia for its losses to Hamburg. Besides Lübeck, Prussia also gained Hamburg's territories Geesthacht, which was also incorporated into the province of Schleswig-Holstein, and Ritzebüttel (including Cuxhaven), which went to the Province of Hanover. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "2225281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2225281", "title": "Emily Lloyd", "text": "Emily Lloyd\n\nEmily Lloyd-Pack (born 29 September 1970), known as Emily Lloyd, is an English actress. At the age of 16, Lloyd starred in her debut and breakthrough role in the 1987 film \"Wish You Were Here\", for which she received critical acclaim and 'Best Actress' awards from the National Society of Film Critics and the Evening Standard British Film Awards. She subsequently relocated to Manhattan at 17, and received numerous film offers, starring in the 1989 films \"Cookie\" and \"In Country\".\n\nLloyd's mental health began to suffer in her late teens, and she missed out on several prominent roles due to a combination of factors. She turned down the lead role in the 1990 film \"Pretty Woman\" as she had already agreed to star in \"Mermaids\", from which she was later recast. Lloyd was fired from the 1992 film \"Husbands and Wives\" as her deteriorating health affected her ability to work, and was also replaced in the 1995 film \"Tank Girl\". In 1997, a journalist said Lloyd was \"in danger of becoming better known for the parts she has lost than those she has played\". Though she continued to star in films during this time, she was mostly relegated to supporting roles.\n\nLloyd's mental health continued to deteriorate in later years. While she played the lead role in the 2002 independent film \"The Honeytrap\" to critical acclaim, and also performed in theatrical productions, she had difficulty finding work and was diagnosed with several mental health conditions. By 2013, Lloyd's health had stabilised. That same year she published an autobiography, \"Wish I Was There\".\n\nLloyd was born Emily Lloyd-Pack in London, the daughter of Sheila Hughes (née Laden), a theatrical agent who was a long-time secretary at Harold Pinter's stage agency, and actor Roger Lloyd-Pack. Her grandfather, Charles Lloyd-Pack, was also a stage and film actor. Lloyd's parents separated when she was 18 months old; her father moved out of the family home though Emily continued to live with her mother in Milner Square, Islington. Hughes remarried telephone engineer Martin Ball and had a second daughter, Charlotte, when Lloyd was five; Hughes and Ball separated two months after her birth. Her father married Jehane Markham in 2000; they had three sons: Hartley, Louis and Spencer.\n\nAt the age of 15, Lloyd was taking acting lessons at the Italia Conti School in London. In 1986, director David Leland cast her as Lynda, the leading role in his film \"Wish You Were Here\". The film was based loosely on the memoirs of Cynthia Payne. Lloyd's younger sister Charlotte played the 11-year-old Lynda in a flashback sequence. \"Wish You Were Here\" received an International Federation of Film Critics award at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival, and Lloyd received widespread acclaim for her performance. Roger Ebert said she was the key to the film's performance, calling it \"one of the great debut roles for a young actress\". Lloyd received the 'Best Actress' award from the National Society of Film Critics in 1987, and also at the 1987 Evening Standard British Film Awards. She was also nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role in 1988.\n\nFollowing her success, Steven Spielberg warned her to not get involved in the film industry and to be \"a kid and go to Disneyland\". Lloyd, however, moved to Manhattan where she was living alone at 17. She received numerous film offers, and reportedly beat over 5,000 actresses, including Jodie Foster, for the lead role in the 1989 film \"Cookie\". Lloyd reported that her mental health deteriorated in Manhattan, and she began developing a tic, had difficulty concentrating and was hearing voices. She later said she was aware she needed help but did not know how to go about getting treatment. Her co-star in \"Cookie\", Peter Falk, became so frustrated with her behaviour during filming that he slapped her, after which she slapped him back. Lloyd's performance in \"Cookie\" was praised by \"The New York Times\".\n\nHer next role was in the 1989 film \"In Country\" opposite Bruce Willis, though the two stars reportedly did not get along during filming. Rick Groen from \"The Globe and Mail\" praised Lloyd's performance as \"letter perfect – her accent impeccable and her energy immense\". Lloyd had to turn down an offer for the lead role in \"Pretty Woman\", as she had already been contracted to star in the 1990 film \"Mermaids\". Lloyd was cast as the daughter of the character played by the film's star, Cher. Cher, however, thought that Lloyd did not look enough like her to portray her daughter and complained about her casting. The original director of the film, Lasse Hallström, was fired at Cher's insistence, and Lloyd was subsequently told she was no longer required. Her part was given to Winona Ryder. Lloyd sued Orion Pictures for breach of contract and received US$175,000 in damages. \n\nHer next role was in the 1990 film \"Chicago Joe and the Showgirl\"; Roger Ebert commented that Lloyd \"shows again, in only her fourth role, what a remarkable new talent she is.\" Shortly thereafter she began dating Gavin Rossdale. According to Lloyd the relationship was troubled, and one night at his apartment alone, she attempted suicide by taking aspirin and slashing her wrists. She was found by one of Rossdale's friends and spent the next six weeks in hospital. She was cast in Woody Allen's 1992 film \"Husbands and Wives\", but was fired by him after two weeks due to her ill health. Allen complained Lloyd was spending too much time in her trailer; Lloyd later stated that was because she was making herself vomit. Later in 1992, she had a supporting role in Robert Redford's \"A River Runs Through It\". \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said that Lloyd provided \"another memorable performance\", while Malcolm Johnson from the \"Hartford Courant\" said she and co-star Brad Pitt brought \"verve and charm\" to the film. In 1995, she was initially cast as the eponymous lead character for the film \"Tank Girl\". The film's director, Rachel Talalay, states she fired Lloyd for refusing to shave her head for the role. Lloyd, who had spent four months training for the film, disputes this, saying she simply rescheduled her appointment with the film's hair stylist to the following day, after which Talalay ostensibly fired her for \"being difficult\". Lloyd said she was actually fired due to their personality clashes. Lloyd states she \"went to pieces\" after \"Tank Girl\", believing she was cursed. After she finished filming \"Under the Hula Moon\" later that year she returned to London. She was offered a role on the TV series \"Casualty\", though left production as she found she was too unwell to work. Shortly thereafter, she was also diagnosed with Tourette syndrome, and after being prescribed several types of medication and then experimenting with crack cocaine, was referred to the psychiatric ward at Homerton University Hospital for six months. In 1996, she appeared in the Sean Bean football film \"When Saturday Comes\".\n\nIn 1997, Lloyd went to India where she consumed the anti-malaria drug mefloquine, which is contraindicated for people with mental disorders. While on the trip, she was bitten by one of the Dalai Lama's dogs while waiting to meet with him. Lloyd attributes the combination of the drug and the attack to causing a subsequent mental breakdown. Lloyd's mother stated that when her daughter came back after only a week in India she had lost a considerable amount of weight and the two barely recognised one another. Lloyd developed obsessive-compulsive disorder thereafter, and struggled with the condition. Despite this, she continued to work in film, having a supporting role in the critically acclaimed 1997 film \"Welcome to Sarajevo\", and also appeared in the film \"Boogie Boy\" that year. In 1998, she appeared in the film \"Brand New World\", her last performance until she played the lead role in the independent thriller \"The Honeytrap\" in 2002, for which she received critical acclaim. The following year, she starred in the film \"Riverworld\".\n\nLloyd made her début on the stage in 1996 as Bella Kooling in \"Max Klapper\" at the Electric Cinema. In 1997, she was cast as Eliza Doolittle in the Albery Theatre production of \"Pygmalion\", produced by Bill Kenwright. It was to be her West End debut. Shortly after rehearsals began, the original director Giles Havergal walked out, with reports he found Lloyd impossible to work with. Lloyd later left the production herself, citing an issue with another member of the cast. A journalist from \"The Independent\" subsequently commented that Lloyd was \"in danger of becoming better known for the parts she has lost than those she has played\". In 2003, she appeared as Ophelia in \"Hamlet\" at the Shakespeare Festival in Leeds and Brighton. Lloyd spoke positively of her experience in the play, though according to \"The Daily Telegraph \", one reviewer said her performance left audiences \"visibly cringing\".\n\nBy 2003, Lloyd was struggling to find acting work. Cassandra Jardine from \"The Daily Telegraph\" stated that during an interview Lloyd frequently lost track of her sentences, stared into the distance and made sudden exclamations for no apparent reason. Lloyd attributed her mental state to the mefloquine exacerbating her existing anxiety and depression issues, and attributed her lack of regular acting work to these conditions and the stigma surrounding mental illness. By this time, Lloyd had lost contact with her Hollywood connections, and had had to sell the London apartment she bought with her film earnings. In 2005, she was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder, and told Suzanne Kerrins from the \"Sunday Mirror\" that while she did receive film offers, she was focusing on getting better, adding that she sometimes wished she had never been given the role in \"Wish You Were Here\" as it had been \"both a blessing and a curse\". Lloyd said she did not want anybody's sympathy, rather she just wanted \"to feel well again\". In April 2013, Lloyd stated that she had been calm and stable for the past few years. She said she had no regrets regarding her life, though wished \"that on a few occasions [she'd] been able to enjoy the experiences fully\". In May 2013, Lloyd published an autobiography, \"Wish I Was There\". Following the birth of her daughter in 2014, Lloyd stated she was happy and that her mental illness had \"faded into the background\". In 2016, she had a role in the film \"No Reasons\".\n\nLloyd's only public long-term relationship was with Danny Huston. The couple split in 1995. In 2013, she revealed had been sexually abused by a family friend when she was five, which was a major cause of her anxiety and depression in later life. In October 2014, Lloyd had a daughter, Arrabelle, with her partner, vocalist Christian Jupp.\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

David and his siblings were placed in an orphanage when he was four. From that time until 1972, when he escaped from legal custody, he spent his life in a number of orphanages, boys' homes and youth training centres.\n\nAt the age of 11 David began committing various offences including larceny, making threats and offence's of dishonesty. When he was 13, he was first diagnosed as having a personality disorder with psychopathic traits. David was subsequently admitted to psychiatric facilities on eight separate occasions between 1976 and 1984, and was variously diagnosed with antisocial, borderline, histrionic and narcissistic personality disorders. It was during this time that he began self-mutilating to an extreme degree. Among other things, he swallowed razor blades, cut off parts of his ears and his left nipple, injured his genitals, hammered nails into his feet and swallowed corrosive liquids.\n\nIn 1982 David was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment for the attempted murder of three people, during a robbery-gone-wrong at a pizza restaurant in Rye, Victoria. The robbery appeared to be an attempt to draw police into a shootout. The pizza shop owner and one of the responding police officers were severely wounded in the incident, while David was wounded in the legs by police. A news crew spotted David fleeing the scene and he was arrested.\n\nWhilst imprisoned, David wrote many manuscripts, one titled \"Blueprint for Urban Warfare\", which spoke of committing upon his release from prison. The \"Blueprint\" listed 49 \"combat situations\", ranging from horror movie clichés (cigarette machines dispensing severed fingers, drink machines dispensing blood) to far more disturbing scenarios, such as the bombing of bridges and public buildings, the assassination of prominent politicians, the poisoning of water supplies and indiscriminate shooting in public places. David later claimed that he had been instructed to write his more graphic fantasies down as a form of therapy. He also manifested a great deal of hostility to the police force and prison system, resorting to violence and self-mutilation whenever his requests or demands were not met. In January 1990, David was declared mentally ill by government health department officials. The \"Mental Health Act 1986\" entitled David the right to appeal, which he did in February and March 1990. In May 1990 the board found David was not mentally ill and recommended he be discharged as an involuntary patient. This was a consequence of the Board's assertion that a personality disorder is not a mental illness as per the \"Mental Health Act\".\n\nThe Victorian Government faced the dilemma of respecting David's right to freedom and the protection of the community upon his release from prison. The government sought to keep David imprisoned indefinitely by introducing the \"Community Protection Act 1990\". That legislation gave Victorian Supreme Court judges the power to hold David in \"preventative detention\" for twelve months if the judge was convinced by evidence before them that David was still a risk to the community and likely to commit further offences if released from prison.\n\nDavid was an intelligent man, with significant literary, analytical and computer skills. But as he had a long history of responding to the most minor frustrations with violence, damage to property and self-harm, and refused on principle to co-operate with attempts to reduce such behaviours prior to his re-entry to society, the Supreme Court repeatedly applied the legislation to continue his confinement.\n\nDavid committed suicide by ingesting razor blades that led to peritonitis; he died on 11 June 1993. At the time of his death aged 38, David was still a prisoner and had spent a total of 33 years in various institutions.\n\nA similar act was passed by the Parliament of New South Wales in an attempt to enforce similar preventative detention against a named individual. This act was challenged in Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) and overturned as unconstitutional.\n\nThe song, “He's On The Run” by Gene Bradley Fisk was written about David.\n\n\n"}

The album reached number 21 on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart, and the two singles \"Under My Wheels\" and \"Be My Lover\" made the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nCooper said in the liner notes of \"A Fistful of Alice\" and \"In the Studio with Redbeard\", which spotlighted the \"Killer\" and \"Love It to Death\" albums, that the song \"Desperado\" was written about his friend Jim Morrison, who died the year this album was released. According to an NPR radio interview with Alice Cooper, \"Desperado\" was written about Robert Vaughn's character from the movie \"The Magnificent Seven\". \"Halo of Flies\" was, according to Cooper's liner notes in the compilation \"The Definitive Alice Cooper\", an attempt by the band to prove that they could perform King Crimson-like progressive rock suites, and was supposedly about a SMERSH-like organisation. \"Desperado\", along with \"Under My Wheels\" and \"Be My Lover\" have appeared on different compilation albums by Cooper. The song \"Dead Babies\" stirred up some controversy following the album's release, despite the fact that its lyrics conveyed an \"anti-child abuse\" message.\n\n\"Rolling Stone\"'s Lester Bangs gave it a favorable review. He explained that \"it brings all the elements of the band's approach to sound and texture to a totally integrated pinnacle that fulfills all the promise of their erratic first two albums\" and that \"each song on [the] album finds him in a different role in the endless movie he is projecting on them.\" He concluded by calling Alice Cooper \"a strong band, a vital band, and they are going to be around for a long, long time.\" Robert Christgau rated the album a B-, stating that \"a taste for the base usages of hard rock rarely comes with a hit attached these days, much less 'surreal', 'theatrical', and let us not forget 'transvestite' trappings\". However, he said that \"[the album] falters after 'Under My Wheels' and 'Be My Lover', neither of them an 'I'm Eighteen' in the human outreach department.\" AllMusic's Greg Prato rated \"Killer\" four-and-a-half out of five stars. He stated that \"disturbing tracks ... fit in perfectly\" and that \"other songs were even more exceptional\". He concluded by pointing out that \"it rewarded them as being among the most notorious and misunderstood entertainers, thoroughly despised by grownups.\"\n\nThe album reached on the \"Billboard\" album chart and two singles made the Hot 100 chart. \"Be My Lover\" reached on the \"Billboard\" chart and \"Under My Wheels\" reached .\n\"Killer\" is the third-most-represented album in Alice Cooper’s concert setlists behind \"Welcome to My Nightmare\" and \"Billion Dollar Babies\", accounting for 13.3 percent of the songs he has played live. Alongside \"Welcome to My Nightmare\", it is one of only two Alice Cooper albums where every song has been played live, although “Yeah, Yeah, Yeah” has never been played since the end of the supporting \"Killer Tour\", while “You Drive Me Nervous” was not played subsequent to the \"Killer Tour\" until 1999, and has never been performed since 2006. “Desperado” was performed only once prior to the \"Trash Tour\" in 1989, but has been frequently played live since.\n\nJohnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols and Public Image Ltd called \"Killer\" the greatest rock album of all time. Punk icons Jello Biafra & The Melvins covered the song \"Halo of Flies\" on their 2005 release \"Sieg Howdy!\". Minneapolis rock band Halo of Flies took their name from this song as well. Psychobilly musicians Mojo Nixon and Skid Roper covered the song \"Be My Lover\" on their 1986 release \"Frenzy\". Power metal band Iced Earth covered the song \"Dead Babies\" for their 2002 release \"Tribute to the Gods\". Guns N' Roses (featuring Alice Cooper) covered the song \"Under My Wheels\" on the soundtrack of \"The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years\".\n\nwith:\n\n"}

Its name comes from the Romans, who ate them as a delicacy.\n\nThe edible dormouse is the largest of all dormice, being around in head-body length, plus an 11- to 13-cm-long tail. It normally weighs from , but may almost double in weight immediately prior to hibernation. It has a generally squirrel-like body, with small ears, short legs, and large feet. Its fur is grey to greyish-brown in colour over most of the body, while the underparts and the inner surface of legs are white to pale buff; the line of demarcation is rather well defined.\n\nUnlike most other dormice, they have no dark markings on the face, aside from faint rings around the eyes. The tail is long and bushy, with fur slightly darker than that on the body. Front feet have four digits and their hind feet have five. The soles of their feet are naked. Females have from four to six pairs of teats.\n\nThe edible dormouse is capable of limited autotomy; if another animal grasps the tail, the skin breaks easily and slides off the underlying bone, allowing the dormouse to escape. The exposed vertebrae then break off and the wound heals over, forming a fresh brush of hair.\n\nThe edible dormouse is found throughout much of mainland western Europe. It is also found on a number of Mediterranean islands, including Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily, and Crete. It is rather more sparsely distributed through central Europe and the Balkans, but can be found as far north-east as the upper Volga River. Close to the Volga River where small groups of the species are found at the Zhiguli Mountains, in Russia. They are also found in the Caucasus region, and along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. Germany has a small population of edible dormice within its borders, ranging from two to six individuals per hectare.\n\nIt is also found in scattered populations throughout Thrace, located on the southeastern tip of the European Balkan peninsula. In this region, two subspecies of the edible dormouse are found, \"G. g. glis\" and \"G. g. orientalis\". Northern Anatolia has a different subspecies, \"G. g pindicus\".\nA small, isolated population of \"Glis glis\" also exists in south-east England. At the turn of the 20th century, the British banker and zoologist Lionel Walter Rothschild kept \"Glis glis\" in his private collection in the town of Tring in Hertfordshire; in 1902 some of the animals escaped and reproduced, establishing themselves in the wild as an invasive species. Today, the British edible dormouse population is thought to be 10,000 strong, and \"Glis glis\" have been recorded in an radius of Tring, mostly concentrated to the south and east. The area of distribution has been described as triangle between Beaconsfield, Aylesbury, and Luton, around the southeast side of the Chiltern Hills.\n\nEdible dormice inhabit deciduous forests dominated by oak and beech, from sea level to the upper limits of such forests at . They prefer dense forests with rocky cliffs and caves, but may be found in maquis vegetation, orchards, and urban margins. They have frequently been reported from caves as deep as , where they can shelter from predators.\n\nPopulation densities range from two to 22 individuals per hectare. Females inhabit only very small home ranges, of , but males occupy much larger ranges of , with several burrows.\n\nEdible dormice are primarily herbivorous, feeding mainly on berries, apples, and nuts. However, they are adaptable, and have also been reported to eat bark, leaves, flowers, invertebrates, and even eggs. Beech mast, which is rich in energy and protein, is an excellent source of food for young and lactating females. Some dormice are found to have hair and ectoparasite remains in their stomachs, but this is mainly due to accidental ingestion during grooming.\n\nEdible dormice also consume large numbers of beech tree seeds. A single, large, seeding tree within the home range of a dormouse can produce enough resources to support the energy requirements of reproduction. The location and age of a beech tree helps dictate where a population of dormice live, since older trees produce more seeds.\n\nEdible dormice are nocturnal, spending the day in nests taken from birds, or located in hollow trees or similar shelter. They are good climbers, and spend most of their time in the trees, although they are relatively poor jumpers. The dormouse uses sticky secretions of plantar glands when they are climbing on smooth surfaces to prevent them from falling. They generally stay in the forest and avoid open areas to any extent. They are not generally social animals, although small groups of closely related adults have occasionally been reported. Many edible dormice mothers form communal nesting areas where they care for their young together.\n\nCommunication is partly by sound, with the animals making various squeaks or snuffling sounds, and partly by scent. They leave scent trails from scent glands on their feet, as well as glands at the top of their tails by the anus. They rub their anal region on the ground and places they walk, so traces of the secretion will be left for other dormice, especially during periods of sexual activity.\n\nEdible dormice are active during a six-month period and go into hibernation from roughly October to May, depending on local climatic conditions. They are mostly active in the summer and are active on average 202 min in a 24-hour day, mostly at night. They prepare a den in soft soil or hidden in a cave, and rely on fat reserves to survive through the winter. During hibernation, metabolic rate and body temperature fall dramatically, and the animal may cease breathing altogether for periods up to an hour. In years with low food availability edible dormice can hibernate longer than 11 months.\n\nIn the wild, most edible dormice hibernate for three winters, and then die in the fourth while hibernating, when their cheek teeth are worn out to a degree that prevents normal mastication of food.\n\nTheir primary predators include owls, foxes, pine martens, and wildcats.\n\nThe breeding season is from late June to mid August, but both male and female dormice do not produce every year. Variation in food resources strongly influences reproduction because reproduction is tightly linked to the availability of energy-rich seeds. Therefore, edible dormice breed during the phase of high food availability. Females are able to produce additional young if amino acid-rich foods like inflorescences, unripe seeds, and (or) larval insects, which also increase their numbers by eating the same enriched plant food, are available. An abundance of energy-rich seeds allows newborn dormice to increase their body fat to prepare for their first hibernation. Females reach sexual maturity at 351–380 days old and males significantly lower their body mass during mating season.\n\nMales are not territorial, and may visit the territories of several nearby females to mate, becoming aggressive to any other males they encounter. The male attracts a female by squeaking, then conducts a circular courtship dance before mounting her. During mating season, males lower their body mass and use their body fat reserves to help fuel the energetic costs of reproduction.\n\nGestation lasts from 20–31 days, and results in the birth of up to 11 young, although four or five are more typical. They develop their fur by 16 days, and open their eyes after around 3 weeks. They begin to leave the nest after around 30 days, and are sexually mature by the time they complete their second hibernation. Compared with similarly sized mammals, they have an unusually long lifespan, and have been reported to live up to 12 years in the wild.\n\nThe breeding habits of the edible dormouse have been cited as a possible cause of its unusual pattern of telomere lengthening with age. In humans and other animals, telomeres almost always shorten with age.\n\nAlthough the edible dormouse is the only living member of its genus, a number of fossil species are also known. The genus \"Glis\" first originated in the middle Oligocene, although it did not become common until the Pliocene. By the Pleistocene, only one species, \"G. sackdillingensis\", is known to have survived, and this is likely the ancestor of the modern species, which first appeared in the early to mid-Pleistocene.\n\nEdible dormice that have been isolated on oceanic islands are a prime example of insular gigantism, in which small animals in isolated locations become larger over the course of many generations. Although it is not known why, the number of teats on a female edible dormouse varies across regions of Europe. For example, those in Italy have two to seven, while those in Lithuania have three to six.\n\n\"Glis glis\" have adapted well to the presence of humans and now frequently hibernate in insulated attics and even dark shelves in cupboards, particularly if soft materials are on the shelf to make a nest. In this situation, they are generally regarded as a pest due to the fire risk from gnawed electrical cables and fouling from their faeces. Instances of house fire have been attributed to electrical fires caused by wires chewed by \"Glis glis\".\n\nDespite being regarded as a pest in the United Kingdom, the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 prohibits certain methods of killing dormice. This is because the \"Gliridae\" family of rodents is protected internationally under the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, to which the United Kingdom is a signatory. Removing edible dormice from a property may only be carried out by a qualified pest controller licensed by Natural England using spring traps. The animals must then be humanely destroyed after capture.\n\nWhen present in large numbers, edible dormice may cause damage to orchards and be considered pests.\n\nThe edible dormouse was farmed and eaten by the ancient Romans, the Gauls, and the Etruscans (usually as a snack), hence the word edible in its name. The Romans would catch dormice from the wild in autumn when they were fattest. The dormice were kept and raised either in large pits or (in less spacious urban surroundings) in terra cotta containers, the \"gliraria\", something like contemporary hamster cages. They fed these captive dormice walnuts, chestnuts, and acorns for fattening. The dormice were served by either roasting them and dipping them in honey or stuffing them with a mixture of pork, pine nuts, and other flavorings. It was, however, very important to upper-class Romans that the dormice be separated from other products of the hunt, like the large game, for presentation purposes.\n\nWild edible dormice are still consumed in Slovenia, as well as in Croatia. In Slovenia they are considered a rare delicacy and dormouse trapping is a tradition. Slovenians use several methods of trapping. The first used were the hollow-tree trapping method and the flat-stone trapping method. By the 17th century, the peasant trappers had invented the first self-triggering traps, usually made of different kinds of wood. In the 19th century, traps made from iron and steel were introduced. The trappers used many different types of bait to entice the dormice, ranging from pieces of fruit to bacon soaked in brandy. During the prime season, trappers could catch between 200 and 400 dormice, depending largely on what kind of trap they were using. Seasonal dormice feasts were welcome protein supplements for the impoverished peasantry. The people of Slovenia did not just catch the dormice for their meat: use of dormice for food and fur and of dormouse fat as a medicament is documented there since the 13th century.\n\n"}

Mr. Hitchcock who was then the District Superintendent of Police, South Malabar realized the imperative need to raise a special force, organized, armed and equipped on the lines of an Indian infantry battalion to deal effectively problems threatening public peace. This suggestion, strongly endorsed by the District Magistrate, was accepted by the Viceroy's Government on 30 September 1921, which then sanctioned a strength of 6 British Officers, 8 Subedars, 16 Jemadars, 60 Havildars and 600 Constables to be formed into 6 companies of Auxiliary Police.\n\nIn the following year, members of the force were drafted into Madras Presidency to counter the rebellion in the Rampa area that was being led by Alluri Sitarama Raju.

The butterfly was first introduced to Europe in the late 20th century, where it has quickly spread to many southern and eastern European regions. Since its introduction to Europe, the geranium bronze butterfly has become a pest to cultivated \"Pelargonium\" and \"Geranium\" plant species. Currently, efforts are being made to contain the spread of the geranium bronze butterflies as well as to determine the most effective pesticide for the species.\n\nThe adult geranium bronze butterfly's wingspan ranges from 15–23 mm in males and 18–23 mm in females . The wings are brown/bronze with a white border outlining the wings. The underside is a grey-brown with darker bands interlaced with white, creating an intricate pattern. The hindwings contain an eye spot in order to divert predators from attacking. The male and female are similar in appearance.\n\nThe geranium bronze was first recorded in regions of South Africa, including Natal, Swaziland, Botswana, Zimbabwe, the Cape Provinces, Lesotho, and Mozambique. It was accidentally brought to Europe in 1978. After being recorded in England, a colony of geranium bronze was soon found in Mallorca in 1990, and has since spread to most of the regions in southern Europe. In 1996, the geranium bronze butterfly was first recorded in Rome, Italy, and rapidly spread along the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian coastal areas before extending inland. The geranium bronze butterfly now has established colonies in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, France, Greece, Malta, Spain, Portugal, southern Switzerland, Slovenia, Croatia, and the French Mediterranean.\n\nAfter hatching, the geranium bronze larvae feed on the flower buds, young leaves, and soft stems of their host plant, typically from the genera \"Pelargonium\" and \"Geranium\". In order to eat the stem of these plants, the larvae drill into the stems, causing damage to the plants.\n\nGeranium bronze eggs are small with a slight green color that turns white then brown or light-yellow before the larva hatches. The eggs are 0.5 mm in diameter and 0.3 mm in height. The eggs are typically laid close to the flower buds, but are occasionally laid on the leaves. The laying of eggs usually occurs during summer months, while caterpillar activity has been recorded in the summer, fall, and winter.\nOnce hatched, the larvae bore through the stem of the host plant, where they are typically found within the stem or flower buds. The plant stem usually turns black after being invaded by larvae. The larva feeds on the host plant, damaging the host until it enters the pupa stage.\n\nDuring the first instar stage, the caterpillar's average length is 1 mm, which will increase to 2 mm during the following 8 days. Second instar caterpillars grow to an average of 3 mm; third instars to 6 mm; and fourth instars grow to 13 mm. The second, third, and fourth instar stages occur for a duration of 8, 8, and 9 days, respectively. The color of the caterpillars can vary. Most caterpillars are yellow or green, and may have pink markings.\n\nThe pupa stage occurs at the bottom of the flower peduncle in many of the host species. The peduncles offer the best protection for the caterpillars, which is why the caterpillars will typically remain at the base of the flower until metamorphosis occurs. It has been suggested that geranium bronze may overwinter as either a caterpillar or a pupa, although further data is needed to confirm this.\n\nThe pupa color varies, but they are typically green, pale-yellow, or brown. The pupa are hairy and are typically 9 mm long.\n\nAdults are on wing year-round in warmer areas, but usually from August to May in South Africa. At higher altitudes, adults are on wing in December and January.\n\nGeranium bronze have spread from their native regions of South Africa to numerous southern and eastern European regions. This was likely due to accidental transportation of plants infested with geranium bronze larvae and not due to any natural migration patterns. The geranium bronze butterflies fly for short periods of time and frequently rest.\n\nThe geranium bronze butterfly has not been reported as a pest in its native home and surrounding South African regions. It is believed that the butterfly has not become a pest in the South African regions because of an indigenous predator or parasitoid that has kept the butterfly population low. The predator has yet to be identified.\n\nGeranium bronze females prefer to lay their eggs on the flower buds of various \"Geranium\" species. They typically oviposit on top of and underneath leaves, but infrequently on stems. Geranium bronze butterflies are multivoltine, meaning they lay two or more broods per year.\n\nGeranium bronze typically lay eggs on plants from genera \"Pelargonium\" and \"Geranium\", both in the family Geraniaceae. Once hatched, these plants act as hosts to the larvae. Quacchia et al. (2008) found that geranium bronze butterflies in Italy displayed preference for egg laying on \"Geranium sanguineum, Geranium sylvaticum, and Geranium pratense\" Data was collected from a 2-year observation in various regions of Piedmont and the Aosta Valley, Italy. Plant preference and offspring fitness (using wingspan as a marker for fitness) were analyzed, but no statistically significant correlation was found.\n\nGeranium bronze butterflies pose a large threat to \"Pelargonium\" species in Europe. European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization currently lists geranium bronze as an A2 quarantine pest for Europe, and an A1 quarantine pest for Turkey. If geranium bronze numbers in Italy and other regions of Europe continue to rise, it is possible that they will become a larger threat for not only the native flora, but also for local biodiversity. Geranium bronze may start to be in competition with indigenous lycaenid species whose only food source is \"Geranium\" plants, such as \"E. eumedon\" and \"A. nicias.\"\n\nUnfortunately, as pests, the geranium bronze butterflies have caused economic troubles as well. In countries like Spain, the \"Geranium\" plant species are highly bought in Spanish homes as ornaments. According to Sarto i Monteys et al., these plants are highly important in both sales and in employment for both production and marketing (Sarto i Monteys V 1991). In Spain alone, there are four major \"Geranium\" plant companies, together collecting over $30 million a year in the market. Companies have already seen drops in sales as the \"Geraniums\" have been affected by these butterflies. Currently, research is being done to find effective ways to prevent the attacks by these butterflies, but unfortunately many possible insecticides are too chemically potent on the plants that control of these butterflies has been difficult.\n\nThere is a large body of research on the use of pesticides on geranium bronze butterflies.

Though primarily an air-to-ground weapon, it saw limited use in other roles. Its warhead gave rise to the alternative name of the \"60-pound rocket\"; the solid-shot armour-piercing variant was referred to as the \"25-pound rocket\". They were generally used by British fighter-bomber aircraft against targets such as tanks, trains, motor transport and buildings, and by Coastal Command and Royal Navy aircraft against U-boats and shipping. The \"3 inch\" designation referred to the diameter of the rocket motor tube.\n\nThe first use of rockets fired from aircraft was during World War I. The \"unrotated projectiles\" (UPs) were Le Prieur rockets which were mounted on the interplane struts of Nieuport fighters. These were used to attack observation balloons and were reasonably successful. Sopwith Baby and Pup and Home Defence B.E.2 fighters also carried rockets.\nWith the war ended the Royal Air Force, intent on retrenching, forgot about firing rockets from aircraft. The British Army, however, did see a use for rockets against low-flying aircraft; from late 1940 parts of Britain were defended by increasing numbers of \"Z-Batteries\" rockets supplementing the conventional anti-aircraft guns.\n\nWhen German forces under the command of Rommel intervened in the Western Desert from early 1941, it became clear that the Desert Air Force lacked weapons capable of damaging or destroying the large numbers of armoured fighting vehicles, particularly the heavier Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks possessed by the Germans. Consequently, in April 1941 Henry Tizard, the Chief Scientist, called together a panel to study \"Methods of Attacking Armoured Vehicles.\"\n\nThe types of weapons investigated included the 40 mm Vickers S gun and related weapons manufactured by the Coventry Ordnance Works, as well as the Bofors 40 mm and the US 37 mm T9 cannon fitted to the Bell P-39 Airacobra: however, it was already recognised that these weapons were only capable of dealing with light tanks and motor transport, and using larger weapons on fighter-bombers was ruled out because of weight and difficulties handling recoil. The chairman of the panel, Mr. Ivor Bowen (Assistant Director of Armament Research) turned to the idea of using rocket projectiles as a means of delivering a large warhead capable of destroying or disabling heavy tanks. Information was sought from the Soviets, who had just started using unguided RS-82 rockets against German ground forces in the opening phases of Operation Barbarossa.\n\nBy September 1941 it was decided that two models of UP would be developed:\n\nWhen it was realised that the 2-inch version would be less effective than the Vickers S cannon, it was decided to concentrate on development of the 3-inch version, which could be developed from the 2-inch rocket used in the Z-Batteries.\n\nThe rocket body was a steel tube in diameter filled with of cordite propellant, fired electrically. The warhead was screwed into the forward end, and was initially a solid , armor-piercing shell which was quickly supplemented by a , high-explosive head. Another type of head was a mild steel (later concrete) practice head. Once the rocket had been mounted on the rails, an electrical lead (or \"pigtail\") was plugged into the exhaust of the rocket.\n\nFour large tailfins induced enough spin to stabilize the rocket, but as it was unguided, aiming was a matter of judgment and experience. Approach to the target needed to be precise, with no sideslip or yaw, which could throw the RP off line. Aircraft speed had to be precise at the moment of launch, and the angle of attack required precision. Trajectory drop was also a problem, especially at longer ranges.\n\nOn the plus side the rocket was less complicated and more reliable than a gun firing a shell, and there was no recoil on firing. It was found to be a demoralising form of attack against ground troops, and the 60-pound warhead could be devastating. The rocket installations were light enough to be carried by single-seat fighters, giving them the punch of a cruiser. Against slow-moving large targets like shipping and U-boats, the rocket was a formidable weapon.\n\nThe weight and drag of the all-steel rails initially fitted to British aircraft blunted performance. Some aircraft such as the Fairey Swordfish had steel \"anti-blast\" panels fitted under the rails to protect the wing, which further increased weight and drag. Aluminium Mark III rails, introduced from late 1944, reduced the effect. American experience with their own rockets (the USAAF's 3.5-Inch Forward Firing Aircraft Rocket (FFAR) and the USN's 5-inch FFAR & HVAR) showed that the long rails and anti-blast panels were unnecessary; zero-length launchers were introduced in May 1945. British aircraft started being fitted with \"zero-point\" mounting pylons in the post-war years.\n\nThe 3-inch rocket motors (less warhead) were used in the bunker buster Disney bomb, 19 of them propelling the bomb to at impact with the target.\n\nBefore the new weapon was released for service extensive tests were carried out by the Instrument, Armament and Defence Flight (IADF) at Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough. Hurricanes were fitted with rockets and rails and flown during June and July 1942. Further tests were undertaken from 28 September to 30 November to develop rocket firing tactics. Other aircraft used were a Hudson, a Swordfish, a Boston II and a Sea Hurricane.\nAt the same time the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE) had to develop tactics for all the individual aircraft types which were to be armed with the RPs.\nAiming was through a standard GM.II reflector gunsight. A later modification enabled the reflector to be tilted with the aid of a graduated scale, depressing the line of sight, the GM.IIL. For rockets only the Mk IIIA was the most successful – it was used on the Ventura and Hudson.\n\nThe first operational use of the RP was in the Western Desert as a \"tank-busting\" weapon on Hawker Hurricane Mk. IIEs and IVs. The 25-pound armour-piercing heads were found to be ineffective against the Tiger I tanks coming into German service. With the example of the success of Royal Artillery gunners using high-explosive shells from the 25 pdr gun-howitzer, it was decided to design a new 60-pound semi-armour-piercing (SAP) head. These were capable of knocking turrets off tanks.\n\nA typical RP-3 installation was 4 projectiles on launching rails under each wing. A selector switch was fitted to allow the pilot to fire them singly (later omitted), in pairs, or as a full salvo. Towards the end of the war some RAF Second Tactical Air Force Hawker Typhoons had their installation adapted to carry an additional four rockets doubled up under the eight already fitted.\n\nPossibly the best known action involving RP-3s was that of the Falaise pocket of mid-August 1944. During the battle German forces, retreating to avoid being trapped in a pincer movement by Allied ground forces, came under air attack. Amongst the waves of light, medium and fighter bombers attacking the German columns the Typhoons of 2 TAF attacked with their rockets, claiming hundreds of tanks and \"mechanised enemy transport\". After the battle Army and 2nd TAF Operational Research Sections studying the battleground came to the conclusion that far fewer vehicles (17 in total) had been destroyed by rocket strike alone. What was clear was that in the heat of battle it was far harder for pilots to launch the weapons while meeting the conditions needed for accuracy. Smoke, dust and debris in the target areas made accurate assessment of the damage caused almost impossible.\n\nBut it was also clear rocket attacks devastated the morale of enemy troops – many vehicles were found abandoned intact, or with only superficial damage. Interrogation of captured prisoners showed that even the prospect of rocket attack was extremely unnerving for them.\n\nSoon after some encouraging results from the initial deployment, trials of the weapon were conducted against targets representing U-boats. It was discovered that if the rockets were fired at a shallow angle, near misses resulted in the rockets curving upwards in seawater and piercing the targets below the waterline. Soon Coastal Command and the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm aircraft were using the rockets extensively.\n\nThe first U-Boat destroyed with the assistance of a rocket attack was \"U-752\" (Kapitän-Leutnant Schroeter), on 23 May 1943, by a Swordfish of 819 NAS. The rockets used on this occasion had solid, cast-iron heads and were known as \"rocket spears\". One of these punched right through the submarine's pressure hull and rendered it incapable of diving; the U–boat was scuttled by its crew. On 28 May 1943, a 608 Squadron Hudson destroyed a U-boat in the Mediterranean, the first destroyed solely by rocket. These rockets were, among other factors, credited with making it too dangerous for the Germans to continue operating their Flak U-Boats, which were initially designed with heavy anti-aircraft weaponry to hold off air attacks.\n\nFrom then until the end of the Second World War in Europe, Coastal Command and the Fleet Air Arm used the rockets as one of their primary weapons (alongside torpedoes, which, to a certain extent they replaced) against shipping and surfaced U-Boats.\n\nIn 1945, some British Shermans were fitted with two or four rails – one or two either side of the turret – to carry 60-pound headed rockets. These were used at the Rhine Crossing by tanks of the 1st Coldstream Guards. The tanks were called \"Sherman Tulips\". The tanks fitted included both conventional Shermans and the more heavily armed Sherman Fireflies.\n\nThe modifications were first tried out by two officers of the 1st Armoured Battalion, Coldstream Guards, 5th Guards Armoured Brigade, who obtained rockets and launching rails from an RAF base and carried out the first test firings on 17 March 1945. They were inspired after hearing the idea had been earlier tried, but abandoned, by a Canadian unit, the 18th Armoured Car Regiment (12th Manitoba Dragoons), who had fitted RP-3 rails to a Staghound Armoured Car.\n\nWithin a week all the tanks of Number 2 Squadron had been fitted with launch rails, some tanks had two launching rails, others had four. The rails were at fixed elevations and the rockets had fixed ranges either .\n\nThe rockets were highly inaccurate when fired from a tank as they were being fired from a stationary point and had little slipstream over the fins. Despite this, the RP-3 was valued by tank crews for the destructive effect of its 60-pound warhead. In combat, they were also used for short-range, saturation bombardment of an area and were effective as an immediate counter to German ambushes.\n\n\nNames referred to complete weight of the warhead fitted to the rocket body.\n\nThese are aircraft that used the RP-3 operationally, a number of aircraft types were fitted with RP-3s on an experimental basis.\n\n\n\nThe 3-inch RP continued to be used on RAF and RN aircraft in the ground attack role until replaced by the SNEB podded rocket (RAF) and the 2-inch podded RP (RN).\n\n\nNotes\nCitations\n\n"}

It is the only dormouse native to the British Isles, and is therefore often referred to simply as the \"dormouse\" in British sources, although the edible dormouse, \"Glis glis\", has been accidentally introduced and now has an established population. Though Ireland has no native dormouse, the hazel dormouse has recently been found in County Kildare, and appears to be spreading rapidly, helped by the prevalence of hedgerows in the Irish countryside. The first record of the dormouse in Ireland was noted in Co. Kildare in 2010.\n\nThe United Kingdom distribution of the hazel dormouse can be found on the National Biodiversity Network website. A 2016 study finds that hazel dormice in Britain have declined by over one third since 2000. Woodland habitat loss and management and a warming climate are seen as material threats to their future status.\n\nAccording to English Nature's \"Dormouse Conservation Handbook\", hazel dormice are \"particularly associated with deciduous woodland\" but also inhabit hedgerows and scrub.\n\nDormice seldom travel more than 70 m from their nest.\n\nThe hazel dormouse can reach a body length of about and a length of about if you consider the tail as well. It is long with a tail of . It weighs , although this increases to just before hibernation. This small mammal has reddish brown fur that can vary up to golden-brown or yellow-orange-brown becoming lighter in the lower part. Eyes are large and black. Ears are small and not very developed, while the tail is long and completely covered with hair.\n\nIt is a nocturnal creature and spends most of its waking hours among the branches of trees looking for food. It will make long detours rather than come down to the ground and expose itself to danger. The hazel dormouse hibernates from October to April–May.\n\nIn winter (October to November), the hazel dormouse will hibernate in nests on the ground, in the base of old coppiced trees or hazel stools, under piles of leaves or under log piles as these situations are not subject to extreme variations in either temperature or humidity. Dormice are almost completely arboreal in habit but much less reluctant to cross open ground than was thought even recently. When it wakes up in spring (late April or early May), it builds woven nests of shredded honeysuckle bark, fresh leaves and grasses in the undergrowth. If the weather is cold and wet, and food scarce, it saves energy by going into torpor; it curls up into a ball and goes to sleep. The hazel dormouse, therefore, spends a large proportion of its life sleeping − either hibernating in winter or in torpor in summer.\nExamination of hazelnuts may show a neat, round hole in the shell. This indicates it has been opened by a small rodent, e.g., the dormouse, wood mouse, or bank vole. Other animals, such as squirrels or jays, will either split the shell completely in half or make a jagged hole in it.\n\nFurther examination reveals the cut surface of the hole has toothmarks which follow the direction of the shell. In addition, there will be toothmarks on the outer surface of the nut, at an angle of about 45 degrees to the cut surface. Woodmice and voles bite across the nutshell leaving clear parallel toothmarks from inside to outside. Woodmice also leave toothmarks on the outer surface of the nut but voles do not.\n\nThe hazel dormouse requires a variety of arboreal foods to survive. It eats berries and nuts and other fruit with hazelnuts being the main food for fattening up before hibernation. \nThe dormouse also eats hornbeam and blackthorn fruit where hazel is scarce. Other food sources are the buds of young leaves, and flowers which provide nectar and pollen. The dormouse also eats insects found on food-source trees, particularly aphids and caterpillars.\n\n\n\nThe hazel dormouse is protected by and in UK under the Wildlife and Countryside Act.\n\n"}

As of 2011, the town had a population of 38,355. Kilakarai is one of the Taluka in Ramanathapuram District.\n\nKilakarai is a coastal town and a port, located in the southern Tamil Nadu. It was a flourishing seaport and a gateway to places as far as Madurai until the early 20th century. The famous pearl belt known as the Gulf of Mannar in the Bay of Bengal is dotted with small islands Appa Tivu, Nallathanni Theevu, Shuli Tivu, Uppu Tanni Tivu, Talari Tivu and Musal Tivu. The coastal line of Kilakarai is formed by a series of small bays and finest coral reefs sheltering the town from the perils of the ocean. It was also called as \"Quilicare\", kirkari, Sembi Nadu, Korkai, Powthira Manicka Pattinam, \"Kelikkarai\", \"Ninathaan mudithaan pattinam\", \"Seppi Nadu\", \"lebbat pattan\" (pattan mentioned in voyages of Ibn Battuta & map displayed in Ibn Battuta Mall).\n\nThe prime occupations of the people were pearl, conch, sea trade and transport. The mid-20th century saw a decline in the occupations of the people of Kilakarai, with the advent of the surface transport the Merchant Navies faded away and Kilakarai aka Killikare ceased to be a harbour and port. The cultured pearl industry and the mindless dragnet fishing that destroyed the coral reefs, choked the once robust pearl trade or Muthu Salabam. The conch and coral industries declined due to new regulations and restrictions. Vattalappam is a famous dish during Eid and some special occasions\n\nKilakarai is renowned for its communal harmony. The majority of the population here is Muslim with people of other faith Hindu, Christians living together. The communal harmony that always existed is best exemplified by the famous Rameswaram Ramanathaswamy Temple and Jumma Pallivasal (Vallal Seethakathi is interred here) at Kilakarai, while the architecture is the same the workforce was provided by the erstwhile ruler Sethupathi of Ramnad and most of the materials for both the edifice were supplied by the Kilakarai merchant navies. The town is reminiscent of Spanish Moorish architecture and is located about 60 km south west of the temple town of Rameswaram.\n\nIt has the oldest mosque in India known as the kadakarai palli. It has a unique pre-Islamic heritage of more than 200 years. The Kilakarai Muslims or Kilakarai Moors form 80% of the population of Kilakarai. Ibnu Batutah once said in his travel notes \"it's the place where most Arab settlers live and he was surprised to see them living as in Arab land\".\n\nThe migration of the people after the decline of the marine trade and industry resulted in people exploring the other parts of the globe. Kilakarai has a large expatriate population and a high literacy rate. This has enabled the people of Kilakarai to span the globe and become active merchants in the Middle and Far East, US and European markets.\n\nHameedia Primary School was started as a Madrasa in the year 1870, and gradually became a Thinnai Palli and became a registered School in 1938 due to the efforts of K.T.M. Hussain Sahib, fondly known as Haajiaar. This school is completing its sesquicentennial year (150th year) in 2020. The Hameedia Primary School Alumni Association - (HPSAA) consists of great stalwarts of Kilakarai including the founders of ETA, Crescent, Sathak Group and more than 100 institutions and business enterprises worldwide.\n\nHPSAA is organising an Annual Reunion and Trade Fair annually on 25th & 26th of December, commencing its 150th year in 2019. Trade Fair and business summits, Job Fair, Free Medical Camp, Food Counters, Seminars and Talk shows for the benefit of the People of Kilakarai on a high note. Leading Brands, institutions, Business houses are expected to participate in this years edition.\nHameedia High School founded in 1940s beside the old Arabic Madrasa Aroosiya Thaika, was a catalyst to more graduates from Kilakarai. With the arrival of Mohamed Sathak Engineering College and then the Thassim Beevi Abdul Kader College for Women the number of graduates from this traditional town has seen a steady rise.\n\nKilakarai was constituted as a panchayat in the year 1885.

It marks the northern end of the main ridge of the Helvellyn range and is often walked as part of the ridge walk. The fell stands south of the village of Threlkeld and the A66 road, and it forms the steep eastern side of the tranquil valley of St John's in the Vale.\n\nOn its western side the fell displays a dark mass of rocky crags and a deep-set rocky ravine. On the other side it has smooth grassy slopes. Beneath the north face is the steep valley or clough from which Clough Head gets its name. Also beneath the steep northern face lies the lower hill of Threlkeld Knotts, a granite hill which has been much quarried round its margin.\n\nA number of different types of rock are found on and around Clough Head, which were formed in very different circumstances. These include deep-sea sedimentation, effusive volcanic lava flows, explosive volcanism, an intrusion of granite, mineralisation and finally glacial sculpting. To understand the geology of Clough Head is to understand much of the geology of the Lake District.\n\nAn old route known as the Old Coach Road passes beneath Clough Head. Most of the fell is Open Access land, which walkers can enter from either end of the Old Coach Road, or from a lane south of the village of Threlkeld. Four main routes lead to the summit.\n\nWith a height of 726 m, Clough Head is the lowest summit of the Helvellyn range.\n\nGentle grass-covered slopes on the south and east sides of the fell drop to a broad col and to Mosedale, both of which separate Clough Head from Great Dodd, its neighbour to the south. To the north of the summit the ground drops abruptly down a steep scree-covered and craggy slope which marks the northern end of the Helvellyn range. This face is called Red Screes from the colour of the rock.\n\nBeneath Red Screes is the lower, rounded, grassy hill of Threlkeld Knotts. This hill rises gently from the valley of the River Glenderamackin, which separates the Helvellyn range of fells from Blencathra and the northern Lakeland fells. A steep valley to the east of Threlkeld Knotts, which begins immediately below Red Screes, is the clough from which Clough Head is named. In the bottom of this valley there is a sheepfold known as Clough Fold.\nSteep rocky crags guard the whole western side of the fell, rising abruptly from the green valley of St John's in the Vale. This western face of Clough Head, is steep, rough and rocky. The principal rock features are, from north to south: Buck Castle, Wanthwaite Crags and Bram Crag. South of Wanthwaite Crags is the very steep Fisher's Wife's Rake, a grassy break in the cliffs (though with scree) which allows determined fell-walkers to ascend the fell on this side. North of Bram Crag is a deep-seated rocky ravine called Sandbed Gill. This gill contains a considerable flow of water in its rocky gorge, but it often has only a dry bed by the time it gets down to valley level.\n\nNorth-east of the summit of Clough Head is the lesser top of White Pike. From here the ridge descends and gradually broadens into the rough expanse of Thelkeld Common.\n\nThe western slopes of Clough Head drain into St John's Beck, which flows north into the River Greta, and which in turn joins the River Derwent at Keswick. The southern and eastern slopes drain into Mosedale and Mosedale Beck, which also joins the River Greta, via the River Glenderamackin.\n\nThrelkeld Knotts ( \"the knobbly hill above Threlkeld\") is a lower, rounded hill, nestling against and overshadowed by the steep northern face of Clough Head. Its curving summit ridge contains three small tops, each of which is marked by a cairn. From Threlkeld Knotts there is a striking view of Red Screes just above, and a narrow path slants up through the crags to the west shoulder of Clough Head.\n\nOn the northern slope of Threlkeld Knotts, not far above the large quarry, are the remains of an Iron Age settlement. The documented remains include seven hut circles, five enclosures, two trackways, a field system, and some fifty cairns which probably represent field clearances. Remains of enclosure walls may still be seen, about 200 m north of the Old Coach Road.\n\nAn old route, marked on maps as \"Old Coach Road\" crosses the northern slopes of Threlkeld Knotts and skirts the eastern side of Clough Head, reaching a height of 437 m as it crosses from Wanthwaite () in St John's in the Vale to High Row near Dockray. This has suffered from rain water erosion in recent years, but remains a useful track for walkers. Near the summit of the road is Hause Well, a spring issuing from a crevice in the rock. The Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 map shows the road as an \"other route with public access\" and as a \"traffic-free cycle route;\" it does not show it as either a \"byway\" or a \"restricted byway\". However, official signs present on the gates at both ends of the road clearly show that access by motorised vehicles is permitted.\n\nThe whole of Clough Head, Threlkeld Knotts and Threlkeld Common (above the wall which encloses the lower agricultural land and Threlkeld Quarry) is Open Access land. Entry to this land can be had from three points: from either end of the Old Coach Road, or from the lane leading to Newsham Farm. This lane begins opposite Threlkeld village, or it can be joined from the disused railway line alongside the road to the quarry.\n\nWalkers may approach the summit by means of four principal routes. A narrow footpath leads from the Old Coach Road (at a point 250 m east of Hause Well) to White Pike and then on to the summit.\n\nAnother narrow path leads from Threlkeld Knotts, slanting up through the crags and scree of Red Screes to emerge on the west shoulder of Clough Head. From there one may go up gentle grassy slopes to the summit, although the main path contours round to meet the track coming up from Great Dodd, which suggests that many ridge-walkers bypass the top (just as the ridge path bypasses nearly all the other tops of the range.)\n\nFrom the south, the ridge track from Great Dodd leads straight up the long gentle slope to the top.\n\nFinally, Fisher's Wife's Rake is a possible route up through the crags on the west side of Clough Head for energetic and determined walkers, but it is \"\"very\" steep.\"\n\nClimbers, or scramblers with some rock-climbing experience and a rope for the more difficult pitches, can ascend the hidden recesses of Sandbed Gill. Sandbed Gill was the first new route in the Lake District to be pioneered by the brothers George and Ashley Abraham in 1890. Although George was only 18 at the time, and Ashley 14, they had already gained true rock-climbing skills elsewhere in the Lakes. Walkers should leave the gill well alone.\n\nClough Head is often included as the first (or last) step of a traverse of the Helvellyn range. It may also be included in a longer version of the horseshoe walk around Deepdale which takes in the three \"Dodds\" to its south. This walk begins at High Row and takes advantage of the Old Coach Road.\n\nThe summit is marked by an Ordnance Survey triangulation column and a wind shelter. It provides a good view of Blencathra to the north, and a wide, all-round view, broken only by Great Dodd, with glimpses of both the Solway Firth to the north and Morecambe Bay to the south. To the south-west the vista of the high fells is \"especially striking\".\n\nAlfred Wainwright included a drawing of himself regarding Blencathra from this viewpoint in his \"Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells\". Mark Richards recommends White Pike as a better place for contemplating the view.\n\nThe rocks of Clough Head belong to both the Skiddaw Group and the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, both of which date from the Ordovician period.\n\nAn east-west geological fault just north of the summit has brought these two rather different rock groups side by side. To the north, including White Pike, much of Threlkeld Common and the margins of Threlkeld Knotts are rocks of the Buttermere Formation, part of the Skiddaw Group. Mudstones, siltstones and sandstones which had been deposited in deep water on the northern margin of an ancient continent (Avalonia) in the early Ordovician Period were chaotically disrupted by a huge undersea avalanche to form an olistostrome deposit in which blocks of rock are now embedded in a matrix of mudstone, and intensely deformed by minor folds, slumps and shears. This event can be dated to about 460 million years ago.\n\nThe deep sea deposits of the Skiddaw Group were raised above sea level by the subduction of ocean crust from the north beneath the continent to the south. This uplift was followed by a brief (about 5 million years) period of intense volcanic activity, up to about 450 million years ago.\n\nTo the south of the fault on Clough Head are rocks of the Birker Fell Andesite Formation. These rocks are among the earliest of the volcanic rocks of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, and are part of a thick succession of andesite sheets which now outcrop in a wide band around the western and northern sides of the Lake District. These sheets were formed by successive eruptions of mobile andesitic lava from shallow-sided volcanoes. The composition of the erupting magma varied from time to time, and the geological map shows an area of basaltic andesite along the crags on the western side of the fell, and areas of dacite higher on the fell. Individual lava flows may be separated by beds of volcaniclastic sandstone, that is, sedimentary deposits formed from the erosion of the volcanic rocks and deposited by streams, floods and possibly wind. The geological map shows a number of areas of volcaniclastic sandstone on the crags on the west side, as well as a larger area surrounding the summit, into which an andesite sill was intruded.\n\nAfter the eruptions of the Birker Fell Formation, the composition of the erupting magma changed from largely andesitic to predominantly dacitic, and as a result the nature of the volcanism became more explosive.\n\nIn the area to the north of Sticks Pass the Birker Fell andesites are overlain by the Lincomb Tarns Tuff Formation. This formation is one of the most widespread of the volcanic rocks of the Lake District; it seems that the whole district was buried beneath at least 150 m of densely welded ignimbrite, a rock formed from a pyroclastic flow of very hot gas and rock. This formation must represent a series of eruptions of truly exceptional magnitude, accompanying the formation of a volcanic caldera probably in the area around what is now Helvellyn.\n\nOn Clough Head a small sheet of the Thirlmere Tuff Member covers the summit of the fell, a member of the Lincomb Tarns Formation. This rock is a rhyolitic lapilli-tuff in which the individual pieces of semi-molten lava were flattened under the weight of deposits above them.\n\nTowards the end of, or after the cessation of the volcanic activity a large granite batholith was emplaced in stages beneath the volcanic rocks of the Lake District. Threlkeld Knotts consists largely of an intrusion of micro-granite, known as the Threlkeld Intrusion, a part of the larger batholith. The granite was intruded into rocks of the Skiddaw Group and the base of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group. Uranium-lead dating has established an age of 451±1.1 million years for this intrusion.\n\nSeven quarries around the western side of Threlkeld Knotts have worked the microgranite. In addition to the large Threlkeld Quarry there are smaller workings at Birkett Bank, Hilltop Quarries and Bramcrag Quarry. Threlkeld Quarry was opened in 1870 to supply railway ballast for the Crewe to Carlisle railway line. Production increased in the 1890s with material for Thirlmere Reservoir and for roadstone. The quarry closed in the 1980s and now houses the Threlkeld Quarry and Mining Museum.\n\nMineral veins have been formed in many Lake District rocks by hydrothermal circulation of groundwater though geological faults and are often associated with the granite batholith. Veins containing lead and copper ores were found on Wanthwaite Crag where there are several old mineral workings, some very old. The most recent lease was taken out in 1887 by the short-lived and unsuccessful Wanthwaite Crag Mining Company.\n\nThe lower promontory of Threlkeld Knotts north of Clough Head is scarred and flanked by 'rock slope failure' fractures and landslips, and views from the A66 and Blencathra could suggest that the whole mass of the Knotts has descended from the concavity in the north face, which is not a true glacial cirque (Lakeland combe), but this remains debatable . Rock slope failure also patterns White Pike with antiscarps (uphill-facing scarplets), which could formerly have extended across the Clough Head cavity.\n\nClough Head was called \"Threlkeld Fell\" in Thomas West's 1778 guide book. Its present name, Clough Head, was first recorded by the Ordnance Survey in 1867. Clough is a dialect word from the Old English \"clōh\", a ravine. This appears to be a reference to a steep valley just below Red Screes, and which contains a sheepfold called Clough Fold. Thus Clough Head is \"the hill-top above the ravine.\"\n\nWhite Pike is \"the pale summit,\" recorded since 1774, probably named from its pale-coloured rock, and perhaps in contrast to the reddish colour of Red Screes beneath the main summit.\n\nThrelkeld Knotts was first recorded by the Ordnance Survey in 1900. Knott is a dialect word from the Old Norse \"knǫttr\", 'ball, hard round mass' used of compact or craggy hills. Hence Threlkeld Knotts is \"the knobbly hill above Threlkeld\", a place-name recorded from as early as 1197 and meaning \"the slaves' spring\" from the Old Norse \"þræla\", 'thrall, slave,' and Old Norse \"kelda\", 'a spring.' 'Thrall' may have been the word used by the Norse settlers to refer to the native Britons.\n\nFisher's Wife's Rake is \"Mrs Fisher's Path.\" Rake is a dialect word of unknown origin which refers to a narrow path on a hill. Mark Richards claims that the name comes from the Fisher family of Rake How across the valley. He says the husband cut peat on the col above and his wife hauled it down by sled, but he gives no indication of the source of this information.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n"}

{"id": "2225407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2225407", "title": "Extras (TV series)", "text": "Extras (TV series)\n\nExtras is a British sitcom about extras working in television, film, and theatre. The series was co-produced by the BBC and HBO and was created, written, and directed by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, both of whom also starred in it. \"Extras\" follows the lives of Andy Millman (Gervais), his platonic friend Maggie Jacobs (Ashley Jensen), and Andy's substandard agent and part-time retail employee Darren Lamb (Merchant) as Millman muddles through life as an anonymous \"background performer\" who eventually finds success as a B-level sitcom star.\n\n\"Extras\" has two series of six episodes each as well as a Christmas Special. The first episode aired in the UK on 21 July 2005 on BBC Two and on 25 September 2005 on HBO in the US. The second series premiered in the UK on BBC Two on 14 September 2006 and began airing in the US on HBO and in Australia on ABC on 14 February 2007. The Christmas Special aired on 27 December 2007 on BBC One and on 16 December 2007 on HBO. Both series are available on DVD and, at various times, through streaming services in the UK and the US.\n\nThe series is filmed in a more traditional sitcom style than the mockumentary style used by Gervais and Merchant in their previous series \"The Office\". Each episode has at least one guest star: a television or film celebrity, who play what Gervais and Merchant have referred to as \"twisted\" versions of themselves; an exaggerated or inverted parody of their public personas.\n\nThe show has been critically acclaimed, and has a Metacritic score of 81/100.\n\n\nAndy Millman (Ricky Gervais) is an aspiring actor who can only find work as an extra which he calls being a \"background artist\" as a means of making the work seem more dignified. Andy is accompanied on his various projects by his platonic best friend and fellow extra, Maggie Jacobs (Ashley Jensen). Maggie is well-meaning but ditzy, often missing obvious social cues and failing to exhibit appropriate tact and subtlety in conversations. Unlike Andy, Maggie has no aspirations toward being anything more than an extra. Andy's agent, Darren Lamb (Stephen Merchant) has no real experience in the field of entertainment. He is incompetent, often taking no steps at all to find work for Andy, and even discouraging potential employers from hiring his client due to his flabby physique, age, and lack of acting experience. Darren is assisted by former soap opera star Shaun Williamson, who plays himself. Lamb frequently tries to undermine Andy by suggesting Williamson (who Lamb refers to by his former \"EastEnders\" character name, \"Barry\") is better suited for various acting roles that are offered to Andy.\n\nFed up with life as an extra who is always being cut out of scenes just as he manages to get his face on camera, Andy shamelessly kisses up to celebrities and producers in an effort to try to get screen time or a line of dialogue. Although often successful in these endeavours, circumstances always arise that prevent Andy from advancing his career. Reasons include celebrities confessing that they have no real power to help, or (more often) Andy inadvertently offending the star which results in his immediate dismissal from the set. In the conclusion of season one, Andy delivers a sitcom script he has written to Patrick Stewart who, in turn, passes it along to the BBC through his production company. Andy gets a meeting with BBC comedy producers who greenlight his project and agree to allow him to play the starring role in the show.\n\nSeries Two largely chronicles Andy's frustrations with his sitcom--\"When the Whistle Blows\"—which is heavily rewritten by BBC producers resulting in it being a lowest-common-denominator comedy that relies on a multitude of catchphrases, offensive stereotypes and silly costumes for cheap laughs. Although the sitcom is commercially successful, pulling six million weekly viewers, it is a flop with critics who mercilessly bash both it and Andy. Andy periodically gets a chance to expand his repertoire in film and on stage but manages to ruin every opportunity that comes his way by either refusing to take direction, or by once again offending bigger stars than himself.\n\nIn the series' 90-minute finale, the sitcom has made Andy financially successful and recognisable to many but he is increasingly frustrated with the show's quality and with his career not moving forward. Andy is convinced to fire Darren as his agent and become a client of a larger, more professional firm which he believes will accelerate his path upward. After taping a Christmas Special for \"When the Whistle Blows\", he announces to the live studio audience that he is quitting the series effective immediately. His career falls into total stagnation and Andy is forced to take bit parts on various long-running British television series such as \"Doctor Who\" and \"Hotel Babylon\". Eventually, his agent ceases to take his calls. Andy's relationship with Maggie sours as he frequently ignores her and spends all of the time they spend together complaining about not getting the opportunities he feels he deserves.\n\nWhen he crashes his agent's lunch meeting at a posh restaurant, he is bluntly told that he will never realise his dreams of having fame, fortune, prestige and respect. Crushed, Andy reluctantly agrees to lower his expectations for the sake of remaining modestly famous and successful and is cast in \"Celebrity Big Brother\". While staying in the \"Celebrity Big Brother\" house, Andy openly reflects upon the price of fame and grows increasingly disenchanted with the culture of celebrity worship that has manifested itself throughout Western society.\n\nHis despondency culminates in an emotional breakdown during a conversation with the other housemates. He tearfully turns to the camera and apologises to Maggie, who is watching the broadcast from her flat, for ignoring her and not heeding her advice to be grateful for the things he has managed to achieve. He voluntarily departs the house, ending his tenure on the show. Moved by the unexpected outpouring of emotion, a group of journalists eagerly awaits Andy's appearance at a press conference. Andy's agent returns and tells him that his emotional turn has instantly skyrocketed Andy's profile and that a number of A-list stars are requesting to meet him. As his agent prepares to introduce him to the throng of waiting press, Andy quietly slips out the back door of the studio where Maggie is waiting for him in her car. They drive off together with Andy seemingly turning his back on show business and accepting a life of anonymity.\n\nThere are twelve regular episodes and a 90-minute Christmas special.\n\nWhen the first series was originally broadcast in the UK, the episode featuring Ben Stiller was broadcast first, followed by the Ross Kemp and Vinnie Jones episode the following week. When the series was repeated over the Christmas holiday 2005, the episodes were returned to their intended order, with Ross Kemp first, followed by Stiller. The first series DVD, released in the UK on 31 October 2005, also preserves this same order, along with the \"Extras\" script book.\n\nWhen the first series was shown in North America, another order was used:\n\n\nThere were some subtle changes between the UK and US versions, with references to the names of British celebrities often being changed to American celebrities for the US edition.\n\nIn series 2, episode 1, Keith Chegwin's anti-gay tirade includes the sentence \"Men have knobs, women have fannies. Pop knob in fanny. Not up the arse.\" In British English \"fanny\" is a euphemism for vagina, while in American English \"fanny\" is a term for buttocks. A scene was shot, and aired in the US, in which Chegwin says \"Men have dicks. Women have vaginas. Pop dick in vagina. Not up the bum.\"\n\nIn series 2, episode 3, in the scene where Darren Lamb tells Andy Millman about an offer that has come in for Andy to play a supporting role in a film, Lamb mistakenly says the film stars Billie Piper. For the American broadcast, an alternative take was used where Merchant's character says, \"How do you fancy three days with Halle Berry?\" In each case, Piper and Berry's names are mistaken for the name Harry Potter (actor Daniel Radcliffe guest stars in the episode).\n\nIn series 2, episode 4, a scene featuring UK TV presenter Moira Stuart was completely excised from the US version and a song by Coldplay frontman Chris Martin replaced it; the latter was featured as a deleted scene on the DVD releases.\n\nIn the Christmas special the talking \"Jade Goody\" doll was replaced by a talking \"Kramer\" doll. (Both dolls parodied incidents where each celebrity said things publicly that were generally seen as racist.) The T-shirt in the studio audience depicting Victoria Wood and Asda is replaced in the US version by a T-shirt depicting Sigourney Weaver and DirectTV. A scene with George Michael was also truncated to remove references to UK celebrities Richard and Judy and Catherine Tate. A scene set in the Carphone Warehouse was edited to remove jokes referring to the long running BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\".\n\n\"When the Whistle Blows\" is the show-within-a-show sitcom created, co-written by and starring Andy Millman. It was first mentioned in episode 1.3, as a script that Millman had written and given to Darren, who neglected to read it (in a recurring joke, he would frequently forget the name of the show, often calling it \"When the Wind Blows\" and even confusing it with \"The Wind in the Willows\"). The script was turned into a sitcom on BBC One in the first-season finale, after Millman gave the script to Patrick Stewart. Excerpts from the sitcom are featured in the second season, and many of the \"Extras\" second season plotlines revolve around Millman's experiences on and around the show.\n\n\"When the Whistle Blows\" is set in a Wigan factory canteen. The humour is broad and lowbrow in the manner of many catchphrase-based sitcoms. The main catchphrase of the show, \"Are you 'avin' a laugh?\" is spoken by Millman. The show is unpopular with critics but popular with the public. It does receive a BAFTA nomination, although Millman suspects it is there simply to make up the numbers, and in the end it loses to an unspecified programme by Stephen Fry.\n\nMillman is deeply unhappy with the show, feeling that too many people have interfered with his original ideas in the hunt for ratings. It appears that Millman originally set out to do a comedy similar to \"The Office\", with true-to-life characters in a realistic work environment, without a studio audience or canned laughter. After being forced to collaborate and compromise many of his ideas with producers at the BBC, the show is transformed into lowest common denominator fare with each character having his/her own catchphrase which are repeated ad nauseam to the delight of its 6 million viewers. The show is further debased by the unexplained guest appearance of Coldplay's Chris Martin, in episode 2.4, which bears no relation to the plot and which Millman openly opposes, going so far as to utter the on-camera line, \"Chris Martin, what are you doing in a factory in Wigan? It's mental!\"\n\nThe presence of studio audiences, canned laughter, and the reliance on funny wigs, costumes and catchphrases for humour is a comment on British comedy hits such as \"Little Britain\" and \"The League of Gentlemen\". Many people that Millman sees at the recording of the pilot wear T-shirts displaying comedy catchphrases, such as \"Wassup\", \"It's Chico Time\", \"I'm a lady!\", \"Am I bovvered?\" and \"Garlic bread?.\" (These shirts are not shown in the US version of \"Extras\".) Some of the reviews that the show gets refer to it as a \"time warp comedy\", and Millman's character talks about 1970s catchphrases such as Mr Humphreys' \"I'm Free\" (from \"Are You Being Served?\") and Frank Spencer's \"Ooh Betty\" (from \"Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em\"), suggesting that it is also partly sending up 1970s British comedy. In episode 2.5, Germaine Greer suggests that \"When the Whistle Blows\" is \"sub \"Carry On\"\".\n\nThe closing title track is called \"Tea for the Tillerman\", which is written and performed by Cat Stevens and is the title track of his album \"Tea for the Tillerman\". The fourth episode of the second series of the show features a cover of the song performed by Chris Martin of Coldplay.\n\nThe song in the Christmas Special highlighting Maggie's depression after she hits bottom and quits acting is \"This Woman's Work\" by Kate Bush. When Andy is having a bad time at The Ivy restaurant and leaves Maggie on her own, The Smiths' song \"Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want\" can be heard.\n\nAccording to a segment in the extras section of the Series 1 DVD, Jude Law was scheduled to appear in one of the episodes, after meeting Gervais backstage on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\", but had to pull out due to film commitments. This resulted in Gervais and Merchant having to scramble to find a replacement actor at the last minute, with Leonardo DiCaprio being considered and doggedly pursued. A featurette on the first series DVD release, \"Finding Leo\", consists of late-night video camera footage (shot mostly by Merchant) chronicling Gervais' desperate but ultimately unsuccessful attempts to contact DiCaprio's representatives. Law was ultimately replaced by Patrick Stewart in the series 1 finale, although a poster for the Jude Law film \"Alfie\" appeared at the end. Other actors who did not appear in \"Extras\" despite initial reports from Gervais that they would appear include Madonna, Brad Pitt, and Tom Cruise. Keith Harris turned down a part having read the script, telling \"The Independent\" \"This isn't clever writing, it's pure filth\".\n\nOverall, \"Extras\" has been received very well by critics in the UK. The show received 3 BAFTA Award nominations in 2006 including Best Comedy Performance for Ashley Jensen, Best Writer for Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, and Best Situation Comedy. In 2007, both Gervais and Merchant were nominated, separately, for Best Comedy Performance, with Gervais ultimately winning the award.\n\nThe show has also received accolades in the US. In 2006, the show received four nominations at the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards. Ben Stiller and Patrick Stewart received nominations for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series and both lost to Leslie Jordan on \"Will & Grace\". Kate Winslet received a nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series and lost to Cloris Leachman for \"Malcolm in the Middle\". Gervais and Merchant were also nominated for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for the episode with Kate Winslet. They lost to Greg Garcia for writing the pilot episode of \"My Name Is Earl\".\n\nIn 2007, the show received four nominations at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards. Gervais was nominated for and won Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, and Ian McKellen was nominated for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series. Gervais and Merchant were also nominated for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series for Daniel Radcliffe and Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series for Orlando Bloom. \"Extras\" made the Top 10 list of Outstanding Comedy Series but was not nominated in the Top 5.\n\nIn 2008, the finale earned five nominations at the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards. The special was nominated for Outstanding Made for Television Movie, losing out to \"Recount\". On the acting side, Gervais was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie, losing to Paul Giamatti in \"John Adams\", while Jensen received her first Emmy nomination with a nod in the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or Movie category. She lost out to Eileen Atkins in \"Cranford\". Gervais and Merchant received nominations for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie, or Dramatic Special, as well as in the Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries, Movie, or Dramatic Special category, but lost the former to Jay Roach for \"Recount\" and the latter to Kirk Ellis for \"John Adams\".\n\n"}

AMOLF carries out fundamental research on the physics and design principles of natural and man-made complex matter. AMOLF uses these insights to create novel functional materials and find new solutions to societal challenges in renewable energy, green ICT and healthcare. AMOLF is located at the Amsterdam Science Park.\n\nAMOLF used to be part of the Dutch Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter (FOM). On 31 December 2016 FOM integrated in NWO.\n\nThe institute was established in 1949 by the government as the FOM Laboratory for Mass Spectrography. In 1960, it was renamed to Laboratory for Mass Separation, and in 1966 it was reorganized into a research institute and renamed FOM Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics (AMOLF).\n\nThe original research goal was to demonstrate the separation of uranium isotopes by electromagnetic separation methods, a topic of great strategic importance after World War II. To reach this goal, a number of novelanalytical instrumentation were developed, starting with the development of mass-spectrometric tools. In 1953 AMOLF was the first European institute to successfully enrich Uranium. Soon after, research on thermal diffusion in gases followed, as did ultracentrifuge concepts, cathode dispersion, excitation of gases by using energetic ions and research on molecular beams. The gas-ultracentrifuge developed at AMOLF (under ) provided a base for the commercial enrichment of Uranium at the today well-known company of URENCO in Almelo.\n\nAMOLF functions as an incubator for Dutch science, both in terms of launching new research themes and in terms of training talented scientists. AMOLF is headed by its director Huib Bakker, who succeeded on 1 February 2016. The organization has 19 research groups headed by tenured or tenure-track group leaders. AMOLF employs about 130 researchers and 70 employees for technical and administrative support.\n\nAMOLF’s research program consists of four intertwined themes.\n\n\nAMOLF publishes each year on average 15 PhD theses and over 120 papers.\n\n\n"}

According to myth, the Sirins lived in Vyraj or around the Euphrates River.\n\nThese half-women half-birds are directly based on the Greek myths and later folklore about sirens. They were usually portrayed wearing a crown or with a nimbus. Sirins sang beautiful songs to the saints, foretelling future joys. For mortals, however, the birds were dangerous. Men who heard them would forget everything on earth, follow them, and ultimately die. People would attempt to save themselves from Sirins by shooting cannons, ringing bells and making other loud noises to scare the bird off. Later (17-18th century), the image of Sirins changed and they started to symbolize world harmony (as they live near paradise). People in those times believed only happy people could hear a Sirin, while only very few could see one because she is as fast and difficult to catch as human happiness. She symbolizes eternal joy and heavenly happiness.\n\nThe legend of Sirin might have been introduced to Rus' by Persian merchants in the 8th-9th century. In the cities of Chersonesos and Kiev they are often found on pottery, golden pendants, even on the borders of Gospel books of tenth-twelfth centuries. Furthermore, Sirin is connected to the Greek Siren. Due to the history, the Russian culture has experienced a very strong correlation with Greek culture and Byzantine Empire through its steppes, the Volga river and Dniepr river. Pomors often depicted Sirins on the illustrations in the Book of Genesis as birds sitting in paradise trees.\n\nSometimes Sirins are seen as a metaphor for God's word going into the soul of a man. Sometimes they are seen as a metaphor of heretics tempting the weak. Sometimes Sirins were considered equivalent to the Polish Wila. In Russian folklore, Sirin was mixed with the revered religious writer Saint Ephrem the Syrian. Thus, peasant lyrists such as Nikolay Klyuev often used Sirins as a synonym for poet.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2225515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2225515", "title": "Turkish grammar", "text": "Turkish grammar\n\nTurkish grammar, as described in this article, is the grammar of standard Turkish as spoken and written by educated people in the Republic of Turkey.\n\nTurkish is a highly agglutinative language, in that much of the grammar is expressed by means of suffixes added to nouns and verbs. It is very regular compared with many European languages. For example, \"evlerden\" \"from the houses\" can be analysed as \"ev\" \"house\", \"-ler\" (plural suffix), \"-den\" (ablative case, meaning \"from\"); \"gidiyorum\" \"I am going\" as \"git\" \"go\", \"-iyor\" (present continuous tense), \"-um\" (1st person singular = \"I\"). \n\nAnother characteristic of Turkish is vowel harmony. Most suffixes have two or four different forms, the choice between which depends on the vowel of the word's root or the preceding suffix: for example, the ablative case of \"evler\" is \"evlerden\" \"from the houses\" but, the ablative case of \"başlar\" \"heads\" is \"başlardan\" \"from the heads\". \n\nVerbs have six grammatical persons (three singular and three plural), various voices (active and passive, reflexive, reciprocal, and causative), and a large number of grammatical tenses. Meanings such as \"not\", \"be able\", \"must\" and \"if\", which are expressed as separate words in most European languages, are usually expressed with verbal suffixes in Turkish. A characteristic of Turkish which is shared by neighboring languages such as Bulgarian and Persian is that the perfect tense suffix (in Turkish \"-miş-\", \"-müş-\", \"-mış-\", or \"-muş-\") often has an inferential meaning, e.g. \"geliyormuşum\" \"it would seem (they say) that I am coming\".\n\nVerbs also have a number of participial forms, which Turkish makes much use of. Clauses which begin with \"who\" or \"because\" in English are generally translated by means of participial phrases in Turkish.\n\nIn Turkish, verbs generally come at the end of the sentence or clause; adjectives and possessive nouns come before the noun they describe; and meanings such as \"behind\", \"for\", \"like/similar to\" etc. are expressed as postpositions following the noun rather than prepositions before it.\n\nA suffix (\"ek\") is attached to a stem (\"gövde\"). A stem may be a root (\"kök\") or further analyzable. The suffixes used in Turkish fall roughly into two classes: constructive suffixes (\"yapım ekleri\") and inflectional suffixes (\"çekim ekleri\"). A constructive suffix makes a new word from an old one, that is, it is a derivational suffix. An inflectional suffix indicates how a word is used in a sentence. The article on Turkish grammar pertains chiefly to inflectional suffixes. The article on Turkish vocabulary treats the constructive suffixes.\n\nThe vowels of suffixes undergo vowel harmony. When a suffix is attached to a stem, the vowel in the suffix generally agrees in frontness or backness and in roundedness with the last vowel in the stem or of the preceding suffix.\n\nSome suffixes show two-way vowel harmony between \"e\" and \"a\", for example the plural suffix \"-ler/-lar\". The \"e\" form is found after a syllable with \"i\", \"e\", \"ö\" or \"ü\" (e.g. \"evler\" \"houses\", \"günler\" \"days\"), and also after certain Arabic or French borrowings such as \"saatler\" \"hours, clocks\", \"kalpler\" \"hearts\". Other suffixes show four-way vowel harmony between \"i\", \"ı\", \"u\", \"ü\", for example the possessive ending \"-im/-ım/-um/-üm\" \"my\". These endings are found after syllables containing their own vowels or after \"e\", \"a\", \"o\", \"ö\" respectively (e.g. \"evim\" \"my house\", \"gözüm\" \"my eye\", etc.)\n\nA Turkish suffix can be called \"enclitic\" if its vowel undergoes vowel harmony, agreeing with the last vowel of the stem the suffix is attached to.\n\nTurkish is a gender-neutral language except for a few sex-specific compound words (mostly naming professions). The English third-person singular pronouns \"she\", \"he\", and \"it\" all correspond to a single Turkish pronoun, \"o\". Since many given names in Turkish are also gender-neutral, it is possible to describe someone without their sex being made known.\n\nTurkish has a strong T–V distinction, using the second-person plural as the formal form, as in French and many other languages.\n\nTurkish also uses various honorifics.\n\nFamily members and friends speak to one another using the second singular person \"sen\", and adults use \"sen\" to address minors. In formal situations (meeting people for the first time, business, customer-clerk, colleagues) plural second-person \"siz\" is used almost exclusively. In very formal situations, double plural second-person \"sizler\" may refer to a much-respected person. Rarely, third-person plural conjugation of the verb (but not the pronoun) may be used to emphasize utmost respect. In the imperative, there are three forms: second person singular for informal, second person plural for formal, and double plural second person for very formal situations. Thus, the imperative forms of the verb \"gelmek\", \"to come\", are \"gel\" (second person singular, informal), \"gelin\" (second person plural, formal), and \"geliniz\" (double second-person plural, very formal). The very formal forms are not frequently used.\n\nTurkish honorifics generally follow the first name, especially if they refer to gender or particular social statuses (e.g. <name> Bey (Mr.), <name> Hanım (Ms.), <name> Hoca (teacher)). Such honorifics are used both in formal and informal situations. A newer honorific is \"Sayın,\" which precedes the surname or full name, and is not gender-specific. (e.g. Sayın Name Surname, or Sayın Surname, or Sayın Name Bey/Hanım). They are generally used in very formal situations. While these honorifics are normally used in pre-position to Turkish first names, for foreigners, names are preceded by \"Bay\" (Mr.) or \"Bayan\" (Ms.): Bay [Fox] Mulder, Bayan [Dana] Scully (cf. Fox [Mulder] Bey, Dana [Scully] Hanım, if these names were Turkish).\n\nIn the Turkish terms for the constructive and inflectional endings, three roots are involved:\nFor the last two verbal roots, the constructive suffix \"-im\" can be added to form nouns for instances of the actions denoted by the roots:\nEither of these nouns can be compounded with the noun \"ek\", resulting in an indefinite compound (\"belirtisiz tamlama\"), the sign of which is the inflectional suffix \"-i\" attached to \"ek\":\nThe inflectional suffix \"-ler\" comes before the \"-i\" to form the plural, so \"yapım ekleri, çekim ekleri\".\n\nMany words in Turkish— particularly many grammatical terms— are neologisms invented to replace earlier words borrowed from Arabic or Persian, which have largely been successful at permanently superseding the previously-used foreign terms. (See the main article on Turkish language.) In some cases, the foreign term continues to be in use alongside the neologism.\n\nThere are nine parts of speech (\"söz türleri\" \"word-kinds\") in Turkish.\nPostpositions are analogous to prepositions in English, the main difference being that they follow their objects. Postpositions can be considered particles, but there are particles in Turkish that are not postpositions.\n\nOnly nouns, pronouns and verbs are inflected in Turkish. An adjective can usually be treated as a noun or pronoun, in which case it can also be inflected. Inflection can give a noun features of a verb such as person and tense. With inflection, a verb can become one of the following:\nThese have peculiarities not shared with other nouns, adjectives or adverbs. \nFor example, some participles take a \"person\" the way verbs do.\nAlso, a verbal noun or adverb can take a direct object. \nSome verbal nouns are \"not\" inflected forms in Turkish but are borrowed from Arabic or other languages.\n\nIn Turkish, an ascriptive clause can be composed of a common noun standing alone as the Predicative, both the Subject and the Predicator being implicit and assumed from the situation. Example:\nThis means that both a noun and a verb can alone constitute an affirmative clause in Turkish, which is not the case in English.\n\nThere are two standards for listing verbs in dictionaries. Most dictionaries follow the tradition of spelling out the infinitive form of the verb as the headword of the entry, but others such as the Redhouse Turkish-English Dictionary are more technical and spell out the stem of the verb instead, that is, they spell out a string of letters that is useful for producing all other verb forms through morphological rules. Similar to the latter, this article follows the stem-as-citeword standard.\n\nIn Turkish, the verbal stem is also the second-person singular imperative form. Example:\n\nMany verbs are formed from nouns by addition of \"-le\". For example:\n\nThe aorist tense of a verb is formed by adding \"-(i/e)r\". The plural of a noun is formed by suffixing \"-ler\".\nHence, the suffix \"-ler\" can indicate either a plural noun or a finite verb: \n\nMost adjectives can be treated as nouns or pronouns. For example, \"genç\" can mean \"young\", \"young person\", or \"the young person being referred to\".\n\nAn adjective or noun can stand, as a modifier, before a noun. If the modifier is a noun (but not a noun of material), then the second noun word takes the inflectional suffix \"-i\":\n\nComparison of adjectives is not done by inflecting adjectives or adverbs, but by other means (described below).\n\nAdjectives can serve as adverbs, sometimes by means of repetition: \n\nA general rule of Turkish word order is that the modifier precedes the modified:\n\nAlthough the most common order of Turkish transitive sentences is subject–object–verb (SOV), all six permutations are valid (the subject and object are distinguished by case suffixes). The word order serves to express the theme and focus (rheme) of the sentence. The sentence initial portion is associated with the topic, the position just before the verb is used for the focus, and the post verbal position is used for background or clarifying information \n\nThe following sentences illustrate how Subject-Object-Verb order changes the meaning. In the English translations given here, the focus of the sentence is given in all capitals, while the background information (known from earlier in the discourse) is given in parenthesis.\n\nMeanings may be different depending on emphasis.\n\nIn one study, only about half of the transitive sentences used by a sample of Turkish speakers were found to be in the SOV order.\n\nWhen a sentence has a multiple informational components, the stressed component is positioned just before the verb:\n\nThe order of morphemes in Turkish is often opposite to English:\n\nThe above example is also illustrative of the productive nature of Turkish suffixes in creating new verbs, nouns, etc. Note that the word \"Avrupalılaştıramadık\" can be a verb, a participle, or a noun; In this parse, it is a participle, or verbal adjective, that is used as a noun.\n\nThe longest published word in Turkish, \"muvaffakiyetsizleştiricileştiriveremeyebileceklerimizdenmişsinizcesine\", means \"as if you are one of those that we cannot easily convert into an unsuccessful-person-maker\" (i.e., someone who un-educates people to make them unsuccessful).\n\nThe plural suffix (\"çoğul eki\") can be used with nouns and with third-person verbs:\n\nNouns are derived from verbs in several ways. The number of ways of forming \"verbal\" nouns (\"fiil isimleri\") from verb-stems can be debated; here are three:\n\nSeveral series of endings show distinctions of person (\"kişi\"); they are given here, along with the personal pronouns for comparison:\nThe names given to the personal endings here are not standard. These endings are often just referred to as type I, II, III, and IV respectively; but the order in which the types are numbered is also not standard. Lewis (1967) refers to the suffixes of possession as \"personal\" endings.\n\nIn the third person, plural number is not always explicitly marked, and the same form is used for both singular and plural. If the plural suffix \"-ler\" is used, it combines with the personal endings as indicated in the final column of the table.\n\nA \"suffix of possession\" gives the person of the \"possessor\" of the object named by the noun to which the suffix is attached; it also indicates a subject for a participle. (See .)\n\nA \"predicative\" ending can assign a person to a noun, thus creating a complete sentence:\n\nSee also and Turkish copula.\n\nAll of the personal suffixes can be used in the formation of verbs.\nVerb-\"stems\" have been mentioned. \nA verb-base is obtained from a verb-\"stem\" by attachment of certain suffixes or characteristics given below.\nThen the personal endings here called \"predicative\" and \"verbal\" attach only to verb-\"bases\"; the optative and imperative endings attach to verb-\"stems\".\nThe first syllable of the present/imperfective tense suffix (\"-iyor\") exhibits vowel harmony while the second is invariable. When suffixed to a stem ending in a vowel, that vowel is elided: \"ye-\" + \"-iyor\" → \"yiyor\". The aorist negative and impotential forms are given here because they are anomalous. Note, that the \"-z\" of the aorist negative (\"-mez\") and impotential (\"-(y)emez\") is dropped in the first-person singular and plural, in order to be able to suffix it (but is retained when the interrogative particle \"mi\" intervenes; see below). (Aorist negative first-person singular: \"-mem\"; but: aorist impotential third-person plural: \"-(y)emezler\".)\n\nSee also \"Negation and potential in verb-stems\" under below.\n\nSome third-person verbs also function as participles.\nParticiples can be classified as personal, if they take a suffix of possession, and impersonal, if they do not. The following suffixes attach to verb-stems:\nThe interrogative particle (\"soru eki\") is not written as a suffix, but phonetically it is enclitic; in particular, it exhibits vowel harmony:\n\nA Turkish noun has no gender.\nThe dictionary-form of a noun can take up to four (kinds of) #Inflectional suffixes, generally in the following order:\nThrough its presence or absence, the plural ending shows distinctions of number.\n\nA noun is made plural by addition of \"-ler\" or \"-lar\" (depending on the vowel harmony). When a numeral is used with a noun, however, the plural suffix is usually \"not\" used: \n\nThe plural ending also allows a family (living in one house) to be designated by a single member:\n\nIn the last example, the first-person singular suffix of possession comes \"before\" the plural ending; this is an exception to the order of suffixes given above. In the usual order, we have:\n\nNouns are pluralized in standard temporal greetings.\n\nAs noted earlier, the suffixes of possession give the person (and number) of the \"possessor\" of what is named by the noun:\nWhen a word takes one of the endings of possession, the word becomes the name of something \"possessed\", not possessing. The word for the possessor, if present, takes the genitive case ending.\n\nThe plural ending will not be attached twice to the same word; therefore ambiguity is possible:\n\nAmbiguity can be resolved with #Pronouns.\n\nTurkish cases and case endings (\"durum ekleri\" from \"dur-\" \"stop, last\", or \"hâl ekleri\" from \"hâl\" \"state, condition\") can be named (in English) and used roughly as in Latin:\n\nThe absolute case combines the uses of the nominative, vocative, and (in part) accusative cases. It is for subjects, and for names of people being addressed. It is also used for \"indefinite\" direct objects. \"Definite\" direct objects are in the definite-accusative case:\n\nThe dative case tells \"whither\", that is, the place \"to which\". \nThus it has roughly the meaning of the English prepositions \"to\" and \"into\", and also \"in\" when it can be replaced with \"into\":\n\nThe dative also is for objects, usually indirect objects, but sometimes objects that in English would be considered direct:\n\nThe locative case tells \"where\", hence corresponds to the English prepositions \"at\", \"on\", and \"in\" (when it does not mean \"into\").\n\nThe ablative case tells \"whence\", that is, the place \"from which\" (or through which), hence:\n\n\n\nIn Turkish terminology, the genitive case indicates a \"compounding\" (\"tamlayan\") word. The corresponding \"compounded\" (\"tamlanan\") word will take the appropriate suffix of possession. The pair of these words is then a definite compound (\"belirtili tamlama\"):\n\nHowever, if two nouns are connected, but not by ownership, then the second noun generally takes an ending of possession, while the first takes no ending. The result is an indefinite compound (\"belirtisiz tamlama\"):\n\nIf one noun names a material, the other noun need not take an ending:\n\nIf a noun is to be in the first or second person, one of the predicative suffixes (or type-I personal suffixes) will show this.\nExamples\n\nIn the third person, no ending is required.\nHowever, the ending \"-dir\" can be used; it is said to be the remnant of a verb \"turur\" \"S/he stands\".\nAgain in the third person, the plural suffix may be used:\n\nSeveral suffixes can be combined:\n\nThe infinitive, formed with \"-mek\" as noted earlier, does not take a suffix of possession, or the genitive case-ending. It does take all other case-endings. In particular, the progressive characteristic given earlier is the infinitive ending with the locative ending:\n\nThe verbal noun in \"-me\" is called a \"gerund\" above, since it corresponds roughly to the English gerund.\n\nThe verbal noun can take a suffix of possession and any case-ending:\n\nThe dative form of a Turkish gerund can correspond precisely to an English infinitive with \"to\":\n\nThe suffix \"-iş\" can also be used to create verbal nouns:\n\nThe verb \"et-\" \"make, do\" can be considered as an auxiliary verb, since for example it is often used with verbal nouns borrowed from other languages, such as Arabic:\nConsidered as units, these are transitive verbs; but the nouns in them can also, by themselves, take direct objects:\n\nWhat looks like an ablative gerund is usually an adverb; the ending \"-meden\" usually has the sense of \"without\". \nSee #Adverbs below.\n\nAn infinitive in the absolute case can be the object of a verb such as \"iste-\" \"want\":\nthat is, \"Some want to continue their education, and some want to work\"\n(\"source:\" \"Cumhuriyet Pazar Dergi\", 14 August 2005, p. 1.) Note here that the compound verb \"devam et-\" \"continue, last\" does not take a direct object, but is complemented by a dative noun.\n\nAnother way to express obligation (besides with \"lâzım\" as in the earlier example) is by means of \"zor\" \"trouble, compulsion\" and an infinitive:\n\nBoth an infinitive and a gerund are objects of the postposition \"için\" \"for\" in the third sentence of the quotation within the following quotation:\n\nA free translation is:\n\nThe facility authorities said: \"The people of this district [namely Edremit, Van] are generally conservative. They cannot enter the lake comfortably, because the shore areas are near the road. So we are using a screen, both to close off the view of passersby on the road, and so that men will not cause discomfort.\" However, children cannot be prevented from spying on the other side through gaps in the screen.\n\nCertain verbs in Turkish are used to enhance the meaning of other verbs, or to agglutinate verbs from nouns. These verbs are called auxiliary verbs. A concise list follows:\n\nVerbs that are used with nouns to agglutinate new verbs\n\nExamples\nIf there is a change in the noun root through the process of agglutination, it is written adjacently. These are mostly Arabic loan-words, which switch to their more original form.\n\nIn Turkish words, two consonants of a syllable need a vowel to be pronounced. There are exceptions in loan words only, but those that lost their original form are more common. This occurs in two ways:\n\nIf a word ends in two identical consonants, one is dropped, e.g. \"hall\" (\"state, status\") becomes \"hal\"; \"aff\" (\"amnesty, forgiving\") becomes \"af\".\n\nIf a syllable ends in two different consonants, a vowel is added between them; e.g., \"hükm\" (\"judgement\") becomes \"hüküm\".\n\nExceptions: Words which end in \"nk\", \"rt\", \"rk\", such as (\"throne\"), \"renk\" (\"colour\"), \"kart\" (\"card\"), do not add a vowel. Most of these are loan-words from Persian or Western languages (but \"zevk\" \"pleasure\" from Arabic ذَوْق).\n\nExamples\nVerbs that are used with other verbs to enhance the meaning:\n\n\nExamples\n\nAdjectives used \"attributively\" precede the noun; used \"predicatively\", they follow, unless something other than word order shows that they are being used predicatively:\n\nMost adjectives in the dictionary are descriptive. The two most fundamental descriptive adjectives are:\n\nThese are used only predicatively:\n\n\nThe cardinal number \"bir\" (\"one\") can be used as an indefinite article. Word order can make a difference:\n\nUnless it is being used by itself, elliptically, the adjective \"hiç\" (\"no\") requires an additional word with negative force:\n\nCompare:\n\nIn a positive comparison, the object takes the ablative case; the adverb \"daha\" (\"more\") is optional, unless the object is left out.\n\nIn a negative comparison, the adverb \"az\" (\"less\") is needed; the object still takes the ablative; \"daha\" can still be used as well.\n\nThe superlative degree is expressed by the adverb \"en\" (\"most\").\n\nIt is noted under #Parts of speech that Turkish participles (\"sıfat-fiiller\") can be classified as\n\nIn a personal participle, the suffix of possession signifies the \"subject\" of the underlying verb; if this possessor is third person, then the possessor may be further specified with a noun in the genitive case.\n\nThe noun modified by a personal participle as an adjective may be the direct object of the underlying verb; the connexion may also be more vague.\n\nThe noun modified by an impersonal participle is generally the subject of the underlying verb (but see Lewis (1967: IX,2)).\n\nThe aorist tense (\"geniş zaman\" \"broad time\") is for habitual actions; the present tense (\"şimdiki zaman\" \"time that is now\") is for actions ongoing or contemplated.\n\nthat is, \"No legal process has begun concerning the AKP members who pulled out guns and fired them in the air\"; for \"-ip\" see #Adverbs below.\n\nthat is, \"last week\";\n\nA personal participle can be construed as a noun and used in parallel with verbal nouns:\nthat is, \"Children are working, 68% to provide for their family's needs, 21% because their family wants it, 6% to learn a job or profession, 4% to meet their [own] needs.\"\n\nThe following sentence from a newspaper headline contains twenty-two words, nine derived from verbs, four of these as participles, three as gerunds. Note also the use of \"kontrol\" from French as a verbal noun with \"et-\":\n\nIn other words:\n\nSaying that, by not joining the EU and by drawing close to the Islamic world, Turkey would be pushed into the lap of those who favor sharia, French senator Duireux made clear that it was necessary to control the Islamic tide.\nThe adverb of negation is \"değil\". It is used to negate sentences that are without verb or \"var\"; then it takes the appropriate personal ending:\n\nA number of adverbs are derived from verbs:\n\nThe ending \"-e\" is seen in:\n\nThe ending \"-erek\" denotes action at the same time as, or preceding, that of another verb:\n[the latter is Bülent Ecevit as quoted in \"Cumhuriyet\", 20 July 2005].\n[\"Buğday\" magazine, 7–8/2005, no 32].\n\nFrom \"ol-\" \"be, become\", \"olarak\" forms adverbial phrases corresponding to those in English with \"as\":\n\nThe ending \"-meden\" on a verb-stem looks like the ablative gerund, but it is not (Lewis [XI,12]). \nIt indicates an action not occurring at all, or following that of the main verb:\nComplementing \"önce\" \"before\" is \"sonra\" \"after\", which can follow a verb-stem given the ending \"-dikten\":\nSimultaneity is expressed by \"iken\" or its (not enclitic) suffixed form \"-(y)ken\"; but if it follows a verb, then the verb appears, not as a stem, but as a \"base\"; see #Bases of verbs:\n\nIf two verbs of the same grammatical form have the same subject, the endings on the first verb can be replaced by \"-ip\"; see the example under #Participles.\n\nThe third-person personal pronoun \"o\" \"she/he/it\" is declined as if it were the noun \"on\".\nThe other persons, \"ben\" \"I\", \"sen\" \"you (singular/informal)\", \"biz\" \"we\", \"siz\" \"you (plural/formal)\", are declined like nouns, except for a vowel change in the dative, and an anomalous genitive; also the plural forms do not involve \"-ler\":\nThe absolute case is generally needed only for emphasis:\n\nThe third-person pronoun can clear up an ambiguity mentioned above:\nThe pronoun \"o\" is also one of the demonstrative pronouns:\nThe latter two are declined like \"o\" (that is, treated as if they were \"bun\" and \"şun\").\n\nThe interrogative pronouns (and adjectives) are:\n\nThese appear in embedded questions but do not serve as true relative pronouns:\n\nThere is a suffix \"-ki\" that acts as a relative pronoun in that it creates what, in English, would be called relative clauses. It does not display vowel harmony, except in a few common formations:\n\nThe reflexive pronoun (\"dönüşlü zamir\" from \"dön-\" \"turn\") is \"kendi\" \"own, self\":\n\nMany of the indefinite adjectives can function as pronouns, taking case-endings.\n\nMany stems in the dictionary are indivisible; others consist of endings attached to a root.\n\nThe verb-stem \"temizle-\" \"make clean\" is the adjective \"temiz\" \"clean\" with the suffix \"-le\"; this suffix was mentioned earlier under #Parts of speech in connexion with the verb \"köpekle-\". Many verbs are formed from nouns or adjectives with \"-le\":\n\nA verbal root, or a verb-stem in \"-le\", can be lengthened with certain extensions. If present, they appear in the following order, and they indicate distinctions of voice:\nThese endings might seem to be \"inflectional\" in the sense of the above, but their meanings are not always clear from their particular names, and dictionaries do generally give the resulting forms, so in this sense they are \"constructive\" endings.\n\nThe causative extension makes an intransitive verb transitive, and a transitive verb factitive. Together, the reciprocal and causative extension make the repetitive extension \"-(i)ştir\".\n\nA dictionary-stem is positive; it can be made:\nAny of these three (kinds of) stems can be made potential by addition of \"-e\" and then \"-bil\". The \"-bil\" is not enclitic, but represents the verb \"bil-\" \"know, be able\"; the first syllable of the impotential ending represents an obsolete verb \"u-\" \"be powerful, able\" #Lewis [VIII,55].\nSo far then, there are six kinds of stems:\nSuch stems are not used for aorist forms, which have their own peculiar means of forming negatives and impotentials.\n\nThe characteristics with which verb-bases are formed from stems are given under . Note again that aorist verbs have their own peculiar negative and impotential forms.\n\nThe progressive base in \"-mekte\" is discussed under .\nAnother base, namely the necessitative (\"gereklilik\"), is formed from a verbal noun.\nThe characteristic is \"-meli\", where \"-li\" forms adjectives from nouns, and \"-me\" forms gerunds from verb-stems. \nA native speaker may perceive the ending \"-meli\" as indivisible; the analysis here is from #Lewis [VIII,30]).\n\nThe present base is derived from the ancient verb \"yorı-\" \"go, walk\" #Lewis [VIII,16]; this can be used for ongoing actions, or for contemplated future actions.\n\nThe meaning of the aorist base is described under #Adjectives from verbs: participles.\n\nThere is some irregularity in first-person negative and impotential aorists. The full form of the base \"-mez\" (or \"(y)emez\") reappears before the interrogative particle \"mi\":\n\nThe definite past or \"di\"-past is used to assert that something did happen in the past.\nThe inferential past or \"miş\"-past can be understood as asserting that a past participle is applicable \"now\"; hence it is used when the fact of a past event, as such, is not important; in particular, the inferential past is used when one did not actually witness the past event.\n\nA newspaper will generally use the \"di\"-past, because it is authoritative. The need to indicate uncertainty and inference by means of the \"miş\"-past may help to explain the extensive use of \"ki\" in the newspaper excerpt at Turkish vocabulary#The conjunction ki.\n\nThe conditional (\"şart\") verb could also be called \"hypothetical\"; it is used for remote possibilities, or things one might wish for. (See also #Compound bases.)\n\nThe various bases thus give distinctions of tense, aspect and mood. These can be briefly tabulated:\n\nThe interrogative particle \"mi\" precedes predicative (type-I) endings (except for the 3rd person plural \"-ler\"), but follows the complete verb formed from a verbal, type-II ending:\n\nUsually, in the optative (\"istek\"), only the first-person forms are used, and these supply the lack of a first-person imperative (\"emir\"). \nIn common practice then, there is one series of endings to express something wished for: \n\nThe ancient verb \"er-\" #Lewis [VIII,2] survives in Turkish in three bases:\nThe form \"iken\" given under #Adverbs from verbs is also descended from \"er-\".\nSince no more bases are founded on the stem \"i-\", this verb can be called defective. In particular, \"i-\" forms no negative or impotential stems; negation is achieved with the #Adverb of negation, \"değil\", given earlier.\n\nThe \"i-\" bases are often turned into base-forming suffixes without change in meaning; the corresponding suffixes are\nwhere the \"y\" is used only after vowels. For example, \"Hasta imiş\" and \"Hastaymış\" both mean, \"Apparently/Reportedly, he/she/it is ill\".\n\nThe verb \"i-\" serves as a copula. When a copula is needed, but the appropriate base in \"i-\" does not exist, then the corresponding base in \"ol-\" is used; when used otherwise this stem means \"become\".\n\nThe verb \"i-\" is irregular in the way it is used in questions: the particle \"mi\" always precedes it:\n\nThe bases so far considered can be called \"simple\". A base in \"i-\" can be attached to another base, forming a compound base. One can then interpret the result in terms of English verb forms by reading backwards. The following list is representative, not exhaustive:\nBy means of \"ise\" or \"-(y)se\", a verb can be made conditional in the sense of being the hypothesis or protasis of a complex statement:\nThe simple conditional can be used for remote conditions:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Federation was created late in 1934 by the decision of the \"Supreme Council of Physical Culture\" of the USSR (, VSFK) as its sports section governing specifically football. It was the only organization that obtained recognition of FIFA in 1946.\n\nAfter the establishment of the Soviet regime in the former Russian Empire all its former affiliations abroad were discontinued. Football life in the country however did not stop. In July 1920 the first championship of the Russian SFSR took place, won by the collective city team of Moscow. In September 1923 the first championship of the Soviet Union took place which was won also by the Moscow team. In August 1928 the first Spartakiad took place in Moscow (not to be confused with the Spartakiad of Peoples of the USSR) which included a football tournament.\n\nOn 27 May 1934, the \"Distinguished Master of Sports\" achievement award was established, and given to eight footballers that same year.\n\nOn 27 December 1934, the All-Union Council of Physical Culture (VSFK) of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union (TsIK USSR) established a special public organization – the Football Section of the USSR – to take charge of football events in the country. In addition, there was also the Football Directorate of the Soviet Sports Committee, subordinated directly to the Soviet government.\n\nOn 30 August 1935 the national team of the Ukrainian SSR beat Red Star Olympique (from France) 6:1. Goals were scored by Shylovsky (3), Parovyshnikov (2), Shchehodsky. Team squad of UkrSSR (2-3-5): <br>\nNext month a collective team of Prague visited the Soviet Union playing against team of Leningrad, Moscow, and UkrSSR.

The first recipient of Order of Lenin among football players became Nikolai Starostin. The Order of the Red Banner of Labour received Alexander Starostin and Sergei Ilyin, other nine players received Order of the Badge of Honor.\n\nDuring World War II (1941–1944) the main football events were suspended, but there were several regional competitions. When the Soviet Union was liberated from the occupation of Nazi Germany in August 1944 the next national cup competition took place as the first official post-war football event.\n\nIn July 1946 the Football Section of the USSR was admitted to FIFA on the proposition of delegates from Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia and on 27 September 1947 the USSR was awarded a permanent seat of the vice-president of FIFA which was taken by Valentin Granatkin. The main national football team of the Soviet Union however did not compete at the FIFA World Cup until 1958. The first coach appointed was Boris Arkadiev who in 1952 led the team to the Olympic games in Helsinki. He later along with several other football specialist was accused of sabotaging the team that was eliminated in the tournament's Round of 16.\n\nIn January 1957 the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR awarded the Order of Lenin to Vsevolod Bobrov and Lev Yashin to commemorate their achievements in sport.\n\nIn May 1959 the Football Section of the USSR was reorganized as the Football Federation of the USSR.\n\nIn 1960 the national team of the Soviet Union won the first continental championship beating the national team of Yugoslavia 2:1 in extra time.\n\nIn 1963 Lev Yashin became the first Soviet player to be awarded the Ballon d'Or.\n\nFor the first time in 1965–66 season the Soviet football clubs debuted in the European international football competitions.\n\nIn 1972 the Football Federation of the USSR became a government agency of the State Committee of Sports (Goskomsport). However, because Granatkin continued to chair the Football Federation, that reorganization did not drew much attention from FIFA.\n\nDynamo Kyiv became the first Soviet club to win a European club trophy, when they defeated Ferencvaros 3–0 in the 1975 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final.\n\nIn 1988 Lev Yashin received the golden order of FIFA \"For service\" and in March 1990 was recognized as the Hero of Socialist Labour. Next month the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet awarded the Hero of Socialist Labour to Nikolai Starostin as well.\n\nOn 8 February 1992 the federation was recognized as the parent association of the newly established Russian Football Union (RFS). In July of the same year the Executive Committee of FIFA confirmed the succession of the Soviet federation as the Russian Football Union and readmitted it under the new name and statute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2225545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2225545", "title": "Georgians in Turkey", "text": "Georgians in Turkey\n\nGeorgians in Turkey () refers to citizens and denizens of Turkey who are, or descend from, ethnic Georgians.\n\nIn the census of 1965, those who spoke Georgian as first language were proportionally most numerous in Artvin (3.7%), Ordu (0.9%) and Kocaeli (0.8%).\n\nGeorgians live scattered throughout Turkey, although they are concentrated on two major regions of residence:\n\n\nMagnarella estimated the number of Georgians in Turkey to have been over 60,000 in 1979.\n\nImerkhevians (Shavshetians) are an ethnographic subgroup of Georgians who speak the Imerkhevian dialect (\"imerkheuli\") of the Georgian language, which shares many common features with the neighboring Adjarian. Imerkhevians are indigenous population of Artvin Province.\n\nThe majority of the Imerkhevians today live in an area they call Imerkhevi, the name of the cultural region traditionally inhabited by the Imerkhevian. The population of Imerkhevi is largely composed of ethnic Georgians, who inhabit 14 hamlets around Meydancık, formerly known as Diobani. These settlements have both official Turkish and unofficial Georgian names. Reflecting some internal differentiation persisting in Turkey's Georgian community, the Imerkhevians claim a different origin from the Georgians in the Borçka area, who have adopted an inclusive Adjar identity. The Imerkhevians are Sunni Muslims, closely integrated with the Turkish society. Almost all are bilingual in Georgian and Turkish.\n\nChveneburi had arrived in Turkey basically in three waves of migration due to pogroms and what is now termed ethnic cleansing of Caucasians by the Russian Empire. The first wave was during and after the Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829 when the Sublime Porte consigned its sovereignty over several parts of Georgia to the Russian Empire.\n\nMinor immigrations had also followed until the end of Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878 when Ottoman Empire allowed Chveneburis to immigrate, the major wave of immigration involved at least 500,000 people from historic Georgian regions that had considerable Muslim populations such as Batumi and Kars. This wave of being \"muhajirs\", known as \"muhajiroba\" (მუჰაჯირობა) had left many Muslim-majority regions of Georgia virtually depopulated.\n\nThe last sizable wave of immigration was in 1921 when Turkey finally gave up its claims on Adjara in the Treaty of Kars with the Soviet republics. This last wave also involved Turkish-speaking Muslims from Upper Adjara. Adjarians were also known by their places of origin, such as \"Batumlular\" for people from Batumi, \"Çürüksulular\" for people from Kobuleti.Chveneburi (, ), meaning \"of us\" in Georgian, is an autonym of Muslim immigrants of Georgian descent who had settled in non-Georgian majority regions of Turkey, thus, \"of us\" signifies a triple distinction from Christian Georgians, Muslim Turks, and autochthonous Muslim Georgians from Artvin. As with most Turkish citizens, most Chveneburi subscribe to the Hanafi \"madh'hab\" of Sunni Islam.\n\nThe most important Georgian cultural magazine in Turkey also bears the name \"Çveneburi\". It was founded in 1977 in Stockholm, Sweden by Shalva Tevzadze. It is distributed in Turkey by Ahmet Özkan Melashvili, who also wrote the book \"Gürcüstan\" (Georgia) in 1968. In 1980, Özkan was assassinated in Bursa by the Grey Wolves. Since then, Fahrettin Çiloğlu has been in charge of the magazine (1993). Between 1997 and 2006, Osman Nuri Mercan was the editor of the magazine. The magazine's content is almost completely in Turkish and presents articles on Chveneburi as well as the present situation and the history of Georgia and Georgians worldwide. Another journal, Pirosmani, bilingual in Georgian and Turkish, is published in Istanbul, sponsored by theGeorgian Catholic Simon Zazadze.\n\nGroup identity is shaped basically by the schism with Christian Georgians. Chveneburi usually restrain from using the word \"Kartveli\" (ქართველი) as a self-designation because they think it indicates being a Christian. They prefer to use \"Gurji\" (Gürcü) (გურჯი) when referring to their more precise ethnic background.\n\nIntermarriage with other Sunni groups is common. In some regions, specifically Ünye for instance, Chveneburi women are sought-after brides, seen by the local rural Turkish population as beautiful and hard-working wives. This phenomenon further accelerates cultural and linguistic assimilation of the community.\n\nLaz people are an indigenous Kartvelian-speaking ethnic group inhabiting the Black Sea coastal regions of Turkey and Georgia. Estimates of the total population of the Laz people today vary drastically, with numbers as low as 45,000 to as high as 1.6 million people, with the majority living in northeast Turkey. The Laz speak the Laz language, a member of the same Kartvelian language family as Georgian, Svan, and Mingrelian.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1998 it won \"Museum of the Year\" and has other awards including in 2004 both the \"Excellence in England Small Tourist Attraction of the Year\" and \"Sandford Award for Heritage Education\".\n\nThe building is a Grade II listed building, the former Leeds Union Workhouse, which opened in 1861 (foundation stone laid 1858) to accommodate 784 paupers. By the end of the 19th century, the buildings had become largely used for medical care of the poor, rather than workhouse and training. During the First World War it was called the East Leeds War Hospital, caring for armed services personnel. The building was later known as the Ashley Wing, which was part of the hospital until the 1990s when the old Leeds Union Workhouse building was considered unfit for modern medicine. As a listed building, it could not be demolished and Parliament gave permission for it to house the Thackray Medical Museum, which opened in 1997.\n\nThe museum's origins can be traced to Great George Street, Leeds, where Charles Thackray opened a small family-run chemist shop in 1902. In less than a century the corner shop grew into one of Britain's principal medical companies, Chas F Thackray Limited, manufacturing drugs and medical instruments and pioneering the hip replacement operation alongside Sir John Charnley. In the 1980s Charles Thackray's grandson Paul Thackray established a small collection as an archive of the Leeds-based medical supplies company. In 1990 a charitable trust was established to develop the collection.\n\nHighlights include \"Leeds 1842: Life in Victorian Leeds\": visitors walk through a reproduction of slum streets complete with authentic sights, sounds and smells and are invited to follow the lives, ailments and treatments of eight Victorian characters, making the choices that determine their survival amongst the rats, fleas and bedbugs. \"Pain, Pus and Blood\" describes surgery before anaesthesia, and how pain relief progressed and \"Having a Baby\" focuses on developments in safety for childbirth. \"Hannah Dyson's Ordeal\" is a video reconstruction of 1842 surgery, before anaesthetics were in use: visitors watch as a surgeon, his assistant and a group of trainee doctors prepare for Hannah Dyson's operation - the amputation of her leg after it was crushed in a mill accident. (The actual operation is not seen in the reconstruction.) \"The LifeZone!\" is an interactive children's gallery, looking at how the human body works, with a smaller room for the under-fives. The 'Recovery?' Gallery explores treatment of veterans of warfare, looking at the First World War and modern conflict medicine. There is a temporary exhibition gallery which changes annually.\nThe Thackray Medical Museum houses a collection of over 50,000 objects from medical history which date from Roman times to the present day. The museum also cares for a collection of historical medical trade literature, which can be accessed by visitors in the museum's Library and Resource Centre by appointment.\nHighlights in the collection include the Wilkinson English Delftware apothecary jar display, an impressive display of early pharmaceutical jars which are all on permanent display. Also on display is Prince Albert's personal medicine chest and a selection of eighteenth and nineteenth century surgical equipment including amputation knives, saws and trepanning instruments.\n\nThe Thackray Medical Museum featured in \"Most Haunted\" on 1 November 2015 on Really (TV channel).\n\nThe Thackray Medical Museum was one of fifteen venues across the UK, Europe and Africa to have been selected by the Wellcome Trust to, simultaneously, exhibit the winning collection from the Wellcome Image Awards, 2016. The awards celebrate scientists, clinicians, photographers and artists of images that best communicate significant aspects of biomedical science. A temporary exhibition of twenty images was displayed at the Thackray Medical Museum. The display included inside the human eye, a 3D image produced using optical coherence tomography. The image depicts blood vessels as tunnel like structures. Other images focused on bone development, the Ebola virus and engineering human liver tissue.\n\nThe museum offers a medicine and history lecture series which runs from October to March each year. Lectures focus on the changing nature of health and medicine. Themes explored include robot-assisted surgery and health informatics.\n\nVisited by 20,000 school students each year the museum delivers a series of in-classroom work and education resources, loans boxes and teacher events. The museum has been awarded the Sandford Award for Heritage Education.\n\n \n"}

{"id": "2225564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2225564", "title": "Yichud", "text": "Yichud\n\nIn Jewish religious law (\"halakha\"), the laws of yichud ( \"issur yichud\", \"prohibition of seclusion\") prohibit seclusion in a private area of a man and a woman who are not married to each other. Such seclusion is prohibited in order to prevent the two from being tempted or having the opportunity to commit adulterous or promiscuous acts. A person who is present in order to prevent \"yichud\" is called a shomer.\n\nThe laws of \"yichud\" are typically followed in Orthodox Judaism. Adherents of Conservative and Reform Judaism do not generally abide by the laws of \"yichud\".\n\nThe term \"\"yichud\"\" also refers to a ritual during an Ashkenazi Jewish wedding in which the newly married couple spends a period secluded in a room by themselves. In earlier historical periods, as early as the talmudic era, the marriage would be consummated at this time, but that practice is no longer current.\n\nDeuteronomy 13:7 says: If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you love, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, 'Let us go and worship other gods, gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known...'\n\nThe Talmud gives an explanation to the passage, which is supposed to be a hint of \"yichud\":\n\nSaid R. Johanan on the authority of R. Ishmael, Where do we find an allusion to yihud in the Torah? - For it is written: If thy brother, the son of thy mother, entices thee [etc.]: does then only a mother's son entice, and not a father's son? But it is to tell you: a son may be alone with his mother, but not with any other woman interdicted in the Torah.\n\nThe Talmud also claims that after the rape of Tamar, daughter of David, when she was left alone with her half-brother Amnon, David and his high court extended this prohibition to unmarried girls as well. Later, in the times of Shammai and Hillel the Elder, the prohibition was extended to include a non-Jewish woman. These rules are discussed in the Talmud.\n\nMost rishonim define the prohibition of \"yichud\" as a Torah law. Although Maimonides writes that the prohibition of \"yichud\" is derived from \"divrei kabbalah\" (Bible texts later than the Pentateuch), many interpret his words as meaning that it is a Torah law, though some regard it as a rabbinic prohibition.\n\nRashi maintained that insofar as the prohibition of \"yichud\" is mandated by the Torah, it is an essential prohibition, whereas rabbinical extensions of the prohibition are enacted as a fence meant to distance a person from forbidden relationships. Hence, leniencies would apply only to the rabbinic additions to the laws of \"yichud\". Halachic consensus, following Maimonides, is, though, that leniencies apply even to Torah-mandated \"yichud\" laws.\n\nThe laws of \"yichud\" provide for strong restrictions on unrelated members of the opposite sex being secluded together, and milder ones for close family members. Different opinions exist regarding application of these laws both in terms of situation and in terms of the individuals involved. Prohibition of \"yichud\" applies to men over 13 years and, generally, girls over three, and a woman over twelve may not be alone with a boy over nine. Even seclusion of short duration is forbidden, if it could potentially last longer.\n\nThere are a number of circumstances, under which the prohibition of \"yichud\" may be circumvented. Typically, these apply fully to \"yichud\" with an observant Jew. Meeting a non-Jew or a secular Jew may require more scrupulousness.\n\nIf the husband is in town (\"Baaloh B'ir\", or \"Baala Bair\"), or, more precisely, if it is possible that he can appear suddenly, a woman may be secluded with another man in her home. The fear of his sudden appearance is considered a deterrent to engaging in illicit behavior. If the husband works fixed hours, or if they meet where they are not likely to be found, the husband's presence in town does not circumvent \"yichud\". A close, long-standing relationship (\"Libo Gas Boh\") between the wife and another man also proscribes \"yichud\" in spite of the husband's presence in town. The lenience caused by the man's presence in town does not, however apply to his being secluded with another woman when his wife may appear suddenly. Paradoxically, if a husband gives his wife permission to be secluded with a man, the lenience does no longer apply, since she does not fear his sudden entrance.\n\nRashi believes that the husband’s presence in town only mitigates the prohibition, rather than abrogating it. The Shulchan Aruch, following Tosafot, however, rule that when the husband is in town the \"yichud\" restriction does not apply at all.\n\nMaimonides and Shulchan Aruch write that the rationale for Baaloh B'ir is that \"her husband's fear is upon her.\" This does not imply a concrete fear that her husband will enter unexpectedly, but rather that she feels a natural inhibition, in the knowledge that her husband is close by. As a consequence of this, she can be in \"yichud\" with another man in a large city, like London or New York, where the chance that he suddenly appears is non-existent. Neither does her husband's permission undermine the leniency, according to this interpretation. Rashi interprets Baalo B'ir as referring to a concrete fear of sudden exposure. So does rabbi Moshe Feinstein, who consequently rules in a stricter way. Another issue of debate is whether cities who have grown together to form a continuous area are to be treated as one city. Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach argues that if the wife is in Ramat Gan and the husband is in Tel Aviv he is still considered to be \"in town\". Since there are no significant uninhabited areas separating these cities, they are defined as one city from a Halachic perspective.\n\n\"Yichud\" is alleviated when the door is open. This principle is known as \"pesach pasuach lireshus harabim\" (lit. an open doorway to the public domain). The Shulchan Aruch rules: \"If the door is open to the public domain, there is no concern of yichud.\" This ruling has been interpreted and enlarged in various ways: 1. the door is actually open 2. when the door is closed but unlocked 3. then door is locked, but somebody with a key is liable to come in at any time 4. the door is locked, but there is a reasonable possibility that people may knock on the door and expect to be answered (according to Moshe Feinstein). A woman being secluded with another man is also justified when people outside can see through the window what is going on inside the house. In case of a close, long-standing friendship between the man and the woman, however, a more stringent behavior is expected. The leniency usually does not apply late at night, as there is little or no chance that people would come in unexpectedly then.\n\n\"Yichud\" can be circumvented by the presence of other individuals (\"shomrim,\" guards or Chaperones), who would serve to provide a check on the man's behavior. Generally, Torah-observant Jewish men qualify as \"shomrim\". Female relatives that permit \"yichud\" are: a man's mother; his daughter or granddaughter; his sister; his grandmother; and a woman's mother-in-law, daughter-in-law and sister-in-law. Children aged 6–9 also qualify.\nAlthough \"yichud\" with a woman and two or more men, according to most poskim, is permitted during day time and in the evening, the presence of at least three men is required during nighttime sleeping hours. The same goes for situations when children are present instead of adults. Sefardic Jews require the presence of the wife of one of the men for a woman to be secluded with them.\n\nShulchan Aruch, though, follows Maimonides in ruling that \"yichud\" with one woman is prohibited even with many men. The disagreement is based on a passage in Gemara, which states that the permission for two men to be secluded with one woman applies only to kosher people, and tells a story where two acharonim met a woman in a secluded place, and one of them preferred to leave, since perchance only tzaddikim are defined as kosher. Nissim of Gerona considered this an excessive stringency, and thought that regular people are defined as kosher. Moses Isserles follows this view, and states that \"yichud\" with one woman and several men is prohibited only for promiscuous people.\n\nAccording to Rashi, \"yichud\" is permitted when at least three women are present, but most poskim follow Maimonides, who ruled that no number of women present circumvents the prohibition of \"yichud\". Many poskim permits \"yichud\" in the presence of the man's grandmother, mother, daughter, granddaughter or sister [over seven years], but do not accept the woman's daughter, granddaughter or sister. Avraham Danzig writes that the prohibition for one man to be in seclusion with two women is only rabbinic, whereas Torah law only prohibits a man from being secluded with one woman.\n\nIt is preferable that a brother and sister who have reached the age of six should not sleep in the same room. \"Yichud\" between a brother and a sister above the age of Bar and Bat Mitzvah is considered appropriate for a short term, but not when their parents are away for an extended period of time. There are various opinions about the duration of a permitted \"yichud\". Some poskim allow only up to three nights; others allow up to thirty days. If the brother and sister live separately and one comes to visit the other, \"yichud\" is permitted as long as they do not stay longer than the normal stay of a house guest (where circumstances like the distance of their residence is taken into account). However, when a sibling moves in on a permanent basis, \"yichud\" is forbidden even for one day.\n\nOpinions among Poskim are divided about \"yichud\" between adoptive parents and their children of the opposite gender, who were adopted at a very young age. Rabbis Moshe Feinstein, Eliezer Waldenberg, Hayim David HaLevi, and Nahum Rabinovitch all ruled that adoptive parents are permitted to engage in \"yichud\" with their adopted children since sexual attraction normally does not occur in such situations. Feinstein, though, restricts the permission to situations when both adoptive parents are alive and married to each other, and Waldenberg only permits \"yichud\" if a girl was adopted before the age of three and a boy was adopted before the age of nine. Ovadia Yosef is essentially lenient about this issue, though he believes that it is preferable to adopt a girl so that the wife who is home most of the time can prevent \"yichud\" with the husband from occurring.\n\nThe lenient view is strongly opposed by others, particularly in Haredi Judaism. Menachem Mendel Schneerson vigorously argued that \"yichud\" is forbidden in the adoptive situation. He insists that this was common custom in earlier generations. Dov Berish Weidenfeld, Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky, Ezra Ettiah, Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz, and Shmuel Wosner take the same position.\n\n\"Yichud\" with biological children is fully permitted. The Gemara explains that God was moved by the prayers of the Great Assembly to curtail the \"yetzer hara\" for incest so there is no need for a prohibition when it comes to biological parents and children.\n\nA man and woman who are engaged to be married may not dwell together unless other people are in the same house and the door is unlocked. Leaving the door slightly ajar is commendable. They may not stay together even on a temporary basis, such as in a hotel. According to some poskim, sleeping in the same house if other family members are present does not violate \"yichud\" laws, but should be avoided due to tzniut considerations. Others, including Moses Isserles and Joseph Soloveitchik, however, disagree about this and would not permit sleeping in the home of their future in-laws.\n\nAlthough mingling of men and women does not violate the prohibition of \"yichud\", it should nonetheless be avoided, even if it is for the purpose of fulfilling a mitzvah. Regardless of whether \"yichud\" takes place or not, girlfriend/boyfriend relationships are forbidden, since dating, according to halacha, should not serve other purposes than finding a suitable marriage partner.\n\nUnless it is one's own child, grandchild or sibling, a female over the age of 12 should not babysit a boy 9 or older, and a male over the age of 13 should not babysit a girl 3 or older. The prohibition of \"yichud\" makes some natural solutions problematic, e.g. when a teenage girl who might babysit her sister's son has to consider the possibility of getting into \"yichud\" with her brother-in-law. The situation may be evaded by the presence of another boy or girl aged 6–9, or, such children lacking, by giving a key to the neighbors and asking them to come in unexpectedly. If a father is single, or his wife is away, and he employs a female babysitter, he has to take care that he does not enter the house before the babysitter has exited, unless there are shomrim present; or else, at least he should leave the door open.\n\nVisiting a doctor's office is allowed during regular office hours, when people may enter unexpectedly. Otherwise, a shomer is required. Mortal danger always overrides \"yichud\" laws, although there are authorities who disagree with this. Serious illness, on the other hand, does not alleviate the prohibition of \"yichud\". An exception is, according to Moshe Feinstein, a male patient who has been diagnosed as impotent, but in this case marit ayin calls for carefulness. A dependent adult person in need of care should take a caregiver of the same gender. This applies also to very old men. During daytime, an opposite gender housekeeper and medical staff may visit if the door is unlocked, or the neighbors have a key and are asked to come in unannounced from time to time. Some poskim are lenient when it comes to a doctor's interaction with his patients, since he is supposedly consumed by his work and not likely to think sinful thoughts. They invoke Gemara, which applies this reasoning to allow a professional to mate animals, although it is otherwise forbidden to watch animals mate.\n\nTherapists of the same sex are preferable, but when there is no one else as qualified as a therapist of the opposite gender, there is green light as long as leniences of \"yichud\" are in place. Since the client develops a close relationship with the therapist, Baaloh B'ir does not count.\n\nTwo unrelated, opposite-gender persons may travel in a vehicle together within the local area, but should not take out-of-town trips together, particularly if they are traveling to an area where they are not known to anyone, and will not be able to return on the same day. For tzniut considerations, the woman had better sit in the rear if the man is driving (or vice versa), and engaging in prolonged conversation is not advisable.\n\nIf a woman is traveling in a bus or taxi, and the other passengers get off, leaving her alone with the driver, she should leave the vehicle, unless they drive where there are passersby or a steady stream of traffic. On a bus, train or airplane, sitting adjacent to a member of the opposite gender is permitted, but many Orthodox Jews follow stringencies to avoid this due to the laws of negiah and tzniut.\nAccording to most \"poskim\", there are no restrictions on being secluded together momentarily in a temporary environment, such as an elevator. Since elevators are boarded constantly, there is always a chance that anyone could enter without warning.\n\nIn a location of business, a male and female may be together for business purposes provided that the location where they are has the potential to be viewed from outside. Otherwise, the door has to be unlocked or people with a key allowed to come in unexpectedly. This applies also if they have separate rooms in the same office. A close working relationship excludes the possibility of relying solely on Baaloh B'ir. A man may temporarily be secluded with three women, but not on the basis of a permanent relationship. Two men who are \"prutzim\" (fail to keep the laws of tznius) are not allowed to work with two women. Neither may a woman work together with three non-Jewish men.\n\nA male teacher should take heed that he does not become overly familiar with the girls. A male teacher who is single should not teach young children of either sex, since he may associate with their mothers when they come and pick up their children. In schools with many staff members, however, one may be lenient, and some \"poskim\" take the position that this halacha applies only to situations where the teaching takes place in the private home of the teacher.\n\n\n"}

Built by Armstrong Whitworth at Newcastle on Tyne, she was torpedoed and sunk by German destroyers in Narvik harbour on 9 April 1940.\n\nBuilt as part of the general rearmament in the time leading up to the events in 1905, \"Norge\" remained, along with her sister-ship \"Eidsvold\", the backbone of the Royal Norwegian Navy for just over 40 years. \"Norge\" and \"Eidsvold\" were the largest vessels in the Royal Norwegian Navy, displacing 4,233 tons and crewed by 270 men. Both vessels were considered to be quite powerful for their time, with two 21 cm (8.26 inch) guns as their main armament. They were armoured to withstand battle with ships of a similar size, with 6 inches (15.24 cm) of Krupp cemented armour in the belt and 9 inches (22.86 cm) of the same armour on the two gun turrets.\n\nIt was intended to augment the Norwegian coastal defence ship fleet with the two ships of the \"Bjørgvin\" class, ordered in 1912, but after these were requisitioned by the British Royal Navy while still under construction at the outbreak of World War I the Eidsvold class and the older, two ship strong, \"Tordenskjold\" class was forced to soldier on long after they were obsolete.\n\nOn the morning of 9 April 1940, German forces entered Ofotfjord under cover of fog and heavy snow. The Germans contacted the captain of \"Eidsvold\", demanding that he surrender, and when this was turned down, the battle-ready German destroyers torpedoed \"Eidsvold\" before she could fire her guns.\n\nAboard \"Norge\", deeper inside the fjord, the explosions were heard, but nothing could be seen until two German destroyers suddenly appeared out of the darkness. Captain Per Askim of \"Norge\" gave orders to open fire. Four rounds were fired from the 21 cm guns (one from the fore gun and three from the aft) as well as seven or eight rounds from the starboard 15 cm guns, directed against the German destroyer \"Bernd von Arnim\". The range has been estimated as 800 metres (1/2 mile). Due to the difficult weather conditions, it was hard to use the optical sights for the guns, which resulted in the first salvo falling short of the target and the others going over the target.\n\nThe German destroyers waited until they were alongside the pier before returning fire. \"Bernd von Arnim\" opened fire with her 12.7 cm (5 inch) guns, as well as with machine guns, but the weather gave the Germans problems as well. The destroyer also fired torpedoes—in all three salvoes of two torpedoes each. The first two salvoes missed, but the last struck \"Norge\" midships, and she sank in less than one minute, her propellers still turning. Ninety of the crew were rescued from the freezing water, but 101 perished in the battle which had lasted less than 20 minutes.\nThe remains of \"Norge\" lie at a depth of about , in the middle of Narvik harbour. Partly salvaged in situ, it is considered a war memorial and diving on the wreck is prohibited.\n\n"}

These fleets attacked Japan in 1274 and again in 1281.. Due to the growth of Zen Buddhism among Samurai at the time, these were the first events where the typhoons were described as \"divine wind\" as much by their timing as by their force. Since Man'yōshū, the word \"kamikaze\" has been used as a \"Makurakotoba\" of waka introducing Ise Grand Shrine.\n\nThe latter fleet, composed of \"more than four thousand ships bearing nearly 140,000 men\" is said to have been the largest attempted naval invasion in history whose scale was only recently eclipsed in modern times by the D-Day invasion of allied forces into Normandy in 1944.\n\nIn the first invasion, the Mongols successfully conquered the Japanese settlements on Tsushima and Iki islands. When they landed on Hakata Bay, however, they met fierce resistance by the armies of samurai clans and were forced to withdraw to their bases in China. In the midst of the withdrawal, they were hit by a typhoon. Most of their ships sank and many soldiers drowned.\n\nThe first incident took place in autumn 1274 when a Mongol fleet of 500 to 900 ships carrying 30,000 to 40,000 men attacked Japan. While in Hakata Bay, Kyushu, a typhoon hit the fleet. An estimated 13,000 men drowned, around one-third of the ships sank, and the rest were damaged.\n\nDuring the time period between the first and second invasion, the Japanese prudently built two-meter-high walls to protect themselves from future assaults.\n\nSeven years later, the Mongols returned. Unable to find any suitable landing beaches due to the walls, the fleet stayed afloat for months and depleted their supplies as they searched for an area to land. After months of being exposed to the elements, the fleet was destroyed by a great typhoon, which the Japanese called \"kamikaze\" (divine wind). The Mongols never attacked Japan again, and more than 70,000 men were said to have been captured.\n\nThe second fleet was larger, comprising two forces with an estimated total of 4,400 ships and 140,000 men; greatly outnumbering the Japanese soldiers (who had an estimated 40,000 samurai and other fighting men). The typhoon led to the death of at least half the men, and only a few hundred vessels survived. Following the storm, most survivors were killed by the Japanese. This event is considered \"one of the largest and most disastrous attempts at a naval invasion in history.\"\n\nIn popular Japanese myths at the time, the god Raijin was the god who turned the storms against the Mongols. Other variations say that the gods Fūjin, Ryūjin or Hachiman caused the destructive kamikaze.\n\nThe name given to the storm, \"kamikaze\", was later used during World War II as nationalist propaganda for suicide attacks by Japanese pilots. The metaphor meant that the pilots were to be the \"Divine Wind\" that would again sweep the enemy from the seas. This use of \"kamikaze\" has come to be the common meaning of the word in English.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2225578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2225578", "title": "State Peace and Development Council", "text": "State Peace and Development Council\n\nThe State Peace and Development Council ( ;\nabbreviated to SPDC or , ) was the official name of the military government of Burma, which seized power under the rule of Saw Maung in 1988. On 30 March 2011, Senior General and Council Chairman Than Shwe signed a decree that officially dissolved the Council.\n\nFrom 1988 to 1997, the SPDC was known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), which had replaced the Burma Socialist Programme Party. In 1997, SLORC was abolished and reconstituted as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). The powerful regional military commanders, who were members of SLORC, were promoted to new positions and transferred to the capital of Rangoon (now Yangon). The new regional military commanders were not included in the membership of the SPDC.\n\nThe SPDC consisted of eleven senior military officers. The members of the junta wielded a great deal more power than the cabinet ministers, who were either more-junior military officers or civilians. The exception was the Defence Ministry portfolio, which was in the hands of junta leader Than Shwe himself. On 15 September 1993, it established the Union Solidarity and Development Association which was replaced by Union Solidarity and Development Party in 29 March 2010 in time for the elections.\n\nAlthough the regime retreated from the totalitarian Burmese Way to Socialism of BSPP when it took power in 1988, the regime was widely accused of human rights abuses. It rejected the 1990 election results and kept Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest until her release on 13 November 2010. The council was officially dissolved on 30 March 2011, with the inauguration of the newly elected government, led by its former member and Prime Minister, President Thein Sein.\n\nSLORC was formed when the Burmese Armed Forces, commanded by General Saw Maung (later self-promoted to 'Senior General' Saw Maung, died July 1997), seized power on 18 September 1988 crushing the 'Four Eights Uprising'. On the day it seized power SLORC issued Order No.1/1988 stating that the Armed Forces had taken over power and announced the formation of the SLORC. With Order No. 2/1988, the SLORC abolished all 'Organs of State Power' that were formed under the 1974 Burmese constitution. The Pyithu Hluttaw (the legislature under the 1974 Constitution), the Council of Ministers (the Cabinet), the Council of People's Justices (the Judiciary), the Council of People's Attorneys (the 'Attorney-General Office'), the Council of People's Inspectors (the 'Auditor-General Office'), as well as the State/Region, Township, Ward/Village People's Councils were abolished.\n\nThe SLORC also stated that the services of the Deputy Ministers in the previous Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP) government which it replaced were also terminated. (Under the 1974 Burmese Constitution the 'Council of Ministers' acted as a Cabinet but since the Deputy Ministers were not considered to be formally part of the Council of Ministers, the SLORC made sure that the Deputy Ministers – together with the Ministers' – services in the previous BSPP government from whom it had taken over power were also terminated.) The Orders that SLORC issued on the day of its takeover can be seen in the 19 September 1988 issue of \"The Working People's Daily\". The first Chairman of SLORC was General Saw Maung, later Senior General, who was also the Prime Minister. He was removed as both Chairman of SLORC and Prime Minister on 23 April 1992 when General Than Shwe, later Senior General, took over both posts from him.\n\nOn 15 November 1997, SLORC was abolished and reconstituted as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). Most but not all members of the abolished SLORC were in the SPDC military regime.\n\nOrdered by protocol:\n\nWestern non-governmental organisations, such as the Burma Campaign UK, the US Campaign for Burma, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have made a variety of serious accusations against the SPDC. Reports by these organisations as well as the United Nations and the Karen Human Rights Group alleged gross human rights abuses that took place in Burma under their regime, including:\n\nOne of the worst atrocities in Burma took place during the uprising of August 1988, when millions of Burmese marched throughout the country calling for an end to military rule. Soldiers shot hundreds of protesters and killed an estimated 3,000 people in the following weeks. During the August and September demonstrations of 2007, at least 184 protesters were shot and killed and many were tortured. Under the SPDC, the Burmese army engaged in military offensives against ethnic minority populations, committing acts that violated international humanitarian law.\n\nIt has been alleged that the SPDC forcibly recruited children – some as young as 10 – to serve in its army, the Tatmadaw. It is difficult to estimate the number of child soldiers used to serve in the Burmese army, but there were thousands, according to Human Rights Watch the Child Soldiers Global Report 2008 and Amnesty International.\n\nThe UN Secretary-General named the SPDC in four consecutive reports for violating international standards prohibiting the recruitment and use of child soldiers.\nChildren and Armed Conflict, Report of the Secretary-General, 26 October 2006 UN Doc. A/61/529 S2006/826.\n\nReport of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict in\nMyanmar to the Security Council, 16 November 2007, UN Doc.

A/62/609-S/2007/757.\n\nReport of the Secretary-General on children and armed\nconflict in Myanmar 1 June 2009 UN Doc. S/2009/278 \n\nHuman Rights Watch reported that since Cyclone Nargis in May 2008, the Burmese authorities expelled hundreds, if not thousands, of displaced persons from schools, monasteries, and public buildings, and encouraged them to return to their destroyed villages in the Irrawaddy Delta. The authorities emptied some public buildings and schools to use as polling stations for the 24 May referendum on a new constitution, despite pleas from United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to postpone the referendum and focus their resources on humanitarian relief. The SPDC was alleged to have evicted people from dozens of government-operated tented relief camps in the vicinity of the former capital Yangon, ordering the residents to return to their homes, regardless of the conditions they face.\n\nThe forced evictions were part of government efforts to demonstrate that the emergency relief period was over and that the affected population were capable of rebuilding their lives without foreign aid. People who were forced from their homes by Cyclone Nargis are considered to be internally displaced persons under international law. Under the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, the Burmese government was urged to ensure the right of \"internally displaced persons to return voluntarily, in safety and with dignity, to their homes or places of habitual residence, or to resettle voluntarily in another part of the country.\"\n\nAccording to the International Labour Organization (ILO), despite the new quasi-civilian government taking power in Burma, forced labour continues to be widespread in Burma. It is imposed mainly by the military, for 'portering' (that is, carrying of provisions to remote bases, or on military operations), road construction, camp construction and repair, and for a range of other tasks. In March 1997, the European Union withdrew Burma's trade privileges because of the prevalence of forced labour and other abuses. The same year, the ILO established a Commission of Inquiry to look into allegations of forced labour, coming up with a damning report the following year.\n\nIn November 2006, the International Labour Organization (ILO) announced it was to seek at the International Criminal Court \"to prosecute members of the ruling Myanmar junta for crimes against humanity\" over the allegations of forced labour of its citizens by the military. According to the ILO, an estimated 800,000 people are subject to forced labour in Burma.\n\nEven before the large-scale demonstrations began in August 2007, the authorities arrested many well-known opponents of the government on political grounds, several of whom had only been released from prison several months earlier. Before the 25–29 September crackdown, more arrests of members of the opposition party National League for Democracy (NLD) took place, which critics say was a pre-emptive measure before the crackdown.\n\nMass round-ups occurred during the crackdown itself, and the authorities continued to arrest protesters and supporters throughout 2007. Between 3,000 and 4,000 political prisoners were detained, including children and pregnant women, 700 of whom were believed still in detention at year's end. At least 20 were charged and sentenced under anti-terrorism legislation in proceedings which did not meet international fair trial standards. Detainees and defendants were denied the right to legal counsel.\n\n"}

He was instrumental in the process which produced the first British military academy and staff college; and he saw active service in the French Revolutionary Wars and the Peninsular War until his death at the Battle of Salamanca.\n\nLe Marchant was born in Amiens to a French mother and Guernsey father, who both came from old and prominent families. The Le Marchants were an extremely distinguished family in Guernsey, formerly part of the Duchy of Normandy, with many of his ancestors holding the positions of Bailiff or Lieutenant-Bailiff of Guernsey. His father, John Le Marchant, was a Cornet in the Royal Dragoons who attended Pembroke College, Oxford, and served with distinction under the Marquess of Granby during the last three campaigns of the Seven Years' War. His mother, Marie Catherine, was the eldest daughter of Count Hirzel de Saint-Gratien and a descendant of the celebrated French Protestant leader Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, from whom Le Marchant derived his middle name.\n\nLe Marchant was born at his maternal grandfather's house in Amiens. He had a younger brother, James. After leaving Dr Morgan's school in Bath characterised as \"one of the two greatest dunces that had ever been there\" (the other being Sir Sidney Smith), Le Marchant reformed his character and was commissioned in a regiment of the Wiltshire Militia. He later, in 1783, transferred to the regular army and obtained an ensigncy in the 1st Regiment of Foot (The Royal Regiment or Royal Scots). A few years of duty in Ireland and Gibraltar followed and he then made his move into the cavalry, being commissioned into the 6th Dragoons (Iniskillings). In the autumn of 1789 Le Marchant was promoted to lieutenant in the 2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays), and in 1791 he was promoted to captain and command of a troop.\n\nLe Marchant served as a brigade major during the disastrous Low Countries campaign of 1793-95, and for a time had command of his regiment as the most senior officer present. His practical experience in the field brought to Le Marchant's attention the many deficiencies of equipment and training the British cavalry suffered from. He was impressed by the Austrian cavalry who were operating alongside the British, and was particularly struck by the disparaging remark of an Austrian officer who thought that the British swordsmanship was \"most entertaining\" but reminded him of \"someone chopping wood\".\n\nOn his return to Britain he exerted himself to improve the equipment and combat training of the British cavalry. In 1795-6 he designed, in collaboration with the Birmingham sword cutler Henry Osborn, a new cavalry sabre, which was adopted for the light cavalry. In 1796 his treatise of instruction in mounted swordsmanship was adopted by the army as part of its official regulations (The Rules and Regulations of the Sword Exercise of the Cavalry). The sword exercise became quite celebrated, the elderly king, George III, became familiar with it, and country lanes abounded with small boys practising the cuts with sticks. Le Marchant toured Britain teaching cadres, drawn from both regular and yeomanry cavalry units, his system of swordsmanship; his methods were practical and painstaking and he was himself a superb mounted swordsman. Le Marchant was also to have gone to Ireland to teach his sword exercise there but was prevented from doing so, his brother-in-law, Lt. Peter Carey (16th Light Dragoons), undertook this duty in his stead.\nLe Marchant attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel in 1797. His promotion was at the direct behest of the king (Le Marchant lacked the family influence and wealth which was normally necessary for advances in rank), with whom Le Marchant had developed a friendly relationship.\n\nAfter his promotion he served as second-in-command of the 7th Light Dragoons which Henry, Lord Paget commanded. Paget, as the Earl of Uxbridge, was later to command the Anglo-allied cavalry at the Battle of Waterloo. Though a good relationship existed between himself and Paget, Le Marchant found it difficult to keep company with the immensely wealthy and fashionable peer. He therefore transferred to his old regiment the 2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays), becoming the regimental commander.\n\nWith the exception of the specialist instruction school for artillery and engineer officers at Woolwich no institution for the education of military officers existed in Britain. In 1801, after overcoming considerable opposition on the grounds of cost, Le Marchant's scheme for establishing the High Wycombe and Great Marlow schools for the military instruction of officers was sanctioned by Parliament, and a grant of £30,000 was voted for the foundation of a Royal Military College, the two original departments being afterwards combined and removed to a purpose-built Royal Military College at Sandhurst. The military schools had two functions; first was in the instruction of serving officers in the functions of the efficient staff-officer, and second was the schooling of youngsters before they gained an officer's commission. Le Marchant was the first lieutenant-governor of the college, and during the nine years that he held this appointment he trained many officers who served with distinction under Wellington in the Peninsular War. It is notable that a number of senior serving officers, such as General Robert Ballard Long, attended courses at the college in order to improve their military knowledge. This college was one of the forerunners of the current Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, created in 1947. In 1804 Le Marchant received the personal thanks of King George III, who said \"The country is greatly indebted to you\".\n\nHaving been promoted to major-general Le Marchant was given the command of a brigade of heavy cavalry in 1811, and greatly distinguished himself in several actions. In the cavalry clash at Villagarcia, 11 April 1812, Le Marchant led the 5th Dragoon Guards in a perfectly timed flank charge, in echelon of squadrons, which defeated two strong columns of French cavalry under General Charles Lallemand. The French had been attacking British light cavalry under Sir Stapleton Cotton, who were being forced to give ground.\n\nHe gained his greatest success as a cavalry commander at the Battle of Salamanca on 22 July 1812, where he was killed. During the development of the Anglo-Portuguese attack on the over-extended French left wing Wellington is reported as saying to Le Marchant that he must take the first favourable opportunity to engage the enemy's infantry, \"You must then charge at all hazards\" was his final instruction. Following up the attack of the 5th Infantry Division Le Marchant led the 3rd and 4th Dragoons and the 5th Dragoon Guards in what was probably the most destructive charge made by a single brigade of cavalry in the whole Napoleonic period. The left wing of the French army were on the point of being defeated by the 3rd and 5th divisions of Anglo-Portuguese infantry when Le Marchant's dragoons charged in and destroyed battalion after battalion. Many of the French infantrymen sought the protection of the British infantry to escape the sabres of the dragoons. Le Marchant, knowing he had achieved a magnificent success, was leading a squadron against the last of the formed French infantry when he was shot and his spine broken.\n\nWellington's despatch after the battle stated: \"the cavalry under Lieutenant-General Sir Stapleton Cotton made a most gallant and successful charge against a body of the enemy's infantry, which they overthrew and cut to pieces. In this charge Major-General Le Marchant was killed at the head of his brigade, and I have to lament the loss of a most able officer\".\n\nLe Marchant was responsible for a considerable improvement in the practical abilities of the British army on campaign. His sword exercise undoubtedly augmented the combat capabilities of the British cavalry. The military college produced many able staff officers, collectively known as \"Wycombites,\" who went on to serve in important staff positions in the Peninsular War and the Waterloo Campaign. He also introduced the idea that officers should be formally trained in their duties rather than having to pick up the rudiments of their profession on active service.\n\nLe Marchant was liked and admired by many in his profession, soldier and officer alike. The Duke of York, the commander-in-chief of the British Army, is said to have wept when he was told of Le Marchant's death.\n\nHe wrote several treatises on cavalry tactics and other military subjects, most published semi-anonymously (the ones adopted as army regulations were not officially ascribed to a single author). These included \"Rules and Regulations of the Sword Exercise\" and \"The Duties of Officers on the Outpost\". His treatise \"An Outline of the General Staff of the Army\" was presented to the Duke of York in 1802. Its recommendations were not taken up in their entirety, but several of his suggestions were, such as the setting up of a \"Staff Corps\"; such a corps played an invaluable role in the functioning of the British Army during the Peninsular War.\n\nJohn Le Marchant was buried on the field of battle, however, a monument to him was erected in St Paul's Cathedral, London.\n\nFort Le Marchant on the north coast of Guernsey is named for him.\n\nHe married, on 29 October 1789, Mary daughter of John Carey of Guernsey. All accounts suggest that Le Marchant was a devoted husband and father. Mary Le Marchant pre-deceased her husband, dying in childbirth in 1811. Le Marchant had four sons and six daughters. Two of his sons, Sir Denis Le Marchant, 1st Baronet, and John Le Marchant, gained public distinction. His eldest son, Carey, who was prominent at the storming of San Sebastián, died of a wound at Saint-Jean-de-Luz during the latter part of the Peninsular War. The children were left orphans at the death of their father and a yearly public pension of £1200 was awarded to them. The younger children were placed in the care of an aunt.\n\n\n\n"}

Of all the non-neutral powers, only the GDP of the United Kingdom had not decreased because of the war, Germany's GDP was at its 1908 level and France's at its 1891 level. Trade was based on US dollar reserves (the only acceptable reserve currency), which Europe lacked. Therefore, the transfer of money (immediately after each transaction) increased the opportunity cost of trading. Some trade was reduced to barter. The situation led the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC) to create the EPU, all members signing the agreement on 1 July 1950. The EPU accounted for trades but did not transfer money until the end of the month. It changed the landscape from bilateral trades of necessity (trading with partners because of outstanding debts) to multilateral trades. The EPU also forced liberalization by mandating that members eliminate discriminatory trade measures. The EPU was a general success with trade levels more than doubling during its existence. By its close in 1958, convertibility of currency was a possibility, no longer needing government permissions in European countries.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2225599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2225599", "title": "Shuttle Training Aircraft", "text": "Shuttle Training Aircraft\n\nThe Shuttle Training Aircraft (STA) was a NASA training vehicle that duplicated the Space Shuttle's approach profile and handling qualities, allowing Space Shuttle pilots to simulate Shuttle landings under controlled conditions before attempting the task on board the orbiter. The STA was also flown to assess weather conditions just prior to Space Shuttle launches and landings.\n\nNASA developed the STA using the Grumman Gulfstream II as the underlying aircraft platform. During the early phases of the Shuttle program, NASA considered using the Boeing 737 airliner as the basis for the STA, but rejected it due to cost and opted for the less-expensive Gulfstream II.\n\nThe aircraft's exterior was modified to withstand the high aerodynamic forces incurred during training sorties. A redesigned cockpit provided a high-fidelity simulation of the Shuttle Orbiter's controls and pilot vantage point; even the seats were fitted in the same position as those in the Space Shuttle.\n\nThe four STAs were normally located at the NASA Forward Operating Location in El Paso, Texas and rotated through Ellington Field (Houston, Texas) for maintenance. The STA was also used at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It was primarily flown by astronauts practicing landings at the Shuttle Landing Facility and White Sands Space Harbor as well as to assess weather conditions prior to Space Shuttle launches and landings.\n\nOn December 3, 2003, a NASA Gulfstream II Shuttle Training Aircraft (STA) was flying a series of simulated shuttle landings to the Kennedy Space Center shuttle landing facility. On board the aircraft was an unidentified NASA astronaut pilot and two training personnel. The aircraft was on final approach at 13,000 feet when onboard instruments indicated a malfunction on one of the jet engine thrust reversers. The aircraft landed safely. A post-landing inspection showed that one of the 585-pound, 4-foot-wide, 5-foot-long thrust reversers had fallen off the aircraft. Divers later found the thrust reverser on the bottom of the nearby Banana River. An investigation showed that a bolt failed, releasing the part from the aircraft.\n\nThe STA was particularly critical for Shuttle pilots in training because the Orbiter lacked atmospheric engines that would allow the craft to \"go around\" after a poor approach. After re-entry, the Shuttle was a very heavy glider (it was affectionately referred to as a 'flying brick') and as such had only one chance to land successfully.\nTo match the descent rate and drag profile of the real Shuttle at , the main landing gear of the C-11A was lowered (the nose gear stayed retracted due to wind load constraints) and engine thrust was reversed. Its flaps could deflect upwards to decrease lift as well as downwards to increase lift.\n\nCovers were placed on the left hand cockpit windows to provide the same view as from a Shuttle cockpit, and the left-hand pilot's seat was fitted with the same controls as a Shuttle. The STA's normal flight controls were moved to the right, where the instructor sat. Both seat positions had a head-up display (HUD).\n\nIn a normal exercise, the pilot descended to at an airspeed of , from the landing target. The pilot then rolled the STA at , from landing. The nose of the aircraft was then dropped to increase speed to , descending at a 20-degree angle on the outer glide slope (OGS). The outer glide slope aiming point was short of the runway threshold, and used PAPIs for visual guidance in addition to the MLS system. At the guidance system changed to pre-flare and shortly after, at , the pilot started the flare maneuver to gradually reduce the descent angle and transition to the inner glide slope (IGS) which was 1.5 degrees from onwards, using a \"ball-bar\" system for visual guidance. The shuttle landing gear release was simulated at above the ground, since the STA main gear remained down for the whole simulation. The nose gear of the STA was lowered at AGL in case of an inadvertent touchdown with the runway surface.\n\nIf the speed was correct, a green light on the instrument panel simulated shuttle landing when the pilot's eyes were above the runway. This was the exact position that the pilot's head would be in during an actual landing. In the exercise, the STA was still flying above the ground. The instructor pilot deselected the simulation mode, stowed the thrust reversers, and the instructor executed a \"go-around\", never actually landing the aircraft (on training approaches).\n\nA sophisticated computer system installed on board the STA simulated the flight dynamics of the orbiter with nearly perfect accuracy.

From 1992 to 2004 he was the president of the international Traditionalist Catholic organisation \"Foederatio Internationalis\" Una Voce and was responsible for the unification of \"Una Voce America\".\n\nDavies was born to Cyril and Annie (née Garnworthy) Davies. His father, a Welshman, was a Baptist, and his mother, who was English, was an Anglican. Davies was brought up in Yeovil, Somerset, but proud of his Welsh descent. He served as a regular soldier in the Somerset Light Infantry during the Malayan Emergency, the Suez Crisis, and the EOKA campaign in Cyprus.\n\nDavies was a Baptist who converted to Catholicism while still a student in the 1950s. While initially a supporter of the Second Vatican Council, Davies became critical of the liturgical changes that followed in its wake, which he argued were a result of distortions and misreadings of the Council's mandates for liturgical reform.\nDavies later supported the French Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, founder of the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX), writing a three-volume series titled \"Apologia Pro Marcel Lefebvre\" in which he defended Lefebvre against accusations of disobedience and schism for refusing to celebrate the Mass of Paul VI. Although Davies opposed Lefebvre's canonically-illicit consecration of four SSPX bishops in 1988 against the wishes of Pope John Paul II, he continued to publicly support Lefebvre's defence of the Tridentine Mass and traditional Church teachings.\n\nWilliam D. Dinges, Professor of Religion and Culture at The Catholic University of America, described Davies as \"[i]nternationally, one of the most prolific traditionalist apologists\".\n\nDavies was a critic of the alleged apparitions of the Blessed Virgin at Medjugorje, which he believed to be false.\n\nDavies died on 25 September 2004, aged 68, following a battle with cancer and was buried in the churchyard of St. Mary's, Chislehurst, Kent. He was survived by his wife, Marija, one daughter and two sons, one of whom is the barrister Adrian Davies.\n\n\n"}

Built by Armstrong Whitworth at Newcastle on Tyne in 1899, she was obsolete when sunk by German torpedoes in Narvik harbour on 9 April 1940 during the German invasion of Norway (Operation Weserübung).\n\n\"Eidsvold\" was built as part of the general rearmament in the time leading up to the political events in 1905, and remained, along with her sister ship \"Norge\", the backbone of the Royal Norwegian Navy for just over 40 years. She was named after the town of Eidsvold, the site of the drafting and signing of the Norwegian Constitution on 17 May 1814. Considered to be quite powerful ships for their time, with two 21 cm (8.26 inch) guns as their main armament, they were soon outclassed by the new Dreadnought battleships. They were armoured to withstand battle with ships of a similar class to their own, with 6 inches (15.24 cm) of Krupp cemented armour in the belt and 9 inches (22.86 cm) of the same armour on her two turrets. \"Eidsvold\" and \"Norge\" were the largest vessels in the Royal Norwegian Navy at 4,233 tons gross and crews of up to 270 men.\n\nIt was intended to augment the Norwegian coastal defence ship fleet with the two ships of the \"Bjørgvin\"-class, ordered in 1912, but after these were confiscated by the British Royal Navy at the outbreak of World War I, the \"Eidsvold\"-class and the older, two ship strong, \"Tordenskjold\"-class was forced to soldier on long after they were obsolete.\n\nIn the morning of 9 April 1940, German forces entered Narvik harbour under cover of fog and heavy snow. Despite the weather, they were spotted by Norwegian vessels, which promptly reported the sighting and alerted \"Eidsvold\" and \"Norge\". Aboard both ships steps were taken to prepare for combat. The guns were loaded with live ammunition and life preservers issued to the crew. Around 04:15 in the morning, the Germans spotted \"Eidsvold\". Captain Odd Isaachsen Willoch aboard \"Eidsvold\" immediately ordered to signal the leading German destroyer with an Aldis lamp, and when the Germans failed to respond to the signal, he ordered a warning shot placed before their bow while he flew a two flag signal, ordering the destroyer to halt.\n\nSince the Germans had orders to occupy Norway peacefully if at all possible, the German destroyer \"Wilhelm Heidkamp\" stopped, and signalled \"Eidsvold\" that it would send an officer to negotiate. From a distance of about 200 metres, a small launch ferried Korvettenkapitän Gerlach over to \"Eidsvold\". Gerlach and a signalman were received on the aft deck of \"Eidsvold\" by the second in command, and were taken to the bridge to speak to Captain Willoch. At the same time, the gun crews aboard \"Eidsvold\" kept the German destroyer in their sights, both the 21 cm guns and the 15 cm guns. Due to the short distance, the trajectory of the shells would have been flat, making it hard not to hit the thinly armoured vessel.\n\nAt the bridge, Gerlach tried to convince Willoch that the Germans had arrived as friends and that Willoch should surrender his ship peacefully. Willoch countered by pointing out that he was bound by duty to resist, but did ask for a ten-minute break to consider the matter. However, instead of considering surrender, Willoch used this time to contact his superiors, as well as the captain of \"Norge\", informing them of his intent to attack the German forces. While this was going on, another German destroyer had crossed behind \"Eidsvold\" and took up a position from the vessel, ready to fire her torpedoes.\n\nGerlach tried once again to convince Willoch to surrender, but was turned down a second time. As he left the deck of \"Eidsvold\", he fired a red flare, indicating that the Norwegians wished to fight. At this point, Captain Willoch hurried towards the bridge, while shouting \"\"På plass ved kanonene. Nå skal vi slåss, gutter!\"\" (\"Man the guns. We're gonna fight, boys!\"). \"Eidsvold\" turned towards the closest destroyer and accelerated, while the battery commander ordered the port battery (three 15 cm guns) to open fire. However, the Germans - afraid \"Eidsvold\" might ram the destroyer - fired four torpedoes at the old coastal defence ship.\n\nTwo or three of the torpedoes hit before the port guns could fire, according to Norwegian sources: one under the rear turret, one midship and one in the bow. It is likely that the torpedoes ignited one of the magazines aboard, because \"Eidsvold\" was blown in two and sunk in seconds, propellers still turning. Only six of the crew were rescued, while 175 died in the freezing water.\n\nSome remains of \"Eidsvold\" lie in shallow waters at the entrance to Narvik harbour. Mostly salvaged in situ, only minor remains are left of the ship.\n\n"}

The organization argues that while the Second Vatican Council had introduced vernacular liturgies, it did not actually forbid the Latin Mass, and that regular weekday and Sunday Masses in Latin should be maintained. The organization also seeks to promote Latin Gregorian Chant, sacred polyphony and sacred art. Unlike some of the other Catholic traditionalist organizations, Una Voce seeks to remain faithful to the Pope within the Catholic Church, and asserts that the Tridentine and the vernacular masses should be allowed to co-exist. Among its prominent early members were the composers Maurice Duruflé and Olivier Messiaen.\n\nA number of national associations developed during 1964 and 1965, and in 1966 an international association, the \"Foederatio Internationalis Una Voce\" was formed. It currently has over two dozen national affiliates.\n\nFIUV members value the traditional Latin Mass as direct link with the early Church and for conveying the mystery and majesty of God, but have been critiqued for elitism and for its emphasis on private religious devotion. The group has been described as an \"arch-conservative\" organization by Episcopal Church organist James E Frazier. Traditionalist Catholics usually uphold orthodox Catholic moral teaching on abortion, contraception and marriage. However, members of the FIUV reject comparisons to fundamentalism.\n\nFIUV was enthusiastic about the election of Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger as the Pope in 2005. He took the name of Benedict XVI. He had spoken at a conference, and had praised FIUV's role in supporting the use of the Roman Missal within the guidelines set out by the Vatican. The organization's influence at the highest levels of the Vatican has led to the authorization of the Tridentine Mass without specific permission or indult by local bishops, and the wider implementation of the motu proprio, \"Summorum Pontificum\".\n\nThe International Federation represents 41 member associations in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Colombia, Croatia, Cuba, Czech Republic, England and Wales, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Russia, Scotland, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine and the USA.

The team was a member of the United Soccer Leagues Premier Development League (PDL), the fourth tier of the American Soccer Pyramid, until 2006, when the team left the league and the franchise was terminated.\n\nThe Blizzard played their home games at Sand Creek Stadium in the city of Colorado Springs, Colorado and also in the stadium at Harrison High School, also in Colorado Springs. The team's colors were red and white.\n\n\"vs Kansas City Brass, 23 July 2006\"\n\nBlizzard entered the PDL as an expansion franchise in 2004 as the third team from the Pikes Peak area to play in the league, following the runs of the Colorado Springs Stampede (1995–2000) and Colorado Springs Ascent (2001). Under owner/head coach Bill Arbogast Blizzard's first season in competition began strongly with back-to-back wins in their first two games, 4–0 over Kansas City Brass and 4–3 over state rivals Boulder Rapids Reserve, with Sean McGinnis and Daniel Wasson finding the net. This was as good as the season got, as they struggled to find consistency thereafter. They remained potent in front of goal throughout the year – they beat St. Louis Strikers 5–3 (with McGinnis scoring a hat trick), overpowered Sioux Falls Spitfire 4–1 in mid-June, and enjoyed an excellent 5–0 win on the road in St. Louis in July. This was counteracted by several heavy defeats, including a 6–2 hammering by BYU Cougars, a 4–1 defeat to Boulder Rapids Reserve, a 4–0 thrashing on the road at the El Paso Patriots, and two 3–0 losses on the end of season run in. Blizzard finished their first campaign 7th in the Heartland Division, 35 points adrift of divisional champions Chicago Fire Premier.\n\nThe 2005 season was a struggle for Blizzard; they dropped their opening three games of the season by significant margins, and left it late to pick up their first win 3–1 at home to Sioux Falls Spitfire at the end of May. However, this victory did not signal a turnaround in fortunes: they lost five of their next six games, beating expansion side Springfield Storm 3–1, but suffering heavy defeats to El Paso Patriots (3–0), Boulder Rapids Reserve (5–1) and BYU Cougars (6–2). Blizzard's fourth and final win of the season came at home in mid-July with a 3–1 victory over Kansas City Brass, but slumped to four consecutive losses in their final four games, including a 6–1 demolition by Boulder Rapids Reserve, and a humiliating 5–0 defeat by Des Moines Menace on the last day of the season. They finished the year 6th in the Heartland Division, 26 points off the leaders and just three points off the basement. Top scorer Ryan Regrutto did manage to hit 5 goals, while Craig Miller contributed 3 assists.\n\nJohn Wells was brought in as head coach for the 2006 season. The team won just three games all season—3–0 over Sioux Falls Spitfire in mid-June, 4–3 over expansion franchise Ogden Outlaws in early July, and 2–0 over fellow Utah team BYU Cougars. This was as good as it got for Blizzard: most of the rest of the season was spent enduring a series of heavy defeats, including a 4–1 thrashing at home by Des Moines Menace, a 6–1 demolition at the hands of Colorado Rapids U23's, a 3–1 loss on the road in Sioux Falls, and a 1–0 loss to Kansas City Brass on the final day of the season in what turned out to be the franchise's last ever game. Blizzard finished 2006 6th in the Heartland Division for the second consecutive year, three points ahead of Thunder Bay Chill, but 30 behind divisional champions Colorado. Joel Trainer was Blizzard's top scorer, with 7 goals, while Ryan Regrutto and Craig Miller both contributed 3 assists. Following the conclusion of the 2006 season the club folded, and left the PDL. The Blizzards season was capped off by a 2 win road trip in Utah which is a tuff Road Trip and getting 2 wins on the Road the same weekend in the PDL is rare. The Road trip was on the heels of a Wednesday night match with the Colorado Rapids at Sand Creek Stadium. Coach Fernando Clavijo and John Murphy arrived with the Rapids to play in front of a crowd of about 2,000 to watch the Blizzard come away with a 3–2 win which would prove to be the highlight of the Blizzards 2006 season.\n\n\n\n"}

She directed the films \"Monster\" (2003), \"Wonder Woman\" (2017), and the upcoming \"Wonder Woman 1984\" (2020). For her work on the pilot episode of \"The Killing\", she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series and won the Directors Guild of America award for Outstanding Directing in Dramatic Series.\n\nJenkins was born in Victorville, California, to William T. Jenkins, an Air Force captain and fighter pilot who earned a Silver Star in the Vietnam War, and Emily Roth, who worked in San Francisco as an environmental scientist. She has an older sister, Elaine Roth.\n\nWhen Jenkins was 7, her father died during a NATO mock dogfight at the age of 31. Her mother then took her and her sister to San Francisco so that Jenkins could go to school to become an environmental scientist. There, Jenkins said in 2017, seeing the original \"Superman\" starring Christopher Reeve inspired her to pursue film as a career.\n\nShe spent kindergarten through her junior year of high school living in Lawrence, Kansas. She received her undergraduate degree from The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in 1993, and her masters in directing from the American Film Institute's AFI Conservatory in 2000. While a student at AFI, Jenkins, an avid fan of the films of Pedro Almodóvar, made the 2001 short film \"Velocity Rules\", that she describes as a cross between a superhero film and Almodóvar's tone about an accident-prone housewife.\n\nBeginning in junior high school, Jenkins took interest in photography, painting, and screen-printing. At age 20, while interning at a commercial production company, she heeded a suggestion that she could receive film training if she worked on set for free. After doing so for some months, Jenkins advanced to second assistant camera and focus puller, then spent 10 years as a cameraperson. While shooting a Michael Jackson music video, her director of photography recommended she attends the American Film Institute to learn directing. She later made a superhero short film that played the AFI Fest. There she met Brad Wyman, who later introduced her to producer Donald Kushner, leading to her directing her first feature film, \"Monster\" (2003).\n\nAfter \"Monster\", about serial killer Aileen Wuornos, proved a critical and commercial success, Jenkins was approached by former United States Air Force test pilot Chuck Yeager to develop a film about his life. When that project did not reach fruition, she attempted to make a Ryan Gosling movie titled \"I Am Superman\", a film with no relation to the DC Comics character, but development ended when she became pregnant. Jenkins spent the next decade working in television.\n\nIn 2011 she directed one segment in the made-for-television anthology film \"Five\". In October 2011, she was hired to direct \"\", the first sequel to \"Thor\", but left the project after less than two months over creative differences. In 2014, she was attached to \"Sweetheart\", a film about a female assassin, but that film was never made. In 2015, Jenkins signed on as director for the DC Extended Universe film \"Wonder Woman\", with a screenplay by Allan Heinberg and a story co-written by Heinberg, Zack Snyder and Jason Fuchs. \"Wonder Woman\" was released in June 2017 and gave Jenkins the biggest domestic opening for a female director, surpassing previous record holder \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" by Sam Taylor-Johnson. With this film, Jenkins also became the first female director of an American studio superhero movie. \"Wonder Woman\" eventually became the highest-grossing film directed by a woman, surpassing previous record holder \"Mamma Mia!\" by Phyllida Lloyd.\nWhile promoting \"Wonder Woman\", Jenkins mentioned that her next project would likely be a limited television series developed with her husband. This project was later revealed as a horror series titled \"Riprore\" to premiere on the video-on-demand service Shudder. In July 2017, the US cable network TNT announced Jenkins would direct the premiere of a six-episode television drama, \"I Am the Night\", written by her author husband Sam Sheridan and featuring her \"Wonder Woman\" star Chris Pine. She additionally will serve as an executive producer.\n\nIn September 2017, \"Variety\" reported Jenkins would return to direct \"Wonder Woman 2\". On December 6, 2017, Jenkins was named by \"Time\" magazine as a runner-up for the Time Person of the Year. \"Wonder Woman 1984\" is scheduled to be released by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States on June 5, 2020. It had originally been scheduled for November 1, 2019. She has been negotiating the terms of her contract with Warner Brothers for an estimated 7 to 9 million dollars, which will be a record breaking salary for a female filmmaker. She signed on to the first film with no guarantee of directing a second film, but envisioned the second one during the making of Wonder Woman, which turned out to benefit her greatly. When she was signed on to do the second film, she had the ability to get a much higher salary than she would have if she had been signed on to do both films from the beginning. Her goal with her negotiations were to make sure she would get the same salary that her male counterparts would be getting for doing this movie and she seems to have succeeded.\n\nJenkins, \"Wonder Woman\" actresses Gal Gadot and Lynda Carter, DC Entertainment President Diane Nelson, and U.N. Under-Secretary General Cristina Gallach appeared at the United Nations on October 21, 2016, the 75th anniversary of the first appearance of Wonder Woman, to mark the character's designation by the United Nations as its \"Honorary Ambassador for the Empowerment of Women and Girls\". The gesture was intended to raise awareness of UN Sustainable Development Goal No. 5, which seeks to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls by 2030. The decision was met with protests from UN staff members who stated in their petition to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that the character is \"not culturally encompassing or sensitive\", and served to objectify women. As a result, the character was stripped of the designation, and the project ended December 16.\n\nIn the film \"Monster\", she explored the issues of morality and feminity. In \"Wonder Woman\", Jenkins suggests that the audience experiences the journey of the lead character Diana Prince through Diana's eyes. Diana is portrayed as the universal human character who the audiences never experience from the outside. Jenkins suggests that the major theme of the film is the idea of there being no other villain, but humans themselves. She mentions how she was influenced by \"Superman\" and how that is incorporated in her own superhero film.\n\nSome of Jenkins' mentors and influencers includes Gary Ross, Kathryn Bigelow and Steve Perry. She mentions that she often likes to discuss the process of making music with musicians like Steve. The organization and structure of music, according to Jenkins, has a lot of parallels to theater and drama. She uses this rhythm, as a director, to direct the delivery of dialogues.\n\nIn 2007, Jenkins married Sam Sheridan, a former firefighter and the author of the book \"A Fighter's Heart\". They have a son and live in Santa Monica, California.\n\nIn 2004, Jenkins won the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature for her work on \"Monster\" and received the Franklin J. Schaffner Alumni Medal from the American Film Institute. In 2011, Jenkins received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series for the pilot of \"The Killing\". She received two nominations at the 2012 Directors Guild of America Awards for Outstanding Directorial Achievement, one for Dramatic Series for \"The Killing\" and the other for Movies for Television/Mini-Series for \"Five\"; she won the former.\n\n"}

It is located beneath Chesed ('loving-kindness'), at the base of the \"Pillar of Mercy\" which also consists of Chochmah ('wisdom'). Netzach generally translates to 'eternity', and in the context of Kabbalah refers to 'perpetuity', 'victory', or 'endurance'.\n\nNetzach (Hebrew נצח) communicates the idea of long-suffering, strength, endurance unto completion or patience. This term appears eight times in the Hebrew scriptures and derivatives of this child root נצח from the parent root נח appear over forty times in the Hebrew text. See the following passages:\nAlso the strength (נצח) of Israel will not...\n\nI request [that] Job will be proven up to the limit (נצח); he will return above men of misfortune.\n\nYahweh, will You forget me continually (נצח)? Until when?\nWhy has my suffering been without end (נצח)?\n\nand he nursed his grudge forever(נצח).\nEnglish translations are original translations by editor Charles Williams\n\nWithin the Sefiroth, Netzach sits geometrically across from Hod. This pairing makes up the third such group, the \"tactical\" sefirot, meaning that their purpose is not inherent in themselves, but rather as a means for something else.\n\nThese sefirot mark a turning point. Whereas the first two groups of sefirot deal with God's intrinsic will, and what it is that He desires to bestow upon man, these sefirot are focused on man: What is the most appropriate way for man to receive God's message? How can God's will be implemented most effectively?\n\nNetzach refers to actions of God that are Chesed, \"kindness,\" in essence, but are presented through a prelude of harshness. Hod refers specifically to those events where the \"wicked prosper.\" It is retribution —Gevurah, \"strength/restraint,\" in essence, but presented by a prelude of pleasantness.\n\nNetzach is \"endurance,\" the fortitude, and patience to follow through on your passions. It is paired with Hod as the righteous attributes related to group interactivity, with Netzach being leadership, the ability to rally others to a cause and motivate them to act; while Hod is community, the ability to do the footwork needed to follow through on ideas and make them happen. Netzach is identified with our right (left leg or foot) when the Tree of Life is portrayed on the human form, while Hod is on our left (right leg or foot). \n\nThe angelic order of Netzach is the Elohim, the ruling Archangel of which is Haniel.\n\nNetzach is considered one of the Fruits of the Spirit in the Pauline Epistles (Romans 5:3, Galatians 5:22)\n\n"}

After attending Harrow School and studying at the University of Cambridge, he moved into evangelistic work in London. In 1886, he was appointed Arabic professor at Cambridge, but his career was cut short near Aden while in missionary work. He translated the \"Fables of Bidpaï\". He was an athlete, a champion cyclist and is described as a world cycling champion in 1878.\n\nKeith-Falconer was the third son of the Earl of Kintore and shared his childhood between the ancestral home in Scotland and Brighton on the southern English coast. In 1869, when he was 13, he succeeded in obtaining a place, through examination, at Harrow School, then in countryside north-west of London. He took notes of his lessons in shorthand, which he had taught himself.\n\nKeith-Falconer left Harrow in 1873, having acquired a tutor to teach him mathematics, studying with the Rev Lewis Hensley at his vicarage in Hitchin. As well as trigonometry and algebra and other subjects which seem not to have interested him particularly, he continued cycling and learned to sing. \"This,\" said Hensley, was \"for the promotion of the Temperance cause, to which he devoted himself by assisting in the entertainments and addresses of a Temperance Brigade of young men.\"\nKeith-Falconer went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in September 1874. He lived at 21 Market Hill until he married.\nHe finished his graduate studies with a First and began to read for honours in theological tripos.\n\nA teacher at Harrow School, E. E. Bowen, said:\n\nThe cycling historian Jim McGurn said:\n\nIt was while at Cambridge – where he was elected vice-president of the university bicycle club on 6 June 1874 – that he won his first bicycle races. In a letter to his sister-in-law on 11 November 1874, he wrote:\n\nIn 1875, he won a club race over the from Hatfield to Cambridge, and on 10 May won a race against Oxford University from St Albans to Oxford, . The following April he won a four-mile (6 km) race, described as \"the amateur championship\", at Lillie Bridge, setting a record time. On 15 May he won the Cambridge club's race at Fenner's in 3h 20m 37s.\n\nOn 11 May 1878 he won the National Cyclists' Union two-mile (3 km) championship at Stamford Bridge. It was probably this race that gave him the status of world champion. Until the creation of the International Cycling Association, the NCU's championships were considered the unofficial championships of the world.\n\nIn 1882, Keith-Falconer rode from Land's End to John o' Groats, the length of Britain, in 13 days. He rode in his last two days. His last race of importance was the amateur championship on 29 July 1882, at Crystal Palace, outside London. He won, seven minutes better than the record, in 2h 43m 58s.\n\nOn 28 May 1881, Keith-Falconer went cycle-touring through Oxford, Pangbourne and Harrow, a warm-up to his Land's End – John o'Groats ride, that started on 4 June. Riding from one end of Britain to the other was, in the 19th century, a journey of poor or unmade roads, riding a high-wheeled bicycle with precarious balance and poor brakes. It demanded good weather. When it did not come, Keith-Falconer left Penzance after four days and returned to London and Cambridge.\n\nKeith-Falconer's views on cycling were not always those shared by cyclists of lesser opportunity. On 20 August 1881 he wrote to his friend Mr Charrington, with whom he worked in the East End of London (see below):\n\nThe area outside Cambridge known as Barnwell was then a rough area inhabited largely by labourers working on the railways, of which four competing lines met in Cambridge. Others worked in the fossil beds. Robert Sinker, Keith-Falconer's biographer, said the labourers were \"mostly poor and ignorant, including even yet a large number of persons following vicious courses; and while the Gospel teaching of a band of devoted men was gradually leavening the mass, yet while the workers were slowly gaining on the task which faced them, hundreds were dying.\"\n\nKeith-Falconer threw himself with others in May 1875 into a missionary project for the area. They hired a theatre and held preaching meetings there for a month. \"All this time,\" Sinker said, \"Keith-Falconer was a steady and consistent helper of the mission, by his purse, by his personal cooperation, and we may feel sure by his prayers.\" At the end of the month, they judged their work a success and repeated the process for three and a half years at the Ragged School, in New Street. There, Sinker said:\n\nKeith-Falconer lectured this audience on Zelophehad's daughters.\n\nThe theatre in Barnwell became available in autumn 1878 and the evangelists acquired it, although outbid at the auction. Keith-Falconer was also involved in acquisition of the Great Assembly Hall in Mile End Road, in the East End of London. Here, the Tower Hamlets Mission was established. The state of the area is summarised by this account:\n\nKeith-Falconer taught himself Hebrew at Harrow and then moved on to other Semitic languages. At Cambridge he studied for a Semitic languages tripos, studying Hebrew, Arabic and Syriac. He required a deep knowledge of the Hebrew Bible. He passed.\n\nKeith-Falconer continued his study of Arabic in Germany, as much to perfect speaking German as deepen his knowledge of Arabia. He stayed at Leipzig for five months of 1881. That year he met General Gordon, who on 25 April 1881 wrote to him from Southampton:\n\nIn October, Keith-Falconer left for Assiout, 350 km from Cairo, on the Nile. It was the most distant point of the Egyptian railway. His first impressions were poor. On 20 November he wrote:\n\nOn 30 November he wrote:\n\nHe went back to Europe.\n\nIt was on returning to England that he made a second attempt on the long-distance record. He kept a diary which appeared in a newspaper in Aberdeen and in \"The London Bicycle Club Gazette\". On his first day he rode into sweeping rain near Bodmin.\n\nKeith-Falconer chose Aden for his missionary work after reading an article by General Haig, whom he went to see in London. Haig had urged the Church Missionary Society to establish a mission there. There were reports that children attending the Roman Catholic mission returned to Islam on leaving.\n\nKeith-Falconer visited Aden in November 1885 for a six-month trial. On 18 November he wrote to his mother:\n\nHe and his wife first lived near Crater Pass, overlooking Crater City. He distributed scriptures in the town and read publicly from an Arabic Bible. He then moved to Sheikh Othman, which had wells, a better climate and access to the interior by camel trails.\n\nIn November 1886 Keith-Falconer and his wife returned to Aden definitively. He had the support of the Free Church to establish an orphanage and the help of a Glasgow physician, Stewart Corwen. They lived in a house with a walled garden. Alongside it was a hut in which Corwen saw his patients. On 22 February 1887 Keith-Falconer wrote about catching malaria, which he called Aden fever:\n\nHe had repeated occurrences of malaria, speaking of \"the long spell of fever which both my wife and I have been through\", then that \"our illness has thrown us back in every way\", later that \"I have been suffering from remitting fever; for twelve weary weeks, on my back a useless invalid.\"\n\nFinally, his biographer wrote:\n\nKeith-Falconer married Gwendolen Bevan, daughter of the banker Robert Cooper Lee Bevan, in Cannes on 4 March 1884. They had their honeymoon in southern France and in Italy, where they inspected the remains of Pompeii before moving to 5 Salisbury Villas, Station Road, Cambridge.\n\nHe died in Aden after repeated bouts of malaria for which there was no cure. He was 32. A memorial church to him there opened 10 years later. He is buried in Holkat Bay cemetery. The Scottish Mission school and hospital at Sheikh Othman continued until the independence of South Yemen in 1967.\n\nThe foreword by the Rev Robert Sinker, librarian of Trinity College, Cambridge, to his biography, \"Memorials of the Hon Ion Keith-Falconer MA\" says:\n\n\n"}

Founded in 2003, the team plays in the USL Premier Development League (PDL), the fourth tier of the American Soccer Pyramid, in the Northwest Division of the Western Conference.\n\nThe team plays its home games at Bateman Park, where they have played since 2004. The team's colors are black, white and red.\n\nUntil 2007 the team was known as the Abbotsford Rangers, but changed their name prior to the 2008 season to reflect the name of their parent organization.\n\nThe Abbotsford area has long had a history of competitive developmental teams, including Abbotsford 86ers Select in 2000, Abbotsford 86ers in 1999 and Abbotsford Athletes in Action in 1998; Abbotsford Rangers joined the PDL as a 'provisional team' in 2003, playing at Rotary Stadium, but struggled on the field, losing their first eight games, and not picking up a win until mid-June when they topped Cascade Surge 3-2 off goals by Jason Jorgensen, Brad Peetoom and Spencer Schmidt. The victory sparked an unexpected 4-game winning streak which included a season's best 3-1 victory over Calgary Storm Select, but the resurgence was too little too late for the team, and the season ended with them in fourth place, and Jason Jorgensen as the top scorer.\n\n2004 saw the Rangers move into a new home at Bateman Park, and hire a new player-manager in the shape of former Hamilton Academical and Canada defender Colin Miller, who had been in the Canadian squad for the 1986 FIFA World Cup. Despite Miller's presence, Abbotsford's results did not improve greatly; they did not pick up their first win until the fourth game (2-1 over Yakima Reds), and only managed three more victories all season. Things hit an all-time low on the final day of the season with their 5-0 demolition at the hands of Cascade Surge, and they again finished way off the pace, 19 points behind champions Cascade.\n\n2005 saw Abbotsford slip even further behind their competition, finishing their season a full 29 points behind defending champions Cascade Surge in the Northwest division, with just 3 wins and 21 goals all year. Abbotsford suffered greatly on the road, losing 5-1 and 4-1 to Cascade, and didn't pick up a single point until their 2-1 victory away to Yakima Reds in mid-June. All of Abbotsford's wins were against Yakima, triumphing two more times, including a 1-0 final day victory on a goal by the consistent Jason Jorgensen. Nevertheless, Abbotsford's poor form was worrying for all involved.\nThen, quite inexplicably, everything changed in 2006. Miller's men were hot from the get-go, with an opening day tie with newcomers Tacoma F.C., and then back-to-back victories over Yakima Reds and the other Northwest newcomers, Ogden Outlaws. June saw the team embark on an unprecedented 6-game unbeaten streak, the highlight of which was a 4-0 road thumping of Cascade Surge. As the season wound down, Abbotsford were one of three teams vying for the playoffs, knowing that two victories in their final two games would take them into uncharted territory. A 4-0 triumph over Cascade - which included a hat trick from Sean Crocker - was followed by a comprehensive 3-0 win over Tacoma, and the Rangers had their first Northwest title, and were off to the playoffs. However, their post season was a short one, as they lost 3-2 to Orange County Blue Star first time out, despite being 2-0 up at half time.\n\nColin Miller left Abbotsford in the 2006 close season to become Billy Davies' assistant at Derby County in the Premier League, and he was replaced by former Canadian international Shaun Lowther for the 2007 campaign. Initially the managerial change seemed to affect Abbotsford's excellent form, the team picking up just one win and four ties in their first ten game. However, following their come-from-behind 3-2 win against Yakima Reds at the end of June, something clicked into place for Abbotsford: from that point on they began to utterly demolish their opponents, thrashing Cascade Surge 4-0, topping Yakima Reds 3-0, beating Tacoma Tide 4-1, and finishing the year with an absolutely astonishing 11-0 win over Spokane Spiders which included a double hat-trick SIX goals from striker James Severn. However, this late rally was not enough for them to make the playoffs, and they eventually finished a close third in the table behind BYU Cougars and Tacoma Tide.\n\nAbbotsford began the 2008 season as the first-ever opponents of the new Vancouver Whitecaps Residency franchise; they lost the opening matchup 3-1, but won their next fixture against BYU Cougars, setting in motion the story of most of the rest of the season. 2008 was the year of 'boom or bust' for Abbotsford, where almost every game was either a resounding victory or a humiliating defeat: they beat Cascade Surge 5-0 in a game which featured a hat trick from Adrian Kekec, beat Spokane Spiders 4-0 at home, and put another four past Cascade at the beginning of July. At the other end of the scale, they were hammered 4-1 by Vancouver Whitecaps Residency in the second of their three matchups, were on the receiving end of a 5-1 thrashing from eventual divisional champs Tacoma Tide, and lost 4-1 to Yakima Reds in the middle of the five-game winless streak that concluded their season. While Abbotsford's games were never anything less than entertaining, their erratic form proved costly, as they finished the season in 6th place. Spencer Schmidt was top scorer for the season, with 7 goals, while Justin Cordick scored five goals and contributed 4 assists.\n\n2009 was a return to the disappointing form of previous years for the Mariners, despite starting the season optimism following the hiring of local soccer personality Alan Errington as head coach. After a loss and a draw, they opened 2 game series at home against the new Victoria Highlanders franchise, and drew their home opener 2-2. Following their 2-1 return win over Victoria and 4-0 thrashing of the Spokane Spiders (in which Cameron Wilson scored twice) in late May, were in contention at the early stage of the season. However, June was a disaster for Abbotsford, as the team suffered several tough losses, being outplayed 3-1 by the Kitsap Pumas, and being slaughtered 6-1 on the road at the Takima Reds. The Mariners ultimately won just four games all season, their final two victories coming via an unexpectedly comprehensive 6-0 revenge victory over Yakima that featured a pair of braces from Gibson Bardsley and substitute Brendan Podolsky, and an astonishing topsy-turvy 5-3 win over Tacoma Tide which saw the team weather a strong fight back after being 4-1 ahead at one stage. The 5-0 final day loss to Portland Timbers U23's summed up the season, and left them in 8th place in the Northwest, 15 points behind divisional champs Kitsap. Cameron Wilson was the Mariners' top scorer, with 8 goals, while Spencer Schmidt contributed 4 assists.\n\n\"This list of notable former players comprises players who went on to play professional soccer after playing for the team in the Premier Development League, or those who previously played professionally before joining the team.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAttendance stats are calculated by averaging each team's self-reported home attendances from the historical match archive at https://web.archive.org/web/20100105175057/http://www.uslsoccer.com/history/index_E.html.\n\n\n"}

Their lyrics are in English and for the most part explore the human psyche and the way that everyday events can affect a person psychologically, hence the band's slogan: \"Seabound: Journey Into Your Mind.\"\n\nSeabound began in 1995 when Frank Spinath and Martin Vorbrodt were introduced by a mutual friend. They were so different musically that they weren't certain as to whether or not a musical collaboration between them would work. Despite the uncertainty they decided to try an informal jam-oriented home project. They soon realized that with a more focused approach, they might be able to produce something quite special. They made the band official and decided to call themselves Seabound. They decided on the name because of Spinath's love of the ocean and the fact that Vorbrodt was born near the shore. The name also implies a ship leaving from a safe harbor into the unknown and sometimes treacherous seas, a metaphor for the band itself. For live concerts they are supported by Daniel Wehmeier on drums.\n\nThe band recorded demos, which erroneously have come to now be known by fans as \"White Nights\", a hastily proposed and shortly afterwards discarded working title for their \"Beyond Flatline\" album, and eventually caught the attention of dependent.\n\nTheir debut album \"No Sleep Demon\" was released by Dependent in 2001. Drawing influence from the beat-oriented sounds of Front 242 and Covenant, as well as new wave acts such as Visage and Depeche Mode, the album proved to be relatively successful in the European EBM and Darkwave scenes. Tracks such as \"Travelling\" and \"Hooked\" were well-suited for club play; that exposure made the band known for their warm vocals, icy synth parts, and entrancing, sinuous melodies.\n\nThey took their time recording the follow-up album \"Beyond Flatline\". It was released in 2004 incorporating more of a trance influence into their sound. The duo embarked on a successful European tour with fellow Futurepop group Pride & Fall; this tour dawned the released a split EP entitled \"Beyond Flatline Tour 2004\". The release featured a remix of the duo's single at that time \"Watching Over You\". Later that year the duo's debut album \"No Sleep Demon\" was re-released as \"No Sleep Demon V2.0\" presenting new mixes of the songs \"Hooked\" and \"Avalost\".\n\nIn 2006 their third album, \"Double-Crosser\", was released, reaching No. 1 on the German Alternative Charts (DAC) and German Electronic Web Charts (GEWC). The album also reached No. 3 Hellenic Alternative Charts (HAC) and No. 6 Nordic Alternative Charts (NAC).\n\nIn 2009, Seabound released \"When Black Beats Blue\", an album containing rare and unreleased tracks. Seabound are the only band Die Form has remixed, and this album contains a version of \"Domination\" remixed by them.\n\nAfter 2009, Seabound took a break since Vorbrodt married and moved to California. The band released their latest album Speak in Storms in February 2014 and scored an entry in the German Media Control Charts (MCC), the German equivalent to the Billboard charts. The album was released in three different editions, from which two edition are 2-disc versions and were limited. The Tempest Edition of Speak In Storms was released in Book form and sold out within 2 months after release.\n\nSeabound has played various tours, mainly in Europe and North America. A complete archive of their live shows is available on their website.\n\n\n\nFull artist discography:\n\n\n"}

Yale and Theresa Yale. Her father was a Navy chaplain which meant that for many years she and her family moved to various locations in the United States and elsewhere before resettling in Evanston during her teen years. She earned a B.A. in English from Knox College.\n\nYale's first published comics work appeared in 1987 in the \"New America\" limited series, a spin-off of Timothy Truman's \"Scout\" series published by Eclipse Comics. She married fellow comics creator, and frequent collaborator, John Ostrander the same year. Yale and Ostrander developed the character of Barbara Gordon into Oracle, and wrote her origin in the short story \"Oracle: Year One\" published in \"The Batman Chronicles\" #5 (Summer 1996).\n\nThe two co-wrote \"Manhunter\", a series which DC launched in the wake of the \"Millennium\" crossover. Their collaboration on \"Suicide Squad\" included the \"Janus Directive\" storyline in issues #27–30 and the creation of the character Dybbuk in issue #45 (Sept. 1990). Yale served as an editor for DC from 1991–1993 and oversaw licensed titles such as \"Advanced Dungeons and Dragons\", \"Dragonlance\", \"Forgotten Realms\", \"Star Trek\", and \"\".\n\nYale was heavily involved with the Friends of Lulu, an organization promoting women in comics that operated from 1994-2011.

Following her diagnosis, the cancer spread to her abdomen and pelvis, a process she described in detail to the readers of the column. The cancer made it very difficult for her to write, and the origin story for Oracle included in \"The Batman Chronicles\" #5 (1996) was her last project.

He was later executed as part of the Great Purge during the Stalin period.\n\nKhodzhayev was born into an Uzbek family of wealthy traders in the City of Bukhara, Emirate of Bukhara in 1896. He was sent to Moscow by his father in 1907. There he realized the tremendous gap between contemporary European society and technology, and the ancient, tradition-bound ways of his homeland.\n\nHe joined the Pan-Turkist \"Jadid\" movement of like-minded reformers in 1916, and, with his father's fortune, established the Young Bukharan Party. Seeing the Russian Revolution of 1917 as an opportunity, the Young Bukharan Party invited the Bolsheviks of the Tashkent Soviet to seize Emirate of Bukhara by force in 1917. When this attempted invasion failed, Khodzhayev fled to Tashkent, and was only able to return after the Emir of Bukhara fled in September 1920 after the Red Army had overthrown his administration on 2 September 1920, bombed the city of Bukhara and occupied it.\n\nAfter joining the Russian Communist Party about July–August 1920, Fayzullo Khodzhayev was appointed head of the Bukharan People's Soviet Republic in September 1920. During his term, he barely escaped assassination by Basmachi Revolt leader Enver Pasha. With the reorganization of Soviet Central Asia into the new Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic and after the purge of suspected Uzbek nationalists in 1923–1924, on 5 December 1924, Khodzhayev became Chair of the Revolutionary Committee of the Uzbek SSR – at which time he was recognized as the head of government – and then on 17 February 1925, he became Chair of the Council of People's Commissars of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. Then on 21 May 1925, he became one of the chairmen of the USSR Central Executive Committee once the Uzbek SSR was officially accepted into the USSR.\n\nHowever, Khodzhayev opposed Joseph Stalin's heavy-handed control, particularly in the matter of cotton monoculture.\n\nWhen the wave of political purges reached into the Uzbek SSR, the 7th Congress of the Uzbek Communist Party of Bolsheviks proclaimed Khodzhayev to be an enemy of the people. On 17 June 1937, he was dismissed from all offices – including Chair of the Council of People's Commissars – and was arrested by 9 July 1937, during the Great Purge on charges to which he confessed at the Trial of the Twenty-One in March 1938 in Moscow as a \"Trotskyite and a Rightist\" and he was executed on 13 March 1938.\n\nOfficially rehabilitated in 1966, he remains a controversial figure in modern Uzbekistan.\n\nThere are few monuments to him in modern Uzbekistan, and although his father's house in Bukhara is preserved as a monument, it is styled as \"House of a Wealthy Local Merchant\", with very little emphasis on Khodzhayev himself.\n\n"}

{"id": "2225740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2225740", "title": "Thomas Sternhold", "text": "Thomas Sternhold\n\nThomas Sternhold (1500–1549) was an English courtier and the principal author of the first English metrical version of the Psalms, originally attached to the Prayer-Book as augmented by John Hopkins.\n\nAnthony Wood says that Sternhold entered Christ Church, Oxford, but did not take a degree. The first definite date in his life is 1538, when the name of Thomas Sternhold appears in Thomas Cromwell's accounts. He became one of the grooms of the robes to Henry VIII, and was a favourite, to whom a legacy of a hundred marks was bequeathed him by the king's will. He may have been the Thomas Sternell or Sternoll who was elected for Plymouth to the parliament that met on 30 January 1545, and was dissolved by Henry VIII's death in January 1547.\n\nSternhold was born in Blakeney, Gloucestershire and died on 23 August 1549. His will, dated August 1549, was proved on 12 September following. Among the witnesses to his will was Edward Whitchurch, probably his publisher. His property consisted of land in Hampshire and at Bodmin in Cornwall. Part of the Hampshire property might have been inherited. Slackstead, however, had been purchased recently, as it had been granted, as part of the possessions of Hyde Abbey, to Sir Ralph Sadler in 1547. The Bodmin property also he had purchased from the crown in 1543, as part of the possessions of the dissolved priory of St. Petrock there.\n\nHis earliest metrical versions of the Psalms may have been composed in Henry's reign; Miles Coverdale had published his 'Goostly Psalmes,' a translation of Luther's psalm versions, as early as 1535. In 1540 the earliest Psalms by Marot, \"valet de chambre\" to Francis I, were known at the French court, and soon afterwards passed into Protestant worship at Geneva. Sternhold, Marot, and Coverdale all wished to substitute the Psalms of David for the ballads of the court and people.\n\nSternhold (with the exception of Psalm cxx) used only one metre, and this the simplest of all ballad measures, the metre of \"Chevy Chace\". This choice of metre became the predominant metre (common metre) not only of the old and new versions of England and Scotland, but of other metrical psalters and English hymns in general. Sternhold is said to have sung his psalms to his organ for his own solace. (Strype). The only edition which Sternhold lived to publish he dedicated to the young king Edward VI. In this dedication he expresses a hope of ‘travayling further,’ and ‘performing the residue’ of the Psalter; but his total contribution to the old version consists of only forty psalms.\nSternhold is remembered as the originator of the first metrical version of the Psalms which obtained general currency alike in England and Scotland. The \"Versification of Certain Chapters of the Proverbs of Solomon\" has been attributed to him in error. Sternhold and Hopkins's version has had a larger circulation than any work in the language, except the authorised version of the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer. Sternhold's work forms its base. His first edition undated, but, as being dedicated to Edward VI, not earlier than 1547, contains nineteen psalms (i–v, xx, xxv, xxviii, xxix, xxxii, xxxiv, xli, xlix, lxxiii, lxxviii, ciii, cxx, cxxiii, cxxviii). It was printed by Edward Whitchurch, and is entitled ‘Certayne Psalmes chosē out of the Psalter of Dauid and drawē into Englishē Metre by Thomas Sternhold, grome of ye Kynges Maiesties Roobes’ (Brit. Museum). The second edition, printed after his death—apparently by John Hopkins, who adds seven psalms of his own in order to fill in a blank space—added to those of the former edition eighteen new psalms (vi–xvii, xix, xxi, xliii, xliv, lxiii, lxviii). It is entitled ‘Al such Psalmes of Dauid as Thomas Sternhold, late grome of the Kinges maiesties robes, did in his lyfetime drawe into English Metre,’ and is printed by Edward Whitchurche in 1549 (Cambridge University Library). Three more psalms (xviii, xxii, xxiii) are added to these in a rare edition of the growing Psalter printed by John Daye in 1561, and the complete number (40) appears in the full editions of 1562, 1563, and all subsequent ones. The only one of his psalms which remains current is the simple rendering of Psalm xxiii (‘My Shepherd is the Living Lord’). The text of his psalms, as found in all editions after 1556, follows the Genevan revision of that year.\n\nThe Sternhold-Hopkins psalter continued in general use till Nahum Tate and Nicholas Brady's \"New Version of the Psalms of David\" of 1696 was substituted in 1717.\n\n\n\n"}

Manda is one of the primary antagonists along with the Empress. When the submarine warship \"Gotengo\" attacks, Manda attacks and wraps its body around the ship, trying to crush it. But the \"Gotengo\" discharges electricity on Manda and shocks it. Manda unwraps itself and tries to swim away, but the \"Gotengo\" pursues it, later firing its Absolute Zero Cannon to freeze Manda.\n\nManda reappears again on Monsterland (along with several other monsters including Godzilla, Rodan, and Anguirus) in \"Destroy All Monsters\". Aliens called Kilaaks come to Earth and take control of Manda and the other monsters, making them attack cities worldwide (Manda is used to attack London) until the humans manage to free the monsters from the alien mind control. After this, the monsters are sent to fight King Ghidorah, although Manda does not fight in the battle, merely watching from the sidelines with Varan and Baragon. After Ghidorah is killed, Manda and the other monsters return to Monsterland.\n\nThe Manda prop used in \"Destroy All Monsters\" had no horns or whiskers on its face and the long fuzz running down its back was gone.\n\nIn the Millennium series, Manda is the first monster to be killed in \"\", playing a minor role, once again as an adversary of the \"Gotengo\". The \"Gotengo\" attacks Manda which is wrapped around its hull. The super-submarine manages to shake it off and sails into an underwater volcano to see if it can lure Manda inside. The plan works, but Manda is merely injured and continues to pursue the \"Gotengo\". The submarine then whips around and fires its Zero Cannon which hits Manda, causing it to freeze instantly, after which \"Gotengo\" uses its drill to easily pierce the frozen Manda, causing the monster to shatter and die. In this movie, Manda, along with Zilla and Kamacuras while flying, is computer generated.\n\nIn the prequel novel: Godzilla: Monster Apocalypse, Manda inhabited the North Atlantic Sea and reclaimed the Dover Strait as its territory and it and sunk ships. Later the Gotengo engaged during \"Operation: Eternal Light\" and kill Manda. However, Manda or another Manda appeared in \"Project: Mechagodzilla, it appeared in the Gulf of Persia during \"Operation: Great Wall\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2225745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2225745", "title": "Join Java", "text": "Join Java\n\nJoin Java is a programming language based on the join-pattern that extends the standard Java programming language with the join semantics of the join-calculus. It was written at the University of South Australia within the Reconfigurable Computing Lab by Dr. Von Itzstein.\n\nThe Join Java extension introduces three new language constructs:\n\nConcurrency in most popular programming languages is implemented using constructs such as semaphores and monitors. Libraries are emerging (such as the Java concurrency library JSR-166) that provide higher-level concurrency semantics. Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) and Pi have higher-level synchronization behaviours defined implicitly through the composition of events at the interfaces of concurrent processes. Join calculus, in contrast, has explicit synchronization based on a localized conjunction of events defined as reduction rules. Join semantics try to provide explicit expressions of synchronization without breaching the object-oriented idea of modularization, including dynamic creation and destruction of processes and channels.\n\nThe Join Java language can express virtually all published concurrency patterns without explicit recourse to low-level monitor calls. In general, Join Java programs are more concise than their Java equivalents. The overhead introduced in Join Java by the higher-level expressions derived from the Join calculus is manageable. The synchronization expressions associated with monitors (wait and notify) which are normally located in the body of methods can be replaced by Join Java expressions (the Join methods) which form part of the method signature.\n\nA Join method is defined by two or more Join fragments. A Join method will\nexecute once all the fragments of the Join pattern have been called.\nIf the return type is a standard Java type then the leading fragment will\nblock the caller until the Join pattern is complete and the method has\nexecuted. If the return type is of type signal then the\nleading fragment will return immediately. All trailing fragments are\nasynchronous so will not block the caller.\n\nExample:\n\nJoin fragments can be repeated in multiple Join patterns so there can be\na case when multiple Join patterns are completed when a fragment is called.\nSuch a case could occur in the example below if B(), C() and D() then A() are\ncalled. The final A() fragment completes three of the patterns so there are\nthree possible methods that may be called. The ordered class\nmodifier is used here to determine which Join method will be called.\nThe default and when using the unordered class modifier is\nto pick one of the methods at random. With the ordered\nmodifier the methods are prioritised according to the order they are declared.\n\nExample:\n\nAsynchronous methods are defined by using the signal\nreturn type. This has the same characteristics as the void\ntype except that the method will return immediately. When an asynchronous\nmethod is called a new thread is created to execute the body of the method.\n\nExample:\n\nPolyphonic C sharp is the closest related language.<br>\nCω the successor of Polyphonic C sharp.\n\nHardware Join Java language further extended Join Java to implement Hardware semantics. This language extended the semantics of Join Java to FPGA applications.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2225753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2225753", "title": "Gad Guard", "text": "Gad Guard\n\nSeveral hundred years in the future, the natural resources of the Earth are exhausted, and the progression of the human race has stagnated. Hajiki Sanada, a delivery boy, lives with mother and sister in Unit Blue, in the impoverished part of the Unit known as 'Night Town'. While delivering a package, he unwittingly stumbles upon a 'Gad', a mysterious device that reacts to the strong feelings of a nearby person. The Gad transforms, taking on the form of a humanoid robot referred to as a 'Techode'. Hajiki soon discovers he isn't the only one who has had contact with a Gad, and that contact with one doesn't always end well. The series follows his struggles to cope with his new friends, his techode, and his life in Night Town.\n\nThe central Unit in which Gad Guard takes place is Unit Blue, which is separated into three levels: Gold Town, Day Town and Night Town.\n\nGold Town is the upper-class area, where the wealthy and well-off live in comfort and luxury, and plays host to Global Electronics, the foremost provider of electricity in Unit Blue, a commodity not everyone can afford to have all the time. The characters Takumi Kisaragi and Aiko Mary Harmony live in Gold Town.\n\nDay Town is a middle-class area, equipped with running water and electricity and is busy and metropolitan in most places. The character Arashi Shinozuka is originally from this area where her father owns a karate dojo. While not as perfect as Gold Town, Day Town is seen by people on the other side of the tracks as the place where they'd rather be.\n\nNight Town is the ghetto of Unit Blue, and is called \"Night Town\" because of the fact that all the electrical power shuts off at midnight and does not come back until dawn. In Night Town gangs and punks run the streets, and all the local kids go to school at a church, taught by a nun and a young teacher, in hopes of giving them what they need to escape their meager living. Leaving something outside at night is guaranteed to have it stolen, and even walking around in broad daylight can be dangerous. Night Town is the dank and grimy setting for most of Gad Guard, where Hajiki and his family live along with Katana, the Jacque Bruno Gang and a host of other characters.\n\nKnown in the Gad Guard world only as \"powerful stones\", everyone who knows of them desires Gads and believes that they can fulfill people's dreams. Though the real importance of a Gad is unknown, they are used as very high sums of currency and are usually only owned by the rich or powerful. A Gad has many peculiar abilities and can take shape into a number of things depending on the personality and thoughts of the owner. These creations are separated into three groups: Techodes, A-Techodes and Gadrians. It is unknown what initially triggers a Gad's transformation, while strong feelings are involved, other times there is no reaction at all. Upon a Gad's transformation into something, all metal and most other material around it are violently absorbed and used as a base for the final product.\n\nA Techode is one of the three things that sprout from a Gad, and is also called a \"Gadrian\" occasionally by characters who aren't aware of the difference between the two. It usually takes the form of a large, humanoid robot roughly tall fueled by the emotional bond between the robot and the owner. These robots are \"born\" after contact with the Gad's owner while they're having a strong or serious emotion in an area occupied by a lot of metal. Once it has transformed into a Techode, a Gad is considered 'lost' and 'useless'. Only a Techode's 'owner' is capable of controlling it, so it is nearly impossible to sell or trade Techodes. It is implied that those with pure or good intent end up with Techodes, while those with darker, more twisted feelings getting a hold of a Gad leads to the creation of A-Techodes or Gadrians.\n\nThe five main Techodes of the series; Lightning, Zero, Thunderbolt, Messerschmitt and Hayate are all named after World War II-era fighter planes.\n\nAn A-Techode is a manifestation of one's darker feelings. Most Gads take the form of A-Techodes, Techodes being very rare. They generally take the shapes of chaotic-looking monsters and are formed in the same way Techodes are, by absorbing the materials around them. Unlike Techodes, A-Techodes are independent creations. An A-Techode's creation can also be the result of a Gad falling into the hands of someone without any kind of strong, impacting emotions or intentions, such as a young child; the result is a sentient manifestation of whatever the child was thinking about at the time.\n\nA Gadrian is what is formed when feelings of hate or greed completely consume the owner of a Gad, and likewise, the Gad itself. The Gad then absorbs these thoughts of greed and anger, usually killing the owner of the Gad and creating a monster, organic in nature with technological modification. Unlike Techodes, Gadrians are made of both inorganic and organic matter. Gadrians can be considered a sub-class of A-Techodes.\n\nOpening theme:\nEnding theme:\n\n"}
