The band was founded in 1989 and named in honour of two eccentric Cork characters.\n\nThe original band line-up included Paul Linehan (as vocalist/bassist), his brother Niall Linehan (as guitarist), and Ashley Keating (on drums).\n\nNiall Linehan was replaced as guitarist in 2004 by Kevin Pedreschi, who was in-turn replaced by Rory Murphy in 2010. Cian Corbett joined on keyboard duties in 2005.\n\nSigning for the Setanta label in 1991, the group debuted with the release \"EP1\", and the lead track \"Fashion Crisis Hits New York\" became an indie hit. The follow-up EP \"EP.2\" was released soon after, which was followed by the band's signing to the Go! Discs label where The Franks partnered with producer Edwyn Collins to record the \"Happy Busman\" EP. They found success in the UK, and following a tour in support of Carter USM, an Ian Broudie remix of the LP song \"After All\" reached the Top 20 in the UK Singles Chart, where it peaked at No. 11, and it also peaked at No. 5 in the Irish chart. The group appeared on BBC Television's \"Top of the Pops\" in support of the single.\n\nAfter a long sabbatical which the band attributed to a \"fear of music\", the group returned with \"Grand Parade\" (with contributions from Gus Dudgeon) on 23 June 1997, and the \"Indian Ocean\" EP later in the year. This was followed with \"Beauty Becomes More Than Life\" in 1998 and \"Glass\" in 2000. Setanta released a well received \"Best Of\" in 2002. In 2004, Niall Linehan left and was replaced by a friend of the band, Kevin Pedreschi. The band signed a new deal with FIFA Records, and released a retrospective triple album, \"Souvenirs\", in October 2005. A further album, \"A Renewed Interest in Happiness\", was released on 27 October 2006. The band released a comeback single in 2010 entitled \"The Parson\", as part of their \"Seasonal Single Releases\" project, which saw the band release a single per season. \"The Parson\" launched as the spring season single, with \"Let It Out\" following in the summer, \"The Clock\" in the autumn, and a Christmas-themed \"Song for a Future Love\" in December.\n\nTogether with The Sultans of Ping FC and Power of Dreams, \"The Franks\" (as they are sometimes known by fans) played a number of co-headlining shows as part of the \"Reverberation Tour\" in December 2010. They also toured several festivals in 2011, including Vantastival and Indiependence.\n\nThe band returned to the studio in August 2011 to work on a new album – released in March 2012. The first single from this album, entitled \"\"Indie Lovesong\"\", was released on Valentine's Day 14 February 2012 and was supported by a UK tour. Their sixth studio album was named \"Greenwich Mean Time\" and released on 9 March 2012. The album was well received and supported by tours in Europe, USA and Japan.\n\nIn September 2012 The Frank and Walters undertook on a 20th anniversary celebration tour marking their debut album \"Trains, Boats and Planes\", and in May 2015 released a single titled \"Look at Us Now\".\n\nThe band embarked on a celebratory tour during October 2017, to mark 20 years since the release of their second album \"Grand Parade\".\n\nIn March 2018, approximately 25 years after its original release, a cover of the Frank and Walter's single \"After All\" featured in the TV series \"The Young Offenders\", and subsequently charted at No. 2 in the iTunes downloads chart for Ireland.\n\nStudio albums\n\nCompilation albums\n\nSingles\n\n"}
{"id": "2321283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321283", "title": "Chris DeGarmo", "text": "Chris DeGarmo\n\nChristopher Lee DeGarmo (born June 14, 1963) is an American heavy metal and hard rock guitarist and songwriter, best known for being a lead and rhythm guitarist, backing vocalist, and primary songwriter in the progressive metal band Queensrÿche from their formation in 1980 until 1998, and with whom he played during their most commercially successful period. He briefly returned for collaborations in 2003 and 2007. DeGarmo was a member of Jerry Cantrell's band during his 1998 solo tour, and also contributed to his 2002 album, \"Degradation Trip\". In 1999, he co-founded the short-lived supergroup Spys4Darwin with Alice in Chains drummer Sean Kinney. Since departing from Queensrÿche, DeGarmo has made his living as a professional private jet pilot. Since 2009, he has been making music with his daughter Rylie DeGarmo under the name The Rue, and collaborated with Alice in Chains on their 2018 album, \"Rainier Fog\". DeGarmo was nominated for three Grammy Awards as a songwriter.\n\nDeGarmo was born in Wenatchee, Washington. The family he grew up in was struggling as his father had abandoned them. He would later write about this in \"Bridge\", from Queensryche's 1994 \"Promised Land\" album. The song describes DeGarmo's cherished relationship with his grandfather, and the emotional experience of his biological father trying to make amends after years of absence.\n\nIn sixth grade, he was in the same class as his future bandmate Scott Rockenfield. DeGarmo joined Interlake High School as a sophomore in 1979, and joined his school-mates in garage bands such as Joker, which included guitarist Michael Wilton. After he was kicked out of Joker to be replaced with a guitarist who could afford more expensive equipment, DeGarmo formed the band Tempest with singer and bass player Mark Hovland and drummer Kevin Hodges on drums, who left and was replaced by Mark Welling, after which the band was renamed to D-H-W (DeGarmo-Hovland-Welling).\n\nIn 1980, Wilton and Rockenfield, who was a drummer, had founded a band called Cross+Fire, and DeGarmo and Hovland joined shortly thereafter. They played covers of popular heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. Hovland left because he had to commute quite far and wasn't really into Iron Maiden. In his place came bassist Eddie Jackson, a high school friend of Rockenfield. The band name was changed to The Mob. In 1982, they switched from playing cover songs to writing original material, and recruited Geoff Tate as their vocalist. After recording what was to become the group's debut EP at Triad studios in Redmond, WA, the band settled on the name Queensrÿche (derived from the DeGarmo composition, and opening EP track \"Queen of the Reich\").\nAs their primary songwriter, DeGarmo was largely responsible for writing the band's intricate compositions together with Wilton and Tate. In 1990, \"I Don't Believe in Love\" by DeGarmo and Tate, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. DeGarmo was the sole writer for the band's 1991 hit \"Silent Lucidity\", which reached the top ten on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, was Grammy nominated in two categories (Best Rock Song, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal) at the 1992 awards, as well as five VMA nominations and one win, and which earned the guitarist a BMI songwriter's award.\n\nDeGarmo left Queensrÿche for undisclosed reasons in late 1997 following the band's tour in support of the band's sixth studio album, \"Hear in the Now Frontier\". His departure was not made public until January 28, 1998. Reflecting on Queensryche's Promised Land era, DeGarmo revealed that he had already considered leaving the band:\n\nI was questioning the long term stability of the group by that point. The level of internal and external dysfunction was unacceptable to me. Apparently, no one else was paying attention, or bothered to compare the successful elements and priorities of our past to our current trajectory.\n\nHis remarks appear to be in line with later statements from other band members that burnout and a desire to pursue interests outside of Queensrÿche were the reasons for his departure. For example, Rockenfield has said: \"He wanted to pursue other things. He felt like he had done what he wanted musically in his life, and wanted to move on.\" However, Dan Birchall of the fan magazine \"Screaming in Digital\" paints a more complex picture of three factors culminating in DeGarmo's decision to quit the band:\n\nDeGarmo was succeeded in Queensrÿche by Kelly Gray (1998–2002), Mike Stone (2002–2008), and Parker Lundgren (2008–present).\n\nWith an impending deadline to deliver their next album, and the band's strained internal relationships leaving them short on material, a call was placed to DeGarmo to see if he would be interested in contributing songs to the project. After a meeting with Tate, he agreed and took part in the sessions for \"Tribe\", contributing the music to the songs \"Falling Behind\", \"Doin' Fine\" and \"Art of Life\", and co-writing the music to \"Desert Dance\" and \"Open\".\nDeGarmo had also written both the music and lyrics to the song \"Justified\", but it was not included on the album since he prematurely left the recording sessions. The song would later be included on the collector's edition of their 2007 greatest hits album, \"\". It is generally assumed that similar interpersonal problems as in 1997 are the cause for his second departure.\n\nAfter his departure from the band, DeGarmo rarely makes public appearances, but he has always remained friends with Queensrÿche, and especially his high-school friend Wilton. Because he remains highly regarded in the eyes of Queensrÿche's fan base, both he and the other band members are frequently asked if he is ever to rejoin Queensrÿche. Wilton answered that question in June 2013 as follows: \"if there is a chance of collaboration, well, we'll just keep that a secret.\" In 2011, DeGarmo commented:\n\nWell, I'll never say never. I don't know how likely it is though. I'm still on good terms with everyone. We're still connected and communicating. We have the chemistry, that's not an issue.\n\nThe most profound line-up change for Queensrÿche since DeGarmo's departure in 1997, was when remaining founding members Rockenfield, Wilton and Jackson fired Tate in June 2012, leading to a court case that has temporarily allowed both parties to use the band's name and has caused a division among the fans. Although DeGarmo has refrained from publicly commenting on any of this, both sides have talked with restraint about DeGarmo's opinion regarding the current band situation, and they suggest that he has remained friends with both parties. Tate said about his relationship with DeGarmo: \"We're friends. We see each other probably once a month—play golf, have lunch.\" Wilton commented:\n\nChris and I have always been good friends. I mean, we grew up together, we were high school buddies and we're still friends. I golf with him all the time. Our families are friends. And, yes, he's aware of what's going on. I'm not going to speak for him, but I can say that he supports everything that we're doing and it's great that Chris and I have a connection. You know, he's got a lot of things in the fire that he wants to do and he's a true connoisseur of great songwriting. That's basically all I can really tell you. Definitely, he's around, we talk a lot, but I really can't say anything.\n\nIn 2013, DeGarmo and Rockenfield celebrated their 50th birthdays together, as their birthdays are only one day apart. Other members of Queensrÿche were also present.\n\nAfter leaving Queensrÿche, DeGarmo began a full-time career as a professional business jet pilot. He holds an Airline Transport Pilot Licence, which he acquired during Queensrÿche's most commercially successful years. as well as CL-30 (Challenger 300), LR-JET (Learjet), IA-Jet (Westwind) and LR-45 (Learjet 45) type ratings from the FAA. In 2013, Rockenfield said that \"he [DeGarmo] is very successful at it\".\n\nDeGarmo's post-Queensrÿche musical career includes collaborations with guitarist Jerry Cantrell (as a touring guitarist in 1998, and an appearance on the 2002 \"Degradation Trip\" studio album playing slide guitar on the track \"Anger Rising\"), and with singer Vinnie Dombroski from Sponge, Alice in Chains bassist Mike Inez and drummer Sean Kinney in the short-lived project Spys4Darwin, which DeGarmo co-founded with Kinney in 1999 after they toured as part of Jerry Cantrell's band on his \"Boggy Depot\" tour. The group released one EP in 2001, \"Microfish\", and made their live debut at the Endfest in Seattle on August 4, 2001.\n\nOn February 18, 2005, DeGarmo joined the remaining members of the popular rock band Alice in Chains and other Seattle area artists for the \"Tsunami Continued Care Relief Concert\". He assisted the rock band Dredg with the production and arrangement of their 2005 studio album \"Catch Without Arms\", and he has written a few film score songs with Dredg's frontman Gavin Hayes.\n\nDeGarmo lives in the Seattle area with his wife and children. He has been working on a project called The Rue with his daughter Rylie DeGarmo since 2009. In 2013, Rockenfield said: \"His daughter is a singer and he helps her a little bit on the songs. Otherwise, he mostly does music on the side. Chris recently told me, that he is absolutely happy with his life the way it is.\" In 2015, The Rue released their self-titled six-song debut EP.\n\nIn 2018, DeGarmo played acoustic guitar on the track \"Drone\" from Alice in Chains' sixth album, \"Rainier Fog\". While the band was recording at Studio X in the summer of 2017, Jerry Cantrell was struggling with the acoustic part that he described as a \"spider-chord, weird plucking thing\". DeGarmo was at the studio around that time, so Cantrell decided to let him play the acoustic guitar instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

WildAid works with media, governments, celebrities and local partners and communities worldwide to make wildlife conservation a global priority. WildAid has partnered with organizations such as the African Wildlife Foundation, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, and SharkSavers. Charity Navigator has given WildAid a perfect score of 100.00 since December 1, 2016.\n\nWildAid was originally founded in 1995 by Steven R. Galster and Michael C. Mitchell under the name Global Survival Network (GSN). GSN was an environmental NGO which focused on countering wildlife and human trafficking. At GSN, Peter Knights ran a successful program to reduce demand for wildlife. \n\nGalster conducted undercover video with poachers to strengthen attempts to prevent poaching. Galster's undercover meetings revealed a strong connection between animal poachers and human traffickers, which led the GSN to make efforts to combat human trafficking. From 1995-1997 GSN personally undertook a two-year undercover investigation into the international relationship between animal and human trafficking, which included personal meetings with human traffickers and trafficked women.\n\nVideo footage and information from the investigation was used to create a GSN written report, “Crime & Servitude” and a 1997 video documentary, “Bought & Sold.” Upon its release, \"Bought & Sold\" received widespread media coverage in the US and internationally, and was featured in specials on ABC Primetime Live, CNN, and BBC. The documentary contributed to the development of new legislative reforms and financial initiatives to combat human trafficking. The materials that were collected during the two year expose are housed at the Human Rights Documentation Initiative (HRDI), The University of Texas at Austin.\n\nIn 2000, Galster, Gauntlett, Knights and a colleague of theirs, Steve Trent, teamed up to strengthen GSN, focus it on the environment, and re-brand it as \"WildAid\". Eventually, WildAid's four co-directors split up and formed four different organizations with different areas of focus: Trent founded the Environmental Justice Foundation in 2001, Gauntlett formed Wildlife Alliance in 2004, Galster founded the Freeland Foundation in 2008 to continue the fight against human trafficking, and Knights maintained directorship of WildAid. Today, WildAid works in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, China, Indonesia, India, and Ecuador with headquarters in San Francisco, California. In 2014 WildAid merged with Shark Savers, a non-profit committed to the conservation of sharks.\n\nIn 2019, WildAid partnered with the government of Thailand and the United States Agency for International Development to launch \"A Good Life is Free of Killing\", a campaign to end wildlife trafficking.\n\nYao Ming, Jackie Chan, Leonardo DiCaprio, Harrison Ford, Jane Goodall, Kate Hudson, and Amitabh Bachchan are among their celebrity ambassadors.

{"id": "2321316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321316", "title": "Woodland period", "text": "Woodland period\n\nIn the classification of , the Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures spanned a period from roughly 1000 BCE to European contact in the eastern part of North America, with some archaeologists distinguishing the Mississippian period, from 1000 CE to European contact as a separate period. The term \"Woodland Period\" was introduced in the 1930s as a generic term for prehistoric sites falling between the Archaic hunter-gatherers and the agriculturalist Mississippian cultures. The Eastern Woodlands cultural region covers what is now eastern Canada south of the Subarctic region, the Eastern United States, along to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThis period is variously considered a developmental stage, a time period, a suite of technological adaptations or \"traits\", and a \"family tree\" of cultures related to earlier Archaic cultures. It can be characterized as a chronological and cultural manifestation without any massive changes in a short time but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools, leather crafting, textile manufacture, cultivation, and shelter construction. Many Woodland peoples used spears and atlatls until the end of the period, when they were replaced by bows and arrows; however, Southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns.\n\nThe most cited technological distinction of this period was the widespread use of pottery (although pottery manufacture had arisen during the Archaic period in some places), and the diversification of pottery forms, decorations, and manufacturing practices. The increasing use of horticulture and the development of the Eastern Agricultural Complex, consisting of weedy seed plants as well as gourd cultivation, also meant that groups became less mobile over time and, in some times and places, people lived in permanently occupied villages and cities. Intensive agriculture characterizes the Mississippian period from c. 1000–1400 CE and may have continued up to European contact, around 500 years ago.\n\nThe Early Woodland period continued many trends begun during the Late and Terminal Archaic periods, including extensive mound-building, regional distinctive burial complexes, the trade of exotic goods across a large area of North America as part of interaction spheres, the reliance on both wild and domesticated plant foods, and a mobile subsistence strategy in which small groups took advantage of seasonally available resources such as nuts, fish, shellfish, and wild plants. Pottery, which had been manufactured during the Archaic period in limited amounts, was now widespread across the Eastern Interior, the Southeast, and the Northeast. The Far Northeast, the Sub-Arctic, and the Northwest/Plains regions widely adopted pottery somewhat later, about 200 BCE.\n\nThe Adena culture built conical mounds in which single- or multiple-event burials, often cremated, were interred along with rich grave goods including copper bracelets, beads, and gorgets, art objects made from mica, novaculite, hematite, banded slate, and other kinds of stone, shell beads and cups, and leaf-shaped \"cache blades\". This culture is believed to have been core to the Meadowood Interaction Sphere, in which cultures in the Great Lakes region, the St. Lawrence region, the Far Northeast, and the Atlantic region interacted. The large area of interaction is indicated by the presence of Adena-style mounds, the presence of exotic goods from other parts of the interaction spheres, and the participation in the \"Early Woodland Burial Complex\" defined by William Ritchie \n\nPottery was widely manufactured and sometimes traded, particularly in the Eastern Interior region. Clay for pottery was typically tempered (mixed with non-clay additives) with grit (crushed rock) or limestone. Pots were usually made in a conoidal or conical jars with rounded shoulders, slightly constricted necks, and flaring rims. Pottery was most often decorated with a variety of linear or paddle stamps that created \"dentate\" (tooth-like) impressions, wavy line impressions, checked surfaces, or fabric-impressed surfaces, but some pots were incised with geometric patterns or, more rarely, with pictorial imagery such as faces. Pots were coiled and paddled entirely by hand without the use of fast rotation such as a pottery wheel. Some were slipped or brushed with red ochre.\n\nPottery, agriculture, and permanent settlements have often been thought of the three defining characteristics of the Woodland period. However, it has become evident that, in some areas of North America, prehistoric cultural groups with a clearly Archaic cultural assemblage were making pottery without any evidence of the cultivation of domesticated crops. In fact, it appears that hunting and gathering continued as the basic subsistence economy and that subsistence horticulture/agriculture did not occur in much of the Southeast for a couple of thousand years after the introduction of pottery, and in parts of the Northeast, horticulture was never practiced. This research indicated that a fiber-tempered horizon of ceramics greatly predates 1000 BCE, first appearing about 2500 BCE in parts of Florida with the Orange culture and in Georgia with the Stallings culture. Nevertheless, these early sites were typical Archaic settlements, differing only in the use of basic ceramic technology. As such, researchers are now redefining the period to begin with not only pottery, but the appearance of permanent settlements, elaborate burial practices, intensive collection and/or horticulture of starchy seed plants (see Eastern Agricultural Complex), differentiation in social organization, and specialized activities, among other factors. Most of these are evident in the Southeastern Woodlands by 1000 BCE.\n\nIn some areas, like South Carolina and coastal Georgia, Deptford culture pottery manufacture ceased after c. 700 CE.\n\nIn coastal regions, many settlements were near the coast, often near salt marshes, which were habitats rich in food resources. People tended to settle along rivers and lakes in both coastal and interior regions for maximum access to food resources. Nuts were processed in large amounts, including hickory and acorns, and many wild berries, including palm berries, blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries, were eaten, as well as wild grapes and persimmon. Most groups relied heavily on white-tailed deer, but a variety of other small and large mammals were hunted also, including beaver, raccoon, and bear. Shellfish formed an important part of the diet, attested to by numerous shell middens along the coast and interior rivers.\n\nCoastal peoples practiced seasonal mobility, moving to the coast during the summer to take advantage of numerous marine resources such as sea mammals and shellfish, then moved to interior locations during the winter where access to deer, bear, and anadromous fish such as salmon could see them through the winter. Seasonal foraging also characterized the strategies of many interior populations, with groups moving strategically among dense resource areas.\n\nRecently evidence has accumulated of a greater reliance of woodland peoples on cultivation in this period, at least in some localities, than has historically been recognized. This is especially true for the middle woodland period and perhaps beyond. C. Margaret Scarry states \"in the Woodland periods, people diversified their use of plant foods ... [they] increased their consumption of starchy foods. They did so, however, by cultivating starchy seeds rather than by gathering more acorns.\" Smith and Yarnell refer to an \"indigenous crop complex\" as early as 3800 B.P. in parts of the region.\n\nThe beginning of the Middle Woodland saw a shift of settlement to the Interior. As the Woodland period progressed, local and inter-regional trade of exotic materials greatly increased to the point where a trade network covered most of the Eastern Woodlands. Throughout the Southeast and north of the Ohio River, burial mounds of important people were very elaborate and contained a variety of mortuary gifts, many of which were not local. Among the traded materials were copper from the Lake Superior deposits; silver from Lake Superior and especially Ontario; galena from Missouri and Illinois; mica from the southern Appalachians; chert from various places including Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois; pipestone from Ohio and Illinois; alligator teeth from the lower Mississippi Valley eastward to Florida; marine shells, especially whelks, from the south Atlantic and Gulf coasts; Knife River chalcedony from North Dakota; and obsidian from Yellowstone in Wyoming. The most archaeologically certifiable sites of burial during this time were in Illinois and Ohio. These have come to be known as the Hopewell tradition. Due to the similarity of earthworks and burial goods, researchers assume a common body of religious practice and cultural interaction existed throughout the entire region (referred to as the \"Hopewellian Interaction Sphere\"). Such similarities could also be the result of reciprocal trade, obligations, or both between local clans that controlled specific territories. Access to food or resources outside a clan's territory would be made possible through formal agreements with neighbors. Clan heads would then be buried along with goods received from their trading partners to symbolize the relationships they had established. Under this scenario, permanent settlements would be likely to develop, leading to increased agricultural production and a population increase.\n\nCeramics during this time were thinner and better quality than earlier times. Examples also show pottery also was more decorated than Early Woodland. One style was the Trempealeau phase which could have been seen by the Hopewell in Indiana. This type included a round body, and lines of decoration with cross-etching on rim. The Havana style found in Illinois had a decorated neck. One of the major tools unique to this era was Snyders Points. These were quite large and corner-notched. They were made by soft-hammering percussion, and finished by pressure flaking.\n\nAlthough many of the Middle Woodland cultures are called \"Hopewellian\", and groups shared ceremonial practices, archeologists have identified the development of distinctly separate cultures during the Middle Woodland period. Examples include the Armstrong culture, Copena culture, Crab Orchard culture, Fourche Maline culture, the Goodall Focus, the Havana Hopewell culture, the Kansas City Hopewell, the Marksville culture, and the Swift Creek culture.\n\nThe Center for American Archeology specializes in Middle Woodland culture.\n\nThe late Woodland period was a time of apparent population dispersal, although populations do not appear to have decreased. In most areas construction of burial mounds decreased drastically, as well as long-distance trade in exotic materials. At the same time, bow and arrow technology gradually overtook the use of the spear and atlatl, and agricultural production of the \"Three Sisters\" (maize, beans, and squash) was introduced. While full scale intensive agriculture did not begin until the following Mississippian period, the beginning of serious cultivation greatly supplemented the gathering of plants.\n\nLate Woodland settlements became more numerous, but the size of each one (with exceptions) was smaller than their middle Woodland counterparts. The reasons for this are unknown, but it has been theorized that populations increased so much that trade alone could no longer support the communities and some clans resorted to raiding others for resources. Alternatively, the efficiency of bows and arrows in hunting may have decimated the large game animals, forcing the tribes to break apart into smaller clans to better use local resources, thus limiting the trade potential of each group. A third possibility is a colder climate may have affected food yields, possibly affected by Northern Hemisphere extreme weather events of 535–536, also limiting trade possibilities. Lastly, it may be that agricultural technology became sophisticated enough that crop variation between clans lessened, thereby decreasing the need for trade.\n\nAs communities became more isolated, they began to develop in their own unique ways, giving rise to small-scale cultures that were distinctive to their regional areas. Examples include the Baytown, Troyville and Coles Creek cultures of Louisiana, the Alachua and Weeden Island cultures of Florida, and the Plum Bayou culture of Arkansas and Missouri.\n\nAlthough the 1000 CE ending of the Late Woodland period is traditional, in practice many regions of the Eastern Woodlands adopted the full Mississippian culture much later than that. Some groups in the north and northeast of the current United States, such as the Iroquois, retained a way of life that was technologically identical to the Late Woodland until the arrival of Europeans. Furthermore, despite the widespread adoption of the bow and arrow during this time, the peoples of a few areas appear never to have made the change. During Hernando de Soto's travels through the Southeastern Woodlands around 1543, the groups at the mouth of the Mississippi river still preferentially used the spear.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2321327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321327", "title": "James Hadley Chase", "text": "James Hadley Chase\n\nJames Hadley Chase (24 December 1906 – 6 February 1985) was an English writer. While his birth name was René Lodge Brabazon Raymond, he was well known by his various pseudonyms, including James Hadley Chase, James L. Docherty, Raymond Marshall, R. Raymond, and Ambrose Grant. He was one of the best known thriller writers of all time. The canon of Chase, comprising 90 titles, earned him a reputation as the king of thriller writers in Europe. He was also one of the internationally best-selling authors, and to date 50 of his books have been made into films.\n\nRené Lodge Brabazon Raymond (James Hadley Chase) was born on 24 December 1906 in London, England. He was the son of Colonel Francis Raymond of the colonial Indian Army, a veterinary surgeon. His father intended his son to have a scientific career and had him educated at King's School, Rochester, Kent.\n\nChase left home at the age of 18. In 1932, Chase married Sylvia Ray, and they had a son. In 1956, they moved to France. In 1969, they moved to Switzerland, living a secluded life in Corseaux-sur-Vevey, on Lake Geneva. Chase eventually died there on 6 February 1985.\n\nDuring World War II he served in the Royal Air Force, achieving the rank of Squadron Leader. He edited the RAF journal with David Langdon and had several stories from it published after the war in the book \"Slipstream: A Royal Air Force Anthology\".\n\nAfter Chase left home at the age of 18, he worked in sales, primarily focusing on books and literature. He sold children's encyclopaedias, while also working in a bookshop. He also served as an executive for a book wholesaler, before turning to a writing career that produced more than 90 mystery books. His interests included photography (he was up to professional standard), reading and listening to classical music, being a particularly enthusiastic opera lover. Also, as a form of relaxation between novels, he put together highly complicated and sophisticated Meccano models.\n\nProhibition and the ensuing Great Depression in the US (1929–39) had given rise to the Chicago gangster culture prior to World War II. This, combined with Chase's book trade experience, made him realise that there was a big demand for gangster stories. After reading James M. Cain's novel \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" (1934), and having read about the American gangster Ma Barker and her sons, and with the help of maps and a slang dictionary, he wrote \"No Orchids for Miss Blandish\" in his spare time, allegedly over a period of six week-ends (though his papers suggest it took longer.) The book achieved remarkable notoriety and became one of the best-selling books of the decade. It was the subject of the 1944 essay \"Raffles and Miss Blandish\" by George Orwell. Chase and Robert Nesbitt adapted it to a stage play of the same name which ran in London's West End to good reviews. The 1948 film adaptation was widely denounced as salacious due to the film's portrayal of violence and sexuality. Robert Aldrich did a remake, \"The Grissom Gang\", in 1971.\n\nDuring the war, Raymond edited the RAF's official magazine and from that period comes Chase's short story \"The Mirror in Room 22\", in which he tried his hand outside the crime genre. It was set in an old house, occupied by officers of a squadron. The owner of the house had committed suicide in his bedroom, and the last two occupants of the room had been found with a razor in their hands and their throats cut. The Wing Commander tells that when he started to shave before the mirror, he found another face in it. The apparition drew the razor across his throat. The Wing Commander says, \"I use a safety razor, otherwise, I might have met with a serious accident – especially if I had been using an old-fashioned cut-throat.\" The story was published under the author's real name, Rene Raymond, in the anthology of RAF writings \"Slipstream\" in 1946.\n\nDuring World War II, Chase became friendly with Merrill Panitt (subsequently editor of \"TV Guide\"), who provided him with a dictionary of American slang, detailed maps and reference books of the American underworld. This gave Chase the background for his early books with American settings, a number of which were based on actual events occurring there. Chase never lived in the United States though he did make two brief visits, one to Miami and the other en route to Mexico.\n\nChase was subject to several court cases during his career. In 1942, his novel \"Miss Callaghan Comes to Grief\" (1941), a lurid account of the white slave trade, was banned by the British authorities after the author and publishers Jarrold were found guilty of causing the publication of an obscene book. Each was fined £100. In the court case, Chase was supported by literary figures such as H. E. Bates and John Betjeman. Later, the Anglo-American crime author Raymond Chandler successfully claimed that Chase had lifted a section of his work in \"Blonde's Requiem\" (published 1945) forcing Chase to issue an apology in \"The Bookseller\".\n\nBy the end of World War II, eleven Chase titles had been published and he decided to adopt a different writing approach. All of his books to date had been compared to each other, and he wanted to move away from the American gangster scene to the London underworld that had sprung up following the end of German hostilities. He wrote \"More Deadly Than the Male\" under a new pseudonym, Ambrose Grant, and it was published in 1947 by Eyre and Spottiswoode, Graham Greene's publisher at that time. Alerted to Grant's new book, Greene gave it high praise as did the critics who, at the time, had no idea that Chase was the author. Contrary to rumour, the two authors did not know each other at the time, though they then became friends for the remainder of their lives, as Chase's papers and letters reveal. In the early 1960s, both men were caught up in an investment scandal involving Tom Roe which was to lead to Greene's tax exile beginning in 1966.\n\nIn one of the chapters of \"The Wary Transgressor\" (1952) Chase gave a portrayal of a fanatical British General that was lifted by Hans Hellmut Kirst in his novel \"The Night of the Generals\" (which later became a film starring Peter O'Toole in the title role). Chase (who had nothing whatsoever to do with the making of the film) threatened a lawsuit, and Kirst subsequently acknowledged Chase's original idea in his book, as did Columbia Pictures, who included a credit that the plot of the film stemmed from an original Chase idea.\n\nThe first cut of Joseph Losey's 1962 film version of Chase's thriller \"Eve\" (1945), \"Eva\" was considered too long, at 155 minutes, and the producers, the Hakim Brothers, insisted it not only be withdrawn from the Venice Film Festival, but be severely cut. When the film finally opened in Paris at 116 minutes, it was described as the most traumatic disaster of Losey's career. The original book was a psychological study of a prostitute (Chase, with his wife's blessing, picked out a \"lady of the night\" and offered her £5 and a good lunch if she would let him pick her brains). Set in America, the film version was moved to Venice and starred Stanley Baker as a Welsh writer obsessed with a cold-hearted femme fatale, Eve (Jeanne Moreau).\n\nAll of his novels were so fast-paced that the reader was compelled to turn the pages in a non-stop effort to reach the end of the book. The final page often produced a totally unexpected plot twist that would invariably leave even his most die-hard fans surprised. His early books contained some violence that matched the era in which they were written, though this was considerably toned down as plots centred more on circumstantial situations to create the high degree of tension that was the hallmark of his writing. Sex was never explicit and, though often hinted at, seldom happened.\n\nIn several of Chase's stories, the protagonist tries to get rich by committing a crime — an insurance fraud or a theft. But the scheme invariably fails and leads to a murder and finally to a cul-de-sac, in which the hero realises that he never had a chance to keep out of trouble. Women are often beautiful, clever, and treacherous; they kill unhesitatingly if they have to cover a crime. His plots typically centre around dysfunctional families, and the final denouement echoes the title.\n\nIn many of his novels, treacherous women play a significant role. The protagonist falls in love with one and is prepared to kill someone at her behest. Only when he has killed, does he realise that the woman was manipulating him for her own ends.\n\nChase's best market was France (more than 30 books were made into movies) where all of his ninety titles were published by Éditions Gallimard in their Série noire series. He was also very popular in other European markets, as well as Africa and Asia. Following perestroika, Centrepolygraph in Russia contracted to publish all his titles. However, his books failed to take hold in the American market.\n\n\n\n"}

The intraplate earthquake caused 60 deaths and $5–6 million ($ million in ) in damage to 2,000 buildings in the Southeastern United States. It is one of the most powerful and damaging earthquakes to hit the East Coast of the United States. Very little to no historical earthquake activity had occurred, which is unusual for any seismic area.\n\nThe shock was felt as far away as Boston, Massachusetts, to the north, Chicago, Illinois, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to the northwest, as far as New Orleans, Louisiana, to the west, as far as Cuba to the south, and as far as Bermuda to the east. It was so severe that outside the immediate area, there was speculation that the Florida peninsula had broken away from North America.\n\nIt is a heavily studied example of an intraplate earthquake and is believed to have occurred on faults formed during the break-up of Pangaea. Similar faults are found all along the east coast of North America. It is thought that such ancient faults remain active from forces exerted on them by present-day motions of the North American Plate. The exact mechanisms of intraplate earthquakes are a subject of much ongoing research.\n\nSand boils were common throughout the affected area due to soil liquefaction. Aftershocks continued to be felt for weeks after the event and minor earthquake activity that still continues in the area today may be a continuation of aftershocks. There were at least 60 fatalities.\n\nWithin the city almost all of the buildings sustained damage and most had to be torn down and rebuilt. Wires were cut and the railroad tracks were torn apart, cutting residents off from the outside world and vice versa.

Nowadays, the ceremony is often parlayed into a media event for public relations purposes. It has since come to mean more generally finishing the structure of the building, whether there is a ceremony or not.\n\nThe practice of \"topping out\" a new building can be traced to the ancient Scandinavian religious rite of placing a tree atop a new building to appease the tree-dwelling spirits displaced in its construction. Long an important component of timber frame building, it migrated initially to England and Northern Europe, thence to the Americas.\n\nA tree or leafy branch is placed on the topmost wood or iron beam, often with flags and streamers tied to it. A toast is usually drunk and sometimes workers are treated to a meal. In masonry construction the rite celebrates the bedding of the last block or brick.\n\nIn some cases a topping out event is held at an intermediate point, such as when the roof is dried-in, which means the roof can provide at least semi-permanent protection from the elements.\n\nThe practice remains common in the United Kingdom and assorted Commonwealth countries such as Australia and Canada, as well as Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Iceland, Chile, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and the Baltic States. In the United States the last beam of a skyscraper is often painted white and signed by all the workers involved. In New Zealand, completion of the roof to a water-proof state is celebrated through a \"roof shout\", where workers are treated to cake and beer.\n\nThe tradition of \"\"pannenbier\"\" (literally \"(roof) tile beer\" in Dutch) is popular in the Netherlands and Flanders, where a national, regional or city flag is hung once the highest point of a building is reached. It stays in place until the building's owner provides free beer to the workers, after which it is lowered. It is considered greedy if it remains flown for more than a few days.\n\n\n"}

The 52-story building is situated on a plaza overlooking the Chicago River. At 695 feet (211.8 meters), 330 North Wabash is the second-tallest building by Mies van der Rohe, the tallest being the Toronto-Dominion Bank Tower at Toronto-Dominion Centre. It was his last American building.\n\nThe building's original corporate namesake no longer owns nor has offices in the building. IBM sold IBM Plaza to the Blackstone Group in 1996. IBM all but completed its move out of IBM Plaza as of early 2006, taking up space in the new Hyatt Center building closer to Union Station. Current major tenants are the American Medical Association, Langham Chicago managed by Langham Hotels International, WeWork and law firm Latham & Watkins. \n\nThe former IBM Plaza has several design features that are rare in an office building but understandable given its original owner. The building's electrical system, environmental system, floor strength, and ceiling height (on certain floors) can support large raised floor computing centers. With even more need to contain possible electrical fires, fire safety was especially important, and asbestos was one of the most useful fire prevention materials of that era. As with most other buildings of that era, asbestos abatement is an ongoing aspect of building life, with air quality monitoring, asbestos \"mapping,\" and opportunistic asbestos removal when feasible. Also, given IBM's traditional office hours, large number of workers, and commercial interest in marketing then emerging electronic building control systems (notably the IBM Series/1 and its predecessors), the \"banked\" intelligent passenger elevator system (with separate all-floor cargo elevators) is significantly over-provisioned for a building of its size and rarely keeps anyone waiting long for service. IBM Plaza stayed dry during the 1992 Chicago Flood.\n\nIn 2007, plans were announced to convert floors two through thirteen of the 52-story building into a high-end hotel. The Langham, Chicago which opened in 2013, occupying floors two through thirteen. The Langham Hotel in the building was named the best hotel in the United States by US News in 2017.

{"id": "2321375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321375", "title": "Elastic recoil detection", "text": "Elastic recoil detection\n\nElastic Recoil Detection Analysis (ERDA), also referred to as forward recoil scattering (or, contextually, spectrometry), is an Ion Beam Analysis technique in materials science to obtain elemental concentration depth profiles in thin films. This technique is known by several different names. These names are listed below. In the technique of ERDA, an energetic ion beam is directed at a sample to be characterized and (as in Rutherford backscattering) there is an elastic nuclear interaction between the ions of beam and the atoms of the target sample. Such interactions are commonly of Coulomb nature. Depending on the kinetics of the ions, cross section area, and the loss of energy of the ions in the matter, Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis helps determine the quantification of the elemental analysis. It also provides information about the depth profile of the sample.\n\nThe incident energetic ions can have a wide range of energy from 2 MeV to 200 MeV. The energy of the beam depends on the sample to be studied. The energy of the beam should be enough to kick out (“recoil”) the atoms of the sample. Thus, ERD usually employs appropriate source and detectors to detect recoiled atoms.\n\nHowever, such experimental setup is expensive and along with a source requirement of high energy ions appears to make this technique relatively less commonly used for materials characterization, but is nevertheless commercially available. Moreover, the angle of incidence that an ion beam makes with the sample must also be taken into account for correct analysis of the sample. This is because, depending on this angle, the recoiled atoms will be collected. Although it is not very clear, the assumption for why this technique is not very well known would be due to the fact that it is hard to have a perfect combination of the source, the angle of incidence, and the detector to have the best characterization of the sample. Such problem would make the technique very time consuming and tedious.\n\nThis article provides information about ERDA that has been around for a long time, since the mid-1970s, still not very well known. The article provides detailed information about the High ion Incident ERDA. However, Low ion Incident ERDA is still not neglected. The comparative analysis of overall ERDA with other techniques such as TEM, AFM, XRR, NR, VASE, XPS, and DSIMS is also mentioned. The article briefly touches upon the history of ERDA but the main focus is on the technique itself. Comprehensive information on the instrumentation as well as its applications in elemental characterization and depth profile are provided.\n\nERDA and RBS have similar theory but minor differences in the set-up of the experiment. In case of RBS, the detector is placed in the back of the sample whereas in ERDA, the detector is placed in the front.\n\nThere are several techniques used today for characterization of materials. Combination of techniques is usually needed in order to obtain correct characterization. When comparing several techniques, important parameters like detection limit, depth resolution and lateral resolution must be taken into account. For this purpose, comparisons of several techniques have been shown in the table below.\n\nTable 1: Comparison of techniques with characteristic properties\n\nThe main characteristics of ERDA are listed below. \nSuch characteristics have led to many groups and scientists to explore applications of ERDA.\n\nERDA was first demonstrated by L’Ecuyer et al. in 1976. They had used 25-40 MeV Cl ions were used to detect the recoils in the sample. After more than three decades, ERDA has been divided into two main groups. First is the Light incident Ion ERDA (LI-ERDA) and the second is the Heavy incident Ion ERDA (HI-ERDA).\n\nLI-ERDA uses low voltage single-ended accelerators, whereas the HI-ERDA uses large tandem accelerators. These techniques were mainly developed after heavy ion accelerators were introduced in the materials research. LI-ERDA is also often performed using a relatively low energy (2 MeV) 4He beam specifically to depth profile hydrogen. In this technique, multiple detectors are used: at backscattering angles to detect heavier elements by RBS and forward (recoil) detector to simultaneously detect the recoiled hydrogen. The recoil detector for LI-ERDA typically has a “range foil” which is typically a Mylar foil placed in front of the detector for blocking scattered incident ions but allow lighter recoiling target atoms to pass through to the detector. Usually a 10 µm thick Mylar foil is able to completely stop 2.6 MeV He+ ions but allows the recoiled protons to go through with a low energy loss.\n\nHI-ERDA is more widely used compared to LI-ERDA because it can be used to study a lot more variety of elements compared to LI-ERDA. It can be used to identify heavy elements. It is used to detect recoiled target atoms and scattered beam ions using several detectors namely silicon diode detector, time-of-flight detector, gas ionization detector, etc. Such detectors are described below. Main advantage of HI-ERDA is its ability to obtain quantitative depth profiling information of all the sample elements in one measurement. Recent studies have shown that depth resolution obtained by using this technique is excellent. Depth resolution less than 1 nm can be obtained with good quantitative accuracy thus giving these techniques significant advantages over other surface analysis methods. Also, the accessible depth of 300 nm can be achieved using this technique. A wide range of ion beams including Cl, Cu, I, and Au, with different energies can be used in this technique in order for recoil to occur.\n\nIt must be noted that LI-ERDA and HI-ERDA both provide similar information. The difference in the name of the technique is only due to the type of ion beam used as a source.\n\nThe setup and the experimental conditions affect the performances of both of these techniques. Factors such as multiple scattering, and ion beam induced damage must be taken into account before obtaining the data because these processes can affect the data interpretation, quantification and the accuracy of the study. Additionally, the incident angle and the scattered angle help determine the sample surface topography. Incorporating surface topography into Ion Beam Analysis technique, a reliable characterization of layers of a surface can be obtained.\n\nERDA is very similar to RBS, but instead of detecting the projectile at the back angle, the recoils are detected in the forward direction. Doyle and Peercey in 1979 were able to establish the use of this technique for hydrogen depth profiling. Some of the prominent features of ERDA with high energy heavy ions are: \n\nERDA can overcome some of the limitations of Rutherford backscattering (RBS). ERDA has enabled depth profiling of elements from lightest elements like hydrogen up to heavy elements with high resolution in the light mass region as discussed above. Also, this technique has been highly sensitive because of the use of large area position sensitive telescope detectors This detector is used especially when the elements in the sample have similar masses. Telescope detectors are one way to distinguish such elements in the sample as it becomes extremely difficult to separate the elements using a normal detector.\n\nThe calculations that model this process are relatively simple, assuming projectile energy is in the range corresponding to Rutherford scattering. Projectile energy range for light incident ions is in 0.5-3.0 MeV range. For heavier projectile ions such as I the energy range is usually between 60-120 MeV; and for medium heavy ion beams,Cl is a common ion beam used with an energy of approximately 30 MeV. For the instrumentation section, the focus will be on heavy ion bombardment. The \"E\" transferred by projectile ions of mass \"m\" and energy \"E\" to sample atoms of mass \"m\" recoiling at an angle \"ϕ\", with respect to the incidence direction is given by the following equation.\n\nEquation 1 models the energy transfer from the incident ions striking the sample atoms and the recoiling effect of the target atoms with an angle of \"ϕ\". For heavier ions in elastic recoil detection analysis, if \"m/m\" «1, all recoiling ions have similar velocities. It can be deduced from the previous equation the maximum scattering angle, \"θ\", as equation 2 describes:\n\nUsing these parameters, absorber foils do not need to be incorporated into the instrument design. When using heavy ion beams and the parameters above, the geometry can be estimated as to allow for incident particle collision and scattering at an angle deflected away from the detector. This will prevent degradation of the detector from the more intense beam energies.\n\nThe differential elastic recoil cross-section \"σ\" is given by:\n\nwhere \"Z\" and \"Z\" are the atomic numbers of projectile and sample atoms, respectively. For \"m/m\" «1 and with approximation \"m=2Z\"; \"Z\" being the atomic number of \"Z\" and \"Z\". In equation (3) two essential consequences can be seen, first the sensitivity is roughly the same for all elements and second it has a \"Z\" dependence on the projector of the ion. This allows for the use of low energy beam currents in HI-ERDA preventing sample degradation and excessive heating of the specimen.\n\nWhen using heavy ion beams, care must be taken for beam-induced damage in sample such as sputtering or amorphization. If only nuclear interaction is taken into account, it has been shown that the ratio of recoiling to displaced atoms is independent of \"Z\" and only weakly dependent on the projectile mass of the incident ion. With heavy ion bombardment, it has been shown that the sputter yield by the ion beam on the sample increases for nonmetallic samples and enhanced radiation damage in superconductors. In any case, the acceptance angle of the detector system should be as large as possible to minimize the radiation damage. However, it may reduce the depth profiling and elemental analysis due to the ion beam not being able to penetrate the sample.\nThe figure on the right summarizes the principles of ERDA and how a spectrum is obtained.\n\nThis demand of a large acceptance angle, however, is in conflict with the requirement of optimum depth resolution dependency on the detection geometry. In the surface approximation and assuming constant energy loss the depth resolution \"δx\" can be written:\n\nwhere \"S\" is the relative energy loss factor defined by:\n\nhere, \"α\" and \"β\" are the incidence angles of the beam and exit angle of the recoiling ion respectively, connected to the scattering angle \"ϕ\" by \"ϕ=α+β\". It should be noticed here that the depth resolution depends on the relative energy resolution only, as well as the relative stopping power of incoming and outgoing ions. The detector resolution and energy broadening associated with the measuring geometry contribute to the energy spread, \"δE\". The detector acceptance angle and the finite beam spot size define a scattering angle range \"δϕ\" causing a kinematic energy spread \"δE\" according to equation 6:\n\nA detailed analysis of the different contributions to depth resolution shows that this kinematic effect is the predominant term near the surface, severely limiting the permitted detector acceptance angle, whereas energy straggling dominates the resolution at larger depth. For example, if one estimates \"δϕ\" for a scattering angle of 37.5° causing a kinematic energy shift comparable to typical detector energy resolutions of 1%, the angular spread \"δψ\" must be less than 0.4°. The angular spread can be maintained within this range by contributions from the beam spot size; however, the solid angle geometry of the detector is only 0.04 msr. Therefore, a detector system with large solid angle as well as high depth resolution may enable corrections for the kinematic energy shift.\n\nIn an elastic scattering event, the kinematics requires that the target atom is recoiled with significant energy. Equation 7 models the recoil kinematical factor that occurs during the ion bombardment.\n\nEquation 7 gives a mathematical model of the collision event when the heavier ions in the beam strike the specimen. \"K\" is termed the \"kinematical factor\" for the scattered particle (Eq. 8) with a scattering angle of \"θ\", and the recoiled particle (Eq. 9) with a recoil angle of \"Φ\". The variable \"r\" is the ratio of mass of the incident nuclei to that of the mass of the target nuclei, (Eq. 10). To achieve this recoil of particles, the specimen needs to be very thin and the geometries need to be precisely optimized to obtain accurate recoil detection. Since ERD beam intensity can damage the specimen and there has been growing interest to invest in the development of low energy beams for reducing the damage of the specimen.\n\nThe cathode is divided into two insulated halves, where particle entrance position is derived from charges induced on the left, \"l\", and right, \"r\", halves of the cathode. Using the following equation, \"x\"-coordinates of particle positions, as they enter the detector, can be calculated from charges \"l\" and \"r\" :\n\nFurthermore, the \"y\"-coordinate is calculated from the following equation due to the position independence of the anode pulses:\n\nFor transformation of the \"(x, y)\" information into scattering angle \"ϕ\" a removable calibration mask in front of the entrance window is used. This mask allows correction for \"x\" and \"y\" distortions too. For notation detail, the cathode has an ion drift time on the order of a few ms. To prevent ion saturation of the detector, a limit of 1 kHz must be applied to the number of particles entering the detector.\n\nElastic Recoil Detection Analysis was originally developed for hydrogen detection or a light element (H, He, Li, C, O, Mg, K) profiling with an absorber foil in front of the energy detector for beam suppression. Using an absorber foil prevents the higher energy ion beam from striking the detector and causing degradation. Absorber foils increase the lifetime of the detector. More advanced techniques have been implemented to negate the use of absorber foils and the associated difficulties that arise through the use of it. In most cases, medium heavy ion beams, typically Cl ions, have been used for ERDA so far with energies around 30 MeV. Depth resolution and element profiling of thin films has been greatly advanced using elastic recoil detection analysis. Figure 2, on the left, depicts the interaction of a heavy ion beam striking the sample atoms and the resulting backscattering and recoil ions.\n\nParticle accelerators, such as a magnetron or cyclotron, implement electromagnetic fields to achieve acceleration of elements. Atoms must be electrically charged (ionized) before they can be accelerated. Ionization involves the removal of electrons from the target atoms. A magnetron can be used to produce H- ions. Van de Graaff generators have also been integrated with particle accelerators, shown in figure 3, for light ion beam generation.\n\nFor heavier ion production, for example, an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) source can be used. Figure 4 shows a schematic diagram of an ECR. At the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, neutral atoms have their electrons removed using an ECR ion source. ECR works by ionizing the vapor of a desired element such as chlorine and iodine. Further, utilizing this technique metals (Au, Ag, etc.) can also be ionized using a small oven to achieve a vapor phase. The vapor is maintained within a magnetic field long enough for the atoms to be ionized by collisions with electrons. Microwaves are applied to the chamber as to keep the electrons in motion.\n\nThe vapor is introduced via injection directly into the “magnetic bottle” or the magnetic field. Circular coils provide the shape for the magnetic bottle. The coils are found at the top and bottom of the chamber with a hexapole magnet around the sides. A hexapole magnet consists of permanent magnets or superconducting coils. The plasma is contained within the magnetic trap that is formed from electric current flowing in solenoids located on the sides of the chamber. A radial magnetic field, exerted by the hexapole magnetic, is applied to the system that also confines the plasma. Acceleration of the electrons is achieved using resonance. For this to occur, the electrons must pass through a resonance zone. In this zone, their gyrofrequency or cyclotron frequency is equal to the frequency of the microwave injected into the plasma chamber. Cyclotron frequency is defined as the frequency of a charged particle moving perpendicular to the direction of a uniform magnetic field \"B\". Since the motion is always circular, cyclotron frequency-\"ω\" in radians/second-can be described by the following equation:\n\nwhere \"m\" is the mass of the particle, its charge is \"q\", and the velocity is \"v\". Ionization is a step-by-step process from collisions of the accelerated electrons with the desired vapor atoms. The gyrofrequency of an electron is calculated to be 1.76x107 Brad/second.\n\nNow that the vapor of the desired has been ionized, they must be removed from the magnetic bottle. To do this, a high voltage is between the hexapoles applied to pull out the ions from the magnetic field. The extraction of the ions, from the chamber, is carried out using an electrode system through a hole in a positively biased plasma chamber. Once the ions have been extracted from the chamber, they are then sent to the cyclotron for acceleration.\nIt is very important that the ion source used is optimal for the experiment being carried out. To perform an experiment in a practical amount of time, the ions provided from the accelerator complex should have the correct desired energy. The quality and stability of the ion beam needs to be considered carefully, due to the fact that only the ions with the correct flight trajectory can be injected in the cyclotron and accelerated to the desired energy.\n\nDuring ERDA, the idea is to place an ion beam source at a grazing angle to the sample. In this set up, the angle is calculated as to allow the incident ions to scatter off of the sample so that there is no contact made with the detector. The physical basis that has given the method its name stems from the elastic scattering of incident ions on a sample surface and detecting the recoiling sample atoms while the incident ions backscatter at such an angle, that they do not reach the detector; this is typically in reflection geometry, illustrated in figure shown:\n\nAnother method for preventing incident ions from making contact with the detector is to use an absorber foil. During analysis of the elastically recoiled particles, an absorber foil with selected specific thickness can be used to \"stop\" the heavy recoil and beam ions from reaching the detector; reducing the background noise. Incorporating an absorber into the experimental set up can be the most difficult to achieve. The stopping of the beam using either direct or scattered methods can only be accomplished without also stopping the light impurity atoms, if it is heavier (beam ions) than the impurity atoms being analyzed. There are advantages when using absorber films:\n\nThe major criterion for absorber foils used in ERDA is whether a recoiling impurity atom can be transmitted through the absorber, preferably a commercially available metal foil, while stopping heavy particles. Since the lighter atoms leave the absorber with smaller energies, the kinematic calculations do not provide much help. Favorable results have been obtained by using heavier ion beams of approximately 1 MeV/ nucleon. The best overall candidate is the Cl ion beam; although, Br would give better sensitivity by one order of magnitude compared to the Cl ion beam. The mass resolution, of the detector at \"θ= 0°\", of thin samples is \"ΔM/Δx\" ~ 0.3 amu/1000 Angstroms of the profile width. With thick samples, the mass resolution is feasible at θ≤30°. In thicker samples there is some degradation of mass resolution and slight loss of sensitivity. The detector solid angle has to be closed, but the thick sample can take more current without heating, which decreases sample degradation.\n\nOnce the ion beam has ionized target sample atoms, the sample ions are recoiled toward the detector. The beam ions are scattered at an angle that does not permit them to reach the detector. The sample ions pass through an entrance window of the detector, and depending on the type of detector used, the signal is converted into a spectrum.\n\nIn elastic recoil detection analysis, a silicon diode is the most common detector. This type of detector is commonly used, however, there are some major disadvantages when using this type of detector. For example, the energy resolution decreases significantly with a Si detector when detecting heavy recoiled ions. There is also a possibility of damage to the detector by radiation exposure. These detectors have a short functional lifetime (5–10 years) when doing heavy ion analysis. One of the main advantages of silicon detectors is their simplicity. However, they have to be used with a so-called “range foil” to range out the forward scattered heavy beam ions. Therefore, the simple range foil ERD has two major disadvantages: first, the loss of energy resolution due to the energy straggle and second, thickness inhomogeneity of the range foil, and the intrinsic indistinguishability of the signals for the various different recoiled target elements. Aside from the listed disadvantages, ERDA range foils with silicon detectors is still a powerful method and is relatively simple to work with.\n\nAnother method of detection for ERDA is time of flight (TOF)-ERD. This method does not present the same issues, as those for the silicon detector. However, the throughput of TOF detectors is limited; the detection is performed in a serial fashion (one ion in the detector at a time). The longer the TOF for ions, the better the time resolution (equivalent to energy resolution) will be. TOF spectrometers that have an incorporated solid state detector must be confined to small solid angles. When performing HI-ERDA, TOF detectors are often used and/or \"∆E/E\" detectors-such as ionization chambers. These types of detectors usually implement small solid angles for higher depth resolution. Figure 6, on the left, shows a Time-of-Flight detector commonly used in ERDA. Heavier ions have a longer flight time than the lighter ions. Detectors in modern time-of-flight instruments have improved sensitivity, temporal and spatial resolution, and lifetimes. Hi mass bipolar (high mass ion detection), Gen 2 Ultra Fast (twice as fast as traditional detectors), and High temperature (operated up to 150 °C) TOF are just a few of the commercially available detectors integrated with time-of-flight instruments. Linear and reflectron-TOF are the more common instruments used.\n\nA third type of detector is the gas ionization detector. The gas ionization detectors have some advantages over silicon detectors, for example, they are completely impervious to beam damage, since the gas can be replenished continuously. Nuclear experiments with large area ionization chambers increase the particle and position resolution have been used for many years and can easily be assimilated to any specific geometry. The limiting factor on energy resolution using this type of detector is the entrance window, which needs to be strong enough to withstand the atmospheric pressure of the gas, 20-90 mbar. Ultra-thin silicon nitride windows have been introduced, together with dramatic simplifications in the design, which have been demonstrated to be nearly as good as more complex designs for low energy ERD. These detectors have also been implemented in heavy ion Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry. Figure 7 shows the Gas Ionization chamber with Isobutane as the detector gas. \n\nThe energy resolution obtained from this detector is better than a silicon detector when using ion beams heavier than helium ions. There are various designs of ionization detectors but a general schematic of the detector consists of a transversal field ionization chamber with a Frisch grid positioned between anode and cathode electrodes. The anode is subdivided into two plates separated by a specific distance. From the anode, signals \"∆E\"(energy lost), \"E\"(residual energy after loss), and \"E\" (the total energy \"E= ΔΕ+E)\" as well as the atomic number \"Z\" can be deduced. For this specific design, the gas used was isobutane at pressures of 20-90 mbar with a flow rate that was electronically controlled, the previous figure. A polypropylene foil was used as the entrance window. It has to be noted that the foil thickness homogeneity is of more importance for the detector energy resolution than the absolute thickness. If heavy ions are used and detected, the effect of energy loss straggling will be easily surpassed by the energy loss variation, which is a direct consequence of different foil thicknesses. The cathode electrode is divided in two insulated halves, thus information of particle entrance position is derived from charges induced at the right and left halves.\n\nERDA in transmission geometry, where only the energy of the recoiling sample atoms is measured, was extensively used for contamination analysis of target foils for nuclear physics experiments. This technique is excellent for discerning different contaminants of foils used in sensitive experiments, such as carbon contamination. Using I ion beam, a profile of various elements can be obtained and the amount of contamination can be determined. High levels of carbon contamination could be associated with beam excursions on the support, such as a graphite support. This could be corrected by using a different support material. Using a Mo support, the carbon content could be reduced from 20-100 at.% to 1-2 at.% level of the oxygen contamination probably originating from residual gas components. For nuclear experiments, high carbon contamination would result in extremely high background and the experimental results would be skewed or less differentiable with the background. With ERDA and heavy ion projectiles, valuable information can be obtained on the light element content of thin foils even if only the energy of the recoils is measured.\n\nGenerally, the energy spectra of different recoil elements overlap due to finite sample thickness, therefore particle identification is necessary to separate the contributions of different elements. Common examples of analysis are thin films of TiNO-Cu and BaBiKO. TiNO-Cu films were developed at the University of Munich and are used as tandem solar absorbers. Figure 8 shows the various components to the film. The copper coating and the glass substrate was also identified. Not only is ERDA is also coupled to Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, which is a similar process to ERDA. Using a solid angle of 7.5 mrs, recoils can be detected for this specific analysis of TiNO-Cu. It is important when designing an experiment to always consider the geometry of the system as to achieve recoil detection. In this geometry and with Cu being the heaviest component of the sample, according to eq. 2, scattered projectiles could not reach the detector. To prevent pileup of signals from these recoiled ions, a limit of 500 Hz needed to be set on the count rate of ΔΕ pulses. This corresponded to beam currents of lass than 20 particle pA.\n\nAnother example of thin film analysis is of BaBiKO. This type of film showed superconductivity at one of the highest-temperatures for oxide superconductors. Elemental analysis, shown in figure 9, of this film was carried out using heavy ion-ERDA. These elemental constitutes of the polymer film (Bi, K, Mg, O, along with carbon contamination) were detected using an ionization chamber. Other than Potassium, the lighter elements are clearly separated in the matrix. From the matrix, there is evidence of a strong carbon contamination within the film. Some films showed a 1:1 ratio of K to carbon contamination. For this specific film analysis, the source for contamination was traced to an oil diffusion pump and replaced with an oil free pumping system.\n\nIn the above examples, the main focus was identification of constituent particles found in thin films and depth resolution was of less significance. Depth resolution is of great importance in applications when a profile of a samples' elemental composition, in different sample layers, has to be measured. This is a powerful tool for materials characterization. Being able to quantify elemental concentration in sub-surface layers can provide a great deal of information pertaining to chemical properties. High sensitivity, i.e. large detector solid angle, can be combined with high depth resolution only if the related kinematic energy shift is compensated.\n\nThe Basic chemistry of Forward recoil scattering process is considered to be charged particle interaction with matters.\nTo Understand Forward recoil spectrometry we should know the physics involved in Elastic and Inelastic collisions. In Elastic collision only Kinetic Energy is conserved in the scattering process and there is no role of particle internal energy. Where as in case of \nInelastic collision both kinetic energy and internal energy are participated in the scattering process.\nPhysical concepts of two-body elastic scattering are the basis of several nuclear methods for elemental material characterization.\n\nThe Fundamental aspects in dealing with recoil spectroscopy involves electron back scattering process of matter such as thin films and solid materials. Energy loss of particles in target materials is evaluated by assuming that the target sample is laterally uniform and constituted by a mono isotopic element. This allows a simple relationship between that of penetration depth profile and elastic scattering yield\n\n\nPhysical concepts that are highly important in interpretation of forward recoil spectrum are depth profile, energy straggling, and multiple scattering. These concepts are described in detail in the following sections :\n\nA key parameter that characterizes recoil spectrometry is the depth resolution. This parameter is defined as the ability of an analytical technique to measure a variation in atomic distribution as a function of depth in a sample layer.\n\nIn terms of low energy forward recoil spectrometry, hydrogen and deuterium depth profiling can be expressed in a mathematical notation.\n\nΔx = ΔE/(dE/dx)\n\nwhere δE defines as the energy width of a channel in a multichannel analyzer, and dE/dx is the effective stopping power of the recoiled particles.\n\nConsider an Incoming and outgoing ion beams that are calculated as a function of collisional depth, by considering two trajectories are in a plane perpendicular to target surface, and incoming and outgoing paths are the shortest possible ones for a given collision depth and given scattering and recoil angles .\n\nImpinging ions reach the surface, making an angle θ, with the inward-pointing normal to the surface. After collision their velocity makes an angle θ, with the outward surface normal; and the atom initially at rest recoils, making an angle θ, with this normal. Detection is possible at one of these angles as such that the particle crosses the target surface.\nPaths of particles are related to collisional depth x, measured along a normal to the surface.\n\nThis Figure is plane representation of a scattered projectile on the target surface, when both incoming and outgoing paths are in perpendicular to target surface\n\nFor the impinging ion, length of the incoming path L is given by :formula_14\n\nThe outgoing path length L of the scattered projectile is :formula_15\n\nAnd finally the outgoing path L of the recoil is :formula_16\n\nThis Figure is plane representation of a Recoiled ion path on the target surface, when both incoming and outgoing paths are in perpendicular to target surface\n\nIn this simple case a collisional plane is perpendicular to the target surface, the scattering angle of the impinging ion is θ = π-θ-θ & the recoil angle is φ = π-θ-θ.\n\nTarget angle with the collisional plane is taken as α, and path is augmented by a factor of 1/cos α.\n\nFor the purpose of converting outgoing particle in to collision depth, geometrical factors are chosen.\n\nFor recoil R(φ, α)is defined as sin L = R(φ, α)L\n\nformula_17\n\nFor forward scattering of the projectile R(φ,α)by:L = R(θ,α)L\nR(θ,α) = cos θcosα/Sin θ√(cosα-cosθ)-cosθcosθ\n\nThe Figure below is the Geometrical configuration of recoil spectrometry. Paths of scattered particles are considered to be L for incident beam, L is for scattered particle, and L is for recoiled atoms.\n\nThe energy E(x) of the incident particle at a depth (x) to its initial energy E where scattering occurs is given by the following Equations. (Tirira. J., 1996)\n\nsimilarly Energy expression for scattered particle is:formula_19\n\nand for recoil atom is:formula_20\n\nThe energy loss per unit path is usually defined as stopping power and it is represented by :formula_21\n\nSpecifically, stopping power S(E) is known as a function of the energy E of an ion.\n\nStarting point for energy loss calculations is illustrated by the expression:\n\nBy applying above equation and energy conservation Illustrates expressions in 3 cases \n\nwhere E(x)= KE(x)and E(x)=K'E(x)\n\nS(E)and S_r(E) are stopping powers for projectile and recoil in the Target material\n\nFinally stopping cross section is defined by ɛ(E)= S(E)/N\nɛ is stopping cross section factor.\n\nTo obtain energy path scale We need to evaluate energy variation δE of the outgoing beam of energy E2 from the target surface for an increment δx of collisional depth, here E remains fixed. Evidently this causes changes in path lengths L and L a variation of path around the collision point x is related to the corresponding variation in energy before scattering :\n\nδL1 = δE(x)/S[E(x)----- Equation 5\n\nMoreover, particles with slight energy differences after scattering from a depth x undergo slight energy losses on their outgoing path.\nThen change δ L3 of the path length L3 can be written as \nδL3 = δ(K’E(x)]/ Sr[K’E0(x)) + δ(E)/SE) -----Equation 6\n\nδ L1 is the path variations due to energy variation just after the collision and δ L3 is the path variation because of variation of energy loss along the outward path.\nSolving equations 5 and 6 by considering δ x = 0 for the derivative dL1/dE2 with L3=R(φα)L1,yields\n\ndL1/dE2 = 1/{S(E)/S[K’E(x)]}{[R(φ,α) S[K’E(x)+K’S[E(x)]} -----------Equation 7\n\nIn elastic spectrometry, the term[S] is called as energy loss factor\n[S] = K’S(E(x))/Cos θ + S(K’E(x))2Cos θ -----------------Equation 8\n\nfinally stopping cross section is defined by ε(E) ≡S(E)/N\nwhere N is atomic density of the target material.\n\nStopping cross section factor [ε] = ((K^'ε(E(x) ))/cos θ )+(ε(K^' E(x) )/cosθ)--------Equation 9\n\nAn important parameter that characterizes recoil spectrometer is depth resolution. It is defined as the ability of an analytical technique to detect a variation in atomic distribution as a function of depth. The capability to separate in energy in the recoil system arising from small depth intervals. The expression for depth resolution is given as\n\nδR = δE/[{S(E)/SK'E(x)}][R(φ,α)SK'E(x)+K'SE(x)]-----------Equation 10\n\nWhere δE is the total energy resolution of the system, and the huge expression in the denominator is the sum of the path integrals of initial, scattered and recoil ion beams.\n\nThe concept of depth resolution represents the ability of Recoil spectrometry to separate the energies of scattered particles that occurred at slightly different depths\nδRx is interpreted as an absolute limit for determining concentration profile. From this point of view concentration profile separated by a depth interval of the order of magnitude of δRx would be undistinguishable in the spectrum, and obviously it is impossible to gain accuracy better than δRx to assign depth profile. In particular the fact that the signals corresponding to features of the concentration profile separated by less than δRx strongly overlap in the spectrum.\n\nA finite final depth resolution resulting from both theoretical and experimental limitations has deviation from exact result when consider an ideal situation. Final resolution is not coincide with theoretical evaluation such as the classical depth resolution δRx precisely because it results from three terms that escape from theoretical estimations: \n\nStraggling: Energy loss of particle in a dense medium is statistical in nature due to a large number of individual collisions between the particle and sample. Thus the evolution of an initially mono energetic and mono directional beam leads to dispersion of energy and direction. The resulting statistical energy distribution or deviation from initial energy is called energy straggling. Energy straggling data are plotted as a function of depth in the material.\n\nTheories of energy straggling : Energy straggling distribution is divided into three domains depending on the ratio of ΔE i.e., ΔE /E where ΔE is the mean energy loss and E is the average energy of the particle along the trajectory.\n\n1. Low fraction of energy loss: for very thin films with small path lengths, where ΔE/E ≤ 0.01, Landau and Vavilov derived that infrequent single collisions with large energy transfers contributes certain amount of loss in energy.\n\n2. Medium fraction of energy loss: for regions where 0.01< ΔE/E ≤ 0.2. Bohr’s model based on electronic interactions is useful for estimating energy straggling for this case, and this model includes the amount of energy straggling in terms of the areal density of electrons traversed by the beam. \nThe standard deviation ΩB of the energy distribution is given by : ΩB=4π((Ze)NZ∆x\nWhere NZΔx is the number of electrons per unit area over the path length increment Δx.\n\n3. Large fraction of energy loss: for fractional energy loss in the region of 0.2< ΔE/E ≤ 0.8, the energy dependence of stopping power causes the energy loss distribution to differ from Bohr’s straggling function. Hence the Bohr theory can not be applicable for this case. Various theoretical advances were made in understanding energy straggling in this case.\nAn expression of energy for straggling is proposed by Symon in the region of 0.2< ΔE/E ≤ 0.5 is a function of momentums Mi( Mi = M+M where M is stopping power, M is variation in straggling with depth of a stopping power)\n\nTschalar et al. derived a straggling function solving the differential equation:\nd Ω/dx = S(E) .d Ω/dE\n\nThe Tschalar’s expression which is valid for nearly symmetrical energy loss spectra, is\nΩ T = S[E(x)]σ(E) dE/S(E)\n\nWhere σ(E) represents energy straggling per unit length (or) variance of energy loss distribution per unit length for particles of energy E. E(x)is the mean energy at depth x.\n\nIn a similar way mass resolution is a parameter that characterizes the capability of recoil spectrometry to separate two signals arising from two neighboring elements in the target. The difference in the energy δE of recoil atoms after collision when two types of atoms differ in their masses by a quantity δM is\n\nδE/ δM = E (dK’/dM)\n\nδE/ δM = 4E(M(M-M)cosφ/(M+M)\n\nMass resolution δMR (≡ δE/ δM).\n\nA main limitation of using low beam energies is the reduced mass resolution. The energy separation of different masses is, in fact, directly proportional to the incident energy. The mass resolution is limited by the relative E and velocity v.\n\nExpression for mass resolution is ΔM = √(∂M/∂E.∆E) + √(∂M/∂v.∆v)\n\nΔM = M(√((∆E)/E)+√(2.∆v/v))\n\nE is the Energy, M is the mass and v is the velocity of the particle beam.and ΔM is reduced mass difference.\n\nWhen an Ion beam penetrating in to matter, ions undergo successive scattering events and deviates from original direction. The beam of ions in initial stage are well collimated(single direction), but after passing through a thickness of Δx in a random medium their direction of light propagation certainly differs from normal direction . As a result, both angular and lateral deviations from the initial direction can occur. These two parameters are discussed below. Hence, path length will be increased than expected causing fluctuations in ion beam. This process is called multiple scattering, and it is statistical in nature due to the large number of collisions.\n\nLateral displacement Case 1\n\nIon beam fluctuations because of lateral deviations on Target surface is explained by considering Multiple scattering of an ion beam which is directed in x – direction.\n\nAngular deviation Case 2\n\nIn the below figure there is a considerable difference between in the shape area of Gaussian peak (ideal condition) and angularly deviated peak. and α is an angle due to angular deviation of a penetrated ion beam through matter.\n\nIn the study of Multiple Scattering phenomenon angular distribution of a beam is important quantity for Consideration. The lateral distribution is closely related to the angular one but secondary to it, since lateral displacement is a consequence of angular divergence. Lateral distribution represents the beam profile in the matter. both lateral and angular Multiple scattering distributions are interdependent.\n\nThe analysis of Multiple Scattering was started by Bothe(Bothe, W,1921) and Wentzel (Wentzel, G,1922)in the Nineteen twenties using well-known approximation of small angles. The physics of energy straggling and Multiple Scattering was developed quite far by Williams from 1929 to 1945. Williams devised a theory, which consists of fitting the Multiple Scattering distribution as a Gaussian-like portion due to small scattering angles and the single collision tail due to the large angles. William, E.J., studied beta particle straggling, Multiple scattering of fast electrons and alpha particles, and cloud curvature tracks due to scattering to explain Multiple scattering in different scenario and he proposed a mean projection deflection occurrence due to scattering. His theory later extended to multiple scattering of alpha particles.\nGoudsmit and Saunderson provided a more complete treatment of Multiple Scattering, including large angles. For large angles Goudsmit considered series of Legendre polynomials which are numerically evaluated for distribution of scattering. The angular distribution from Coulomb scattering has been studied in detail by Molière.,(Molière:1948) and further continued by Marion and coworkers. Marion, J.B., and Young, F.C., in their Nuclear Reaction Analysis provided Tabular information regarding energy loss of charged particles in matter, Multiple scattering of charged particles, Range straggling of protons, deuterons and alpha particles, equilibrium charge states of ions in solids and energies of elastically scattered particles. Scott presents a complete review of basic theory, Mathematical methods, as well as results and applications.\nA comparative development of Multiple Scattering at small angles is presented by Meyer, based on a classical calculation of single cross section. Sigmund and Winterbon reevaluated Meyer’s calculation to extend it to a more general case. Marwick and Sigmund carried out development on lateral spreading by Multiple Scattering, which resulted in a simple scaling relation with the angular distribution.\n\nHI-ERDA and LI-ERDA have similar applications. As mentioned previously, the only difference between the two techniques is energy of the source used for the bombardment of the sample.\n\nERDA, in general, has many applications in the areas of polymer science, material science – semiconductor materials, electronics, and thin film characterization. ERDA is widely used in polymer science. This is because polymers are hydrogen-rich materials which can be easily studied by LI-ERDA. One can examine surface properties of polymers, polymer blends and evolution of polymer composition induced by irradiation. HI-ERDA can also be used in the field of new materials processed for microelectronics and opto-electronic applications. Moreover, elemental analysis and depth profiling in thin film can also be performed using ERDA.\n\nAn example of how ERDA can be used by scientists is shown below. In one of the experiments performed by Compsoto, et al., ERDA spectrum was obtained for a thin film of polystyrene (PS) on a deuterated polystyrene (dPS) matrix after annealing for 240 seconds at 171C. This spectrum is shown in figure 16 on the left.\n\nIt must be noted that the plot above is simply the normalized yield at each channel number from a thin dPS layer (about 200 Angstroms) on top of a thick PS. Normalized yield is usually the number of atoms detected. Channeling, however occurs when a beam of ions is carefully aligned with a major symmetry direction of a single crystal, such as a crystal axis or a plane. In this condition, most of the beam is steered through the channels formed by the string of atoms. Channeled particles cannot get close enough to the atomic nuclei to undergo scattering. Several mathematical operations were then performed, electronically, to obtain a concentration versus depth-profile as shown below in figure 17. Please refer to the source for detailed explanation of the mathematical equations.\n\nIn addition to all these applications, ERDA is one of the methods to follow elemental transport mechanism. More importantly, hydrogen transport near interfaces induced by corrosion and wear can be probed using ERDA. ERDA can also be used to perform composition diagnosis in various media.\n\nCharacterizing how polymer molecules behave at free polymer surfaces at interfaces between incompatible polymers and at interfaces with inorganic solid substances is crucial to our fundamental understanding and for improving the performance of polymers in high-tech applications. For example, the adhesion of two polymers strongly depends on the interactions occurring at the interface, between polymer segments. LI-ERDA is one of the most attractive methods for investigating these aspects of polymer science quantitatively.\n\nA typical LI- ERDA spectrum obtained using this technique to study elemental concentration and depth profile of polymers is shown in the figure 18 below. It is ERDA spectra of a thin (20 nm) dPS tracer film on a thick (500 nm) PS matrix.\n\nHydrogen and deuterium profiles can be measured using various polymer blends by using this technique. Green and Russel have studied the segregation of deuterated polystyrene/polymethamethacrylate copolymer at the interface of polystyrene, and polymethylmethacrylate homopolymer at the interface of polystyrene and polymethylmetacrylate homopolymer using ERDA with 2.8 MeV 4He+ ions. They also studied the interface properties of copolymers/Al or Si structures. Figure 19 shows the results obtained which is a typical ERD spectrum of yield vs. energy of P(d-S-b-d-MMA) block copolymer chains that segregated at the interface of the PS and PMMA homopolymers.\n\nThis profile can then be converted to volume fraction versus depth after doing several mathematical operations to obtain figure 20. In the figure 20 shown, the shaded region is the interface excess. The PS phase is located at x<0 whereas the PMMA phase is located at x>0. Please refer to the source to obtain complete analysis of the figure.\n\nThus the authors were able to see that copolymer chains segregate to the interfacial region between the PS and PMMA homolymer phases and elevated temperatures while others remain in bulk. Similar studies can be easily done using the technique of ERDA\n\nThe profile that lies in the energy range between 600 and 1000 keV is the hydrogen from the homopolymers and the other profile, which lies between 1000 and 1400 keV, is that of the deuterium from the copolymer chains.\n\nIon implantation is one of the methods used to transform physical properties of polymers and to improve their electrical, optical, and mechanical performance. Ion implantation is a technique by which the ions of a material are accelerated in an electrical field and impacted into a materials such that ion are inserted into this material. This technique has many important uses. One such example is the introduction of silver plasma into the biomedical titanium. This is important because Titanium-based implantable devices such as joint prostheses, fracture fixation devices and dental implants, are important to human lives and improvement of the life quality of patients. However, biomedical titanium is lack of Osseo integration and antibacterium ability. Plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) is a physical technique which can enhance the multi-functionality, mechanical and chemical properties as well as biological activities of artificial implants and biomedical devices. ERDA can be used to study this phenomenon very effectively. Moreover, many scientists have measured the evolution of electrical conductivity, optical transparency, corrosion resistance, and wear resistance of different polymers after irradiation by electron or low-energy light ions or high-energy heavy ions.\n\nElectronic devices are usually composed of sequential thin layers made up of oxides, nitrides, silicades, metals, polymers, or doped semiconductor–based media coated on a single crystalline substrate (Si, Ge or AsGa). These structures can be studied by HI-ERDA. This technique has one major advantage over other methods. The profile of impurities can be found in a one-shot measurement at a constant incident energy. Moreover, this technique offers an opportunity to study the density profiles of hydrogen, carbon and oxygen in various materials, as well as the absolute hydrogen, carbon and oxygen content.\n\nCombination of techniques is required in order to study the composition of thin films. Ion beam techniques – RBS and elastic recoil detection analysis combination has proved to be an attractive way to study the elemental composition of the samples as well as the depth profiles of the thin films. ERDA technique is capable of separating masses and energies of scattered incident ions and the recoiled target atoms. It is especially useful to profile light elements such as H, B, C, N, and O in the presence of heavier material background. Thus it has proved to be a useful technique in studying the composition of the thin films. The dependence of the hydrogen density profile on the features of processing and maintenance, and the effect of injected hydrogen on the dielectric properties of ditantalum pentoxide can also be studied.\n\n"}

{"id": "2321381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321381", "title": "Houston Ballet", "text": "Houston Ballet\n\nHouston Ballet, operated by Houston Ballet Foundation, is the fourth-largest professional ballet company in the United States, based in Houston, Texas. The foundation also maintains a ballet academy, the Houston Ballet Academy, which trains more than half of the company's dancers. As of 2017, the Houston Ballet's endowment at more than $73 million is considered among the largest endowments held for a dance company in the US. The company produces over 85 performances each year and consists of 59 dancers.\n\nHouston developed its taste for professional ballet beginning in the 1930s with Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. For a span of eleven years, Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo spent a week during the Christmas season in Houston performing for Houston audiences. From this exposure grew a desire among patrons for a resident dance company. In the spring of 1955, Tatiana Semenova, a former dancer with Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, was invited to start a ballet school in Houston. Semenova accepted and a state charter was obtained to establish a Houston Foundation for Ballet on July 26, 1955.\n\nUnder Semenova's direction, the Foundation trained young dancers in ballet technique and reached out to under-served students, establishing a scholarship program with the Neighborhood Centers Association to train students at Ripley House in Houston's East End, later advancing selected students into the school. Semenova remained director through 1966.\n\nIn 1967, Nina Popova, another alumna of Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, was selected as the Foundation's next Artistic Director with the understanding that she was to create a company of professional dancers. By mid-December 1967, Popova had trained a corps of students and recruited students from other Houston dance studios to perform in an elegant full-length production of \"Giselle,\" featuring star dancers from American Ballet Theatre: Carla Fracci and Erik Bruhn as Giselle and Albrecht, Cynthia Gregory as Myrtha, and Terry Orr and Mariana Tcherkassky dancing the \"Peasant\" \"pas de deux\".\n\nBy 1968, Popova began selecting and training dancers for a professional company. Auditions for dancers were held during the fall of 1968 in Houston, Dallas, New York and Los Angeles. Sixteen dancers began the first season and made their debut on February 17, 1969, at Sam Houston State Teachers College in Huntsville, Texas. This performance launched their statewide tour to 23 cities, which concluded with their Jones Hall premiere on May 14, 1969.\n\nThe company included four Academy-trained Houstonians, with imported dancers Judith Aaen and Anthony Sellers as Principals. In April 1972, Henry Holth, former Manager of Boston Ballet, was appointed as the executive head of Houston Ballet Foundation. That same year, Houston Ballet performed Frederic Franklin’s \"Nutcracker\" for six post-Christmas performances in Jones Hall. These were Houston Ballet's first performances with a live orchestra.\n\nBy 1973, Houston Ballet's business offices had moved into Jones Hall. In order to attract a larger audience, guest stars were invited to perform with the company. Cynthia Gregory, Dame Margot Fonteyn, Desmond Kelly, Allegra Kent, Edward Villella, Natalia Makarova and Ivan Nagy all guested during the next few seasons. More solo and leading dancers were added to the company, notably the Finnish couple Leo Ahonen and Soili Arvola.\n\nAfter Popova resigned in February 1975, James Clouser, who had been a regular ballet master and a popular choreographer with both the dancers and audiences, was named interim Artistic Director while the board searched for Popova's replacement.\n\nThe board's artistic committee ultimately chose British-born Ben Stevenson as the next Artistic Director because of his classical foundation, his intense interest in training Academy students, and his international contacts that would attract the best talent to Houston. Clouser resigned after Stevenson was appointed, but not before Houston Ballet's world premiere of his rock ballet, \"Caliban,\" in May 1976.\n\nStevenson's goal of building a company by training its dancers in a resident academy won full support from Houston Ballet Foundation's trustees, and he ultimately succeeded in bringing the company to maturity. But it took time to achieve that goal. Having retained only 12 of the 28 dancers from Houston Ballet's Popova/Clouser years, Stevenson had to import nearly two-thirds of his company members.\n\nInitially, four of the five Principals were retained: Leo Ahonen, Soili Arvola, Matti Tikkanen, and Andrea Vodehnal, who had begun her childhood training in Houston. Several dancers from companies Stevenson had previously worked with followed him to Houston and became leading members of Houston Ballet over the next five to ten years. These dancers included Soloists: Suzanne Longley, Rosemary Miles, Janie Parker and Dorio Pérez; and five Corps de Ballet dancers: Michael Bjerknes, Thomas Boyd, Jennifer Holmes, William Pizzuto and Kristine Richmond.\n\nFor the next eleven years, Stevenson would choreograph several full-length ballets on the company: \"Cinderella, The Nutcracker, The Sleeping Beauty, Swan Lake,\" and \"Peer Gynt\". \"Peer Gynt\" was Stevenson's first original story ballet. He also staged more than 20 of his own one-act ballets while also engaging some of the most important choreographers of the time: Ronald Hynd, Barry Moreland, Hans van Manen, John Cranko, and Sir Frederick Ashton.\n\nIn 1980, former Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo executive J. B. Cerrone became General Manager of the company. During his tenure the number of dancers, budget, and size of the orchestra grew tremendously.\n\nHouston Ballet shared Jones Hall with the Houston Symphony, Houston Grand Opera, and the Society for the Performing Arts. In 1987, the Wortham Theater Center opened and became Houston Ballet's new performance home. The company launched its 1987-88 season on the new Wortham Theater Center's Brown Theater stage on September 2, 1987, with Stevenson's production of \"Romeo and Juliet,\" with Li Cunxin and Janie Parker in the title roles.\n\nThe opening of Wortham Theater Center marked the beginning of a new era for Houston Ballet. The dancers finally had a sprung dance floor, a deeper stage, ample backstage space, and an expanded lighting grid - improvements that created new production possibilities. Stevenson engaged Desmond Heeley to redesign and enhance the production quality of his staging of \"The Nutcracker\". This production premiered on December 4, 1987, and would be performed annually by the company for the next 30 years.\n\nIn 1989, Houston Ballet appointed British choreographers Sir Kenneth MacMillan as Artistic Associate and Christopher Bruce as Associate Choreographer. Together, they brought modern influences to Houston Ballet's repertoire. Bruce introduced numerous works into Houston Ballet's repertoire over the next two decades, and MacMillan added five ballets, including his full-length \"Manon.\"\n\nThroughout the remaining 14 years of his directorship, Stevenson blended elegant new productions of classic ballets – notably \"La Sylphide, Cinderella, The Sleeping Beauty, La Fille Mal Gardée,\" and \"Don Quixote\" - with world premieres of several of his original full-length and shorter ballets: \"Alice in Wonderland\" (1992), \"Dracula\" (1997), and \"The Snow Maiden\" (1998). Finally, he choreographed \"Cleopatra\" (1999) for Lauren Anderson.\n\nStevenson increased the number of guest choreographers by contracting works from internationally known dance-makers: Glen Tetley, James Kudelka, Paul Taylor, Jerome Robbins, Jiří Kylián, Lila York, William Forsythe, Natalie Weir, Brian Enos, Nacho Duato, David Parsons, Houston-born David Roussève, Farrell Dyde, Gillian Lynne, and Stanton Welch.\n\nDuring his tenure, Stevenson also nurtured the choreographic careers of several of his dancers: Daniel Jamison, William Pizzuto, Barbara Bears, Sean Kelly, Ken Kempe, Timothy O’Keefe, Sandra Organ, Kristine Richmond, Dominic Walsh, and Trey McIntyre. Organ and Walsh went on to establish their own companies in Houston, and McIntyre's choreography was added to the repertoires of several major companies. He formed his own company in Idaho in 2005, after serving eight years as Houston Ballet's Choreographic Associate.\n\nIn 1995, Cecil C. Conner, Jr., was appointed as Managing Director bringing to Houston Ballet a professional background in law and several years managing Joffrey Ballet. Under Conner's leadership, Houston Ballet retired its accumulated deficit and quadrupled the company's endowment. During his 17-year tenure, Conner organized 12 tours both within the United States and internationally, greatly raising the company's artistic profile and led the effort to build Houston Ballet's state-of-the-art facility, the Center for Dance. Following his retirement in 2012, Conner continued in an advisory capacity as Managing Director Emeritus.\n\nPersonal recognition from Great Britain came to Stevenson in 2000, when Queen Elizabeth II named him an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). In July 2003, Stevenson stepped down as Artistic Director, assuming the title of Artistic Director Emeritus of Houston Ballet. Stanton Welch AM became Houston Ballet's fifth Artistic Director.\n\nBen Stevenson now serves as the Artistic Director of Texas Ballet Theater in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nJanie Parker joined the company in 1976, Stevenson's first season as Artistic Director. She would quickly rise to Principal and danced with Houston Ballet for the next 20 years. She performed all of the title roles and had several ballets created on her. When Li Cunxin joined the company, Stevenson regularly paired them together. They were the leading partnership of Houston Ballet during their time.\n\nLi Cunxin became one of Houston Ballet's shining stars, dancing with the company for 16 years. In 1979, Stevenson had traveled to China on behalf of Columbia University’s Cultural Exchange Center to teach a month of classes at the Beijing Academy of Dance. Upon his return, he invited two Chinese students, Li Cunxin and Zhang Weiqiang, for summer classes at Houston Ballet Academy. Li’s strong technique won him an extended stay, but his sudden marriage to a fellow Academy student and his refusal to return to China when his visa expired briefly causing an international incident. When the issue was resolved in Li’s favor, he was permitted to join Houston Ballet and quickly rose to become the company’s most popular Principal male dancer of his time. The incident is recounted both in Li’s 2003 autobiography, \"Mao’s Last Dancer\", and feature film based upon it.\n\nLauren Anderson began her training at the age of seven at Houston Ballet Academy. In 1983, she was asked to join the company and became the company’s second African-American dancer, following Sandra Organ who had joined Houston Ballet in 1982. In 1990, Anderson was promoted to Principal dancer, becoming the company’s first African-American Principal.\n\nIn 1993, Stevenson appointed Cuban sensation Carlos Acosta as a new Principal. Acosta and Anderson became a show-stopping pair; their dancing won accolades – at home as well as on national and international tours. It also brought praise from major U.S. dance critics for Stevenson’s leadership among American ballet companies in featuring black dancers at Houston Ballet’s highest level.\n\nAnderson retired in 2006 at the age of 41. Upon her retirement, she was appointed Outreach Associate for Houston Ballet. In 2015, she was named Program Manager for the Education and Community Engagement department with Houston Ballet.\n\nAnderson’s signed pointe shoes were included in the permanent collection at the Smithsonian Institute’s National Museum of African American History and Culture. Other memorabilia from Anderson's career will be included in temporary exhibits.\n\nIn July 2003, Australian choreographer Stanton Welch assumed the leadership of Houston Ballet as Artistic Director. Since his arrival, Welch has transformed Houston Ballet by raising the level of classical technique; introducing works by distinguished and emerging choreographers such as Aszure Barton, David Bintley, Alexander Ekman, Nicolo Fonte, Tim Harbour, Edwaard Liang, Mark Morris, John Neumeier, Justin Peck, Garret Smith, and Twyla Tharp; adding to the company's repertoire important ballets by Kylián, Robbins, and others; and attracting some of the world's best coaches to work with the dancers. He has also increased the number of dancers, performances, and destinations on international tours.\n\nSince his designation as Artistic Director, Welch has premiered six full-lengths and more than 20 one-act ballets. His full-lengths include \"The Nutcracker, Giselle, Romeo & Juliet, Marie, Swan Lake,\" and \"La Bayadère\". Almost all of Welch's full-length ballets have toured both nationally and internationally. In 2016, Welch returned home to Australia with the entire Houston Ballet company to tour his critically acclaimed 2015 staging of \"Romeo & Juliet\" to Melbourne and Sydney. In October 2018, Welch will lead the company on a tour to Dubai, United Arab Emirates for performances of his \"Swan Lake.\"\n\nIn October 2013, Welch's two-act ballet, \"Sons de L’âme,\" had its world premiere at the historic Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris, France. Welch choreographed the evening-length ballet to music by Frédéric Chopin, which was performed by internationally acclaimed pianist Lang Lang. This special production was broadcast live on television across several European countries and was then formatted into a documentary film.\n\nFor his contributions to the world of dance, Welch was awarded the Order of Australia (AM) in June 2015. The prestigious Order of Australia Award is bestowed on Australian citizens for meritorious service in a particular area or field of activity. Welch was recognized for his significant service to the performing arts as a ballet dancer, mentor, choreographer, and artistic director.\n\nIn 2012, James Nelson was promoted from General Manager of Houston Ballet to the role of Executive Director. Through his leadership, Nelson has successfully guided the company financially through growth in the number of dancers and of performances and through several international tours, while also navigating the largest threat to Houston Ballet's financial stability, Hurricane Harvey.\n\nDuring 2019-20, Stanton Welch AM and James Nelson will lead Houston Ballet into its 50th anniversary.\n\nChoreographer: Stanton Welch AM\n\nMusic: Léo Delibes\n\nFeb. 21-March 3, 2019\n\n\"Fancy Free\"\n\nChoreographer: Jerome Robbins\n\nMusic: Leonard Bernstein\n\n\"The Cage\" (Houston Ballet Premiere)\n\nChoreographer: Jerome Robbins\n\nMusic: Igor Stravinsky\n\n\"The Concert (or the Perils of Everybody)\"\n\nChoreographer: Jerome Robbins\n\nMusic: Frédéric Chopin\n\nMarch 7–10, 2019\n\n\"Come In\" (Houston Ballet Premiere)\n\nChoreographer: Aszure Barton\n\nMusic: Vladimir Martynov\n\n\"Dream Time\" (Houston Ballet Premiere)\n\nChoreographer: Jiří Kylián\n\nMusic: Tōru Takemitsu\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nChoreographer: Justin Peck\n\nMusic: TBA\n\nMarch 21–24, 2019\n\nChoreographer: Ben Stevenson, OBE, after Arthur Saint-Léon\n\nMusic: Léo Delibes\n\nMay 17–26, 2019\n\nChoreographer: Ronald Hynd\n\nMusic: Franz Lehár\n\nMay 31-June 9, 2019\n\nChoreographer: Stanton Welch AM\n\nMusic: Dmitri Shostakovich, arranged by Ermanno Florio\n\nJune 14–23, 2019\n\nOn March 21, 1956, Tatiana Semenova presented 12 student dancers (six girls, six boys) in the first dance recital for Houston Foundation for Ballet.\n\nOn February 17, 1969, Nina Popova's newly formed professional company debuted at Sam Houston State Teachers College in Huntsville, Texas, which launched their Texas tour consisting of 23-city tour of the state. They concluded the tour with their first performance in Jones Hall on May 14, 1969.\n\nBy 1971-72, Houston Ballet was dancing a 26-week season with an expanded 18-member company.\n\nBy the end of the 1973-74 season, the number of dancers had increased to 32.\n\nBen Stevenson presented a company of 28 dancers in his first year as Artistic Director. During the next 11 years, Stevenson would grow the company, and in his final year as Artistic Director, the number of dancers was 52.\n\nAfter his appointment as Artistic Director, Stanton Welch continued to grow the size of the company. In 2015, Houston Ballet implemented a five-year strategic plan with goals to expand the company to 65 dancers by 2020. As of the 2016-17 season, Houston Ballet had contracted 59 dancers (approximately half women and half men).\n\nHouston Ballet ranks their dancers in the following categories, beginning with entry level: Apprentice, Corps de Ballet, Demi Soloist, Soloist, First Soloist, and Principal.\n\nIn the 2017-18 season, Houston Ballet's Principal dancers are Ian Casady, Chun Wai Chan, Jessica Collado, Karina González, Yuriko Kajiya, Jared Matthews, Melody Mennite, Connor Walsh, Sara Webb, and Charles-Louis Yoshiyama\n\nSince its inception, Houston Ballet has toured the following places:\n\nArkansas\n\nArizona\n\nCalifornia\n\nColorado\n\nConnecticut\n\nFlorida\n\nIowa\n\nIllinois\n\nIndiana\n\nKansas\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisiana\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMichigan\n\nMinnesota\n\nMissouri\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nNebraska\n\nNew Mexico\n\nNew York\n\nOhio\n\nOklahoma\n\nOregon\n\nPennsylvania\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nTennessee\n\nTexas\n\nVirginia\n\nWashington\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nAustralia\n\nHungary\n\nCanada\n\nChina*\n\nDenmark\n\nEngland\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nGuatemala\n\nIndonesia\n\nItaly\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMonaco\n\nNorway\n\nRussia\n\nScotland\n\nSingapore\n\nSpain\n\nSwitzerland\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>In July 1995, Houston Ballet became the first full American ballet company invited by the Chinese government to tour the country\n\nHouston Ballet Academy trains over 1,000 students a year and offers training designed to take students from their first introduction to movement through a full course of ballet study. The Academy's faculty includes teachers who have performed with prestigious companies throughout the world.\n\nThe Academy currently offers training in five different programs: Preschool Program, Pre-Professional Program, Professional Program, Houston Ballet II, and the Adult Program. The Preschool Program offers a selection of movement and dance classes for children ages 2–5. The Pre-Professional Program consists of students who are 6 years of age and older. The Professional Program is designed for students who meet the artistic expectations set forth by the Artistic Director Stanton Welch AM and for those students interested in a professional career in ballet. Houston Ballet II is the second company of Houston Ballet. It provides an opportunity for exceptional students to experience a more robust performance schedule that includes company participation, touring, and community performances. The Adult Program provides the community with a series of different classes at varying levels.\n\nThe Academy also hosts a Summer Intensive Program each summer. This 6-week intensive is among the top summer training programs in the world.\n\nRoughly 50% of the professional company has either come through the Academy or participated in the Summer Intensive Program.\n\nHouston Ballet has a long history with community engagement. Under the leadership of Houston Ballet's first director, a scholarship program was established to advance students from the East End into the Academy. From 1988 to 1994, Houston Ballet renewed these efforts by partnering with the Texas Institute for Arts in Education. By 1996, Houston Ballet had created an independent program called \"Talent Search\", which in the ensuing years has evolved into what is now known as \"Chance to Dance\".\n\nIn 1999, Houston Ballet's education programs were formalized into an effort called Education & Outreach, and in 2006 Lauren Anderson was appointed to the newly created position of Outreach Associate. By 2015, the department had been renamed Education & Community Engagement. The department manages 19 different dance education programs serving more than 60,000 participants a year.\n\nHouston Ballet's first performance with a live orchestra was with the Houston Symphony. Together, they performed \"Nutcracker\" in December 1972. Houston Ballet and Houston Symphony would continue to perform together for the next several years.\n\nOne of Stevenson's long-term goals was to create an orchestra that specialized in ballet repertoire. To achieve this goal, in 1983, he hired Glenn Langdon, who had been a rehearsal pianist, as music director. During his leadership, Langdon implemented the concept of a fully auditioned orchestra and increased the size of the string section. Langdon left Houston Ballet in 1989. After his departure, a series of highly regarded guest conductors led the next season. These conductors included John Lanchbery, Jack Everly, Stewart Kershaw, and Terrence Kern. Kershaw, who was music director for Pacific Northwest Ballet, was concurrently named as Houston Ballet's music director, a position he would hold for the next two seasons.\n\nErmanno Florio, who had been a guest conductor during the 1991-92 season, was appointed music director in 1992. Through Florio's direction and leadership, the orchestra rose to its current high level. Part of this progress can be attributed to the collaborative audition procedure that was established with Houston Grand Opera in 2001. The orchestra is currently a member of the Regional Orchestra Players Association and consists primarily of regional musicians. It is a per service orchestra.\n\nThe Houston Ballet Orchestra currently sits at 61 part time professional musicians with 56 core members. Additionally, there are eight full-time professional pianists and several part-time pianists and percussionists who play for classes and rehearsals.\n\nWinifred Wallace, one of the Founding Trustees of Houston Ballet, had a dream: to build a women's auxiliary, or guild, to assist the goals and needs of the Foundation. Her dream came true on January 22, 1973, when the Houston Ballet Guild held its first meeting.\n\nHouston Ballet Guild has grown from its original membership of 22 to more than 380 members with an active board of more than 50 women and men. Over the years, the Guild has expanded its commitment to the company and the Academy and has grown in its importance to Houston Ballet. The Guild provides and array of volunteer services and significant financial support (through Nutcracker Market revenue, membership dues and donations), along with events and programs designed to educate and to generate community interest in dance.\n\nAnnually, over 300 Guild members volunteer more than 2,200 hours for a variety of projects, initiatives, and events.\n\nIn 1981, Houston Ballet Foundation Board member Preston Frazier envisioned a fundraising opportunity that would replicate a European holiday street market. Frazier approached the board of Houston Ballet Guild with this concept as a means to raise much-needed revenue for Houston Ballet, its Academy, and scholarship programs. The first annual Nutcracker Market was met with great anticipation, and former First Lady Barbara Bush was among those in attendance. She would return both in 1986 and 2010 for the ribbon-cutting which opened the Market. Frazier's dream has grown steadily and spectacularly ─ from humble beginnings in a church bazaar setting to a four-day shopping extravaganza at NRG Center.\n\nAnnually, more than 100,000 customers shop to raise over $4.5 million for Houston Ballet, making the Market the single largest source of contributed income for Houston Ballet Foundation.\n\nWith its many projects, initiatives, and direct contributions, as well as proceeds from the annual Nutcracker Market, Houston Ballet Guild has contributed over $86 million to Houston Ballet since its inception.\n\n\nWith 115,00 square feet spread over six floors and containing nine studios, Houston Ballet Center for Dance is the largest building dedicated to a professional dance company in the United States. The first floor of the Center for Dance houses the Margaret Alkek Williams Dance Lab, a black box facility is regularly used for educational performances, lecture series, design meetings, and rehearsals. In addition to all Houston Ballet Administrative Offices, the Center for Dance also boasts an in-house costume shop, shoe room, music library, the Houston Ballet Academy Studios, the Professional Company's Studios and Dressing Rooms as well as a covered walkway that connects the Center for Dance to the backstage of the Wortham Theater Center.\n\nJesse H. Jones II and Anita Stude chaired the capital campaign for Center for Dance. It was a two-pronged campaign that raised money to construct the building as well as increase Houston Ballet's endowment.\n\nExcavation of the building site began in July 2009. On March 10, 2010, Houston Ballet hosted a party with dancers, staff members, donors, and friends to sign the last construction beam. In the end, the new building cost $46.6 million. Staff moved into the building in February 2011, and then-Mayor Annise Parker presided over the ribbon-cutting on April 9.\n\nOn August 26, 2017, Hurricane Harvey hit the city of Houston. Both the Houston Ballet Center for Dance and the Wortham Theater Center took on water, leaving the company and Academy without rehearsal and performance space just as the 2017-18 season was set to open.\n\nNevertheless, the long-anticipated Houston premiere of Sir Kenneth MacMillan’s \"Mayerling\" took place on schedule thanks to The Hobby Center for the Performing Arts, which opened its doors without hesitation.\n\nWhile Hurricane Harvey affected operations at Houston Ballet only temporarily, the damage incurred within its theater home, the Wortham Theater Center, was extensive. The Wortham received 15 feet of water and remained closed for the rest of the season. The Wortham serves as an important storage location for Houston Ballet costumes. Forty years of Houston Ballet history was lost to floodwaters. Wigs, tights, leotards, and specialty items to more than 50 productions were completely destroyed. Among the costumes lost were those for Mark Morris' \"The Letter V\", Aszure Barton's \"Angular Momentum\", and Christopher Bruce's \"Hush\". In order to preserve the 2017-18 season, Houston Ballet launched its \"Hometown Tour\" and presented its planned season at alternate venues, including The Hobby Center for Performing Arts, Smart Financial Centre at Sugar Land, Houston Grand Opera's Resilience Theater at the George R. Brown Convention Center, the General Assembly Hall at the George R. Brown Convention Center, and Jones Hall.\n\nBeing displaced from the Wortham Theater Center is the greatest financial threat Houston Ballet has ever faced, and the total impact will be unknown for the next few years.\n\nIn 2009, the autobiography of former Houston Ballet Principal dancer Li Cunxin - \"Mao’s Last Dancer\" - was made into a film by Australian director Bruce Beresford. It premiered on September 13, 2009, at the Toronto International Film Festival, was nominated for several Australian film awards, and won the AACTA Award for Best Original Music Score.\n\nAfter its premiere in Paris in 2013, \"Sons de L’âme\" was formatted into a documentary film by director Olivier Simonnet. This documentary was presented at the 2014 Houston Cinema Arts Festival.\n"}

Her father was a surveyor who helped rebuild the Tioga Road in Yosemite National Park, starting in 1936. So she had the good fortune of spending her childhood as a self-described \"tomboy\" in Yosemite. A rare crippling disease, dystonia musculorum deformans, kept her to a wheelchair from age 14, but that didn't stop her.\n\nAfter writing \"Wawona's Yesterdays\", she went on to write several other Yosemite History books, focusing on stories about people—making them come alive. Her most authoritative book is \"Galen Clark: Yosemite Guardian\". Shirley self-published most of her books, with printer and historian Hank Johnson, under the name Flying Spur Press, and later under her own imprint Ponderosa Press. Other popular books of hers include \"Pioneers in Petticoats\", \"John Muir in Yosemite National Park\", \"Yosemite & Its Innkeepers\", and \"Yosemite Chapel 1879-1989\".\n\nIn 1961 she bought and built on Theodore Solomons' homesite in Foresta, California, which had only a fireplace surviving from a 1936 fire. She called her home \"Flying Spur,\" but it burned in the 1990 Yosemite A-Rock Fire, which also destroyed her historical papers. She rebuilt her home, but before her death she had to move to her parents' old home in Mariposa, California due to her illness. She died at her home there.\n\n\n"}

His natural faculty for art appears to have been first called into exercise by his admiration for the lord mayor's state coach, which had just been decorated by Giovanni Battista Cipriani. He tried to copy the paintings, and was sent to study under Cipriani. He displayed great skill as a draughtsman, and at the same time acquired without assistance the art of mezzotint.\n\nIn 1765, Earlom was employed by Alderman Boydell, a publisher and promoter of the fine arts, to make a series of drawings from the pictures at Houghton Hall; and these he engraved in mezzotint. His best works are perhaps the fruit and flower pieces after the Dutch artists Van Os and Jan van Huysum. Among his historical and figure subjects are \"Agrippina\", after Benjamin West; \"Love in Bondage\", after Guido Reni; the \"Royal Academy\", the \"Embassy of Hyderbeck to meet Lord Cornwallis\", \"Colonel Mordant's Cock Fight\" and a \"Tiger Hunt\", all after Johan Zoffany, and \"Lord Heathfield\", after Sir Joshua Reynolds.\n\nEarlom was commissioned by John Boydell to copy all 200 drawings of Claude Lorraine's record of his paintings as prints, which were published from 1774 to 1777, when a collected edition in two volumes was published as \"Liber Veritatis. Or, A Collection of Two Hundred Prints, After the Original Designs of Claude le Lorrain, in the Collection of His Grace the Duke of Devonshire, Executed by Richard Earlom, in the Manner and Taste of the Drawings...\" with the inscription on the reverses, a \"descriptive catalogue of each print\" and the current owner, where it was known. A further volume of 100 prints after other Claude drawings from various British collections was added in 1819, also using \"Liber Veritas\" as its title. The title \"Liber Veritatis\" was invented for these reproductions, but is now used for the originals as well. These were then in a rebound book at Devonshire House in London; they are now in the British Museum.\n\nThe prints used etching for Claude's pen lines, and mezzotint for the ink washes, giving a good impression of the originals. All used brown ink on white paper, so disregarding the blue of half the original pages. The prints were a huge success, reprinted and the plates reworked to give increasingly detailed reproductions. They were recommended by drawing teachers as models for copying, and influenced the technique of English watercolour artists in particular, for example Francis Towne.\n\nAttribution:\n"}

During his early 20s he was employed as a clerk in Bombay by the East India Company, returning to England in the early 1830s, where he married and accepted a position with the Bank of England.\n\nThe rapid expansion of the printing industry in Britain during the 1830s prompted Marriott to resign from the Bank of England and use a substantial portion of his wife's inheritance to fund a number of new publications. With the expanding readership of working class in England during the industrial revolution, the investments paid off; Marriott was involved in the creation of the \"Weekly Chronicle\" and popular \"Illustrated London News\".\n\nIn 1845 Marriott began publishing a weekly publication \"Chat\", however by 1849 the venture failed, nearly bankrupting him. This lead ultimately to the dissolution of his marriage.\n\nRumours of gold in the American West prompted Marriott to pursue further adventure overseas; age 45 he sailed to California via the treacherous Isthmus of Panama and was nearly shipwrecked. Avoiding the temptation of the gold fields, Marriott became a banker in San Francisco. In 1856 he used his accumulated wealth to start a publication known as the \"Newsletter\".\n\nHe was described by the publisher of the newspaper \"Northern Indianian\", 19 March 1874 as \"an English gentlemen, of eccentric habits, much shrewdness and enterprise, and entire originality\".\n\nMarriott is credited with inventing the term \"aeroplane\", and intended to build an air transport system that would bring people from New York to California without the perils of the normal voyage of the 19th century. The company he formed (with Andrew Smith Hallidie) in 1866 was named the Aerial Steam Navigation Company.\n\nMarriott was a founder of \"The Illustrated London News\". and credited as the publisher of the \"San Francisco News Letter and California Advertiser\", subtitled \"The Authorized Organ of the Aerial Steam Navigation Company\". One of the lead columns of the \"News Letter\" was named \"Town Crier\", written by Major Ambrose Bierce.\n\nThe \"California China Mail and Flying Dragon\" was a Chinese-language publication and one of the first sources of advertisements encouraging Chinese emigrants to work on the Western railway. It was subtitled \"Issued Every China Steamer Day.\"\n\nThe \"California News Notes\" was illustrated and many of the woodcuts, typically depicting the linkages of various railway lines, remain popular with collectors.\n\nAs a publisher, Marriott was one of the first to print works by Mark Twain and other distinguished writers Bret Harte, Frank Pixley, Ambrose Bierce and Daniel O’Connell.\n\nIn 1841 in London, England, Marriott was one of three board members of the Aerial Transit Company along with John Stringfellow and William Samuel Henson. Marriott was responsible for the illustrations and publicity campaign for their planned aerial steam carriage the \"Ariel\". The aircraft captured the imagination of the public and the company constructed and flew a small glider, but after a failure to build a larger working model and lacking funds, the company failed. Henson married and relocated to the United States, while Stringfellow continued aeronautical experiments. Marriott moved to California during the Gold Rush of 1849.\n\n\"Avitor Hermes Jr.\" was a prototype unmanned aircraft built largely by candlelight in the basement of the publishing building Montgomery Block. The craft flew a few feet off the ground at Shell Mound Park racetrack, Millbrae during a short demonstration on 2 July 1869, Following, \"Avitor\" was moved to the San Francisco Mechanics' Institute Pavilion, the largest hall in the city and displayed with scheduled flights four times per day. Many thousands visited for an admission fee before the aircraft caught fire after its first season.\n\nThe 1869 stock market crash stymied Marriott's efforts to fly a lighter-than-air craft, although he did continue to work on a heavier-than-air triplane all the way until his death. John Joseph Montgomery was inspired by these experiments. Two years before Marriott's death, in 1882, the Aerial Steam Navigation Company was refinanced, and Augustus Laver, architect of The James C. Flood Mansion and The Ellen Kenna House, was named Consulting Engineer of the company.\n\nFrederick Marriott died in San Francisco on 16 December 1884.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1971, WSNJ-AM-FM were sold to Cohanzick Broadcasting, which held the license until the station's move to the Philadelphia suburbs.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the station's frequency and city of license were changed to allow it to move into the more lucrative Philadelphia market. To clear space on the FM band for the new operation, high school station WHHS was moved from 107.9 to 99.9 MHz and a Philadelphia translator of classical station WWFM was taken off the air. During transmitter testing, 107.9 used the call sign WPPZ and broadcast gospel music; owner Radio One eventually gave that call sign and format a permanent home in the market on 103.9 FM.

The last song on \"Hot\" was \"I Like It\" by Sevyn Streeter, while the first song on \"Boom\" was \"99 Problems\" by Jay-Z.\n\nOn September 27, 2016, at Midnight, WPHI and WPPZ swapped formats and call signs with \"Boom\" moving to 103.9 FM, and \"Praise\" moving to 107.9 FM.

The Lalonde brothers self-financed the company's early films, which consisted primarily of a series of documentaries relating to Christian theological issues. Prior to forming Cloud Ten, the LaLonde brothers had found an audience in Christian Evangelical circles through their television program, \"This Week in Bible Prophecy\".\n\nThe company's first feature film was \"Apocalypse (film)\" (1998), a low-budget thriller. The company has since produced three more films in the \"Apocalypse Series\", \"Revelation\" (1999), \"Tribulation\" (2000) and \"Judgment\" (2001).\n\nIn 2000, Cloud Ten Pictures released \"\", based upon the first book in the popular Left Behind book series, authored by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins.

Cloud Ten released \"Left Behind: World at War\" via a coordinated nationwide screening in over 3,200 churches (compared with a typical 1,700 screens in a nationwide theatrical release). The \"World at War\" release started a trend for Christian film church releases, and led Cloud Ten to launching its Church Cinema program.

By October 12, a full recall was announced, affecting all varieties of frozen pot pies sold under the brands Banquet, Albertsons, Cub Foods, Food Lion, Great Value, Hill Country Fare, Kirkwood, Kroger, Meijer, and Western Family Foods. The recalled pot pies included all varieties in 7-oz (200-g) single-serving packages bearing the number P-9 or “Est. 1059” printed on the side of the package. When the pies returned to the market, cooking temperature requirements for serving were made more apparent on the packaging; competitor brands also followed suit.\n\n\n"}

He was nicknamed \"Myggen\" (mosquito) during his career, as he used to flap his arms and hands like one when celebrating his goals.\n\nA rarity in modern Norway footballers (standing at a mere 172 centimeters and a technical player), he played professionally in six different countries, mainly representing IK Start, and earned 78 caps for the Norwegian national team, having appeared in the 1994 and 1998 World Cups as well as Euro 2000.\n\nMykland was one of the most popular footballers in Norway but never without controversy, his bohemian, unshaved look and relaxed lifestyle in contrast to those of the typical footballers.\n\nBorn in Risør, Mykland started his career with modest Bryne FK, being \"brought home\" to IK Start in 1989 for NOK 60.000. He first appeared for the club against Moss FK at Melløs Stadion later that year, helping his team rank ninth in the Tippeligaen.\n\nIn 1990, Mykland was named midfielder of the year in Norway, and also made his international debut – Start finished the 1991 season third, with wins over Viking FK (4–1) and Rosenborg BK (5–0). After the latter, he and seven other teammates were included in the team of the week and, also that year, he was named best player of an under-21 match, as Norway trounced Italy 6–0 in Stavanger; he represented the nation in this category a total of 15 times.\n\nAfter being named the nation's player of the year in 1992, and being relegated with Start four years later, Mykland left for Austria's FC Linz (he had already served a small loan stint at FC Utrecht). Also during that year, producer Thomas Robsahm made a film, simply called \"Myggen\", which consisted in following him for a whole season.\n\nIn 1997, Mykland moved to Panathinaikos FC but, during his spell at the club, it failed to achieve any silverware. After a season in the Bundesliga with TSV 1860 Munich (he also started 2001–02, but was released following a serious run-in with coach Peter Pacult), he joined F.C. Copenhagen in January 2002, playing very little due to injuries while also gaining a dubious reputation off the pitch: newspaper Ekstra Bladet found him three days before a match drunk on a pavement outside nightclub Rust, asking people walking by to arm wrestle him. Håvard Rem wrote a book about the player in 2000, entitled \"Erik Mykland : oppvekst, livsstil, EM 2000, spillestil\".\n\nIn June 2004, Mykland retired at 33 after nearly a year out with injuries. On 8 September 2006, he and several other former Norwegian internationals played an exhibition game against former Argentina stars, including Matías Almeyda, Claudio Caniggia and Diego Maradona, which ended 10–8 for the latter.\n\nIn May 2007, Mykland helped build a football school in his hometown of Risør, alongside former Start player Bernt Christian Birkeland.\n\nOn 9 July 2008, Mykland announced his return to football at the age of 36, rejoining former club IK Start in the second level. On 2 September, he was charged with possession and use of cocaine and having a \"peripheral role\" in a large drug dealing network in Norway's Romerike county.\" In June 2009 he stated that he would withdraw from his active career, after just nine appearances; however, shortly after, he changed his mind, moving to lowly Drammen FK (division three) but retiring for good shortly after.\n\nMykland made his debut for Norway on 7 November 1990, in a 3–1 win in Tunisia. He scored the first of his two goals for his country on 8 September 1992, during a 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifier against San Marino, which finished 10–0.\n\nDuring the 1998 World Cup, in-between games, Mykland and fellow international Henning Berg were caught in a bar drinking. They claimed they had only had a few beers, but Berg later admitted in his biography that they actually were drunk.\n\nIn UEFA Euro 2000, Mateja Kežman of Yugoslavia was sent off after just one minute for a dangerous tackle on Mykland. In all three competitions combined, he appeared in a total of ten matches, nine as a starter – on 23 June 1998, in their historical 2–1 win over Brazil in Marseille, he started on the bench, coming on as a substitute for Roar Strand at half-time.\n\nWhile Mykland failed to score more than twice for the national team, a goal he created by playing through Øyvind Leonhardsen in a Euro 2000 qualifier against Slovenia was rated among Norway's best goals ever – much due to his ability to trick several defenders prior to the pass.\n\nCopenhagen\n\n"}

It is a brilliant love story of two idealistic young radicals, the Chicago-born Janet Rosenberg and Cheddi Jagan, a native of Guyana on South America's northern coast, who fell in love, married and set off for the British colony to start a popular socialist revolution, that led them first to jail and later to the Presidency of the nation. It was featured in numerous film festivals and more widely in February of 2005 on \"Independent Lens\", a series on PBS.\n\nA Jewish girl from Chicago, she grew up to become president of Guyana; a South American nation. Janet Rosenberg Jagan, pegged \"the Second Eva Peron\", in an effort to explain how her typical Jewish upbringing led to her out-of-the-ordinary adult life pursuing service work and Marxist politics in Latin America.\n“I don’t know that people see White when they look at me,” Janet said in an interview, believing that her years in Guyana allowed her to resemble the general population. “I’ve been around for a long time. Fifty-four years is a long time.”\n\n\"Thunder in Guyana\" uncovers an atypical story of a woman who refused to allow her reservations or others' opinions to prevent her from doing what she believed in. Using Janet’s biography, the film brings life to her extraordinary history. Newsreel footage traces the British colony’s slow emancipation and assertion of independence, while discussions with Janet and her followers describe what the courageous female elected official did to organize and educate the country’s impoverished working class.\n\nHer youth was relatively ordinary in many ways, but she was by no means an average youngster. Relatives and relations remember that in her younger years, Janet was remarkably energetic and good-looking, and she was a stand out in all she undertook. Possessing exceptional discipline and goal orientation she successfully trained to become a world class swimmer, who might have competed in the Olympics. But it was also in her nature to be defiant. In the film, Janet laughs recalling how enraged her mother and father were when they learned that, as a teenager, she took flying lessons with the allowance they provided.\n\nRebelliousness was not why Janet journeyed to Guyana; it was love and it kept her in the country for the remainder of her life. While a student at university, a handsome Guyanese exchange student, Cheddi Jagan, caught Janet’s eye. As a team, they ventured into leftist politics, sharing controversial political ideals that excited them and would serve as the bond to their relationship. When Janet traveled with Cheddi back to his native country, her father believed she would return to the United States within one year. He was mistaken; Janet lived the majority of her adult life in Guyana, working with the government and public sector.\n\nIt is the suggestion of the film that Janet’s Jewish background enabled her to connect to the poor laborers of Guyana. Ms. Jagan grew up in an antisemitic, mostly-gentile community that made her feel subjugated and diminished. She recalls that her male relatives struggled to find employment, and that her school friends would tell racially prejudiced stories that they didn’t completely understand. Her efforts for civil rights in Guyana was her personal means of opposing the discrimination she had experienced growing up.\n\nThe film asserts that Janet was viewed by the Guyanese population as a self-sacrificing and relentless force. “She’s been there from the very beginning. She’s put her neck out more than most Guyanese,” Janet's Guyanese daughter-in-law exclaims. “She’s more Guyanese than most Guyanese you’ll meet,” and adds, “she’s more Guyanese than me!”\n\nJanet, of course, was not an object of admiration by all Guyanese citizens. At the beginning of her involvement with Guyanese politics, her opponents spread rumors that she was a family member of the legendary American coupleJulius and Ethel Rosenberg who were put to death for spying and an American journalist implied she was spreading propaganda to enlist communists.\n\nAt eighty-two she still kept an office, happily working for the citizens of Guyana.\n\n"}

Best known for his novels (for which he has won multiple awards), Phillips is often described as a writer, since much of his fictional output is defined by its interest in, and searching exploration of, the experiences of peoples of the African diaspora in England, the Caribbean and the United States. As well as writing, Phillips has worked as an academic at numerous institutions including Amherst College, Barnard College, and Yale University, where he has held the position of Professor of English since 2005.\n\nCaryl Phillips was born in St. Kitts to Malcolm and Lillian Phillips on 13 March 1958. When he was four months old, his family moved to England and settled in Leeds, Yorkshire. In 1976, Phillips won a place at Queen's College, Oxford University, where he read English, graduating in 1979. While at Oxford, he directed numerous plays and spent his summers working as a stagehand at the Edinburgh Festival. On graduating, he moved to Edinburgh, where he lived for a year, on the dole, while writing his first play, \"Strange Fruit\" (1980), which was taken up and produced by the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. Phillips subsequently moved to London, where he wrote two more plays \"Where There is Darkness\" (1982) and \"Shelter\" (1983) that were staged at the Lyric Hammersmith.\n\nAt the age of 22, he visited St. Kitts for the first time since his family had left the island in 1958. The journey provided the inspiration for his first novel, \"The Final Passage\", which was published five years later. After publishing his second book, \"A State of Independence\" (1986), Phillips went on a one-month journey around Europe, which resulted in his 1987 collection of essays \"The European Tribe\". During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Phillips divided his time between England and St. Kitts while working on his novels \"Higher Ground\" (1989) and \"Cambridge\" (1991).\n\nIn 1990, Phillips took up a Visiting Writer post at Amherst College in Amherst, Massachusetts. He remained at Amherst College for a further eight years, becoming the youngest English tenured Professor in the US when he was promoted to that position in 1995. During this time, he wrote what is perhaps his best-known novel, \"Crossing the River\" (1993), which won the Commonwealth Writers' Prize and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. After taking up the position at Amherst, Phillips found himself doing \"a sort of triangular thing\" for a number of years, residing between England, St Kitts, and the U.S.\n\nFinding this way of living both \"incredibly exhausting\" and \"prohibitively expensive\", Phillips ultimately decided to give up his residence in St. Kitts, though he says he still makes regular visits to the island. In 1998, he joined Barnard College, Columbia University, as the Henry R. Luce Professor of Migration and Social Order. In 2005 he moved to Yale University, where he currently works as Professor of English. He was made an elected fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2000, and an elected fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 2011.\n\nPhillips has tackled themes on the African slave trade from many angles, and his writing is concerned with issues of \"origins, belongings and exclusion\", as noted by a reviewer of his 2015 novel \"The Lost Child\". Phillips's work has been recognised by numerous awards, including the Martin Luther King Memorial Prize, a Guggenheim Fellowship, the 1993 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for \"Crossing the River\" and the 2004 Commonwealth Writers' Prize Best Book award for \"A Distant Shore\".\n\nPhillips received the PEN/Beyond Margins Award for \"Dancing in the Dark\" in 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Ski season generally runs from Thanksgiving weekend until the weekend preceding April 15, depending on snow conditions. The area also has cross-country skiing on of Nordic trails.\n\nThe area probably got its name during the 19th-century gold rush. Crooks in the hills above Boise City, known as \"spelterers\", would make bogus gold dust by heating lead filings with a bit of real gold dust.\n\nAlf Engen, the father of the American powder technique, selected the site for the ski area at Bogus Basin in 1939. Bogus opened to the public in December 1942 with a rope tow; a T-bar was installed in 1946. In the early 1950s, Bogus had a 30-meter Nordic ski jump, designed by Corey Engen, and his brother Sverre was Bogus' ski instructor.\n\nThe first chairlift at Bogus was installed in the fall of 1959 at Deer Point and night skiing debuted in December 1964. The resort currently operates 7 chairlifts and 3 Magic Carpets. Three of the chairlifts are high-speed quads (#1 \"Deer Point\", and #6 \"Pine Creek\") were installed in 1996 and 1999, and the newest on #3 \"Superior\" in the fall of 2011.\n\nBogus Basin has of mixed runs, bowls, and glades, with groomed. The lift-served vertical drop is on the east-facing \"back side,\" with a summit elevation of above sea level at the top of Shafer Butte, the highest point of the Boise Ridge mountains. This back side of Shafer Butte was opened in January 1977, following the installation of Pine Creek (#6), a double chairlift, the previous summer. A fixed-grip double for 23 seasons, it became a high-speed quad in the summer of 1999.\n\nOn the front side, Bogus Basin's southern lift-served summit is at \"Doe Point,\" adjacent to Deer Point, which is slightly higher and covered with communications towers at an elevation of . Both vantage points overlook Boise and the entire Treasure Valley, over 4,000 vertical feet (1,220 m) below. Bogus' base area and main day lodge (J. R. Simplot Lodge, formerly \"Bogus Creek\") are at , at the base of the north-facing slopes served by the Deer Point Express (#1), a high speed quad installed in the summer of 1996. The original double chairlift on #1 was installed in 1959 and upgraded in 1981. Showcase (#4), a double chairlift that had replaced a surface poma lift in 1972, is east of and parallel with the Deer Point Express. The original Deer Point lift was relocated and renamed Coach (#7) in 1996, servicing the beginner learning area. It honors Bill \"Coach\" Everts, an early area manager (1953–58) and longtime director.\n\nAt mid-mountain, a second day lodge (\"Pioneer Lodge\" - 1973) sits at with a sizable parking lot, a cluster of condominia (1975), and the Jason Harper Training Center. From this Pioneer area, there is direct access to the gentle south-facing slopes served by a high speed quad chairlift, Morning Star (#2) and the north-facing slopes of the Bitterroot (#5), a double chair lift (vertical: ), which runs only on weekends and holidays. In addition, there is connecting trail access to the base of the Superior Express (#3) lift. With its vertical rise, chair, the Superior Express serves the advanced & expert terrain on the northern face of Shafer Butte, unloading at . The lift replaced a Riblet double chairlift built in 1965 and cut the ride time of the original lift in half. Night skiing was added to the Superior area with the installation of lights in the summer of 1986, and Morning Star was converted from a double to a triple chairlift in 1999.\n\nHistorically, Bogus Basin's average annual snowfall is , but since 2011, the snowfall has been well below average. Due to limited water resources, there is no significant snow making, only small portable units for patching. Night skiing is available on on runs served by five of the chairlifts (none on #5 or #6). Three terrain parks are also available; two on the Deer Point mountain, one for advanced, the other for beginner to intermediate skill levels. The Sunshine Park is located on the Morning Star side of the mountain.\n\nThe main day lodge at Bogus Creek was built in 1962 and expanded in 1991; its ground floor contains the ticket office and ski lockers. In 2002 it was named for agribusiness magnate J. R. Simplot, because without him there might not be a Bogus Basin. When the fledgling ski area was struggling to pay its debts in 1953, Simplot bought its ski lifts and other mountain improvements from the Kingcliffe Co. and leased them back to the Bogus Basin Recreational Association for $1,500 per year for ten years. His intervention averted almost certain financial demise and won the everlasting gratitude of a generation of skiers. Simplot was later the driving force behind Brundage Mountain northwest of McCall, which opened in November 1961.\n\nThe GoldRush Tubing Hill opened in the fall of 2003, constructed just west of the main parking lot for about $100,000. Annual revenues from the hill were expected to be four to five times that figure; revenues for its fourth season (2006–07) were just under $140,000.\n\nThe Glade Runner is a year-round operating mountain coaster that opened in November 2017. The base station was constructed a few yards from the J. R. Simplot Lodge, and the mountain coaster features 4,330 feet (1,320 m) of track.\n\nOther summer activities are available at Bogus, including hiking, mountain biking (no lift service), and a disc golf course. The disc golf course opened in July 2005, centered at the mid-mountain Pioneer Lodge; the upper area of chair 5 \"(Bitterroot)\" hosts the north nine, and the south nine is on the upper area of chair 2 \"(Morning Star)\".\n\nBogus is accessed by Bogus Basin Road (an extension of Harrison Boulevard), which twists from the Boise city limits to the resort, only NNE as the crow flies.\n\nThe two-lane road turns 172 times and gains in elevation as the terrain changes from dry sagebrush foothills to snow-laden mountain forest. Originally a gravel road constructed by CCC crews (funded by the WPA) from 1938–40, Bogus Basin Road was first paved in 1962 and improved in 1998. Before it was paved it was a one-way road, with the direction changed to downhill in the early afternoon.\n\nIn March 1998, Bogus' general manager Mike Shirley reduced the cost of an adult season pass from $500 to $199, lowering the break-even point to just seven visits (and kids' season passes fell to just $29). Bogus Basin sold nearly nine times as many passes for the 1998–99 season versus the previous year, halting the pass sales at 25,000 (2,854 for the 1997–98 season).\n\nThe new pricing strategy generated almost four times as much revenue (nearly $3.6 million) from season pass sales, all before June, six months before the season would begin. Total skier visits went from under 192,000 to over 303,000 (up 58%). Although the sales of day tickets ($31 each) expectedly fell (almost 50%), Bogus' total revenue increased by $2.6 million (up 55%) to $7.3 million for the 1998-99 ski season.\n\nShirley's deep-discount strategy was effective: resorts from coast to coast lowered their prices for multi-day, multi-area, and season passes. Locally, ski equipment sales increased significantly as skiers upgraded their gear.\n\nThe $199 price was in effect for 15 years, until raised to $229 for the 2013–14 season.\n\nSeniors (age 70 and over) skied for free at Bogus through March 2015; the policy was changed that summer. For the 2015–16 season, season passes for seniors were priced at $199 and one-day lift tickets at $44, a discount of ten dollars off the regular daily rate.\n\nMembers of the U.S. Ski Team from Bogus Basin include:\n\nAfter 21 seasons, Mike Shirley announced in February 2012 that he was stepping down as general manager and president. He was succeeded by Alan Moore, the former vice president of finance. Shirley was a former vice president with Morrison-Knudsen Co. and initially hired as an interim manager after the resignation of Terry Lofsvold in November 1991. After the search committee determined he was the best candidate, he was hired in April, the first general manager at Bogus with an extensive background in finance.\n\nMoore stepped down in 2015 and was succeeded in November by Brad Wilson, formerly the general manager at Diamond Peak, Nevada, at northeast Lake Tahoe.\n^ \"\"\n\n"}

It was first published in the United States in 1941 as a selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club (via Time-Life Books), in England in 1942, and in French (as a translation of the English version) in 1947. The book contains many drawings by the author and 32 pages of black-and-white photographs in the first edition. In the United States, where it was most popular, it is considered a classic of travel literature.\n\n\"Kabloona\" recounts Poncin's solo unsupported journey in the Canadian Arctic near King William Island, Canada, where he lived with the Inuit (in those days, still generally called the Eskimos) for about 15 months during the period 1938 to late 1939. Poncins was a French aristocratic count in his late thirties. Bored with the business world, Poncins became a freelance journalist so that he could travel, selling accounts of his experiences to newspapers and magazines.\n\nIn \"Kabloona\", Poncins explores Inuit culture and the Inuit world view, leaving the reader with a deeper understanding of such things as wife-swapping, living in an igloo at , why and how Inuit have feasts lasting 20 hours at a stretch, their concepts of time and family life, their perspectives on Europeans and European food and gear, the Inuit diet, hunting techniques, wildlife, nomadic life, dogs, weather, clothing, communal sharing of goods, and notions of private property.\n\nPoncins was not a scientist and did not study the Inuit from a scientific perspective. Rather, he provides his own stylized personal points of view and descriptions of Inuit life. In the book, he is initially disparaging of the Inuit way of life, seeing it as primitive and often using the description \"cave man\". Indeed, a clear theme of racial superiority, described in terms of innate intelligence and physical appearances, and cultural superiority in terms of morals and ethics pervades the first part of his work. As the book progresses and his hardships in the harsh Arctic environment take their toll (at one point Poncins runs behind a dog sled), he begins to find a new appreciation for the Inuit way of life, for their intelligence and resourcefulness, and experiences a spiritual awakening, ultimately reaching a point where he discovers that he himself has become so well adapted to the Inuit way of life that he is no longer a \"kabloona\" and has become one of them.\n\nThe title \"Kabloona\" is a transcription of the Inuktitut word nowadays spelled \"qallunaaq\" (\"qablunaaq\" in Inuinnaqtun). It is a term originally used to describe white Europeans - a reference to their \"qalluit\", the bushy eyebrows that the Inuit saw as the distinctive feature of Europeans. Nowadays, its use is a bit vaguer. It can mean Anglo-Canadian in contrast to other ethnolinguistic groups like the \"uiviimiut\" - French Canadians. Alternately, it is used to describe non-Inuit Canadian society, or even occidental society as a whole. In the 1940s, however, Inuit made fewer of those distinctions, and the term could easily apply to Poncins despite his French ethnicity.\n\nIn the 1941 film \"Never Give A Sucker An Even Break\", waitress Jody Gilbert calls W.C. Fields a \"big kabloona\". Fields replies: \"Kabloona -- I haven't been called that for two days.\" \n\nThe Firesign Theater recording \"In The Next World You're On Your Own\", Side 2 is labeled \"We've Lost Our Big Kabloona\"\n\n"}

Pietrasanta is part of Versilia, on the last foothills of the Apuan Alps, about north of Pisa. The town is located off the coast, where the \"frazione\" of Marina di Pietrasanta is located. \nIt lies on the main road and rail link from Pisa to Genova, just north of Viareggio.\n\nThe town has Roman origins and part of the Roman wall still exists.\n\nThe medieval town was founded in 1255 upon the pre-existing \"Rocca di Sala\" fortress of the Lombards by Luca Guiscardo da Pietrasanta, from whom it got its name. Pietrasanta was at its height a part of the Republic of Genoa (1316–1328). The town is first mentioned in 1331 in records of Genoa, when it became a part of the Lucca along with the river port of Motrone, and was held until 1430. At that time it passed back to Genoa until 1484, when it was annexed to the Medici held seigniory of Florence.\n\nIn 1494, Charles VIII of France took control of the town. It remained a Luccan town again until Pope Leo X, a member of the Medici family, gave Pietrasanta back to his family.\n\nThe town suffered a long period of decline during the 17th and 18th centuries, partially due to malaria. In 1841, Grand Duke Leopold II of Tuscany promoted several reconstruction projects (including the building of schools specially created to teach carving skills, and the reopening of the once famous quarries).\n\nThe town then became the capital of the \"Capitanato di Pietrasanta\", which included the towns of Forte dei Marmi, Seravezza and Stazzema (this region became the historical heart of Versilia). The town joined the newly unified Italian Kingdom in 1861.\n\n\nThe area, like most of Tuscany in general, has long enjoyed the patronage of artists. Pietrasanta grew to importance during the 15th century, mainly due to its connection with marble.

{"id": "2321527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321527", "title": "Sangharaj Nikaya", "text": "Sangharaj Nikaya\n\nThe Sangharaja Nikaya is a tradition of Theravada Buddhism, located in Bangladesh. \n\nThe word Nikaya is Pali and literally means \"volume\". It refers to the sections of the Tipitaka. However, an alternate usage is practiced in Southeast Asia, in which the word \"Nikaya\" is a respectful term for a monastic community.\n\nThe community consists largely of rural Bengali Buddhists. It was formed in 1864 by Sangharaja Saramedha Mahasthavira.\n\nFrom the 13th to the middle of the 19th century, Bengali Buddhism underwent its own \"Dark age\". In this time, much cross-over between Hinduism and Buddhism occurred, such that Hindu deities such as Shiva, Lakshmi, and Durga were worshipped by Buddhists, as \"Buddhist\" deities. This went so far as to include animal sacrifice, at the time an acceptable practice in Hinduism.\n\nMoreover, the rules of the Vinaya began to be re-interpreted and the canonical text itself more or less fell by the wayside. Monks were commonly involved in leading a household life, having families, and even serving as \"matchmakers\". It was under these conditions that the Sangharaj of Myanmar, Saramitra Mahasthabir, inaugurated his reform movement in the 19th century.\n\nSaramitra Mahasthabir arrived at the Chittagong province of Bangladesh in 1856 after being invited by Radha Charan Mahasthabir, an important Bengali monk. While in Bangladesh, the Sangharaj travelled between towns in order to see for himself the state of Bengali affairs. He remained in Bangladesh for a few months before returning to Myanmar.\n\nNine years later, in 1864, the Sangharaj returned to Chittagong at the invitation of Bengali monks. Arriving with an entourage of his own students, the Sangharaj began his reform movement within the Sangha. He chastised monks for following practices that the Vinaya clearly outlaws, such as animal sacrifice, using of money, maintaining a family, drinking alcohol, and eating food (especially meat) not offered. He also attacked the practice of ordaining monks below the age of 20 - full ordination is only available to those over the age of twenty. Likewise, he attacked the laxity in the order which allowed those who clearly were not suited to the religious life to remain. \n\nAfter his efforts to reform the Sangha, the Sangharaj turned his attention toward lay practice and spoke against animal sacrifice and the worship of gods. \n\nSaramitra Mahasthabir became highly influential and persuaded a growing number of monks to be re-ordained as a gesture of their adherence to the reform movement. \n\nThis movement to re-ordain under the auspices of a \"Buddhist Reformation\" marked the beginning of what has now become the Sangharaj Nikaya. Saramitra Mahasthabir performed upasampada for a group of seven monks at Pahartali-Mahamuni, and this initial group of eight began to rapidly expand. \n\nWith a new nikaya under his authority, the Sangharaj became highly effective at eliminating the worship of gods and the practice of tantra.\n\nAn anti-reformation movement came into being in order to counter-act that which was led by Saramitra Mahasthabir. This movement became known as the Mahasthabir Nikaya and was led by none other than Radha Charan Mahasthabir, the Bengali monk who first invited Saramitra Mahasthabir to Bangladesh. \n\nIt's important to note, however, that the Mahasthabir did not oppose the Sangharaj on doctrinal grounds - they did not advocate the practices the Sangharaj Nikaya attempted to eradicate. In point of fact, they are doctrinally \"identical\" to the Sangharaj Nikaya. However, the Mahasthabir Nikaya believed that a Bengali Buddhist order should not come under a powerful influence from a foreign entity. They opposed the Sangharaj Nikaya on the grounds that the Sangharaj Nikaya was foreign in origin, not on the grounds that the Sangharaj Nikaya was degenerate. Differences between the lineages are purely practical, i.e., they advocate different day-to-day practices for their monks. As such, differences are extremely minimal, and important only to the monastic sangha. Laity following the different traditions did not particularly differentiate between the two. The distinction served only to maintain an organizational front, not a doctrinal opposition.\n\n"}

She was long and at her beam and she had a gross register tonnage of . She could accommodate 1,128 passengers and was operated by a crew of 120. She covered the distance from Aomori to Hakodate in 4 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nAs early as 1950, she was fitted with radar equipment, becoming one of the first Japanese sea liners to be so equipped. She was used by the Emperor the month before she sank. She was also famous as the flagship of the Tsugaru Strait.\n\nTyphoon Marie, which had previously blown through Honshū, was in the Sea of Japan at 12:00 on September 26, 1954, heading northeast with wind speeds of more than 100 km/h. It was predicted to reach the Tsugaru Strait at around 17:00.\n\nAt 11:00, \"Tōya Maru\" arrived at Hakodate after its first journey that day from Aomori. She was originally scheduled to return at 14:40, to arrive at Aomori just before Typhoon Marie. However, due to the expected storm, another ferry— \"Dai 11 Seikan Maru\", a somewhat poorer quality vessel—could not depart on her scheduled journey to Hakodate. Therefore, passengers and vehicles were transferred to \"Tōya Maru\", delaying her departure.\n\nThe captain of \"Tōya Maru\" decided to cancel its journey at 15:10.\n\nAt 17:00, following heavy rainfall in Hakodate, the weather cleared up and the outlook improved. The captain, presuming that the typhoon had now passed as predicted, decided to proceed with the journey to Aomori. However, by this time the typhoon had only slowed down and was predicted to remain over the strait for an entire day.\n\nAtypically, the typhoon gained strength in the Sea of Japan. It was considered to have already become an extratropical cyclone when it reached Japan.\n\nAt 18:39, \"Tōya Maru\" departed from Hakodate with approximately 1,300 passengers aboard. Shortly thereafter, the wind picked up coming from a SSE direction.\n\nAt 19:01, \"Tōya Maru\" lowered its anchor near Hakodate Port to wait for the weather to clear up again. However, due to high winds, the anchor did not hold and \"Toya Maru\" was cast adrift. Water entered the engine room due to the poor design of the vehicle decks, causing its steam engine to stop and \"Tōya Maru\" to become uncontrollable. The captain decided to beach the sea liner onto Nanae Beach, on the outskirts of Hakodate.\n\nAt 22:26, \"Tōya Maru\" beached and an SOS call was made. However, the waves were so strong that the sea liner could no longer remain upright and at around 22:43, \"Tōya Maru\" capsized and sank at sea several hundred meters off the shore of Hakodate. Of the 1,309 on board, only 150 people survived, while 1,159 (1,041 passengers, 73 crew and 41 others) died.\n\nAmong those killed were 35 American soldiers from the U.S. Army's 1st Cavalry Division Artillery who were traveling from Hokkaidō as an advance party to set up a new camp (Camp Younghans) at Higashine, Yamagata, near Sendai. One soldier survived when he was swept through a port hole. Another, 2nd Lt. George A. Vaillancourt, Battery C, 99th Field Artillery Battalion, 1st Cavalry Division, was posthumously awarded the Soldier's Medal, the highest non-combat medal at the time, for his courage during the tragedy. The football field at Camp Younghans was dedicated to Lt. Vaillancourt on September 24, 1955.\n\nFour other ferries sank in the same typhoon, making a total loss of life of 1,430.\n\nThe sinking of \"Tōya Maru\" was one of the major factors behind the construction of the Seikan Tunnel between Hokkaidō and Honshū. However, ferry traffic still continues to operate in the strait.\n\n\n"}

Eventually, the horses were tested for speed and strength in festivals of the late Meiji Era (1900).\n\nThe popularity grew; in 1953, Hokkaido's four cities (Kitami, Asahikawa, Iwamizawa, and Obihiro) began to manage races. The former three closed operations in 2007 due to declining revenues. Obihiro racecourse is now the only one currently active, hosting races most Saturdays, Sundays, and Mondays. Races are also held on more days to mark special occasions, such as New Year's Day, and there are many regional races known as \"ban'ei koshien\".\n\nThe Obihiro racecourse nearly closed in 2006 before Softbank, a Japanese mobile phone company, provided funds for the races to continue. \"Odds Park Cup\" race, named after the internet-betting subsidiary of Softbank, was established in 2007 as an expression of gratitude. Other companies, such as Rakuten and Sapporo Breweries have added their sponsorship and several support schemes have been initiated, including a race-sponsoring scheme for individuals.\n\nThe \"ban'ei\" course consists of a dirt track with lanes separated by ropes laid in the sand. This creates ten lanes, each incorporating a starting gate and two hill-shaped obstacles. The second and steeper obstacle is called the Ban'ei Point. Horses haul sleds across this track, with the weight of each sled ranging from to 1 ton, as seen in the Ban'ei Kinen event.\n\nJockeys stand and balance on the sled, using long reins as a whip and weight slabs under the feet of the jockey in place of a saddle. Each jockey must weigh at least ; if the jockey is underweight, slabs are added to meet the smallest weight. Horses are often deliberately stopped after the first obstacle, and given a chance to rest before being ushered to climb the second. A horse has not finished until the entire sled is behind finish line. \n\nAfter the race completes, racehorses are freed from the sleds and led to the back yard, while the sleds are returned to the starting gate with the aid of a trolley. The amount of weight a horse must pull is determined by several factors, with younger horses and mares pulling less than older horses and stallions. A horse's group and rating—which further determines the required weight—depends upon the amount of money the horse has previously earned. Horses compete in groups labeled 1–26, and groups are rated with Open, A1, A2, B1, B2, B3, B4, C1, C2 or D (in order of decreasing winnings). This is like system used in Japanese thoroughbred racing. The weight allowance of jockeys is either , based on the number of wins.\n\nBecause \"ban'ei\" racing is about strength and not speed, the winning time of major races is often slower than lower-class races, where even a small overtime can have a horse disqualified. With suitable ground conditions, horses pulling lightly loaded sleds can clock speeds under 50 seconds. The condition of the track is described using measured-moisture percentage. The track is repaired manually during or between races. Watering is used to prevent excess dust from irritating horses and people. Heating systems allow racing during the winter months.\n\nHorses in \"ban'ei\" are often either purebred or crossbred variations of Belgian, Breton, or Percheron draft horses. Their weight can surpass one ton, twice the weight of a thoroughbred. \n\nPotential stock is chosen from draft horses raised for meat.\nMost \"ban'ei\" horses start official racing as two-year-olds after passing inspection held between April and August. Regional races (\"ban'ei koshien\") with finals for yearlings are held in October. Horses that do not pass inspection are either sent back to a breeder as they can be used in events or tourism, or to feedlot.\n\nCompeting horses are mainly solid-coloured, but there have also been pinto \"ban'ei\" horses and two dominant whites.\n\nFormer racehorses not eligible for breeding are usually sold for meat. At the close of every fiscal year during the end of March, prolific retiring racehorses are honoured at their own ceremony. The National Association of Racing (NAR) annually awards the best horse.\n\nThe Japanese draft horse is a breed with open studbook created by crossing purebred and half bred horses together for five consecutive generations. Horses that don't meet this requirement have been registered since 2003 as half-blood draft horses.\n\nEight draft breeds have been listed as eligible for the breeding program: Ardennes, Clydesdale, Shire, Brabançon, Breton, Boulonnais, Belgian and Percheron. This is not directly comparable to breeding stock available. , purebred stallions in stud are Bretons and Percherons, while data about new registrations of broodmares from 2014 indicates that from purebreds, three form most: Bretons, Percherons, and Belgians.\nJapanese drafts are used mainly in \"ban'ei\" and horse meat production. The ideal horse has draft phenotype and \"hybrid vigour\".\n\nThe breed doesn't have any colour or marking specifications. Colours of bay, chestnut, flaxen chestnut, black, gray and variety of roans have been recorded since they also exist in purebreds. In extreme cases, a horse may have multiple facial markings and all legs marked with white. Open studbook policy has led to pinto (piebald) pattern; one female family used in \"ban'ei\" can be traced to single stallion born in 1967, while dominant white seen in two horses was spontaneous, manifesting in 2010. Prevalence of hereditary diseases is unknown, since at least one Western scientific source lists breed as \"ban-ei\" without hereditary diseases.\n\n"}

As a result, \"Casa Presidencial\" in El Salvador refers to several separate locations. One is the president's current official residence which is located on Avenida Masferrer (approx three blocks north of the Masferrer \"redondel\" or traffic circle) in the upper portion of Colonia Escalon (AKA Lomas Verdes). The second \"Casa Presidencial\" is the old president's offices in San Jacinto. The San Jacinto location has been abandoned since the January/February 2001 twin earthquakes. The third \"Casa Presidencial\" is the current location of the president's offices, No. 5500 Manuel Enrique Araujo Highway (known as Calle a Santa Tecla), Colonia San Benito, San Salvador, which had been a country club with small golf course and then the Ministry of Foreign Relations.\n\nConstruction work on the original official residence began place in 1911, the year in which the President of the republic, Dr. Manuel Enrique Araujo, made a decree which would authorize the acquisition of a property called “Quinta Natalia”. That property was situated in the San Jacinto neighborhood, to the south of the capital city. On May 9, 1912, the Legislative Assembly allowed the hiring of a national, North American, or European firm for the construction of several buildings, including one destined to be \"The Normal School for Teachers\" which would later become the presidential house.\n\nThis area had evidence of human occupation since Pre-Columbian times, because of the numerous archeological items found there. Next to the property the famous “Modelo” hacienda lay, where the National Zoo is now located. After the death of President Araujo, Carlos Meléndez succeeded him. President Meléndez modified the original plan for the \"Normal School for Teachers\" and decided to make it \"The Normal School for Boys\". On September 21, 1913 he set the first stone on the “Quinta Natalia” property for construction.\n\nThis building is largely the work of Luis Fleury, whose design combines the elegant Classic and Art Nouveau styles. Its completion was delayed several years because of a series of circumstances, among them the damage suffered from the 1917 and 1919 earthquakes, and the delays caused by the First World War. It was finished in 1921, but not until 1924 did it start to function officially as the Formal School for Boys.\n\nIn 1931, after the overthrowing of President Arturo Araujo, General Maximiliano Hernández Martínez took over the presidency. He briefly took up official residence in the “El Zapote” barracks. Because of the political, economic, and social difficulties the country was going through at the time and because of security issues of the executive and his family, President Martinez decided to move the offices of the presidential house to the building that occupied the Normal School for Boys in the San Jacinto neighbourhood, close to the “El Zapote” barracks.\n\nThe period between the 1950s and 1960s was of great economic growth, because of the raising prices of coffee internationally. Some call this time the “golden age of El Salvador”; this abundance was demonstrated in the splendor and fame that receptions and parties the Presidencial house showed.\nThe old government house is surrounded by four beautiful parks, named after people of national and international importance. These people are: Juan José Cañas, Salvadoran composer and author of the lyrics of the National Anthem; Felipe Soto, famous national composer; Venustiano Carranza, politician of Mexico and president of that country from 1917 to 1920; and Miguel de Cervantes, one of the Best writers Spain has seen, known worldwide as the creator of Don Quixote.\n\nEvery president who governed from this mansion has tried to give it a personal touch, such as remodeling the building, changing the carpets or the wallpaper, or acquiring an art object to add to the collection. Some adornments and elements of the current rooms belonged to the former presidential houses. Among these are the Victorian era mirrors that adorn the Hall of Honor. Also, the collection of paintings that decorate the main halls were painted between 1957 and 1959 by the Chilean artist Luis Vergara Ahumada, with the historical guidance of Professor Jorge Lardé y Larín. They were painted during the administration of Lieutenant Colonel José María Lemus. The remodeling works completed during the administration of Dr. Armando Calderón Sol, were coordinated by the private secretary of the presidency, Ángel Benjamín Cestoni and supervised by the interior designer María Eugenia Perla. Earthquakes in January and February 2001 severely damaged the location and President Franciso Flores authorized the relocation of Casa Presidencial offices to their current location in San Benito.

Each dorsal scale contains two apical pits (Price 1990a, 1990b). The dorsum is uniform olive or reddish brown without dark markings on a cream-colored background (Ottley and Jacobsen 1983). Yellowish or greenish coloration extends from the lower sides of the body to the venter (Price 1990b). The iris is yellow-green (Ottley and Jacobsen 1983).\n\nDowling and Price (1988) have placed this snake in its own genus \"(Bogertophis)\" based on immunological data, but complications with the data set and the mode of analysis indicate that it is best to regard this species as a member of the rat snake genus, \"Elaphe\", until further data become available (L. Grismer and John Wright, pers. comm.). No attempts have been made to characterize genetic variation across the geographic range of \"E. rosaliae\". An understanding of that variation is needed to determine whether genetically differentiated populations exist within \"E. rosaliae\". The difficulty in obtaining the requisite material for such a study makes it likely that novel techniques, such as extracting DNA from preserved specimens, will be needed to address this problem.\n\nThe Baja California rat snake ranges from extreme southern Imperial County southward into Baja California to Cabo San Lucas (Price 1990a). Over at least the northern half of its range, it is known from widely disjunctive locations (Ottley and Jacobsen 1983, Price 1990b). Its known elevations range from near sea level to ca. 300 m. In the United States, \"E. rosaliae\" is known from only one road-killed specimen CSDSNH 644161 taken 26 May 1984 on Interstate Highway 8, east of Mountain Spring (Imperial County), California. Although Stebbins (1985) and others believe this locality to be genuine (L. Grismer and G. Pregill, pers. comm.), some have questioned the validity of this record (S. Barry, J. Copp, and C. Fagan, pers. comm.).\n\nThe life history of \"E. rosaliae\" is virtually unknown (Price 1990b). The species seems to be nocturnal or crepuscular and may be surface active during daylight hours under suitable conditions (Ottley and Jacobsen 1983). Nothing is known about reproduction or growth except that clutches with an unspecified number of eggs have been laid in captivity (Price 1990b). The few data on diet and behavior are based on captive specimens and are difficult to interpret in the absence of data on this snake under field conditions. If similar to other rat snakes, it climbs easily (Wright and Wright 1957) and adults are probably long-lived (see Bowler 1977). No data on movement, colonization abilities, or the potential predators of this taxon exist.\n\n\"Elaphe rosaliae\" is largely confined to mesic and dry desert habitats (rocky - arroyos and washes) in the immediate vicinity of small springs (Ottley and Jacobsen 1983, Stebbins 1985) but individuals have also been observed on hillsides and dry mesas away from water sources (L. Grismer, pers. comm.). The habitat components critical to this snake have not been identified precisely, but it may require some kind of shrub or tree with a moderately dense crown in which to take refuge because it has been taken in native fan palms (\"Washingtonia\" spp.), date palms (\"Phoenix dactylifera\"), mesquite, palo blanco (\"Lysiloma candidum\"), palo verde, and creosote bush associations in the past (Price 1990b). The locations of oviposition sites are unknown.\n\nThe California State Government classes its status as \"Special Concern\". It notes that the snake is an infrequently observed species avidly sought after by amateur, scientific, and professional collectors alike. Because of the uncertain status of the single record from California, it believes that it should remain protected until further information regarding its distribution within the state becomes available.\n\nThe California Department of Fish and Game Habitat Conservation Planning Branch recommends that intensive surveys of habitats with shrubs or trees having a moderately significant crown in Imperial and San Diego counties are needed to determine whether this snake is really part of the herpetofauna of California.

{"id": "2321562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321562", "title": "Center (gridiron football)", "text": "Center (gridiron football)\n\nCenter (C) is a position in gridiron football. The center is the innermost lineman of the offensive line on a football team's offense. The center is also the player who passes (or \"snaps\") the ball between his legs to the quarterback at the start of each play.\n\nIn recent years, the importance of centers for a football team has increased, due to the re-emergence of 3–4 defenses. According to Baltimore Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome, \"you need to have somebody who can neutralize that nose tackle. If you don't, everything can get screwed up. Your running game won't be effective and you'll also have somebody in your quarterback's face on every play.\"\n\nThe center's first role is to pass the football to the quarterback. This exchange is called a snap. Most offensive schemes make adjustments based on how the defensive line and linebackers align themselves in relation to the offensive line, and what gaps they line up in. Because the center has an ideal view of the defensive formation before the snap, he typically makes the first line call. This call is typically based on the position of the defensive linemen or linebackers in his gaps (0i-1i), most subsequent adjustments are dependent on this call. In some cases, the center may call an adjustment for the entire offensive line. This was taken to an extreme by the Indianapolis Colts in the early 21st century, with center Jeff Saturday having equal say with quarterback Peyton Manning in play calling, including audibles. The center is therefore usually the most intelligent player on the offensive line, which is critical to a center's success.\n\nAfter the snap, the center performs blocking assignments. The blocking assignments vary by offense but typically consist of the following:\n\nRun blocking assignments will vary based on the current play and the defensive formation when the ball is snapped. Typically, these assignments consist of the following:\n\n\nOn most plays, the center will snap the ball directly into the quarterback's hands. In a shotgun formation, the center snaps the ball to the quarterback lined up several yards behind him. In punt and field goal formations, the center also snaps the ball several yards behind him to the punter or holder on the field goal unit. Because bad snaps can ruin special teams plays and cause turnovers, most teams have a center who is specifically trained for snapping the ball in punt and field goal formations. This player is referred to as the team's long snapper. Also, the center does not have to snap the ball to the quarterback, holder, or punter. He is allowed to snap the ball to anyone behind him. Because of this, some plays involve snaps directly to running backs instead of the player generally expected to receive the snap, hoping to fool the defense.\n\nIn slang, the player receiving the snap is said to be \"under center\" if he receives the ball directly from the center (not in shotgun). This phrase is typically applied to quarterbacks but has been used in reference to other positions as well.\n\nOn all special teams formations, the center is a long snapper. Today, all NFL teams have a dedicated long snapper.\n\nAlthough the quarterback commands the ball, it is the center's snap that renders the ball in play; the defensive line may not cross the line of scrimmage until the center snaps the football. An astute center can help draw an opposing team offside prior to the snap or potentially trick the other team into a penalty by quickly snapping the ball while the opposing team attempts to substitute players.\n\nUnder college and high school rules, the center, as a long snapper, may not be contacted until 1 second after the snap has been initiated. This will result in \"roughing the center.\"\n\nAdditionally, a snap must be a continuous motion. If a center halts the snap motion, this draws the penalty of \"illegal snap.\"\n\nIn college football, the Dave Rimington Trophy is awarded annually to the nation's most outstanding center.\n"}

He played college football for the USC Trojans football team. He retired from playing in 2004 and is now in broadcasting.\n\nPeete was born in Mesa, Arizona. He attended Sahuaro High School in Tucson for three years before switching to Shawnee Mission South High School in Overland Park, Kansas, for his senior year. He was a three-year letterman in football, basketball, and baseball. In football, he was named the Arizona High School Player of the Year as a junior. Peete was drafted in the 30th round (722nd overall) by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 1984 Major League Baseball draft. He did not sign and elected to attend college at the University of Southern California. He is the son of Willie Peete, former running backs coach of the Kansas City Chiefs and the Chicago Bears. His brother is NFL coach Skip Peete.\n\nPeete was the first player ever from USC to win the Johnny Unitas Award as the nation's best senior quarterback (since earned by Carson Palmer and Matt Leinart as well). In that senior year, he also finished second to Barry Sanders in the voting for the Heisman Trophy. His USC teams would win both head-to-head matchups in the UCLA–USC rivalry against Troy Aikman's UCLA teams. The 1988 UCLA-USC game was notable in that Peete was stricken with measles the week before the game and had been hospitalized. He led USC to the 1988 and 1989 Rose Bowl games.\n\nPeete was also a star third baseman on USC's baseball team. He was named to the all-Pac-10 team. He was drafted three different times while at USC. In the 1988 MLB draft by the Oakland Athletics in the 14th round (359th overall), the 1989 MLB draft by the Athletics again in the 13th round (348th overall) and the 1990 MLB draft by the Detroit Tigers in the 28th round (742nd overall).\n\nPeete did not achieve stardom in his professional career in the NFL, but played well enough to sustain his place in the league for 16 seasons, primarily as a backup. Selected by the Detroit Lions as the 141st pick in the 6th round of the 1989 NFL Draft, Peete was scheduled to start the season opener but sprained his knee in an exhibition game against the Los Angeles Rams, missing the first few games of the season. He would have been the first rookie quarterback to start for the Lions since 1968, when Greg Landry started.\n\nHis career was marked by injury. In his first five NFL seasons with the Lions, he would split time with Bob Gagliano, Erik Kramer, and former Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware. After spending time with the Dallas Cowboys, Washington Redskins, Philadelphia Eagles, and Oakland Raiders, Peete's career appeared to be over until he became the starter for the Carolina Panthers in 2002, where he led the Panthers to start the year 3–0 and ultimately to a 7–9 record, an improvement over 1–15 the year before.\n\nAfter a weak showing in the first half of 2003 season opening game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, head coach John Fox replaced him in the third quarter with Jake Delhomme, who then led the Panthers to a comeback victory. Delhomme subsequently replaced Peete as the Panthers' starting quarterback, leading the team to an 11–5 record that ultimately led to Super Bowl XXXVIII against the New England Patriots.\n\nThe Panthers released Peete to free agency in February 2005 for salary cap reasons, but he chose to retire instead of re-signing with a team for another season. Peete finished his career with the most NFL career passing yards among QBs from USC, a record that was eventually eclipsed by Carson Palmer.\n\nAfter his retirement from the NFL, Peete became one of the hosts of the Fox Sports Networks sports talk show \"The Best Damn Sports Show Period\" alongside John Salley, Chris Rose and Rob Dibble. In 2015, the Oprah Winfrey Network announced that they were making a docuseries on Peete and his family.\n\nRodney Peete and his wife Holly Robinson Peete star in Lipozene commercials on television.\n\nIn 2019, Rodney Peete co-hosted the Hallmark Kitten Bowl.\n\nPeete has been married to actress Holly Robinson Peete since 1995. They have four children: twins, daughter Ryan Elizabeth Peete and son Rodney Peete, Jr. (born October 19, 1997), son Robinson James Peete, (born August 11, 2002), and son Roman Peete (born February 25, 2005).\n\nOne of their twins, Rodney Jr., was diagnosed with autism at age three. He tells of his story of Rodney, Jr., in the June 2010 issues of \"Men's Health\".\n\nIn November 2013, Peete was named as a 2014 recipient of the NCAA Silver Anniversary Award, given annually to six former college athletes 25 years after the end of their college athletics careers.\n\nPeete is the son-in-law of late actor Matt Robinson, and cousin of the late professional golfer Calvin Peete.\n\n"}

It was available as a coupé and in later models as a convertible. Toyota stopped selling the car in the United States in 1997, however the car continued to be sold in Canada, Europe and Japan until 1999. The Paseo, like the Tercel, shares a platform with the Starlet. Several parts are interchangeable between the three.\n\nThe name \"Paseo\" is Spanish for \"a walk\" or \"a stroll\", while the name \"Cynos\" is a coined word taken from \"cynosure\", meaning \"the target of attention\".\n\nThe first-generation Paseo was made from 1991 to 1995. Based on the L40 series Tercel, it is powered by a 1.5-liter \"5E-FE\" inline-four engine. In most markets, the Paseo's engine was rated at at 6,400 rpm and of torque at 3,200 rpm. In 1993, in California and other states with California level emissions standards, it was rated at and of torque. It was offered with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission.\n\nIn Japan, the Cynos was available in α (Alpha) and β (Beta) trim levels. The α trim is powered by a \"5E-FE\" engine producing , while the β trim is powered by a \"5E-FHE\" engine producing . In β trim, four-wheel disc brakes and TEMS electronically controlled suspension can be selected as options.\n\nThe second-generation Paseo was introduced in Japan in 1995, and for the 1996 model year in North America. Apart from some modernizing in the engine electronics, the only noticeable change was in the body sheet metal. A convertible model was shown at the October 1995 Tokyo Motor Show and was released for sale in August 1996. This was the last year the Paseo was sold in the United States (1997 model year).\n\nTo reduce emissions levels, the second-generation Paseo's \"5E-FE\" engine performance was reduced to the same specifications as the California CARB models, delivering and of torque.\n\nThe second-generation Paseo was sold in the United Kingdom from 1996 to 1998, but was withdrawn due to slow sales. The UK market Paseo was offered in three trim levels: the base ST, the Si; adding 14-inch alloy wheels, a Sony CD player, color-coded boot spoiler with third brake light and an anti-lock braking system, and the Galliano, adding a color-coded chin spoiler, mud guards and yellow paintwork with aquamarine decals on the bodysides, as well as wider 15-inch alloy wheels with low-profile 195/50 tires. The convertible model was not offered. All UK models came with the \"5E-FE\" engine producing . The top speed, as claimed by Toyota, was .\n\nThe Japanese market version was again named \"Cynos\". Three trim levels were available: α, α Juno Package and β. All came with color-coded wing mirrors and a rear windscreen wiper. The models differed in their dashboards, interior upholstery, steering wheels and engines. The Juno trim came with a 1.3 L \"4E-FE\" engine with a 4-speed automatic transmission. The α trim had the 1.5 L \"5E-FE\" engine with a 5-speed manual transmission and the β trim came with a \"5E-FHE\" engine, also with a 5-speed manual transmission.\n\nBoth the Paseo and Cynos were discontinued in 1999.\n"}

It is important in the analysis of systems of bodies in mechanical engineering, structural engineering, aerospace engineering, robotics, and other fields.\n\nThe position of a single railcar (engine) moving along a track has one degree of freedom because the position of the car is defined by the distance along the track. A train of rigid cars connected by hinges to an engine still has only one degree of freedom because the positions of the cars behind the engine are constrained by the shape of the track.\n\nAn automobile with highly stiff suspension can be considered to be a rigid body traveling on a plane (a flat, two-dimensional space). This body has three independent degrees of freedom consisting of two components of translation and one angle of rotation. Skidding or drifting is a good example of an automobile's three independent degrees of freedom.\n\nThe position and orientation of a rigid body in space is defined by three components of translation and three components of rotation, which means that it has six degrees of freedom.\n\nThe exact constraint mechanical design method manages the degrees of freedom to neither underconstrain nor overconstrain a device.\n\nThe position of an \"n\"-dimensional rigid body is defined by the rigid transformation, [\"T\"] = [\"A\", \"d\"], where \"d\" is an \"n\"-dimensional translation and \"A\" is an \"n\" × \"n\" rotation matrix, which has \"n\" translational degrees of freedom and \"n\"(\"n\" − 1)/2 rotational degrees of freedom. The number of rotational degrees of freedom comes from the dimension of the rotation group SO(n).\n\nA non-rigid or deformable body may be thought of as a collection of many minute particles (infinite number of DOFs), this is often approximated by a finite DOF system. When motion involving large displacements is the main objective of study (e.g. for analyzing the motion of satellites), a deformable body may be approximated as a rigid body (or even a particle) in order to simplify the analysis.\n\nThe degree of freedom of a system can be viewed as the minimum number of coordinates required to specify a configuration. Applying this definition, we have:\n\nThe motion of a ship at sea has the six degrees of freedom of a rigid body, and is described as:\nSee also Euler angles\n\nThe trajectory of an airplane in flight has three degrees of freedom and its attitude along the trajectory has three degrees of freedom, for a total of six degrees of freedom.\n\nThe mobility formula counts the number of parameters that define the configuration of a set of rigid bodies that are constrained by joints connecting these bodies.\n\nConsider a system of \"n\" rigid bodies moving in space has 6\"n\" degrees of freedom measured relative to a fixed frame. In order to count the degrees of freedom of this system, include the fixed body in the count of bodies, so that mobility is independent of the choice of the body that forms the fixed frame. Then the degree-of-freedom of the unconstrained system of \"N\" = \"n\" + 1 is \nbecause the fixed body has zero degrees of freedom relative to itself.\n\nJoints that connect bodies in this system remove degrees of freedom and reduce mobility. Specifically, hinges and sliders each impose five constraints and therefore remove five degrees of freedom. It is convenient to define the number of constraints \"c\" that a joint imposes in terms of the joint's freedom \"f\", where \"c\" = 6 − \"f\". In the case of a hinge or slider, which are one degree of freedom joints, have \"f\" = 1 and therefore \"c\" = 6 − 1 = 5.\n\nThe result is that the mobility of a system formed from \"n\" moving links and \"j\" joints each with freedom \"f\", \"i\" = 1, ..., j, is given by\n\nRecall that \"N\" includes the fixed link.\n\nThere are two important special cases: (i) a simple open chain, and (ii) a simple closed chain. \nA single open chain consists of \"n\" moving links connected end to end by \"n\" joints, with one end connected to a ground link. Thus, in this case \"N\" = \"j\" + 1 and the mobility of the chain is\nFor a simple closed chain, \"n\" moving links are connected end-to-end by \"n\" + 1 joints such that the two ends are connected to the ground link forming a loop. In this case, we have \"N\" = \"j\" and the mobility of the chain is\n\nAn example of a simple open chain is a serial robot manipulator. These robotic systems are constructed from a series of links connected by six one degree-of-freedom revolute or prismatic joints, so the system has six degrees of freedom.\n\nAn example of a simple closed chain is the RSSR spatial four-bar linkage. The sum of the freedom of these joints is eight, so the mobility of the linkage is two, where one of the degrees of freedom is the rotation of the coupler around the line joining the two S joints.\n\nIt is common practice to design the linkage system so that the movement of all of the bodies are constrained to lie on parallel planes, to form what is known as a \"planar linkage\". It is also possible to construct the linkage system so that all of the bodies move on concentric spheres, forming a \"spherical linkage\". In both cases, the degrees of freedom of the links in each system is now three rather than six, and the constraints imposed by joints are now \"c\" = 3 − \"f\".\n\nIn this case, the mobility formula is given by\nand the special cases become\nAn example of a planar simple closed chain is the planar four-bar linkage, which is a four-bar loop with four one degree-of-freedom joints and therefore has mobility \"M\" = 1.\n\nA system with several bodies would have a combined DOF that is the sum of the DOFs of the bodies, less the internal constraints they may have on relative motion. A mechanism or linkage containing a number of connected rigid bodies may have more than the degrees of freedom for a single rigid body. Here the term \"degrees of freedom\" is used to describe the number of parameters needed to specify the spatial pose of a linkage.\n\nA specific type of linkage is the open kinematic chain, where a set of rigid links are connected at joints; a joint may provide one DOF (hinge/sliding), or two (cylindrical). Such chains occur commonly in robotics, biomechanics, and for satellites and other space structures. A human arm is considered to have seven DOFs. A shoulder gives pitch, yaw, and roll, an elbow allows for pitch, and a wrist allows for pitch, yaw and roll. Only 3 of those movements would be necessary to move the hand to any point in space, but people would lack the ability to grasp things from different angles or directions. A robot (or object) that has mechanisms to control all 6 physical DOF is said to be holonomic. An object with fewer controllable DOFs than total DOFs is said to be non-holonomic, and an object with more controllable DOFs than total DOFs (such as the human arm) is said to be redundant. Although keep in mind that it is not redundant in the human arm because the two DOFs; wrist and shoulder, that represent the same movement; roll, supply each other since they can't do a full 360.\nThe degree of freedom are like different movements that can be made.\n\nIn mobile robotics, a car-like robot can reach any position and orientation in 2-D space, so it needs 3 DOFs to describe its pose, but at any point, you can move it only by a forward motion and a steering angle. So it has two control DOFs and three representational DOFs; i.e. it is non-holonomic. A fixed-wing aircraft, with 3–4 control DOFs (forward motion, roll, pitch, and to a limited extent, yaw) in a 3-D space, is also non-holonomic, as it cannot move directly up/down or left/right.\n\nA summary of formulas and methods for computing the degrees-of-freedom in mechanical systems has been given by Pennestri, Cavacece, and Vita.\n\nIn electrical engineering \"degrees of freedom\" is often used to describe the number of directions in which a phased array antenna can form either beams or nulls. It is equal to one less than the number of elements contained in the array, as one element is used as a reference against which either constructive or destructive interference may be applied using each of the remaining antenna elements. Radar practice and communication link practice, with beam steering being more prevalent for radar applications and null steering being more prevalent for interference suppression in communication links.\n\n"}

San Martín was allegedly part of the lodge, and he took the Maitland Plan as a blueprint for the movements necessary to defeat the Spanish army in South America; he carried on successfully with the last five points of the plan, and thus liberated a great part of the continent.\n\n"}

It is used for general aviation and sees one airline, subsidized by the Essential Air Service program.\n\n100 people are employed at the airport. The only airline is United Express operated by SkyWest Airlines, with 19 weekly Canadair Regional Jets to Chicago. Barkley Regional Airport is the 5th busiest airport in Kentucky.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021 categorized it as a non-hub primary commercial service facility.\nFederal Aviation Administration records say this airport had 21,654 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 18,542 in 2009 and 19,903 in 2010.\n\nBarkley Regional Airport is named after former Vice President of the United States Alben W. Barkley, who was from western Kentucky. The airport was previously served by Northwest Airlink (operated by Mesaba Airlines) Saab 340 regional turboprops with service to Memphis International Airport. When Northwest Airlines merged with Delta Air Lines, service to Memphis from Paducah was discontinued. New airline service began when Chicago-based United Airlines started daily Canadair CRJ200 regional jets nonstop to Chicago O'Hare International Airport with this service being operated by SkyWest Airlines flying as United Express on behalf of United. Service began in the winter of 2010.\n\nOriginally built as a military airfield in 1941, thanks to the efforts of then Senator Alben Barkley, the airfield was originally used to facilitate U.S. Army Air Corps B-17 bomber crew training which was taking place at nearby Dyersburg, TN. In 1945 the U.S. government deeded the land to the city of Paducah and McCracken County, making it available for civilian use. \n\nOn April 1, 1946 a Chicago and Southern Air Lines (C&S Air Lines) Douglas DC-3 was the first airline flight out of Paducah and the airport has had scheduled airline flights ever since. Chicago and Southern was then acquired by Delta Air Lines which in turn continued to serve Paducah. Ozark Airlines arrived in 1951. According to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), two airlines were serving Paducah in 1976: Delta with McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jets nonstop from Evansville and Memphis as well as direct, no change of plane DC-9-30 jet flights from Atlanta, Birmingham, AL, Boston, Chicago O'Hare Airport, Indianapolis and Philadelphia, and Ozark with nonstop McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jet and/or Fairchild FH-227B turboprop flights from Clarksville, TN, Louisville, Nashville and St. Louis as well as direct, no change of plane DC-9-30 jet flights from Chicago O'Hare Airport, Columbia, MO, Indianapolis, Kansas City and Milwaukee. Delta left in 1979 and Ozark pulled out in 1980.\n\nSeveral commuter and regional air carriers operating turboprop aircraft served Paducah during the 1980s. In 1981 Air Illinois was operating nonstop service from Cape Girardeau, MO, Carbondale, IL, Memphis and St. Louis with larger Hawker Siddeley HS 748 regional aircraft as well as with smaller de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and Handley Page Jetstream commuter aircraft while Allegheny Commuter was flying on behalf of USAir nonstop from Louisville with Beechcraft commuter aircraft. In 1985 Allegheny Commuter had expanded its service on behalf of USAir with nonstops from Evansville, Louisville, Nashville, and Owensboro, KY with Beechcraft 99s while Britt Airways was flying nonstop from Cape Girardeau, Evansville, Memphis and St. Louis with Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner propjets. By 1989 three airlines were serving the airport: American Eagle operating on behalf of American Airlines with nonstop service from Nashville flown with Fairchild Swearingen Metros, Northwest Airlink flying on behalf of Northwest Airlines nonstop from Evansville and Memphis with British Aerospace BAe Jetstream 31 and Saab 340 aircraft, and Trans World Express operated by Air Midwest on behalf of Trans World Airlines (TWA) nonstop from Evansville and St. Louis flown with Fairchild Swearingen Metroliners and Saab 340 aircraft.\n\nBarkley Regional Airport covers 1,018 acres (412 ha) at an elevation of 410 feet (125 m).

Idiomatic expressions, particularly profanity, are not always directly translatable into other languages, and so most of the English translations offered in this article are very rough and most likely do not reflect the full meaning of the expression they intend to translate.\n\nAs in most languages swear words tend to come from semantic domains considered taboo such as the domains of human excretions, sexuality, and religion. As in most languages, in Spanish swearing serves several functions in discourse.\n\nSpanish insults are often of a sexual nature, taking the form of implying a lack of sexual decency if the insulted person is a woman (e.g. \"puta\", \"whore\", \"zorra\" \"bitch\") or implying a lack of masculinity if the insulted person is male (e.g. \"maricón\" \"faggot\", \"puto\" \"male prostitute\"). A particularly forceful Spanish insult is any mention of someone else's mother, including also in its strongest form (e.g. \"¡me cago en tu puta madre!\" \"fuck your whore of a mother!\", in which \"me cago\" out of context means “I shit\", but in this sentence it expresses disregard).\n\nEmphatic exclamations, not aimed to insult but to express strong emotion, often include words for sexual relations (e.g. \"¡joder!\" \"fuck!\", \"¡chingados!\" \"fuckers!\") or to excretions or sexual organs (\"¡mierda!\" \"shit!\", \"¡coño!\" \"pussy!\"). Sexual taboo words that describe a masculine sexuality may be used in a positive sense (e.g. \"cabrón\" \"male goat\", \"gallo\" \"rooster\", \"cerdo\" \"pig\").\n\nThe following words are indicative of a variety of sexual acts, especially sexual intercourse and masturbation, though mostly limited to specific geographic regions.\n\nchingar—originating from the Basque verb txingartu, meaning \"to burn with coal\" or from Caló (Spanish Romani) word čingarár, meaning \"to fight\". In the work \"La Chingada\", it was famously applied to La Malinche, the mistress of Hernán Cortés.\n\nThe word is derived from \"chingar\" which means \"to fuck\", which came from the Romani language word for \"fight\" used by the Gitanos. This word has many meanings in the Spanish language, most limited to Mexico:\n\n\nThese words are often used in the following contexts:\n\n\nLike , the word comes from . When used to describe a person, it describes someone who likes to fight, or a troublemaker (i.e. one who causes trouble, especially one who does so deliberately).\n\nfollar—used particularly in Spain and to a lesser extent in Cuba, but rarely found elsewhere. Follar literally means \"to blow air with the bellows\" and probably refers to panting during sex.\n\nThe verb \"joder/joderse\" is a harsh way of saying \"to bother\" and its English equivalent is \"fuck\". It can literally mean \"to fuck somebody\" e.g. \"anoche, Juan y su novia jodieron\" (\"last night Juan and his girlfriend fucked\"), or it can mean \"to annoy\", \"to ruin\", etc. \"no me jodas\" (don't annoy/bother me), or \"lo has jodido\" (you've fucked it up). It can be used as an adjective, like the English \"fucking\" (\"jodido\") and is often used as a light interjection: \"¡Joder! Olvidé mi abrigo\" (\"Fuck! I've forgotten my coat\").\n\nAlternative ways of referring to sexual intercourse include: \"follar, echar un polvo\" (Spain), \"coger\" (Argentina, Mexico), \"chimar, pisar\" (Central America), \"culear\" (Chile and Colombia) and \"cachar\" (Peru).\n\nRemojar el cochayuyo (lit.: to soak the \"cochayuyo\")—used in Chile The expression alludes to the cochayuyo algae that is harvested on Chile's coast. The algae is preserved by sun-drying. To be used for cooking, it then needs to be softened by soaking in water.\n\nCojón (plural cojones) is slang for \"testicle\" and may be used as a synonym for \"guts\" or what it takes\", hence making it equivalent to English balls or bollocks.\n\nA common expression in Spain is anything to the effect of \"hace lo que le sale de los cojones\" (\"does whatever comes out of his/her balls\"), meaning \"does whatever the fuck he/she wants\". Variations are \"sale de los huevos\", \"sale de las pelotas\", etc. A common Basque catchphrase is \"los de Bilbao nacemos donde nos sale de los cojones\" (\"we Bilbao natives are born wherever the fuck we want\").\n\nSometimes, to denote obnoxious or overbearing behavior from someone else, idiom \"tocar los cojones/huevos/pelotas/ ...\" (\"to touch someone else's balls\") comes to play. For instance: \"Venga, dame eso y para ya de tocarme los cojones\" (\"Come on, give me that and stop bothering me.\") It can sometimes be an understatement: \"A principios de los treinta, los nazis ya empezaban a tocar los cojones\" (meaning, roughly, \"At the beginning of the 1930s, the Nazis were already being an annoyance.\").\n\nIt is also frequent to derive other words, such as adjectival form cojonudo (lit.: \"ballsy\"), indicating admiration. A famous Navarran brand of asparagus has this name.\n\nCojones also denotes courageous behavior or character. Acts of courage or bravery are expressed by using the word \"cojones\". For example, \"Hay que tener cojones para hacer eso\" (\"it takes cojones to do that\").\n\nIt is sometimes used, at least in Spain, as a suffix, complement or termination to a word or name in order to confer it a derisive or overbearing quality. For instance: \"el Marcos de los cojones\" (\"That fucking guy Marcos\"), \"¡Dame ya la maleta de los cojones!\" (\"Give me the fucking suitcase why don't you!\") However, it is more common to use \"de cojones\" as a superlative, as in \"Es bajo de cojones\" (\"He's short as hell\" or \"He's short as fuck\").\n\nThe phrases \"me importa un cojón\" or \"me importa un huevo\" mean \"I don't give a fuck about\" In alternative variations one would raise the number, usually to three: \"me importa tres cojones\".\n\n\"Cojones\" alone can also be used much like the four-word exclamations, though less usually; it is frequently a giveaway for native Catalan speakers when they speak Spanish, as collons is used much more profusely in situations akin to those for \"fuck\" or \"shit\".\n\n\"Tocarse los cojones/los huevos/las pelotas/las peras\" (lit. \"to touch one's own balls\") stands for idleness or laziness. The fact that this is not a well-known expression in the United States may have been the excuse, according to some sources, for the April 2011 dismissal of a Princeton Spanish senior lecturer, with tragic consequences. In Chile, this term is unused; the preferred expression is \"rascarse las huevas\" (lit. \"to scratch one's own balls\").\n\nCarajo (lit.: \"crow's nest\") is used in Spain in reference to the penis. In Latin America (except Chile), it is a commonly used generic interjection similar to \"fuck!\" \"shit!\" or \"damn it!\" in English. For example: \"Nos vamos a morir, ¡carajo!\" (\"We're gonna die, fuck!\") or a far away place, likened to hell: \"¡Vete al carajo!\".\n\nIn Argentina, the term \"Vamos Carajo\" was used in Quilmes advertising in advance of the 2014 FIFA World Cup as a statement or cheer that an Argentine supporter would use to urge their team to victory.\n\nThe diminutive carajito is used in the Dominican Republic and Venezuela to refer to (usually annoying) children, or to scold someone for acting immaturely, e.g., \"No actúes como un carajito\" (\"Don't act like a little dick!\").\n\nCaray is a mild minced oath for this word. \"Ay caray\" could be translated \"Dang it\" or \"Darn it!\" The word caracho is also considered mild like \"caray\".\n\nThe connotation of \"far away place\" is supposedly based on the name of the Cargados Carajos, which belong to Mauritius. Nationalistic chants commonly use the phrase: \"¡Viva Cuba, carajo!\", \"¡Viva el Ecuador, carajo!\", and \"¡Viva el Perú, carajo!\"\n\nIt is said that the term \"carajo\" originated during the Moorish invasion in Spain. The Moors were described as \"\"—or \"garlic-face\"/\"garlic-shaped face\"—which was later contracted to \"carajo\". In some other parts, cipote can also be used.\n\nBicho (lit.: \"bug\", \"baitworm\") is one of the most commonly used references to the penis in Puerto Rico. It is similar to the much less commonly used word pinga. In most other regions it is a non-vulgar reference to an insect or several species of small animals.\n\nIn Venezuela, it can be used as an interjection. In El Salvador, it is commonly used as the slang equivalent of \"kids\". In Nicaragua, and some parts of Costa Rica, \"bicho\" is used to reference the vagina. In Spain and the Dominican Republic, Mexico and many other Spanish speaking countries it refers to people (both male and female) who are a negative influence on others, often used as \"mal bicho\" (\"bad bug\"). When applied to children, it can mean one who is misbehaving.\n\nHuevos (literally: \"eggs\"), pelotas (literally: \"balls\"), bolas (literally: \"balls\"), peras (literally: \"pears\"), and albóndigas (literally: meatballs) all refer to testicles in a profane manner. They are equivalent to \"cojones\" in many situations. In Mexico, the word is not used in a potentially ambiguous situation; instead, one may use the inoffensive \"blanquillos\" (literally: \"little white ones\").\n\nSometimes the words lavahuevos (\"egg-washer\") or lamehuevos (\"egg-licker\") are used in the same context as \"brown-noser\" (meaning ambitious and self-effacing) in English.\n\nHighly offensive Dominican insults involving this term are mamagüevo/mamagüevos (\"egg-sucker\") and mamagüevazo (\"huge egg-sucker\"). \"Mamagüevo\" is also used in Venezuela where it is considered less offensive.\n\nHuevada/Huevá (lit.: \"covered in egg\") is used in Chile, Ecuador, and Peru in reference to objects (\"¡Qué huevá más grande!\" may translate to \"What an annoyance!\"). Shortened forms huevá or even weá and wa are usually intended to be less offensive. Many expressions using \"cojones\" in other countries are used in Chile with \"huevas\" replacing the former word. There's also a local expression: \"¿Me hai visto las weas?\" (lit. \"Have you taken a look at my testicles?\") means \"How much of a fool do you think I am?\".\n\nÑema (a corruption of \"yema\", meaning \"yolk\") refers to the glans. The word mamañema is functionally similar to \"mamagüevo\".\n\nPelotas can have another meaning when it comes to nudity. \"Andar en pelotas\" means to walk about stark naked.\n\n\nIn Mexico, \"huevón\" is a pejorative term that usually translates as \"slacker\". In Mexico, Panama and El Salvador it can be loosely translated as \"couch potato.\" One may also say tengo hueva, meaning \"I'm feeling lazy.\" In the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, güevón/güebón is the preferred form. In Venezuela, it is pronounced more like \"güevón\" and, often, ueón. In Chile and Peru, the preferred form to use is \"huevón\" (often shortened to \"hueón\" or \"weón\") and \"ahuevonado\"/\"aweonao\". In Panama, awebao is the popular form, and a good example of the clipping of consonants (and sometimes vowels) in informal Spanish. In Argentina boludo can be used by young people as a culturally appropriated term of endearment (¿cómo andás, boludo? = how do you do, pal?), but it can also mean \"slacker\", \"idiot\", etc. In Chile, Peru and in the Quito region of Ecuador Ni cagando, huevón is a phrase commonly used among youth meaning \"Don't even think about it\" or \"Absolutely not\". In Mexico, Tenga huevos translates as \"Have some balls\". For example, one can hear a Mexican say \"No corras, ten huevos\" which means \"Don't run away, have some balls\".\n\nVerga (lit.: a \"yardarm\"—a part of a ship's mast that holds the sails) occurs in a number of Romance languages, including Portuguese and Italian.\n\nIn Venezuela it can be used as a vulgar generic filler, as well as a boastful self-reference (similar to the English \"That shit\" or \"I'm the shit\"). For example, \"¡Soy bien verga!\" (lit.: \"I'm very dick!\") means \"I'm very good at it!\", and \"¡Soy la verga andando!\" (lit.: \"I'm the walking dick!\") means \"I'm the best that there is!\". However, in the Venezuelan state of Zulia, the word is commonly used instead of \"vaina\"\n\nIn Mexico it refers to the penis; \"Te voy a meter la verga\" means \"I'm going to insert my penis in you\"; referring to somebody else, \"Le metió la verga\" or \"se la metió\" means \"he fucked her\" or \"he fucked him\" which may be the literal meaning, or more likely, it means that in a business, he got away with what he wanted for little money. It also have another meanings and derivative terms, for example: \"Soy la verga\" (\"I am the best one\"); \"Me fué de la verga\" (roughly \"something bad happened to me\"); \"Me vale verga\" (\"I dont care\"); \"Vergueé\" (\"I ruined it\", \"I failed\"); \"Me verguearon\" (\"They defeated me\"); \"Me pusieron una verguiza\" (\"They scolded me\", \"They beat me\"); \"Vergón\" (\"cocky\", \"cool\", \"sexy\"); \"Está de la verga\" (\"That's ugly/bad\" but also \"That's very cool\", \"That's awesome\") etc. \n\nA common expression in Mexico is \"¡Vete a la verga!\", meaning \"Get the fuck out of here!\" In Mexico can be used as difficult or impossible: \"¡Está de la verga!\", \"This is very difficult!\"\n\nIn Guatemala, it also refers to a state of drunkenness as in \"¡Está bien a verga!\", meaning \"He's drunk as Hell!\" or \"He's shit-faced!\". In El Salvador it can also be used with an ironically positive connotation as in \"¡Se ve bien vergón!\" or \"¡Está bien vergón!\", which means \"It looks great!\"\n\nIn Honduras, the expression \"no vale ni verga\" is used as a vulgar form of \"no vale la pena\", meaning \"it's not worth it\".\n\nIn Nicaragua, the expression \"¡A la verga!\" means \"Screw it!\" which is used in Honduras also.\n\nIn the United States, the variant \"a la verga\" or \"a la vé\" for short, is very common in northern New Mexico, and is used frequently as an exclamatory expletive.\n\nChile is famous for its amount of alternate names and euphemisms for the penis. These range from the inoffensive (\"pito\" (lit. \"whistle\"), \"diuca\" (after a small bird)), through vulgar (\"pichula\", \"pico\") and euphemistic (\"cabeza de bombero\" (lit. \"firefighter's head\"), \"dedo sin uña\" (\"nail-less finger\")) to markedly euphemistic and humorous (\"taladro de carne\" (lit. \"meat drill\"), \"cíclope llorón\" (lit. \"crying cyclops\"), \"chacal de las zorras\" (lit. \"cunt jackal\", in the sense of the jackal being a relentless predator), et cetera).\n\nSomething similar happens in Argentina. From the classic \"pito\" or \"pirulín\" (a cone-shaped lollipop), which are innocent and even used by children, you can go all the way to the most vulgar ways as \"pija\", \"verga\" (lit. \"yardarm\"), \"choto/chota\" (after \"chotar\" which means \"to suck\"), \"porongo/poronga\" (a \"gourd\", which is also used to craft \"mates\"), \"banana\", \"salchicha/chorizo\" (two kind of sausages), \"pedazo\" (lit. \"piece\"), \"garcha\" (also used as the verb \"garchar\", which means \"to fuck\"), \"palanca de cambios\" (gear stick), \"joystick\", \"bombilla de cuero\" (lit. \"leathery bombilla\". \"Bombillas\" are used for drinking mate by sucking into them), etc. Among young people, almost every word can be turned into mean \"dick\": -\"¿Me pasás el encendedor?\" -\"¡Acá tengo un encendedor para vos!\" (-\"Can you give me the lighter?\" -\"I have a lighter for you right here!\").\n\nConcha (lit.: \"mollusk shell\" or \"inner ear\") is an offensive word for a woman's vulva or vagina (i.e. something akin to English cunt) in Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Mexico. In the rest of Latin America and Spain however, the word is only used with its literal meaning. In such regions, it is commonly heard in the phrase ¡(La) concha (de) tu madre! (\"The \"cunt\" of your mother\"), which may be used as an expression of surprise or grief, or as a highly disrespectful insult. The contracted term conchatumadre/conchetumadre is common and extremely offensive in Chile, Bolivia and Peru as well.\n\nIn Mexico \"concha\", which is used in its literal meaning, is also a type of sweet bread, round conch-shaped and covered in sugar, as well as having the aforementioned meaning and is offensive when used in said context. In Spain, Puerto Rico, Cuba and Mexico, \"Concha\" is a common name for females (corruption of \"Concepción\"). Also in Puerto Rico there is a popular hotel called La Concha Resort (The Seashell). Key West, Florida also has a famous hotel named La Concha. Concha can also mean a seashell-a conch.\n\nChucha/¡Chuchamadre! and ¡Chucha de tu madre! are Panamanian, Chilean, Ecuadorian, Peruvian or southern Colombian equivalents. Random examples and expressions: \"Vení, oleme la chucha\" (\"Come and sniff my pussy\"), \"¡Ándate a la chucha!\" (roughly \"Fuck off\").\n\nChocha (or \"chocho\") employed term for \"pussy\" predominantly in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Colombia, Spain, Mexico, Venezuela, and Dominican Republic. In the Spanish province of Albacete is also used choto (var. \"chotera\", \"chotaco\") in the same sense. The word is a homonym as it is also synonymous with \"senile\" when used as \"He/she is chocho/chocha\". In Chile, the word is used to mean \"happy\", and is used for old people; for example, the sentence \"La abuelita quedó chocha con el regalo que le dí\" means \"Granny was happy with the gift I gave her\". \n\nIn Venezuela, \"chocha\" is also a type of round seed or a particular type of bird.\n\nThe name of the Latin American restaurant Chimi-Changa originated as a minced oath of \"chocha.\"\n\nCoño (from the Latin \"cunnus\") is a vulgar word for a woman's vulva or vagina. It is frequently translated as \"cunt\" but is considered less offensive (it is much more common to hear the word \"coño\" on Spanish television than the word \"cunt\" on British television, for example).\n\nIn Puerto Rico, Spain, Venezuela, Mexico, Cuba, Dominican Republic and Panama it is amongst the most popular of curse words. The word is frequently used as an interjection, expressing surprise, anger or frustration. It is also common to use the expression \"¿Pero qué coño?\" to mean \"What the fuck?\"\n\nIts usage was so common among Spaniards and Spanish-Filipino mestizos living in the Philippines that konyo became a Tagalog word for upper-class people.\n\nIn Ecuador and Chile it means stingy, tight-fisted, although in the latter country the variation \"coñete\" is becoming more common.\n\nIn Mexico and the Philippines, panocha (or panoche) refers generally to sweet breads or cakes, or, more specifically, to a raw, coarse form of sugar produced there. It is also a fudge made with brown sugar, butter, cream or milk, and nuts (penuche). In New Mexico it means a sprouted-wheat pudding. In the southwestern United States outside of Northern New Mexico (and in northern Mexico and some places in Cuba), however, it often refers to the female genitalia. Use of this word has been known to cause embarrassment among Hispanos of New Mexico when speaking with Mexicans from Mexico.\n\nThe word is a combination of penuche and panoja meaning \"ear of corn\", from the Latin \"panicula\" (from whence comes the English word \"panicle\"—pyramidal, loosely branched flower cluster).\n\nCuca (short for \"cucaracha\", lit.: \"cockroach\") is used in Honduras, Guatemala, Venezuela, southeastern México and Colombia. Slightly milder than \"coño\", and is almost inoffensive in the Dominican Republic.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic it is a common term for a parrot.\n\nIn Chile it is criminal slang for paddy wagon. In general, it is used to refer to something considered scary.\n\nIt is also an inoffensive word for penis that many children use in Spain. It also has a slightly archaic use in Spain.\n\nIn Latin America it may describe a congenial, outgoing person with a gift for flattery (\"Julia is very cuca\") or (\"Eddie is so cuco; look at all the friends he has.\").\n\nIn Nicaragua and in the Canary Islands, it is used as slang for \"penis.\"\n\nIt is often the diminutive of the name María del Refugio.\n\nIn Cuba, it is also used as a term for a charley horse.\n\nAlthough less used as profanity, some words for the bust can also be used derogatorily or humorously. Among them, some noteworthy are peras (i.e. pears), perolas (i.e. pearls), mingas, tatas, tetas, tetamen, or pechamen, che-ches or chi-chis.\n\nCulo is the most commonly used Spanish word for \"ass.\" In El Salvador and Honduras, culero (\"one who uses the \"culo\"\") refers to a male homosexual, while in Mexico it refers to an unjust, unkind, aggressive or insensitive person likened to the connotation provided by the word asshole but usually more offensive.\n\"Vete a tomar por el culo\" (\"Go and take it in the ass\") is an expression used in Spain, it is like \"Vete a la mierda\" but more offensive.\n\nIn Chile and Peru, culo is considered offensive (as it sounds very much like culear); poto is used instead.\n\nIn Argentina culo or culito are almost innocent words, though they can also be considered vulgar depending on the context. Expressions like \"en el culo del mundo\" (lit. \"in the ass of the world\"), \"en la loma del culo\" (lit. \"In the ass hill\"), which mean \"too far away\" or \"cara de culo\" (lit. \"ass face\", used to describe an unpleasant face expression) are regularly used.\n\nIn Panama culo is used in to construct slang terms and phrases which range from slightly inappropriate to offensive but commonly used regardless. \"Cara de culo\" (ass face) refers to an unattractive person especially when the person in question has a round face with protruding cheeks. \"Culo del mundo\" (\"asshole of the world\") and \"casa del culo\" (\"ass house\") mean far away e.g. Vivo por \"casa del culo\"/en el \"culo del mundo\" lit. I live by ass house/in the asshole of the world. \"Culear\" means to have sexual intercourse—the same as fuck in its literal meaning— but does not imply anal sex. \n\n\"Culito\" (\"little ass\") is used by younger men to refer to women in a sexual context; it is also used to refer to the buttocks in an inappropriate but affectionate way. \"Culo de botella\" (\"bottle ass\") refers to thick eyeglasses. \"¡Ponte placa en el culo!\" (\"put a license plate on your ass!\") is a phrase yelled by motorists at pedestrians who are standing or walking in the middle of the road, particularly in heavy traffic. \"Recular\" means to go on reverse while \"estacionarse/parquearse de recula\" means to reverse park. \"Culillo\" means fear while \"culilloso/a\" refers to someone who gets scared easily. \"Hablar hasta por el culo\" (\"To talk out of the ass\")—a local, impolite variant of the well-known frase \"Hablar hasta por los codos\" (\"to talk through the elbows\")—refers to someone who talks a lot; this variant is used to refer to a person in a negative way (as in \"He/she won't shut up\") while \"Hablar hasta por los codos\" does not necessarily imply annoyance.\n\nFundillo/Fundío—heard in Mexico and the southwestern United States as an obscene term specifically for the human anus. It carries about the same weight as the American usages of the words \"(someone's) asshole\" or \"the crack of (someone's) ass.\" \"Fundío\" refers literally to the anus and is not used as a personal insult. For example, \"¡Métetelo en fundío!\" (or in Mexico, \"Métetelo por el fundillo\") is an expression of reproach. (\"Shove it up your ass!\") The variant \"fondillo\" is also found in Puerto Rico and Cuba. In the Dominican Republic, the milder term fullín and the very offensive cieso may also be used.\n\nOjete (lit.: \"eyelet\")—refers to the anus in some countries, and also is used to mean \"asshole\": \"Se portó para el ojete conmigo\" (\"He was a really bad person with me\", or \"He was an asshole to me\"). A popular obscene graffito in Mexico among schoolchildren is OGT; when the letters are pronounced in Spanish, they sound like \"ojete\". In Argentina and Uruguay, \"ojete\" and also its synonyms culo and orto can all be used to mean \"good luck\": \"¡Qué ojete tiene ese tipo!\" (He's such a lucky guy!), \"Ganó de puro ojete!\" (He won just because he was so terribly lucky).\n\nOrto (a euphemism for \"recto\", that is rectum, from Latin \"ortus\", as both rectum and orto are Latin words that mean \"straight\". Although due to its lower class origin it is also believed (and more likely) to be the vesre form of \"roto\", which means \"broken\", for \"culo roto\".)—in Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, refers to buttocks (as either an object of appreciation or disgust): \"Qué tremendo orto tiene esa mina\" (in praise of a woman's buttocks), \"Qué cara de orto\" (\"What an ugly/bitter/moody face\"); or luck—either good or bad. \"Me fue para el orto\" and \"Me fue como el orto.\" mean \"I had an awfully bad luck on that\". \"Tiene un orto que no se puede creer\" may mean \"He/She is incredibly lucky\" but can also be an appraisal of a someone's derrier, depending on context.\n\n\nCagar, just as in Portuguese, is a verb meaning \"to shit.\" It also means to \"screw (something) up\", e.g. \"¡Te cagaste los pantalones!\" (\"You shit your pants!\"). Particularly in Spain and Cuba, there are a number of commonly used interjections incorporating this verb, many of which refer to defecating on something sacred, e.g. \"Me cago en Dios\" (\"I shit on God\"), \"Me cago en la Virgen\" (\"I shit on the Virgin\"), \"Me cago en la hostia\" (\"I shit on the communion host\"), \"Me cago en el coño de tu madre\" (Lit: I shit in your mother's cunt) is the strongest offense among Cubans. In Cuba, to soften the word in social gatherings, the \"g\" is substituted by the \"s\". See below.\n\nIn Venezuela, Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Cuba, Chile and Panama it also means to make a big mistake or damage something i.e. fuck something up, e.g.: \"La cagaste\" (lit.: \"you shat on it\") or \"Nos van a cagar.\" (\"They're going to fuck us\"). In Argentina and Chile, it can also mean \"you screwed\" or \"scolded\" somebody (e.g.: \"Te cagaste a ese cabrón\", \"You took a shit on that guy\"). In Panama \"la cagada\" (\"the shit\") refers to something or someone that makes everything else go wrong or the one detail that is wrong about something (and is thus the complete opposite of the American slang \"the shit\"); e.g., \"Ese man es la cagada\" (\"That dude is the shit\" i.e. a fuck up/fucks everything up), \"La cagada aqui es el tranque\" (\"Traffic jams are the shit here\" i.e. are fucked up, fuck this place/everything up).\n\nIn Mexico City it may be used ironically to refer to a fortunate outcome: \"Te cagaste\" (\"You really shat on yourself\") or an unfortunate outcome such as \"Estás cagado\" meaning \"you're fucked\".\n\nIn Chile and Cuba, cagado (\"full of shit\") means \"stingy\" or \"miserly\". It can also mean \"depressed\" in some contexts (\"Está cagado porque la polola lo pateó.\" translates as \"He's depressed because his girlfriend dumped him.\").\n\nAlso, in Chile it can also have a more neutral connotation. \"La cagó\" (\"shat it\") can be used to agree on a previous statement (\"Chilean Spanish makes no sense\", \"Sí, la cagó\")\n\nMierda is a noun meaning \"shit.\" However, phrases such as \"Vete a la mierda\" (literally: \"Go to (the) shit\") would translate as \"Go fuck yourself.\"\n\nIn Cuba, comemierda (shit-eater) refers to a clueless idiot, someone absurdly pretentious, or someone out of touch with his or her surroundings. Ex. \"que comemierderia\" (how stupid), \"comerán mierda?\" (are they stupid or what?) or \"vamos a prestar atención y dejar de comer mierda\" (Let's pay attention and stop goofing off). It is also used in both countries to describe someone who is \"stuffy\" and unnecessarily formal. In Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic comemierda refers solely to a snobbish person, while in Panama it refers to someone who is both snobbish and mean and/or hypocritical.\n\nIn Peru, \"irse a la mierda\" means \"to be drunk as Hell.\" In Mexico, Cuba, Chile and also in Peru \"estar hecho mierda\" means to be very exhausted.\n\nIn northern Mexico and the southwestern United States (particularly California), the phrase mierda de toro(s) (literally \"shit from bull(s)\") is used often as a Spanish translation of bullshit in response to what is seen by the Spanish speaker as perceived nonsense.\n\nIt is also used generally to describe anything that is vexing or unpleasant, such as \"tiempo de mierda\" (\"shitty weather\") or \"auto de mierda\" (\"piece-of-shit car\"). A less common use is as a translation of the British profanity \"bugger\". The euphemisms miércoles (Wednesday) and eme (the letter \"m\") are sometimes used as minced oaths.\n\nCaca is a mild word used mostly by children, loosely comparable to the English \"poop\" or \"doo-doo.\" Comecaca is functionally similar to comemierdas.\n\n'Mojon' A term originally meaning a little marker of the name of the street or a particular place in a road, it later went into general use to refer to a turd and thus became a synonym for shit; it is used freely as a substitute. In Cuba, the term \"comemojones\" is frequently used instead of \"comemierda\"; \"Es un mojón.\" (\"He's a piece of shit.\") is also commonly used in said country.\n\nMaricón (lit.: \"big Mary\" [see below for explanation]) and its derivative words \"marica\" and \"marico\" are words used for referring to a man as a gay, or for criticizing someone for doing something that, according to stereotypes, only a gay person would do (marica was originally the diminutive of the very common female name \"María del Carmen\", a usage that has been lost). The suffix is -on is often added to nouns to intensify their meaning.\n\nIn Spain, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and Cuba the word has a stronger meaning with a very negative emphasis; akin to \"faggot\" or \"poof\" in the English language. In Guatemala, to \"walz\" means to shove Pringles cans into one's anus. In Argentina, Peru, Chile, and Mexico \"maricón\" or \"marica\" is especially used to denote a \"chicken\" (coward). In Chile, \"maricón\" also means \"irrationally sadistic.\"\n\nSome examples of the uses of this word are:\n\nOne important exception is Colombia, where \"marica\" is used as a slang term of affection among male friends or as a general exclamation (\"\"¡Ay, marica!\"\" being equivalent to \"Aw, man!\" or \"Dude!\" in English). as in Bucaramanga \"marica\" can also mean 'naive' or 'dull' you can hear sentences like \"No, marica, ese marica si es mucho marica tan marica, marica\", (Hey dude, that guy is such a fool faggot, boy) This often causes confusion or unintended offense among Spanish-speaking first-time visitors to Colombia. \"Maricón\", however, remains an insulting and profane term for homosexuals in Colombia as well. A similar case is seen in Venezuela, where the word \"marico\" is an insult; However, the word is widely used among Venezuelans as \"dude\" or \"man.\" For example, \"¿qué pasó marico?\" would mean \"what's up dude?\" The word carries at least a third meaning in Venezuela because it often is used to show that someone is being very funny. For instance, after hearing a joke or funny comment from your friend, you laugh and say \"haha sí eres marico haha\" which would be equivalent to \"haha you crack me up man.\"\n\nDerivatives of \"marica\"/\"maricón\":\n\nManflor (combination of the English loanword \"man\" and the word \"flor\" meaning \"flower\") and its variant manflora (a play on \"manflor\" using the word \"flora\") are used in Mexico and in the US to refer, usually pejoratively, to a homosexual female or lesbian. (In Eastern Guatemala, the variation \"mamplor\" is used.) It is used in very much the same way as the English word \"dyke.\" For example: \"Oye, güey, no toques a esa chica; todos ya saben que es monflora.\" (\"Hey, dude, don't hit on that girl; everyone knows she's a dyke.\"). It can be used as an ironic term of endearment between friends, especially within the gay and lesbian communities.\n\nMany terms offensive to homosexuals imply spreading, e.g.: the use of wings to fly.\n\nWith Spanish being a grammatically-gendered language, one's sexuality can be challenged with a gender-inapproriate adjective, much as in English one might refer to a flamboyant man or a transgender man as \"her\". Some words referring to a male homosexual end in an \"a\" but have the masculine article \"el\"—a deliberate grammatical violation. For example, although \"maricona\" refers to females, it may also be used as a compounded offensive remark towards a homosexual male, and vice-versa.\n\nchocho means literally a senile person, from the verb \"chochear\".\n\nPendejo (according to the \"Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española\", lit.: \"a pubic hair' is, according to the Chicano poet José Antonio Burciaga, \"basically describes someone who is stupid or does something stupid.\" Burciaga said that the word is often used while not in polite conversation. It may be translated as \"dumbass\" or \"asshole\" in many situations, though it carries an extra implication of willful incompetence, or innocent gullibility that's ripe for others to exploit. The less extreme meaning, which is used in most Spanish speaking countries, translates more or less as \"jackass.\" The term, however, has very highly offensive connotations in Puerto Rico. An older usage was in reference to a man who is in denial about being cheated (for example, by his wife).\n\nBurciaga said that \"pendejo\" \"is probably the least offensive\" of the various Spanish profanity words beginning in \"p,\" but that calling someone a \"pendejo\" is \"stronger\" than calling someone \"estúpido\". Burciaga said \"Among friends it can be taken lightly, but for others it is better to be angry enough to back it up.\"\n\nIn Mexico, \"pendejo\" most commonly refers to a \"fool\", \"idiot\" or \"asshole\". In Mexico there are many proverbs that refer to \"pendejos\".\n\nIn Peru it means a person who is opportunistic in an immoral or deceptively persuasive manner (usually involving sexual gain and promiscuity, but not limited to it), and if used referring to a female (\"ella es pendeja\") it means she is promiscuous (or perhaps a swindler). There the word \"pendejada\" and a whole family of related words have meanings that stem from these.\n\nIn South America \"pendejo\" is also a vulgar, yet inoffensive word, for children. It also signifies a person with a disorderly or irregular life. In Argentina pendejo (or pendeja for females) is a pejorative way of saying pibe. The word, in Chile, Colombia, and El Salvador, can refer to a cocaine dealer or it can refer to a \"fool.\"\n\nIn Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic, it has different meanings depending on the situation. It can range from \"¡Te cogieron de pendejo!\" (\"You were swindled!\") to \"¡Qué tipa pendeja!\" (\"What a dumbass!\" as when a strange woman behaves offensively, then suddenly leaves). In Mexico and some countries of Central America—especially El Salvador—\"una pendejada\"/\"pendeja\" is used to describe something incredibly stupid that someone has done.\n\nIn many regions, especially in Cuba, \"pendejo\" also means coward (with a stronger connotation), as in \"¡No huyas, pendejo!\" \"Don't run away, chicken-shit!\" or \"No seas pendejo!\" (\"Don't be such a coward!\").\n\nIn South America it refers to a person regarded with an obnoxiously determined advancement of one's own personality, wishes, or views (a \"smartass\").\n\nIn Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, \"pendejo\" or \"pendeja\" refers to a child, usually with a negative connotation, like that of immaturity or a \"brat\". Also, in Argentina, as \"pendejo\" literally means \"pubic hair\" it usually refers to someone of little to no social value.\n\nIn Peru, however, it does not necessarily have a negative connotation, and can just refer to someone who is clever and street-smart.\n\nIn the Philippines, it is usually used to refer to a man whose wife or partner is cheating on him.\n\nIn North Sulawesi, Indonesia, pendo (a derivative of \"pendejo\") is used as profanity but with the majority of the population not knowing its meaning. The word was adopted during the colonial era when Spanish and Portuguese merchants sailed to this northern tip of Indonesia for spices.\n\nIn the American film \"Idiocracy\", Joe Bauers' idiot lawyer is named Frito Pendejo.\n\nBurciaga says that the Yiddish word \"putz\" \"means the same thing\" as \"pendejo\".\n\nCabrón (lit.: \"big goat\" or \"stubborn goat\" the primitive sense of the word, \"cabrón\" is an adult male goat (\"cabra\" for an adult female goat) and is not offensive in Spain. It is also used as an insult, based on an old usage similar to that of \"pendejo\", namely, to imply that the subject is stubborn or in denial about being cheated, hence the man has \"horns\" like a goat (extremely insulting).\n\nThe word is offensive in Mexico, Cuba and Puerto Rico, as it means \"asshole\" and other insults in English. The seven-note musical flourish known as \"Shave and a Haircut (Two Bits)\", commonly played on car horns, is associated with the seven-syllable phrase \"¡Chinga tu madre, cabrón!\" (Go fuck your mother, asshole!). Playing the jingle on a car horn can result in a hefty fine for traffic violation if done in the presence of police, or road rage if aimed at another driver or a pedestrian. In Mexico, \"cabrón\" refers to a man whose wife cheats on him without protest from him, or even with his encouragement.\nThe expression \"¡Ah cabrón!\" is used sometimes when one is shocked/surprised by something. Among close friends, the term is often inoffensive; however, it is not a word to be used casually with strangers.\n\nAs an adjective it is equivalent to \"tough\" as \"It is tough\" (\"Está cabrón\").\n\nTo some extent, it can also be used with an ironically positive connotation meaning \"great\", \"amazing\", \"phenomenal\", or \"bad-ass\". Such expressions would be said as: \"¡Estás cabrón!\" or \"¡Yo soy cabrón!\". The word is quite flexibly used in Puerto Rico, and it can even have completely opposite meanings depending on the context. Best friends call each other \"\"cabrón\"\" in a friendly manner, while it may also be used in an offensive manner. One might say, \"Esta cabrón\" to describe something as very good or very bad depending on the circumstance.\n\nIn Panama, it is used as an adjective to mean something/someone very annoying (who pisses you off). The verb cabrear can mean \"to piss off (someone)\". This verb form is also used in Chile.\n\nIn Peru, cabro is a reference to a homosexual, hence \"cabrón\" is a superlative form (\"big faggot\"/\"flaming faggot\").\n\nThe term \"cabrón\" also means a handler of prostitutes, comparable to \"pimp\" in English. The most common way to refer to a pimp is Spanish is by using the term chulo as a noun. In some countries chulo can be used as an adjective somewhat equivalent to \"cool\" (\"Ese hombre es un chulo\" = \"That man is a pimp\" versus \"Ese libro es chulo\" = \"That book is cool\"). The word chula is a completely benign reference to an adorable female or feminine object, as in \"¡Ay, que chula!\". In Chile, however, \"chulo\" and \"chula\" always mean \"vulgar\".\n\nGilipollas (and rarely gilipolla) is a term used mostly in Spain and lacking an exact translation to English; the most frequent equivalents when translated in books, films other media are \"jerk\", \"jackass\", \"douchebag\", \"asshole\" or \"buffoon\" (in English), \"con\" (in French), and \"boludo\" or \"pendejo\".\n\nThe canonical definition of a \"gilipollas\" is a person whose behavior, speech, outlook or general demeanor is inconsistent with the actual or potential consequences of their own intellectual inadequacy. Paragons of this taxon include stupid people unaware of their own stupidity or unwilling to accept the consequences thereof, people with an ostensible lack of self-criticism, people unable to realize their own limitations, people who engage in repeated self-defeating behavior, and even a category which is seldom captured in languages other than European Spanish—to wit, people characterized by \"self-aware\" idiocy or incompetence, with this self-awareness occasionally stressed to the point of (presumably futile) complacency.\n\nBy extension, its use in daily life is dedicated to any of the following types of people:\n\nOccasionally it may be used for people who appear to be unpleasant or stupid (without necessarily being either) out of extreme social ineptitude.\n\nWhen selecting a word denoting low intelligence, most Spanish speakers have three options:\n\nThe etymology of the word itself immediately confirms its genuinely Peninsular Spanish origins and preponderance, as opposed to other profanities perhaps more linked to Latin America: it is the combination of the Caló jili, usually translated as \"candid\", \"silly\" or \"idiot\", and a word which according to different sources is either \"polla\" (listed above) or a colloquial evolution thereto of the Latin pulla (bladder).\n\nPerhaps due to the alternative origins of the latter part of the word, there has been some controversy concerning its status as a \"real\" profanity, although its clear phonetic evocation of the word \"polla\" leaves little room for doubt, at least in its common daily use. It is due to this that attempts at an euphemism have at times become popular, as is the case with gilipuertas (\"puerta\" standing for door). Recently, similar phrases have appeared, especially in Spain, although most of them (such as soplapollas, \"cock-blower\") delve much further into plain profanity.\n\nA usual derivation of the word \"gilipollas\" into an adjective form (or a false adjectival participle) is agilipollado/agilipollada. For example: \"… está agilipollado/a\" would mean \"… is behaving like a \"gilipollas\".\" Regardless of whether or not such condition or irreversible, the verb \"estar\" is always used, as opposed to \"ser\". Another Spanish construction with similar rationale is atontado, derived from tonto (\"silly\").\n\nA noun form of the word is gilipollez, meaning \"stupidity\" or \"nonsense.\"\n\nCapullo (lit: \"cocoon\" or \"flower bud\", also slang for glans penis) is nearly always interchangeable with that of \"gilipollas\". The main difference between the two of them is that while a \"gilipollas\" normally behaves as he does out of sheer stupidity, a \"capullo\" normally acts like one by applying certain amount of evil intentions to his acts. While one can act like a \"gilipollas\" without being one, in the \"capullo\" instance that is not possible. A near-exact English translation is wanker. In English \"to be\" means at the same time both the permanent/ fundamental characteristics and the non-permanent/ circumstantial ones of anything, in Spanish \"to be\" separates into two distinct verbs: \"ser\" and \"estar\" which respectively reflect the aforementioned characteristics. So, to say about anyone that \"es un gilipollas\" means that he is stupid/ annoying permanently, while to say \"está agilipollado\" reflects both his present state and the fact that it could change at any time to a non \"agilipollado\" one. This is not true for a \"capullo\": if someone thinks about someone else that he is a \"capullo\", he thinks so permanently, because the degree of evil he sees in the \"capullo's\" actions tends to be thought of as a permanent characteristic, inherent to the \"capullo\"'s personality. So the correspondent verb \"ser\" would be used: \"es un capullo\", and the \"estar\" verb would never be used.\n\nWhenever used as an affectionate or heavily informal form of teasing rather than as an insult, though, \"capullo\" is used a bit more often. This may be because someone who does not have an intention to offend will resort to a lower amount of syllables, hence rendering the expression less coarse and ill-sounding. Therefore, expressions such as \"venga ya, no seas ___\" (\"come on, don't be silly\") would use \"capullo\" more frequently than \"gilipollas\".\n\n\"Buey/Huey/Güey/Wey/We\" is a common term in Mexico, coming from the word \"buey\" that literally means \"ox\" or \"steer.\" It means \"stupid\" or a \"cheated husband/boyfriend/cuckold.\"\n\nIt can be used as a less offensive substitute for \"cabrón\" when used among close friends. Mexican teenagers and young Chicano men use this word routinely in referring to one another, similar to \"dude\" in English. \"\"Vato\"\" is the older Mexican word for this.\n\nJoto (lit.: the \"jack\" or a \"knave\" in a Western deck of cards) is used in Mexico and the southwestern United States, usually pejoratively, in reference to an over-sexed male. Arguably more offensive than \"maricón\", \"joto\" usually refers to a man who is indifferent to pertinent matters, or who is a \"loser\", with perhaps a hinted accusation of closeted homosexuality. For example, a gay man in Mexico might derisively refer to himself as a \"maricón\", but probably not as a \"joto\". Recently the use of \"joto\" in Mexico has changed, and is being embraced by the gay community, mainly as an adjective: \"Es una película muy jota\" (\"It's a very gay movie\"). Not to be confused with the word \"jota\", which refers to a traditional Spanish, Mexican or Argentine parlor dance.\n\nMadre, depending on its usage (for example: madrear—\"to beat\" or hasta la madre—\"full\"), is an insult to one's mother. This dishonors her, and the reputation of the family. It can be profane in Mexico, where there is a cultural taboo against matriarchal families (because of associations with pagan witchcraft). Chinga tu madre (\"Fuck your mother\") is considered to be extremely offensive.\n\n\"Madre\" could be used to reference objects, like \"¡Qué poca madre!\" (\"That's terrible!\") and \"Este madre no funciona\" (\"This shit doesn't work\"). It can also be used with an ironically positive connotation, as in \"¡Está de poca/puta madre!\" (\"It's fucking awesome!\").\n\nMadrazo, in Colombia, refers to insults in general, and \"echar madrazos\" means \"to insult/curse somebody out.\"\n\nPinche has different meanings, depending on geographic location.\n\nIn Spain, where Spanish originated, the word is not offensive and it mostly refers to a scullion, which is a restaurant chef assistant who is assigned to menial kitchen tasks like preparing ingredients and utensils as well as cleaning them after the cooking. It is seldom used as an insult, as in \"pinche güey\" (\"loser\"), or to describe an object of poor quality, \"está muy pinche\" (\"It really sucks\"), but only to a lesser extent. Many restaurants in Spain have the name \"El Pinche\", to the great amusement of Mexican and Chicano tourists.\n\nIn Mexico, the saying can range anywhere from semi-inappropriate to very offensive depending on tone and context. Furthermore, it is often equivalent to the English terms \"damn\", \"freakin'\", \"bloody\" or \"fuckin'\", as in \"estos pinches aguacates están podridos…\" (\"These damn avocados are rotten…\"); \"Pinche Mario ya no ha venido…\" (\"Freakin' Mario hasn't come yet\"); or \"¿¡Quieres callarte la pinche boca!?\" (\"Would you like to shut your fuckin' mouth?\"), but most likely should be translated to the euphemism \"frickin'\" in most situations. Therefore, it can be said in front of adults, but possibly not children, depending on one's moral compass. Sometimes \"pinchudo(a)\" is said instead. It also refers to a mean-spirited person or someone who is stingy: \"Él es muy pinche.\" (\"He is very stingy.\")..\n\nIn Chile, \"pinche\" isn't vulgar, and it refers to the people involved in an informal romantic relationship with each other. The verbal form \"pinchar\" can be translated as \"kissing\" or \"make out\". \"Pinchar\" also means \"to ping\" (the act of calling someone and then hanging up with the intent of having them call back).\n\nIn Puerto Rico \"pinche\" simply refers to a hairpin, while \"pincho\" has the same meaning in Dominican Spanish.\n\nPolla (lit.: \"female \"pollo\"\", i.e.: chicken or hen) is used in Spain, Nicaragua, El Salvador and to a lesser extent in Puerto Rico. It is also used to mean a (young) female (similar to \"chick\"). Some years ago, in Costa Rica, the term jupa de pollo (\"head of a chicken\") was popular slang for \"penis\". The term todo el jupa de pollo was a popular way to say \"the whole shebang\", \"the full Monty\" or \"it's complete now\".\n\nIn Spain, to say that something, especially a situation or an arrangement, is la polla is to have a high opinion of it. \"Esto es la polla. El hotel está al lado de la playa y además es muy barato\" means \"This is fucking great. The hotel is close to the beach and it's cheap, too.\"\n\n\"Polla\" in Spain also means penis.\n\nPuta literally means whore, and can be extended to any woman who is sexually promiscuous. This word is common to all other Romance languages (it is \"puta\" also in Portuguese and Catalan, \"pute\"/\"putain\" in French, \"puttana\" in Italian, and so on) and almost certainly comes from the Vulgar Latin \"putta\" (from \"puttus\", alteration of \"putus\" \"boy\"), although the Royal Spanish Academy lists its origins as \"uncertain\" (unlike other dictionaries, such as the María Moliner, which state \"putta\" as its origin). It is a derogatory way to refer to a prostitute, while the formal Spanish word for a prostitute is \"prostituta\".\n\n\nIn the Spanish region of La Mancha is very common the formation of neologisms, to refer with humoristic sense to a certain way of being some people, by the union of two terms, usually a verb and a noun. E.g., capaliendres (lit. \"(person) who geld nits\", \"miser, niggard\"), (d)esgarracolchas (lit. \"(person) who rends quilts\", \"awkward\", \"untrustworthy\"), pisacristos (lit. \"(person) who tramples Christs\"—\"blasphemous person\"), and much more.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2321606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321606", "title": "Degrees of freedom (statistics)", "text": "Degrees of freedom (statistics)\n\nIn statistics, the number of degrees of freedom is the number of values in the final calculation of a statistic that are free to vary.\n\nThe number of independent ways by which a dynamic system can move, without violating any constraint imposed on it, is called number of degrees of freedom. In other words, the number of degrees of freedom can be defined as the minimum number of independent coordinates that can specify the position of the system completely.\n\nEstimates of statistical parameters can be based upon different amounts of information or data. The number of independent pieces of information that go into the estimate of a parameter are called the degrees of freedom. In general, the degrees of freedom of an estimate of a parameter are equal to the number of independent scores that go into the estimate minus the number of parameters used as intermediate steps in the estimation of the parameter itself (most of the time the sample variance has \"N\" − 1 degrees of freedom, since it is computed from \"N\" random scores minus the only 1 parameter estimated as intermediate step, which is the sample mean).\n\nMathematically, degrees of freedom is the number of dimensions of the domain of a random vector, or essentially the number of \"free\" components (how many components need to be known before the vector is fully determined).\n\nThe term is most often used in the context of linear models (linear regression, analysis of variance), where certain random vectors are constrained to lie in linear subspaces, and the number of degrees of freedom is the dimension of the subspace. The degrees of freedom are also commonly associated with the squared lengths (or \"sum of squares\" of the coordinates) of such vectors, and the parameters of chi-squared and other distributions that arise in associated statistical testing problems.\n\nWhile introductory textbooks may introduce degrees of freedom as distribution parameters or through hypothesis testing, it is the underlying geometry that defines degrees of freedom, and is critical to a proper understanding of the concept.\n\nAlthough the basic concept of degrees of freedom was recognized as early as 1821 in the work of astronomer and mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, its modern definition and usage was first elaborated by English statistician William Sealy Gosset in his 1908 \"Biometrika\" article \"The Probable Error of a Mean\", published under the pen name \"Student\". While Gosset did not actually use the term 'degrees of freedom', he explained the concept in the course of developing what became known as Student's t-distribution. The term itself was popularized by English statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher, beginning with his 1922 work on chi squares.\n\nIn equations, the typical symbol for degrees of freedom is \"ν\" (lowercase Greek letter nu). In text and tables, the abbreviation \"d.f.\" is commonly used. R. A. Fisher used \"n\" to symbolize degrees of freedom but modern usage typically reserves \"n\" for sample size.\n\nGeometrically, the degrees of freedom can be interpreted as the dimension of certain vector subspaces. As a starting point, suppose that we have a sample of independent normally distributed observations,\n\nThis can be represented as an \"n\"-dimensional random vector:\n\nSince this random vector can lie anywhere in \"n\"-dimensional space, it has \"n\" degrees of freedom.\n\nNow, let formula_3 be the sample mean. The random vector can be decomposed as the sum of the sample mean plus a vector of residuals:\n\nThe first vector on the right-hand side is constrained to be a multiple of the vector of 1's, and the only free quantity is formula_3. It therefore has 1 degree of freedom.\n\nThe second vector is constrained by the relation formula_6. The first \"n\" − 1 components of this vector can be anything. However, once you know the first \"n\" − 1 components, the constraint tells you the value of the \"n\"th component. Therefore, this vector has \"n\" − 1 degrees of freedom.\n\nMathematically, the first vector is the orthogonal, or least-squares, projection of the data vector onto the subspace spanned by the vector of 1's. The 1 degree of freedom is the dimension of this subspace. The second residual vector is the least-squares projection onto the (\"n\" − 1)-dimensional orthogonal complement of this subspace, and has \"n\" − 1 degrees of freedom.\n\nIn statistical testing applications, often one is not directly interested in the component vectors, but rather in their squared lengths. In the example above, the residual sum-of-squares is\n\nIf the data points formula_8 are normally distributed with mean 0 and variance formula_9, then the residual sum of squares has a scaled chi-squared distribution (scaled by the factor formula_9), with \"n\" − 1 degrees of freedom. The degrees-of-freedom, here a parameter of the distribution, can still be interpreted as the dimension of an underlying vector subspace.\n\nLikewise, the one-sample \"t\"-test statistic,\nfollows a Student's t distribution with \"n\" − 1 degrees of freedom when the hypothesized mean formula_12 is correct. Again, the degrees-of-freedom arises from the residual vector in the denominator.\n\nWhen the results of structural equation models (SEM) are presented, they generally include one or more indices of overall model fit, the most common of which is a χ statistic. This forms the basis for other indices that are commonly reported. Although it is these other statistics that are most commonly interpreted, the \"degrees of freedom\" of the χ are essential to understanding model fit as well as the nature of the model itself.\n\nDegrees of freedom in SEM are computed as a difference between the number of unique pieces of information that are used as input into the analysis, sometimes called knowns, and the number of parameters that are uniquely estimated, sometimes called unknowns. For example, in a one-factor confirmatory factor analysis with 4 items, there are 10 knowns (the six unique covariances among the four items and the four item variances) and 8 unknowns (4 factor loadings and 4 error variances) for 2 degrees of freedom. Degrees of freedom are important to the understanding of model fit if for no other reason than that, all else being equal, the fewer degrees of freedom, the better indices such as χ will be.\n\nIt has been shown that degrees of freedom can be used by readers of papers that contain SEMs to determine if the authors of those papers are in fact reporting the correct model fit statistics. In the organizational sciences, for example, nearly half of papers published in top journals report degrees of freedom that are inconsistent with the models described in those papers, leaving the reader to wonder which models were actually tested.\n\nA common way to think of degrees of freedom is as the number of independent pieces of information available to estimate another piece of information. More concretely, the number of degrees of freedom is the number of independent observations in a sample of data that are available to estimate a parameter of the population from which that sample is drawn. For example, if we have two observations, when calculating the mean we have two independent observations; however, when calculating the variance, we have only one independent observation, since the two observations are equally distant from the sample mean.\n\nIn fitting statistical models to data, the vectors of residuals are constrained to lie in a space of smaller dimension than the number of components in the vector. That smaller dimension is the number of \"degrees of freedom for error\", also called \"residual degrees of freedom\".\n\nPerhaps the simplest example is this. Suppose\n\nare random variables each with expected value \"μ\", and let\n\nbe the \"sample mean.\" Then the quantities\n\nare residuals that may be considered estimates of the errors \"X\" − \"μ\". The sum of the residuals (unlike the sum of the errors) is necessarily 0. If one knows the values of any \"n\" − 1 of the residuals, one can thus find the last one. That means they are constrained to lie in a space of dimension \"n\" − 1. One says that there are \"n\" − 1 degrees of freedom for errors.\n\nAn example which is only slightly less simple is that of least squares estimation of \"a\" and \"b\" in the model\n\nwhere \"x\" is given, but e and hence \"Y\" are random. Let formula_17 and formula_18 be the least-squares estimates of \"a\" and \"b\". Then the residuals\n\nare constrained to lie within the space defined by the two equations\n\nOne says that there are \"n\" − 2 degrees of freedom for error.\n\nNotationally, the capital letter \"Y\" is used in specifying the model, while lower-case \"y\" in the definition of the residuals; that is because the former are hypothesized random variables and the latter are actual data.\n\nWe can generalise this to multiple regression involving \"p\" parameters and covariates (e.g. \"p\" − 1 predictors and one mean (=intercept in the regression)), in which case the cost in \"degrees of freedom of the fit\" is \"p\", leaving \"n - p\" degrees of freedom for errors\n\nThe demonstration of the \"t\" and chi-squared distributions for one-sample problems above is the simplest example where degrees-of-freedom arise. However, similar geometry and vector decompositions underlie much of the theory of linear models, including linear regression and analysis of variance. An explicit example based on comparison of three means is presented here; the geometry of linear models is discussed in more complete detail by Christensen (2002).\n\nSuppose independent observations are made for three populations, formula_22, formula_23 and formula_24. The restriction to three groups and equal sample sizes simplifies notation, but the ideas are easily generalized.\n\nThe observations can be decomposed as\nwhere formula_26 are the means of the individual samples, and\nformula_27 is the mean of all 3\"n\" observations. In vector notation this decomposition can be written as\n\nThe observation vector, on the left-hand side, has 3\"n\" degrees of freedom. On the right-hand side, the first vector has one degree of freedom (or dimension) for the overall mean. The second vector depends on three random variables, formula_29, formula_30 and formula_31. However, these must sum to 0 and so are constrained; the vector therefore must lie in a 2-dimensional subspace, and has 2 degrees of freedom. The remaining 3\"n\" − 3 degrees of freedom are in the residual vector (made up of \"n\" − 1 degrees of freedom within each of the populations).\n\nIn statistical testing problems, one usually is not interested in the component vectors themselves, but rather in their squared lengths, or Sum of Squares. The degrees of freedom associated with a sum-of-squares is the degrees-of-freedom of the corresponding component vectors.\n\nThe three-population example above is an example of one-way Analysis of Variance. The model, or treatment, sum-of-squares is the squared length of the second vector,\nwith 2 degrees of freedom. The residual, or error, sum-of-squares is\nwith 3(\"n\"−1) degrees of freedom. Of course, introductory books on ANOVA usually state formulae without showing the vectors, but it is this underlying geometry that gives rise to SS formulae, and shows how to unambiguously determine the degrees of freedom in any given situation.\n\nUnder the null hypothesis of no difference between population means (and assuming that standard ANOVA regularity assumptions are satisfied) the sums of squares have scaled chi-squared distributions, with the corresponding degrees of freedom. The F-test statistic is the ratio, after scaling by the degrees of freedom. If there is no difference between population means this ratio follows an \"F\"-distribution with 2 and 3\"n\" − 3 degrees of freedom.\n\nIn some complicated settings, such as unbalanced split-plot designs, the sums-of-squares no longer have scaled chi-squared distributions. Comparison of sum-of-squares with degrees-of-freedom is no longer meaningful, and software may report certain fractional 'degrees of freedom' in these cases. Such numbers have no genuine degrees-of-freedom interpretation, but are simply providing an \"approximate\" chi-squared distribution for the corresponding sum-of-squares. The details of such approximations are beyond the scope of this page.\n\nSeveral commonly encountered statistical distributions (Student's \"t\", chi-squared, \"F\") have parameters that are commonly referred to as \"degrees of freedom\". This terminology simply reflects that in many applications where these distributions occur, the parameter corresponds to the degrees of freedom of an underlying random vector, as in the preceding ANOVA example. Another simple example is: if formula_34 are independent normal formula_35 random variables, the statistic\nfollows a chi-squared distribution with \"n\" − 1 degrees of freedom. Here, the degrees of freedom arises from the residual sum-of-squares in the numerator, and in turn the \"n\" − 1 degrees of freedom of the underlying residual vector formula_37.\n\nIn the application of these distributions to linear models, the degrees of freedom parameters can take only integer values. The underlying families of distributions allow fractional values for the degrees-of-freedom parameters, which can arise in more sophisticated uses. One set of examples is problems where chi-squared approximations based on effective degrees of freedom are used. In other applications, such as modelling heavy-tailed data, a t or \"F\"-distribution may be used as an empirical model. In these cases, there is no particular \"degrees of freedom\" interpretation to the distribution parameters, even though the terminology may continue to be used.\n\nMany non-standard regression methods, including regularized least squares (e.g., ridge regression), linear smoothers, smoothing splines, and semiparametric regression are not based on ordinary least squares projections, but rather on regularized (generalized and/or penalized) least-squares, and so degrees of freedom defined in terms of dimensionality is generally not useful for these procedures. However, these procedures are still linear in the observations, and the fitted values of the regression can be expressed in the form\nwhere formula_39 is the vector of fitted values at each of the original covariate values from the fitted model, \"y\" is the original vector of responses, and \"H\" is the hat matrix or, more generally, smoother matrix.\n\nFor statistical inference, sums-of-squares can still be formed: the model sum-of-squares is formula_40; the residual sum-of-squares is formula_41. However, because \"H\" does not correspond to an ordinary least-squares fit (i.e. is not an orthogonal projection), these sums-of-squares no longer have (scaled, non-central) chi-squared distributions, and dimensionally defined degrees-of-freedom are not useful.\n\nThe \"effective degrees of freedom\" of the fit can be defined in various ways to implement goodness-of-fit tests, cross-validation, and other statistical inference procedures. Here one can distinguish between \"regression effective degrees of freedom\" and \"residual effective degrees of freedom\".\n\nFor the regression effective degrees of freedom, appropriate definitions can include the trace of the hat matrix, tr(\"H\"), the trace of the quadratic form of the hat matrix, tr(\"H'H\"), the form tr(2\"H\" – \"H\" \"H\"'), or the Satterthwaite approximation, . In the case of linear regression, the hat matrix \"H\" is \"X\"(\"X\"<nowiki> '</nowiki>\"X\")\"X<nowiki> '</nowiki>\", and all these definitions reduce to the usual degrees of freedom. Notice that\n\nthe regression (not residual) degrees of freedom in linear models are \"the sum of the sensitivities of the fitted values with respect to the observed response values\", i.e. the sum of leverage scores.\n\nOne way to help to conceptualize this is to consider a simple smoothing matrix like a Gaussian blur function. The Gaussian blur is an attempt to estimate the values of a smoothly varying function from otherwise noisy data. In contrast to a simple linear or polynomial fit, computing the effective degrees of freedom of the smoothing function is not straight-forward. In these cases, it is important to estimate the Degrees of Freedom permitted by the formula_43 matrix so that the residual degrees of freedom can then be used to estimate statistical tests such as formula_44.\n\nThere are corresponding definitions of residual effective degrees-of-freedom (redf), with \"H\" replaced by \"I\" − \"H\". For example, if the goal is to estimate error variance, the redf would be defined as tr((\"I\" − \"H\")'(\"I\" − \"H\")), and the unbiased estimate is (with formula_45),\n\nor:\n\nThe last approximation above reduces the computational cost from \"O\"(\"n\") to only \"O\"(\"n\"). In general the numerator would be the objective function being minimized; e.g., if the hat matrix includes an observation covariance matrix, Σ, then formula_49 becomes formula_50.\n\nNote that unlike in the original case, non-integer degrees of freedom are allowed, though the value must usually still be constrained between 0 and \"n\".\n\nConsider, as an example, the \"k\"-nearest neighbour smoother, which is the average of the \"k\" nearest measured values to the given point. Then, at each of the \"n\" measured points, the weight of the original value on the linear combination that makes up the predicted value is just 1/\"k\". Thus, the trace of the hat matrix is \"n/k\". Thus the smooth costs \"n/k\" effective degrees of freedom.\n\nAs another example, consider the existence of nearly duplicated observations. Naive application of classical formula, \"n\" − \"p\", would lead to over-estimation of the residuals degree of freedom, as if each observation were independent. More realistically, though, the hat matrix would involve an observation covariance matrix Σ indicating the non-zero correlation among observations. The more general formulation of effective degree of freedom would result in a more realistic estimate for, e.g., the error variance σ, which in its turn scales the unknown parameters' \"a posteriori\" standard deviation; the degree of freedom will also affect the expansion factor necessary to produce an error ellipse for a given confidence level.\n\nSimilar concepts are the \"equivalent degrees of freedom\" in non-parametric regression, the \"degree of freedom of signal\" in atmospheric studies, and the \"non-integer degree of freedom\" in geodesy.\n\nThe residual sum-of-squares formula_41 has a generalized chi-squared distribution, and the theory associated with this distribution provides an alternative route to the answers provided above.\n\n\n\n"}

Gurdaspur is the district headquarters. It internationally borders Narowal District of the Pakistani Punjab, the Punjab districts of Amritsar, Pathankot, Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur. Two main rivers Beas and Ravi passes through the district. The Mughal emperor Akbar is said to have been enthroned in a garden near Kalanaur, a historically important town in the district. The district is at the foothills of the Himalayas.\n\nAs of 2011 it is the third most populous district of Punjab (out of 22), after Ludhiana and Amritsar. Batala, with 31% of the district's population, is its largest city.\n\nFrom the latter half of the 10th century up to 1919 A.D. this district was ruled by the Shahi dynasty under Jayapal and Anandpal. Kalanaur in this district was the most important town during the period of Delhi Emperor from the 14th to 16th centuries. It was twice attacked by Jasrath Khokhar, once after his unsuccessful assault on Lahore in 1422 and again in 1428 when Malik Sikander marched to relieve the place and defeated Jasrath AkIar was installed by Bairam Khan on a throne on Feb 1556. The messonary, a platform which still exists about a kilometre and a half to the east of the town is the actual spot upon which his installation took place.\n\nIn the decline and fall of the Mughal supremacy and the rise of the Sikh power this district saw its most stirring scenes. Some of the Sikh Gurus have been closely associated with the district. Guru Nanak, born in 1469 in the Lahore district, married in 1485 with Sulkhani, daughter of Mool Chand, a Khatri of Pakhoke (Dera Baba Nanak) in the Batala Tehsil. There is still a wall known as Jhoolana Mahal which swings in Gurdaspur. The Sikh Guru Hargobind refounded Sri Hargobindpur which had been formerly known by the name of Rahila. Banda Singh Bahadur, the disciple of Guru Gobind Singh used this district as a base to raid the country up to Lahore, the emperor Bahadur Shah conducted an expedition against him in 1711 but with only temporary effect. Banda Bahadar fought his last battle with the Mughal at Gurdas Nangal in the district and was captured. The history of the district then degenerates into an account of their struggles with the rival Ramgarhia Misl and Kanhaiya Misls for supremacy in this part of the Doab, the power of the former was broken in 1808 and of the latter in 1811.\n\nMaharaja Ranjit Singh thus assumed way over the whole district. Dina Nagar, with its pleasant mango gardens and running canal was a favourite summer residence of the lion of the Punjab, who when not elsewhere engaged spent the two hot weather months of May and June here.\n\nDuring British Rule the district of Gurdaspur was a subdivision of Lahore Division, the district itself was administratively subdivided into four tehsils: Gurdaspur, Batala, Shakargarh and Pathankot. According to the 1881 census the population of the district was 823,695 this had risen by over 100,000 to 943,922 in the 1891 census. However the 1901 census recorded a fall in population – 940,334, this was largely due to emigration – some 44,000 settlers settling in Chenab colony. According to the 1901 census there were 463,371 Muslims (49%), 380,636 Hindus (over 40%) and 91,756 (10%) Sikhs. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad who founded the Ahmadiyya movement had followers here.\n\nDuring the partition of India in 1947 the future of Gurdaspur was highly contested. According to the 1941 census, the population of this district had a narrow 51.14% Muslim majority. Radcliffe Award of the boundary gave only the Shakargarh tehsil of the district to Pakistan, and the rest to India. The Muslim population of the eastern tehsils migrated to Pakistan as refugees, and the Hindus and Sikhs of Shakargarh migrated to Gurdaspur after crossing the Ravi Bridge. They settled and spread in the Gurdaspur district.\n\nOn 27 July 2011 a part of district is carved out to form a new Pathankot district, which was earlier part of Gurdaspur. The Pathankot district comprises two sub-divisions of Pathankot and Dharkalan along with two sub-tehsils namely Narot Jaimal Singh and Bamial.\n\nThe Gurdaspur district is in the north of Punjab state. It falls in the Jalandhar division and is sandwiched between rivers Ravi and Beas. The district lies between north-latitude 310-36' and 320-34' and east longitude 740-56' and 750-24' and shares common boundaries with Pathankot district in the north, Beas River in the north-east, Hoshiarpur district in the south-east, Kapurthala district in the south, Amritsar district in the south-west and Pakistan in the north-west.\n\nAll the Tehsils of the district namely Gurdaspur, Batala and Dera Baba Nanak are plain and similar to the rest of the Punjab plains in structure. The landscape of the district has varied topography comprising undulating plan, the flood plains of the Ravi and the Beas and the upland plain.\n\nTo its south lies an area of about 128 km which is highly dissected and is an undulating plain. Its elevation ranges from about 305 to 381 metres above sea level. It is traversed by a number of choas and has an undulating topography.\n\nThe flood plains of the Ravi and the Beas are separated from the upland plain by sharp river-cut bluffs. They are low lying, with slightly uneven topography. Sand dominates in the soil structure of the flood plains, but it diminishes in both quantity and coarseness in the upland plain. The upland plain covers a large part of the district particularly. Its elevation ranges from about 305 metres above sea level in the north-east to about 213 metres above sea level in the south-west, with a gentle gradient of about 1 metre in 1.6 km.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census Gurdaspur district has a population of 2,298,323, roughly equal to the nation of Latvia or the US state of New Mexico. This gives it a ranking of 196th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001–2011 was 9.3%. Gurdaspur has a sex ratio of 895 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 79.95%.\n\nHinduism and Sikhism are the main religions of Gurdaspur district. Gurdaspur also has the highest share of Christians in the state.\n\n"}

They were anti-reformists who attempted to stifle the movement led by Saramitra Mahasthabir (\"Saramedha Mahasthavira\" in Pali), which led to the formation of the Sangharaj Nikaya in 1864.\n\nThe anti-reformation movement came into being in order to counter-act that which was led by Saramitra Mahasthabir. This movement became known as the Mahasthabir Nikaya and was led by Radha Charan Mahasthabir, the Bengali monk who first invited Saramitra Mahasthabir to Bangladesh.\n\nHowever, the Mahasthabir did not oppose the Sangharaj on doctrinal grounds - they did not advocate the practices the Sangharaj Nikaya attempted to eradicate. They are doctrinally identical to the Sangharaj Nikaya. The Mahasthabir Nikaya believed that a Bengali Buddhist order should not come under a powerful influence from a foreign entity. They opposed the Sangharaj Nikaya on the grounds that the Sangharaj Nikaya was foreign in origin, not on the grounds that the Sangharaj Nikaya was degenerate. Differences between the lineages are purely practical, i.e., they advocate different day-to-day practices for their monks. As such, differences are extremely minimal, and important only to the monastic sangha. Laity following the different traditions did not particularly differentiate between the two. The distinction served only to maintain an organizational front, not a doctrinal opposition.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2321613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321613", "title": "Dehiscence (botany)", "text": "Dehiscence (botany)\n\nDehiscence is the splitting, at maturity, along a built-in line of weakness in a plant structure in order to release its contents, and is common among fruits, anthers and sporangia. Sometimes this involves the complete detachment of a part. Structures that open in this way are said to be dehiscent. Structures that do not open in this way are called indehiscent, and rely on other mechanisms such as decay or predation to release the contents.\n\nA similar process to dehiscence occurs in some flower buds (e.g., \"Platycodon\", \"Fuchsia\"), but this is rarely referred to as dehiscence unless circumscissile dehiscence is involved; anthesis is the usual term for the opening of flowers. Dehiscence may or may not involve the loss of a structure through the process of abscission. The lost structures are said to be caducous.\n\nManipulation of dehiscence can improve crop yield since a trait that causes seed dispersal is a disadvantage for farmers whose goal is to collect the seed. Many of the agronomically important plants have been bred for reduced shattering.\n\nExplosive dehiscence is a ballistic form of dispersal that flings seeds or spores far from the parent plant. This rapid plant movement can achieve limited dispersal without the assistance of animals. A notable example is the sandbox tree (\"Hura crepitans\"), which can fling seeds 100 meters (300 ft) and has been called the \"dynamite tree\" due to the loud sound it generates. Another example is \"Impatiens\", whose explosive dehiscence is triggered by being touched, leading it to be called the \"touch-me-not.\" \"Ecballium elaterium\", the 'squirting cucumber', uses explosive dehiscence to disperse its seeds, ejecting them from matured fruit in a stream of mucilaginous liquid. Explosive dehiscence of sporangia is a characteristic of \"Sphagnum\".\n\nSepticidal and loculicidal dehiscence may not be completely distinct; in some cases both the septa and the walls of the locules split.\nDehiscence occurs through breakage of various parts of the enclosing structure; the mechanisms can be classified in various ways, but intermediate forms also occur.\n\nDehiscence through a small hole (pore) is referred to as poricidal dehiscence. The pore may have a cover (operculate poricidal dehiscense or operculate dehiscence) that is referred to as an operculum or it may not (inoperculate poricidal dehiscense or inoperculate dehiscence).\n\nPoricidal dehiscence occurs in many unrelated organisms, in fruit, causing the release of seeds, and also in the sporangia of many organisms (flowering plants, ferns, fungi, slime molds). Poricidal anthers of various flowers are associated with buzz pollination by insects.\n\nCircumscissile dehiscence involves a horizontal opening that causes a lid to separate completely. This type of dehiscence occurs in some fruit and anthers and also in some flower buds.\n\nAnther dehiscence is the final function of the anther that causes the release of pollen grains. This process is coordinated precisely with pollen differentiation, floral development, and flower opening.\n\nThe anther wall breaks at a specific site. Usually this site is observed as an indentation between the locules of each theca and runs the length of the anther, but in species with \"poricidal\" anther dehiscence it is instead a small pore. If the pollen is released from the anther through a split on the outer side (relative to the center of the flower), this is extrorse dehiscence, and if the pollen is released from the inner side, this is introrse dehiscence. If the pollen is released through a split that is positioned to the side, towards other anthers, rather than towards the inside or outside of the flower, this is latrorse dehiscence.\n\nThe stomium is the region of the anther where dehiscence occurs. The degeneration of the stomium and septum cells is part of a developmentally timed cell-death program. Expansion of the endothecial layer and subsequent drying are also required for dehiscence. The endothecium tissue is responsible for the tensions that lead to splitting of the anther. This tissue is usually one to several layers thick, with cells walls of uneven thickness due to uneven lignification. The cells lose water, and the uneven thickness causes the thinner walls of the cells to stretch to a greater extent. This creates a tension that eventually leads to the anther being split along its line of weakness and releasing pollen grains to the atmosphere.\n\nFlower buds of \"Eucalyptus\" and related genera open with circumscissile dehiscence. A small cap separates from the remainder of the bud along a circular horizontal zone.\nThere are many different types of fruit dehiscence, that involve different types of structures. Some fruits are indehiscent, and do not open to disperse the seeds. Xerochasy is dehiscence that occurs upon drying, and hygrochasy is dehiscence that occurs upon wetting, the fruit being hygroscopic. Dehiscent fruits that are derived from one carpel are follicles or legumes, and those derived from multiple carpels are capsules or siliques.\n\nOne example of a dehiscent fruit is the silique. This fruit develops from a gynoecium composed of two fused carpels, which, upon fertilization, grow to become a silique that contains the developing seeds. After seed maturation, dehiscence takes place, and valves detach from the central septum freeing the seeds. This is also known as shattering and can be important as a seed dispersal mechanism. This process is similar to anther dehiscence and the region that breaks (dehiscence zone) runs the entire length of the fruit between the valves (the outer walls of the ovary) and the replum (the persisting septa of the ovary). At maturity, the dehiscence zone is effectively a non-lignified layer between two regions of lignified cells in the valve and the replum. Shattering occurs due to the combination of cell wall loosening in the dehiscence zone and the tensions established by the differential mechanical properties of the drying cells.\n\nEndothecium tissue found in moss capsules functions in a similar way in dehiscence to the endothecium in the walls of anthers (see above).\n\nMany leptosporangiate ferns have an annulus around the sporangium, which ejects the spores. Eusporangiate ferns do not generally have specialized dehiscence mechanisms.\n\n"}

They consisted of songwriter Brian Bedford, his wife Jacey Bedford, and Hilary Spencer.\n\nArtisan formed in 1984 when Jacey and Brian Bedford invited Hilary Spencer to sing with them at a concert at Birdsedge Village Hall near Huddersfield in West Yorkshire. Prior to this Hilary had been trained for opera, singing coloratura soprano as an amateur singer with local operatic societies in Sheffield. Brian had attended Huddersfield School of Music (1970–72) and Bretton Hall College of Education (1972–73) and after learning 'cello as a first instrument had entered the teaching profession, teaching primary children at Crofton Shay Lane Junior and Infants - later Crofton Shay Lane Infants (Wakefield MDC education authority) during which time he had responsibility for music throughout the school. Jacey had no formal musical training beyond school choirs (Barnsley Girls' High School 1962-1969).\n\nArtisan's early repertoire was a mixture of traditional and contemporary songs, all performed a cappella (i.e., without instruments) and in three-part close harmony, broadly within the folk genre, though with a cappella versions of some pop standards included. Their trademark sound was developed with Hilary singing strong lead in a much lower range than her original coloratura, with Jacey's softer voice providing a lighter (usually higher) harmony and Brian's voice often being used at the top end of his bass-baritone range so that Hilary and Brian's voices were fairly close together in range, 'glued' together by Jacey's.\n\nAfter five years of performing at UK folk clubs part-time, Artisan went full-time in July 1989 when trio members gave up their day jobs. After that their first European work followed (Belgium, Okapi Folk Festival, Lokeren, and Bokregdag, 1990). In 1994 came their first transatlantic tour to Canada playing the Owen Sound Summerfolk Festival and the Mariposa Folk Festival, followed by a return to Canada and a first tour to the US in 1995 playing Bethlehem Musikfest in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn the next ten years there were thirty tours to the US and Canada playing venues and major festivals including: Vancouver Folk Music Festival; Winnipeg Folk Festival and the Philadelphia Folk Festival. In 2003 they played the Millennium Stage at Washington DC's Kennedy Center. The complete performance is archived on the Kennedy Center site. This is a full recording, unedited, exactly as performed.\n\nThere was also one tour to Australia in 2000 to play the Port Fairy Folk Festival.\n\nThey built a strong fan base, both in the UK and North America. Artisan performed a few traditional folk songs, and songs written by other songwriters; however the majority of their work was penned by Brian Bedford (not to be confused with the actor Brian Bedford). One of their most popular songs is, \"What's the Use of Wings\", written by Brian, about the need to \"let go\" of loved ones, and give them the freedom to make their own decisions. It has been covered by artists and groups including Vin Garbutt (who includes it in his live repertoire), the late John Wright, Marie Little, Gilly Darbey and the Philadelphia Gay Men's Choir.\n\nArtisan concerts were always lively, known for their audience participation, particularly their Christmas concerts (\"Stuff the Turkey\"), which had a pantomime feel to them. The group stopped touring in 2005, with two final concerts held on 20 November 2005.\n\nIn 2010 Artisan came together again for a short, limited date reunion tour to venues and festivals in the UK and Canada.\n\nAs of 2011 Hilary is half of QuickSilver with Grant Baynham.

{"id": "2321640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321640", "title": "Manual fire alarm activation", "text": "Manual fire alarm activation\n\nManual fire alarm activation is typically achieved through the use of a pull station (USA & Canada) or call point (Europe, Australia, and Asia), which then sounds the evacuation alarm for the relevant building or zone. Manual fire alarm activation requires human intervention, as distinct from automatic fire alarm activation such as that provided through the use of heat detectors and smoke detectors. It is, however, possible for call points/pull stations to be used in conjunction with automatic detection as part of an overall fire detection and alarm system. Systems in completed buildings tend to be wired in and to include a control panel. Systems for use during construction can also be wireless or mechanical, however it is recommended by the Structural Timber Association in the UK that for timber-framed constructions, interconnecting wireless systems be used.\n\nA fire alarm pull station is an active fire protection device, usually wall-mounted, that, when activated, initiates an alarm on a fire alarm system. In its simplest form, the user activates the alarm by pulling the handle down, which completes a circuit and locks the handle in the activated position, sending an alarm to the fire alarm control panel. After operation, most fire alarm pull stations must be restored to the ready position using a special tool or key in order for the panel to be reset. Primitive manual stations, requiring only a single action or hand motion to activate, can be subject to unwanted activation by jarring or accidental contact. Early strategies to cope with this problem included requiring the operator to break a pane of glass to release an internal spring-operated mechanism. Manual pull stations that require two hand motions, such as lift up and pull down, or push in and pull down, have since replaced the break-glass and single-action models in many modern installations.\n\nIn the past, pull stations controlled the entire system. These coded pull stations were much bigger than modern pulls and had a code wheel in them. They had a gear mechanism that was wound up when the station was pulled, and (unlike modern pull stations) the handle did not stay down. The gears would turn a small wheel with a specific number of teeth, which determined the coding. The teeth would push up on a contact, which would open and close a circuit, pulsing the code to the bells or horns. This code was used by building security to determine where the alarm was originating from. For example, consider a pull station in the fourth floor elevator lobby of an office building with a code of 5-3-1. When the station was pulled, the security officers in the building would look up 5-3-1 in a master list of codes. After finding the location of the pull, they would check to see if there is a real fire. If there was, they would evacuate the building and call the fire department.\nSystem tests could be conducted in one of two ways: In a coded pull station, there is either a test hole on the front (usually activated with an Allen wrench) or a test switch on the inside. Turning the switch one way causes the notification appliances to sound continuously (or in the case of single-stroke bells, ding once). Turning it the other way and then activating the pull allows a silent test to be done in which the station's mechanical parts are checked to ensure proper function. Once pulled, the station would do at least four rounds of code before resetting itself. Coded pulls were typically used in new fire alarm systems until roughly the 1950s, and then occasionally into the 1970s. Until the early 1990s, some panels were made with an extra zone to accommodate any existing coded pull stations. Nowadays, coded pull stations are very rare and almost never seen in working fire alarm systems.\n\nMany modern fire alarm pull stations are single action and only require the user to pull down the handle to sound the alarm. Other fire alarm pull stations are dual-action, and as such require the user to perform a second task before pulling down, such as lifting up or pushing in a panel on the station or shattering a glass panel with an attached hammer. Perhaps the most recognizable pull station is the \"T-bar\"-style pull station, so named because the handle is shaped like the letter \"T\". This style is manufactured by many companies, most notably SimplexGrinnell. \nResetting a fire alarm pull station after it has been operated normally requires building personnel or emergency responders to open the station using a key, which often is either a hex key or a more traditional key. Opening the station causes the handle to go back to its original position, allowing the alarm to be reset from the fire alarm control panel after the station has been closed.\n\nIn some places, particularly at college dormitories and schools, students set off fire alarms as a prank or simply because they want to (out of anger, curiosity or revenge). These false alarms can convey a risk to alarm fatigue if they occur repeatedly, causing occupants to dismiss the importance of alarms or ignore them completely. In areas where false alarms are a recurring problem, pull stations may be covered with a clear plastic cover (sold under the \"Stopper\" trade name) that will cause people to notice the person by sounding an alarm when tinkered with or opened, creating focus on the fire alarm. Because of these and other issues, setting off a fire alarm when there is no fire or other emergency is illegal in most jurisdictions.\n\nIn Europe, Australia, New Zealand, parts of Canada and Asia, pull stations are generally not used; instead a manual call point is used, which is usually referred to as an MCP, call point or Fire Point within the fire protection industry and as a \"transmitter\" in Japan. They are used to allow building occupants to signal that a fire or other emergency exists within the building. When activated they will raise a plastic flag out of the top to tell which alarm was activated. They are usually connected to a central fire alarm panel which is in turn connected to an alarm system in the building, and often to a local fire brigade dispatcher as well. The first modern MCP arrived in Europe in 1972 and was developed by KAC.\n\nManual call points are used to initiate an alarm signal, and operate by means of a simple button press or when glass is broken revealing a button. They can form part of a manual alarm system or an automatic alarm system. There will be an indicator on the monitoring unit for visual indication to locate the call point easily, and there should be a visual identifier of the unit which triggered the alarm, typically a mechanical flag which operates on a latch and must be manually reset, e.g. by a key.\n\nPreviously, the old British standard did not allow hinged covers and plastic resettable elements. Plastic elements must have the same printing as the EN 54 glass.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly common in the UK and Europe for wireless MCPs to be used in temporary environments such as construction sites. These typically provide the same level of protection as a standard wired fire alarm installation, but can be moved around as needed in the changing environment of a building under construction without the need for specialist electrician installation. They often combine call point functionality with sounder and strobe functions for ease of installation.\n\nSuch systems typically operate a similar structure to a standard wired fire alarm network, in that Manual Call Points may be mixed with automatic fire detection in the form of heat detection and smoke detection (often specially designed to be dust resistant, due to the increased likelihood of dust on a construction site) and can be connected to a monitoring base station unit. This unit provides visual identification of the triggering unit in any alarm, and should also be able to monitor radio signal strength (which may change as the build progresses) and battery life.\n\nDue to their use for life inherent purposes, radio receivers used in such systems should be of Category 1 standard.\n\nFire detection and alarm products placed on the market within the European Union must, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 305/2011, conform to the European harmonised technical standard EN 54 Fire Detection and Fire Alarm Systems.\n\nEN 54 part 11 is the section of the mandatory standard relating to manual call points.\n\nEuropean Committee for Standardization (CEN, French: Comité Européen de Normalisation) is responsible for the development and maintenance of the standard, as part of its remit for developing harmonisedEuropean standards for free movement of goods in the European Union countries.\n\nThe EN 54 certification of each device has to be issued annually, and for products of this nature must be issued by a notified body in accordance with the stringent testing procedures outlined within the standard.\n\nIf an EN 54 certificate is over one year old, it has expired and it is not a valid certificate.

It was once the largest ink manufacturer in the world.\n\nThe William Carter Company, the forerunner of Carter's Ink, was founded in 1858 by Boston stationer William Carter who, in order to supplement his paper sales, had started repackaging other companies' inks and selling them under his own name. In 1860, William Carter's brother, Edward Carter, joined the company and the firm became known as \"William Carter and Bro.\"\n\nThe Civil War disrupted Carter's primary ink supplier, so William Carter obtained the use of its formulas on a royalty basis and started making his own inks and mucilage, which necessitated the move to a larger building. Another brother, John H. Carter, joined the company, which became \"William Carter & Bros.\"\n\nIn 1865 William's cousin, John W. Carter, joined the enterprise and the name became \"Carter Bros. & Company.\" John W. Carter focused his efforts on the ink part of the business which, along with the sales efforts of James P. Dinsmore, resulted in such growth that the ink business was separated from the paper business and moved into its own quarters in 1868.\"\n\nThe entire firm and both of its divisions and their separate buildings were destroyed the night of November 9, 1872, in what has been called the Great Boston Fire of 1872. All that was left was the company's good will and its formulas.\n\nAfter the fire in 1872, John W. Carter teamed up with James P. Dinsmore to buy the ink division and start a new firm known as \"Carter, Dinsmore and Company.\" The new company thrived and by 1884 had become the largest ink producer in the world. Contributing to this growth was John W. Carter's belief in and commitment to research to develop new and better inks.\n\nJames P. Dinsmore retired in 1888, and John W. Carter drowned in 1895, which created an organizational crisis in the unincorporated enterprise, which led to its incorporation later that year as \"The Carter's Ink Company.\n\nAt the time of John W. Carter's death, his son, Richard B. Carter was still studying at Harvard, but after his graduation in 1898, he joined the company. After a period of learning the business, he became its head in 1903.\n\nUnder Richard Carter's leadership the company outgrew its Boston location. In 1909 a new factory was built in Cambridge and occupied in 1910. The building's huge \"Carter's Inks\" electric sign faced the Charles River and was an area landmark for many years. Richard Carter continued his father's commitment to research and development of inks, glues and related products.\n\nIn the 1920s, when upmarket writing pens were a popular luxury item, Carter began its range of pens. The line was discontinued in the early 1930s, but they are still fondly remembered and sought after by collectors.\n\nSamuel D. Wonders was elected president of the company in 1949 and served until 1955.\n\nFrancis J. Honn invented the highlighting marker (under the trademark Hi-Liter) as the Vice President of Technology at Carter's in 1963.\n\nIn 1975 the company was sold to Dennison Manufacturing Company, now Avery Dennison.\n\nSamuel D. Wonders was followed by Nathan C. Hubley, Jr who retired as President in 1976 when the company was sold to Dennison. To help with the transition, he remained with Dennison as Vice President until 1977.\n\nAfter acquiring Carter's Ink Company in 1975, Dennison made the business decision to discard all of Carter's records from the 1860s on, including all of Carter's meticulous ink research records. The Carter name is still used by Avery-Dennison on some ink-related products such as stamp pads. The Carter's Ink building in Cambridge still stands but has been adapted to other uses. In the summer of 1984, Thinking Machines Corporation moved its headquarters to the building, and signed a ten-year lease in 1989. In 2004, it was converted to include 130,000 square feet of lab space to accommodate acquisition by ViaCell, a cellular medicine research company later acquired by PerkinElmer.\n\n"}
{"id": "2321651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321651", "title": "Japanese values", "text": "Japanese values\n\nJapanese values are cultural assumptions and ideas particular to Japanese culture. The honne/tatemae divide between public expression and private thoughts/feelings is considered to be of paramount importance in Japanese culture. In Japanese mythology, the gods display human emotions, such as love and anger. In these stories, behavior that results in positive relations with others is rewarded, and empathy, identifying oneself with another, is highly valued. By contrast, those actions that are individualistic or antisocial (those that harm others) are condemned. Hurtful behavior is punished in the myths by ostracizing the offender.\n\nNo society can exist that does not manage and integrate antisocial behavior, Japanese children learn from their earliest days that human fulfillment comes from close association with others. Children learn early to recognize that they are part of an interdependent society, beginning in the family and later extending to larger groups such as neighborhood, school, playground, community, and company. Dependence on others is a natural part of the human condition; it is viewed negatively only when the social obligations (giri) it creates are too onerous to fulfill, leading to, for example, suicide, which is a topic of great elaboration in Japanese history and culture. However, in the early part of the 21st century, school bullying has become a topic of very great concern.\n\nIn interpersonal relationships, most Japanese tend to avoid open competition and confrontation. Working with others requires self-control, but it carries the rewards of pride in contributing to the group, emotional security, and social identity. Wa (), the notion of harmony within a group, requires an attitude of cooperation and a recognition of social roles. If each individual in the group understands personal obligations and empathizes with the situations of others, then the group as a whole benefit. Success can come only if all put forth their best individual efforts. Decisions are often made only after consulting with everyone in the group. Consensus does not imply that there has been universal agreement, but this style of consultative decision-making involves each member of the group in information exchange, reinforces feelings of group identity, and makes implementation of the decision smoother. Cooperation within a group also is often focused on competition between that group and a parallel one, whether the issue is one of educational success or market share. Symbols such as uniforms, names, banners, and songs identify the group as distinct from others both to outsiders and to those within the group. Participation in group activities, whether official or unofficial, is a symbolic statement that an individual wishes to be considered part of the group. Thus, after-work bar hopping provides not only instrumental opportunities for the exchange of information and release of social tensions but also opportunities to express nonverbally a desire for continued affiliation.\n\nWorking in a group in Japan requires the development of successful channels of communication, which reinforce group interdependence, and the sense of difference from those who are not members of the group. Yet social interaction beyond that which occurs with individuals with whom one lives and works is a necessity in contemporary society. If the exchange is brief and relatively insignificant, such as buying a newspaper, anonymity will be maintained. But if the relationship is expected to continue over a long period, whether in business, marriage, employment, or neighborhood, great care is likely to be invested in establishing and maintaining good relationships. Such relationships are often begun by using the social networks of a relative, friend, or colleague who can provide an introduction to the desired person or serve as . The nakoudo most often refers to the person (or people) who negotiates marriage arrangements, including checking each family's background, conveying questions and criticisms, and smoothing out difficulties. But this kind of personal mediation is common in many aspects of Japanese life.\n\n\n - Library of Congress Country Studies.\n\n"}

She founded the party All India Trinamool Congress (AITC or TMC) in 1998 after separating from the Indian National Congress, and became its chairperson. She is often referred to as Didi (meaning: \"elder sister\" in Hindi and Bengali).\n\nBanerjee has previously served twice as the Minister of Railways, the first woman to do so. She is also the first female Minister of Coal, and Minister of State for Human Resource Development, Youth Affairs, Sports, Women and Child Development in the cabinet of the Indian government. She rose to prominence after opposing the erstwhile land acquisition policies for industrialisation of the Communist government in West Bengal for Special Economic Zones at the cost of agriculturalists and farmers at Singur. In 2011 Banerjee pulled off a landslide victory for the AITC alliance in West Bengal, defeating the 34-year-old Communist Party of India (Marxist)- led Left Front government, the world's longest-serving democratically elected communist government in the process.\n\nBanerjee was born in Kolkata (formerly called Calcutta) West Bengal to a Bengali Hindu family. Her parents were Promileswar Banerjee and Gayetri Devi. Banerjee's father, Promileswar died due to lack of medical treatment, when she was 17. She identifies herself as a Hindu.\n\nIn 1970, Banerjee completed the higher secondary board examination from Deshbandhu Sishu Sikshalay. She did her Bachelor's in History from the Jogamaya Devi College. Later she earned her master's degree in Islamic history from the University of Calcutta. This was followed by a degree in Education from the Shri Shikshayatan College and a Law degree from the Jogesh Chandra Chaudhuri Law College, Kolkata. She also received an honorary doctorate from Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneswar. She was also honoured with a Doctorate of Literature (D.Litt.) degree by the Calcutta University.\n\nBanerjee became involved with politics when she was only 15. While studying at the Jogamaya Devi College she established Chhatra Parishad Unions, the student's wing of the Congress (I) Party, defeating the All India Democratic Students Organisation affiliated with the Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist). She continued in Congress (I) Party in West Bengal serving a variety of positions within the party and in other local political organisations.\n\nBanerjee began her political career in the Congress party as a young woman in the 1970s She quickly rose in the ranks of the local Congress group, and remained the general secretary of Mahila Congress (I), West Bengal, from 1976 to 1980. In the 1984 general election, Banerjee became one of India's youngest parliamentarians ever, defeating veteran Communist politician Somnath Chatterjee, to win the Jadavpur parliamentary Constituency in West Bengal. She also became the general secretary of the Indian Youth Congress. Losing her seat in the 1989 general elections in an anti-Congress wave, she was re-elected in the 1991 general elections, having settled into the Calcutta South constituency. She retained the Kolkata South seat in the 1996, 1998, 1999, 2004 and 2009 general elections.\n\nBanerjee was appointed the Union Minister of State for Human Resources Development, Youth Affairs and Sports, and Women and Child Development in 1991 by prime minister P. V. Narasimha Rao. As the sports minister, she announced that she would resign, and protested in a rally at the Brigade Parade Ground in Kolkata, against the Government's indifference towards her proposal to improve sports in the country. She was discharged of her portfolios in 1993. In April 1996, she alleged that Congress was behaving as a stooge of the CPI-M in West Bengal. She claimed that she was the lone voice of reason and wanted a \"clean Congress\".\n\nIn 1997, Banerjee left the Congress Party in West Bengal and became one of the founding members of the All India Trinamool Congress along with Mukul Roy. It quickly became the primary opposition party to the long-standing Communist government in the state. On 11 December 1998, she controversially held a Samajwadi Party MP, Daroga Prasad Saroj, by the collar and dragged him out of the well of the Lok Sabha to prevent him from protesting against the Women's Reservation Bill.\n\nIn 1999, she joined the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government and was allocated the Railways Ministry.\n\nIn 2000, Banerjee presented her first Railway Budget. In it she fulfilled many of her promises to her home state West Bengal. She introduced a new biweekly New Delhi-Sealdah Rajdhani Express train and four express trains connecting various parts of West Bengal, namely the Howrah-Purulia Rupasi Bangla Express, Sealdah-New Jalpaiguri Padatik Express, Shalimar-Adra Aranyak Express, Sealdah-Ajmer Ananya Superfast Express and the Sealdah-Amritsar Akal Takht Superfast Express. She also increased the frequency of the Pune-Howrah Azad Hind Express and the extension of at least three express train services. Work on the Digha-Howrah Express service was also hastened during her brief tenure.\n\nShe also focused on developing tourism, enabling the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway section to obtain two additional locomotives and proposing the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited. She also commented that India should play a pivotal role in the Trans-Asian Railway and that rail links between Bangladesh and Nepal would be reintroduced. In all, she introduced 19 new trains for the 2000–2001 fiscal year.\n\nIn 2000, she and Ajit Kumar Panja resigned to protest the hike in petroleum prices, and then withdrew their resignations without providing any reasons.\n\nIn early 2001, after \"Tehelka\"'s exposure of Operation West End, Banerjee walked out of the NDA cabinet and allied with the Congress Party for West Bengal's 2001 elections, to protest the corruption charges levelled by the website against senior ministers of the government.\n\nShe returned to the NDA government in January 2004, and held the Coal and Mines portfolios till the Indian general election of 20 May 2004, in which she was the only Trinamool Congress member to win a Parliamentary seat from West Bengal.\n\nOn 20 October 2005, she protested against the forceful land acquisition and the atrocities perpetrated against local farmers in the name of the industrial development policy of the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government in West Bengal. Benny Santoso, CEO of the Indonesia-based Salim Group had pledged a large investment in West Bengal, and the West Bengal government had given him farmland in Howrah, sparking protests. In soaking rain, Banerjee and other Trinamool Congress members stood in front of the Taj Hotel where Santoso had arrived, shut out by the police. Later, she and her supporters followed Santoso's convoy. A planned \"black flag\" protest was avoided, when the government had Santoso arrive three hours ahead of schedule.\n\nBanerjee suffered further setbacks in 2005 when her party lost control of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation and the sitting mayor defected from her party. In 2006, the Trinamool Congress was defeated in West Bengal's Assembly Elections, losing more than half of its sitting members.\n\nOn 4 August 2006, Banerjee hurled her resignation papers at the deputy speaker Charanjit Singh Atwal in Lok Sabha. She was provoked by Speaker Somnath Chatterjee's rejection of her adjournment motion on illegal infiltration by Bangladeshis in West Bengal on the grounds that it was not in the proper format.\n\nIn November 2006, Banerjee was forcibly stopped on her way to Singur for a rally against a proposed Tata Motors car project. Banerjee reached the West Bengal assembly and protested at the venue. She addressed a press conference at the assembly and announced a 12-hour shutdown by her party on Friday. The Trinamool Congress MLAs protested by damaging furniture and microphones in the West Bengal Assembly. A major strike was called on 14 December 2006.\nBefore the 2009 parliamentary elections she forged an alliance with the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) led by Indian National Congress. The alliance won 26 seats. Banerjee joined the central cabinet as the railway minister (second tenure). In the 2010 Municipal Elections in West Bengal, TMC won Kolkata Municipal Corporation by a margin of 62 seats. TMC also won Bidhan Nagar Corporation by a seven-seat margin. In 2011, Banerjee won a sweeping majority and assumed the position of chief minister of the state of West Bengal. Her party ended the 34-year rule of the Left Front.\n\nTMC threatened to withdraw support from UPA in protest at the government's decision to allow foreign direct investment (FDI) in retail markets, and also against a hike of petrol diesel prices and gave a deadline of 72 hours to withdraw the reforms. On 18 September 2012, Banarjee declared her party had withdrawn support from the UPA and ran independently. The TMC's minister submitted her resignation on 21 September 2012.\n\nThe Nandigram violence was an incident in Nandigram, West Bengal where, a battalion of armed police stormed the rural area in the district of Purba Medinipur with the aim of quashing protests against the West Bengal government's plans to expropriate of land for a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) to be developed by the Indonesian-based Salim Group. At least 14 villagers were shot dead and 70 more were wounded. This led to a large number of intellectuals to protest on the streets..\n\nBanerjee wrote letters to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Union Home Minister Shivraj Patil to stop what she called \"state sponsored violence\" promoted by CPI(M) in Nandigram. Her political activism during the movement is widely believed to be one of the contributing causes to her landslide victory in 2011.\n\nThe CBI report on the incident clearly vindicated CPI(M)'s stand that Buddhadeb did not order the police to open fire. They did so only to disperse the unlawful assembly after every other standard operating procedure had failed.\n\nTrinamool Congress performed well in the 2009 parliamentary election, winning 19 seats. Its allies in congress and SUCI also won six and one seat respectively marking the best performance by any opposition party in West Bengal since the beginning of the Left's regime. Until then, the Congress victory of 16 seats in 1984, was considered their best show in opposition.\n\nIn 2009, Mamata Banerjee became the railway minister for the second time. Her focus was again on West Bengal.\n\nShe led Indian Railways to introduce a number of non-stop \"Duronto Express\" trains connecting large cities as well as a number of other passenger trains, including women-only trains. The Anantnag-Qadigund segment of the Jammu–Baramulla line that had been in the making since 1994 was inaugurated during her tenure. She also declared the long line-1 of the Kolkata Metro as an independent zone of the Indian Railways for which she was criticised.\n\nShe stepped down as railway minister to become the chief minister of West Bengal. She commented: \"The way I am leaving the railways behind, it will run well. Don’t worry, my successor will get all my support.\" Her nominee from her party, Dinesh Trivedi, succeeded her as railway minister.\n\nBanerjee's tenure as railway minister was subsequently questioned as most of the big-ticket announcements made by her when she held the post, saw little or no progress. Reuters reported that \"Her two-year record as railway minister has been heavily criticized for running the network into more debt to pay for populist measures such as more passenger trains.\" The Indian Railways became loss-making during her two-year tenure.\n\nIn 2011, the All India Trinamool Congress along with SUCI and the INC won the West Bengal legislative assembly election against the incumbent Left Alliance by securing 227 seats. TMC won 184 seats with the INC winning 42 seats and the SUCI secured one seat. This marked the end of the longest ruling democratically elected Communist party in the world.\nBanerjee was sworn in as chief minister of West Bengal on 20 May 2011. As the first female chief minister of West Bengal, one of her first decisions was to return 400 acres of land to Singur farmers. \"The cabinet has decided to return 400 acres to unwilling farmers in Singur,\" the chief minister said. \"I have instructed the department to prepare the papers for this. If Tata-babu (Ratan Tata) wants, he can set up his factory on the remaining 600 acres, otherwise we will see how to go about it.\"\n\nShe has also been credited for setting up of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration.\n\nShe began various reforms in the education and health sectors. Some of the reforms in the education sector included the release of teachers' monthly pay on the first of every month and quicker pensions for retiring teachers. In the health sector Banerjee promised: \"A three-phase developmental system will be taken up to improve the heath infrastructure and service.\" On 30 April 2015, a representative of UNICEF India congratulated the government for making Nadia the first Open Defecation Free district in the country. In a statement on 17 October 2012, Banerjee attributed the increasing incidence of rape in the country to \"more free interaction between men and women\". She said that \"Earlier if men and women would hold hands, they would get caught by parents and reprimanded but now everything is so open. It’s like an open market with open options.\" She was criticised in the national media for these statements.\n\nShe was also instrumental in the rollback of the petrol price hikes and the suspension of FDI in the retail sector until a consensus is evolved. In a bid to improve the law and enforcement situation in West Bengal, police commissionerates were created at Howrah, Barrackpore, Durgapur-Asansol and Bidhannagar. The total area of Kolkata Municipal Corporation has been brought under the control of the Kolkata Police.\nBanerjee had shown a keen interest in making the public aware of the state's history and culture. She named several stations of the Kolkata Metro after freedom fighters, and plans on naming upcoming stations after religious leaders, poets, singers and the like. Mamata Banerjee has been criticised for starting controversial stipends to imams (Iman Bhatta) which was ruled unconstitutional by Calcutta High Court.\nOn 16 February 2012, Bill Gates, of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, sent a letter to the West Bengal government praising Banerjee and her administration for achieving a full year without any reported cases of polio. The letter said this was not only a milestone for India but also for the whole world.\n\nIn June 2012, she launched a Facebook page to rally and gather public support for A.P.J Abdul Kalam, her party's choice for the presidential elections. After he refused to stand for the second time, she supported Pranab Mukherjee for the post, after a long tussle over the issue, commenting she was personally a \"great fan\" of Mukherjee and wishing that he \"grows from strength to strength\".\n\nShe is against calling \"bandhs\" (work stoppage) although actively supported them when she was in opposition.\n\nHer tenure was also heavily marred by the Saradha Scam - a financial embezzlement which led to the imprisonment of Madan Mitra - a former minister in her cabinet, Kunal Ghosh-a party MP, and rigorous grilling of several party men holding important posts.\n\n2016 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election was held for 294 seats (out of 295 seats) of the Vidhan Sabha in the state of West Bengal in India. All India Trinamool Congress won the elections with a landslide two-third majority under Mamata Banerjee winning 211 seats out of total 293, who has been elected as Chief Minister West Bengal for the second term. All India Trinamool Congress won with an enhanced majority contesting alone and became the first ruling party to win without an ally since 1962 in West Bengal.\n\nThe Saradha Group financial scandal and the Rose Valley financial scandal came to light during her tenure and some of her cabinet ministers were accused of money laundering and have been incarcerated. One of her paintings was also sold to Sudipto Sen (central figure in the Saradha scam) for ₹1.8crore, while 20 more of her pictures were seized from other Saradha Group shareholders. She has been criticised by opposition parties for not taking adequate steps against her own ministers who tried to cover-up their deeds.\n\nThe Narada sting operation was carried out by Mathew Samuel in 2011 for the Indian newsmagazine \"Tehelka\" and published on Naradanews.com just before the 2016 West Bengal Assembly elections. The sting targeted high-ranking officials and politicians of Banerjee's political party All India Trinamool Congress (AITC).\n\nDuring her tenure she challenged the federal system of India when she ordered the arrest of CBI officials, who arrived in Kolkata to investigate the Saradha Group financial scandal.\n\nMamata Banerjee has been criticised for starting controversial stipends to imams (Iman Bhatta). which was ruled unconstitutional by Calcutta High Court and ordered the West Bengal government to stop payment of a monthly stipend to thousands of imams and muezzins in the state.\n\nIn October 2016, the West Bengal government banned the Durga Puja festival immersion after 4:00 pm. Durga Puja was to take place on 12 October and Muharram on 13 October. This was seen by a section of the West Bengal population as another example of the \"\"Muslim Appeasement\"\" policy of Banerjee's government. The Calcutta High Court overturned the decision and called it \"\"a bid to appease minorities\"\".\n\nAccording to Mayukh Biswas, a leftist student leader, Mamata Banerjee denied permission for Anti-CAA rallies and badly suppressed campus democracy in West Bengal.\n\nBanerjee and her government was widely criticised of the handling of the Coronavirus pandemic and was accused of concealing facts by the opposition, critics and many doctors.\n\nThe opposition accused Mamata of playing \"appeasement politics\" amid the Covid-19 crisis. On 1 April, Banerjee claimed that the West Bengal Government have already traced 54 people who attended the Tablighi Jamaat religious gathering during the COVID19 Outbreak, and 44 of them are foreigners. Although according to a report by central security agencies, 232 people had attended the Delhi's Tablighi Jamaat event from West Bengal. Of this, 123 are Indian nationals and 109 are foreigners.\n\nThe West Bengal Government has been also criticised for not sending enough samples to the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases(NICED) for testing. The government later banned use of cellphones in hospitals.\n\nThroughout her political life, Banerjee has maintained a publicly austere lifestyle, dressing in simple traditional Bengali clothes and avoiding luxuries.\nIn an interview in April 2019, Prime minister Narendra Modi claimed that despite their political differences, Banerjee sends her own selected \"kurtas\" and sweets to him every year.\n\nBanerjee is a self-taught painter and a poet. Her 300 paintings were sold for ₹9crore (₹90 million, £990,000 or US$1,350,000).\n\nIn 2012, \"Time\" magazine named her as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World. \"Bloomberg Markets\" magazine listed her among the 50 most influential people in the world of finance in September 2012.

He is best known for his role in the Dreyfus Affair.\n\nPicquart was born in Strasbourg. He began his military career in 1872, graduating from the \"Ecole Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr\" as fifth in his year. Picquart served as an infantry officer in France before seeing service in Indochina. He subsequently studied at the General Staff Academy (\"l'école d'État-major\") where he was second in his class, after which he became a lecturer at the War Academy (\"l'École supérieure de guerre\"). One of his students at the latter institute was Alfred Dreyfus.\n\nPicquart was then appointed to the General Staff in Paris. As a staff officer he acted as reporter of the debates in the first Dreyfus Court-martial for the then Minister of War and the Chief of the General Staff. Picquart was subsequently promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel on 6 April 1896. He was appointed chief of the army's intelligence section (\"Deuxième Bureau, service de renseignement militaire\") in 1895. The following year Picquart discovered that the memorandum \"(\"bordereau\")\" used to convict Captain Alfred Dreyfus, had actually been the work of Major Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy. Several high-ranking generals warned Colonel Picquart to conceal his discovery, but Picquart persisted and continued his investigation. In this he was hindered and sabotaged by subordinate officers, notably Major Henry. As a consequence, Picquart was relieved of duty with the Deuxième Bureau and sent (December 1896) to regimental duty, commanding the 4th Regiment of Tirailleurs (native infantry) based at Sousse in French Tunisia.\nAfter the trial of Émile Zola for publishing his 1898 open letter \"J'Accuse…!\", Picquart was himself accused of forging the note that had convinced him of Esterhazy's guilt. He was then arrested for forgery and was waiting for a Court-martial, while the French Court of Cassation was reviewing the Dreyfus case. After the second Court-martial, held as a consequence of the conclusions of the court, Picquart resigned from the army. However, the exoneration of Dreyfus in 1906 also absolved Picquart, who was, by an act of the Chamber of Deputies, promoted to brigadier-general. That was the rank that an officer of his seniority and experience could normally have expected to reach, if his career had not been interrupted by his involvement in the Dreyfus affair.\n\nIn 1906, General Picquart entered Georges Clemenceau's first cabinet as Minister of War. He held that position for the entire duration of the Clemenceau Cabinet, from 25 October 1906 to 24 July 1909. Picquart then returned to military service as an Army Corps commander.\n\nA keen amateur pianist, Picquart was a regular visitor to the Chaigneau family, whose daughters formed the Trio Chaigneau. He later helped arrange concerts for them.\n\nWhile still a serving army officer, Picquart died on 19 January 1914 in Amiens from injuries sustained in a fall from a horse. He was 59.\n\n\n\n"}

The National Parks Board of Trustees proclaimed a area for the zebra's preservation. The mountain zebra population of the park comprised only five stallions and one mare and was insufficient to expand the population. By 1950 only two stallions remained, and a neighboring farmer, Mr H L Lombard, improved the breeding pool by donating eleven zebra to the park.\n\nBy 1964, there were only 25 zebra in the park. At this time, the park's size was increased to and Paul Michau donated six zebra to the park. From then on, the number of zebras increased steadily to about 140. In 1975, the zebras were re-introduced to the Western Cape at the De Hoop Nature Reserve.\n\nSince 1978, capture and relocation of mountain zebra to new habitat have been part of the routine management of the park. Currently (2015) the park's herd number over 700 animals, and an average of about 20 animals are relocated each year.

{"id": "2321679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321679", "title": "Amateur Gardening (magazine)", "text": "Amateur Gardening (magazine)\n\nAmateur Gardening is a British weekly magazine dedicated to gardening. It includes news, advice, feature articles, and celebrity columns and interviews.\n\n\"Amateur Gardening\" was founded in London in May 1884 by Shirley Hibberd, who edited it until 1887. This makes it the oldest UK amateur gardening weekly still published today, and was Britain's bestseller in that category in 2013. The magazine is published on a weekly basis. Its editorial offices are in Farnborough, Hampshire.\n\nAt the time of the magazine's launch in 1884 there had been several other notable gardening magazines in circulation, including the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\" and \"Gardens Illustrated\", but these were tailored more for the professional gardener. \"Amateur Gardening\" is regarded as the first paper designed specifically for the amateur.\n\nThe founders were two brothers – W. H. and L. Collingridge – who also produced other periodicals of the time, including the well known \"City Press\".\n\nThe first issue of \"Amateur Gardening\" consisted of just 16 pages, 12 of which were devoted to editorial matter. The first editor, Shirley Hibberd, was a botanist and an academic authority on gardening. He steered the magazine down a rocky road, with articles that were considered by many to be rather too technical. He stayed in the job for just two years.\n\nThe man who really established \"Amateur Gardening\" was T. W. Sanders, who was to remain editor for 40 years. Sanders knew exactly what the new generation of amateur gardeners wanted, and his style of editing attracted a wide audience. Prior to the First World War a circulation of 100,000 copies per week had been achieved, but this fell off considerably during the conflict. It was not until the mid-1920s that the magazine's circulation rose again to a healthy level.\n\nSanders also wrote a large number of books, the most important of which was \"Sanders' Encyclopaedia of Gardening\". It was the \"bible\" for several generations of gardeners, and is consulted even today.\n\nIn 1926, the magazine suffered a severe blow when Sanders died. However, the assistant editor, A. J. Macself, was able to take over as editor and he successfully steered the magazine through another 20 years – and probably the most turbulent period in its history.\n\nIn 1934 Macself presided over the title's 50th birthday party, celebrating in grand style with a dinner for more than 300 people in the New Connaught Rooms in London's Mayfair. The guest list included Lord Aberconway, the then President of the Royal Horticultural Society, Sir Austen Chamberlain (a former Chancellor of the Exchequer) and Lord Riddell (a director of the Collingridge publishing firm, and a personal friend of former Prime Minister David Lloyd George).\n\nIn June 1940 the magazine left its offices in the City, and moved to the Country Life Building in Covent Garden.\n\nMacself was a member of the original Hardy Plant Society and a renowned expert in ferns. Arguably he was even more prolific as a writer than Sanders. Between 1933 and 1939 he launched a series of gift books, as well as an annual and a calendar, besides writing numerous ordinary gardening books.\n\nHe carried on editing through World War II, even though paper restrictions had dramatically limited the size of the magazine. During this period \"Amateur Gardening\" put its full weight behind the national Dig for Victory campaign, which encouraged everyone to grow their own fruits and vegetables.\n\nWhen Macself retired in 1946, he was succeeded by Arthur Hellyer, hitherto the assistant editor. Hellyer had joined the magazine in 1929, and was charming, knowledgeable and hardworking. He retired in 1967. During his years as editor he also contributed weekly to the \"Financial Times\" and regularly to \"Country Life\" and many other publications – and he wrote innumerable books.\n\nHellyer took over at a great time on the magazine's history. Paper restrictions were lifted during the 1950s and 1960s, and the magazine enjoyed a boom, the like of which had never been seen before or since. Circulation rose to a staggering 300,000 copies per week, and issues regularly contained some 124 pages. Remarkably, by 1967 when Hellyer retired, the magazine had been in business for 83 years, but had only seen four editors (and one of them lasted just two years).\n\nFor the first hundred years of the magazine's life it seemed to be the norm that when an editor stopped, his role was taken over by the assistant editor. This happened again when Hellyer retired, as his assistant, Anthony Huxley, took on the role.\n\nHe was the son of the writer Julian Huxley, and a nephew of the philosopher and writer Aldous Huxley, who wrote \"Brave New World\" in 1932. Anthony was also the great-grandson of Thomas Henry Huxley, a renowned biologist who defended Darwin's theory of evolution when it was receiving considerable criticism.\n\nHuxley was a keen and knowledgeable plantsman, and although he was very supportive of amateurs generally, he was more interested in botanical integrity and ecology, particularly in the cultivation of house plants. He introduced the use of bottle gardens to the UK, and in 1956 exhibited the first ever bottle garden at the Chelsea Flower Show. He was editor for just four years; in 1971 he left to devote his time to book writing and freelance journalism.\n\nThe post of editor was then taken over by assistant editor Peter Wood, who had been a student at the RHS garden at Wisley in the early 1950s, and had come to \"Amateur Gardening\" straight after his diploma course finished. He started off in the department helping to answer the thousands of readers' queries that arrived by post each year. During his editorship, Wood steered the magazine through the technological revolution (the introduction of computers), as well as the turbulent periods of industrial unrest in the 1970s. There were several times when \"Amateur Gardening\" was printed with blank white pages, because the printers refused to deal with pages that had been written by, or contained pictures from, people who were not members of certain unions.\n\nWood also presided over the magazine's centenary celebrations in 1984. With garden designer Roger Sweetinburgh, he drew up the plans for a Victorian garden at the Chelsea Flower Show – and won a Gold Medal.\n\nAnd there was also a centenary lunch at RHS Wisley Garden, with a ceremonial tree planting. It was a much lower-key event than the 50th birthday celebrations, but this was now the recession-hit Thatcher era. Budgets for big parties were much tighter.\n\nIn 1979, Wood was instrumental in moving the magazine out of London and down to Poole in Dorset.\n\nWood retired from the magazine in 1985, and was replaced by Jack Kendall, a journalist who worked on \"Practical Householder\" (a sister magazine to \"Amateur Gardening\"). He was not an experienced gardener, but was a good organiser and writer. Shortly after he started, Kendall was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and he died just 10 months later.\n\nFor much of the time Kendall was being treated for cancer, the magazine's deputy, Graham Clarke, had been acting editor, and upon Kendall's death he was appointed editor. Clarke had been born into horticulture as his father had been a Superintendent (today known as a Manager) of Regent's Park in the centre of London. For all of Clarke's childhood he had lived in a lodge within the Queen Mary Rose Garden. When a teenager, he and his family moved to Hyde Park, London's most famous open space. After completing school he studied horticulture at the Royal Horticultural Society's Wisley Garden in Surrey. Theory and practical qualifications lead him to a year working in the garden at Buckingham Palace, following by a stint working in the commercial glasshouse nursery for the Central Royal Parks. In 1976 he moved into journalism, joining \"Amateur Gardening\" as a trainee sub-editor. He rose through the ranks, and took over as editor in 1986.\n\nDuring Clarke's 11-year tenure as editor, he also launched a monthly version of \"Amateur Gardening\" (which was called \"Your Garden\"), and Clarke became group editor (over this and \"The Gardener\", another monthly magazine which had been bought from one of the companies that had suffered under the hands of publisher Robert Maxwell).\n\nIn 1997 Clarke took on a more business-oriented role at the magazine. The National Amateur Gardening Show, which was held annually between 1996 and 2008, was an idea conceived by Clarke, along with the magazine's then marketing manager Robyn Perrin. The Show was a partnership with the Royal Bath and West Showground, Shepton Mallet, and was held annually in September. After the magazine withdrew from the Show in 2008, it continued for a further four years and was held for the last time in 2012.\n\nIn 1997, to mark the forthcoming Millennium, Clarke launched the Allotments 2000 campaign, which called for – and achieved – a Parliamentary Inquiry into the future of allotment gardening. Clarke and deputy editor Adrian Bishop both gave evidence at the Inquiry into the current state of allotments in the UK. The Allotments 2000 campaign later won Clarke and Bishop the Campaign of the Year award from the Periodical Publishers Association (PPA).\n\nWhen Clarke moved from the editor's chair in 1997, the editorship passed on to Bishop. He had been a journalist for local newspapers, and under his leadership \"Amateur Gardening\" enjoyed tighter news coverage of gardening matters, and a more celebrity-based style. In 2001 he was promoted simultaneously to editor-in-chief and publisher, which lead the way for the current deputy editor to move up, and Tim Rumball took over the reins. \nUnder Rumball the magazine overtook many of its long-standing rivals, and consolidated its position as the leading general gardening magazine on the news stands. As editor he has been a guest a number of times on BBC's \"Gardeners' Question Time\", and has appeared on TV many times. He instigated (and presented) the first \"Amateur Gardening\" DVD.\n\nIn 2017 the parent company, Time Inc (UK) Ltd, decided to move the magazine from its south coast-based office in Poole, to the company's headquarters at Farnborough in Hampshire. At the same time, Rumball decided it was time to retire. He was replaced by Garry Coward-Williams, who had been Rumball's Group Editor. Coward-Williams had been steering much of the editorial content and presentation for several years, and now as Editor he is able to mould the magazine so that it can compete effectively in a difficult market (for all printed magazines, owing to online content being readily available).\n\nThe list of editors since the magazine's launch are as follows: Shirley Hibberd (1884–1886), T. W. Sanders (1886–1926), A. J. Macself (1926–1946), Arthur Hellyer (1946–1967), Anthony Huxley (1967–1971), Peter Wood (1971–1985), Jack Kendall (1985–1986), Graham Clarke (1986–1997), Adrian Bishop (1997–2001), Tim Rumball (2001–2017) and Garry Coward-Williams (since 2017). Notable writers for the magazine have included Alan Titchmarsh, who also served as deputy editor, Monty Don, Charlie Dimmock, Bob Flowerdew, Anne Swithinbank, Percy Thrower and Peter Seabrook. The cottage gardener Margery Fish was a columnist for the magazine in the 1950s.\n\nIn the 1930s the original owners of \"Amateur Gardening\", the Collingridge company, sold the business to the larger Newnes and Pearson publishing group. In the 1960s, this company merged with Odhams, a publisher famous for its newspapers and magazines. Eventually, The Mirror Group acquired Odhams, which resulted in one large company with many dozens of magazines under its belt. It relaunched itself as the International Publishing Corporation, better known as IPC. In 2013 the IPC name disappeared when its owner, US-based Time Inc, renamed it Time Inc (UK) Ltd.\n\nIn 2018 Time Inc (UK) Ltd became TI Media.\n\n"}

Manning is horrified and ends up killing Canelli, then giving up himself and the others to police.\n\n\n\"The New York Times\" gave the film a positive review, writing, \"...it's good to have a reminder that Hollywood still holds top priority in the gangster melodrama field. Take \"Black Tuesday\", which accompanied the Palace's new stage bill yesterday, with Edward G. Robinson playing his old, snariing, savage self. We hastily add that this medium-budget United Artists offering, produced by Robert Goldstein, by no means reprises the sterling tradition of those cops-and-killers yarns about our urban jungles of the roaring Twenties, when the Robinsons, Cagneys and Munis cut their fangs. However, purely on a surface level, the new entry can snuggle up to them quite respectably ... In contrast to Mr. Robinson's wholesale sputtering, the supporting cast of comparatively unfamiliar faces are brought, one by one, into impersonal but perceptive focus. And most of them shine convincingly.\"\n\nFilm historian and critic Alain Silver said of the film, \"When society at large is threatened, the psychopaths presented tend to be of the most violent ilk, as if to justify social repression by exaggerating the threat. Edward G. Robinson as gangster Vincent Canelli in Black Tuesday... exhibits a sadistic bent rivaled only by James Cagney in \"White Heat\".\"\n\n"}

Sweeney, a former priest in the Diocese of Greenburg, pleaded guilty to molesting a 4th grade boy at some point between September 1991 and June 1992. Immediately following Sweeney's plea, the Diocese of Greensburg made a statement pledging future cooperation. In the statement, which was reported by Crux on August 4, the Diocese of Greensburg agreed to continue educating \"both children and adults in parishes and schools of the Diocese of Greensburg on how to spot and report suspected abuse.\" The Diocese also agreed to recommend reporting incidents of sexual abuse to the PA ChildLine and report any alleged incident of sexual abuse to \"PA Childline and the appropriate district attorney.\"\n\nOn August 9, 2018, Greensburg Bishop Edward Malesic issued an apology on behalf the Diocese, acknowledged there were numerous reports of sex abuse of children between the 1950s and 1980s, and announced that the Diocese would release the names of the accused clergy when the grand jury report is published.

It is north-west of the county town of Northallerton.\n\nThe village is mentioned in the \"Domesday Book\" as Cattun. The head of the manor is noted as \"Gilling\" and lands before the Norman conquest belonged to \"Earl Edwin\" and \"Ulf\". After 1086 the lands were granted to Count Alan of Brittany, with a small allocation to \"Godric, the steward\" and an unnamed individual. The manor became a mesne lordship and was granted to \"Adam de Mounchesny\" during the reign of Henry III. This passed to the \"Fitz Alan\" family around 1260 until the early 15th century when they were the possession of John Brough. His direct line of inheritance ceased around 1558 with the death of Sir Ralph Bulmer. Thereafter the descent followed that of the other Cowton manors nearby. The last confirmed lord of the manor was the Earl of Tyrconnel and thence possibly his cousin Walter Cecil Talbot.\n\nThe etymology of the village name is a combination of the Old English words of \"cū\" and tūn meaning \"Cow farm\". The East is to distinguish it from other Cowtons in the area. The village was previously known as \"Long Cowton\" and before that \"Magna Cowton\".\n\nOn 22 August 1138 the English armies defeated the Scottish at nearby Cowton Moor in the Battle of the Standard. The fields behind Holywell Lane are perhaps the burial grounds for the Scottish; the medieval name for the area was \"Scotch Graves\". The name of a local public footpath called Cramble Cross is thought to derive from a cross marking the last stand of the Scottish soldiers. Nearly two centuries later, the Scottish had their revenge on North Cowton, raiding it regularly in the early 14th century and burning it to the ground in 1318.\n\nThe disbanded Eryholme-Richmond branch line passed nearby with a former railway station at Moulton End, around ¼ of a mile from North Cowton. The line was opened in 1846 by the York and Newcastle Railway Company. At one time 13 trains a day passed through Moulton End railway station in each direction. The line was closed in 1969. The old station house, station cottage and railway bridge are Grade II listed buildings.\n\nThe nearest settlements to North Cowton are East Cowton, Uckerby, Scorton, Birkby and Dalton-on-Tees which are within of the village. The highest point in the village is at the north on Holywell Lane, at . The Stell has its source to the south of the village and is a tributary of the nearby River Wiske. The east end of the village lies close to the B1263 road.\n\nThe village lies within the Richmond UK Parliament constituency, the Richmondshire North electoral division of North Yorkshire County Council and the Croft ward of Hambleton District Council.\n\nAccording to the 2001 UK Census, the parish was 50.4% male and 49.6% female of the total population of 550. The religious make-up was 84.5% Christian with the rest stating no religion. The ethnic distribution was 100% White. There were 216 dwellings.\n\nAccording to the 2011 UK Census, the parish had a total population of 503 with 50.3% male and 49.7% female. The religious make-up was 68.4% Christian with the rest stating no religion. The ethnic distribution was 99.8% White with a small Mixed Ethnic minority. There were 223 dwellings.\n\nThe local school is North and South Cowton Community Primary School which has around 40 pupils split between two sites. It is within the catchment area of Richmond School and Sixth Form College for secondary education, to the age of eighteen.\n\nThe village public house is the Blacksmiths Arms. There is also a village hall, football pitch, children's playground, bus stop, war memorial, public telephone box and a postbox. A petrol station/shop is just outside the village on the B1263 road. The village is served by a bus service which runs between Darlington and Northallerton.\n\nThere are a number of public footpaths and bridleways, including Cramble Cross.\n\nThere are two churches, St Luke's Church of England and the Methodist Chapel. The chapel was built in 1827 and restored in 1881. St Luke's was built as a pastoral centre in 1968 and consecrated as the parish church on 21 October 1990.\n\n"}

Through Northamptonshire it bypasses the towns of Northampton, Kettering and Corby which are the three principal destinations on the A43 route. The A43 also links to the M1 motorway.\n\nThe section of the road between the M40 and M1 is designated a trunk road, managed and maintained by the Highways Agency. The remainder of the route is the responsibility of local authorities.\n\nThe A43 starts at M40 junction 10 (the location of Cherwell Valley Services) which is widely regarded as being one of the worst motorway junctions in the country despite improvements made in the early 2000s. There are often long tailbacks at the junction, even at off-peak times.\n\nFollowing the junction with the M40, the A43 first meets a roundabout with the B4100 for traffic headed north-west for the village of Aynho or south for the town of Bicester. Continuing north, the A43 passes many Oxfordshire and Northamptonshire rural villages and towns before meeting the A421 which spurs towards Buckingham and later, Milton Keynes.\n\nThe stretch of A43 through south Northamptonshire was upgraded to dual carriageway standard between the M1 and Towcester in 1991 and through to the M40 in the early 2000s. This was primarily to provide a link from the M1 to the M40 and also to Silverstone, home of the British Grand Prix. During the Grand Prix the A43 is closed to through traffic between Brackley and Towcester.\n\nThe town of Brackley was bypassed in 1987. Just south of Brackley, drivers will approach a traffic island which spurs off in one direction for the A422 (for the M40 at Banbury and the A423 for motorists heading for Warwickshire) or the other direction which continues as the A43 into Northamptonshire. The A422 is met once again to the east of Brackley, allowing motorists an additional route into Buckinghamshire. Two miles north of Brackley, the B4525 (a B classified route for traffic from South Northamptonshire to reach the M40 at Banbury) joins the A43.\n\nFrom here, the A43 leaves the Oxfordshire borders and continues in a north-easterly direction towards Silverstone, where the road joins the A413 at a grade-separated junction.\n\nLater, the A43 bypasses Towcester, where it meets the A5 (Roman Watling Street) at a roundabout created when the road was built from Towcester in 1991. This roundabout was dangerously unsuited to the traffic volumes but was upgraded with traffic light controls during the first half of 2015. A flyover may need to be installed when the expansion of Towcester begins in 2018-2022. Continuing towards Northampton, it by-passes Blisworth and Milton Malsor villages, before reaching the M1 at junction 15A, at Rothersthorpe services. This stretch has four dangerous crossover junctions - one from Towcester via Old Towcester Road, two from Tiffield and one from Blisworth, unlike the rest of the route from the M40 where the junctions are either fully graded, as at Silverstone, or have roundabouts.\n\nFrom M1 junction 15a the A43 runs concurrently southbound on the M1 to junction 15. It then follows the A45 Nene Valley Way up to the Lumbertubs Way Interchange. From here it splits from the A45 and continues via dual carriageway where it meets the Round Spinney roundabout. North of Northampton, it rejoins the old course of the A43 and passes through Moulton. A new 1.6km dual carriageway bypass is currently being constructed which will link the Round Spinney roundabout with the existing road just north of the Moulton roundabout, which is due for completion in Spring 2018.\n\nFollowing this, the road has a straight, rural stretch before reaching a roundabout at Broughton. After bypassing Broughton, it continues towards Kettering. It overlaps the A14 at its Junction 8, to bypass Kettering. At Junction 7 the A43 re-emerges on a new dual carriageway bypass. The old route of the A43 through Kettering town centre is still intact.\n\nAfter bypassing Kettering, the road previously travelled through the historic village of Geddington. The old road is still regularly used, possibly due to poor signage or lack of SatNav updates. A new bypass, called the Corby Link Road, opened in 2014, from Barford Bridge on the A6003 to the A43 west of Stanion. Continuing from here, it passes the Euro-Hub site at Corby, and then it passes Corby and reaches several roundabouts.\n\nAfter bypassing Corby and Weldon, it heads out on a rural stretch, past Deene Park, and then bypassing Bulwick, the only village on this stretch. It passes some splendid woodland, and then heads towards Duddington.\n\nBypassing Duddington, it meets the A47. After it passes through Collyweston and Easton-on-the-Hill.\n\nThen it meets the A1, before continuing towards Stamford. Previously, the A43 stopped at a junction with the Old A1 (Great North Road) in Stamford, but now that Stamford is bypassed, the A43 continues over the River Welland, until it reaches the A1175.\n\nThe original (1923) route of the A43 was from the A42 (later the A34) at Kidlington to Stamford. After completion of the Oxford Ring Road, the southern terminus was changed to the Pear Tree Roundabout between Kidlington and Oxford. When the M40 was opened in 1991 the road from the Pear Tree Roundabout to Weston-on-the-Green was renumbered A34, and the stretch through Middleton Stoney between the A34 and junction 10 of the M40 was downgraded to the B430.\n\n"}

Such a storm is not related to weather storms except metaphorically, with the deranged immune response being figuratively like a storm with a deluge of cytokines. \n\nThe term \"cytokine storm\" is often loosely used interchangeably with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) but is more precisely a differentiable syndrome that may represent a severe episode of cytokine release syndrome or a component of another disease entity, such as macrophage activation syndrome. When occurring as a result of a therapy, CRS symptoms may be delayed until days or weeks after treatment. Immediate-onset (fulminant) CRS appears to be a cytokine storm.\n\nThe first reference to the term \"cytokine storm\" in the published medical literature appears to be by Ferrara et al. in 1993 in a discussion of graft vs. host disease; a condition in which the role of excessive and self-perpetuating cytokine release had already been under discussion for many years. The term next appeared in a discussion of pancreatitis in 2002, and in 2003 it was first used in reference to a reaction to an infection.\n\nIt is believed that cytokine storms were responsible for the disproportionate number of healthy young adult deaths during the 1918 influenza pandemic, which killed 50 to 100 million people. In this case, a healthy immune system may have been a liability rather than an asset. Preliminary research results from Taiwan also indicated this as the probable reason for many deaths during the SARS epidemic in 2003. Human deaths from the bird flu H5N1 usually involve cytokine storms as well. Cytokine storm has also been implicated in hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.\n\nIn 2006, a study at Northwick Park Hospital in England resulted in all 6 of the volunteers given the drug theralizumab becoming critically ill, with multiple organ failure, high fever, and a systemic inflammatory response. Parexel, a company conducting trials for pharmaceutical companies, in one of its documents, wrote about the trial and said theralizumab could cause a cytokine storm—the dangerous reaction the men experienced.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, several deaths were attributable to cytokine storms.\n"}

{"id": "2321754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321754", "title": "Antelope Canyon", "text": "Antelope Canyon\n\nAntelope Canyon is a slot canyon in the American Southwest, on Navajo land east of Page, Arizona. It includes two separate, scenic slot canyon sections, referred to as Upper Antelope Canyon (or The Crack), and Lower Antelope Canyon (or The Corkscrew). \n\nThe Navajo name for Upper Antelope Canyon is , which means 'the place where water runs through rocks'. Lower Antelope Canyon is (called \"Hasdestwazi\" by the Navajo Parks and Recreation Department), or 'spiral rock arches'. Both are in the LeChee Chapter of the Navajo Nation. They are accessible by guided tour only.\n\nAntelope Canyon was formed by the erosion of Navajo Sandstone due to flash flooding and other sub-aerial processes. Rainwater, especially during monsoon season, runs into the extensive basin above the slot canyon sections, picking up speed and sand as it rushes into the narrow passageways. Over time the passageways eroded away, deepening the corridors and smoothing hard edges to form characteristic \"flowing\" shapes.\n\nFlooding in the canyon still occurs. A flood occurred October 30, 2006 that lasted 36 hours, and caused the Tribal Park Authorities to close Lower Antelope Canyon for five months.\n\nAntelope Canyon is a popular location for photographers and sightseers, and a source of tourism business for the Navajo Nation. It has been accessible by tour only since 1997, when the Navajo Tribe made it a Navajo Tribal Park. Besides the Upper and Lower areas, there are other slots in the canyon that can be visited, such as the Canyon X which is also part of the same drainage as Antelope Canyon. All visits are through one of several licensed tour operators. It is not possible to visit the Canyon independently. \n\nPhotography within the canyons is difficult due to the wide range exposure range (often 10 EV or more) made by light reflecting off the canyon walls. For several years, there was a specialized \"photographer tour\" of the Upper Antelope Canyon, where participants needed to have a tripod and camera. These were discontinued at the end of 2019 to improve the experience for the larger number of people on the general tours. \n\nUpper Antelope Canyon is called , 'the place where water runs through rocks' by the Navajo. It is the most frequently visited by tourists because its entrance and entire length are at ground level, requiring no climbing; and because beams of direct sunlight radiating down from openings at the top of the canyon are much more common. Beams occur most often in summer, as they require the sun to be high in the sky. Winter colors are more muted. Light beams start to peek into the canyon March 20 and disappear by October 7.\nLower Antelope Canyon, called , or 'spiral rock arches' by the Navajo, is located several miles from Upper Antelope Canyon. Prior to the installation of metal stairways, visiting the canyon required climbing pre-installed ladders in certain areas. \n\nEven following the installation of stairways, it is a more difficult hike than Upper Antelope. It is longer, narrower in places, and even footing is not available in all areas. Five flights of stairs of varying widths are currently available to aid in descent and ascent. At the end, the climb out requires flights of stairs. Additionally, sand continually falls from the crack above and can make the stairs slippery.\n\nDespite these limitations, Lower Antelope Canyon draws a considerable number of photographers, though casual sightseers are much less common than in the Upper canyon. Photography-only tours are available around midday when light is at its peak. Photographers cannot bring a tripod.\n\nThe lower canyon is in the shape of a \"V\" and shallower than the Upper Antelope. Lighting is better in the early hours and late morning.\n\nAntelope Canyon is visited exclusively through guided tours, in part because rains during monsoon season can quickly flood it. Rain does not have to fall on or near the Antelope Canyon slots for flash floods to whip through; rain falling dozens of miles away can funnel into them with little notice. \n\nOn August 12, 1997, eleven tourists, including seven from France, one from the United Kingdom, one from Sweden and two from the United States, were killed in Lower Antelope Canyon by a flash flood. Very little rain fell at the site that day, but an earlier thunderstorm dumped a large amount of water into the canyon basin upstream. The lone survivor was tour guide Francisco \"Pancho\" Quintana, who had prior swift-water training. At the time, the ladder system consisted of amateur-built wood ladders that were swept away by the flood. Today, ladder systems have been bolted in place, and deployable cargo nets are installed at the top of the canyon. A NOAA Weather Radio from the National Weather Service and an alarm horn are at the fee booth.\n\nDespite improved warning and safety systems, the risks of injury from flash floods still exists. On July 30, 2010, several tourists were stranded on a ledge when two flash floods occurred at Upper Antelope Canyon. Some of them were rescued and some had to wait for the flood waters to recede. There were reports that a woman and her nine-year-old son were injured as they were washed away downstream, but no fatalities were reported.\n\nThe road to upper Antelope Canyon is gated by the Navajo Nation and entry is restricted to guided tours led by authorized tour guides.\n\n"}

Evelyn Hutchinson\n\nGeorge Evelyn Hutchinson (January 30, 1903 – May 17, 1991), was a British ecologist sometimes described as the \"father of modern ecology.\" He contributed for more than sixty years to the fields of limnology, systems ecology, radiation ecology, entomology, genetics, biogeochemistry, a mathematical theory of population growth, art history, philosophy, religion, and anthropology. He worked on the passage of phosphorus through lakes, the chemistry and biology of lakes, the theory of interspecific competition, and on insect taxonomy and genetics, zoo-geography and African water bugs. He is known as one of the first to combine ecology with mathematics. He became an international expert on lakes and wrote the four-volume \"Treatise on Limnology\" in 1957.\n\nHutchinson earned his degree in zoology from Cambridge University but chose not to earn a doctorate, of which he came to be proud as he aged. Although born in England, he spent nearly his entire professional life at Yale University in the United States where he was Sterling Professor of Zoology and focused on working with graduate students.\n\nHutchinson was born in 1903 to Arthur and Evaline D. Hutchinson. He grew up in Cambridge, England. His father was a mineralogist at the University of Cambridge. Hutchinson grew up surrounded by intellectuals, including two of Darwin's sons. By the age of five, Hutchinson was already collecting aquatic creatures and studying their preferred living environment in aquariums that he manufactured himself. He had a younger brother and a younger sister. He had his early education at Saint Faith's. He went on in 1917 to study at Gresham's School in Norfolk. Gresham's was unique in not focusing on the classics, but including more intensive studies of mathematics and science, along with modern languages and history. It was here that he began to notice that organisms had different chemical environments. Hutchinson read zoology at Cambridge University from 1921 until 1925.\n\nHutchinson married three times. His first wife was Grace Pickford. Grace was also Cambridge educated, she became a well known scientist as well. They were married from 1931 to 1933, when they agreed to a divorce.\nHe met his second wife, Margaret Seal, while on a boat returning to England from India. She was a musician and they shared an appreciation for music, literature, and art. They were married for fifty years, with no children. She died of Alzheimer's in 1983. Hutchinson's third marriage occurred while he was into his eighties to Anne Twitty, a biologist of Haitian descent. He survived all three of his wives and died in London, May 17, 1991.\n\nAfter graduating, he went to Italy to study octopuses. Next he travelled to South Africa where he discovered the field of limnology or the study of freshwater systems, on the shallow lakes near Cape Town. He became an international expert on lakes and wrote a four-volume Treatise on Limnology, with the first volume published in 1957. He took a position teaching zoology at Yale University in 1928. He travelled widely, reaching underexplored parts of the world and writing his first book on the ecology of high-elevation lakes in India. At Yale his graduate students influenced him to research new areas.\n\nAt the age of twenty-two, on graduating from Cambridge, Hutchinson traveled to Italy on a Rockefeller Higher Education Fellowship to work at the Stazione Zoologica. He was interested in doing research on the branchial gland of the octopus. He wanted to establish endocrine function in higher invertebrates. He thought that the branchial gland was the endocrine gland in the octopus, but an octopus shortage put an end to his research. He returned to Italy many times for Italian art, folklore, and to study his Italian ancestry.\n\nIn 1926 he applied for a lectureship at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. He lectured for two years before he was fired, but he continued to study the South African water bugs. When he began his research there were fourteen known species and when he concluded his research there were nearly forty. It was here that Hutchinson discovered limnology, or the study of fresh waters. Along with Grace Pickford, he studied the chemistry and biology of the coastal lakes. He was greatly interested in limnology due to it combining of all his interests such as natural history, aquatic invertebrates, and chemistry. He was drawn to the differences in the chemistry, flora, and fauna in the different water sources.\n\nIn 1932 Hutchinson joined the Yale North India Expedition. He wanted to be the first to make ecological observations of a high-altitude lake, and to compare these with lower-altitude lakes. The work yielded insights into biogeography and new data on high elevation limnology. Most lakes had no fish, and crustaceans were the top predators. In letters to his wife, he described the different water chemistry from the Indian lakes to the South African lakes. He collected hundreds of specimens for analysis by specialists.This expedition provided the material for his first book, \"The Clear Mirror\", in which he described the colors, organisms, ecology, and the people of the Ladakh.\n\nMost of Hutchinson's contributions to American limnology came from research at Linsley Pond in Connecticut. Studies were done on small lakes, such as chemical stratification, oxygen deficits, productivity, and the ecological significance of the oxidation-reduction potential of lake waters. His four volume \"Treatise on Limnology\" became a standard for limnology students. Hutchinson expanded the field of limnology, especially in its ecological and biogeochemical aspects. He advocated the use of statistical and mathematical methods in limnology. His postdoctoral associate Raymond Lindeman furthered Hutchinson's model of the trophic dynamic concept. Together they looked at energy flows through the lake in the trophic levels of ecosystems. They followed the energy using Hutchinson's notation system in which each organism was given an integer to mark how many organisms the energy had to go through in order to reach it, this was designated as its trophic level. It then became possible to measure the efficiency of a given system, or the energy losses between ascending trophic levels.\n\nHutchinson is also recognized as being the first to use radioisotopes as tracers in field experiments. In doing so he along with his graduate student Vaughan Bowen, are credited with creating Radiation Ecology, a brand new major field of ecology. He again turned to Linsley Pond, he released twenty-four portions in two lines and dispersed it uniformly across the water, a week later they collected water across different depths in the lake. They then evaporated and measured the radioactivity, what they found they deemed to be statistically significant. The rest was found to have been taken up by the aquatic plants in the shallow water area of the lake.\n\nHutchinson and his graduate students intellectualized American ecology by \"forcing its practitioners to confront all of the processes that maintain to change ecological systems, whether these processes were biological, physical or geological\". He built on Charles Elton's idea of an ecological niche. He defined it as \"a highly abstract multi-dimensional hyperspace in which the organism's needs and properties were defined as dimensions.\" Hutchinson created the idea of \"Circular Causal Systems\", the tight link between biological and physical processes, and that the activity of organisms balanced the effects on the cycles of chemicals through organisms. He said that the changes in biological productivity were related to the changes of available nutrients. He stated that the condition in which organisms existed were systems of feedback loops. In his systems view, there were both living and non-living feedback systems which followed the same mechanical principles. This led to the development of systems ecology by his student H.T. Odum.\n\nDue to Hutchinson, the European attitudes towards ecology entered America. Before Hutchinson, ecology and natural history were considered identical. After Hutchinson it became legitimate to study the physical and chemical properties of ecosystems in their own right. Hutchinson also raised the idea of climate change 30 years before the problem became popular. He taught his students as early as 1947 that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide would lead to a global temperature increase. He considered the causes and preventatives for extinction, resource management, and the social anthropology of endangered cultures decades before they were attracting attention as crises. He influenced many different areas of ecology, contributing to his designation as the \"Father of Modern Ecology\". His many graduate students went on to careers in ecology. He was the first to describe and resolve the paradox of the plankton in 1961. In 1982, the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, now called the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography honored Hutchinson by creating the G. Evelyn Hutchinson Award, one of the Society's major awards that is given annually to recognize excellence in any aspect of limnology or oceanography.\n\nIn 1949, Hutchinson was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and in 1950 to the National Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the 1952 Leidy Award from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. He was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1984. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1983, awarded the Kyoto Prize in 1986, and posthumously the National Medal of Science in 1991.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2321758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321758", "title": "Prince Hall Freemasonry", "text": "Prince Hall Freemasonry\n\nPrince Hall Freemasonry is a branch of North American Freemasonry for African Americans founded by Prince Hall on September 29, 1784. There are two main branches of Prince Hall Freemasonry: the independent State Prince Hall Grand Lodges, most of which are recognized by Regular Masonic jurisdictions, and those under the jurisdiction of the National Grand Lodge. Prince Hall Freemasonry is the oldest and largest (300,000+ initiated members) predominantly African-American fraternity in the nation.\n\nPrior to the American Revolutionary War, Prince Hall and fourteen other free black men petitioned for admittance to the white Boston St. John's Lodge. They were declined. The Masonic fraternity was attractive to some free blacks like Prince Hall because freemasonry was founded upon ideals of liberty, equality and peace.\n\nHaving been rejected by colonial American Freemasonry, Hall and 14 others sought and were initiated into Masonry through Lodge No. 441 of the Grand Lodge of Ireland on March 6, 1775. The military lodge was attached to the 38th Foot (renamed \"The 1st Staffordshire Regiment\") in 1782. The Lodge was attached to the British forces stationed in Boston. Hall and other freedmen founded African Lodge No. 1 and he was elected Master. Other African Americans included Cyrus Johnston, Bueston Slinger, Prince Rees, John Canton, Peter Freeman, Benjamin Tiler, Duff Ruform, Thomas Santerson, Prince Rayden, Cato Speain, Boston Smith, Peter Best, Forten Horward, and Richard Titley, all of whom apparently were free by birth.\n\nWhen men wished to become Masons in the new nation the existing members of the Lodge had to vote unanimously to accept the petitioner. If any one white member voted against a black petitioner that person would be rejected. In a letter by General Albert Pike to his brother in 1875 he said, \"I am not inclined to mettle in the matter. I took my obligations to white men, not to Negroes. When I have to accept Negroes as brothers or leave Masonry, I shall leave it.\" Masonic and Grand Lodges generally excluded African Americans. Since the votes were anonymous, it was impossible to identify the member who had voted against accepting a black member. The effect was the black men who had legitimately been made Masons in integrated jurisdictions could be rejected. Racial segregation existed until the 1960s.\n\nThe black Masons therefore had limited power. When the military lodges left the area, they were given the authority to meet as a lodge, take part in the Masonic procession on St. John's Day, and bury their dead with Masonic rites but could not confer Masonic degrees or perform any other essential functions of a fully operating Lodge.\n\nUnable to create a charter, they applied to the Grand Lodge of England. The Grand Master of the Premier Grand Lodge of England, H. R. H. The Duke of Cumberland, issued a charter for the African Lodge No. 1 later renamed African Lodge No. 459 September 29, 1784. The lodge was the country's first African Masonic lodge.\n\nDue to the African Lodge's popularity and Prince Hall's leadership, the Grand Lodge of England made Hall a Provincial Grand Master on January 27, 1791. His responsibilities included reporting on the condition of lodges in the Boston area. Six years later, on March 22, 1797 Prince Hall organized a lodge in Philadelphia, called African Lodge #459, under Prince Hall's Charter. They later received their own charter. On June 25, 1797 he organized African Lodge (later known as Hiram Lodge #3) at Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nAuthor and historian James Sidbury said \"Prince Hall and those who joined him to found Boston's African Masonic Lodge built a fundamentally new \"African\" movement on a preexisting institutional foundation. Within that movement they asserted emotional, mythical, and genealogical links to the continent of Africa and its peoples.\n\nIn 1788 John Marrant became the chaplain of the African Masonic Lodge.\n\nThe lodge met in the \"Golden Fleece\", located near Boston Harbor, during the 1780s and 1790s. They later met at Kirby Street Temple in Boston.\n\nBy 1797 there were at least thirty-four members in the Boston black lodge, but still the lodge was overlooked by mainstream Boston Masons. Integration with the American white Masons was not imminent. Since they were unable to attain integration, the blacks concentrated on recognition from white Masons that black Masonry, descending from Prince Hall of Massachusetts, was legitimate and not \"clandestine\". That it had received its charter from the English Grand Lodge and was thus entitled to all Masonic rights such as intervisitation between black and white lodges without prejudice. Many Grand Masters hoped that ultimately recognition would lead to integration but they knew it would be a long time before that happened.\n\nAfter the death of Prince Hall, on December 4, 1807, the brethren were eager to form a Grand Lodge. On June 24, 1808 they organized African Grand Lodge with the lodges from Philadelphia, Providence and Boston, which was later renamed the Prince Hall Grand Lodge, in his honor.\n\nThe Lodge was struck from the rolls after the 1813 merger of the Antients and the Moderns (two rival Grand Lodges of England), along with many other Lodges. \"At the amalgamation of the two Registers after the Union of the two Grand Lodges in England in 1813, African Lodge (and many others at home and abroad) was omitted from the register, there having been no contact for many years. African Lodge was, however, not formally erased.\"\n\nAfter being denied acknowledgment by the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, African Lodge declared itself to be an independent Grand Lodge, the African Grand Lodge of Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1827 the African Grand Lodge declared its independence from the United Grand Lodge of England, as the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts had done 45 years earlier. It also stated its independence from all of the white Grand Lodges in the United States, declaring itself to be a separate Masonic body.\n\nThis led to a tradition of separate, predominantly African-American jurisdictions in North America, known collectively as Prince Hall Freemasonry. Widespread racism and segregation in North America made it impossible for African Americans to join many mainstream lodges, and most mainstream Grand Lodges in North America refused to recognize the Prince Hall Lodges and Prince Hall Masons in their territory as legitimate.\n\nBoth the Prince Hall and \"mainstream\" Grand Lodges have had integrated membership for many years now, though in some Southern states this had been policy but not actual practice. Today, some Prince Hall Grand Lodges are recognized by the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE), as well as the overwhelming majority of US state Grand Lodges and even many international Grand Lodges. The situation is complicated by the level of recognition that is granted, with some lodges giving full \"blanket\" recognition to all Prince Hall Grand Lodges, while others put on limits with regard to issues such as \"intervisitation rights\" or dual membership, sometimes treating Prince Hall Grand Lodges as regular but foreign jurisdictions.\n\nThere are two competing sets of organizations within Prince Hall Freemasonry. A minority of lodges, which are subject to the Prince Hall National Grand Lodge, are referred to as Prince Hall Origin, and the majority of lodges, which are subject to 41 independent state grand lodges, and are known as Prince Hall Affiliation.\n\nThe Conference of Prince Hall Grand Masters determines the regularity of Prince Hall Freemasonry. All regular and recognized Prince Hall Grand Lodges are represented at the Conference. A comprehensive list of all Prince Hall grand lodges deemed regular is listed on the conference website. Each regular Grand Lodge traces its lineage back to African Lodge #459, where Prince Hall was made a Mason. The group using the name Prince Hall Origin has no affiliation to the conference of Prince Hall grand masters.\n\nToday, predominantly black Prince Hall Grand Lodges exist in the original state jurisdictions of the United States; additionally, Prince Hall jurisdictions have been established in Canada, the Caribbean, and Liberia, governing Prince Hall Lodges throughout the world.\n\nThe Prince Hall Grand Lodge of the Caribbean was founded with the assistance of the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of New York. It is based in Christ Church, Barbados, the location of Prince Hall's birth. A monument to Prince Hall has been erected outside the Grand Lodge building. Caribbean Prince Hall Masonry was established in Barbados with the chartering of Prince Hall Memorial Lodge #100 in July 1965 by the Grand Master and officers of the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of the State of New York and Jurisdiction. The same jurisdiction subsequently chartered additional lodges in Guyana, St. Maarten, St. Lucia, Barbados, and Dominica, constituting them into a District administration known as the New York 9th District (Caribbean). In June 1975 senior members met at the New York Sheraton Hotel to commence discussion of the possible formation of an independent Caribbean Grand Lodge. Following many years of discussion the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of the Caribbean and Jurisdiction was finally inaugurated on 24 April 1993.\n\nPrince Hall's legacy as a Freemason and a leader has survived with the lodges; Hall is considered the \"father of African-American Freemasonry\". As a Georgia Mason noted, the original local lodge rules written by Prince Hall and his followers in the late 18th century were the first set of regulations drafted by colored men for self-government in the United States, and Masonry ever since has striven to teach its members 'the fundamentals of central government' which is the basis of American life.\"\n\nAfter nearly two centuries of controversy, the Grand Lodge of England was asked by a US \"mainstream\" Grand Lodge to decide the matter of Prince Hall Masonic legitimacy. \n\nWhile no Grand Lodge of any kind is universally recognized, at present, Prince Hall Masonry is recognized by some UGLE-recognized Grand Lodges and not by others, but it is working its way toward further recognition.\n\nWhen two Grand Lodges recognize and are in Masonic communication with each other, they are said to be \"in amity\", and the brethren of each may visit each other's lodges and interact Masonically. When two Grand Lodges are not in amity, inter-visitation is not allowed. Exclusive Jurisdiction can be waived when the two over-lapping Grand Lodges are themselves in Amity and agree to share jurisdiction (for example, since the Grand Lodge of Connecticut is in Amity with the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Connecticut, the principle of Exclusive Jurisdiction does not apply, and other Grand Lodges may recognize both).\n\nAfter carefully studying the records, the Grand Lodge of England concluded that the original Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts was indeed entitled to Masonic recognition, despite the general tradition of \"exclusive jurisdiction\", which meant that only one recognized Masonic body could exist in each state.\n\nAccording to data compiled in 2019, 44 out of the 51 mainstream U.S. Grand Lodges recognize Prince Hall Grand Lodges. The few mainstream state Grand Lodges that currently do not recognize Prince Hall Grand Lodges are, except for West Virginia, located in southern states, an area with an estimated 50% of Prince Hall Freemasons: Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, South Carolina and West Virginia. While African-Americans can join any lodge in North America, Prince Hall Masonry remains a vital part of American tradition.\n\nThe organisation is named after:\nThere have been many other notable Masons who were affiliated with Prince Hall originated Grand Lodges, including:\n\n\n\n"}

His father, Damião Ribeiro, was implicated in the conspiracy against King John II in 1484, and had to flee to Castile, where young Bernardim and his mother took refuge with their relatives Antonio and Ignez Zagalo at the Quinta dos Lobos, near Sintra.\n\nWhen Manuel I came to the Portuguese throne in 1495, he rehabilitated the families persecuted by his predecessor, and Ribeiro was able to leave his retreat and return to Torrão. Meanwhile Dona Ignez had married a rich landowner of Estremoz, and in 1503 she was summoned to court and appointed one of the attendants to the Infanta Beatriz. Ribeiro accompanied her, and through her influence the king took him under his protection and sent him to the University of Lisbon, where he studied from 1506 to 1512. When he obtained his degree in law, the king showed him further favour by appointing him to the post of , or secretary, and later by bestowing on him the habit of the Military Order of São Thiago.\n\nRibeiro's poetic career began with his coming to court, and his early verses are to be found in the of Garcia de Resende. He took part in the historic , or palace evening entertainments, which largely consisted of poetical improvisations. There he met, and earned the friendship of, the poets Sá de Miranda and Cristóvão Falcão, who became his literary comrades and the confidantes of his romance, in which hope deferred and bitter disappointment ended in tragedy.\n\nRibeiro had early conceived a violent passion for his cousin, Dona Joanna Zagalo, the daughter of his protectress, Dona Ignez. However, her family opposed her marriage to a singer and dreamer with small means and prospects, and finally compelled her to wed a rich man, one Pero Gato. When the latter died shortly afterwards, Joanna retired to a house in the country, where it was rumored that Ribeiro was a visitor, and in 1521 she went into seclusion in the convent of St Clare at Estremoz, where she died some years later. It was alleged that Ribeiro's conduct had caused a scandal which led the king to deprive him of his office and exile him.\n\nRibeiro poured out his heart in five eclogues, the earliest in Portuguese, written in the popular octosyllabic verse; and now, hopeless of the future and broken in spirit, he decided to go to Italy, for a poet the land of promise. He started early in 1522, travelling widely in the peninsula, and during his stay he wrote his moving knightly and pastoral romance , mostly known as (taken from its incipit), in which he related the story of his unfortunate passion, personifying himself under the anagram of \"Bimnarder,\" and Dona Ignez under that of \"Aonia.\" The title is translated as \"Maiden and Modest\", and is regarded as one of the finest examples of the genre of pastoral romance in Renaissance literature.\n\nWhen he returned home in 1524, the new king, John III, restored him to his former post, and it is said that he paid a last visit to his love at St Clare's convent and found her in a fit of madness. From that time his mental powers declined. About 1534 he suffered a long illness, and he continued to decline until his death. He was unable to fulfil the duties of his office, and in 1549 the king bestowed upon him a pension for his support. He did not live long to enjoy it, as in 1552 he died in All Saints Hospital in Lisbon.\n\nThe was not printed until after Ribeiro's death, and then first in Ferrara in 1554. On its appearance the book made such a sensation that its reading was forbidden, because it disclosed a family tragedy which the allegory could not hide. It is divided into two parts, the first of which is certainly the work of Ribeiro. However, opinion has been divided on the second. One edition of the first part was made by Dr José Pessanha (Oporto, 1891), and a more current edition was made in 2012 (see bibliography). Ribeiro's verses, including his five eclogues, were reprinted in a limited edition by Dr Xavier da Cunha (Lisbon, 1886).\n\n"}

It falls within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Greensburg.\n\nConstruction of Greensburg Central Catholic High School began in the summer of 1958, only seven years after the founding of the Diocese of Greensburg. The first class of freshmen entered in September 1959, including students from as far east as Ligonier and as far west as Trafford.\n\nBishop Hugh L. Lamb dedicated the building November 29, 1959, before an audience of 2,000 which included Governor David L. Lawrence as the featured speaker. This large audience was somewhat surprising given the extremely cold and snowy weather on the day of the dedication. In fact, according to the \"Greensburg Tribune-Review\":\n\nAt the time of Greensburg Central Catholic’s founding, six Roman Catholic religious institutes provided most of the faculty. The Sisters of St. Benedict were responsible for teaching languages; the Sisters of Charity, science and music; the Felician Sisters, mathematics; the Sisters of Mercy, English; the Sisters of St. Joseph, social studies; and the Vincentian Sisters of Charity, business. Lay teachers handled physical education.\n\nIn 1962, Bishop William G. Connare proposed the building of a faculty house for all six religious groups, featuring a wing for each community with a common chapel (the Chapel of the Immaculate Heart of Mary), dining room, and community room. The first Mass was offered in this chapel on August 31, 1963.\n\nThese religious communities served Greensburg Central Catholic for years, and many alumni remember them fondly. The Sisters of Charity are the only remaining religious institute at Central.\n\nThe original curriculum of the school was primarily academic, but a general course and a business course were soon added. Father Shuda, the school's third principal, urged the construction of an addition to the school, also designed by Francis O’Connor Church. The Fathers’ Club and Mothers’ Club (now replaced by one group, the Parents’ Club) helped with furnishings and installation.\n\nOver the years, Greensburg Central Catholic has constantly updated and improved its curriculum and facilities to better serve its students and the community. It currently offers a diverse curriculum including Advanced Placement and college credit courses as well as business and general study courses. A stadium was built in 1989 and lights were installed in 1998 for night football and soccer games.\n\n2011 saw the introduction of a new Junior High program. For the first time in its history, the school housed a 7th and 8th grade. The project necessitated multiple renovations to the building. The former art class rooms were converted into multi-purpose classrooms for the new grades, the former weight room was made into the library, and the current weight room sits where the stage used to be, next to the main gym. Although the junior and senior high schools are mostly segregated from one another, certain high-school level courses are available for 8th graders to take. \n\nToday there are students who, drawn by the school's well known academic and athletic programs, come from as far west as Charleroi.\n\nThe athletics program at Greensburg Central Catholic is one of the most successful in the state of Pennsylvania. The school has won three state championships and countless WPIAL titles. The most successful sports program at Central is the ice hockey team, which won three state championships in the 90s and has been a state power for the past twenty years. The football program has received widespread notoriety as a result of back to back WPIAL championship game appearances in 2005 and 2006, before winning the WPIAL championship and appearing in the PIAA championship game.

A generation of artists who shared his style of art include the painters Nicolas Poussin and Giovanni Battista Passeri, the sculptors Alessandro Algardi and François Duquesnoy, and the contemporary biographer Giovanni Bellori.\n\nSacchi was born in Rome. His father, Benedetto, was an undistinguished painter. According to the biographer Giovanni Pietro Bellori (who was also a great friend of Sacchi's), Andrea initially entered the studio of Cavalier d'Arpino. These are Bellori's words:\n\nSacchi later entered Francesco Albani's workshop and spent most of his time in Rome where he eventually died. Much of his early career was helped by the regular patronage by Cardinal Antonio Barberini, who commissioned art for the Capuchin church in Rome and the Palazzo Barberini.\n\nA contemporary rival of Pietro da Cortona, Sacchi studied the paintings of Raphael and the influence of Raphael is apparent in a number of his works, particularly with reference to the use of few figures and their expressions. He reputedly travelled to Venice and Parma and studied the works of Correggio.\n\nTwo of his major works on canvas are altarpieces now displayed in the Pinacoteca Vaticana, the painting gallery in the Vatican (see Main works below).\n\nAs a young man, Sacchi had worked under Cortona at the Villa Sacchetti at Castelfusano (1627–1629). But in a set of public debates at the Accademia di San Luca, the guild for artists in Rome, he strongly criticized Cortona's exuberance. The debate is significant because it indicates how two of the leading proponents of the prevailing styles in painting, now called 'Classical' and 'Baroque', discussed the differences between their work.\n\nIn particular, Sacchi advocated that since a unique, individual expression, gesture and movement needed to be assigned to each figure in a composition, so a painting should only have a few figures. In a crowded composition, the figures would be deprived of individuality, and thus cloud the particular meaning of the piece. In some ways this was a reaction against the zealous excess of crowds in paintings by artists such as Zuccari in the previous generation, and by Cortona among his contemporaries. Simplicity and unity were essential to Sacchi who, drawing an analogy to poetry, likened painting to tragedy. In his counter-argument, Cortona made the case that large paintings with lots of figures were like an epic which could develop multiple sub-themes. But for Sacchi, the encrustation of a painting with excess decorative details, including melees of crowds, would represent something akin to 'wall-paper' art rather than focused narrative. Among the partisans of Sacchi's argument for simplicity and focus were his friends, the sculptor Algardi and painter Poussin. The controversy was however less pitched than some might suggest.\n\nSacchi and Albani, among others, shared dissatisfaction with the artistic depiction of low or genre subjects and themes, such as those preferred by the Bamboccianti and even the Caravaggisti. They felt that high art should focus on exalted themes- biblical, mythological, or from classical ancient history.\n\nSacchi, who worked almost always in Rome, left few pictures visible in private galleries. He had a flourishing school: Carlo Maratta was a younger collaborator or pupil. In Maratta's large studio, Sacchi's preference for a grand manner style would find pre-eminence among Roman circles for decades to follow. But many others worked under him or his influence including Francesco Fiorelli, Luigi Garzi, Francesco Lauri, Andrea Camassei, and Giacinto Gimignani. Sacchi's own illegitimate son Giuseppe, died young after high hopes for his future.\n\nSacchi died at Nettuno in 1661.\n\nThis fresco by Sacchi in the Palazzo Barberini in Rome is considered his masterpiece. It depicts \"Divine Wisdom\" (1629–33). The work was inspired by Raphael's \"Parnasus\" in the Raphael's Rooms in the Vatican Palace.\n\nAccording to the American art historian Joseph Connors:\n\nAlso known as the \"Miracle of St Gregory the Great\", this painting was executed in 1625-57. It is now in the Pinacoteca Vaticana.\n\nThe canvas portrays the legend that the Empress Constantia had begged Pope Gregory I to give her relics of the body of Saints Peter and Paul, but the pope, not daring to disturb the remains of these saints, sent her a fragment of the linen which had enveloped the remains of Saint John the Evangelist. Constantia rejected this gift from the pope as insufficient. Then Gregory, to prove the power of relics to work miracles (and justify their worth), placed the cloth on the altar, and, after praying, pierced it with a knife, and blood flowed from it as from a living body. In 1771, a mosaic copy of this painting was made for the Basilica of St Peter's. This painting echoes positions stated in the canons of the Council of Trent: wherein relics had an important role in miracles, the pope served as the final interpreter of sanctity, and finally it was a metaphor of the validity of the eucharist as the true body of Christ.\n\nCompleted in 1631, this painting in the Pinacoteca Vaticana recalls an episode in the life of the early Benedictine monk, Saint Romuald, of the Camaldolese Order, who is said to have dreamt that members of his Order wearing white ascended into heaven (as seen in background). The serenity and gravity of the monks, arrayed as in philosophic discourse, is characteristic of Sacchi.\n\nOther leading examples of Sacchi's work are \"The Death of St. Anne\", in San Carlo ai Catinari, Rome;\"St. Andrew\", in the Quirinal Palace; \"St. Joseph\", at Caponile Case; and \"The Three Marys\" (1634), at Palazzo Barberini, Rome. Other altarpieces by Sacchi are in Perugia, Foligno and Camerino.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2321823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321823", "title": "Siam Nikaya", "text": "Siam Nikaya\n\nThe Siam (also Siyamopali and Siyam) Nikaya is a monastic order within Sri Lanka, founded by Upali Thera and located predominantly around the city of Kandy. It is so named because it originated within Thailand (formerly known in Europe as the \"Kingdom of Siam\"). The Siyam Nikaya has two major divisions (Malwatta and Asgiriya) and five other divisions within these two major units. The Malwatta and Asgiriya chapters have two separate Maha Nayakas or chief Monks.\n\nOn the initiative of Ven. Weliwita Saranankara (1698–1778) the Thai monk Upali visited the Kingdom of Kandy in 1753 during the reign of Kirti Sri Rajasinha of Kandy (1747–1782), and there performed upasampada for a group of Kandyans. The Buddhist monastic order had become extinct thrice during the preceding five hundred years and was reestablished in the reigns of Vimala Dharma Suriya I (1591–1604) and Vimala Dharma Suriya II (1687–1707) as well. These reestablishments were short lived.\n\nAlthough hagiographies written within Sri Lanka avoid the issue, the foundation of the Siam Nikaya was closely linked to both the aristocratic and caste politics of its era, including an attempted coup d'état that is unusually well-documented, due to the interaction of the colonial Dutch and the king of Kandy at the time:\nUpali Thera believed the Buddhist Sangha in Kandy was suffering from a state of corruption, which included the practice of astrology and his efforts were aimed at \"purifying\" the practices of the monastic order. It was also through the efforts of Upali Thera that the Kandy Esala Perahera came into being. Annually in Kandy there is a celebration which includes a parade in which the focus is the relic of the tooth of the Buddha. This procession was originally focused on honor to Hindu deities, particularly those incorporated into Sri Lankan Buddhism. Upali Thera believed this to be inappropriate in a Buddhist nation, and his influence led to the king declaring that \"Henceforth Gods and men are to follow the Buddha\".\n\nBy the mid-18th century, upasampada (higher ordination, as distinct from samanera or novice ordination) had become extinct in Sri Lanka again. The Buddhist order had become extinct thrice during the preceding five hundred years and was re-established in the reigns of Vimala Dharma Suriya I (1591–1604) and Vimala Dharma Suriya II (1687–1707) as well. These re-establishments were short lived. On the initiative of Weliwita Sri Saranankara Thero (1698–1778) the Thai monk Upali Thera visited Kandy during the reign of king Kirti Sri Rajasinghe (1747–1782) and once again reestablished the Buddhist order in Sri Lanka in 1753. It was called the Siyam Nikaya after the \"Kingdom of Siam\".\nHowever, in 1764, merely a decade after the re-establishment of the Buddhist order in Sri Lanka by reverend Upali, a group within the newly created Siyam Nikaya conspired and succeeded in restricting the Nikaya's higher ordination only to the Radal and Goigama caste, Sitinamaluwe Dhammajoti (Durawa) being the last nongovigama monk receive his upasampada. This was a period when Buddhist Vinaya rules had been virtually abandoned and some members of the Buddhist Sangha in the Kandyan Kingdom privately held land, had wives and children, resided in the private homes and were called Ganinnanses. It was a period when the traditional nobility of the Kandyan Kingdom was decimated by continuous wars with the Dutch rulers of the Maritime Provinces. In the maritime provinces too a new order was replacing the old. Mandarampura Puvata, a text from the Kandyan period, narrates the above radical changes to the monastic order and shows that it was not a unanimous decision by the body of the sangha. It says that thirty-two ‘senior’ members of the Sangha who opposed this change were banished to Jaffna by the leaders of the reform.\nThe Govigama exclusivity of the Sangha thus secured in 1764 was almost immediately challenged by other castes who without the patronage of the King of Kandy or of the British, held their own upasampada ceremony at Totagamuwa Vihara in 1772. Another was held at Tangalle in 1798. Neither of these ceremonies were approved by the Siam Nikaya which claimed that these were not in accordance with the Vinaya rules.\n\nThe principal places of Buddhist worship in Sri Lanka including the Temple of the Tooth Relic, Adam's Peak, Kelaniya and over 6,000 other temples are now under the administration of the Siyam Nikaya.\nFrom time immemorial the sacred Tooth Relic of Gautama Buddha has been considered the symbol of the rulers of Sri Lanka. As time went on, the seat of the kingdom was moved from Anuradhapura to Polonnaruwa, then to Dambadeniya and other cities. Upon each change of capital, a new palace was built to enshrine the Relic. Finally, it was brought to Kandy where it is at present, in the Temple of the Tooth. The oldest Buddhist sect in Sri Lanka, the Siam Nikaya (estd. 19 July 1753) are the custodians of the Tooth Relic, since its establishment during the Kandyan Kingdom. The Siyam Nikaya traditionally grants Higher ordination only to the Radala and Govigama castes, Sitinamaluwe Dhammajoti (Durawa) being the last nongovigama monk receive upasampada. This conspiracy festered within the Siyam nikaya itself and Moratota Dhammakkandha, Mahanayaka of Kandy, with the help of the last two Kandyan Telugu Kings victimized the low country Mahanayaka Karatota Dhammaranma by confiscating the Sri Pada shrine and the retinue villages from the low country fraternity and appointing a rival Mahanayaka (Presently, an exception is the Rangiri Dambula sect which welcomes all communities while being a Siyam nikaya subsect).\n\nThe caste based discrimination made many Karava, Salagama, Durava, Bathgama, Deva & other castes people considered as 'low' by the Govi to become Catholics and Anglicans. The Siyam Nikaya as custodians of the Tooth Relic have always received the full support and patronage of the Govigama dominated Sri Lankan State and its Ministers and Ministries of Buddha Sasana, Cultural Affairs and others, the monopolisation of the 'Tooth' relic by the Radala and Govi combination on caste based lines have brought shame and a bad reputation to Buddhism in Sri Lanka, which resembles the white apartheid rule in South Africa, where only the whites were able to enjoy certain privileges. In many of his discourses the lord Buddha had specifically mentioned against caste based discrimination. It is often overlooked that the largest Buddhist converts today are the Indian Dalit community, a practice that had also been common in the history of Buddhism. During the late 19th century when Buddhism was at the brink of extinction, due to Christian missionaries and the British government, it was a Salagama caste Amarapura nikaya Buddhist monk, Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera, with his oratorical skills and sharp logical arguments soundly defeated the Christians at Panadura Vaadaya, with the assistance of other minorities. Subsequently, the American, Col. Henry Steel Olcott after reading literature on the Panadura Debate, decided to visit Sri Lanka & helped Buddhism including the establishment of the earliest Buddhist schools such as Ananda college, Dharmaraja College and Mahinda College. These minority communities are also responsible for establishing the earliest Buddhist Girls schools in the island nation. The Amarapura Chapter was established in 1802. A number of monks of this Chapter had participated in foreign missionary work throughout the world.

It is served by one commercial airline, Boutique Air, which is subsidized by the Essential Air Service program. Formerly, the facility was known as Greenville Air Force Base.\n\nAs per the Federal Aviation Administration, this airport had 6,310 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 6,290 in 2009, 6,609 in 2010, 7,417 in 2011, and 5,181 in 2012. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a \"non-primary commercial service\" airport.\n\nMid-Delta Regional Airport is the only commercial airport located in the Mississippi Delta. Located approximately north of central Greenville, MDRA is situated on of land, with a sizable portion in the Mid-Delta Empowerment Zone. A controlled airfield, MDRA has a control tower which is manned from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., seven days a week.\n\nThe facility has two runways, the primary being 18L/36R which is composed of an asphalt surface wide by long. Runway 18L/36R is a precision approach runway with an Instrument landing System (ILS), medium approach lighting system with rails, (MALSR) approach lights and High Intensity Runway Lights (HIRLs). A parallel runway, 18R/36L, has an asphalt and concrete surface with a width of and length of . Runway 18R/36L is a non-precision runway with Medium Intensity Runway Lights, (MIRL). The runways are connected by six taxiways.

At that time there were 17 aircraft based at this airport: 88% single-engine and 12% jet.\n\nHistorically, the airport had scheduled passenger service provided by Southern Airways with Douglas DC-9-10 jetliners. Southern operated nonstop flights to Memphis with direct service to Baton Rouge and New Orleans via an intermediate stop in Monroe, Louisiana and also on a direct, one stop basis to Atlanta. Other flights operated by Southern continued on direct, no change of plane routings to Chicago, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale. Southern then merged with North Central Airlines to form Republic Airlines which in turn continued to serve Greenville. Republic operated DC-9 jet service to Memphis, Baton Rouge and New Orleans, and also provided direct, one stop or two stop jet service to Atlanta. Some Republic jet flights continued on to Washington D.C. (Dulles Airport) and New York City (LaGuardia Airport) on a direct, no change of plane basis. Republic subsequently ceased all flights from Greenville and withdrew from the market.\n\nIn May 2015, SeaPort Airlines announced that it planned to end service to and from the airport. After receiving proposals from four airlines, the Greenville city council unanimously chose Boutique Air as its next airline.\n\nOn 3 June 2018, a storm system destroyed the hangar and most of the aircraft at the airport.\n\n"}

His most considerable work, \"Castro,\" is the first tragedy in Portuguese, and the second in modern European literature.\n\nFerreira was a native of Lisbon. His father held the post of \"escrivão de fazenda\" (estate clerk) in the house of the Duke of Coimbra at Setúbal. In 1547, he went to the University of Coimbra, and graduated with a bachelor's degree.\nHe took his doctor's degree on 14 July 1555, an event which was celebrated, according to custom, by a sort of Roman triumph, and he stayed on as a professor, finding Coimbra, with its picturesque environs, congenial to his poetical tastes and love of a country life.\n\nFerreira was intimate with princes, nobles and the most distinguished literary men of the time, such as the scholarly Diogo de Teive, and the poets Bernardes, Caminha and Corte-Real. In 1558, at the age of 29, he married D. Maria Pimentel. After a short and happy married life, his wife died.\n\nOn 14 October 1567, he became \"Desembargador da Casa do Cível\", and had to leave the quiet of Coimbra for Lisbon. His verses tell how he disliked the change, and how the bustle of the capital, then a great commercial emporium, made him sad and almost tongue-tied for poetry. The intrigues and moral twists of the courtiers and traders, among whom he was forced to live, hurt his fine sense of honor, and he felt his mental isolation more, because his friends were few and scattered in that great city which the discoveries and conquests of the Portuguese had made the centre of a world empire.\n\nIn 1569, a terrible epidemic of carbunculous fever broke out and carried off 50,000 inhabitants of Lisbon, and, on 29 November, Ferreira, who had stayed there doing his duty when others fled; fell a victim.\n\nFerreira wrote the Terentian prose comedy, \"Bristo\" in (1553), at the age of twenty-five, and dedicated it to Prince John in the name of the university. It is neither a comedy of character nor manners, but its \"vis comica\" lies in its plot and situations. The \"Cioso\", a later product, may almost be called a comedy of character.\n\nThe death in 1554 of Prince John, the heir to the throne, drew from him, as from Camões, Bernardes and Caminha, a poetical lament, which consisted of an elegy and two eclogues, imitative of Virgil and Horace. Later, the year 1557 produced his sixth elegy, addressed to the son of Afonso de Albuquerque, a poem of noble patriotism expressed in eloquent and sonorous verse.\n\nThe sonnets forming the First Book in his collected works, date from 1552 and contain the history of his early love for an unknown lady. They seem to have been written in Coimbra or during vacations in Lisbon. The sonnets in the Second Book were inspired by his wife, and they are marked by that chastity of sentiment, seriousness and ardent patriotism. The ninth sonnet of Book 2, written after her premature death, describes her end in moving words. This loss lent Ferreira's verse an added austerity, and the independence of his muse is remarkable when he addresses King Sebastian and reminds him of his duties as well as his rights.\n\n\"Castro\" is Ferreira's most considerable work, and the first tragedy in Portuguese, and the second in modern European literature. Though fashioned on the great models of the ancients, it has little plot or action, and the characters, except that of the prince, are ill-designed. It is a splendid poem, with a chorus which sings the sad fate of Inês in musical odes, rich in feeling and grandeur of expression. His love is the chaste, timid affection of a wife and a vassal, rather than the strong passion of a mistress, but Pedro is really the man, history describes, the love-fettered prince whom the tragedy of Inês’s death converted into the cruel tyrant. King Afonso is little more than a shadow, and only meets Inês once, his son never; while, stranger still, Pedro and Inês never come on the stage together, and their love is merely narrated. Nevertheless, Ferreira merits all praise for choosing one of the most dramatic episodes in Portuguese history for his subject, and though it has since been handled by poets of renown in many different languages, none has been able to surpass the old master.\n\nFerreira also authored a brief epic poem called \"Historia de S.ta Comba dos Valles\" (History of Saint Comba of the Valleys), based on a religious legend of Lamas de Orelhão, Valpaços tracing to the Moorish occupation in pre-foundation Portugal.\n\nFerreira's ideal, as a poet, was to win the applause of the good, and, in the preface to his poems, he says, \"I am content with this glory, that I have loved my land and my people.\" He was intimate with the aged Sá de Miranda, the founder of the classical school of which Ferreira became the foremost representative. Horace was his favorite poet, erudition his muse, and his admiration of the classics made him disdain the popular poetry of the Old School (\"Escola Velha\") represented by Gil Vicente.\n\nHis national feeling would not allow him to write in Latin or Spanish, like most of his contemporaries, but his Portuguese is as Latinized as he could make it, and he even calls his poetical works, \"Poemas Lusitanos\". Sá de Miranda had philosophized in the familiar redondilha, introduced the epistle and founded the comedy of learning.\nIt was the beginning of a revolution, which Ferreira completed by abandoning the traditional peninsular verse forms for the Italian hendecasyllable, and by composing the noble and austere Roman poetry of his letters, odes and elegies. It was all done of set purpose, for he was a reformer conscious of his mission and resolved to carry it out. The gross realism of the popular poetry, its lack of culture and its carelessness of form, offended his educated taste, and its picturesqueness and ingenuity made no appeal to him.\n\n\n"}

In some mosses such as members of the Polytrichaceae family, hydroids form the innermost layer of cells in the stem. At maturity they are long, colourless, thin walled cells of small diameter, containing water but no living protoplasm. Collectively, hydroids function as a conducting tissue, known as the hydrome, transporting water and minerals drawn from the soil. They are surrounded by bundles of living cells known as leptoids which carry sugars and other nutrients in solution. The hydroids are analogous to the tracheids of vascular plants but there is no lignin present in the cell walls to provide structural support.\n\nHydroids have been found in some fossilised plants from the Rhynie chert, including \"Aglaophyton\", where they were initially mistaken for xylem tracheids.\n\n"}

One of his descendants was Ivy Emma Craig, who married Captain Reginald Hosking which also includes Joshua Harry Keijsers as one of their descendants.\n\nIn Edinburgh he lived on Warriston Close off the Royal Mile.\n\nCraig was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and at the University of St Andrews, where he took the Bachelor of Arts degree in 1555. From St. Andrews he went to France, to study canon law and civil law. In Paris from 1555 to 1561, he studied civil law under François Baudouin. His work on feudal law shows the influence of François Hotman, which must be later.\n\nCraig returned to the Kingdom of Scotland about 1561, and was admitted advocate in February 1563. In 1564, he was appointed justice-depute by the justice-general, Archibald Campbell, 5th Earl of Argyll; and in this capacity he presided at many of the criminal trials of the period in Edinburgh, and in 1606 was made procurator for the church. He never became a lord of session, a circumstance that was unquestionably due to his own choice.\n\nHe is said to have refused the honour of knighthood which James VI conferred on him in 1604. He had come to London as one of the Scottish commissioners regarding the personal union between the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England, the only political object he seems to have cared about. But in accordance with James's command he has always been styled and reputed a knight.\n\nHe died in Edinburgh in 1608.\n\nExcept his poems, the only one of Craig's works which appeared during his lifetime was his \"Jus feudale\" (1603). Editions of the book were produced by Robert Burnet (Edinburgh, 1655), Lüder Mencke (Leipzig, 1716) and James Baillie (Edinburgh, 1732). A two volume English translation by Scottish judge Lord Clyde was published in 1934. In 2017, the Stair Society published the first volume of a new three part Latin edition of \"Jus Feudale\" with facing English translation by classicist and lawyer Leslie Dodd.

His first wife Helen Hamilton of 1573, who died in 1575, was the niece or granddaughter of Robert Richardson. His second wife of 1578 was Helen, daughter of Robert Heriot of Lumphoy in Midlothian, by whom he had four sons and three daughters; she was also the step-daughter of Edward Henryson, her mother Helen Swinton's second husband. \n\nJohn Craig, who married Isabel Gouldie who was born in 1612, she died in 1645.

Over the course of several days, Karl commits a series of murders across the countryside, mutilating and occasionally cannibalizing his victims. After one double homicide, Karl faints and has a flashback to the day he murdered his mother, revealing he had been coerced into killing her by a demon (which a line of dialogue indicates may be his father) he had encountered in the cellar after being locked in it.\n\nAt one point, Karl also encounters an apparition of Jesus crucified in the forest, which he hacks open, and crawls inside.

Reviewing the DVD release for the \"Violent Shit Collection\", Nathaniel Thompson from \"Mondo Digital\" called the film \"a nearly plotless VHS wonder\", criticizing the film's technical ineptitude, and unconvincing gore effects.\nBrett Gallman from \"Oh, the Horror!\" praised the film's raw violence, stating, \"However crude the rest of this amateur production may be, there’s no denying the power of this gore-soaked mayhem. Both Schnaas’s willingness to push boundaries and his attention to squeamish detail are noteworthy... forcing the audience to either confront it head on or look away in disgust.\" Gallman concluded his review by writing, \"Underestimate and judge the surface of \"Violent Shit\" at your own risk because this is the stuff of pure, uncut nightmare fuel.\"\n\nA name-only remake entitled \"Violent Shit: The Movie\", was released in 2015.

The game features nitrous boosts, similar to that of other racing games. \"Juiced\" went to number one in the United Kingdom MCV sales charts and its first version sold 2.5 million units.\n\nThe game is set in a fictional Californian city called Angel City, based on Los Angeles. Angel City is composed of eight districts, San Ricardo, Campbell Hills, Downtown, Angel North Central, Angel Westside, Southside Beach, East Angel Island and Anderson. The districts are controlled by rival crews in the game, and the player can host events at different districts if they get enough Respect.\n\nThere are four different racing types:\n\nThere are not only races in which every racer is a rival, but also crew races comprising two racers from one crew (\"2 vs 2 vs 2\", as well as \"2 vs 2\"), as well as composed of three members of the same crew (\"3 vs 3\"). In these races, all of the racers of one same crew must cross the line before any other crew does to win the race.\n\nIn the Career mode, if the player achieves a minimum of 600 respect (explained below) with a certain rival crew, they can participate in Pink Slip races (Sprint, Point-to-point or Circuit races in which both racers bet their cars).\n\nThe Custom Race mode features an Alone mode as well so the player can race any circuit with no racers, no time limit and no laps count.\n\n\"Juiced\" was originally intended to be published by Acclaim Entertainment, and released for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and PC in late 2004. However, the game was caught up in Acclaim's Chapter 7 bankruptcy issues and never released by them. Game magazines around the world wrote reviews on nearly finished copies of the game. It was then picked up by THQ as the new publisher and later released in 2005. \n\"Juiced\" received \"mixed or average reviews\" on all platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nRight before the bankruptcy issues by Acclaim, Lisa Mason of \"Game Informer\" gave the beta version of the game a score of 5.75 out of 10 in its October 2004 issue, stating that it \"falls to the lower end of the goodness scale. [...] Depending on what I am doing, I yearn for any of the more-polished (and more playable) racing titles that it tries to emulate. \"Juiced\"s particular mix of sim and arcade racing is best summed up as a failed experiment.\" After the THQ acquirement and redevelopment of the game, however, Mason raised the rating to 7 out of 10 in her Second Opinion in the magazine's July 2005 issue, calling it \"an exponentially better game than it was when I reviewed it many months ago. Does that mean that it's a super awesome, edge of your seat thrill ride? Not so much, but it does have its charms and is a nicely varied street racer.\" Matthew Kato of the same publisher agreed, giving the game a better score of 7.5 out of 10 and saying that it \"certainly has the makings of an average street racer, with lots of customizables and affected street appeal.\"\n\n\"The Times\" gave the game four stars out of five and stated, \"The gameplay is varied enough to maintain interest, and its clutch of quirky distractions adds to the experience. After all its development setbacks, it's definitely worth a spin.\" \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" gave the PS2 version four-and-a-half stars out of five and said that it was \"instantly approachable\". However, \"Playboy\" gave the same version 70%; likewise, \"Detroit Free Press\" gave the similar version two stars out of four, criticizing the costly upgrades, but praising the musical selection that \"features a nice mix of techno, rock and hip-hop.\" In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave the same console version a score of one eight and three sevens for a total of 29 out of 40.\n\nIn 2006, \"\" was released for the PlayStation Portable and mobile phones. \"\" was released in 2007.\n\n"}

The first published version appeared as \"Levee Song\" in \"Carmina Princetonia\", a book of Princeton University songs published in 1894. The earliest known recording is by the Sandhills Sixteen, released by Victor Records in 1927.\n\nThe melody of the opening line of \"Ive Been Working on the Railroad\" may have been inspired by the very similar melody at the beginning of the cello solo about one minute into Franz von Suppé's 1846 \"Poet and Peasant\" overture.\n\nThe verses that generally constitute the modern version of the song are:\n\nThe 1894 version includes one verse very much like the modern song, though in negro minstrel dialect, and with an intro that is no longer sung, and a very different second verse:\n\nThe \"Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah\" section, with its noticeably different melody, is actually an older song that has been absorbed by \"I've Been Working on the Railroad\". It was published as \"Old Joe, or Somebody in the House with Dinah\" in London in the 1830s or '40s, with music credited to J.H. Cave. \"Dinah\" was a generic name for a slave woman, and by extension, any woman of African-American descent. The melody for this section of the song may have been adapted from \"Goodnight, Ladies\", written (as \"Farewell Ladies\") in 1847 by E.P. Christy.\n\nAccording to the liner notes to Pete Seeger's \"Children's Concert at Town Hall\" (1963), the \"Dinah won't you blow\" section is a more modern addition, contributed to the song by \"some college students\".\n\nA high school glee club songbook circa 1947 used this introduction:\nThe remainder was the modern version.\n\nOne extant verse that has been recorded in prominent sources follows the \"Singin' fee, fie, fiddly-i-o\" verse:\n\nIn another version of \"I've Been Working on the Railroad\" that is printed in \"The Family Car Songbook\", researched and edited by Tam Mossman, the song continues as follows:\n\nJapanese\n\nAn adaptation of this song is a very familiar nursery rhyme in Japan, with the same melody and roughly the same subject matter, but with a different title and different lyrics. It is known as \"\", meaning \"The railroad continues forever\".\n\nNHK introduced this version of the song in 1967 in a TV program called \"Minna no Uta\" (\"Everyone's Songs\").\n\nThis tune is used at the stations on the Hanshin Electric Railway Lines (except Umeda Station and Ōsaka Namba Station) to announce arriving trains and is similarly used at Okayama Station on the San'yō Line (for Kamigōri and Himeji) and the Akō Line (for Banshū-Akō) of West Japan Railway Company.\n\nIn a 2014 soundtrack album of Ressha Sentai ToQger, the singer Shōgō Kamata recorded a variation of the song with Animetal USA rearranging the song.\n\n\"The Eyes of Texas\" is the spirit song of the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Texas at El Paso. It is set to the tune of \"I've Been Working on the Railroad\" with alternate lyrics written in 1904. Students, faculty, staff, and alumni of the University sing the song at Longhorn sports games and other events.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2321950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321950", "title": "Garfield High School (Seattle)", "text": "Garfield High School (Seattle)\n\nJames A. Garfield High School is a public high school in the Seattle Public Schools district of Seattle, Washington, United States. Located along 23rd Avenue between E. Alder and E. Jefferson Streets in Seattle's urban Central District, Garfield draws students from all over the city. Garfield is also one of two options for the district's Highly Capable Cohort for academically highly gifted students, with the other being Ingraham International School. As a result, it has many college-level classes available ranging from calculus-based physics to Advanced Placement (AP) studio art.\n\nJames A. Garfield High School was founded in 1923 as East High School at its current location. The first graduating class consisted of only 282 students who transferred from Broadway High School. In three years, the school's enrollment forced the 12-room building to be scrapped for the Jacobean-style building designed by Floyd Naramore.\nIn 1929, the city commissioned the architect to design an addition for the school as enrollment peaked at 2,300 students.\n\nGarfield High School has long played a key role in its neighborhood, and because the Central District has changed, so has the school's population. In its early decades, the school was noted for its Jewish, Japanese and Italian populations. After World War II, the neighborhood became predominantly African-American and by 1961, 51 percent of Garfield students were black, compared to only 5.3 percent of the general Seattle school district population. In the late 1960s and 1970s, Garfield was at the center of the school district's attempts to avoid forced busing through various plans, including turning it into a \"magnet\" school. This began the focus on music and science that persist to the present day. The school introduced an APP Program in 1979, and due to the success of this program, an alternative program, IBx, was opened for APP students at Ingraham International High School in North Seattle to help relieve pressure on an overcrowded Garfield.\n\nNotable people who have spoken at Garfield include Martin Luther King Jr. and Jesse Jackson. Civil rights activist Stokely Carmichael spoke at the school in 1967. Future President Barack Obama gave a speech in 2006 regarding \"Innovation in Education\".\n\nDuring a 2012 school field trip, one of the school's students allegedly raped another student. The school's mishandling of the ensuing investigation resulted in an ongoing federal investigation of the school district for Title IX sexual violence violations.\n\nThe buildings have lasted for more than eight decades, but they were partially demolished in a sweeping redesign of the school that began in June 2006. The remodel was mostly completed by the fall of 2008, making the class of 2009 the only class to attend classes in both the old and new buildings. There was a movement to hold off the remodeling to preserve the building's history, including a city initiative to preserve the Quincy Jones auditorium as a historic site, thereby blocking the remodeling. The new design has a state-of-the-art performing arts center. After its renovation, Garfield had become the second most expensive high school in the state, after Stadium High School, with Stadium High at $106 million and Garfield at $105 million.\n\nThe school reopened in time for 2008 classes on September 3. Faculty and students vacated their temporary quarters at Lincoln High School at the end of the 2007–2008 school year.\n\nGarfield High School's architecture makes extensive use of terracotta. Among the many terracotta details worked into the building are emblems of botany, the trades, arts and crafts, industry, intelligence, and the sciences.\nOf the approximately 400 students who graduated in 2011, 70 percent planned to attend four-year colleges, and 20 percent planned to attend two-year colleges. Garfield has over 200 students in IEP (Individualized Learning) and ELL (English Language Learners) programs, along with 415 APP (Accelerated Progress Program) students. The school currently offers 17 Advanced Placement and 10 honors courses. In 2012, the mean reading, math and writing SAT scores for Garfield students were 575, 578 and 569, respectively.\n\nGarfield was one of 14 schools in King County in 2007 to receive the \"School of Distinction\" award from the office of superintendent of public instruction for making the most progress over six years in reading and writing on the WASL. The school also had a silver medal of distinction from \"U.S. News and World Report\" in 2008 and 2009 for being among the top-performing high schools in terms of college readiness. The school is noted for producing a number of National Merit Scholars each year, and Garfield consistently produces more National Merit Scholars each year than any other public school in Washington state. Garfield frequently competes for the highest number of National Merit Scholars of any school in the state, including private schools. Garfield students make up more than 70 percent of the Seattle Public School students who take AP exams.\n\nEach year there are dozens of valedictorians, most of whom go on to the top universities. In June 2005, 44 valedictorians graduated. In recent years, however, the school has faced widespread complaints that white students are served through AP and honors programs, and black students are not supported. During the 2006–2007 school year Garfield offered more than 120 different classes across nine departments, including an extensive selection of advanced classes. Garfield students can take classes from local community colleges through a program called Running Start, and online courses from Stanford's EPGY and Johns Hopkins University's CTY program. Some students attend on-campus courses at the University of Washington.\n\nIn January 2013, the entire teaching body of Garfield High School refused to administer the standardized Measures of Academic Progress, or MAP, which is administered system-wide, three times per year. The teachers called the tests useless and a waste of instructional time. After their protest became public, teachers at local schools nearby such as Ballard High School and Chief Sealth International High School joined the movement. The American Federation of Teachers has endorsed the school's boycott of the tests.\n\nGarfield athletics have been strong historically. Athletic successes for the 1950s included four city football championships, two tennis titles, two baseball championships, and a state AA tournament trophy in basketball. The boys basketball team has won the most state Washington state championships in state history.\n\nGarfield basketball teams have won many regional and state titles. The boys basketball team has won the state championship 14 times and was the runner-up eight times since 1949. The team has notable alumni, including Brandon Roy (GHS c/o 2002), Tony Wroten (GHS c/o 2011), and University of Washington alumnus Will Conroy. The girls team boasts alumna Joyce Walker (GHS c/o 1980), who is best known as the third woman to join the Harlem Globetrotters. Both the girls and boys teams were state champions in 1980 and 1987. The girls team won their third state championship in 2005.\n\nIn 2001, the boys swimming and diving team won the state championship. In 2007, the girls swimming and diving team won the state championship.\n\nGarfield won state titles in boys and girls track in 1987 and 2017. The boys cross country team won the Metro League championship in 2016.\n\nThe football team made national headlines when the entire team kneeled during the U.S. national anthem, due to negative encounters with law enforcement and a supposed racist verse in the anthem for the entirety of the 2016 season . Players on the team stated that they had received death threats and had their car's tires slashed due to the protests .\n\nFamous Bulldog alumni also include Olympic gold medalist Debbie Armstrong, who won the giant slalom at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo.\n\nIn 2005, Garfield's performance of \"Cabaret\" won the Outstanding Program and Poster Design award and Special Honors in Educational Impact and Student Achievement from the 5th Avenue Theatre. Subsequent musicals have been unable to enter the 5th Avenue Awards due to scheduling. One of the main draws of Garfield's drama program is its large student-led Drama Club, an important element that is missing from many other local area schools. The Garfield Drama Club produces collections of short one-act plays, and a main stage Autumn Show every year, all of which are directed and produced by current students. The department also performs two teacher-directed shows per year: a Children's Show for local elementary schools, and a Spring Musical.\n\n\"The Messenger\" is Garfield's monthly student-run newspaper. \"The Messenger\" has earned awards from the Journalism Education Association and the National Scholastic Press Association: placing in Best of Show in the JEA/NSPA Spring National High School Journalism Conventions and winning its most prestigious honor, the Pacemaker Award, in 1997 and 2006. A column from the paper was reprinted by \"All About Jazz\" in 2004.\nIn 2006 and 2007, staff reporters won the NSPA's Brasler Prize.\n\nGarfield remains one of the last two public schools in the Seattle metropolitan area that offers Latin. The Latin language club is affiliated with the National Junior Classical League and remains one of the largest local chapters. Garfield students score highly on the National Latin exam as well, with more than half of the Latin students receiving golds (top 10 percent in the world) for several consecutive years. Other languages offered include Spanish, French and Japanese.\n\nGarfield has two \"FIRST\" Tech Challenge robotics teams: team 4042, Nonstandard Deviation and team 12788, Ultraviolet. Team 4042 was founded in 2009, and received the Rockwell Collins Innovate award at the 2018 West-Super Regional Championship and Washington State Championship, ultimately attending the Houston FIRST Championship in April 2018.\n\nThe music program at Garfield High School has won numerous awards. Several notable musicians attended the school, including Jimi Hendrix, Lil Tracy, Quincy Jones, Macklemore, and Ernestine Anderson.\n\nThe choirs at Garfield include a Treble Choir, Concert Choir and a Vocal Jazz group. In 2009, the vocal jazz ensemble received a special commendation for its performance at Lionel Hampton.\n\nThe orchestra program includes a symphony orchestra, a concert orchestra, and a chamber music program. Every year, many students from the orchestra play in the Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestras, often in principal positions. Garfield students also play in the Seattle Conservatory of Music Starling Scholar Chamber Orchestra, and many community ensembles. Garfield orchestra members have had their original compositions debuted by the Seattle Symphony and SYSO. In 1995, Garfield guest conductor Gerard Schwarz, music director of the Seattle Symphony, said, \"I don’t recall hearing a high school orchestra perform anywhere in this country on such a high level.\" Garfield has won numerous first-place awards in festivals around the world, including the Best Orchestra for Downbeat Magazine in both 1999 and 2007, and the National Orchestra Cup in 2011. The Garfield Symphony Orchestra has also toured and performed in Japan, Europe, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Carnegie Hall and Alice Tully Hall in New York.\n\nGarfield's jazz program has won state, national and international awards and accolades in big band, combo and individual categories. Jazz Ensemble I has toured Europe numerous times, visiting the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Austria, Italy, and playing at venues including the Montreux and North Sea Jazz Festivals. It has also attended the International Association of Jazz Educators' conference, as well as the Essentially Ellington Competition in New York City. It is the only band to win the first place trophy in consecutive years (2003–2004 and 2009–2010) and the only band to have been invited to Essentially Ellington for ten consecutive years. Overall showings at Essentially Ellington have included 1999 (honorable mention), 2000 (honorable mention), 2002 (2nd place), 2003 (1st place), 2004 (1st place), 2006 (3rd place), 2008 (2nd place), 2009 (1st place), 2010 (1st place), 2013 (Finalist), 2014 (Finalist), 2015 (Finalist), 2016 (Finalist), 2019 (Finalist) and 2020 (Finalist). Its consistent placement in national competitions and long history of national recognition indicate its status as one of the best high school jazz bands in the country.\n\nAmong the many other awards are seven sweepstakes wins since 2000 at the Clark College Jazz Festival (Vancouver, Washington), three sweepstakes wins (including two by Jazz Band II) at the Bellevue High School jazz festival (Bellevue, Washington), six sweepstakes awards at the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival (Moscow, Idaho), and others wins at the Reno and Mount Hood jazz festivals.\n\n\n"}

In 302 or 301 BC, shortly after having executed the young man's father and predecessor Mithridates II of Cius, the diadoch Antigonus became suspicious of the son who had inherited the family dominion of Cius, and planned to kill the boy. Mithridates, however, received from Demetrius Poliorketes timely notice of Antigonus's intentions, and fled with a few followers to Paphlagonia, where he occupied a strong fortress, called Cimiata. He was joined by numerous bodies of troops from different quarters and gradually extended his dominions in Pontus and created the foundations for the birth of a new kingdom, which may be judged to have risen about 281 BC when Mithridates assumed the title of \"basileus\" (king). In the same year, we find him concluding an alliance with the town of Heraclea Pontica in Bithynia, to protect it against Seleucus. At a subsequent period, Mithridates is found acquiring support from the Gauls (who later settled in Asia Minor) in order to overthrow a force sent against him by Ptolemy, king of Egypt. These are the recorded events of his reign, which lasted for thirty-six years. He was succeeded by his son Ariobarzanes. He seems to have been buried in a royal grave near the kingdom's capital, Amasia. Next to him would be buried all the kings of Pontus until the fall of Sinope in 183 BC.\n\nAccording to Appian, he was eighth in descent from the first satrap of Pontus under Darius the Great and sixth in ascending order from Mithridates Eupator. However, this point is controversial since Plutarch writes that eight generations of kings of Pontus stemmed from him before Roman subjection.\n\n"}

The five locations Hawaiian Falls operates are located across the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex area and Central Texas.\n\nThe Hawaiian Falls chain began with the groundbreaking of Hawaiian Falls Adventure Park in Garland, Texas on December 18, 2002, by David Busch of Horizon Family Inc., a California-based company. Mr. Busch has built and operated other water park properties in several states, including the park located on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. Hawaiian Falls' mission is: \"Serving the Lord by Bringing Families Closer Together.\" The City of Garland City Council and the Parks and Recreation Board provided the land on which the water park was built. Construction for Hawaiian Falls Garland began in January 2003 and opened in May of the same year. In late 2003 Hawaiian Falls made a similar agreement with The Colony, Texas. Also in 2003, Hawaiian Falls entered into a lease agreement with the city of Dallas to manage what would be become Bahama Beach Waterpark.\n\nIn late 2004, Busch experienced financial problems and he had to sell his company to Herschend Family Entertainment. Under the Herschend management, Busch continued to operate the waterparks.\n\nIn 2005, the Dallas aquatic center opened as Bahama Beach Waterpark in Dallas, Texas under the management of Busch once again. Bahama Beach is known as \"the first inner-city waterpark\" in the entire country since it was \"built to serve its community\" and moreover, the launch of this park was considered a risky endeavor since the waterpark was not built near a wealthier, highly populated area, which is the traditional areas that waterparks tend to be located within.\n\nIn December 2006, after Bahama Beach's second operating season, David Busch informed the city of Dallas that the park was operating at a loss of over $178,000 over the course of two years \n\"Low discretionary income in the park's market area,\" was one of the main reasons given for the loss.\nAmong other things, Busch suggested that re-branding the park to Hawaiian Falls might solve the problem. Also in 2006, Busch had repurchased his company from Hereschend Family Entertainment and sold the parks in Garland and the Colony to CNL Lifestyle Properties..\n\nIn 2007, the city of Dallas allowed the renaming of Bahama Beach to Hawaiian Falls Dallas. yet the re-branding did not sever the operations loss. This lead to the city of Dallas and Hawaiian Falls agreeing to allow the termination of the eleven-year contract with the city . Today, the park is still open today and operates under its original name, Bahama Beach.\n\nAlso in 2007, the company acquired its first non-waterpark property, Aloha Adventure Park located in Lewisville, Texas.\n\nIn 2008, the chain expanded by adding Hawaiian Falls Mansfield in Mansfield, Texas.\n\nIn late 2010, the city of Roanoke, Texas, entered into a Letter of Intent with Harvest Family Entertainment to build another Hawaiian Falls waterpark in Roanoke. They later broke ground on November 22, 2010. Hawaiian Falls Roanoke opened Memorial Day weekend 2011 with the Mega WaterWorld attraction, the World's largest water playground.\n\nIn October 2011, Hawaiian Falls entered into an agreement with the city of Waco to take over the former Waco City Water Park and transformed it into the new Hawaiian Falls Waco, which opened Memorial Day weekend 2012.\n\nIn December 2011, Hawaiian Falls announced plans for a $2 million expansion for the Roanoke waterpark and another $4.3 million in expansions for the other three North Texas parks to be completed by Memorial Day 2012.\n\nFor the 2014 season, Hawaiian Falls opened two new locations in Pflugerville and White Settlement, Texas. Each of the new parks featured an adventure park that were projected to be open year-round. On August 6, 2013, the city of Pflugerville agreed on a development deal with Harvest Family Entertainment to build the sixth and largest Hawaiian Falls water park just south of the intersection of Texas State Highway 130 and Texas State Highway 45 in the city. The plan for the Pflugerville location consisted of a 15-acre water park along with a 5-acre adventure park, the largest water park in the company. In early November 2013, the city of White Settlement finalized with Hawaiian Falls to build their seventh location in the city in western Tarrant County, Texas where it features an adventure park, water park, event center, and an arcade center near Interstate 820. Both Pflugerville and White Settlement locations opened in summer 2014.\n\nBusch promised the city of Pflugerville “year-round revenue,\" stating, \"We will fill that place up all winter long.\" The adventure park did not prove viable enough to stay open through the coldest winter months, and Hawaiian Falls closed the adventure parks in White Settlement and Pflugerville in December 2014 until spring 2015. Eight year-round employees at Pflugerville were let go. Austin television news station KXAN ran a story about the lay-offs in response to Facebook comments of Pflugerville residents.\n\nIn 2005 Fontana, California City Council authorized Fontana City Manager to enter into a lease agreement with Hawaiian Falls to renovate and improve the waterpark already inside the Martin Tudor Regional Park. The City Planning Commission would still need to approve the deal. Some Fontana residents supported the park, but neighbors living near the park were concerned about noise, traffic, and security issues. In 2006, the existing waterpark was closed for renovation “because the ground at the hilly location became unsettled, and as a result, cracks began to surface in the equipment”. In 2012 City reopened the renovated park without Hawaiian Falls. San Bernardino County funds and $400,000 state grant were used for the renovation. No private company seems to have been involved. Entrance is approximately $3 per person.\n\nIn May 2006 Hawaiian Falls withdrew an application submitted to city of Gilbert, Arizona to develop a Hawaiian Falls park there, saying they did not think they would be able to meet their deadlines for the project. Gilbert residents had voiced opposition to the project for over a year, citing environmental issues, and arguing that it would be a violation of the separation of church and state to allow a company who openly proselytizes in their parks to partner with the city.\n\nIn 2012 the city of Greenville Economic Development Director Greg Simms approached Hawaiian Falls about a public-private partnership to build a $12 to $14 million waterpark in that City. On November 19, 2013 Greenville City Council chose to partner with Splash Kingdom instead of Hawaiian Falls. Splash Kingdom was providing its own funding, $5 million, while Hawaiian Falls was requesting over $10 million in incentives from the city.\n\nOn April 27, 2013, Hawaiian Falls presented a public-private partnership proposal to the city of Escondido's economic development subcommittee. Hawaiian Falls proposed an 80-20 split on the construction of the proposed $13 million waterpark, with Escondido contributing $10.4 million and Hawaiian Falls contributing $2.6 million. Hawaiian Falls proposed that the park be built in the City's existing Kit Carson Park. Hawaiian Falls would pay the City 5% of the park's revenues. Escondido Mayor urged Hawaiian Falls to come back with a better deal because payment on revenue bonds used to fund the park would be at least double what Hawaiian Falls proposed paying in rent. He said Escondido would consider furnishing the land, but not the money for the construction. \nOn April 15, 2013 angry Escondido residents presented a petition to City Council opposing Hawaiian Falls’ proposal. Escondido Mayor told residents “The fact that you are here today will make sure this proposal won’t go anywhere. It will put the skids on this project.” \n\nOn April 7, 2014 the Rockwall, Texas City Council voted not to enter into the public-private partnership with Hawaiian Falls. Rockwall Mayor David Sweet told reporters, “I am very hesitant and have serious concerns about another public-private partnership involving a $25 million debt paid back over 30 years.” Mayor Sweet and city council were also concerned about water issues during a statewide drought.\n\nIn October 2013, the city of Elk Grove, California selected P3 International to design, build, and operate an Aquatic Center for the City. Hawaiian Falls was a subcontractor for P3 and would be responsible for the waterpark that was proposed as part of the Aquatic Center. On April 14, 2014 P3 International notified the City that Hawaiian Falls had withdrawn from the project. On September 10, 2014 City Council voted to build the aquatic center without a waterpark.\n\nOn June 12, 2014 Hawaiian Falls executives proposed a $20 million waterpark to the Richland County Council – Hawaiian Falls would design, build, and operate the park if the county would fund it. On June 12, 2014 County Council approved a 2% hospitality tax on prepared meals to fund a waterpark. Later in June 2014, members of the Richland County Council spent $7,560 in tax dollar to visit Hawaiian Falls parks in Texas. A request for proposals on the waterpark was issued on August 11, 2014 and closed on September 18, 2014. Plans for this project were scrapped on April 19, 2016 after the Richland County Council declined funding for the project.\n\nAll Hawaiian Falls parks are built using the public-private partnership model, where cities contribute funds and/or other incentives and the parks are built on public land. Each of the seven parks has a separate lease structure with the cities participation ranging from contributing land and infrastructure costs(Garland and The Colony)to 100% financing . The first two parks were in the city of Garland and the city of The Colony, both in Texas. The third park was located in the South Oak Cliff neighborhood of Dallas. \nBusch sees his parks as a \"mission field.\" The parks are often used for baptisms and other religious activities, and Busch says there were \"more than 2,000 baptisms in our lazy rivers and wavepools\" in 2011 alone. The parks often feature Christian concerts and events, such as \"Modesty Matters\" in 2013. Hawaiian Falls employee program is called \"Connections.\" According to Rawd B. Jones, whose company Pure Group, administers Connections, the program includes after hours Bible study and church services, as well as training on how to bring the gospel to guests.\n\nAll four of the former parks are currently operating with different owners and park names.\n\n\"Hawaiian Falls Garland\" (Also known as Hawaiian Falls Firewheel) was the first park in for the chain and officially opened on May 24, 2003, in Garland, Texas.\n\nThe waterpark sits on roughly adjacent to the Spring Creek Forest Preserve and is visible from the George Bush turnpike, which broke ground on December 18, 2002.\n\nIt consists of fifteen attractions: 11 water slides, a lazy river, an interactive water tree-house, a wave pool, and an activity pool, as well as a few food stands. The park was built for roughly $5.5 million in a public-private partnership between the city of Garland and Hawaiian Falls. In 2006 Hawaiian Falls Garland was purchased by CNL Lifestyle Properties for $6,305,000. CNL leased back the park to Horizon Family Holdings, which operated the park until ProParks Management Company took over the lease in May 2018. EPR Properties acquired the property from CNL in 2017.\n\n\n\n\"Hawaiian Falls The Colony\" the second Hawaiian Falls Water park in the Hawaiian Falls Water park chain and officially opened in May 2004 in The Colony, Texas.\n\nIt consists of fifteen attractions: 11 water slides, a lazy river, an interactive water tree-house, a wave pool, a water walkway, a private picnic area, and a private cabana area, as well as several food stands. The park was built by David Busch of Horizon Family, Inc., (now Hawaiian Falls Water parks), and is a joint public/private venture with the city of The Colony, TX. In 2006 Hawaiian Falls The Colony was purchased from Horizon Family Holdings by CNL Lifestyle Properties for $5.82 million. CNL leased back the park to Horizon Family Holdings, which operated the park until ProParks Management Company took over the lease in May 2018. EPR Properties acquired the property from CNL in 2017.\n\n\n\n\"Hawaiian Falls Mansfield\" is located in Mansfield, Texas, which was announced on September 10, 2007, and opened on Memorial Day Weekend in May 2008.\n\nThe water park sits on on Heritage Parkway and Texas State Highway 360.\n\nIt consists of 14 water slides, a lazy river, an interactive water tree-house, a football-field size wave pool, and a children's activity pool, a private cabana area, as well as a few food stands. The park cost roughly $10 million and was built by David Busch of Hawaiian Falls Water parks in a joint public/private venture with the city of Mansfield. Hawaiian Falls Water parks signed a 40-year lease with the city of Mansfield to operate the park.\n\n\n\n\"Hawaiian Falls Roanoke\" is located in Roanoke, Texas. The park was announced on November 22, 2010, and opened on Memorial Day weekend of 2011.\n\nIt became home of the world's largest aqua play structure which will include a three-lane racer, a family raft ride with several exciting body slides, one 500-gallon and one 1,000-gallon dump bucket, numerous interactive pulleys, wheels and much more. Ground broke for Hawaiian Falls Roanoke on November 22, 2010.\n\n\n\n\"Hawaiian Falls Waco\" is located in Waco, Texas. The park is the fifth and most recent addition to the Hawaiian Falls Water park chain. It was originally known as the Waco Water Park until October 2011 when Hawaiian Falls and the city of Waco agreed to a takeover. Three times its original size, it reopened as Hawaiian Falls Waco on May 26, 2012.\n\nThe park sits on approximately 14 acres of land. As of 2019, the park had 12 slides, 3 restaurants and 1 gift shop. It is known for its \"Breaker Bay\" family wave pool, the first large-scale wave pool in central Texas, and the 800-foot long \"Kona Kooler\" lazy river.\n\n"}
{"id": "2321972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321972", "title": "Inter Ice Age 4", "text": "Inter Ice Age 4\n\nInter Ice Age 4 (第四間氷期, \"Dai-Yon Kampyōki\") is an early science fiction novel by Japanese writer Kōbō Abe originally serialized in the journal \"Sekai\" from 1958 to 1959 and first translated into English by American scholar E. Dale Saunders in 1970.\n\nPlot elements include submersion of the world caused by melting polar ice, genetic creation of gilled children for the coming underwater age, and a fortune-telling computer predicting the future and advising humans how to deal with it. Because a similar computer in Moscow is being used to make political forecasts, the institute of a Tokyo professor decides to avoid politics and try to foresee the future of an individual. A man is picked, apparently at random, only to be murdered before he can be programmed, but the computer can still read his mind. The resulting involvements are complicated by a climatic shift – Inter Ice Age 4 – that puts Earth underwater.\n\nIn the third edition of \"The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\", author and critic John Clute writes of \"Inter Ice Age 4\": \"It is a complex story set in a near-future Japan threatened by the melting polar ice caps. The protagonist, Professor Katsumi, has been in charge of developing a computer/information system capable of predicting human behavior. Fatally for him, this system predicts his compulsive refusal to go along with his associates and his government in the creation of genetically engineered children, adapted for life in the rising seas. Most of the novel, narrated by Katsumi, deals with a philosophical confrontation between his deeply alienated refusal of the future and the computer's knowing representations of that refusal and the alternatives to it. The resulting psychodramas include a mysterious murder and the enlistment of his unborn child into the ranks of the mutated water-breathers.\"\n\nIn his \"Visual Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\", British author and critic Brian Ash calls the English translation of the novel \"flat\" and \"featureless\", but notes that this \"could not smother the miracle of [Abe's] use of biology to attack racism at its very root, asking what will be our attitudes to those whom we ourselves design for life in alien habitats?\"\n\nScholar Robert L. Trent writes of the novel's themes: \"Genetic engineering succeeds in creating an aquatic human, but people feel the sapping of their own sense of identity as people, since after the flood, only the aquatic humans will be 'people'. As one can see, the crisis of alienation and the crisis of identity are great concerns of Abe Kobo.\"\n\nIn his introduction to a pair of Abe's essays published in the November, 2002 issue of \"Science Fiction Studies\", Christopher Bolton writes: \"Abe's work in the 1950s included short stories about robots, suspended animation, and alien visitation, but it was the 1959 publication of his novel \"Dai yon kanpyôki\" (\"Inter Ice Age 4\", 1970) that marked a real turning point for SF in Japan. Incorporating hard-science elements on a scale that no Japanese novelist had attempted, Abe nevertheless pushed the story toward a disturbing, almost surreal conclusion. A number of critics have identified \"Inter Ice Age 4\" as Japan's first full-length science fiction novel, and a work that helped jump start Japanese interest in the genre.\"\n\n\n"}

The main commercial mall being built this year is named after him: The \"Arcades Rougé\".\n\nDuring the early years of the French revolutionary wars, the town found itself at the heart of the counter-revolutionary struggle in the Vendée, culminating in October 1793 with the Battle of Cholet which was won by the republicans and followed by a period of brutal government repression.\n\nCholet hosted Stage 4 (Individual Time Trial) and was the departure of Stage 5 in the 2008 Tour de France.

The second and third chapters in this film trilogy were re-edited in 2006 into an FX-heavy \"special edition\" entitled \"Mutation: Annihilation\".\n\nA large majority of his earlier FX work was done by German director/effects technician and close friend Olaf Ittenbach, although Rose currently does most of his own under his \"Rosecalypse SFX\" banner.\n\nSubstantially younger than many of his contemporaries, Rose bases much of his filmmaking on the brutality of early Andreas Schnaas and Olaf Ittenbach features. In the decade since he began creating films, he has directed more features than any other filmmakers in the German movie scene.\n\nSince his 2004 film \"Lord of the Undead\", starring Debbie Rochon, Rose has made it a point to film at least a portion of each of his films in English. Many of his more recent films, such as \"Barricade\", \"Fearmakers\", and \"Beast\", have been shot primarily in English, with minimal German interspersed throughout.\n\nRose's films are heavily influenced by modern, hyperkinetic action movies and video games.

The objective of the game is for each team to destroy their opponents' Ancient, a heavily guarded structure at the opposing corner of the map, which is based on the \"Aeon of Strife\" map for \"StarCraft\". Players use powerful units known as heroes, and are assisted by allied teammates and AI-controlled fighters. As in role-playing games, players level up their heroes and use gold to buy equipment during the mission.\n\nThe scenario was developed with the \"World Editor\" of \"Reign of Chaos\", and was updated upon the release of its expansion, \"The Frozen Throne\". There have been many variations of the original concept, the most popular being \"DotA Allstars\", eventually simplified to \"DotA\". The mod has been maintained by several authors during development, with the pseudonymous designer, known as IceFrog, maintaining the game since the mid-2000s.\n\n\"DotA\" became a feature at several worldwide tournaments, including Blizzard Entertainment's BlizzCon and the Asian World Cyber Games. Critical reception to \"DotA\" was positive, with it being called one of the most popular mods of any game. \"DotA\" is largely attributed as being the most significant inspiration for the MOBA genre. American video game developer Valve acquired the intellectual property rights to \"DotA\" in 2009 to develop a franchise, beginning with the standalone sequel, \"Dota 2\", released in July 2013.\n\n\"Defense of the Ancients\" pits two teams of players against each other: the Sentinel and the Scourge. Players on the Sentinel team are based at the southwest corner of the map, and those on the Scourge team are based at the northeast corner. Each base is defended by towers and waves of units which guard the main paths leading to their base. In the center of each base is the \"Ancient\", a building that must be destroyed to win the game.\n\nEach human player controls one hero, a powerful unit with unique abilities. In \"DotA\", players on each side choose one of 112 heroes, each with different abilities and tactical advantages over other heroes. The scenario is highly team-oriented; it is difficult for one player to carry the team to victory alone. \"DotA\" allows up to ten players in a five-versus-five format.\n\nBecause the gameplay revolves around strengthening individual heroes, it does not require focus on resource management and base-building, unlike most traditional real-time strategy games. Killing computer-controlled or neutral units earns the player experience points; the player gains a level when enough experience is accumulated. Leveling up improves the hero's toughness and the damage they inflict, and allows players to upgrade spells or skills. In addition to accumulating experience, players also manage a single resource of gold. The typical resource-gathering of \"Warcraft III\" is replaced by a combat-oriented money system; in addition to a small periodic income, heroes earn gold by killing or destroying hostile units, base structures, and enemy heroes. This has caused emphasis on a technique called \"last-hitting,\" which is when the player attacks a hostile unit when \"its hit points are low enough to kill it with one blow\". Using gold, players buy items to strengthen their hero and gain abilities; certain items can be combined with recipes to create more powerful items. Buying items that suit one's hero is an important tactical element of the mod.\n\n\"DotA\" offers a variety of game modes, selected by the game host at the beginning of the match. The game modes dictate the difficulty of the scenario, as well as whether players can choose their hero or are assigned one randomly. Many game modes can be combined, allowing more flexible options.\n\n\"\" is the third title in the \"Warcraft\" series of real-time strategy games developed by Blizzard Entertainment. As with \"\", Blizzard included a free \"world editor\" in the game that allows players to create custom scenarios or \"maps\" for the game, which can be played online with other players through Battle.net. These custom scenarios can be simple terrain changes, which play like normal \"Warcraft\" games, or they can be entirely new game scenarios with custom objectives, units, items, and events, like \"Defense of the Ancients\".\n\nThe first version of \"Defense of the Ancients\" was released in 2003 by Kyle Sommer who goes by the alias Eul. The map was based on a previous \"StarCraft\" scenario known as \"Aeon of Strife\". After the release of \"Warcraft\"s expansion \"The Frozen Throne\", which added new features to the World Editor, Eul did not update the scenario. Other mapmakers produced spinoffs that added new heroes, items, and features. Among the \"DotA\" variants created in the wake of Eul's map, there was \"DotA Allstars\", originally created and developed by custom map makers Meian and Ragn0r, who took the most popular heroes and compiled them into one map. In March 2004, map maker Guinsoo (real name Steve Feak) took control of development. Feak said when he began developing \"DotA Allstars\", he had no idea how popular the game would eventually become; the emerging success of the gametype inspired him to design a new title around what he considered an emerging game genre. Feak added a recipe system for items so that player's equipment would scale as they grew more powerful, as well as a powerful boss character called Roshan (named after his bowling ball) who required an entire team to defeat.\n\nFeak used a battle.net chat channel as a place for \"DotA\" players to congregate, but \"DotA Allstars\" had no official site for discussions and hosting. Subsequently, the leaders of the \"DotA Allstars\" clan, TDA, proposed that a dedicated web site be created to replace the various online alternatives that were infrequently updated or improperly maintained. TDA member Steve \"Pendragon\" Mescon created an official community site, dota-allstars.com.\n\nTowards the end of his association with the map in 2005, Feak handed over control to another developer. The new author, IceFrog, added new features, heroes, and fixes. IceFrog was at one time highly reclusive, refusing to give interviews; the only evidence of his authorship was the map maker's email account on the official website and the name branded on the game's loading screen. IceFrog later interacted with players through a personal blog where he answered common questions players have about him and about the game.\n\n\"Defense of the Ancients\" is maintained via official forums. Users can post ideas for new heroes or items, some of which are added to the map. Players have contributed icons and hero descriptions and created the artwork displayed while the map loads, and suggestions for changes to existing heroes or items are taken seriously; IceFrog once changed a new hero less than two weeks after the new version of the map was released. Versions of the scenario where enemy heroes are controlled by artificial intelligences have also been released. Mescon continued to maintain dota-allstars.com, which by the end of IceFrog's affiliation in May 2009 had over 1,500,000 registered users and had received over one million unique visitors every month. Due to their separation, IceFrog announced that he would be further developing a new official site, playdota.com, while continuing game development; Mescon closed dota-allstars on July 22, 2010, citing dropping statistics and his new passion for \"League of Legends\" as the reason for its end.\n\nBecause \"Warcraft III\" custom games have none of the features designed to improve game quality (matchmaking players based on connection speed, etc.), various programs are used to maintain \"Defense of the Ancients\". External tools ping player's locations, and games can be named to exclude geographic regions. Clans and committees such as TDA maintain their own official list of rules and regulations, and players can be kicked from matches by being placed on \"banlists\". While increasingly popular, \"DotA Allstars\" remained limited as a custom map in \"Warcraft III\", relying on manual matchmaking, updates, and containing no tutorials.\n\nThe popularity of \"Defense of the Ancients\" increased over time. The scenario was featured by \"Computer Gaming World\" in a review of new maps and mods in \"Warcraft III\". \"DotA Allstars\" became an important tournament scenario, starting with its prominence at the debut of Blizzard's BlizzCon convention in 2005. \"DotA Allstars\" was also featured in the Malaysia and Singapore World Cyber Games starting in 2005, and the World Cyber Games Asian Championships beginning with the 2006 season. \"Defense of the Ancients\" was included in the game lineup for the internationally recognized Cyberathlete Amateur League and CyberEvolution leagues. Additionally, the scenario appeared in Electronic Sports World Cup (ESWC) 2008; Oliver Paradis, ESWC's competition manager, noted that the high level of community support behind the scenario, as well as its worldwide appeal, were among the reasons it was chosen.\n\nThe scenario is popular in many parts of the world; in the Philippines and Thailand, it is played as much as the game \"Counter-Strike\". It is also popular in Sweden and other Northern European countries, where the \"Defense of the Ancients\"-inspired song \"Vi sitter i Ventrilo och spelar DotA\" by Swedish musician Basshunter cracked the top ten Singles Charts in Sweden, Norway, and Finland. LAN tournaments were a major part of worldwide play, including tournaments in Sweden and Russia; however, due to a lack of LAN tournaments and championships in North America, several teams disbanded. Blizzard pointed to DotA as an example of what dedicated mapmakers can create using developer's tools.\n\nMichael Walbridge, writing for Gamasutra in 2008, stated that \"DotA\" \"is likely the most popular and most-discussed free, non-supported game mod in the world\". In pointing to the strong community built around the game, Walbridge stated that \"DotA\" showed it is much easier for a community game to be maintained by the community, and this is one of the maps' greatest strengths. Former game journalist Luke Smith called \"DotA\" \"the ultimate RTS\".\n\n\"Defense of the Ancients\" helped spur the development of the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) genre. It was one of the influences for the 2009 Gas Powered Games title \"Demigod\", with the video game publication GameSpy noting the game's premise revolved around aspiring gods \"[playing] \"DotA\" in real life\". Guinsoo went on to apply many of the mechanics and lessons he learned from \"Defense of the Ancients\" to the Riot Games title \"League of Legends\". Other \"\"DotA\" clones\" include S2 Games' \"Heroes of Newerth\". Blizzard Entertainment also developed a game inspired by \"DotA\" titled \"Heroes of the Storm\", which features an array of heroes from Blizzard's franchises, including numerous original heroes from \"Warcraft III.\" The MOBA design \"DotA\" popularized also made its way into games that deviated from the mod's top-down perspective, such as third-person shooters and platformers.\n\nIn October 2009, IceFrog was hired by Valve to lead a team to develop the stand-alone sequel, \"Dota 2\". The game follows heavily in the gameplay style of \"DotA\", with aesthetics and heroes working mostly as direct ports to the original mod. In addition to the pre-conceived gameplay constants, \"Dota 2\" also features Steam support and profile tracking, intended to emphasize and support the game's matchmaking and community. The marketing and trademark of \"Dota\" as a franchise by Valve faced opposition from the \"DotA Allstars\" contributors working at Riot Games, as well as Blizzard Entertainment, both of which legally challenged the franchising of \"Dota\" by Valve. The legal dispute was conceded in May 2012, with Valve gaining franchising rights for commercial use to the trademark, while non-commercial use remains open to the public. \"Dota 2\" was officially released in July 2013.\n\n"}

Since 1519, his appanages included Volokolamsk and Staritsa.\n\nWhen his elder brother Vasily III ascended the throne, Andrey was just 14. Like his other brothers, he was forbidden to marry until Vasily could produce an heir. This didn't come to pass until 1530, but it was only two years later, when Vasily's second son was born, that Andrey was finally allowed to find himself a wife. Several months later, on February 2, 1533, he married a Gedyminid Princess, Euphrosinia Andreyevna Khovanskaya. Their only child, Vladimir, was born later that year.\n\nNext month, however, Vasily died. After 40 days of mourning, Andrey applied to his widow Elena Glinskaya for extension of his demesnes. Elena denied him that favour and Andrey departed for Staritsa in anger. There he heard that his only living brother, Yury Ivanovich, had been taken to prison and died there. It is only natural that he declined Elena's emphatic invitations to visit Moscow and lived in Staritsa in seclusion for three following years. He built there a fine cathedral, which still stands.\n\nIn 1537, however, it was rumoured that Andrey was going to escape to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Upon hearing the news, Elena closed the Lithuanian border and dispatched her minion, Prince Obolensky, to seize him. Andrey escaped to Novgorod, where he persuaded local nobility to join his cause. Reluctant to appeal to arms, however, he surrendered to the mercy of Obolensky. At Moscow, he was tried and thrown into prison with all his family. He died several months later and was succeeded in Staritsa by his son Vladimir.\n"}

Underground churches came into existence in the 1950s, after the communist party's establishment of the People's Republic of China, due to the severing of ties between Chinese Catholics and the Holy See.\n\nThere continues to be tensions between underground churches and \"open churches\" which have joined the state-sanctioned Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association ().\n\nThe description of an \"underground church\" reflects language that was made popular during the Cold War, when these churches came about. Underground churches are also sometimes referred to as \"Vatican loyalists\" because they have attempted to remain loyal to the Pope and the Holy See. There is no established organization structure of underground churches, though they tend to be clustered around a number of Vatican-ordained bishops. However, underground churches would in 1989 form the Bishops Conference of Mainland China () as separate from the state-sanctioned (), which was established in 1980.\n\nChinese Catholics associated with underground churches are often seen in contrast with the Chinese Catholics associated with the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, often termed \"open churches\" (), which are officially independent of the Holy See.\n\nProtestant churches in China which have not jointed the state-sanctioned Protestant church, the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, are generally termed house churches rather than underground churches.\n\nUnderground churches in China are considered illegal, although smaller groups of fewer than 5 members are sometimes tolerated by the government.\n\nChinese Patriotic Catholic Association and (BCCC) are often used by the government to oppress underground churches throughout China.\n\nThe underground churches used to be supported by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong during the term of Joseph Zen.\n\nIt is not unusual that Chinese Catholics attending underground churches get arrested, detained without trial, even tortured.

{"id": "2322041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322041", "title": "Alcohol advertising", "text": "Alcohol advertising\n\nAlcohol advertising is the promotion of alcoholic beverages by alcohol producers through a variety of media. Along with tobacco advertising, alcohol advertising is one of the most highly regulated forms of marketing. Some or all forms of alcohol advertising is banned in some countries. There have been some important studies about alcohol advertising published, such as J.P. Nelson's in 2000.\n\nScientific research, health agencies and universities have, over the decades, been able to demonstrate a correlation between alcohol beverage advertising and alcohol consumption, especially among initially non-drinking youth. However, there is an equally significant body of research positing that alcohol advertising does not \"cause\" higher consumption and rather merely reflects greater public demand, with many commentators suggesting that effective alcohol campaigns only increase a producer's market share and also brand loyalty.\n\nThe alcohol industry has tried to actively mislead the public about the risk of cancer due to alcohol consumption, in addition to campaigning to remove laws that require alcoholic beverages to have cancer warning labels.\n\nThe intended audience of the alcohol advertising campaigns have changed over the years, with some brands being specifically targeted towards a particular demographic. Some drinks are traditionally seen as a male drink, particularly beers. Some brands have allegedly been specifically developed to appeal to people that would not normally drink that kind of beverage. These ads may contribute to underage consumption and binge drinking. In 2011 a study found that twenty-two percent of twelfth graders had binge drank in the past two weeks, this figure doubled for kids in college. Studies suggest that the use of alcohol before the brain fully develops can alter or negatively affect the development of the brain.\n\nOne area in which the alcohol industry has faced criticism and tightened legislation is in their alleged targeting of young people. Central to this is the development of alcopops – sweet-tasting, brightly coloured drinks with names that may appeal to a younger audience. Academics have found that the main factor influencing youth consumption of alcopops was taste, and that young non-drinkers and experimental drinkers were heavily influenced by advertising.\n\nThere have been several disputes over whether alcohol advertisements are targeting teens. There happens to be heavy amounts of alcohol advertising that appears to make drinking fun and exciting. Alcohol advertisements can be commonly seen in virtually any medium, they are especially known for sponsoring sporting events, concerts, magazines, and they are widely found on the internet. Most of the vendors' websites require an age of 21 to enter, but there is no restriction besides simply entering a birth date. A study done by the American Journal of Public Health concluded that Boston train passengers between the ages of 11 and 18 saw an alcohol-related advertisement everyday. There have been studies similar to this, which supports the allegation that underage consumption of alcohol is in correlation with the exposure of alcohol ads. In response, many cities have recognized the effect of alcohol-related ads on adolescents and in some cities these advertisements have been banned on public transportation.\n\nPeter Anderson and his colleagues performed longitudinal studies and concluded that \"alcohol advertising and promotion increases the likelihood that adolescents will start to use alcohol, and to drink more if they are already using alcohol.\" Elizabeth D. Waiters, Andrew J. Treno, and Joel W. Grube's discussions with a sample of youth, ages 9–15, support this claim. They found that these youth saw the purpose of beer commercials is to urge people to buy the product based on not only its quality, but also on \"its relationship to sexual attractiveness.\" They see the \"attractive young adults drink beer to personally rewarding ends\" and the \"youth-oriented music\" and are influenced to drink alcohol.\n\nThe National Household Survey on Drug Abuse reports the rates of binge alcohol use in 2008 were 1.5 percent among 12 or 13 years old, 6.9 percent among 14 or 15 years old, 17.2 percent among 16 or 17 years old, 33.7 percent among persons aged 18 to 20. In 2009, the rates for each group of underage alcohol usage increased by a fourth.\n\nAccording to 2001 College Alcohol Study (CAS), continuous alcohol promotions and advertisements including lowering prices on certain types of alcohol on a college campus have increased the percentage of alcohol consumption of that college community. Alcohol advertising on college campuses have also shown to increase binge drinking among students. However, it is concluded that the consistency of these special promotions and ads could also be useful in reducing binge drinking and other related drinking problems on campus. (Kuo, 2000, Wechsler 2000, Greenberg 2000, Lee 2000).\n\nResearch clearly indicates that, in addition to parents and peers, alcohol advertising and marketing significantly affect youth decisions to drink. (The Center on Alcohol Marketing and Youth [CAMY]).\n\n\"While many factors may influence an underage person's drinking decisions, including among other things parents, peers and the media, there is reason to believe that advertising also plays a role.\" (Federal Trade Commission, Self-Regulation in the Alcohol Industry, 1999)\n\nParents and peers substantially affect youth decisions to drink. However, research clearly indicates that alcohol advertising and marketing also have a significant effect by influencing youth and adult expectations and attitudes, and helping to create an environment that promotes underage drinking.\n\nEven though people these days must put themselves into that situation, David H. Jernigan (2005: 314) underlines how \"more than fifteen percent of twelve-year-olds will be likely to create the situation where youth are more likely per capita to see the magazine than adults over twenty-one years, the legal drinking age in the United States\".\n\nThe target market for malt liquor in the United States has been among the African-American and Hispanic populations in cities. Advertisers use themes of power and sexual dominance to appeal to customers. Critics have objected to ads targeting this segment of the population, which suffers disproportionately high rates of alcohol-related illness and poor access to medical care.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has specified that the advertising and promotion of alcohol needs to be controlled. In September 2005, the WHO Euro Region adopted a Framework for Alcohol Policy for the Region. This has 5 ethical principles which includes \"All children and adolescents have the right to grow up in an environment protected from the negative consequences of alcohol consumption and, to the extent possible, from the promotion of alcoholic beverages\".\n\nCross-border television advertising within the European Union was previously regulated by the 1989 Television without Frontiers Directive, a harmonisation measure designed to remove barriers to international trade as part of the common market. Article 15 of this Directive sets out the restrictions on alcohol advertising:\n\nThis article on alcohol advertising restrictions is implemented in each EU country largely through the self-regulatory bodies dealing with advertising.\n\nThe EU law 'TV without Frontiers' Directive has subsequently been expanded to cover new media formats such as digital television. Now called the 'Audiovisual Media Services Directive', the provisions regarding restrictions on alcohol advertising are laid out in Article 22 and are identical to the above.\n\nSome countries, such as France, Norway, Russia, Ukraine, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Kenya have banned all alcohol advertising on television and billboard.\n\nIn the United States, spirits advertising has self-regulatory bodies that create standards for the ethical advertising of alcohol. The special concern is where advertising is placed.\n\nCurrently, the standard is that alcohol advertisements can only be placed in media where 70% of the audience is over the legal drinking age. Alcohol advertising's creative messages should not be designed to appeal to people under the age of 21, for example, using cartoon characters as spokespeople is discouraged. Advertising cannot promote brands based on alcohol content or its effects. Advertising must not encourage irresponsible drinking. Another issue in media placement is whether media vendors will accept alcohol advertising. The decision to accept an individual ad or a category of advertising is always at the discretion of the owner or publisher of a media outlet.\n\nIn 1991, U.S. Surgeon General Antonia Novello criticized alcoholic beverage companies for \"unabashedly targeting teenagers\" with \"sexual imagery, cartoons, and rock and rap music\" in television and print ads. The Federal Trade Commission conducted an investigation in 2002 into possible targeting to those under the age of 21. However, this investigation and those of some scholars have not found evidence of such targeting. Concerns exist that irresponsible advertising practices or \"pushing the envelope\" with audience composition may lead to permanent legislation governing the advertising of beverage alcohol.\n\nIn Malaysia, alcohol advertising on radio and televisions was outlawed in 1995. On Malaysian television, alcohol advertising is not shown before 10:00 pm and during Malay-language programs. However, non-Malay newspapers and magazines are allowed to continue alcohol advertising. Supermarkets and hypermarkets have also been criticized for advertising alcohol products on trolleys, which is controversial because Islam is the state religion of the country. After the ban of alcohol advertising on Malaysian radio and televisions, they continued to build the brands with sponsorships of concerts and entertainment events.\n\nIn Singapore, alcohol advertisement is not allowed to be shown during programmes intended for children and young persons and during Malay-language programmes.\n\nIn Indonesia, alcohol advertising was legal in the 1990s, but have since been completely banned.\n\nIn Hong Kong, alcohol advertising is not allowed to be shown during Family Viewing Hour programmes.\n\nIn the Philippines, alcohol advertising is allowed. Alcohol warning is also shown in the end of the advertisement explaining with the words: \"Drink Moderately\". On 1 January 2016, the warning was changed to \"Drink Responsibly\".\n\nIn Thailand, alcohol advertisements are still allowed, but must accompanied by a warning message. See Alcohol advertising in Thailand.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, public advertising on alcohol is banned totally since 2006.\n\nIn South Korea, public advertising on alcohol is only allowed after 10:00 pm.\n\nIn Russia, advertising alcohol products is banned from almost all media (including television and billboards) since January 2013. Before that, alcohol advertising was restricted from using images of people drinking since mid-2000s.\n\nIn Sweden, since 2010 advertisements are legal for wine and beer, but not on television and radio. Non-periodic magazines are allowed to advertise alcoholic beverages above 15%. These advertisements must contain warnings, but which are worded less strongly than the warnings on tobacco products - for example, \"Avoid drinking while pregnant,\" as opposed to \"smoking kills.\" These rules were introduced into the law 2010 based on the provisions of an EU directive, provisionally applied by Swedish newspapers since 2005. Before that alcohol advertisements were forbidden, except for \"class 1 beer\" or \"light beer.\" Such advertisements were common, as stronger beers which shared a name with advertised light beers, may have benefit from this.\n\nIn Finland, Parliament of Finland decided to ban alcohol outdoor advertising, except during sport events. This new law is going to take place in January 2015.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Advertising Standards Authority have banned several ads that don't comply with the restrictions in the EU directive.\n\nIn Norway, Advertising on alcohol is banned totally since 1975.\n\nIn September 2017, Facebook announced it would allow users to hide all alcohol advertisements. The move is debated within the UK, as Alcohol Research UK group welcomed the change, while the Alcohol Standards Authority said the UK already had some of the strictest rules in the world.\n\nIn November 2018, Ireland introduced a law banning alcohol advertisements near schools, children play areas, public transportation, and cinemas, as well as restricting visibility of alcohol products in stores. The legislation will take effect November 2019.\n\nIn Australia the Alcoholic Beverages Advertising Code scheme regulates the marketing of alcohol. Advertisers need to follow a defined set of guidelines for showing alcohol advertisements on TV and radio. These ads are permitted from noon until 3 pm on school days and from 8.30pm to 5am every day. The ads cannot be targeted at kids and are not allowed during the broadcast of Children's (C) or Pre-school (P) classified programs on any day.\n\nMany alcohol companies create campaigns to raise awareness and/or funds for a particular charity (typically through the use of a \"ribbon\" symbol associated with a specific condition). Companies do so through alcohol products and promotions and other marketing materials. Most ribbons are not trademarked or regulated, and thus companies are able to place the image on any product.\n\nOne ribbon in particular that is recognized world-wide - the pink breast cancer ribbon - has been used by multiple alcohol companies for promotion, a practice that is known as \"pinkwashing\". Alcohol consumption has been linked to an increased risk of multiple types of cancer, one of which is breast cancer. It has been found that even low levels of alcohol consumption (1 drink per day) increases a woman's risk of developing breast cancer. A U.S. study in 2013 found that 15% of breast cancer deaths among women were attributable to alcohol.\n\nDue to this clear association, pinkwashed alcohol advertising has been criticized for promoting consumption of a product that contributes to the problem. As breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer for women, alcohol advertising that emphasizes funding to breast cancer societies may present the most harm to women, particularly when the amount of alcohol purchased is tied to the amount donated.\n\nNonetheless, many alcohol companies have donated substantial amounts to various cancer charities, which undoubtedly supports important causes.\n\nThere have been various campaigns to help prevent alcoholism, under-age drinking and drunk driving. The Portman Group, an association of leading drinks producers in the UK, are responsible for various such campaigns. These include responsible drinking, drink driving (and designated drivers), proof of age cards. The \"Drink Aware\" campaign, for example, aims to educate people about how to drink sensibly and avoid binge drinking. The web site address is displayed as part of all of the adverts for products made by members of the group.\n\nThe Century Council, financially supported by a group of alcoholic beverage distillers in the United States, promotes responsible decision-making regarding drinking or non-drinking and works to reduce all forms of irresponsible consumption. Since its founding in 1991, it has invested over 175 million dollars in its programs.\n\nMany campaigns by the alcoholic beverage industry that advocate responsible drinking presuppose that drinking for recreational purposes is a positive activity and reinforce this idea as an example of sensible consumption. Persons who believe alcohol can never simultaneously be used \"sensibly\" and recreationally would obviously disagree with the focus or direction of these campaigns.\n\nA controversial anti-drunk driving advertisement in South Africa has threatened the public with rape in prison. The campaign is still underway with no reported complaints to the advertising standards authorities.\n\nThe sponsorship of sporting events and sportspeople is banned in many countries. For example, the primary club competition in European rugby union, the Heineken Cup, is called the \"H Cup\" in France because of that country's restrictions on alcohol advertising. However, such sponsorship is still common in other areas, such as the United States, although such sponsorship is controversial as children are often a target audience for major professional sports leagues.\n\nAlcohol advertising is common in motor racing competitions, and is particularly prominent in NASCAR and IndyCar. One major example of this was the Busch Series (now known as the Xfinity Series), sponsored by a brand of beer sold by Anheuser-Busch. That sponsorship, which started in the series' conversion from a national Late Model Sportsman races around the country to the present touring format in 1982, ended after 2007.\n\nBudweiser, the best-known Anheuser-Busch brand, has sponsored IndyCar drivers such as Mario Andretti, Bobby Rahal and Paul Tracy, as well as NASCAR Cup drivers such as Terry Labonte, Neil Bonnett, Darrell Waltrip, Bill Elliott, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Kasey Kahne and currently Kevin Harvick. Meanwhile, Miller has sponsored Al Unser, Danny Sullivan, Bobby Rahal, Rusty Wallace, Kurt Busch and currently Brad Keselowski.\n\nFurthermore, NASCAR mandates drivers under 21 not be permitted to wear any alcohol-branded sticker on their cars. In cases with below drinking age drivers, a specialised \"Coors Pole Award - 21 Means 21\" sticker is placed on such drivers' cars. One team, Petty Enterprises, refuses to participate in alcohol advertising and forfeits all alcohol monies and bonuses.\n\nFor distilled spirits, teams must run a responsible drinking sticker clearly visible on the car. For Jack Daniel's, the theme is \"Pace Yourself, Drink Responsibly\", and includes on NASCAR's Web site a waving yellow flag warning drinkers. For Crown Royal, the television ads feature the car with the slogan \"Be a champion, Drink Responsibly\" and it acting as a pace car to drivers, warning them of responsibility. Jim Beam has radio ads and NASCAR mandated statements about alcohol control. None of the three, however, is a full-time sponsor, as they alternate sponsorship with other products unrelated to their firm on the car. (Jim Beam's parent, Fortune Brands, sometimes has its Moen Faucets replace Jim Beam on the car in selected races.)\n\nAlthough tobacco companies have been the main source of financial backing in Formula One, some alcohol brands have also been associated with the sport. For example, Martini appears on the Williams F1 car while Johnnie Walker has sponsored McLaren since 2006.\n\nAnheuser-Busch, being a conglomerate with non-alcoholic properties, complies with the French alcohol advertising ban in Formula One by placing their Busch Entertainment theme park logos (mostly SeaWorld) where their Budweiser logo would appear on the Williams F1 car at races where alcohol advertising is banned and in Middle Eastern countries, where alcohol advertising is discouraged. A few companies, however, have added responsible drinking campaigns with their sponsorship, notably the 1989–90 BTCC Ford Sierra RS500 of Tim Harvey and Laurence Bristow, which was sponsored by Labatt. Throughout the two seasons, the car bore a \"Please Don't Drink and Drive\" message.\n\nSome stadiums, particularly in the U.S., bear the names of breweries or beer brands via naming rights arrangements, such as Busch Stadium, Coors Field, and Miller Park; those three venues are all in or near the cities of their headquarters.\n\nDiageo are a major sponsor of many sporting events through their various brands. For example, Johnnie Walker sponsor the Championship at Gleneagles and Classic golf tournaments along with the Team McLaren Formula One car.\n\nCricket is a sport with a large amount of alcohol sponsorship. The 2005 Ashes, for example, featured sponsorship hoardings by brands such as Red Stripe, Thwaites Lancaster Bomber and Wolf Blass wines. In nations like India and Sri Lanka where alcoholic advertising is generally prohibited, those regulations are rounded with distillers offering clothing lines and sports equipment marked with one of their brands or separate soft drink or bottled water lines within tournaments such as the Indian Premier League and test matches, such as United Spirits Limited's McDowell's No.1 and Pernod Ricard's Royal Stag.\n\nRugby union also has a substantial amount of alcohol sponsorship. The All Blacks feature Steinlager sponsorship prominently. The Scotland national team has a long-established relationship with The Famous Grouse, a brand of Scotch whisky. Wales has a more recent relationship with the Brains brewery (But wear \"Brawn\" when playing in France), and the Springboks of South Africa agreed for South African Breweries to put the Lion Lager, then, the Castle Lager brand on their shirt until 2004. Magners was the title sponsor of the Celtic League, the top competition in Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Guinness was the title sponsor of the Premiership, the top competition in England, and \nnow sponsor The Six Nations Championship (the logo is replaced with \"Six Nations, Greatness\" in France.) Beer brand Tooheys New was the Australian sponsor of the Southern Hemisphere Super 14 competition through the 2006 season. Bundaberg Rum is one of the sponsors of the Australia national rugby union team.\n\nRugby league in Australia is sponsored by Victoria Bitter and Bundaberg Rum.\n\nGuinness' iconic stature can be attributed in part to its advertising campaigns. One of the most notable and recognizable series of adverts was created by S.H. Benson's advertising, primarily John Gilroy, in the 1930s and 1940s. Gilroy was responsible for creating posters which included such phrases such as \"Guinness for Strength\", \"It's a Lovely Day for a Guinness\", and most famously, \"Guinness is Good For You\". The posters featured Gilroy's distinctive artwork and more often than not featured animals such as a kangaroo, ostrich, seal, lion, and notably a toucan, which has become as much a symbol of Guinness as the Trinity College Harp. Guinness advertising paraphernalia attracts high prices on the collectible market.\n\nIn a campaign reminiscent of viral marketing techniques, one advert quickly appeared as a screensaver distributed over the Internet. It was a simple concept, featuring Dublin actor Joe McKinney dancing around the drink while it was given time to settle. The accompanying music (mambo tune \"Guaglione\" by Pérez Prado) was released as a single and reached number one on the Irish charts in September 1994 and number two on the UK charts in May 1995 (see List of number-one singles of 1994 (Ireland) List of UK top 10 singles in 1995).\n\nIn Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong, Guinness launched an $8 million advertising campaign using the fictional character of Adam King to promote the embodiment of Guinness as a man could be incredibly powerful. The advertising campaign was handled by advertising firm, Saatchi & Saatchi.\n\nIn Africa, the character of Michael Power has been used since 1999 to boost sales.\n\nToday, Guinness' principal television campaign in North America consists of limited animation commercials featuring two eccentric scientists in 19th-century dress complimenting one another's ideas as \"brilliant!\"\n\nAbsolut vodka is made in Sweden and was introduced to the United States in the year 1979. Its launch was a true challenge due to a variety of factors: Sweden was not perceived as a vodka-producing country, the bottle was very awkward for bartenders to use, and vodka was perceived as a cheap, tasteless drink. Absolut's advertising campaign by TBWA exploited the shape of the bottle to create clever advertisements that caused people to become involved in the advertising, and the brand took off. Before Absolut, there were very few distinctions in the vodka category. Today there are regular, premium, and superpremium vodkas each at different price points and qualities. Flavoured vodka varieties have become numerous and may be found commonly in stores in the U.S.A.\n\nSport has been suggested to be one of the primary, if not the dominant, medium for the promotion of alcohol and drinking to the general population with the majority of advertising spend an advertising placement occurring in sport. Work from New Zealand\nand Australia shows that sponsorship of sports participants or athletes is associated with more hazardous drinking, with calls from the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, for bans on alcohol industry sponsorship and advertising in sport.\n\n\n\n"}

The reaction can be performed using magnesium, aluminium, zinc, indium, tin, samarium, barium or their salts. The reaction product is a primary, secondary or tertiary alcohol. The reaction is similar to the Grignard reaction but the crucial difference is that the organometallic species in the Barbier reaction is generated \"in situ\", whereas a Grignard reagent is prepared separately before addition of the carbonyl compound. Unlike many Grignard reagents, the organometallic species generated in a Barbier reaction are unstable, necessitating their immediate usage. Barbier reactions are nucleophilic addition reactions that involve relatively inexpensive, water insensitive metals or metal compounds. For this reason it is possible in many cases to run the reaction in water, making the procedure part of green chemistry. In contrast, Grignard reagents and organolithium reagents are highly moisture sensitive and must be used under an inert atmosphere without the presence of water. The Barbier reaction is named after Victor Grignard's teacher Philippe Barbier.\n\nExamples of Barbier reactions are the reaction of propargylic bromide with butanal with zinc metal (the reaction is carried out in THF, the saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution added later to quench the reaction):\n\nthe intramolecular Barbier reaction with samarium(II) iodide:\n\nthe reaction of an allyl bromide with formaldehyde in THF with indium powder:\n\nor another allyl bromide in a reaction with benzaldehyde and zinc powder in water:\n\nThe synthesis of (+)-aspicillin, starts first with a hydroboration, then transmetallation to zinc which can then do an addition into the aldehyde substituent.\n\n"}

{"id": "2322073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322073", "title": "Five Stairsteps", "text": "Five Stairsteps\n\nThe Five Stairsteps, known as \"The First Family of Soul\" and later \"The Invisible Man's Band\", was an American Chicago soul group made up of five of Betty and Clarence Burke Sr.'s six children: Alohe Jean, Clarence Jr., James, Dennis, and Kenneth \"Keni\", and briefly, Cubie. They are best known for the 1970 song \"O-o-h Child\", listed at #402 on \"Rolling Stone\"'s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nThe Chicago group was dubbed \"First Family of Soul\" because of their successful five-year chart run; the moniker was later passed on to The Jackson 5. Initially a teenage five-member brothers and sister vocal group made up of the children of Betty and Clarence Burke, The Five Stairsteps, named by Mrs. Burke who thought her kids looked like stair steps when lined up according to their age, featured lead singer Clarence Jr., Alohe, James, Dennis, and 13-year-old Kenneth (\"Keni\"). Most of the members attended Harlan High School. Clarence Sr. was a detective for the Chicago Police Department. He backed the group on bass guitar, managed them, and co-wrote songs with Clarence Jr. and Gregory Fowler.\n\nAfter winning first prize in a talent contest at the Regal Theater, the Five Stairsteps received recording contract offers. A close neighbor and family friend was Fred Cash of The Impressions, who introduced the group to Curtis Mayfield. They signed to Mayfield's Windy City imprint, which was distributed by the Philadelphia based Cameo Parkway record label, their first single was Gregory Fowler's ballad \"You Waited Too Long\" b/w \"Don't Waste Your Time,\" a Mayfield song. A double-sided hit in Chicago, the A-side, \"You Waited Too Long,\" charted number 16 in the Billboard R&B chart in spring of 1966. Around the end of 1967, Cameo-Parkway folded and Windy City switched to Buddah Records through former Cameo-Parkway executive Neil Bogart, who joined the new label as co-president. The group's second album, \"Family Portrait\" (complete with a montage of Burke family photos), was recorded and produced in Chicago by Clarence Jr. With the addition of their three-year-old brother, the group became The Five Stairsteps & Cubie. \"Family Portrait\" yielded two hit singles, \"Something's Missing\" and a cover of Jimmy Charles and the Revelletts' hit \"A Million to One.\" The group often toured with the Impressions. After signing with Buddah Records, the group was once again known as The Five Stairsteps.\n\nClarence Burke appeared as himself on the September 26, 1967 episode of the game show To Tell The Truth, receiving two of the four possible votes by the panel members. Following the round of questioning, the group performed for the audience, singing \"Danger! She's a Stranger\".\n\nIn the spring of 1970, the group released their biggest hit, \"O-o-h Child\" (written by Stan Vincent), which hit number 14 R&B and number eight on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. This disc sold over one million copies, and received a gold disc awarded by the R.I.A.A. in August 1970.\nThe flip side of the single, a cover of Lennon–McCartney's \"Dear Prudence,\" charted at number 49 R&B. The following year, the group resurfaced as The Stairsteps with two charting Buddah singles: \"Didn't It Look So Easy\" and \"I Love You-Stop.\" The group appeared in the 1970 movie \"The Isley Brothers Live At Yankee Stadium\", a documentary of a benefit concert filmed at the famous home of the New York Yankees featuring The Isley Brothers, The Brooklyn Bridge and various other Buddah Records affiliated artists. In the early 1970s, the group was known simply as The Stairsteps. Alohe was still with the group. Cubie never really sang with the group, but would grow up to be a popular dancer with the Dance Theater of Harlem etc. Billy Preston introduced The Stairsteps to The Beatles, and the group signed with George Harrison's Dark Horse label distributed by A&M Records. Alohe left the group in 1972 to begin a spiritual journey, and later would attend college, graduate and work at Emory University at which she was also a guest speaker. An album, \"Second Resurrection\", was released in February 1976, produced by Preston, Robert Margouleff, and the Stairsteps. \"From Us to You,\" written by Clarence Jr. and Keni Burke, was the group's biggest hit since \"Ooh Child,\" peaking at number ten R&B in early 1976. The follow-up single, \"Pasado\", also covered by the group Pockets, received airplay in Chicago, New York, and other markets. Keni sang, played bass, and wrote both songs on the third single, \"Tell Me Why\" b/w \"Salaam.\" in January 2014, the album was reissued on cd in Europe by the Solaris label, as was Keni Burke's eponymous Dark Horse album.\n\nAfter the Stairsteps disbanded, Keni remained with Dark Horse as a solo artist. His self-produced debut solo LP, \"Keni Burke\", was released in August 1977. The singles were \"Keep on Singing\" and \"From Me to You,\" an instrumental answer to \"From Us to You.\" Becoming an in-demand session bass player, he can be heard on everyone from Sly & the Family Stone, Natalie Cole, Billy Preston, Les McCann, the Emotions, Raffi and The Four Tops to Redman, Terry Callier, Stargard, Curtis Mayfield, Bill Withers, Linda Clifford, Silk, Narada Michael Walden, Ramsey Lewis, Dusty Springfield, Diana Ross and Gladys Knight. He appeared as part of Bill Withers' band around this time and co-produced his album, \"Menagerie\", which included the hit single \"Lovely Day.\"\n\nIn 1978, Clarence, Jr. teamed up with New York-based producer Alex Masucci to form the group The Invisible Man's Band. Not interested in recording without his brothers, Clarence convinced Keni, James, and Dennis, along with keyboardist Dean Gant and drummer Steve Ferrone, to come to New York City's Brill building to record an album under the Invisible Man's Band moniker. The group's self-titled debut, produced by Masucci and Clarence, Jr. and released in 1980 by Mango/Island Records, featured the heavily discofied hit \"All Night Thing,\" which returned the Burke brothers to the top ten on the R&B chart. The tune also reached #45 on the pop chart. Several other singles were released from this album throughout 1980, but they could not replicate the success of the first hit.\n\nThe following year, Clarence, Jr. and Masucci formed Seduction Productions. As the new vehicle for the Invisible Man's Band, they signed a production deal with Boardwalk Records, Neil Bogart's follow up label to Casablanca Records. The group soon released a follow-up album, \"Really Wanna See You.\" While the title track and \"Rated X\" were released as singles, neither track received much promotion, as shortly thereafter, Neil Bogart died and the label was disbanded. While no further full-length albums were released under the \"Invisible Man's Band\" name, the group later released one final single, \"Sunday Afternoon,\" on the Move 'N Groove Record Label, a new label formed by Masucci and Clarence, Jr., in 1983.\n\nLater in 1981, Burke got a new solo album deal with RCA Records. The self-produced LP \"You're the Best\" included the singles, \"Let Somebody Love You\" and the title track \"You're the Best.\" His next RCA album, 1982's \"Changes\", yielded his biggest solo hit, \"Risin' to the Top.\" While the song only peaked at number 63 R&B in late summer 1982, \"Risin' to the Top\" served as the baseline (and bass-line) for The Mary Jane Girls' breakout hit the following year, \"All Night Long,\" and has since been sampled (often along with \"All Night Long\") by multiple artists, including LL Cool J (\"Around the Way Girl\"), Doug E. Fresh (\"Keep Risin' to the Top\"), Mary J. Blige (\"Love No Limit\" and \"Mary Jane (All Night Long)\") and Ali (\"Feelin' You.\")\n\nThe second \"Changes\" single was \"Shakin'.\" \"Changes\" is also notable because it includes one of the last songs by Philadelphia songwriter Linda Creed (co-written with Thom Bell), the mid-tempo ballad \"One Minute More.\" Burke worked as a writer/producer (frequently with keyboardist Dean Gant and former Average White Band drummer Steve Ferrone) with The O'Jays, The Jones Girls, The Whispers, Keith Sweat, George Howard, Peabo Bryson, Bill Withers, and Perri, among others. After meeting Expansion Records executive Ralph Tee at a Berwick Soul Weekender, Burke signed with the Sony distributed UK label. \"Nothin' But Love\" was his first album for the label and was released in March 1998. The first 12\" single was \"I Need Your Love\" with vocals by Burke's son, Osaze \"Ozzie\" Burke.\n\nClarence Burke, Jr. died on May 26, 2013, at his home in Marietta, Georgia. He was 64. The cause of his death was not disclosed. He was survived by his wife, Crystal, and five children.\n\nCubie Burke died May 14, 2014, in Smyrna, Georgia, at the age of 49.\n\nDean Gant died April 25, 2020.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He served as Artistic Director of The Public Theatre from 1993 until 2004.\n\nWolfe was born into an African-American family in Frankfort, Kentucky, the son of Anna (née Lindsey), an educator, and Costello Wolfe, a government clerk. He attended an all-black public school (a Rosenwald school) where his mother taught. He is interviewed in the documentary film, \"Rosenwald\", discussing his time at the school. After a family move, he began attending the integrated Frankfort public schools.\n\nWolfe attended Frankfort High School where he began to pursue his interest in the theatre arts, and wrote poetry and prose for the school's literary journal. After high school, Wolfe enrolled at Kentucky State University, a historically black college and the \"alma mater\" of his parents. Following his first year, he transferred to Pomona College in Claremont, California, where he pursued a BA in theater. Wolfe taught for several years in Los Angeles at the Inner City Cultural Center.\n\nHe moved to the East Coast and taught in New York City. In 1983 he earned an MFA in dramatic writing and musical theater at New York University (NYU).\n\nIn 1977, Wolfe gave C. Bernard Jackson, the executive director of the Inner City Cultural Center in the Los Angeles, the first scene of a play he was working on. Rather than suggest that he finish writing it, Jackson said, \"Here's some money, go do it.\" The name of the play was \"Tribal Rites, or The Coming of the Great God-bird Nabuku to the Age of Horace Lee Lizer\". Wolfe stated in an article he wrote about Jackson for the \"Los Angeles Times\" that \"this production was perhaps the most crucial to my evolution\" as an artist.\n\nAmong Wolfe's first major offerings—the musical \"Paradise\" (1985) and his play \"The Colored Museum\" (1986)--were off-Broadway productions that met with mixed reviews. In 1990, however, Wolfe won an Obie Award for best off-Broadway director for his play \"Spunk\", an adaptation of three stories by Zora Neale Hurston.\n\nWolfe gained a national reputation with his 1991 musical \"Jelly's Last Jam\", a musical about the life of jazz musician Jelly Roll Morton. After a Los Angeles opening, the play moved to Broadway, where it received 11 Tony nominations and won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Book of a Musical. Two years later, Wolfe directed Tony Kushner's \"Angels in America: Millennium Approaches\" to great critical acclaim, and won a Tony Award. Wolfe also directed the world premiere of the second part of \"Angels\", entitled \"Perestroika\", the following year.\n\nFrom 1993 to 2004, Wolfe served as artistic director and producer of the New York Shakespeare Festival/Public Theater. In 1996 he created the musical \"Bring in 'Da Noise, Bring in 'Da Funk\", an ensemble of tap and music starring Savion Glover; the show moved to Broadway's Ambassador Theatre. His work won a second Tony Award for direction and was an enormous financial success.\n\nIn 2000, Wolfe co-wrote the book and directed the Broadway production of the musical \"The Wild Party\".\n\nIn late 2004, Wolfe announced his intention to leave the theater for film direction, beginning with the well-received HBO film \"Lackawanna Blues\".\n\nWolfe has also continued to direct plays, such as Suzan-Lori Parks' Pulitzer Prize-winning play \"Topdog/Underdog\" (2001), and Tony Kushner's \"Caroline, or Change\" (2003), a through-composed musical. In the summer of 2006, Wolfe directed a new translation of Bertolt Brecht's \"Mother Courage and Her Children\" at the Delacorte Theatre in Central Park, starring Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, and Austin Pendleton.\n\nWolfe directed the film \"Nights in Rodanthe\", starring Richard Gere and Diane Lane, which opened in theaters in September 2008.\n\nWolfe is bringing his artistic talent to the design of the upcoming Center for Civil & Human Rights in Atlanta as its new chief creative officer.\n\nIn 2013, he was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.\n\nIn August 2017, Wolfe was the only one of the 17 private members of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities who did not sign on to a letter of mass resignation in the wake of Donald Trump's remarks on the Unite the Right rally incident in Charlottesville, Virginia. However, his representatives stated that he, too, would be resigning and would add his name to the letter.\n\nWolfe directed a Broadway revival of Eugene O'Neill's \"The Iceman Cometh\" in 2018, with Denzel Washington starring as Hickey.

The polar night and the midnight sun makes Tromsø a city were some people struggle to sleep normally, made famous in the Norwegian movie \"Insomnia\" by Tromsø director Erik Skjoldbjærg. The movie later got an American re-make, also named \"Insomnia\", starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams.\n\nBeing a festival targeting clubbers, the name suggests that instead of sleeping you can go clubbing.\n\nThe festival had a Norwegian profile in the early years. Many of the famous Norwegian acts have therefore visited the festival more than once. Having grown in popularity year after year, far more international acts have been booked to the festival lately. The booking of Public Enemy in 2006 was somehow a turning point for the festival and their ambition.\n\nDuring the last years the festival has extended to contain also seminars, workshops and exhibitions.

The Apparat concert was rated as one of the best gigs in Tromsø in 2007 by local newspaper Nordlys.\n\nIn 2008 The Legendary Pink Dots, FM Belfast, Ismael Pinkler, Mimetic, SCSI-9, Djuma Soundsystem, Xploding Plastix and Ost & Kjex were booked to the festival.\n\nThe 2009 edition had a remarkable kick-off, featuring none other than Röyksopp, in what was their first concert back in their hometown since the breakthrough with Melody A.M. in 2001. The event sold out in only a few hours. Röyksopp's members Svein Berge and Torbjørn Brundtland are childhood friends with board member Gaute Barlindhaug of the Insomnia Festival, and the superstars decided to do the gig for free to help save the further existence of the electronic music festival in their hometown. The profit from the sold out event helped save the troubled economy of the festival.\n\nAmong other artists visiting the 2009 festival, was British The Emperor Machine, Andrew Meecham of Bizarre Inc's solo project. Another British appearance was Wave Machines. Matias Aguayo, Loccomotion, Deadbots, Khan of Finland, Glitterbug, Thomas Fehlmann, Tycho, Mike Huckaby and Menelaos completed the international part of the line-up. Lindstrøm was a national headliner, following his growing success in the later years. Also worth mentioning from the line-up, are the acclaimed local acts F.A.C.E, Femme Digital and Kohib, whom all had their debut gigs at the festival. Skatebård, Alexander Rishaug and Captain Credible were other Norwegian acts to visit.\n\nIn 2010, Bill Drummond, Tesla Boy, Kyle Hall, Alexander Robotnick, Wildbirds & Peacedrums, Brandt Brauer Frick, Captain Fufanu and Diskjokke Band were among the most notable artists whom visited the festival.\n\n\n"}

He was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars 25th overall in the 1998 NFL Draft, and played for nine seasons with the team. He played for the Miami Dolphins in 2007. He played college football at Syracuse.\n\nDarius played for two years at Highland Regional High School in Blackwood, New Jersey before transferring in his junior year. Darius is a graduate of Woodrow Wilson High School in Camden, New Jersey.\n\nDarius played at Syracuse University, setting the team record for tackles by a defensive back with 379. He was a Big East All-Conference player in 1995 and 1996, and also lettered in indoor and outdoor hurdles, graduating in 1997 with a degree in exercise science and a minor in coaching.\n\nDarius was selected 25th overall in the 1998 NFL Draft by the Jacksonville Jaguars, then the highest pick ever by the team for a defensive back. He was the sixth defensive back selected, behind Tebucky Jones, Duane Starks, and others. He was named to the All-Rookie team and led Jaguar defensive backs with 108 tackles in 14 games. In 1999, he switched to strong safety and continued to sharpen his skills as a defensive force.\n\nIn 2004, Darius led the secondary in tackles for a seventh straight season and posted career highs in forced fumbles and interceptions. His season-ending injury in 2005 stopped his consecutive start streak at 37.\n\nIn 2004, Darius was fined $75,000 for pulling off an extremely dangerous clothesline tackle on Green Bay Packers wide receiver Robert Ferguson. However, Darius later apologized to Ferguson for the incident and visited him at the hospital. Prior to his release, he had been with the Jaguars longer than any other active player along with running back Fred Taylor.\n\nDarius signed a three-year extension on August 29, 2005 which put him under contract through 2008. However, he tore his anterior cruciate ligament during the Jaguars' second game of the 2005 NFL season and was placed on injured reserve.\n\nOn November 20, 2006, during a \"Monday Night Football\" game against the New York Giants, he broke his leg and missed the rest of the 2006 season.\n\nOn December 14, 2006, Darius was released by the Jaguars.\n\nDonovin signed with the Oakland Raiders on January 1, 2007, but was released in the final roster cuts. He was subsequently signed by the Miami Dolphins, but was released again in October.\n\nDarius signed a one-day ceremonial contract with the Jaguars on March 1, 2013 to retire as a member of the team. He currently serves on the NFL Players Association Executive Committee and resides in Jacksonville, Florida, where he earned an MBA from Jacksonville University.\n\nAccording to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, Darius was arrested and charged with DUI after crashing his car on the morning of January 26, 2020. He was subsequently transported to a Jacksonville area hospital for a mental health evaluation after telling rescue workers he had ingested 20 to 30 pills and that he was suicidal.\n"}

It is an inlet of the English Channel in Hampshire, sandwiched between Portsea Island to the south and west, Hayling Island to the south and east, and Langstone to the north. It is part of Chichester and Langstone Harbours Ramsar site, Special Protection Area and Nature Conservation Review site, Grade I. Parts of it are in Solent Maritime and Solent and Isle of Wight Lagoons Special Areas of Conservation. Three areas are Local Nature Reserves, Farlington Marshes West Hayling and The Kench, Hayling Island. Two areas are nature reserves managed by the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust, Farlington Marshes and Southmoor Nature Reserve\n\nWest of Portsmouth is Portsmouth Harbour and the three linked harbours are important recreational and conservation areas as well as supporting commercial fishing and shipping. It is administered by the Langstone Harbour Board. The eastern boundary with Chichester Harbour is defined by a historic causeway known as the wade way, which was originally the only crossing between Hayling Island and the mainland. It is now impassable, having been cut in two by a deep channel for the Portsmouth and Arundel Canal in the 1820s (for further information see Langstone).\n\nLangstone Harbour contains a number of islands; Baker's Island (), North Binness Island (), South Binness Island () and Long Island (). These are subject to erosion and during the 1990s a seven-year archaeology project took place before their history was lost to the seas. There are two smaller islands: Round Nap Island which is connected to South Binness Island by a tidal causeway and Oyster Island.\n\nLangstone Harbour was originally a river valley of one of the tributaries flowing into the then River Solent. With the end of the last ice age sea levels rose until sometime between 4000 and 3500BC the harbour took on the form it would have until the 18th century.\n\nFor much of its history the harbour has been an area of salt production. The Domesday Book records three salterns around the harb-our and by the early 17th century a saltern at Copnor was well established. Here a large shallow area of the harbour meant that even without further improvement salt could be extracted from the area after each tide. The Copnor saltern ceased production in 1800 but salt production continued elsewhere in the harbour until 1933.\n\nIn 1771 Farlington Marshes were reclaimed from the north of the harbour.\n\nOyster farming began in the harbour around 1820 with winkle and clam cultivation probably starting around much the same time. Production ceased in the 1950s. An attempt at oyster farming in the 1980s soon failed. In 1997 work began to turn the remains into an artificial lagoon. The lagoon which has a small island at the centre has, as planned, become a breeding ground for birds, particularly little terns.\n\nDuring the Second World War the harbour was used as Starfish decoy site to misdirect German bombers.\n\nThe harbour is home to an extensive range of marine and bird life. Fifty species of fish have been found in the harbour. The harbour's bird life is even richer, the harbour hosting a wide range of species some of which are represented by over 10,000 individuals. This is in a large part due to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds acquiring harbour's islands and a number of tidal areas in 1978 and turning them into bird sanctuaries. As a result of the number of birds the harbour as become a popular spot for bird watchers.\n\nSeals occasionally appear in the harbour in winter. American hard-shelled clams have been found in the harbour spreading from an initial release site on the lower River Test. The harbour is also home to a population of Sand smelt. \n\nOn 31 July 2008 a 26-foot (8-metre), 7-tonne northern bottlenose whale was beached on a mudflat in Langstone Harbour. A rescue operation was carried out to try to save the whale off the south coast of England and managed to free the whale from mudflats using a special lifting pontoon but it remained in shallow water. A decision was made to give the whale a lethal injection as a blood test revealed that it was suffering from kidney failure. If the whale swam into deeper water it could take up to two days to die naturally from renal failure. The whale ended up about off course due to its illness.\n\nThere are several boat wrecks in the harbour. One of these is a tug dating from 8 May 1941. The tug named the \"Irishman\" was sunk by a magnetic mine and now rests partially submerged at low tide. A slightly older wreck dating from 1926 is a Bucket dredger named the \"Withern\". Of unrecorded age is the wreck of the \"Excelsior\", an 80-foot-long barge. The harbour also contains a wrecked landing craft that rests with its bows almost permanently above the surface.\n\nClose to the entrance of the harbour, there is a wrecked Phoenix breakwater type C. It was originally constructed to form part of a World War 2 Mulberry Harbour.\n\nVarious artefacts have been found from the prison hulks that were kept in the harbour during the Napoleonic wars.\n\n"}

As with many genetic disorders, no cure is known, although research continues. Because of its endocrine manifestations related to the impairment of the \"AR\" gene, SBMA can be viewed as a variation of the disorders of the androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). It is also related to other neurodegenerative diseases caused by similar mutations, such as Huntington's disease.\n\nIndividuals with SBMA have muscle cramps and progressive weakness due to degeneration of motor neurons in the brain stem and spinal cord. Ages of onset and severity of manifestations in affected males vary from adolescence to old age, but most commonly develop in middle adult life. The syndrome has neuromuscular and endocrine manifestations.\n\nEarly signs often include weakness of tongue and mouth muscles, fasciculations, and gradually increasing weakness of limb muscles with muscle wasting. Neuromuscular management is supportive, and the disease progresses very slowly, but can eventually lead to extreme disability. Further signs and symptoms include:\n\nHomozygous females, both of whose X chromosomes have a mutation leading to CAG expansion of the \"AR\" gene, have been reported to show only mild symptoms of muscle cramps and twitching. No endocrinopathy has been described.\n\nThe genetics of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy have to do with the mutated androgen receptor gene located on the X chromosome. The effects of the mutation may be androgen-dependent, thus only males are fully affected. Females are rarely affected; female carriers tend to have a relatively mild expression of the disease if they show symptoms at all.\n\nThe mechanism behind SBMA is caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in the first exon of the androgen receptor gene (trinucleotide repeats). The CAG repeat encodes a polyglutamine tract in the androgen receptor protein. The greater the expansion of the CAG repeat, the earlier the disease onset and more severe the disease manifestations. The repeat expansion likely causes a toxic gain of function in the receptor protein, since loss of receptor function in androgen insensitivity syndrome does not cause motor neuron degeneration.\n\nSpinal and bulbar muscular atrophy may share mechanistic features with other disorders caused by polyglutamine expansion, such as Huntington's disease. No cure for SBMA is known.\n\nIn regards to the diagnosis of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, the \"AR Xq12\" gene is the focus. Many mutations are reported and identified as missense/nonsense, that can be identified with 99.9% accuracy. Test for this gene in the majority of affected patients yields the diagnosis.\n\nIn terms of the management of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, no cure is known and treatment is supportive. Rehabilitation to slow muscle weakness can prove positive, though the prognosis indicates some individuals will require the use of a wheelchair in later stages of life.\n\nSurgery may achieve correction of the spine, and early surgical intervention should be done in cases where prolonged survival is expected. Preferred nonsurgical treatment occurs due to the high rate of repeated dislocation of the hip.\n\nA 2006 study followed 223 patients for a number of years. Of these, 15 died, with a median age of 65 years. The authors tentatively concluded that this is in line with a previously reported estimate of a shortened life expectancy of 10–15 years (12 in their data).\n\nThis disorder was first described by William R. Kennedy in 1968. In 1991, it was recognized that the\" AR \"gene is involved in the disease process. The disease is probably more common than originally thought, SBMA prevalence has been estimated at 1:300,000 males.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2322112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322112", "title": "Rejoined", "text": "Rejoined\n\n\"Rejoined\" is the 78th episode of the American science fiction television series \"\", the sixth of the . It originally aired on October 30, 1995, in broadcast syndication. The episode received a record volume of feedback from viewers for the series, both positive and negative, as it marked one of the first televised lesbian kisses. \n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, a space station located near a stable wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy. The plot of \"Rejoined\" expands on the Trill species, of which Jadzia Dax is a member. They are formed of a host and a symbiont, with the symbiont passed from host to host as the previous one dies. In the episode, Dax is reunited with Lenara Kahn, the widow of one of its former hosts. The two struggle with their feelings for one another because of the taboo in their species against reuniting with loved ones of former hosts as they work together to experiment on wormholes.\n\nThe episode was the first that writers Ronald D. Moore and René Echevarria wrote together, and it was directed by main cast member Avery Brooks. In the first draft, Dax's former partner was written as male, but after this was changed, the story was cleared through studio executives. The Trill taboo was intended to be an allegory for homosexuality and homophobia. \"Rejoined\" received a Nielsen rating of seven percent on the first broadcast in syndication. Reviews have been mostly positive towards the episode because of its message, but there was criticism that the plot was not exciting enough and there was a negative reaction from some viewers.\n\nCaptain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) notifies Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) that a group of Trill scientists will be arriving soon at Deep Space Nine to perform experiments related to wormhole physics. The Trill are a species of humanoids, some of whom host a sluglike symbiont implanted into them. The symbionts live far longer than the hosts, and are moved into a new host when the old one dies. Jadzia is the eighth host of the Dax symbiont. Sisko tells Dax that the head scientist is Lenara Kahn (Susanna Thompson), and offers to grant Dax a leave of absence while the Trill scientists are aboard, but she turns it down. Upon Dax and Kahn's first meeting, Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) notices that they are very familiar with each other; Dax tells her that Kahn used to be her wife. Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) later explains to Kira that previous hosts of the Dax and Kahn symbionts were married to each other, but Trill are forbidden from reassociating with partners and lovers of past hosts, and says that.\n\nAt the welcome party for the visiting scientists, Dax and Kahn warm to one another's company once more. Afterward, they begin to socialize as they work together on Kahn's wormhole experiment aboard USS \"Defiant\". They agree to have dinner, but to also bring Bashir along as a chaperone. At the dinner, Bashir is effectively ignored by the two Trills as they reminisce about their past hosts. Later, back on the \"Defiant\", Kahn successfully creates an artificial wormhole and Dax hugs her in celebration. Kahn's brother Bejal (Tim Ryan), who is on the science team, speaks to her separately and highlights his concerns regarding her contact with Dax. Despite this, Kahn goes to Dax's quarters and a discussion between the two leads to a kiss; Kahn leaves before it goes any further.\n\nDax confides in Sisko that she knows she is in love with her former wife. He reminds her that Trill customs mean that if they resumed their relationship, then they would be exiled from their homeworld and their symbionts would never be joined with a new host, but says that she will have his support either way. Kahn and Dax continue to work on the experiment, but it goes wrong and \"Defiant\" is severely damaged. Kahn is injured in the explosion, but Dax rigs a force field across a plasma fire that allows her to reach Kahn, coming to the realization that the relationship is worth exile. After returning to the station, Kahn recuperates from her injuries. She decides against resuming her relationship with Dax, and—with the experiments complete—departs with the science team, leaving Dax heartbroken.\n\n\"Rejoined\" marked the first time that longtime \"Star Trek\" writers Ronald D. Moore and René Echevarria wrote a script together. They had been hired by executive producer Michael Piller following separate unsolicited manuscripts submitted during the of \"\", and had remained on the staff of the franchise since. In Echevarria's first draft of the story, there was no lesbian element as Dax's former lover was male. The Trill taboo against reuniting relationships from past hosts was suggested by Piller early on in the creation of \"Deep Space Nine\", in order for the society to prevent an \"aristocracy of the joined\", where joined hosts never met anyone that they did not already know.\n\nIt was Moore's suggestion to make Dax's former partner a woman in order to tackle the taboo against homosexuality by way of the on-screen taboo against re-association. At that stage, they intended to make no reference in the script to any characters having a concern about Dax's relationship with a woman so as to focus the story. Clearance was sought for the plot, first from showrunner Ira Steven Behr, then executive producer Rick Berman, and finally from the studio executives. Moore later explained that they agreed to the idea, saying that \"Star Trek\" stood for making statements like those in \"Rejoined\".\n\nTerry Farrell was happy with the story line, saying that it made sense for Dax to have this issue because the symbiont had been in both male and female hosts, adding that \"Gender wasn't the issue. For the worm/symbiont, it was a matter of the being it was embodied in.\" She was pleased to be able to \"stand up\" for the LGBT community. A similar story had been approached during the first appearance of the Trill in \"The Next Generation\" episode \"\". In this story, however, when the symbiont is transferred from a male to a female host, the Trill is rejected by the character who was the Trill's female partner, Beverly Crusher. The subplot featuring Kahn's artificial wormhole was described as a \"MacGuffin\" by Moore, and simply a way to get the character into \"Rejoined\". This was not the first subplot to be considered for the episode, with the main plot from \"\" originally thought of as being suitable to appear in either \"Rejoined\" or \"\". Instead, the plot, which involved Rom forming a trade union, was expanded into the main plot of its own episode.\n\nThe episode was directed by main cast member Avery Brooks, who played Benjamin Sisko in the series, who later said that \"Rejoined\" was his favourite of the episodes he directed. He said that the episode was about love, and the choices that result from that, and that it was an extraordinary story about losing someone you love and having that person restored to you some time afterward. Following the death of Jadzia in the finale, \"Tears of the Prophets\", Farrell suggested that the symbiont could be moved to a male character resulting in a similar situation as \"Rejoined\" between the new Dax host and Worf, as the two were in a relationship at that point. Instead, the symbiont was placed in a new female host called Ezri, as the producers did not want Kira Nerys to be the only female main character. The prejudice against re-association first highlighted in \"Rejoined\" was mentioned in the episodes such as \"\".\n\nVisual effect supervisors Gary Hutzel and Glenn Neufeld were busy completing post-production work on the opening episode of the fourth season, \"\". In their place, visual effects coordinator David Takemura led on the visual effects work on both \"Rejoined\" and \"\". For this episode, his two main tasks were the creation of the artificial wormhole and the sequence where Dax uses a forcefield as a walkway to reach a trapped Kahn. Takemura was relieved that the wormhole was intended to be artificial in nature, as it meant that he did not have to attempt to re-create the detail already seen in the Bajoran wormhole on the series. Once he came up with the basic design, visual effects company VisionArt completed it.\n\nFor the forcefield scene, Farrell was shot \"skating\" down a board painted blue against a blue screen. A mixture of liquid nitrogen and hot water was used to create a fog around the ground. VisionArt combined these shots with the force field and footage of the engineering set on board the \"Defiant\", while a staff animator added a \"plasma glow\" around her feet as she made contact with the field.\n\nBefore appearing in \"Rejoined\", Susanna Thompson had previously appeared in two \"The Next Generation\" episodes; \"The Next Phase\" and \"\". She later appeared in \"\" as the Borg Queen, previously portrayed by Alice Krige in the film \"\". Farrell praised Thompson's part in \"Rejoined\", calling her a \"wonderful actress and a joy to work with\".\n\nWriters on \"Deep Space Nine\" had previously hinted at a potential same-sex relationship in the episode \"\", when Jadzia Dax says goodbye to Enina Tandro, a former lover of Dax's previous male host, Curzon. The first take of the scene resulted in a situation in which it was unclear whether Dax and Enina were about to kiss. It was decided at the time that it was not appropriate, although the writers had hoped that there would be a time when the viewers would accept such a relationship. This theme was eventually realised in \"Rejoined\". Allen Kwan has argued that \"Deep Space Nine\" is the only series of \"Star Trek\" that resists the heteronormativity typical of the franchise at the time, citing both \"Rejoined\" and the Mirror Universe episodes as examples, even if the presented bisexuality is problematized.\n\nDuring that 1995/96 television season there had been an increase in the number of homosexual characters appearing in major television series, and so the same-sex kiss in \"Rejoined\" was reviewed in this context. An article published by the Associated Press suggested that the kiss in \"Deep Space Nine\" was not truly a same-sex kiss due to \"extenuating circumstances\"; namely, one of the characters was an \"alien who used to be a man\". A similar opinion was offered by Jan Johnson-Smith, author of \"American Science Fiction TV\", who said that the situation was \"ambiguous\" as, despite presenting a same-sex kiss, the episode was clear that Jadzia was \"actually kissing the symbiont who has the memories of the former host, her male lover, not the current female host\".\n\nFor film studies scholar Jean Bruce, the ambiguity of the kiss is foreshadowed in an early scene revolving around a magic trick. On the one hand, the magic trick produces a \"pleasurable surprise\", while, on the other, this mirrors the deception necessary, due to Trill norms, in the reacquaintance of the characters. At the same time, the juxtaposition of very different shots serves to \"convey physical distance and the desire to bridge it\", which mirrors the fact that the Trills' love for one another transcends gender, identity and death. Though the kiss is \"informed by the fact that Dax was a man in her past life\", once it occurs, it can \"never be taken back\", and remains the queer image of two women kissing.\n\nNonetheless, \"Rejoined\" was still considered controversial because of its subject matter, which depicts two women who engage in a same-sex romantic relationship, and included one of the first televised lesbian kisses. During the course of the episode, no characters register concern about Dax being involved with a woman, only that she was an ex-spouse. David Greven, literary critic and author of \"Gender and Sexuality in Star Trek\", said that \"Rejoined\" was one of the better-received episodes of \"Star Trek\" that dealt with homosexuality as a theme, but that the franchise overall had typically avoided LGBT issues. Bryan Fuller, who also wrote for \"Deep Space Nine\", said that the franchise had usually avoided those story lines because of the paranoia of the studio regarding homosexuality. Dale Palmer, in an essay on gender and sexual politics, suggested that the choice was made to have a female same-sex kiss on screen because a male one would have alienated the main viewer demographic for the series: heterosexual men.\n\n\"Rejoined\" was first broadcast on October 30, 1995, in broadcast syndication. It received Nielsen ratings of 7 percent, placing it in eighth place in its timeslot. This was lower than the share received by \"Indiscretion\", broadcast in the week prior with a 7.2 percent share and \"\" in the week afterward with 7.7 percent.\n\nWhen the episode was originally broadcast, there was a strong negative reaction from some viewers. As \"Deep Space Nine\" was shown in syndication, one channel in the Southern United States took the step of editing out the kiss from the initial broadcast. Echevarria's mother told him that they should have issued a parental guidance warning before broadcasting it. More responses were received at the production office from viewers than for any other episode of the series, resulting in several staff members having to take turns on the phones in order to cover the load. The staff found that although the majority of the phone calls were negative about \"Rejoined\", the letters were mostly positive. Terry Farrell said in a 2015 interview that \"Rejoined\" was her favourite episode of all time and that she still had people thanking her for the episode, because \"it gave them strength, and that it made them feel like they weren't alone, it inspired them to be themselves—all the things I was hoping it would do.\"\n\nZack Handlen reviewed the episode for \"The A.V. Club\" in 2013, praising the natural manner in which the romance was progressed, saying that this was \"refreshing\" to see. He felt that the relationship did not appear to be manipulative for the sake of male viewers, but added that the ending was expected and that the episode never communicated to the audience the need to care about the duo. Handlen wrote that the overall story itself was \"shallow\", as the episode suffered from an \"enervating lack of fun\" which was only saved from \"complete tedium\" through \"strong acting and an admirable lack of stigma\". Jordon Hoffman, reviewing the episode on his website, commented that Farrell's acting \"really steps up to the plate\" for this episode, and gave \"Rejoined\" a rating of five out of five.\n\nKeith DeCandido, in 2014 review on Tor.com, compared \"Rejoined\" structurally to \"The Next Generation\" episode \"\", which also had a \"love-interest-in-danger climax\". He praised the episode, saying that at the time of broadcast it was considered \"radical\" and said that both Farrell and Thompson managed to get across the romantic message. He called it a \"\"Trek\" message\" episode, but said that it was one of the better ones as it \"shines a light on an inadequacy in our own culture via an alien culture, but in this case it muddies the waters a bit because the taboo actually makes sense on the face of it\". He gave \"Rejoined\" a rating of eight out of ten.\n\nIn 2018, SyFy included this episode on their Jadzia Dax binge-watching guide for this character.\n\nDara Gellman, an independent Canadian video artist, used the kiss sequence in \"Rejoined\" as the basis of her 3-minute 1999 project \"alien kisses\". In this piece, the kiss scene is manipulated—the video is slowed, the image enlarged and digitized—and trance music is added. New media scholar Carolyn Guertin argues that this serves to make the footage \"even more alien\", presenting queerness as \"unearthly\". Jean Bruce argues that, despite the inherent ambiguity of the scene in the episode, \"the image is still one of two women kissing, which opens up the possibilities of queer desire on its own terms\". Similarly, Guertin argues that Gellman translates the (not truly queer) scene into an \"expression of gay love that is alien and apart, but no less erotic for being so\". In using the scene in isolation, \"alien kisses\", Bruce argues, \"strips away the gender equivocation by imposing a new queer vision\". She suggests that \"alien kisses\" works as an \"antidote\" to the \"ultimately tame treatment\" \"Star Trek\" has offered of queer themes, and as a \"suggestion\" that \"Star Trek\" acknowledge the desires of queer viewers and fans \"beyond the occasional titillating episode\".\n\nThe first home media release of \"Rejoined\" was on a VHS cassette alongside \"Indiscretion\" on March 25, 1996, in the United Kingdom. The first release within the United States was on a single-episode VHS release on August 1, 2000. It was released on DVD as part of the season four box set on August 5, 2003.\n\n"}

However, it was in the Islamic Golden Age when Baghdad was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate (750–1258) that the Iraqi kitchen reached its zenith.\n\nMeals begin with appetizers and salads – known as \"Mezza\". Some dishes include \"Kebab\" (often marinated with garlic, lemon and spices, then grilled), \"Gauss\" (grilled meat sandwich wrap, similar to \"Döner kebab\"), \"Bamieh\" (lamb, okra and tomato stew), \"Quzi\" (lamb with rice, almonds, raisins and spices), \"Falafel\" (fried chickpea patties served with \"amba\" and salad in \"pita\"), \"Kubbah/Kibbeh\" (minced meat ground with bulghur wheat or rice and spices), \"Masgûf\" (grilled fish with pepper and tamarind), and \"Maqluba\" (a rice, lamb, tomato and aubergine dish). Stuffed vegetable dishes such as \"Dolma\" and \"Mahshi\" are also popular.\n\nContemporary Iraq reflects the same natural division as ancient Mesopotamia, which consisted of Assyria in the arid northern uplands and Babylonia in the southern alluvial plain. \"Al-Jazira\" (the ancient Assyria) grows wheat and crops requiring winter chill such as apples and stone fruits. \"Al-Irāq\" (Iraq proper, the ancient Babylonia) grows rice and barley, citrus fruits, and is responsible for Iraq's position as the world's largest producer of dates.\n\nPork consumption is forbidden to Muslims in Iraq, in accordance with Sharia, the Islamic law.\n\nArchaeologists have found evidence from excavations at Jarmo in northeastern Iraq, that pistachio nuts were a common food as early as 6750 BC.\n\nAmong the ancient texts discovered in Iraq is a Sumerian-Akkadian bilingual dictionary, recorded in cuneiform script on 24 stone tablets about 1900 BC. It lists terms in the two ancient Iraqi languages for over 800 different items of food and drink. Included are 20 different kinds of cheese, over 100 varieties of soup and 300 types of bread – each with different ingredients, filling, shape or size.\n\nOne of three excavated cuneiform clay tablets written in 1700 BC in Babylon, 50 miles south of present-day Baghdad, deals with 24 recipes for stew cooked with meat and vegetables, enhanced and seasoned with leeks, onion, garlic, and spices and herbs like cassia, cumin, coriander, mint, and dill. Stew has remained a mainstay in the cuisine. Extant medieval Iraqi recipes and modern Iraqi cuisine attest to this.\n\nSome characteristic ingredients of Iraqi cuisine include:\n\nOther Iraqi culinary essentials include olive oil, sesame oil, tamarind, vermicelli, tahini, honey, date syrup, yogurt and rose water. Lamb is the favorite meat, but chicken, beef and goat and fish are also eaten. Most dishes are served with rice – usually \"timman anbar\", a yellowish, very aromatic, long-grain rice grown in the provinces of Anbar and Qadisiyyah. Bulghur wheat is used in many dishes, having been a staple in the country since the days of the ancient Assyrians. Flatbread is a staple that is served, with a variety of dips, cheeses, olives, and jams, at every meal.\n\nMezza is a selection of appetizers or small dishes often served with beverage, like anise-flavored liqueurs such as arak, ouzo, raki or different wines, similar to the tapas of Spain or finger food.\n\n\nVarious stews served over rice form a major part of Iraqi cuisine. A feature shared with Iranian (or Persian) cuisine (see Khoresht).\nBeans and Fries\n\n\n\nLong-grain rice is a staple in Iraqi cuisine.\n\nIraqi rice cooking is similar to the method used for Iranian \"chelow\", a multistep process intended to produce just-tender, fluffy grains. A prominent aspect of Iraqi rice cooking is the \"hkaka\", a crisp bottom crust. It differs slightly from the Iranian \"tahdig\", which is a single thick piece; the \"hkaka\" contains some loose rice as well. Before serving, the \"hkaka\" is broken into pieces so that everyone is provided with some along with the fluffy rice.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe earliest known recipe for cake comes from ancient Mesopotamia. Believed to be primarily for consumption at the palace or temple, the cake was made from fat, white cheese, dates and raisins. Another recipe dating to the reign of Hammurabi (1792 BCE - 1750 BCE) includes similar basic ingredients with the addition of grape syrup, figs and apples.\n\nThe traditional Iraqi \"kleicha\" cookies are believed to have their roots in Mesopotamian \"qullupu\"—date filled pastries baked in a wood-fired oven called \"tannour\". In modern times, other types of cookies (\"biskit\") and cakes (\"ka'ak\") are made at home, usually flavored with cardamom or rose water. Some variations include the disc-shaped \"khfefiyyat\", half-moon shaped \"kleichat joz\" made with nuts, and date filled \"kleichat tamur\".\nCookbooks dating to the Abbasid Caliphate between the 10th and 13th centuries include recipes for hundreds of desserts. The tradition continues into the modern day, but the rich, syrupy desserts like \"baklava\" are usually prepared for special occasions or religious celebrations, as most daily meals are usually followed by a simple course of seasonal fruit, especially dates, figs, cantaloupes, nectarines, apricots, pomegranates, peaches, mulberries, grapes or watermelons.\n\nThough not as recognizable as \"baklava\", the fried pastry called \"lauzeenaj\", flavored with mastic and rose water, was a specialty in imperial Baghdad. Rosette-shaped fritters called \"zalabia\" are a local specialty, believed to take their name from Ziryab, a well-known Kurdish-Iraqi musician in the Caliphate of Cordoba. \"Baklava\" and \"zalabia\" are typical offerings during the Eid al-Fitr celebrations that follow Ramadan. \"Halqoum\" (commonly known as Turkish Delights) are traditionally given as gifts during the holiday.\n\n\n\n\n"}

His complicated relationship with his cousin, Ivan the Terrible, was dramatized in Sergei Eisenstein's movie \"Ivan the Terrible\".\n\nThe only son of Andrey of Staritsa and Princess Evfrosinia Staritskaia \"née\" Khovanskaia, Vladimir spent his childhood under strict surveillance in Moscow. In 1542, he was reinstated in his father's appanages, Staritsa and Vereya. There he married and lived in peace until 1553, when the tsar fell mortally ill.\n\nDuring the final crisis of Ivan's illness, most boyars refused to swear fealty to his baby son and decided to put Vladimir on the throne instead. To their dismay, the tsar rapidly recovered, but a great change took place in his behaviour and manners. He summoned Vladimir to Moscow and signed with him a treaty whereby Vladimir was to live in Moscow with a small retinue and avoid contacts with Ivan's boyars. In the event of the tsar's death, Vladimir was to become regent for his minor son. \n\nAfter Vladimir's mother was forced to take the veil and his boyars exiled, Ivan permitted Vladimir to marry Princess Eudoxia Romanovna Odoevskaya in April 1555. With the start of Oprichnina, however, Ivan's suspicions against his cousin were resuscitated. In 1564 the Oprichniks burnt Vladimir's palace in Moscow, and most of his lands were confiscated into Oprichnina. In 1569, accused of high treason by Ivan IV, Vladimir and his children were forced to take poison at Ivan's residence of Alexandrov. His mother and wife, who resided at the Goritsy Convent near Vologda, were forcibly drowned in the Sheksna River several days later.\n\nThe extermination of Vladimir's family precipitated the extinction of the Rurik Dynasty and the dynastic crisis known as the Time of Troubles. Vladimir's only surviving daughter, Maria, was married in 1573 to king Magnus of Livonia (son of Christian III of Denmark). Upon her husband's death, she was summoned from Courland to the court of Boris Godunov and forced to take the veil in a convent adjacent to the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra. In 1609, Maria entered into correspondence with her false cousin who had proclaimed himself tsar. Her subsequent fate is not documented.\n"}

{"id": "2322127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322127", "title": "Livestrong Foundation", "text": "Livestrong Foundation\n\nThe Livestrong Foundation is a United States nonprofit organization that provides support for people affected by cancer. The foundation, based in Austin, Texas, was established in 1997 by cancer survivor and former professional road racing cyclist Lance Armstrong, as the Lance Armstrong Foundation. The Livestrong brand was launched by the foundation in 2003. Armstrong resigned from the foundation in 2012 after his admission of doping, leading to the rebranding of the entire organization as Livestrong Foundation. \n\nAmong its activities, the foundation lobbies governmental agencies, conducts research on cancer survivors, and funds a number of smaller non-profit organizations. The cornerstone of the foundation's work was the providing of free, direct, personalized support services for people navigating the physical, practical, emotional and financial challenges of having cancer. In this effort, the foundation aimed to make the cancer care system more patient-focused. As of 2020, the foundation has shifted its focus away from \"direct services\", and has positioned itself as a backer of companies involved in improving patient care.\n\nThe foundation states that its mission is \"to improve the lives of cancer survivors and those affected by cancer\". The foundation implements its mission through direct services, community programs and systemic change. As early as 1999, the foundation began focusing on the field of cancer survivorship, specifically the practical, psycho-social needs of cancer patients and those affected by cancer. In 2000, the foundation funded cancer survivorship programs at Children's Medical Center in Ft. Worth, TX and the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA.\n\nIn 2001, the foundation awarded its first community program grant through a program that would ultimately become the \"Community Impact Project\". The first grant was awarded to \"Wonders and Worries\", a pilot program to help children cope when a parent has a chronic or life-threatening illness like cancer. Future recipients of the Community Impact Project include the \"LIVESTRONG at the YMCA\", \"Camp Kesem\", \"Pablove Shutterbugs\", and \"Cancer Transitions\".\n\nIn 2002, the foundation launched Livestrong Survivorcare, the predecessor to Livestrong Navigation, a free one-on-one service offering cancer navigation services to patients, caregivers, friends and family members through phone, email and online services. The foundationwould ultimately open the Livestrong Cancer Navigation Center at its headquarters in Austin by 2010. Since its inception, Livestrong has served over 100,000 people through free programs and services such as emotional counseling, insurance management, clinical trial matching and guidance on treatment options.\n\nIn 2008, Demand Media reached an agreement with the foundation to license the use of the Livestrong name and mark to create a spin-off website, Livestrong.com (unconnected to Livestrong.org), a commercial health and wellness site. Demand Media hired Armstrong as a spokesman.\n\nIn 2012, Armstrong was banned from professional cycling and stripped of his Tour de France titles after it was found that he had engaged in the use of performance-enhancing drugs. The foundation initially reacted by questioning the integrity of the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) in a statement by president and chief executive Doug Ulman released in October 2012:Our long-standing concerns about the impartiality and fairness of Usada's proceedings are compounded today. ... Usada appears motivated more by publicity rather than fulfilling its mission. ... Because of [Armstrong's] leadership and vision, the Lance Armstrong Foundation has served more than 2.5 million people affected by cancer over the last 15 years. ... We are deeply grateful for his leadership and incredibly proud of his achievements, both on and off the bike.However, just a week later, Amstrong resigned as chairman of the foundation, and from the foundation's board of directors in November. In January 2013, prior to Armstrong's televised interview with Oprah Winfrey in which he admitted to doping, the foundation released a statement that said:\n\nWe expect Lance to be completely truthful and forthcoming in his interview and with all of us in the cancer community ... Regardless, we are charting a strong, independent course forward that is focused on helping people overcome financial, emotional and physical challenges related to cancer ... Inspired by the people with cancer whom we serve, we feel confident and optimistic about the Foundation's future and welcome an end to speculation.\n\nFollowing the departure of Armstrong, the foundation considered whether its highly visible brand image was a liability, linking the foundation and its activities too tightly with its founder. The conclusion was that a radical change would go against the foundation's key message: \"It has never been about one person.\" The foundation changed its name from the Lance Armstrong Foundation to the Livestrong Foundation in November 2012. This decision and the strategy it adopted was primarily driven by the foundation's own \"strong sense of itself\" and the \"importance of its story.\" In the end, in a process some critics called \"subtle but substantive,\" the foundation's story was told through a variety of ongoing initiatives explaining the foundation's key promise, which was designed to help distinguish the organization from other organizations in the oncology community.\n\nAs a result of Armstrong's confessed guilt, on May 28, 2013, Nike announced that it would cut ties with the foundation after a nine-year relationship. After the 2013 holiday season, Nike ceased production of its Livestrong line of products, honoring its contract with the organization which expired in 2014.\n\nThe foundation was a title sponsor of Major League Soccer club Sporting Kansas City's home stadium from March 2011 to January 2013, when the naming agreement was terminated. The deal was severed after both sides blamed the other for failing to live up to their agreement; Armstrong's doping scandal was not a factor in the decision.\n\nIn 2015, Livestrong hired Chandini Portteus as their new president and CEO. She formerly worked at the Susan G. Komen Foundation.\n\nIn 2016, Portteus resigned and Greg Lee was appointed as President. Greg Lee had served as CFO of the Foundation for over ten years.\n\nIn February 2020, the foundation announced that it would change its focus to being an \"impact funder\" rather than a provider of direct services, backing startups involved in improving patient care. The foundation also unveiled a new logo, moving away from its previous yellow-and-black imagery (which was strongly associated with Armstrong and its wristbands). Lee stated that the new brand was intended to reflect that Livestrong was \"more than a wristband\".\n\nThe \"Livestrong wristband\" is a yellow silicone gel bracelet program launched in May 2004 as a fund-raising item. The bracelet was developed by Nike and its advertising agency, Wieden+Kennedy; its yellow color references the Tour de France's general classification for the overall leader, who traditionally wears a yellow jersey. The band became a popular fashion item in the United States by the end of the summer of 2004 and appeared on a majority of the contenders at the 2004 Tour de France.\n\nBy 2013, 80 million Livestrong bracelets had been sold (according to Oprah). They have inspired several other charitable organizations to start their own bracelet selling programs. Following Armstrong's lifetime ban for doping by USADA, a CNN article claimed that critics had struck out the \"V\" or wrote a \"W\" over the \"ST\" to make the wristband read \"LIE STRONG\" or \"LIVEWRONG\".\n\nFigures provided by the foundation to ESPN in October 2012 revealed that, despite Armstrong's acknowledgement that he doped, revenues were up 2.1 percent, to US$33.8 million, through September 30, 2012—according to ESPN, this total represented a 5.4 percent increase from 2011, with a 5.7 percent increase in the average dollar amount of those donations (from US$74.88 in 2011 to US$79.15 in 2012). Over the duration of its existence, the foundation has generated more than US$500 million worth of funds.\n\nSince Armstrong's departure, the foundation's income has continued to drop. The foundation revealed that its 2013 budget was 10.9 percent less than its 2012 budget, and annual reports from the foundation show a continuous drop in revenue with annual contributions falling from $15.8 million in 2011 to $10.7 million in 2012, $7.9 million in 2013, $3.8 million in 2014, $6.7 million in 2015, $4.2 million in 2016, $3.5 million in 2017, and $3.2 million in 2018, Income from licensing and royalties also declined dramatically, from a high of $7.2 million in 2007 to a low of $13.9 thousand in 2017.\n\n"}

The chemical structure of piperacillin and other ureidopenicillins incorporates a polar side chain that enhances penetration into gram-negative bacteria and reduces susceptibility to cleavage by gram-negative beta lactamase enzymes. These properties confer activity against the important hospital pathogen \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\". Thus piperacillin is sometimes referred to as an \"anti-pseudomonal penicillin\".\n\nWhen used alone, piperacillin lacks strong activity against the gram-positive pathogens such as \"Staphylococcus aureus\", as the beta-lactam ring is hydrolyzed by the bacteria's beta-lactamase.\nIt was patented in 1974 and approved for medical use in 1981. Piperacillin is most commonly used in combination with the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam (piperacillin/Tazobactam), which enhances piperacillin's effectiveness by inhibiting many beta lactamases to which it is susceptible. However, the co-administration of tazobactam does not confer activity against MRSA, as penicillins (and most other beta lactams) do not avidly bind to the penicillin-binding proteins of this pathogen.\n\nPiperacillin is used almost exclusively in combination with the beta lactamase inhibitor tazobactam for the treatment of serious, hospital-acquired infections. This combination is among the most widely used drug therapies in United States non-federal hospitals, accounting for $388M in spending in spite of being a low-cost generic drug.\n\nPiperacillin-tazobactam is recommended as part of a three drug regimen for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia suspected as being due to infection by multi-drug resistant pathogens. It is also one of several antibacterials recommended for the treatment of infections known to be caused by anaerobic gram-negative rods.\n\nPiperacillin-tazobactam is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence as initial empiric treatment for people with suspected neutropenic sepsis.\n\nPiperacillin is not absorbed orally, and must therefore be given by intravenous or intramuscular injection. It has been shown that the bactericidal actions of the drug do not increase with concentrations of piperacillin higher than 4-6 x MIC, which means that the drug is concentration-independent in terms of its actions. Piperacillin has instead shown to offer higher bactericidal activity when its concentration remains above the MIC for longer periods of time (50% time>MIC showing the highest activity). This higher activity present in continuous dosing has not been directly linked to clinical outcomes, but however does show promise of lowering possibility of resistance and decreasing mortality.\n"}

According to oral tradition, the style was developed by Fang Qiniang (方七娘; Amoy Min Nan: Hng Chhit-niâ), a female martial artist. It is associated with traditional fighting techniques, including long range, but is most similar to close-quarter or hand-to-hand combat. It is most recognizable by the way the fighter imitates a bird's pecking or flapping of wings. While some white crane styles make use of traditional weapons, others have discontinued the use of weaponry.\n\nFujian White Crane is descends in part from Shaolin Boxing and imitates characteristics of the white Crane. This system is separate though related to ol Lohan (Fukien shaolin).The entire system of fighting was developed from observing the crane's movements, methods of attack and spirit. Crane movements do exist in southern shaolin but the relation is unclear at best.\n\nQīniáng and her father lived in Yongchun County, Fujian province, where many cranes live. Qīniáng's father knew the Southern Chinese Martial Arts and taught them to his daughter. One day, while Qīniáng was doing her chores, a crane landed nearby. Qīniáng tried to scare the bird off using a stick and the skills she had learned from her father, but whatever she did, the crane would counter. Qīniáng tried to hit the crane on the head, but the bird moved its head out of the way and blocked the stick with its wings. Qīniáng tried to hit the crane's wings, but the crane stepped to the side and blocked the stick with its claws. Qīniáng tried to poke the crane's body, but the crane dodged backwards and struck the stick with its beak. From then on, Qīniáng carefully studied the crane's movements. She combined these movements with techniques learned from her father, ultimately creating the White Crane Style.\n\nThere are many versions of this legend. In some the crane does not block a stick, but evades and counters it. The point of the style is to emphasize evasion and attack an opponent's vulnerabilities instead of using physical strength. Since it was created by a woman, White Crane fighting elements are especially popular in women's self-defense training because the movements do not require great strength. They more closely imitate the delicate pecking motion associated with this fighting style. Popular karate bunkai (breakdown) of white crane katas like hakutsuru stress vital point striking or kyusho.\n\nFrom the original Yǒngchūn White Crane style, five additional styles branched off over time:\nAccording to the traditions of the Lee family branch of Flying Crane, Fāng Qīniáng was born in the mid-17th century. She learned kung fu form her father, a lay shaolin disciple. One day she saw a huge crane and attacked it with a stick. As she was unable to defeat it, she realized the crane had come to teach her, and developed her own unique techniques from the experience. She had four principal students who later developed four main branches of Fujian White Crane: Eating, Crying, Sleeping, and Flying. Many systems evolved from each of the four original types of White Crane. At least in the Flying Crane tradition, Fang never married, had children or a husband. Rather, she retired in Bai he an (white crane temple) and taught martial arts.\n\nAccording to the yong chun bai he tradition, the Ong Gong Shr Wushuguan was established in the town of Yongchun (永春; Minnan: eng2 chhun1), prefecture of Quanzhou, Fujian province, when its founders were taught by Fang Qiniang during the reign of the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–66) of the Ming dynasty.\n\nPingyang White Crane was created by Fāng Qī Niáng during Shunzhi period during the Qing dynasty. During Jiaqing period, this kongfu spread to Pingyang city.\n\nYongchun-style White Crane was created by Fāng Qī Niáng during KangXi period during the Qing dynasty.\n\nLi Wenmao (), an opera performer and leader of the 1854–1856 Red Turban Rebellion in Foshan, is said to have practiced the Yǒngchūn style of White Crane.\n\nThe Xu-Xi Dao style of White Crane as taught by Chen Zhuozhen was derived from Zhong-Ho 'Springing Crane', and was developed in Taiwan by Huang Laoyang in the 1950s.\n\nThe lineage of The Weng Gong Ci Gym in Yongchun County is:\n\nThe lineage of Feeding Crane in Taiwan is:\n\n\n\nFujian White Crane is one of the constituent styles of Five Ancestors, who, in addition to the various styles of Karate (notably Goju-ryu, Shitō-ryū and Uechi-ryu), use the routine \"San Chian\" from Fujian White Crane. San Chian is best known by the Japanese pronunciation of its name, Sanchin.\n\n\n\n"}

The combination has activity against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\". It is used to treat pelvic inflammatory disease, intra-abdominal infection, pneumonia, cellulitis, and sepsis. It is given by injection into a vein.\nCommon adverse effects include headache, trouble sleeping, rash, nausea, constipation, and diarrhea. Serious adverse effects include \"Clostridium difficile\" infection and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. Those who are allergic to other β-lactam are more likely to be allergic to piperacillin/tazobactam. Use in pregnancy or breastfeeding appears to generally be safe. It usually results in bacterial death through blocking their ability to make a cell wall.\nPiperacillin/tazobactam was approved for medical use in the United States in 1993. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world, as of 2015, is about US$11 per day. In the United Kingdom, as of 2015, this amount costs the NHS about 38.70 pounds per day.\n\nIts main uses are in intensive care medicine (pneumonia, peritonitis), some diabetes-related foot infections, and empirical therapy in febrile neutropenia (e.g., after chemotherapy). The drug is administered intravenously every 6 or 8 hr, typically over 3–30 min. It may also be administered by continuous infusion over four hours. Prolonged infusions are thought to maximize the time that serum concentrations are above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the bacteria implicated in infection.\n\nPiperacillin-tazobactam is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence as first line therapy for the treatment of bloodstream infections in neutropenic cancer patients.\n\nFor β-lactam antipseudomonal antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, prolonged intravenous infusion is associated with lower mortality than bolus intravenous infusion in persons with sepsis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n\nThe most common adverse effect is diarrhea (7–11%).

It performed training on the Panavia Tornado for the Royal Air Force, Luftwaffe and Italian Air Force. Initially, pilots received four weeks of training on the ground, followed by nine weeks in the air.\n\nThe Tornado was first shown to the British public on 14 April 1978 at RAF Boscombe Down. The RAF planned to buy 220 of them, and 165 of the ADV variant. 809 for all three countries had been ordered, with 212 for the German Air Force, 112 for the German Navy and 100 for the Italian Air Force. Cost at that time was £7.8m for the GR1 and £9.4m for the ADV. As a historical comparison, a Tornado could carry twice the bomb load of an Avro Lancaster. The plane was chosen above contemporary American aircraft at that time because the F-16 lacked all-weather capability, the F-15 had inferior radar and electronic countermeasures and the F-14 was too expensive. The Tornado was the first RAF plane with an active scanningTerrain Following Radar (TFR). The German Navy was the first to get the planes. When the TTTE was established, the RAF was concerned it may not have enough trained pilots to fly the planes, due to poor recruitment and perceived low pay.\n\nThe memorandum of understanding establishing the unit was signed in 1979 by the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy and the unit came into existence on 29 January 1981 with Sir Michael Beetham in attendance. The first RAF Tornados arrived at the base on 1 July 1980; Luftwaffe Tornados arrived on 2 September 1980; and Italian Tornados arrived much later on 5 April 1982.\n\nAllocation of aircraft was Germany: 23, UK: 19, and Italy: 6. Flying training began on 5 January 1981. It was manned by personnel of all three participating nations, trained 300 crews a year when at its height and consisted of three squadrons of Tornados.\n\nTTTE was a unit of approximately 1,600 military and 130 civilian employees. The Royal Air Force provided technicians and logistics personnel, the staff and the three training squadrons were manned by the three nations. The post of the Wing Commander varied between the three nations.\n\nStaff and students of the three squadrons \"(Tornado Operational Conversion Unit – TOCU)\" were tri-nationally mixed. A-Squadron was headed by a German, B-Squadron by a British and C-Squadron by an Italian squadron commander.\n\n\"Standardization Squadron (S-Squadron)\" was responsible for follow-on training, training of instructor pilots and conducting check flights. Theory lessons and simulator training was conducted by \"Ground School\".\n\nCost sharing followed the ratio of flown sorties: 40:40:20 (Germany/Great Britain/Italy).\n\nIn the post-Cold War era and the growing differences in the aircraft variants, the three nations decided that they would be better served performing their own type training. There was also a need to find space for British aircraft returning to the UK from bases in Germany, such as RAF Bruggen, that were closing. Consequently, the unit disbanded on 24 February 1999, with Tornado flying ending on 31 March 1999.\n\nAfter TTTE, Cottesmore became the base for Joint Force Harrier. The station housed all the operational Harrier GR9 squadrons in the Royal Air Force, and No 122 Expeditionary Air Wing. In April 2012 RAF Cottesmore was transferred to the Army and renamed Kendrew Barracks\n\nWhile the Eurofighter project has followed the example of the Tornado programme in many ways, the TTTE model was not adopted. Rather the Eurofighter partners (Germany, Italy, Spain and United Kingdom) have chosen to run national training schemes.\n\n"}
{"id": "2322153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322153", "title": "Carbon offset", "text": "Carbon offset\n\nA carbon offset is a reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases made in order to compensate for emissions made elsewhere. Offsets are measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent (COe). One tonne of carbon offset represents the reduction of one tonne of carbon dioxide or its equivalent in other greenhouse gases.\n\nThere are two markets for carbon offsets. In the larger, compliance market, companies, governments, or other entities buy carbon offsets in order to comply with caps on the total amount of carbon dioxide they are allowed to emit. For instance, an entity could be complying with obligations of Annex 1 Parties under the Kyoto Protocol or of liable entities under the EU Emission Trading Scheme, among others. In 2006, about $5.5 billion of carbon offsets were purchased in the compliance market, representing about 1.6 billion metric tons of COe reductions.\n\nIn the much smaller, voluntary market, individuals, companies, or governments purchase carbon offsets to mitigate their own greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, electricity use, and other sources. For example, an individual might purchase carbon offsets to compensate for the greenhouse gas emissions caused by personal air travel. Carbon offset vendors offer direct purchase of carbon offsets, often also offering other services such as designating a carbon offset project to support or measuring a purchaser's carbon footprint. In 2016, about $191.3 million of carbon offsets were purchased in the voluntary market, representing about 63.4 million metric tons of COe reductions.\n\nOffsets typically support projects that reduce the emission of greenhouse gases in the short- or long-term. A common project type is renewable energy, such as wind farms, biomass energy, biogas digesters, or hydroelectric dams. Others include energy efficiency projects like efficient cookstoves, the destruction of industrial pollutants or agricultural byproducts, destruction of landfill methane, and forestry projects. Some of the most popular carbon offset projects from a corporate perspective are energy efficiency and wind turbine projects.\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol has sanctioned offsets as a way for governments and private companies to earn carbon credits that can be traded on a marketplace. The protocol established the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which validates and measures projects to ensure they produce authentic benefits and are genuinely \"additional\" activities that would not otherwise have been undertaken. Organizations that are unable to meet their emissions quota can offset their emissions by buying CDM-approved Certified Emissions Reductions.\n\nOffsets may be cheaper or more convenient alternatives to reducing one's own fossil-fuel consumption. However, some critics object to carbon offsets, and question the benefits of certain types of offsets.\nDue diligence is recommended to help businesses in the assessment and identification of \"good quality\" offsets to ensure offsetting provides the desired additional environmental benefits, and to avoid reputational risk associated with poor quality offsets.\n\nOffsets are viewed as an important policy tool to maintain stable economies and to improve sustainability. One of the hidden dangers of climate change policy is unequal prices of carbon in the economy, which can cause economic collateral damage if production flows to regions or industries that have a lower price of carbon—unless carbon can be purchased from that area, which offsets effectively permit, equalizing the price.\n\nCarbon offsets represent multiple categories of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (), methane (CH), nitrous oxide (NO), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF).\n\nCarbon offsets have several common features:\n\n\nIn 2009, 8.2 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent changed hands worldwide, up 68 per cent from 2008, according to the study by carbon-market research firm Point Carbon, of Washington and Oslo. But at EUR94 billion, or about $135 billion, the market's value was nearly unchanged compared with 2008, with world carbon prices averaging EUR11.40 a ton, down about 40 per cent from the previous year, according to the study. The World Bank's \"State and Trends of the Carbon Market 2010\" put the overall value of the market at $144 billion, but found that a significant part of this figure resulted from manipulation of a VAT loophole.\n\n\nThe global carbon market is dominated by the European Union, where companies that emit greenhouse gases are required to cut their emissions or buy pollution allowances or carbon credits from the market, under the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). Europe, which has seen volatile carbon prices due to fluctuations in energy prices and supply and demand, will continue to dominate the global carbon market for another few years, as the U.S. and China—the world's top polluters—have yet to establish mandatory emission-reduction policies.\n\nOn the whole, the U.S. market remains primarily a voluntary market, but multiple cap and trade regimes are either fully implemented or near-imminent at the regional level. The first mandatory, market-based cap-and-trade program to cut CO in the U.S., called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), kicked into gear in Northeastern states in 2009, growing nearly tenfold to $2.5 billion, according to Point Carbon. Western Climate Initiative (WCI)—a regional cap-and-trade program including seven western states (California notably among them) and four Canadian provinces—has established a regional target for reducing heat-trapping emissions of 15 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. A component of California's own Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, kicked off in early 2013, requires high-emissions industries to purchase carbon credits to cover emissions in excess of 25,000 CO2 metric tons. \n\nCarbon offset projects in the U.K. are only available for the voluntary market, due to UN protocols on CERs. Woodland creation and Peatland restoration are the two types of offset scheme in the UK which have recognised validation codes, through the Woodland Carbon Code and Peatland Code respectively. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2015, the UNFCCC created a dedicated website where organizations, companies, but also private persons are able to offset their footprint with the aim of facilitating everyone's participation in the process of promoting sustainability on a voluntary basis.\n\nThe CDM identifies over 200 types of projects suitable for generating carbon offsets, which are grouped into broad categories. These project types include renewable energy, methane abatement, energy efficiency, reforestation and fuel switching (i.e. to carbon-neutral fuels and carbon-negative fuels).\n\nRenewable energy offsets commonly include wind power, solar power, hydroelectric power and biofuel. Some of these offsets are used to reduce the cost differential between renewable and conventional energy production, increasing the commercial viability of a choice to use renewable energy sources. Emissions from burning fuel, such as red diesel, has pushed one UK fuel supplier to create a carbon offset fuel named Carbon Offset Red Diesel.\n\nRenewable Energy Credits (RECs) are also sometimes treated as carbon offsets, although the concepts are distinct. Whereas a carbon offset represents a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a REC represents a quantity of energy produced from renewable sources. To convert RECs into offsets, the clean energy must be translated into carbon reductions, typically by assuming that the clean energy is displacing an equivalent amount of conventionally produced electricity from the local grid. This is known as an indirect offset (because the reduction doesn't take place at the project site itself, but rather at an external site), and some controversy surrounds the question of whether they truly lead to \"additional\" emission reductions and who should get credit for any reductions that may occur. Intel corporation is the largest purchaser of renewable power in the US.\n\nSome offset projects consist of the combustion or containment of methane generated by farm animals (by use of an anaerobic digester), landfills or other industrial waste. Methane has a global warming potential (GWP) 23 times that of CO; when combusted, each molecule of methane is converted to one molecule of CO, thus reducing the global warming effect by 96%.\n\nAn example of a project using an anaerobic digester can be found in Chile where, in December 2000, the largest pork production company in Chile initiated a voluntary process to implement advanced waste management systems (anaerobic and aerobic digestion of hog manure), in order to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\n\nWhile carbon offsets that fund renewable energy projects help lower the carbon intensity of energy \"supply\", energy conservation projects seek to reduce the overall \"demand\" for energy. Carbon offsets in this category fund projects of several types:\n\n\nIndustrial pollutants such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs) have a GWP many thousands of times greater than carbon dioxide by volume. Because these pollutants are easily captured and destroyed at their source, they present a large and low-cost source of carbon offsets. As a category, HFCs, PFCs, and NO reductions represent 71 per cent of offsets issued under the CDM.\n\nLand use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) projects focus on natural carbon sinks such as forests and soil. There are a number of different types of LULUCF projects:\n\n\nDeforestation, particularly in Brazil, Indonesia and parts of Africa, account for about 20 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation can be avoided either by paying directly for forest preservation, or by using offset funds to provide substitutes for forest-based products. There is a class of mechanisms referred to as REDD schemes (Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), which may be included in a post-Kyoto agreement. REDD credits provide carbon offsets for the protection of forests, and provide a possible mechanism to allow funding from developed nations to assist in the protection of native forests in developing nations.\n\nReforestation could support an additional 0.9 billion hectares of continuous forest which could store the equivalent of 25% of the current atmospheric pool. Offset schemes using reforestation are available in developing countries, as well as an increasing number of developed countries including the US and the UK. \n\nAlmost half of the world's people burn wood (or fiber or dung) for their cooking and heating needs. Fuel-efficient cook stoves can reduce fuel wood consumption by 30 to 50%, though the warming of the earth due to decreases in particulate matter (i.e. smoke) from such fuel-efficient stoves has not been addressed.\n\nOnce it has been accredited by the UNFCCC a carbon offset project can be used as carbon credit and linked with official emission trading schemes, such as the European Union Emission Trading Scheme or Kyoto Protocol, as Certified Emission Reductions. European emission allowances for the 2008–2012 second phase were selling for between 21 and 24 Euros per metric ton of CO as of July 2007. \n\nThe voluntary Chicago Climate Exchange also includes a carbon offset scheme that allows offset project developers to sell emissions reductions to CCX members who have voluntarily agreed to meet emissions reduction targets.\n\nThe Western Climate Initiative, a regional greenhouse gas reduction initiative by states and provinces along the western rim of North America, includes an offset scheme. Likewise, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a similar program in the northeastern U.S., includes an offset program. A credit mechanism that uses offsets may be incorporated in proposed schemes such as the Australian Carbon Exchange.\n\nCarbon retirement involves retiring allowances from emission trading schemes as a method for offsetting carbon emissions. Voluntary purchasers can offset their carbon emissions by purchasing carbon allowances from legally mandated cap-and-trade programs such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative or the European Emissions Trading Scheme. By purchasing the allowances that power plants, oil refineries, and industrial facilities need to hold to comply with a cap, voluntary purchases tighten the cap and force additional emissions reductions.\n\nVoluntary purchases can also be made through small-scale and sometimes uncertified schemes such as those offered at South African based Promoting Access to Carbon Equity Centre (PACE), which nevertheless offer clear services such as poverty alleviation in the form of renewable energy development. These projects have the potential to develop projects that are either too small or too complicated to benefit from legally mandated cap-and-trade programs.\n\nA UK offset provider set up a carbon offsetting scheme that set up a secondary market for treadle pumps in developing countries. These pumps are used by farmers, using human power, in place of diesel pumps. However, given that treadle pumps are best suited to pumping shallow water, while diesel pumps are usually used to pump water from deep boreholes, it is not clear that the treadle pumps are actually achieving real emissions reductions. Other companies have explored and rejected treadle pumps as a viable carbon offsetting approach due to these concerns.\n\nDue to their indirect nature, many types of offset are difficult to verify. Some providers obtain independent certification that their offsets are accurately measured, to distance themselves from potentially fraudulent competitors. The credibility of the various certification providers is often questioned. Certified offsets may be purchased from commercial or non-profit organizations for US$2.75–99.00 per tonne of CO, due to fluctuations of market price. Annual carbon dioxide emissions in developed countries range from 6 to 23 tons per capita.\n\nAccounting systems differ on precisely what constitutes a valid offset for voluntary reduction systems and for mandatory reduction systems. However formal standards for quantification exist based on collaboration between emitters, regulators, environmentalists and project developers. These standards include the Voluntary Carbon Standard, Plan Vivo Foundation, Green-e Climate, Chicago Climate Exchange and the Gold Standard, the latter of which expands upon the requirements for the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol.\n\nAccounting of offsets may address the following basic areas:\n\n\nWhile the primary goal of carbon offsets is to reduce global carbon emissions, many offset projects also claim to lead to improvements in the quality of life for a local population. These additional improvements are termed \"co-benefits\", and may be considered when evaluating and comparing carbon offset projects. For example, possible co-benefits from a project that replaces wood-burning stoves with ovens using a less carbon-intensive fuel could include:\n\n\nOffset projects can also lead to co-benefits such as better air and water quality, and healthier communities.\n\nIn a recent survey conducted by EcoSecurities, Conservation International, CCBA and ClimateBiz, of the 120 corporates surveyed more than 77 per cent rated community and environmental benefits as the prime motivator for purchasing carbon offsets.\n\nCarbon offset projects can also negatively affect quality of life. For example, people who earn their livelihoods from collecting firewood and selling it to households could become unemployed if firewood is no longer used. A July 2007 paper from the Overseas Development Institute offers some indicators to be used in assessing the potential developmental impacts of voluntary carbon offset schemes:\n\nPutting a price on carbon encourages innovation by providing funding for new ways to reduce greenhouse gases in many sectors. Carbon reduction goals drive the demand for offsets and carbon trading, encouraging the development of this new industry and offering opportunities for different sectors to develop and use innovative new technologies.\n\nCarbon offset projects also provide savings – energy efficiency measures may reduce fuel or electricity consumption, leading to a potential reduction in maintenance and operating costs.\n\nThe UNFCCC has created a dedicated website where CDM activities and prior consideration projects are able to report their co-benefits on a voluntary basis.\n\nIn an effort to inform and safeguard business and household consumers purchasing Carbon Offsets, in 2009, the UK Government has launched a scheme for regulating Carbon offset products. DEFRA have created the \"Approved Carbon Offsetting\" brand to use as an endorsement on offsets approved by the UK government.\nThe Scheme sets standards for best practice in offsetting. Approved offsets have to demonstrate the following criteria:\nThe first company to qualify for the scheme was Clear, followed by Carbon Footprint, Carbon Passport, Pure, British Airways and Carbon Retirement Ltd.\n\nOn 20 May 2011 the Department of Energy and Climate Change announced that the Quality Assurance Scheme would close on 30 June 2011. The stated purpose of the Quality Assurance Scheme was 'to provide a straightforward route for those wishing to offset their emissions to identify quality offsets'. Critics of the closure therefore argued that without the scheme, businesses and individuals would struggle to identify quality carbon offsets.\n\nIn 2012 the scheme was relaunched as the Quality Assurance Standard (QAS). The QAS is now run independently by Quality Assurance Standard Ltd which is a company limited by guarantee based in the United Kingdom. The Quality Assurance Standard is an independent audit system for carbon offsets, assessing multiple criteria. Approved offsets are checked against a 40-point checklist.\n\nOn 17 July 2012, the first organisations were approved as meeting the new QAS.\n\nThe Australian government's Emissions Reduction Fund provides for purchasing carbon offsets from Australian carbon emissions reduction projects. The Government has committed a total of $4.55 billion to the Fund. \n\nIn 2009, Carbon Retirement reported that less than 30 pence in every pound spent on some carbon offset schemes goes directly to the projects designed to reduce emissions. The figures reported by the BBC and based on UN data reported that typically 28p goes to the set up and maintenance costs of an environmental project. 34p goes to the company that takes on the risk that the project may fail. The project's investors take 19p, with smaller amounts of money being distributed between organisations involved in brokering and auditing the carbon credits. In that respect carbon offsets are similar to most consumer products, with only a fraction of sale prices going to the off-shore producers, the rest being shared between investors and distributors who bring it to the markets, who themselves need to pay their employees and service providers such as advertising agencies most of the time located in expensive areas.\n\nSome activists disagree with the principle of carbon offsets, likening them to Roman Catholic indulgences, a way for the guilty to pay for absolution rather than changing their behavior. George Monbiot, an English environmentalist and writer, says that carbon offsets are an excuse for business as usual with regard to pollution. Proponents hold that the indulgence analogy is flawed because they claim carbon offsets actually reduce carbon emissions, changing the business as usual, and therefore address the root cause of climate change. Proponents of offsets claim that third-party certified carbon offsets are leading to increased investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency, methane biodigesters and reforestation and avoided deforestation projects, and claim that these alleged effects are the intended goal of carbon offsets. Ecosystem Marketplace reported in 2016 that companies that purchased carbon offsets were likely to be engaged in an overall carbon reduction strategy, not simply buying their way out of emissions.\n\nIn October 2009 responsibletravel.com, once a strong voice in favour of carbon offsetting, announced that it would no longer offer carbon offsetting to its clients, stating that \"too often offsets are being used by the tourism industry in developed countries to justify growth plans on the basis that money will be donated to projects in developing countries. Global reduction targets will not be met this way.\"\n\nIn August 2006, the three environmental NGOs Greenpeace, World Wildlife Fund-UK (WWF) and Friends of the Earth declared that carbon offsetting is often used as an \"easy way out for governments, businesses and individuals to continue polluting without making changes to the way they do business or their behaviour\".\n\nOn 4 February 2010, travel networking site Vida Loca Travel announced that they would donate 5 percent of profits to International Medical Corps, as they think that international aid can be more effective at cutting global warming in the long term than carbon offsetting, citing the work of economist Jeffrey Sachs.\n\nSome environmentalist organizations have questioned the effectiveness of tree-planting projects for carbon offset purposes. Critics point to the following issues with tree planting projects:\n\n\nTree-planting projects can cause conflicts with indigenous people who are displaced or otherwise find their use of forest resources curtailed. For example, a World Rainforest Movement report documents land disputes and human rights abuses at Mount Elgon. In March 2002, a few days before receiving Forest Stewardship Council certification for a project near Mount Elgon, the Uganda Wildlife Authority evicted more than 300 families from the area and destroyed their homes and crops. That the project was taking place in an area of on-going land conflict and alleged human rights abuses did not make it into project report.\nA 2011 report by Oxfam International describes a case where over 20,000 farmers in Uganda were displaced for a FSC-certified plantation to offset carbon by London-based New Forests Company\n\nSeveral certification standards exist, offering variations for measuring emissions baseline, reductions, additionality, and other key criteria. However, no single standard governs the industry, and some offset providers have been criticized on the grounds that carbon reduction claims are exaggerated or misleading. Problems include:\n\nBecause offsets provide a revenue stream for the reduction of some types of emissions, they can in some cases provide incentives to emit more, so that emitting entities can later get credit for reducing emissions from an artificially high baseline. This is especially the case for offsets with a high profit margin. For example, one Chinese company generated $500 million in carbon offsets by installing a $5 million incinerator to burn the HFCs produced by the manufacture of refrigerants. The huge profits provided incentive to create new factories or expand existing factories solely for the purpose of increasing production of HFCs and then destroying the resultant pollutants to generate offsets. Not only is this outcome environmentally undesirable, it undermines other offset projects by causing offset prices to collapse. The practice had become so common that offset credits are now no longer awarded for new plants to destroy HFC-23.\n\nIn Nigeria oil companies flare off 40 per cent of the natural gas found. The Agip Oil Company plans to build plants to generate electricity from this gas and thus claim 1.5 million offset credits a year. United States company Pan Ocean Oil Corporation has also applied for credits in exchange for processing its own waste gas in Nigeria. Oilwatch.org's Michael Karikpo calls this \"outrageous\", as flaring is illegal in Nigeria, adding that \"It's like a criminal demanding money to stop committing crimes\".\n\nAlthough many carbon offset projects tout their environmental co-benefits, some are accused of having negative secondary effects. Point Carbon has reported on an inconsistent approach with regard to some hydro-electric projects as carbon offsets; some countries in the EU are not allowing large projects into the EU ETS, because of their environmental impacts, even though they have been individually approved by the UNFCCC and World Commission on Dams. It is difficult to assess the exact results of carbon offsets given the fact that they are a relatively new form of carbon reduction, and it is possible that some carbon offset purchases are made in an attempt to increase positive business public relations rather than to help solve the issue of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nOffset projects may also have negative social impacts, for example when local residents are evicted to enable a National Park to be marketed as a carbon offset.\n\n\n"}

The river Aliakmon flows through the southern part, and through the large reservoir Lake Polyfytos. Lignite is mined in the north, around Ptolemaida.\n\nIts climate ranges from continental to mountainous. Kozani has warm to hot summers and cool winters, cooler than Thessaloniki, the mountainous, the western and the eastern portion receives cold winters and features snow. Its sunshine days are days shorter than the south and by the coastline, it is rainier than the south. Temeperatures ranges from during the summer months.\n\nThe regional unit Kozani is subdivided into 4 municipalities. These are (number as in the map in the infobox):\n\nKozani was created as a prefecture () in 1915. As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the regional unit Kozani was created out of the former prefecture Kozani. The prefecture had the same territory as the present regional unit. At the same time, the municipalities were reorganised, according to the table below.\n\nKozani had three provinces: \n\nThe area was made up of several kingdoms including the ancient Eordaia, it was later ruled by the Kingdom of Macedonia and later, the Roman Empire after the Third Macedonian War, it later became a part of the Byzantine Empire after the breakup into the West and the East, in the early 14th to the 15th century, it was ruled by the Ottoman Empire and lasted until the Balkan Wars of 1913. The Kozani Prefecture was created in 1915 and also included the present Florina, Grevena and the Kastoria regional units.\n\nRefugees from Asia Minor and Pontus during the Greco-Turkish War of 1919 to 1922 brought refugees to the area including Kozani and villages and towns that removed the Turkish population to the country which later became only known as Turkey. The economy boomed and was disrupted later on. After World War II and the Greek Civil War, most of the buildings were repaired. Kozani opened its airport and later its hospital.\n\nKozani has been a prosperous area in the course of its history. Its merchants are known to have dominated the commerce of the Balkan peninsula, expanding their trade activities to the north and along the Danube. Nowadays, Kozani is still among the most prosperous areas of the Greek province, but for a different reason, its rich mining industry. Kozani produces lignite, which is the main source of the electric power produced in Greece, nitrous salts which are processed into fertilizers, and chromium. There was also an asbestos mine that remained operational until the mid-1990s, which has now ceased its operation. In the regional unit of Kozani there is also the artificial lake and hydroelectric dam of Polyfytos, which further contributes to the electricity production of Greece.

The central feature of the league is a game between the same Dynamo and Shakhtar which is developed into the Klasychne (\"Classic\").\n\nOn 15 April 2008 the new Premier-Liha (\"Premier League\") was formed. The new sports organization consists of 12 football club organizations that take control of the league's operations under the statues of Football Federation of Ukraine, UEFA, and FIFA. With the new reorganization the format of the League was preserved, while the changes that were made were exclusively administrative. Competitions continued to be conducted in a double round robin format among 16 clubs. There were couple seasons when the 14-clubs league's composition was experimented. Since the 2014 Russian aggression, the league was reduced to 12 members, while its format also has changed. The season is still being played in a double round robin in the first half of a season, after which the league splits in half into two groups of six (6) teams. Both the top six and the bottom six play another a double round robin tournament with the clubs of own group. For 2019-20 there was also introduced post season play-off for qualification for the European club competitions.\n\nThe teams that reach the top ranks of the competition table at the end of each season as always gain the chance to represent Ukraine internationally in several prestigious tournaments (continental club tournaments). Also at the end of the season, the bottom clubs (usually two) are relegated to the First League (part of the lower Professional Football League) and replaced by the top clubs from that league. All the participants of the Premier League enter the National Cup competition and enter it at the round of 32 (1/16th of the final) or Round of 16 stage. Also the winner of the League at the beginning of every next season plays against the winner of the National Cup for the Ukrainian Super Cup (under administration of the Premier Liha). Beside Super Cup game and championship among senior teams of the league's clubs, the league also conducts competitions among junior teams including under 21 and under 19. The champion of the under 19 championship qualifies for the UEFA Youth League.\n\nThe old emblem depicts a football that is wrapped around by the blue-yellow stripe (the national colors of Ukraine) on the blue background. Across the top and around the ball there are 16 stars that represent the league's participants (although in 2014 the league was shortened up to 14 teams the emblem was not changed). On the bottom the script says \"Premier-League - Union of Professional Football Clubs of Ukraine\".\n\nAs the old emblem, the new emblem also contains 16 stars. For the 2016-17 season there was added the sponsor's name.\n\nSeason regulations is one of the two most important documents (other being the competition calendar) that are adopted by the Premier League prior to each season.\n\nPremier League directly organizes and conducts competitions among member clubs. Competitions are conducted on principle of \"Fair play\" and according to competitions calendar which is approved by the Premier League General Assembly and the FFU Executive Committee 30 days before start of competitions. Until 2019 all advertisement, commercial rights and rights on TV and radio broadcasting of games of championship and cup belong to the club that hosts them (the Super Cup of Ukraine and the \"Gold game\"). All advertisement, commercial rights and rights on TV and radio broadcasting of the game of Super Cup and the \"Gold game\". Before 2014 Premier League was also administering some rounds of the Ukrainian Cup (Round of 8, Quarterfinals, and Semifinals). The earlier rounds were administered by the Professional League and the final by the Federation. Since 2014 the organization of Ukrainian Cup competitions in full belongs exclusively to the Federation.\n\nThere are currently 12 club members of the league. All participants get approved by the Premier League General Assembly. Each club fields each team for senior competitions, and competitions for under 21 and under 19 teams (three teams). A club is required to have a stadium (registered with FFU) and an education and training facility (or center). A club is also obligated to finance its own youth sports institution and a complex scientific-methodical group as well as to own and finance a number of youth teams. A Premier League club needs to ensure participation of at least four youth teams (ages groups between 14 and 17) in the Youth Football League of Ukraine. A club cannot field more than one team for a certain competition.\n\nAll club's staff members (coaches, physicians, massage specialists) have to be contracted and be UEFA licensed. All coaches should have A-diploma, while head coaches - PRO-diploma. Football players are listed in \"A\" and \"B\" rosters. \"A\" roster contains no more than 25 players, while \"B\" roster has unlimited number of players no older than 21 who have professional contracts or agreements for sports training. The 25-players \"A\" roster includes the number of slots allotted for players developed by the club.\n\nDuring breaks in competitions in summer and winter there are two periods for registering players.\n\nBeside the main championship among senior teams, the Premier League also organizes youth championship which was adopted from the previous Vyshcha Liha championship of doubles (reserves). Since 2012 there was added another competition for junior teams, so the original youth championship was renamed into the Championship of U-21 teams and the new competition was named as the Championship of U-19 teams. Unlike the Championship of U-21 teams, in the Championship of U-19 teams beside all of the Premier League clubs' junior teams, there also compete teams of some lower leagues' clubs.\n\nThe league's championship among senior teams is conducted by manner of the round robin system in two cycles \"fall-spring\" with one game at home and another at opponent's field with each participant. A competition calendar is formed after a draw that is conducted based on the Premier League club rankings. The calendar of the second cycle repeats the first, while hosting teams are switched. There should be no less than two calendar days between official games of a club. All games take place between 12:00 and 22:00 local time. Any game postponement is allowed only in emergencies and on decision of the Premier League Administration (Dyrektsiya). Game forfeitures are controlled by technical win/loss nominations and fines, followed by additional sanctions of the FFU Control-Disciplinary Committee, and possible elimination from the league.\n\nClubs play each other twice (once at home and once away) in the 26-match season. The league begins in mid-July and ends in mid-June. After 13 rounds of fixtures, there is a winter break that lasts for three months (from early December to early March). Thus, the winter break is significantly longer than the interval between seasons. This schedule accounts for climatic conditions and matches that of most European leagues in terms of the beginning and the end of the season.\n\nThe first season of the League in 1992 was an exception, as it lasted only half a year. This was because the last Soviet league season ended in the autumn of 1991, and the Football Federation of Ukraine decided to shift the calendar from “spring-fall” to “fall-spring” football seasons. In the inaugural season, 20 clubs were divided into two 10-team groups. In both groups, each club played each other twice, and the championship was decided by a play-off match between the group winners, in which Tavriya Simferopol surprised the pre-season favorite Dynamo Kyiv.\n\nAfter the first season, in each of the following seasons each team played each other team in the League twice. The number of participating teams fluctuated between 14 and 18, stabilizing since 2002–03 season at 16.\n\nAs of the 2005–06 season, the golden match rule was introduced. According to the rule, if the first two teams obtain the same number of points, the championship is to be decided by an additional \"golden\" match between the two teams. In fact, in that season Dynamo Kyiv and Shakhtar Donetsk had earned the same number of points and Shakhtar won the championship by winning the golden match (2–1 after extra time).\n\nSince the fall of the Soviet Union, the inaugural independent championship took place hastily at the start of spring 1992 after the creation of the Ukrainian Higher League (, Vyshcha Liha). The League was created out of the six teams that took part in the Soviet Top League, two teams from the Soviet First League, and nine out of the eleven Ukrainian teams from the Soviet Second League. The other two of that eleven were placed in the Ukrainian First League as they were to be relegated anyway. The two best teams of the Soviet Second League B of the \"Ukrainian Zone\" were also placed in the Higher League along with the winner of the 1991 Ukrainian Cup which finished ninth in the same group (Soviet Second League B).\n\nThe 20 participants were split into two groups with the winners playing for the championship title and the runners-up playing for third place. Three teams from each group were to be relegated. As expected, the five favorites, \"Dynamo Kyiv\", \"Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk\", \"Shakhtar Donetsk\", \"Chornomorets Odesa\", and \"Metalist Kharkiv\" finished at the top of each group. In the championship play-off game in Lviv, a sensation took place as Tavriya Simferopol beat Dynamo Kyiv 1–0. The Crimeans earned the first Ukrainian title (thus far their only one), losing only once to Temp Shepetivka.\n\nAfter being stunned in the first championship by the \"tragedy\" in Lviv, Dynamo Kyiv were anxious to earn their first title at the second opportunity. In the second Ukrainian championship, which had a regular League format of 16 teams, the main rivals of the Kyivians were Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, who were top after the first half of the season. By the end of the season both teams were neck and neck and at the end they finished with the same number of points. The championship title was awarded to Dynamo Kyiv as they had a better goal difference. Neither the \"Golden match\", nor the fact that Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk had a better head-to-head record was considered.\n\nThe next seven years were known as the total domination of Dynamo Kyiv. During this period 'the main Soviet protagonists' had changed as some of the best teams were facing a crisis. After the 1993–94 season Metalist Kharkiv were surprisingly relegated to the First League. In the 1995–96 season Shakhtar Donetsk had the worst year in the club's history, coming tenth. Chornomorets Odesa were relegated twice during that first decade after which manager Leonid Buryak was sacked. A few newly created teams have since emerged such as Arsenal Kyiv and Metalurh Donetsk, as well as Vorskla Poltava, who surprisingly came third in the club's first season at the Top Level in the 1997.\n\nThe next decade was marked by fierce competition between Dynamo Kyiv and Shakhtar Donetsk. Since 2000, Shakhtar Donetsk has proved to be the real challengers to Kiev's dominance. In 2000 Shakhtar earned their first qualification to the Champions League earning a place in the Group stage. Nonetheless, Dynamo Kyiv is still considered to be the benchmark of excellence in the country and the primary feeder to the Ukrainian national football team. 2002 became the real cornerstone in the \"miners\" history when they earned their first national title under the management of the newly appointed Italian specialist, Nevio Scala, who managed to secure the Ukrainian Cup title as well. Since that time the issue of foreign players has become particularly acute and brought a series of court cases. The FFU and PFL worked together to solve that issue, coming up with a plan to force the \"transitional\" limitation of foreign players over time.\n\nThe clubs such as Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk and Chornomorets Odesa, who were recent contenders for the title, had to put up a fierce fight against the newly established contenders Metalurh Donetsk and Metalist Kharkiv to qualify for the European competitions. Metalist Kharkiv shone brightly in the late 2000s (decade) by consistently finishing right behind Dynamo Kyiv and Shakhtar Donetsk in third place. Their most remarkable feat was their participation in the 2009 European season when they had to face Dynamo Kyiv to earn a place in the quarter-finals of the 2008–09 UEFA Cup, but lost on the away goals rule. That same 2008–09 UEFA Cup competition was won for the first time by Shakhtar Donetsk, the first club of independent Ukraine to win the title. It was also the last UEFA cup title before it changed its name to the Europa league. In the 2008–09 season the league earned the highest UEFA league coefficient in Europe for that season.\nOn 15 November 2007 clubs' presidents of the Vyshcha Liha adopted a decision to create the Premier League (Premier Liha). At the same meeting session there was created a supervisory board that consisted of Ravil Safiullin (Professional Football League), Vitaliy Danilov (FC Kharkiv), Petro Dyminskyi (FC Karpaty), and Vadym Rabinovych (FC Arsenal). During the next three months that body curated a process on creation of the Premier League's regulation and statute as well as a procedure of launching the championship starting from the 2008-09 season. On 15 April 2008 at one of the meetings among the presidents of clubs there was signed a protocol about establishing the Association of Professional Football Clubs of Ukraine \"Premier-Liha\" as an autonomous entity, parting away from the PFL. The Premier League has been split since the moment it was created in regards to its president. The dispute went as far as even canceling the 13th round of 2009–10 season and moving it to the spring half, while having the 14th round still playing in the fall. The representatives of five clubs: Arsenal Kyiv, Dynamo Kyiv, Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, Kryvbas Kryvyi Rih, and Metalist Kharkiv have been boycotting most of the League meetings, not complying with its financial obligations and giving the broadcasting rights to TV-channels other than the League official supplier. They justified their actions due to what they deem to be the illegal election of the Premier League president. The representatives of the above-mentioned clubs did not recognize the election in 2008 of Vitaliy Danilov as the president and believed that the elections should have been won by Vadim Rabinovich.\n\nTo resolve this conflict Vitaliy Danilov instigated the re-election of the Premier League president in September 2009, and on 1 December 2009 won the election again with 11 clubs voting for his candidature, 3 were against, 1 abstained, and 1 was absent. This time most club presidents of the Premier League of Ukraine acknowledged Vitaliy Danilov legality. In the subsequent elections on 9 December 2011 Vitaliy Danilov was challenged by Andriy Kurhanskyi (through the proposal of Karpaty Lviv). The other available candidates, Miletiy Balchos (president of the Professional Football League of Ukraine) and Yuriy Kindzerskyi, were not picked by any members of the Premier League. Vitaliy Danilov managed to retain his seat with nine votes for him.\n\nStarting from 2010 and until 2015, FC Shakhtar led by Romanian coach Mircea Lucescu obtained five national league titles in a row and making Lucescu the most successful coach in the league. In the 2013-14 season FC Dynamo for the first time since Ukrainian independence placed fourth in league's season ranking and led to dismissal of former national team coach and the legend of Soviet football Oleh Blokhin as the club's manager.\nBecause of the Russian aggression against Ukraine and cleaning of the league from the financially unreliable clubs (Metalist, Hoverla, Dnipro), the number of teams participating in the league was cut from 16 in the 2013–14 season to 14 in the following seasons. With the continuation of the military conflict in the eastern oblasts (regions) of Ukraine since 2014, the league was forced to change its format again and will now be contested by 12 teams after being cut from 14 in the 2015–16 season.\n\n\n\n\nThe following teams are competing in the 2019–20 season. Note, in parenthesis shown the actual home cities and stadiums.\nFree-to-air live matches from the Ukrainian Premier League will be broadcast on Saturdays and Sundays on satellite channel 2+2 (Sirius 5E).\nThis is a list of television broadcasters which provide coverage of the Ukrainian Premier League, which is Ukrainian football's top level of competition.\n\nThe main international broadcaster of the league in west Europe and some countries of Africa is the French Ma Chaîne Sport providing coverage for such countries like France, and satellite communities in Andorra, Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Monaco, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia. Another broadcaster Sport Klub provides coverage in all countries of former Yugoslavia including Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia, and Slovenia. National broadcasters of some other counties include 12 TV (Armenia), CBC Sport (Azerbaijan), Polsat Futbol (Poland), Futbol (Russia), and Dolce Sport (Romania).\n\nUkrainian clubs being part of the Soviet Union competed in European competitions since 1960s when the Soviet clubs started to participate in continental competitions. In fact the very first Soviet club that took part in European competitions was Ukrainian club, FC Dynamo Kyiv, that took in the 1965–66 European Cup Winners' Cup. Before the fall of the Soviet Union, the following Ukrainian clubs participated in European competitions: FC Dynamo Kyiv (1965), FC Karpaty Lviv (1970), FC Zorya Luhansk (1973), FC Chornomorets Odessa (1975), FC Shakhtar Donetsk (1977), FC Dnipro (1984), and FC Metalist Kharkiv (1988).\n\nAt least five clubs participated in top continental competitions the European Cup and the UEFA Champions League among which are FC Dynamo Kyiv, FC Dnipro, FC Metalist Kharkiv, FC Shakhtar Donetsk, and SC Tavriya Simferopol.\n\nTwo teams (Dynamo and Shakhtar) were able to obtain trophies of European competitions including two Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Supercup, and one UEFA Cup. One more team (Dnipro) came just short to join their company losing in the 2015 UEFA Europa League Final.\n\nUEFA Club Ranking\n\n\"Note\": Since 1999 the country index (coefficient) indicates the lowest possible value any team of that country will get in the ranking. Currently it's 6.866 for Ukraine. Teams ranked below their country's ranking are positioned by the ranking of their country rather its own. Teams in bold will be participating in the 2017–18 European football season. \n\nUEFA Country Ranking \n\nIn 2009 The Ukrainian Premier League joined the European Professional Football Leagues. Also in 2009 the league signed a partnership with IMG of which during the first month of cooperation sold broadcasting rights for the Ukrainian Cup to Poland and Armenia. On its own initiative the Ukrainian Premier League sold broadcasting rights to Romania and Russia as well.\n\n</div>\nNotes: \n\n\nA representative star is placed above the team's badge to indicate 10 league titles. Dynamo Kyiv became the first Ukrainian team to achieve the prestigious honor of winning the Soviet Top League for the 10th time in 1981. Dynamo Kyiv after having entered the Ukrainian championship has become the same dominant leader as during the Soviet times by earning its 20th national title at the top level in 1999. The two stars, however, were only added to the club's logo in 2007. Earning its 10th national title in 2017, Shakhtar Donetsk has not yet adopted a star on its crest.\n\nCurrently (as of 2018) the following clubs earned the star element to be added to their crest.\n\nEx-Dynamo Kyiv strikers Maksim Shatskikh and Serhiy Rebrov hold the record for most Ukrainian Premier League goals with 123, with Shatskikh winning the top single season scorer title twice in 1999–2000 and 2002–03, Rebrov once in 1997-98.\nSince the first Ukrainian Premier League season in 1992, 22 different players have won or shared the top scorer's title. \nOnly four players have won the title more than once, Tymerlan Huseynov, Maksim Shatskikh, Yevhen Seleznyov and Alex Teixeira. \nHenrikh Mkhitaryan holds the record for most goals in a season (25), Serhiy Rebrov and Maksim Shatskikh are the only two players to score at least 20 goals twice. The most prolific all-time scorers are Ivan Hetsko and Viktor Leonenko, respectively attaining 0.59 and 0.56 goals per game.\n\nThe league's record holder for winnings is Mircea Lucescu.\n\nThe league's record holder for games that the coach led a team in the league is Myron Markevych. Among other coaches who stayed in the league the longest, there are Nikolay Kostov (139), Vasyl Sachko (137), Oleksandr Zavarov (134), Oleksandr Babych (130), Roman Pokora (129), Oleksandr Sevidov (129), Roman Sanzhar (125), Ivan Balan (123), Roman Hryhorchuk (119), and Yuriy Maksymov (116).\n\nThe table lists the place each team took in each of the seasons.\n\nTeams marking:\nAll figures are correct through the 2018–19 season. Promotion/relegation playoff games are not included.Teams in bold currently compete in Premier League. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe central feature of the league is a rivalry between Shakhtar Donetsk and Dynamo Kyiv which has adopted its name as Klasychne derby. The rivalry started ever since the end of 1990s when both teams started consistently to place the top two places from season to season. The rivalry became really established when Shakhtar obtained its first national title in 2002.\n\nThe surprising win of the first season by SC Tavriya Simferopol has never turned the club into a real contender for another title and the club was not always successful to secure a place among the top five. In the beginning of 1990s, FC Chornomorets Odessa and the two-time Soviet champions FC Dnipro were also among the main contenders. The 1972 Soviet champions FC Zorya Luhansk until 2013 really struggled to stay in the top league. Among other contenders there were FC Metalist Kharkiv that were the league's runners-up in 2012–13 and FC Metalurh Donetsk that showed some consistent form in the early 2000s.\n\nThere are few smaller regional rivalries such between Karpaty and Volyn, Metalist and Dnipro, Zorya and Shakhtar.\n\nAmong city derbies, there were no running city derbies in the league for the 2017–18 season. Among the most notable previously there were Zaporizhia derby between Metalurh and Torpedo, Kyiv derby between Dynamo and Arsenal (CSKA), Donetsk derby between Shakhtar and Metalurh. Other derbies existed in Lviv, Odesa, Kharkiv, West Ukrainian football derby and others.\n\nUkraine has several big stadiums with capacity of 30,000+ spectators and at least two stadiums with capacity of over 50,000 which also are considered to be by UEFA the elite stadiums. Since the 2014 Ukrainian civil war, the access to some stadiums was restricted. Many stadiums in Ukraine and their surrounding infrastructure were renovated in preparation to the Euro 2012.\n\nAmong 30,000+ football stadiums or multi-use stadiums adopted for football are Arena Lviv, Chornomorets Stadium, Dnipro Arena, Metalist Stadium and others.\n\nSource:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2322181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322181", "title": "Postosuchus", "text": "Postosuchus\n\nPostosuchus, meaning \"Crocodile from Post\", is an extinct genus of rauisuchid reptiles comprising two species, \"P. kirkpatricki\" and \"P. alisonae\", that lived in what is now North America during the Late Triassic. \"Postosuchus\" is a member of the clade Pseudosuchia, the lineage of archosaurs that includes modern crocodilians (the other main group of archosaurs is Avemetatarsalia, the lineage that includes non-avian dinosaurs and their descendants, birds). Its name refers to Post Quarry, a place in Texas where many fossils of the type species, \"P. kirkpatricki\", were found. It was one of the apex predators of its area during the Triassic, larger than the small dinosaur predators of its time (such as \"Coelophysis\"). It was a hunter which probably preyed on dicynodonts and many other creatures smaller than itself.\n\nThe skeleton of \"Postosuchus\" is large and robust with a deep skull and a long tail. The total body length is about . The extreme shortness of the forelimbs relative to the hind limbs, the very small hands, and measurements of the vertebrae suggest that \"Postosuchus\" may have been committed to bipedal locomotion.\n\n\"Postosuchus\" was one of the largest carnivorous reptiles during the late Triassic. Adults reached around in height, in length from snout to tail tip and their mass might have ranged from . It had a massively built skull bearing dagger-like teeth. The neck was elongated, expanding to a short torso and long tail. Along with remains of the skeleton, paleontologists also identify osteoderms, which were thick plates forming scales. These were on its back, neck, and possibly above or under the tail.\n\nThe neck of \"Postosuchus\" consists of at least eight cervical vertebrae followed by sixteen dorsals, while four co-ossified sacral vertebrae supported the hips. It is thought to be over thirty vertebrae in the tail decreasing in size to the end. The pelvis with the hooked pubis and the rod-like ischium looked like those of carnosaur dinosaurs. The ribcage of \"Postosuchus\" had typical archosaur structure, composed of large and slender, curved ribs. In some discoveries ribs were found associated with gastralia, dermal bones located in the ventral region of the body.\n\nThe skull of \"Postosuchus\" was constructed narrow in front and extended wide and deep behind. It was 55 cm in length and 21 cm broad and deep. There are many fenestrae (openings) present in the bones that lighten the skull, providing space for the muscles. Like more derived archosaurs, the lower jaw had mandibular fenestrae (openings at the lower jaw), formed by the junction of the dentary with other jaw bones (surangular and angular). \"Postosuchus\" had very good long distant sight, due to large orbits, supporting large and sharp eyes, and strong olfaction provided by elongated nostrils. Inside the skull, under the nostrils, there was a hollow that may have contained the Jacobson's organ, an olfactory sensory organ sometimes referred as the \"sixth sense\". The jaws held large and sharp serrated teeth, of which some were developed even larger to operate as hooked sabers. A complete tooth found among \"Postosuchus\" remains in North Carolina measured about 7.2 cm in height. \"Postosuchus\" possessed heterodonty dentition, which means each tooth was different in size and shape from the others. The upper jaw contained seventeen teeth, with each premaxilla bearing only four teeth and each maxilla thirteen teeth. In the lower jaw were over thirty teeth. Replacement activity in \"Postosuchus\" was different from that of crocodiles, since the replacement tooth didn't fit directly in the pulp cavity of the old tooth, but grew until resorption of the old tooth was complete.\n\nWith the forelimbs being approximately 64% of the hindlimbs, \"Postosuchus\" had small hands bearing five toes. Only the first toe bore a large claw, which was used as an offensive weapon, and the forelimbs were robust, probably to hold the prey. The feet were much larger than the hands, with the fifth metatarsal forming a hook shape. The halluxes were slenderer than the other toes and the marginal ones could not touch the ground. Being a crurotarsan, the heel and ankle of \"Postosuchus\" resemble those of modern crocodiles.\nThe limbs were located underneath the body giving \"Postosuchus\" an upright stance. Historically, there has been debate over whether or not rauisuchids like \"Postosuchus\" were mainly bipedal or quadrupedal. Each one of \"Postosuchus\"'s two forelimbs was slightly over half the size of the hindlimbs. This characteristic of short forelimbs can usually be seen in bipedal reptiles. Chatterjee suggested that \"Postosuchus\" could walk in an erect stance, since the short forelimbs were probably used only during slow locomotion. In 1995 Robert Long and Phillip A. Murry argued that \"Postosuchus\" was heavily built and quadrupedal. Peyer et al. 2008, argued that the thick pectoral girdle served for locomotion of the forelimbs. They noted that this does not, however, detract from the theory that \"Postosuchus\" could also walk bipedally. In 2013, a major study of the skeletal structure concluded that \"Postosuchus\" may have been an obligate biped based on evidence from the anatomy of the digits, vertebrae, and pelvis. The proportions of the limbs and weight-bearing sections of the spine were very similar to many theropod dinosaurs, nearly all of which are thought to have been strictly bipedal.\n\nDuring an expedition in 1980, paleontologists of the Texas Tech University discovered a new geological site rich in fossils near Post, Garza County, Texas, US, where a dozen well-preserved specimens belonging to a new rauisuchid were found. In the following years further excavation in the Post Quarry, in Cooper Canyon Formation (Dockum Group), unearthed many remains of late Triassic terrestrial fauna. The holotype of \"P. kirkpatricki\" (TTUP 9000), representing a well-preserved skull and a partial postcranial skeleton, was described along with other findings of this new genus by paleontologist Sankar Chatterjee in 1985. A paratype, TTU-P 9002, representing a well-preserved skull and a complete skeleton was also assigned to this species. Chatterjee named the species after Mr. and Mrs. Jack Kirkpatrick who helped during his fieldwork. Subsequently, some specimens (such manus and toe bones) were re-assigned to \"Chatterjeea\" and \"Lythrosuchus\"; Long and Murry pointed out that many of the juvenile skeletons (TTUP 9003-9011), which Chatterjee assigned to \"P. kirkpatricki\", belong to a distinct genus, named \"Chatterjeea elegans\". Furthermore, in 2006 Nesbitt and Norell argued that \"Chatterjeea\" is a junior synonym of \"Shuvosaurus\".\n\nIn 2008, Peyer \"et al.\", described a new species of \"Postosuchus\", \"P. alisonae\" that was discovered in 1992 in Triangle Brick Co. Quarry, Durham County, North Carolina. The remains were prepared and reconstructed between 1994 and 1998 by the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of North Carolina. The specific name is in reference to Alison L. Chambers, who worked to popularize paleontology in North Carolina. The skeleton of \"P. alisonae\" consists of a few cranial bones, seven neck, one back, and four tail vertebrae, ribs, gastralia (\"belly ribs\"), chevrons, bony scutes, much of the shoulder girdles, most of the forelimbs except the left wrist and hand, most of the hindlimbs except for the thigh bones, and pieces from the hip. Moreover, the well-preserved remains of \"P. alisonae\" shed new light on parts of \"Postosuchus\" anatomy, which were previously not well known. Specifically, the differences between the manus bones of \"P. kirkpatricki\" and \"P. alisonae\" confirm the chimera theory (associated fossils belonging to different animals) suggested by Long and Murry. The holotype specimen of \"P. alisonae\" (UNC 15575) is also unusual in its preservation of gut contents: bones from at least four other animals, including a partial skeleton of an aetosaur, a snout, coracoid, and humerus of the traversodontid cynodont \"Plinthogomphodon\", two phalanges from a dicynodont, and a possible temnospondyl bone. Furthermore, the \"Postosuchus\" was positioned on top of a skeleton of the sphenosuchian \"Dromicosuchus\", which included tooth marks on the skull and neck. \"P. alisonae\" represents the largest suchian reptile recovered from the quarry and the first articulated specimen of 'rauisuchian' archosaur found in eastern North America.\n\nSpecimens similar to \"Postosuchus\" were discovered in Crosby County, Texas in 1920, and described by paleontologist Ermine Cowles Case in 1922. The fossils were composed only of an isolated braincase (UM 7473) and fragments of pelvic bones (UM 7244). Case then mistakenly assigned these specimens to the dinosaur genus \"Coelophysis\". In the case of the braincase later assigned to \"Postosuchus\", in 2002 paleontologist David J. Gower argued that the specimen is not complete and may belong to an ornithodire. Between 1932 and 1934, Case discovered other fossils of caudal vertebrae (UMMP 13670) in Rotten Hill, Texas, and a complete pelvis (UCMP V72183/113314) near Kalgary, Texas. Within the same period, paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp collected over a hundred \"rauisuchian\" bones, from what is now the Petrified Forest National Park of Arizona, which belong to at least seven individuals (UCMP A296, MNA 207C). Later, more remains came to light. In 1943, Case again described a pelvis along with a pubis (UM 23127) from the Dockum Group of Texas, which dates from the Carnian through the early Norian stages of Late Triassic period. These early findings, from 1932 to 1943, were initially referred to as a new phytosaur reptile, but assigned forty years later to \"Postosuchus\".\n\nThe first articulated skeleton referred to \"P. kirkpatricki\" (CM 73372) was recovered by David S. Berman of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, in Coelophysis Quarry at Ghost Ranch, New Mexico, between 1988 and 1989. This specimen was composed of a well-preserved skeleton without skull and was described by Long and Murry in 1995, Weinbaum in 2002 and Novak in 2004. The specimen represents a skeletally immature individual because none of the neural sutures are closed. It was referred to \"P. kirkpatricki\" by Long and Murry (1995) without specific justification, and more recent studies accepted this referral. Nevertheless, Nesbitt (2011) noted that these studies failed to note any synapomorphies unique to \"P. kirkpatricki\" and CM 73372. Weinbaum (2002) and Novak (2004) even noted that the preacetabular process of the ilium in CM 73372 was much longer than that of \"P. kirkpatricki\". Nesbitt (2011) also noted that CM 73372 differs from \"P. kirkpatricki\" and \"Rauisuchus\" in possessing a concave ventral margin of the ilium, and from \"P. alisonae\" in processing an asymmetrical distal end of the fourth metatarsal. Nesbitt (2011) couldn't differentiate CM 73372 and \"Polonosuchus\" as they overlap only in the caudal vertebrae. A phylogenetic analysis conducted by Nesbitt (2011), one of the most extensive on archosaurs, found CM 73372 to be the most basal crocodylomorph, thus referable neither to \"P. kirkpatricki\" nor to Rauisuchidae.\n\nIn their description of \"Vivaron\", Lessner \"et al.\" (2016) questioned the random referral of all rauisuchid material from the southwestern US to \"Postosuchus\", saying that the discovery of \"Vivaron\" stresses the need for a re-appraisal of all material from localities younger or older than unequivocal remains of \"Postosuchus\" and \"Vivaron\".\n\n\"Postosuchus\" lived in a tropical environment. The moist and warm region consisted of ferns, such as \"Cynepteris\", \"Phelopteris\" and \"Clathropteris\", gymnosperms, represented by \"Pelourdea\", \"Araucarioxylon\", \"Woodworthia\", \"Otozamites\" and \"Dinophyton\", and cycads like \"Sanmiguelia\". Plants of the Dockum Group are not well known since the oxidizing of the environment has destroyed most of the plant fossils. Some of them may, however, provide information about the climate in Dockum Group during the late Triassic period. For example, the discovery of large specimens belonging to \"Araucarioxylon\" determine that the region was well watered. The fauna found in Dockum Group confirm that there were lakes and/or rivers containing fish such as the cartilaginous \"Xenacanthus\", the lobe-finned \"Chinlea\" and the dipnoan \"Ceratodus\". On the shores of these rivers lived labyrinthodonts (\"Latiscopus\") and reptiles such as \"Malerisaurus\" and \"Trilophosaurus\". Also living on the margins of the lakes were the archosaurs \"Leptosuchus\", \"Nicrosaurus\" and \"Rutiodon\". \"Postosuchus\" lived in the uplands along with \"Coelophysis\" and other archosaurs such as \"Desmatosuchus\" and \"Typothorax\". \"Postosuchus\" was one of the largest animals in that ecosystem and preyed on herbivores such as \"Trilophosaurus\" and \"Typothorax\".\n\n\n"}

In certain changchuan styles, this kick is known as Swallow Kick (Yianzi tui).\n\nAlthough the specific nature of the kick varies, it is generally composed of a twist of the body while both legs are lifted from the ground and swung around, while the torso remains as horizontal as possible.\nIn action cinema it is often seen as a kick used to \"cut a swathe\" through multiple opponents.\nIn traditional Chinese longfist, it is used defensively to evade an opponent's floor sweep and land on the enemy's vulnerable side.\nThere are many variations, and different movements may be captured under the same name or likewise similar movements given under a different name depending on the martial arts school or style. It can be executed either from standing or from a step up run.\n\nThe name \"butterfly kick\" is due to the legs reaching the apex of their arc the arms are stretched out, leaving all limbs extended in a position similar to that of a butterfly's wings in-flight.\n\nThere are many butterfly kick variants, as each student adopts slightly different maneuvers and style depending on his specific martial arts background. For example, a wushu-derived butterfly kick would be somewhat more graceful compared to a tae kwon do-derived kick, which would have a more dynamic, energetic look.\n\n\nSome variants add additional rotation(s) to the standard Butterfly twist. The extra twisting generally requires faster twisting of the body, more torque and extra height in order to land safely.\n\nThe spectacular appearance that is both graceful and powerful as from its martial arts origin has made the Butterfly kick versatile in a wide range of performing arts such as breakdancing, tricking, martial arts films, various video games (such as the Tekken series, the Mortal Kombat series and The Matrix Online), gymnastics and even on the ice as seen in Olympics figure skating. It has also appeared in the sport of professional wrestling by trained martial artists like Low Ki. It also appeared in \"\" as one of Darth Maul's signature techniques, Ray Park being a wushu champion. Though not as well known as some of the other tricking moves such as aerials and flips, the Butterfly kick holds a unique position in the acrobatic world for being a traditional defensive move incorporated into the modern popular arts and international sports.\n\n\n"}

He was working as a surgeon in Orléans before entering the novitiate of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) in Paris on 16 March 1639. He had to leave the novitiate due to deafness.\n\nGoupil volunteered to serve as a lay missionary working to assist the Jesuit Fathers. In 1640 he arrived in New France. From 1640 to 1642 he served at the Saint-Joseph de Sillery Mission, near Quebec, where he was charged with caring for the sick and wounded at the hospital. His work primarily involved wound dressings and bloodlettings.\n\nIn 1642 Goupil travelled to the Huron missions with about forty other persons, including several Huron chiefs and Jesuit Father Isaac Jogues. They were captured by the Mohawk, taken to their easternmost village of Ossernenon (about 9 miles west of present-day Auriesville, New York), and tortured. After teaching a Mohawk boy the sign of the cross, Goupil was killed on the Feast of St. Michael the Archangel, 29 September 1642, by a blow to the head with a tomahawk. He died uttering the Holy Name of Jesus, as he had practiced in case of martyrdom. Fr. Jogues was present and gave Goupil absolution before expiring. Before being martyred, Goupil had professed religious vows as a Jesuit lay brother before Fr. Jogues. Many of the 24 Huron accompanying Goupil were baptized Catholic converts. Traditional enemies of the Mohawk, they were slowly tortured in accordance with Iroquois ritual before being killed.\n\nGoupil is venerated as the first Jesuit martyr of Canada and one of three martyrs of the territory of the present United States. He was canonized on 29 June 1930 by Pope Pius XI along with the seven other Canadian Martyrs or \"North American Martyrs\".

It aims to include sizable Protestant communions, federations, alliances, councils, fellowships, and other denominational organisations in the world and provides information regarding the membership thereof. The list is inevitably partial and generally based on claims by the denominations themselves. The numbers should therefore be considered approximate and the article an ongoing work-in-progress. Protestant bodies being considered in this article are divided into:\n\n\nIn 2010, the most numerous international bodies accounted for more than a half of worldwide Protestant population, while the most numerous national bodies accounted for more than 200 of the world's 800 million Protestants.\n\nTransdenominational organisations are very large and often characterized by overlapping membership as opposed to international and national bodies. Some of the national groupings cannot be considered churches in mainstream Protestant ecclesiology even when they constitute a single denomination. A good example is the Evangelical Church in Germany, which differs denominationally and encompasses Lutheran, Reformed and United subchurches.\n\nTransdenominational bodies include people across all denominations that participate in a movement which goes beyond their Protestant branch, like Evangelicalism, the Charismatic movement, or the Neo-charismatic movement. These are of international scope.\n\nThe World Evangelical Alliance is so far the only major transdenominational evangelical Protestant organization that operates internationally. It represents 600 million Christians. The Porvoo Communion brings Lutherans and Anglicans in Europe under a common communion.\n\nInternational bodies tend to bring together only one Protestant branch which shares common founders, tenets and history. Among the most sizeable international bodies are the Anglican Communion, the World Communion of Reformed Churches, the World Methodist Council and the Lutheran World Federation – each with more than 70 million members.\n\nAlthough there are \"\"mostly national\" denominations\" like the United Methodist Church (mainly concentrated in the United States), or \"denominations with dispersed membership\" like the Apostolic Church and the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee) (both with membership dispersed around the world) that have a far larger membership than required to be on this list, they operate worldwide and cannot be considered alongside other national bodies like, for example, the Church of Christ in Congo, which operates solely in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is not active beyond that country's borders.\n\nThe Church of England, the Church of Christ in Congo, the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, the Assembleias de Deus and the Evangelical Church in Germany constitute the most numerous national bodies with more than 20 million members each.\n\nThese denominations operate worldwide and cannot be considered alongside other national bodies.\n\nMany sizeable non-national bodies happen to be Pentecostal. The list also includes the largest Adventist church (the Seventh-day Adventist Church), the largest Methodist church (the United Methodist Church) and the largest African initiated church (the Zion Christian Church) and the second largest Pentecostal denomination in the world, The Pentecostal Mission (TPM) or (New Testament Church/Universal Pentecostal Church/Ceylon Pentecostal Mission).\n\n"}

When mustard oil is adulterated deliberately (as in most cases) or accidentally with argemone oil, proteinuria (specifically loss of albumin) occurs, with a resultant edema as would occur in nephrotic syndrome.\n\nOther major symptoms are bilateral pitting edema of extremities, headache, nausea, loose bowels, erythema, glaucoma and breathlessness.\n\nLeakage of the protein-rich plasma component into the extracellular compartment leads to the formation of edema. The haemodynamic consequences of this vascular dilatation and permeability lead to a state of relative hypovolemia with a constant stimulus for fluid and salt conservation by the kidneys. Illness begins with gastroenteric symptoms followed by cutaneous erythema and pigmentation. Respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath and orthopnoea, progressing to frank right-sided congestive cardiac failure, are seen.\n\nMild to moderate anaemia, hypoproteinaemia, mild to moderate renal azotemia, retinal haemorrhages, and glaucoma are common manifestations. There is no specific therapy. Removal of the adulterated oil and symptomatic treatment of congestive cardiac failure and respiratory symptoms, along with administration of antioxidants and multivitamins, remain the mainstay of treatment.\n\nEpidemic dropsy occurs as an epidemic in places where use of mustard oil from the seeds of \"Brassica\" \"juncea\", commonly known as Indian mustard, as a cooking medium is common.\n\n\"Argemone mexicana\" (family Papaveraceae), a native of West Indies and naturalized in India, is known as “Shailkanta” in Bengal and “Bharbhanda” in Uttar Pradesh. It is also popularly known as “Pivladhatura” or “Satyanashi”, meaning devastating. The plant grows wildly in mustard and other fields. Its seeds are black in colour and are similar to the dark coloured mustards seeds (\"Brassica juncea\") in shape and size. Adulteration of argemone seeds in light yellow colored mustard seeds (\"Brassica compestris\") can easily be detected, but these seeds are rather difficult to visualize when mixed with dark coloured mustard seeds.\n\nArgemone seeds yield approximately 35% oil. Alkaloid content in argemone oil varies from 0.44% to 0.50%. Argemone seeds find use as a substitute because of the easy availability, low cost and their complete miscibility of their oil with mustard oil.\n\nMortality is usually due to heart failure, pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome or renal failure and is around 5%. Long-term follow-up studies are scanty so the long-term effects of argemone oil toxicity have not been documented. It has been reported that 25% of cases will have oedema beyond 2 months and 10% beyond 5 months. Pigmentation of skin and excessive loss of hair, which lasted 4–5 months following the disease. The majority of patients completely recover in about 3 months.\n\nROS and Oxidative stress : Studies in the blood of dropsy patients has revealed that there is extensive ROS production (singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide) in the argemone oil intoxication leading to depletion of total antioxidants in the body and especially lipid-soluble antioxidants such as vitamin E and A (tocopherol and retinol). There is an extensive damage to the anti-oxidant defense system (anti-oxidant enzymes and anti-oxidants) of blood. Prior, in vitro studies have shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in AO induced toxicity causing peroxidative damage of lipids in various hepatic sub-cellular fractions including microsomes and mitochondria of rats. The damage in hepatic microsomal membrane causes loss of activity of cytochrome P-450 and other membrane bound enzymes responsible for xenobiotic metabolism which leads to delayed bioelimination of sanguinarine and enhances its cumulative toxicity. Several lines of evidence have been shown to explain the mechanism of toxicity of argemone oil/alkaloid. The toxicity of sanguinarine has been shown to be dependent on the reactivity of its iminium bond with nucleophilic sites like thiol groups, present at the active sites of the enzymes and other vital proteins and thus suggesting the electrophilic nature of the alkaloid.\n\nPulmonary Toxicity: The decrease in glycogen levels following argemone oil intoxication could be due to enhanced glycogenolysis leading to the formation of glucose-1-phosphate, which enters the glycoltic pathway resulting in accumulation of pyruvate in the blood of experimental animals and dropsy patients. The enhancement of glycogenolysis can further be supported by the interference of sanguinarine in the uptake of glucose through blocking of sodium pump via Na-K-ATPase and thereby inhibiting the active transport of glucose across intestinal barrier. It is well established that increased pyruvate concentration in blood uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, and this may be responsible for thickening of interalveolar septa and disorganized alveolar spaces in lungs of argemone oil-fed rats and the breathlessness as has been observed in human victims.\nCardiac Failure:The inhibition of Na-K-ATPase activity of heart by sanguinarine is due to interaction with the cardiac glycoside receptor site of the enzyme, which may be responsible for producing degenerative changes in cardiac muscle fibers in the auricular wall of rats fed argemone oil and could be related to tachycardia and cardiac failure in Epidemic Dropsy patients.\n\nDelayed clearance:Destruction of hepatic cytochrome P450 significantly affects the metabolic clearance by liver. The retention of sanguinarine in the GI tract, liver, lung, kidney, heart, and serum even after 96 hrs of exposure indicates these as the likely target sites of argemone oil toxicity.\n\nNitric acid test and paper chromatography test are used in the detection of argemone oil.Paper chromatography test is the most sensitive test.\n\nWithdrawal of the contaminated cooking oil is the most important initial step. Bed rest with leg elevation and a protein-rich diet are useful. Supplements of calcium, antioxidants (vitamin C and E), and thiamine and other B vitamins are commonly used. Corticosteroids and antihistaminics such as promethazine have been advocated by some investigators, but demonstrated efficacy is lacking. Diuretics are used universally but caution must be exercised not to deplete the intravascular volume unless features of frank congestive cardiac failure are present, as oedema is mainly due to increased capillary permeability. Cardiac failure is managed by bed rest, salt restriction, digitalis and diuretics. Pneumonia is treated with appropriate antibiotics. Renal failure may need dialysis therapy and complete clinical recovery is seen. Glaucoma may need operative intervention, but generally responds to medical management.\n\nBesides India, widespread epidemics have been reported from Mauritius, Fiji Islands, Northwest Cape districts of South Africa, Madagascar and also from Nepal. Apart from a South African study, where the epidemic occurred through contamination in wheat flour, all the epidemics occurred through the consumption of mustard oil contaminated with argemone oil.\n\nIn these populations mustard oil is the prime edible oil by culture.\n\nThe earliest reference to argemone oil poisoning was made by Lyon, who reported four cases of poisoning in Calcutta in 1877 from the use of this oil in food.\n\nSince then, epidemic dropsy has been reported from Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Assam, J&K, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Delhi and Maharashtra, mainly due to consumption of food cooked in argemone oil mixed with mustard oil or occasionally by body massage with contaminated oil.\n\nThe epidemic in 1998 at New Delhi, India is the largest so far, in which over 60 persons lost their lives and more than 3000 victims were hospitalized. Few studies reported the findings in patients affected with this condition.\n\nEven after that the epidemics occurred at alarming frequency in Gwalior (2000), Kannauj (2002) and Lucknow (2005) cities of India.\n"}

The two manuscripts both include \"Piers Plowman\", and in the first, the \"Crede\" serves as an introduction to a C-text version of \"Piers Plowman\". Additionally, BL MS Harley 78 contains a fragment of the \"Crede\" copied c. 1460–70.\n\nThe \"Crede\" was first printed in London by Reyner Wolfe, and then reprinted for inclusion with Owen Rogers's 1561 reprint of Robert Crowley's 1550 edition of \"Piers Plowman\". The \"Crede\" was not printed again until Thomas Bensley's edition in 1814, based on that of 1553, and Thomas Wright's of 1832. The 1553 and 1561 editions were altered to include more anticlericalism and to attack an \"abbot\" where the original text had \"bishop\". This latter revision is a conservative one, undoubtedly motivated by the security of attacking a defunct institution following the Dissolution of the Monasteries rather than an aspect of Catholicism which survived in the Church of England. Nearly all modern critics have agreed that several lines about transubstantiation were removed. This excision was covered with a (perhaps interpolated) passage not found in any of the manuscripts.\n\nThe poem exists in several modern editions: Thomas Wright and Walter Skeat produced independent versions in the 19th century; more recently, James Dean has edited the text for TEAMs, and Helen Barr has produced an annotated edition in \"The Piers Plowman Tradition\" (London: J.M. Dent, 1993) ().\n\nSome scholars believe it is very likely that the author of the \"Crede\" may also be responsible for the anti-fraternal \"Plowman's Tale\", also known as the \"Complaint of the Ploughman\". Both texts were probably composed at about the same time, with \"The Plowman's Tale\" being the later and drawing extensively on the \"Crede\". The author/speaker of \"The Plowman's Tale\" mentions that he will not deal with friars, since he has already dealt with them \"before, / In a makynge of a 'Crede'...\" W. W. Skeat believed that \"The Plowman's Tale\" and the \"Crede\" were definitely by the same person, although they differ in style. Others reject this thesis, suggesting that the author of \"The Plowman's Tale\" makes the extra-textual reference to a creed to enhance his own authority.\n\nIn the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the \"Crede\" was usually attributed to Chaucer. The editor of the 1606 edition of \"The Plowman's Tale\", possibly Anthony Wotton, explains his speculations with this gloss: \"A Creede: Some thinke hee means the questions of Jack-vpland, or perhaps Pierce Ploughmans Creede. For Chaucer speakes this in the person of the Pellican, not in his owne person.\" This statement is ambivalent, suggesting that Chaucer could fictionally (\"in the person of the Pellican\") claim authorship for another text that he may not have actually written (i.e., the \"Crede\"), or Chaucer might be referring to one of his own writings (i.e., \"Jack Upland\"). Since \"Jack Upland\" was definitely (and wrongly) attributed to Chaucer in the 16th century, it is likely that the editor is introducing the possibility of a fictive authorship claim to deal with the possibility that \"The Plowman's Tale\" refers to the \"Crede\". In this way the editor may have thought that if \"Jack Upland\" is signified by the \"crede\" reference in \"The Plowman's Tale\", then \"Chaucer\" is speaking; if the \"Crede\" is signified, then it is the \"Pellican, not [Chaucer's] own person.\"\n\nThe \"Crede\" might also have been attributed to \"Robert Langland\" (i.e., William Langland) because of its inclusion in the 1561 edition of \"Piers Plowman\", although this edition dropped the preface by Robert Crowley that names Langland. One reader of the 1561 \"Piers Plowman\" (which appends the \"Crede\") made notes (dated 1577) in his copy that quote John Bale's attribution of \"Piers Plowman\" to Langland (\"ex primis J. Wiclevi discipulis unum\") in Bale's \"Index...Scriptorum\". Because of differences in language and his belief that Chaucer lived later than Langland, the reader concludes that the \"Crede\" alone (and not \"Piers Plowman\") is Chaucer's.\n\nLike much political or religious poetry of the Alliterative Revival (i.e., \"Piers Plowman\", \"Mum and the Sothsegger\"), the poem takes the form of a quest for knowledge. It is narrated by a layman who has memorised nearly all of the rudimentary texts demanded by the Fourth Lateran Council. He can read, and is able to recite the Ave Maria and Pater Noster proficiently: yet he does not know the Creed. He seeks help from the friars, first turning to the Franciscans, then the Dominicans, followed by the Austin friars and the Carmelites. But rather than learning anything of value, all he hears are imprecations. Each order savagely attacks one of its rival groups of mendicants: the Franciscans denounce the Carmelites; the Carmelites denounce the Dominicans; the Dominicans denounce the Augustines; the Augustines complete this carousel of invective by denouncing the Franciscans. The entire poem seems like an uproarious inversion of cantos xi and xii of Dante's \"Paradiso\": just as Dante has the Dominican Aquinas and the Franciscan Bonaventure lauding one another's orders, so the \"Crede\"-poet makes the mendicants exchange abuse.\n\nBut all is not entirely lost. As he returns home, the narrator encounters a poor Plowman, dressed in rags and so emaciated that \"men myyte reken ich a ryb\" (432). Although starving, the Plowman freely offers the narrator what food he does have. When the narrator tells him of his experiences with the friars, the Plowman launches into a blistering diatribe on the four orders. Recognising the wisdom of the Plowman's words, the narrator asks him whether he can teach him the Creed. He is glad to do so: the poem ends with the Plowman's recital of the elusive text.\n\nTwo features make the \"Crede\" particularly worthy of note. Firstly, it is the earliest text to imitate William Langland's \"Piers Plowman\", to which it refers explicitly. The selfless Plowman is of course directly drawn from the earlier work. Perhaps written within eight years of the C-text of \"Piers Plowman\", the \"Crede\" thus testifies to the appeal of Langland's more subversive, anticlerical sentiments among some of his early readers. Of course, the \"Crede\"-poet only uses \"Piers Plowman\" as a launch-pad for his own views. The \"Crede\" is markedly more confident than Langland in its opposition to the clergy. The fact that it abandons Langland's dream-vision framework is suggestive of this, as if the lay perfection that the Plowman represents has become more achievable in reality. \"The Crede\" conflates Piers (here, \"Peres\") with the author/dreamer of \"Piers Plowman\", thus collapsing that poem's many voices into a single, collective voice of the ideal community. This misprision was a common aspect of Piers Plowman's dissemination. The character of Piers thus escapes from the confines of William Langland's vision and takes on a life, an authority, and an authorial career of his own. As in \"The Plowman's Tale\" and \"The Prayer and Complaint of the Plowman\", true religion is the virtue of the poor. The Piers of the \"Crede\" is simply a plowman without the Christological aspect of Piers in Langland's poem.\n\nA second, related point of interest is that the \"Crede\" is a Lollard production that acknowledges the influence of Walter Map's Latin, anti-monastic \"Goliardic\" satires, such as \"The Apocalypse of Bishop Golias\" and \"The Confession of Golias.\" The author of the \"Crede\" claims that these works tarnished the monastic orders and brought on the mendicant orders, or else Satan himself founded them. With clear Lollard sympathies, the \"Crede\" praises John Wycliffe and as well as Walter Brut who is mentioned in relation to his heresy trial. (There were several trials for Brut, a Welsh Lollard, from 1391–1393.)\n\nThe \"Crede\"'s content wholly conforms to Lollard views of the friars. Most of the charges against the friars are familiar from other works such as \"Jack Upland\", the \"Vae Octuplex\" or Wyclif's \"Trialogus\", and most are ultimately derived from William of Saint-Amour's \"De Periculis Novissimorum Temporum\" (1256). As in all Wycliffite satire, the friars are lecherous, covetous, greedy, vengeful, demanding extravagant donations for even the most elementary services. They seek out only the fattest corpses to bury, and live in ostentatious houses that are more like palaces than places of worship. They are the children of Lucifer rather than Saint Dominic or St Francis, and follow in the footsteps of Cain, the first treacherous \"frater\". But the fact that the poem's main approach is dramatic rather than didactic or polemic, and its frequent passages of striking physical description, elevate it beyond the vast bulk of antifraternal writing. Elizabeth Salter's charge of empty 'sensationalism' seems highly unjust. The poem's vicious and unremitting attacks are impressively constructed, and even entertaining in their lacerating cynicism. Plus, as von Nolcken and Barr have shown, there is a remarkable subtlety to the poem, as it draws on even the most purely philosophical aspects of Wyclif's system. The opposition between the friars and Piers is finely crafted. While the friars squabble and bicker with one another, the true (i.e., Lollard) Christians form a single unity; at the end of the poem, in the words of Barr, 'the voices of Peres, narrator and poet all merge' into a single 'I':\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2322224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322224", "title": "Excoriation disorder", "text": "Excoriation disorder\n\nExcoriation disorder is an obsessive-compulsive spectrum mental disorder that is characterized by the repeated urge or impulse to pick at one's own skin to the extent that either psychological or physical damage is caused.\n\nEpisodes of skin picking are often preceded or accompanied by tension, anxiety, or stress. In some cases, following picking, the affected person may feel depressed. During these moments, there is commonly a compulsive urge to pick, squeeze, or scratch at a surface or region of the body, often at the location of a perceived skin defect. When picking one may feel a sense of relief or satisfaction.\n\nThe region most commonly picked is the face, but other frequent locations include the arms, legs, back, gums, neck, shoulders, scalp, abdomen, chest, and extremities such as the fingernails, cuticles, and toenails. Most patients with excoriation disorder report having a primary area of the body that they focus their picking on, but they will often move to other areas of the body to allow their primary picking area to heal. Individuals with excoriation disorder vary in their picking behaviour; some do it briefly multiple times a day while others can do one picking session that can last for hours. The most common way to pick is to use the fingers although a significant minority of people use tools such as tweezers or needles.\n\nSkin picking often occurs as a result of some other triggering cause. Some common triggers are feeling or examining irregularities on the skin and feeling anxious or other negative feelings.\n\nComplications arising from excoriation disorder include: infection at the site of picking, tissue damage, and sepsis. Damage from picking can be so severe as to require skin grafting. Severe picking can cause epidermal abscesses. Severe cases of excoriation disorder can cause life-threatening injuries. For example, in one reported case a female picked a hole through the bridge of her nose, which required surgery to fix, and a 48-year-old female picked through the skin on her neck exposing the carotid artery. Pain in the neck or back can arise due to prolonged bent-over positions while engaging in the behavior. Besides physical injuries, excoriation disorder can cause severe physical scarring and disfigurement.\nExcoriation disorder can cause feelings of intense helplessness, guilt, shame, and embarrassment in individuals, and this greatly increases the risk of self-harm. Studies have shown that excoriation disorder presented suicidal ideation in 12% of individuals with this condition, suicide attempts in 11.5% of individuals with this condition, and psychiatric hospitalizations in 15% of individuals with this condition.\n\nThere have been many different theories regarding the causes of excoriation disorder including biological and environmental factors.\n\nA common hypothesis is that excoriation disorder is often a coping mechanism to deal with elevated levels of turmoil, arousal or stress within the individual, and that the individual has an impaired stress response. A review of behavioral studies found support in this hypothesis in that skin-picking appears to be maintained by automatic reinforcement within the individual.\n\nIn contrast to neurological theories, there are some psychologists who believe that picking behavior can be a result of repressed rage felt toward authoritarian parents. A similar theory holds that overbearing parents can cause the behavior to develop in their children.\n\nClinical studies have posited that there is a strong link between traumatic childhood events and excoriation disorder. Those with self-injurious disorders of the skin are found to also frequently report childhood sexual abuse. While attempting to produce diagnostic criteria for excoriation disorder, researchers conversed with 10 patients with the disorder and found that a majority reported personal problems before the picking began, and 4 reported on abuse they suffered in childhood or adolescence.\n\nThere is limited knowledge regarding the neurobiology that drives excoriation disorder, and there have been no neuroimaging studies of those with excoriation disorder.\n\nThose individuals that have excoriation disorder along with other diagnosed conditions report differing motivations for their picking. Those with both OCD and excoriation disorder report that they will pick their skin due to a perceived contamination of the skin, while those with both body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) and excoriation disorder reportedly pick to fix perceived imperfections in the skin.\n\nStudies have shown a linkage between dopamine and the urge to pick. Drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine, which increase the pharmacological effects of dopamine, have been shown to cause uncontrollable picking in users. These drugs can create the sensation of formication, which feels like something is crawling on or under the skin. Thus, excoriation disorder could result from a dysfunction in the dopamine reward functions.\n\nThere may be another neurological explanation for excoriation disorder: individuals with the condition have less motor-inhibitory control, but show no sign of difference in cognitive flexibility, when compared to individuals without the condition. Motor-inhibitory control is a function of the right lateralized frontostriatal circuit, which includes the right inferior frontal and bilateral anterior cingulate cortices. The impairment of motor-inhibitory control is similar to the neurological conditions of those who have problems suppressing inappropriate behaviors, such as abusing methamphetamine.\n\nThere is no significant evidence to suggest that skin picking disorders are due to inherited traits or genes, though there have been multiple small studies with similar conclusions in regards to the SAPAP3 gene. Excessive grooming by mice has been observed by researchers after deletion of the SAPAP3 gene. This observation led researchers to study the effects of the SAPAP3 gene on patients with trichotillomania—a disorder marked by the same behaviors directed at one′s own head and body hair. This study revealed a significant link between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the SAPAP3 gene and trichotillomania.\n\nThere has been controversy over the creation of a separate category in the DSM-5 for excoriation (skin picking) disorder. Two of the main reasons for objecting to the inclusion of excoriation disorder in the DSM-5 are: that excoriation disorder may just be a symptom of a different underlying disorder, e.g. OCD or BDD, and excoriation disorder is merely a bad habit and that by allowing this disorder to obtain its own separate category it would force the DSM to include a wide array of bad habits as separate syndromes, e.g., nail biting and nose-picking. Stein has argued that excoriation disorder does qualify as a separate syndrome and should be classified as its own category because: \n\nHowever, a review of the scientific literature by Jenkins et al. on excoriation disorder as a separate category in the DSM-5 concluded that such a distinction requires more evidence. Because excoriation disorder is different from other conditions and disorders that cause picking of the skin, it is important that any diagnosis of excoriation disorder take into account various other medical conditions as possible causes before diagnosing the patient with excoriation disorder. There are a variety of conditions that cause itching and skin picking including: eczema, psoriasis, diabetes, liver disease, Hodgkin's disease, polycythemia vera, systemic lupus, and Prader-Willi syndrome.\nIn order to better understand excoriation disorder, researchers have developed a variety of scales to categorize skin-picking behavior. These include the Skin-Picking Impact Scale (SPIS), and The Milwaukee Inventory for the Dimensions of Adult Skin-picking. The SPIS was created to measure how skin picking affects the individual socially, behaviorally, and emotionally.\n\nAs of the release of the fifth Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in May 2013, this disorder is classified as its own separate condition under \"Obsessive Compulsive and Related Disorders\" and is termed \"excoriation (skin-picking) disorder\". The diagnostic material is as follows:\n\n\nSince the DSM-5 (2013), excoriation disorder is classified as \"L98.1 Excoriation (skin-picking) disorder\" in ICD-10; and is no longer classified in \"Impulse control disorder\" (f63)\".\n\nExcoriation disorder is defined as \"repetitive and compulsive picking of skin which results in tissue damage\".\n\nIts most official name had been \"dermatillomania\" for some time. As of the release of the fifth Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in May 2013, excoriation disorder is classified as its own separate condition under \"Obsessive Compulsive and Related Disorders\" and is termed \"excoriation (skin-picking) disorder\".\n\nThe inability to control the urge to pick is similar to the urge to compulsively pull one's own hair, i.e., trichotillomania. Researchers have noted the following similarities between trichotillomania and excoriation disorder: the symptoms are ritualistic but there are no preceding obsessions; there are similar triggers for the compulsive actions; both conditions appear to play a role in modifying the arousal level of the subject; and the age of onset for both conditions is similar. There is also a high level of comorbidity between those that have trichotillomania and those that have excoriation disorder. A notable difference between these conditions is that skin picking seems to be dominated by females whereas trichotillomania is more evenly distributed across genders.\n\nResearch has also suggested that excoriation disorder may be thought of as a type of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Excoriation disorder and OCD are similar in that they both involve \"repetitive engagement in behaviors with diminished control\" and also both generally decrease anxiety.\n\nNevertheless, Odlaug and Grant have suggested that excoriation disorder is more akin to substance abuse disorder than OCD. They argue that excoriation disorder differs from OCD in the following fundamental ways: \nOdlaug and Grant have recognized the following similarities between individuals with dermatillomania and patients with addictions: \nOne study that supported the addiction theory of picking found that 79% of patients with excoriation disorder reported a pleasurable feeling when picking.\n\nOdlaug and Grant also argue that dermatillomania could have several different psychological causes, which would explain why some patients seem more likely to have symptoms of OCD, and others, of an addiction. They suggest that treating certain cases of excoriation as an addiction may yield more success than treating them as a form of OCD.\n\nKnowledge about effective treatments for excoriation disorder is sparse, despite the prevalence of the condition. There are two major classes of therapy for excoriation disorder: pharmacological and behavioral.\n\nIndividuals with excoriation disorder often do not seek treatment for their condition, largely due to feelings of embarrassment, alienation, lack of awareness, or belief that the condition cannot be treated. One study found that only 45% of individuals with excoriation disorder ever sought treatment, and only 19% ever received dermalogical treatment. Another study found that only 30% of individuals with this disorder sought treatment.\n\nThere are several different classes of pharmacological treatment agents that have some support for treating excoriation disorder: SSRIs; opioid antagonists; anti-epileptic agents; and glutamatergic agents. In addition to these classes of drugs, some other pharmacological products have been tested in small trials as well.\n\nAntipsychotic, antianxiety, antidepressant, and antiepileptic medications have all been used to treat skin picking, with varying degrees of success.\n\nSSRIs have shown to be effective in the treatment of OCD, which serves as an argument in favor of treating excoriation disorder with the same therapy. Unfortunately, clinical studies have not provided clear support for this, because there have not been large double-blind placebo-controlled trials of SSRI therapy for excoriation disorder. In fact, in a meta-analysis of pharmacological treatments of excoriation disorders, it was found that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and lamotrigine were no more effective than a placebo for longterm effects. \nReviews of treatment of excoriation disorder have shown that the following medications may be effective in reducing picking behavior: doxepin, clomipramine, naltrexone, pimozide, and olanzapine. Small studies of fluoxetine, an SSRI, in treating excoriation disorder showed that the drug reduced certain aspects of skin picking compared with a placebo, but full remission was not observed. One small study of patients with excoriation disorder treated with citalopram, another SSRI, showed that those who took the drug significantly reduced their scores on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale compared with a placebo, but that there was no significant decrease on the visual-analog scale of picking behavior.\n\nWhile there have been no human studies of opioid antagonists for the treatment of excoriation disorder, there have been studies showing that these products can reduce self-chewing in dogs with acral lick, which some have proposed is a good animal model for body-focused repetitive behavior. Furthermore, case reports support the use of these opioid antagonists to treat excoriation disorder. Opioid antagonists work by affecting dopamine circuitry, thereby decreasing the pleasurable effects of picking.\n\nAnother class of possible pharmacological treatments are glutamatergic agents such as n-acetyl cysteine (NAC). These products have shown some ability to reduce other problematic behaviors such as cocaine addiction and trichotillomania. Some case studies and some small studies of NAC have shown a decrease in picking by treatment with NAC compared with placebo.\n\nExcoriation disorder and trichotillomania have been treated with inositol.\n\nTopiramate, an anti-epileptic drug, has been used to treat excoriation disorder; in a small study of individuals with Prader–Willi syndrome, it was found to reduce skin picking.\n\nBehavioral treatments include habit reversal training, cognitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance-enhanced behavior therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT).\n\nSeveral studies have shown that habit reversal training associated with awareness training reduces skin-picking behavior in those individuals with excoriation disorder that do not have psychological disabilities. Habit reversal training can include awareness enhancement and competing response training. For example, in one study the competing response training required participants to make a closed fist for one minute instead of picking or in response to a condition that usually provokes picking behavior.\n\nThere are several different behavioral interventions that have been tested to treat excoriation disorder in the developmentally disabled.\n\nOne method is to have individuals wear a form of protective clothing that limits the ability of the patient to pick at their body, e.g., gloves or face mask.\n\nOther behavioral treatments attempt to change behavior through providing different incentives. Under Differential Reinforcement of Other Behavior (DRO), a patient is rewarded if able to abstain from the picking behavior for a certain amount of time. In contrast to DRO, Differential Reinforcement of Incompatible Behavior (DRI) rewards an individual for engaging in an alternative behavior that cannot physically occur at the same time as the problem behavior (e.g. sitting on your hands instead of picking at your skin). Lastly, differential reinforcement of alternative behavior rewards behavior that is not necessarily incompatible with the target behavior but serves the same function as the target behavior (e.g., providing people with a competing behavior to occupy their time instead of skin picking).\n\nAll of these techniques have been reported to have some success in small studies, but none has been tested in large enough populations to provide definitive evidence of their effectiveness.\n\nTentative evidence suggests that devices that provide feedback when the activity occurs can be useful.\n\nTypically, individuals with excoriation disorder find that the disorder interferes with daily life. Hindered by shame, embarrassment, and humiliation, they may take measures to hide their disorder by not leaving home, wearing long sleeves and pants even in heat, or covering visible damage to skin with cosmetics and/or bandages. When untreated, excoriation disorder can last between anywhere from 5–21 years. However, many doctors consider this disorder to be a permanent diagnosis.\n\nThe prevalence of excoriation disorder is not well understood.\n\nEstimates of prevalence of the condition range from 1.4 to 5.4% in the general population. One U.S. telephone survey found that 16.6% of respondents \"picked their skin to the point of noticeable tissue damage\" and that 1.4% would qualify as meeting the requirements of excoriation disorder. Another community survey found a rate of 5.4% had excoriation disorder. A survey of college students found a rate of 4%. One study found that among non-disabled adults, 63% of individuals engaged in some form of skin picking and 5.4% engaged in serious skin picking. Lastly, a survey of dermatology patients found that 2% suffered from excoriation disorder.\n\nIn some patients excoriation disorder begins with the onset of acne in adolescence, but the compulsion continues even after the acne has gone away. Skin conditions such as keratosis pilaris, psoriasis, and eczema can also provoke the behavior. In patients with acne, the grooming of the skin is disproportionate to the severity of the acne. Certain stressful events including marital conflicts, deaths of friends or family, and unwanted pregnancies have been linked to the onset of the condition. If excoriation disorder does not occur during adolescence another common age of onset is between the ages of 30 to 45. Additionally, many cases of excoriation disorder have been documented to begin in children under the age of 10. One small survey of patients with excoriation disorder found that 47.5% of them had an early onset of excoriation disorder that began before age 10. Traumatic childhood events may initiate the behavior.\n\nExcoriation disorder is statistically more common in females than in males.\n\nExcoriation disorder has a high rate of comorbidity with other psychiatric conditions, especially with mood and anxiety disorders . One survey of patients with excoriation disorder found that 56.7% also had a DSM-IV Axis-I disorder and 38% had alcohol- or drug-abuse problems. Studies have shown the following rates of psychiatric conditions found in patients with excoriation disorder: trichotillomania (38.3%), substance abuse (38%), major depressive disorder (approximately 31.7% to 58.1%), anxiety disorders (approximately 23% to 56%), obsessive-compulsive disorder (approximately 16.7% to 68%), and body dysmorphic disorder (approximately 26.8% to 44.9%). There are also higher rates of excoriation disorder in patients in psychiatric facilities; a study of adolescent psychiatric inpatients found that excoriation disorder was present in 11.8% of patients. It is also present at high rates with some other conditions: 44.9% of patients with body dysmorphic disorder also have excoriation disorder; 8.9% of patients with OCD have excoriation disorder; and 8.3% of patients with trichotillomania have excoriation disorder.\n\nSkin picking is also common in those with certain developmental disabilities; for example, Prader–Willi syndrome and Smith–Magenis syndrome. Studies have shown that 85% of people with Prader–Willi syndrome also engage in skin-picking. Children with developmental disabilities are also at an increased risk for excoriation disorder.\n\nExcoriation disorder also correlates with \"social, occupational, and academic impairments, increased medical and mental health concerns (including anxiety, depression, obsessive–compulsive disorder) ... and financial burden\". Excoriation disorder also has a high degree of comorbidity with occupational and marital difficulties.\n\nSubstance abuse is often present, and individuals with excoriation disorder are twice as likely to have first-degree relatives who have substance abuse disorders than those without the condition.\n\nSome cases of body-focused repetitive behaviors found in identical twins also suggest a hereditary factor.\n\nThe first known mention of excoriation disorder in the print can be found in 1898 by the French dermatologist Louis-Anne-Jean Brocq, describing an adolescent female patient who had uncontrolled picking of acne.\n\nExcoriation disorder has been the subject of several episodes of \"Obsessed\", a television documentary series that focuses on treatment of anxiety disorders.\nExcoriation disorder is shown as a symptom of Nina Sayers' anxiety and OCD in the movie \"Black Swan\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2322237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322237", "title": "Snape Maltings", "text": "Snape Maltings\n\nSnape Maltings is an arts complex on the banks of the River Alde at Snape, Suffolk, England. It is best known for its concert hall, which is one of the main sites of the annual Aldeburgh Festival.\n\nThe original purpose of the Maltings was the malting of barley for the brewing of beer; local barley, once malted, was sent from here to London and exported to mainland Europe. Today a collection of shops, galleries, restaurants and the Concert Hall fill the old buildings. The Alde Estuary is known for wildlife and river trips.\n\nNewson Garrett, a Victorian entrepreneur, built the Maltings in the 1800s; his name appears on plaques around the site. The river made Garrett decide to build a Maltings at this already busy port. Newson was ambitious and determined and in 1841 purchased the business of Osborne and Fennell, corn and coal merchants of Snape Bridge. From this port the Maltings began to evolve, using the River Alde to transport barley across Britain and into Europe on Thames barges. Within three years of his arrival, Newson Garrett was shipping 17,000 quarters of barley a year from Snape. Much of this barley would have been destined for breweries, where it had first to be malted. Newson saw an opportunity. Snape was in the heart of good agricultural land, and halfway between the brewing area of Norwich and London. Demand from the London breweries was growing fast, and it was becoming impractical to make malt and brew beer on the same premises. In 1854 he began malting at Snape, and was soon shipping malt, rather than barley to the breweries.\n\nThe Maltings process at Snape came to an end in the 1960s as Swonnell and Son went into liquidation and seven acres of industrial buildings were left vacant. Thirty acres of land was offered for sale, including dwellings and an inn. It was difficult to imagine how such functional structures could be put to different use. However George Gooderham, a local farmer and businessman, recognised the potential. He purchased the site and set about finding alternative uses for the buildings.\n\nBy the 1960s the Aldeburgh Music Festival was outgrowing the limited space available in the Jubilee Hall. Benjamin Britten started to look around for somewhere to build a concert hall. Britten had the vision to see the largest Malthouse, in its magnificent setting overlooking the saltings as a possible site. Negotiations began with George Gooderham and after little more than a year Snape Maltings Concert Hall was ready to be opened by the Queen at the start of the 1967 Aldeburgh Festival.\n\nThe composer Benjamin Britten was inspired by the vast skies and moody seas of the Suffolk coast, and in 1948, along with singer Peter Pears and writer Eric Crozier, he founded the Aldeburgh Festival. Britten and Pears made a point of educating and supporting young artists. They brought together international stars and emerging talent, including world-renowned figures such as Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Yehudi Menuhin, Sviatoslav Richter and Mstislav Rostropovich, and young stars in the making such as Elisabeth Söderström, Murray Perahia and Julian Bream.\n\nAt first the Festival used local halls and churches but in 1967, Britten and Pears created a permanent home at Snape, 5 miles from Aldeburgh, by converting the Victorian maltings into an 832-seat venue. Within five years Britten and Pears had reclaimed more buildings on the site to establish a centre for talented young musicians.\n\nIn 2006 Aldeburgh Music purchased a 999-year lease of the Snape Maltings Concert Hall, investing around £14 million in new studios and rehearsal spaces which came into use in 2009. The \"Creative Campus\" at Snape Maltings has four performance venues (from 70 to 830 capacity) and over 20 rehearsal and public spaces.\n\nSnape Maltings Concert Hall, Concert Hall Gallery, Oyster Bar and Restaurant\n\nBuilt by Newson Garrett in the mid-19th century, the 832-seat Concert Hall began life as a malthouse. \nThe conversion of the building was undertaken by Arup Associates, with the acoustics supervised by Derek Sugden. Work started on site in 1966.\nOfficially opened in 1967 by HM Queen Elizabeth II, the Hall suffered serious fire damage two years later, re-opening in time for the Aldeburgh Festival the following year.\n\nBritten Studio, Jerwood Kiln Studio, rehearsal rooms. Opened in May 2009, the Hoffmann Building features two spaces suitable for performances as well as a number of additional rehearsal rooms, office space and a social area. The centrepiece of the building is the new Britten Studio, designed to have an excellent and flexible acoustic with a high level of sound insulation for recording. Ideal for orchestral rehearsals, it can also be used as a 340-seat venue.\n\nThe Jerwood Kiln Studio, which seats up to 80 people in a flexible configuration, is an ideal space for smaller groups to rehearse, and is equipped for video and electro-acoustic installations. The Studio retains the double-height roof and much of the existing fabric of the original kiln structure.\n\nPeter Pears Recital Room, Holst Library, rehearsal rooms. A former barley store, the Britten–Pears Building was officially opened in 1979 by HM Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.\n\nThe Holst Library is connected to the Maltings. Many of the original contents were donated by Imogen Holst, who was a close friend of Benjamin Britten and an artistic director of the Aldeburgh Festival from 1956 to 1977, and it was named the Gustav Holst Library as a memorial to her father. According to her press release for the Aldeburgh Festival Office, \"the Gustav Holst Library will be a working library for the use of the students. It is being called after him in gratitude for his music and his teaching.\"\n\nThe library was officially opened by HM the Queen Mother and is open by appointment. It is situated in two rooms on the second floor of the BPP buildings in the Snape Maltings complex. The collection comprises books, scores and audio materials (LP, tape and CD) covering many genres. Much of the Library's stock is available for searching on the web catalogue of the Britten-Pears Library.\n\n"}

It was released for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows platforms in 1998. \"Tomb Raider III\" is the third title in the \"Tomb Raider\" video game series and a sequel to \"Tomb Raider II\". The story of the game follows archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft as she embarks upon a quest to recover four pieces of a meteorite that are scattered across the world. To progress through the game, the player must explore five locations (India, South Pacific, London, Nevada, and Antarctica) and complete a series of levels that involve solving puzzles, traverse dangerous locations, and defeating enemies.\n\n\"Tomb Raider III\" is built on an upgraded version of the \"Tomb Raider\" engine used by its predecessors. The engine offers better speed efficiency and new graphical features such as coloured lighting and triangular polygons, allowing developers to achieve greater detail and more complex geometry. The game was designed to be more in line with the puzzle-solving gameplay of the original \"Tomb Raider\" as opposed to the more shooting-oriented style of \"Tomb Raider II\".\n\n\"Tomb Raider III\" was accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign and was a commercial success, selling around six million copies worldwide. Although the game received generally favourable reviews, it did not fare as well as its two predecessors, with critics generally agreeing that the game failed to change the same tried and tested formula. Reviewers also noted the game's difficult and unforgiving gameplay. Eidos released an expansion pack, \"Tomb Raider III: The Lost Artefact\", in 2000. The expansion includes six levels set in several European locations. \"Tomb Raider III\" was ported to Mac OS computers in 1999 and was released as a \"PSOne Classic\" on the PlayStation Network in 2011.\n\n\"Tomb Raider III\" is a single-player action-adventure game where the player controls the protagonist, Lara Croft, from a third-person perspective through five locations: India, South Pacific, London, Nevada, and Antarctica. Once the player completes the first location (India), the following three (South Pacific, London, and Nevada) can be played in any order before the final location (Antarctica) closes the game. Each location features a series of enclosed levels that involve solving puzzles, jumping over obstacles, and defeating enemies. Most puzzles involve rearranging items, manipulating switches, or pushing objects. As Lara, the player can run, jump, climb, crawl, \"monkey swing\" across certain overhead frames, and swim and dive underwater for a limited period of time. Lara can also sprint to gain a temporary burst of greater speed while running, which is useful for escaping errant boulders and other immediate disasters.\n\nTo defeat enemies, the player can use a variety of weapons, including dual pistols, dual Uzis, a Desert Eagle, a shotgun, an MP5 submachine gun, a grenade launcher, a rocket launcher, and a harpoon gun for underwater use. The dual pistols have infinite ammunition and are Lara's default weapons, while the other weapons have finite ammunition and must be found in the levels. At one point in the game, Lara will be stripped of all her weapons, leaving the player defenceless and forced to use stealth, before recovering her pistols later. Lara has a certain amount of health that decreases if she falls from a great height or when she is attacked by enemies. If Lara's health is fully depleted, the player must start the game again from a previous save point. Saving the player's progress on the PlayStation version of the game requires a memory card and consumes a Save Crystal from Lara's inventory. These can be found throughout each level and do not require the player to save the game at the pick-up spot.\n\nA significant portion of the game takes place underwater. Some pools are inhabited by piranhas that can kill Lara within seconds, while others have streams with currents that can pull her in a fixed direction, preventing the player from being able to swim back or grab onto a ledge. Furthermore, the water in the Antarctica levels is too cold for Lara to swim through for more than a few seconds. The player can also wade through quicksand, but at the risk of drowning Lara. Some levels require the player to use vehicles. For example, the kayak helps Lara fight her way down rapids in the Madubu Gorge level, while an underwater propeller unit allows her to explore deep water areas in the Lud's Gate level. Other vehicles include a quad bike, a boat, and minecarts. Flares may be used to explore darkened areas. Ammunition, flares, and health recovery items are dispersed among the levels to help players increase their resources. The game also features a tutorial level where the player can practice Lara's moves and combat abilities.\n\nA corporation called RX Tech excavates the crash site of a meteorite that impacted on Antarctica millions of years ago and finds strange Rapa Nui-like statues alongside the grave of one of HMS \"Beagle\"'s sailors. Meanwhile, archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft is searching for an artefact known as the Infada Stone in the ruins of an ancient Indian Hindu temple once inhabited by the Infada tribe. After taking the artefact from a researcher working for RX Tech, Lara is approached by RX Tech scientist Dr. Willard, who explains that Polynesians came across a meteorite crater in Antarctica thousands of years ago and found that it held incredible power. Using rock from the meteorite, they crafted four crystalline artefacts, one of which is the Infada Stone. They fled Antarctica for unknown reasons, but in the 19th century, a group of sailors travelling with Charles Darwin came to Antarctica and rediscovered the artefacts. The four artefacts were distributed across the globe. Dr. Willard has been able to track the artefacts by using the diary of one of the sailors. Lara agrees to help him find the other three.\n\nTravelling to a South Pacific island, Lara encounters a wounded soldier who gives her hints about the existence of a powerful deity. While pursuing the deity, Lara learns that one of Darwin's sailors brought one of the artefacts to the island. She infiltrates a temple and defeats the deity, who has immense power granted by the second artefact, the Ora Dagger. In London, Lara searches for the third artefact, the Eye of Isis, now in the possession of Sophia Leigh, the head of a cosmetics corporation. Lara learns that the corporation has performed experiments on humans in order to achieve immortality and eternal youth for Sophia's personal gain. Lara confronts Sophia in her office and ultimately obtains the artefact. In Nevada, Lara makes her way through a desert canyon and tries to enter Area 51, where the fourth artefact, Element 115, is located in an alien spacecraft guarded by the US government. She is taken prisoner after her attempted break-in fails. Freeing herself, she escapes the security compound and stows away in a truck to Area 51, where she obtains the artefact.\n\nAfter collecting all four artefacts, Lara travels to Antarctica and discovers that Dr. Willard had been using the knowledge gained from the meteorite to perform experiments on his own men, turning them into horrible mutations. Angered by this revelation, she confronts Dr. Willard, who reveals that he is planning to encourage the mutations, only on a global scale, using the combined power of the artefacts and the meteorite from which they were carved. As Lara voices her opposition to his operation, Willard betrays her, steals the artefacts, and disappears into the excavation site. After fighting more mutants and navigating the treacherous ruins of the ancient city built atop the meteorite crater, Lara faces Willard, who has now used the power of the four artefacts to greatly speed up the evolutionary processes of the human body and thereby turned himself into a spider-like creature. Lara deactivates the meteorite by recovering the artefacts, kills the mutated Willard, and escapes by helicopter.\n\n\"Tomb Raider III\" was developed by Core Design and published by Eidos Interactive as a sequel to the 1997 title \"Tomb Raider II\". Originally, Core Design envisioned \"Tomb Raider III\" as a \"next generation\" \"Tomb Raider\" game built on an entirely new game engine with a new animation system. As artist Stuart Atkinson explained, the \"Tomb Raider\" team wanted at least two years to develop the game in order to genuinely advance the series, but the producers said that, as with \"Tomb Raider II\", development would be completed in under a year because there was a strong consumer demand for it. For the original team, who had been living with the series' demanding development schedules for two consecutive years, \"it was just too much\", Atkinson said. As a result, a new team was brought together from other Core Design projects to build a \"Tomb Raider\" game for 1998, giving the original team more time to develop their next-generation project.\n\nActual development on \"Tomb Raider III\" began in December 1997. At the time, lead programmer Martin Gibbins, who previously worked on the 1996 title \"Blam! Machinehead\", was tweaking the old \"Tomb Raider\" engine to build a new game with a stronger emphasis on action and shooting. The new team considered Gibbins' additional work to the engine valuable and decided to use it as a basis for the 1998 \"Tomb Raider\" game, which was originally intended to be a spin-off called \"The Further Adventures of Lara Croft\". However, as development progressed and more ideas were introduced, the company considered the number of changes enough to justify a complete sequel. The PlayStation served as the lead platform for the game, while the Microsoft Windows release is simply a conversion with slightly improved visuals. As a result, everything was built around the capabilities of the PlayStation hardware, with 16-bit palettes and high-resolution graphics, as opposed to the 8-bit palettes and \"pseudo medium\" resolution of the earlier titles, Core Design CEO Jeremy Smith explained.\n\nThe upgraded engine offered better speed efficiency and new graphical features. While both the original \"Tomb Raider\" and \"Tomb Raider II\" used a grid system where developers could build the levels with a set of blocks, \"Tomb Raider III\"s system incorporated triangular polygons, allowing developers to achieve greater detail and more complex architectural structures. The triangles also allowed developers to implement the game's quicksand and rippling water features. The dynamic lighting system was improved with coloured lighting and better water reflection, making \"Tomb Raider III\" more atmospheric than its predecessors. The team also implemented new weather effects such as rain, snow, and wind. The game features more particle effects, offering more realistic explosions and smoke. All the textures used in the game were drawn in true colour before being rendered by the graphics engine, resulting in a better output quality.\n\n\"Tomb Raider III\" was designed more in line with the puzzle-solving gameplay of the original \"Tomb Raider\" as opposed to the more shooting-oriented style of \"Tomb Raider II\". The levels were designed to be less linear than before with the goal of giving players multiple routes to complete each one. The game's five locations were decided upon before the plot was conceived. According to producer Mike Schmitt, the team opted to \"just take a globe, spin it, and see where it lands, and whether it's an interesting location or not.\" Once the setting had been decided upon, a storyline linking all the locations was written. Lara's range of abilities was expanded with moves such as the duck, crawl, dash, and \"monkey swing\". The 1995 film \"Desperado\" was an influence on Lara's gun play and new moves. Developers initially considered the possibility of implementing hand-to-hand combat, but the idea was rejected because it would have required giving enemies new combat animations.\n\nA specialist was hired to enhance the game's artificial intelligence and give enemies more lifelike behaviour. In previous \"Tomb Raider\" games, enemies would simply run at Lara and attack immediately, whereas in \"Tomb Raider III\", enemies can pop out of the dark and attack the player, or retreat back into the level and regroup to attack later. A stealth element partially inspired by Rare's 1997 hit \"GoldenEye 007\" was also introduced, giving players the option of sneaking around and avoid detection. New vehicles that are critical to complete certain levels were added; the team also experimented with the idea of putting Lara on horseback, but they ultimately discarded it. The development of the game took eleven months to complete, and incorporating all the new ideas into the engine was considered the most difficult task of the project.\n\nThe release of \"Tomb Raider III\" was accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign. To promote the game, English model Nell McAndrew was hired to appear as Lara Croft on a press tour across Italy, Spain, Germany, the US, and Australia. McAndrew made appearances on various multimedia outlets, including TV shows, radio stations, and department stores, while Lara Croft appeared on the front cover of most UK games magazines. Other highlights included French TV advertisements for the SEAT car manufacturer and a music video for the German band Die Ärzte. British sports lifestyle brand Animal designed and merchandised a range of Lara Croft clothes and accessories, while Core Design launched its own clothing articles. In May 1998, a demonstration of the game was presented at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta, Georgia. The show included a virtual appearance of Lara, which allowed the audience to ask her questions. According to Core Design's PR manager Susie Hamilton, a total of £1.7 million was spent on the marketing campaign.\n\n\"Tomb Raider III\" was released for the Microsoft Windows and PlayStation platforms on 20 November 1998. Upon release, some minor bugs in the game were detected, the most significant of which prevented players from completing the Temple Ruins level if they saved the game in a specific area and then went back to that area. Although the bugs in the Microsoft Windows version were addressed with the release of a patch, they remained in the original PlayStation discs. To prevent further issues, Core Design quickly burned new gold discs with an updated version of the game. The game was ported to Mac OS computers in 1999. An expansion pack, \"Tomb Raider III: The Lost Artefact\", was released for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS computers in March 2000. The expansion includes six levels set in several European locations, where Lara must learn of the existence of a fifth meteorite piece called the Hand of Rathmore. In 2011, the game was released as a \"PSOne Classic\" on the PlayStation Network.\n\nAlthough \"Tomb Raider III\" received generally favourable reviews from critics, it did not fare as well as its two predecessors. \"Edge\" considered \"Tomb Raider III\" \"a valid addition to the growing franchise\", stating that it offers more attractive graphics and more innovation than \"Tomb Raider II\", while \"Next Generation\" called it the biggest and most rewarding game of the series. \"CVG\" described it as \"a perfect mix of the exploration and puzzles of the original, and the more-to-shoot nature of the sequel.\" Other critics, however, felt that the game failed to change the same tried and tested formula. In its review, IGN said that \"Tomb Raider III\" \"solves none of its original dilemmas, and as it stands now, the exploration-adventure genre—one that was revolutionized by \"Tomb Raider\"—is in the exact spot it was two years ago.\"\n\nWriting for GameSpot, reviewer Joe Fielder highlighted the graphics for their new lighting effects and varied textures, saying that they improve the gameplay experience because they make it easier for players to identify ledges and jump-off points. Douglass Perry of IGN remarked that the upgraded engine made the game look better than its predecessors, but overall considered \"Tomb Raider III\" to be outdated, especially when compared to newer engines that were released at the time. \"Edge\" felt that the old controls did not suit the more complex environments and criticised the game's lack of narrative and cinematic presentation.\n\nThe game's difficult and unforgiving gameplay frustrated critics. Game Revolution explained that, while in previous \"Tomb Raider\" games \"instant death came about if you were trying to rush through an area and you did something stupid\", every step in \"Tomb Raider III\" \"is a potential threat of instant death, no matter how careful you're trying to be.\" The publication went so far as to call \"Tomb Raider III\" \"a marketing concept\", stating that the game is so difficult that it is impossible to beat without buying a strategy guide. Similarly, \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" criticised the game for being rushed and highly frustrating, noting that it has \"too many instances of cheap deaths.\" The magazine also remarked that the stealth elements in the Nevada levels were ineffective, especially when compared to Konami's \"Metal Gear Solid\".\n\nThe game's new vehicles, improved artificial intelligence of enemies, and nonlinear gameplay were generally highlighted positively. \"The Electric Playground\" said that progressing through the different locations in a nonlinear fashion makes Lara's adventuring more diverse and rewarding. \"CVG\"s Alez Huhtala praised the fact that players must collect Save Crystals to save their progress in the PlayStation version of the game, as he felt that \"Tomb Raider II\"s option to save the game at any time made the game very easy and removed tension. In contrast, Joe Rybicki of \"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine\" felt that the save system was \"a poorly thought-out return to one of the most irritating aspects of the original game\", making \"Tomb Raider III\" \"much more frustrating than it should be\". Nevertheless, he concluded that players can still \"find Lara a rewarding and addictive—if sometimes frustrating—companion.\"\n\nUpon release, \"Tomb Raider III\" topped the UK games charts and was the German market's second-best-selling computer game of 1998, behind \"Anno 1602\". At the 1999 Milia festival in Cannes, it took home a \"Platinum\" prize for revenues above €68 million in the European Union during the previous year. This made it the highest-grossing game in Europe for 1998. As of 2009, \"Tomb Raider III\" had sold around six million copies worldwide.\n"}
{"id": "2322250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322250", "title": "Jeronimus Cornelisz", "text": "Jeronimus Cornelisz\n\nJeronimus Cornelisz ( – 2 October 1629) was a Dutch Frisian apothecary and Dutch East India Company merchant who sailed aboard the merchant ship . After the ship was wrecked on 4 June 1629, in the Houtman Abrolhos, a chain of coral islands off the west coast of Australia, Francisco Pelsaert, the expedition's commander, went to get help from the Dutch settlements in Indonesia, returning several months later. While he was away Cornelisz led one of the bloodiest mutinies in history, for which he was eventually tried, convicted and hanged.\n\nCornelisz was probably born in the Frisian capital of Leeuwarden, where he grew up in a nonconformist household. His mother—and likely his father, too—belonged to the Netherlands' Mennonite Church, members of an Anabaptist church. It has been speculated that they may have had links with some of the more militant Anabaptist movements, such as the Batenburgers, that flourished in the Dutch Republic during the 16th century.\n\nThe young Jeronimus was well educated, probably at the Latin School at Dokkum, and followed his father into the family trade by training to become an apothecary. He qualified around the year 1623, and practiced in his home town until 1627. He left that year apparently as a result of disagreements with the town council. Cornelisz moved to the much larger Dutch city of Haarlem, where he opened up an apothecary shop near the centre of the town.\n\nIn November 1627, he and his wife had a son, but the child died after fewer than three months after being placed in the care of a wet nurse. The cause of death was established as syphilis, considered a scandal, and Cornelisz became embroiled in a legal action against the nurse, seeking to prove that his child had contracted the disease from her and not from his wife. With his reputation and future business prospects destroyed, Cornelisz was forced to realize what he could by selling off his shop and assets.\n\nWhether Cornelisz actually was acquainted with Johannes van der Beeck, he left Haarlem within a few weeks after the painter's trial and the ruin of his own prospects. Cornelisz went to Amsterdam and took service with the Dutch East India Company (VOC). He was posted to the , which sailed for Java, in the Dutch East Indies, in October 1628. Sea voyages in this era were often marked by deaths from shipboard epidemics of infectious and nutritional deficiency disease, scurvy being particularly common.\n\nCornelisz, whose main motive in signing on such a venture seems to have been to escape his degraded social and economic position, allegedly became friendly with the \"Batavia\"s skipper, Ariaen Jacobsz, in the course of the ship's long voyage. He and Jacobsz supposedly became discontented with the leadership of the commander of the ship, the VOC commodore, Francisco Pelsaert, and according to the book later written by Pelsaert, almost immediately plotted a mutiny – although this would have been an extremely difficult undertaking given it was a major VOC ship with a paid crew and armed soldiers guarding valuables.\n\nFor some reason, Pelsaert stayed in his cabin for much of the voyage, even though he was responsible for the ship. He later claimed the confession tortured out of Cornelisz confirmed that Jacobsz had deliberately steered the \"Batavia\" off course. The ship subsequently ran aground on a reef in the Abrolhos Islands and was lost.\n\nMore than 200 survivors made their way ashore, where they discovered there was no shelter, food, or drinking water. As deaths from dehydration began, Pelsaert, Jacobsz, and all the officers left in the only boat, and although telling the others they were taking a trip looking for water, they eventually embarked on a month long voyage to Java.\n\nCornelisz was left on the island with people of lower status and was able to establish himself as a leader. This could not be considered a mutiny as no proper authority had been appointed by the officers before their hasty departure. Cornelisz's rule in the Abrolhos became criminal when he aimed at removing those who the very limited food and water would have to be shared with. Some were tricked and secretly killed. Others such as a group of soldiers including Wiebbe Hayes, were sent to a nearby island to search for water. The only other candidate for chief was the minister, who had his family—apart from his daughter—killed and was intimidated thereafter. Rain eventually ameliorated the drinking water problem; food, however, remained insufficient. \n\nCornelisz established a brutal personal rule in the islands, backed by men who had plotted with him on board ship. When later questioned they said they had been obeying orders from the recognized leader that Cornelisz seemed to be. At first covertly, then more and more openly the survivors not in Cornelisz's faction were killed or sent away to the near islands, or escaped there. In all, Cornelisz and his henchmen were responsible for the deaths of between 110 and 124 men, women, and children over a two-month period. Their victims were drowned, strangled, hacked to pieces, or bludgeoned to death singly or in large groups. Seven surviving women were forced into sexual slavery. The most attractive, Lucretia Jans, was reserved for Cornelisz. Cornelisz's faction then began killing those dispersed on the other various islands, who presented a threat through now being more collectively numerous than his own men.\n\nThe group of soldiers—including Wiebbe Hayes—that had been dispatched to a nearby island to search for water, unexpectedly found it. They sent a smoke signal, which drew survivors to warn of the killings. They set up a hilltop stonework defense against the Cornelisz faction, which now faced a forewarned and re-enforced group in good health. After a pair of unsuccessful attacks, Cornelisz tried personally to negotiate with Hayes's men, then moved in for a final attack.\n\nAccording to Pelsaert's account, he arrived at exactly the right moment—on the —to stop Cornelisz's lieutenants annihilating the resistance, and thwarting an intention to seizing the rescue ship, massacre its crew, and turn pirate in the Indian Ocean. How Cornelisz and his band armed with few muskets could possibly have hoped to overcome a Dutch East India Company ship's crew and marines is not explained by the account given in Pelsaert's book.\n\nCornelisz and his men were subsequently tortured into confession. In the Pelsaert account that is the only source, a strictly Calvinist worldview of the time portrays Cornelisz's as an inherently evil disbeliever in hell, although his group swore religious oaths. Cornelisz himself maintained he was simply trying to make sure he survived. VOC authorities were not impressed with Pelsaert's stewardship of their valuable ship and assets, and he was not allowed to take up the post he had been sailing to.\n\nCornelisz was tried on the islands, found guilty of mutiny, and hanged along with half a dozen of his men. Both of his hands were amputated prior to the hanging – it appears with a hammer and chisel. The remaining mutineers were taken back to Java and tried; many were subsequently executed. Ariaen Jacobsz apparently died in the dungeons of Castle Batavia.\n\nIn the historical work, \"Batavia's Graveyard\", which analyzes the incident based on research in Dutch archives, amongst other sources, author Mike Dash theorizes that Cornelisz was almost certainly psychopathic.\n\nDash suggests this is shown by Cornelisz' often erratic behavior on the islands, his unattainable dreams of setting up a personal kingdom in the islands, and his complete assurance that he could do no wrong and that God himself inspired all of his deeds. Dash argues that this is connected to heretical ideas he had picked up during his supposed acquaintance with the controversial painter Johannes van der Beeck.\n\n"}

One of the earliest cases was the copper poisoning caused by drainage from the Ashio Copper Mine in Tochigi Prefecture, beginning as early as 1878. Repeated floods occurred in the Watarase River basin, and 1,600 hectares of farmland and towns and villages in Tochigi and Gunma prefectures were damaged by the floodwater, which contained excessive inorganic copper compounds from the Ashio mine. The local breeders led by Shōzō Tanaka, a member of the Lower House from Tochigi appealed to the prefecture and the government to call a halt to the mining operations. Although the mining company paid compensatory money and the government engaged in the embankment works of the Watarase River, no fundamental solution of the problem was achieved.\n\nJapan is the world's leading importer of both exhaustible and renewable natural resources and one of the largest consumers of fossil fuels.\n\nCurrent Japanese environmental policy and regulations were the consequence of a number of environmental disasters in the 1950s and 1960s. Cadmium poisoning from industrial waste in Toyama Prefecture was discovered to be the cause of the extremely painful . People in Minamata City in Kumamoto Prefecture were poisoned by methylmercury drained from the chemical factory, known as the \"Minamata disease\". The number of casualties in Minamata is 6,500 as of November 2006.\n\nIn Yokkaichi, a port in Mie Prefecture, air pollution caused by sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide emissions led to a rapid increase in the number of people suffering from asthma and bronchitis. In urban areas photochemical smog from automotive and industrial exhaust fumes also contributed to a rise in respiratory problems. In the early 1970s, chronic arsenic poisoning attributed to dust from arsenic mines occurred in Shimane and Miyazaki Prefectures.\n\nConsumers Union of Japan was founded in 1969 to deal with health problems and false claims by companies, as Japan's rampant industrial development was seen as causing problems for consumers and citizens. In the 1970s, the Consumers Union of Japan led the opposition to nuclear power, calling for a nationwide Anti-Nuclear Power Week Campaign.\n\nIn the 1990s, Japan's environmental legislation was further tightened. In 1993 the government reorganized the environment law system and legislated the \"Basic Environment Law\" () and related laws. The law includes restriction of industrial emissions, restriction of products, restriction of wastes, improvement of energy conservation, promotion of recycling, restriction of land utilization, the arrangement of environmental pollution control programs, relief of victims and provision for sanctions. The Environment Agency was promoted to full-fledged Ministry of the Environment in 2001, to deal with the deteriorating international environmental problems.\n\nIn 1984 the Environmental Agency had issued its first white paper. In the 1989 study, citizens thought environmental problems had improved compared with the past, nearly 1.7% thought things had improved, 31% thought that they had stayed the same, and nearly 21% thought that they had worsened. Some 75% of those surveyed expressed concern about endangered species, shrinkage of rain forests, expansion of deserts, destruction of the ozone layer, acid rain, and increased water and air pollution in developing countries. Most believed that Japan, alone or in cooperation with other industrialized countries, had the responsibility to solve environmental problems. In the 2007 opinion poll, 31.8% of the people answered environmental conservation activity leads to more economic development, 22.0% answered the environmental activity does not always obstruct the economic, 23.3% answered environmental conservation should be given preference even if it may obstruct the economic and 3.2％ answered economic development should place priority than environmental conservation.\n\nThe OECD's first Environmental Performance Review of Japan was published in 1994, which applauded the nation for decoupling its economic development from air pollution, as the nation's air quality improved while the economy thrived. However, it received poorer marks for water quality, as its rivers, lakes and coastal waters did not meet quality standards. Another report in 2002 said that the mix of instruments used to implement environmental policy is highly effective and regulations are strict, well enforced and based on strong monitoring capacities.\n\nIn the 2006 environment annual report, the Ministry of Environment reported that current major issues are global warming and preservation of the ozone layer, conservation of the atmospheric environment, water and soil, waste management and recycling, measures for chemical substances, conservation of the natural environment and the participation in the international cooperation.\n\nJapan burns close to two thirds of its waste in municipal and industrial incinerators. In 1999, some experts estimated 70 percent of the world's waste incinerators were located in Japan. Combined with incinerator technologies of the time, this caused Japan to have the highest level of dioxin in its air of all G20 nations. In 2019, technological progress had brought the problem of dioxins under control, no longer posing a major threat. In 2001, the US Department of Justice brought suit against Japan for the deaths of U.S. service-members at Naval Air Facility Atsugi caused by a nearby waste incinerator known as Jinkanpo Atsugi Incinerator. This has called into question the Japanese government line that the thousands of incinerators in Japan are safe.\n\nAs a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol, and host of the 1997 conference which created it, Japan is under treaty obligations to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions level by 6% less than the level in 1990, and to take other steps related to curbing climate change. Japan is the world's fifth-biggest emission emitter The Cool Biz campaign introduced under former Prime Minister of Japan Junichiro Koizumi was targeted at reducing energy use through the reduction of air conditioning use in government offices.\n\nIn January 2017 the Japanese environment ministry said that 70% of the Sekisei lagoon in Okinawa, Japan's biggest coral reef, had been killed by coral bleaching.\n\nJapan maintains one-third of its electric production from nuclear power plants. While a majority of Japanese citizens generally supported the use of existing nuclear reactors, since the nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on March 11, 2011, this support seems to have shifted to a majority wanting Japan to phase out nuclear power. Former Prime Minister Naoto Kan was the first leading politician to openly voice his opposition to Japan's dependence upon nuclear energy and suggested a phasing out of nuclear energy sources towards other sources of renewable energy. Objections against the plan to construct further plants has grown as well since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami which triggered the nuclear melt down of three reactors at the Fukushima dai ichi plant in Eastern Japan.\n\nThe treatment of radioactive wastes also became a subject of discussion in Japan. New spent-nuclear-fuel reprocessing plant was constructed in Rokkasho in 2008, the site of the underground nuclear-waste repository for the HLW and LLW has not yet been decided. Some local cities announced a plan to conduct an environmental study at the disposal site, but citizens' groups strongly oppose the plan.\n\nIn Japanese diets, fish and its products are more prominent than other types of meat. Because of the depletion of ocean stocks in the late 20th century, Japan's total annual fish catch has been diminishing rapidly. Japan, along with the United States and the European Union, occupies the large part of international fish trade. Japanese fish catches were the third in the world in 2000, following China and Peru. The United States, Chile, Indonesia, the Russian Federation and India were other major countries.\n\nBy 2004, the number of adult Atlantic Bluefin Tuna capable of spawning had plummeted to roughly 19 percent of the 1975 level in the western half of the ocean. Japan has a quarter of the world supply of the five big species: bluefin, southern bluefin, bigeye, yellowfin and albacore.\n\nWhaling for research purposes continued even after the moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986. This whaling program has been criticized by environmental protection groups and anti-whaling countries, who say that the program is not for scientific research.\n\nThe massive nationwide rebuilding efforts in the aftermath of World War II, and the development of the following decades, led to even further urbanization and construction. The construction industry in Japan is one of its largest, and while Japan maintains a great many parks and other natural spaces, even in the hearts of its cities, there are few major restrictions on where and how construction can be undertaken. Alex Kerr, in his books \"Lost Japan\" and \"Dogs & Demons\", is one of a number of authors who focuses heavily on the environmental problems related to Japan's construction industry, and the industry's lobbying power preventing the introduction of stricter zoning laws and other environmental issues.\n\n\n\n\"This article includes text from the public domain Library of Congress \"Country Studies\" at http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/.\"\n\n\n"}

The term derives from Greek ἴσος meaning \"equal\" and κρατεῖν meaning \"to have power\", or \"to rule\".\n\nAn Isocracy is based on a legal right of isonomia in political and economic systems, ranging from equality under law to equality in governance. To achieve this, an isocracy both combines and expands features of liberal rights and those in democratic rule. According to the nascent political movement of the same name an Isocracy embodies individual autonomy by extension informed consent and natural resources as the source of public income.\n\nFurther, advocates of isocracy claim it addresses the common criticisms of democracy (e.g., Tyranny of the Majority and Demagogy) by limiting public governance to the public sphere and private governance to the private sphere. With protections embodied through constitutions, thus not being subject to the vagaries of popular opinion, an isocracy is secular, republican, and does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, etc.\n\nIn terms of organization, an isocracy provides for a federal network and encourages a mutualist economic organisation. Claiming that the army and police are an arm of class-rule, an isocracy also argues in that public peace, defense and emergency services can be managed through inclusive militia.\n\nThe combination of these features has led Isocracy advocates to claim that they represent \"the best elements of the modern traditions of liberal, socialist and anarchist thought.\" \n\nThe first recorded use of the term was by the Reverend Sydney Smith in 1845, where opposition was expressed to the idea of equal rule for \"all units of society\"; Smith noted that the young should not have the same authority as the old and challenged isocrats to support voting and political rights for women, which was considered an extremist position at the time. An early recorded use of the word by a political organisation was by Grant Allen in the formation of the Independent Labour Party, arguing for equal rights for citizens. The history of the ILP incorporates liberalism, market socialism and co-operative societies:\n\nAs an incorporated association in Australia, the Isocracy Network Inc., has continued this tradition of libertarian and co-operative socialism as a member of the Alliance of the Libertarian Left. For a short period there was also a proposed Isocratic Party of Canada (former domain https://web.archive.org/web/20110202114418/http://isocraticcanada.com/), but that initiative appears to be defunct. \n\nFinally, the Greek Cypriot Chris Neophytou offers a more conservative perspective through \"isokratia\" which argues for an extension of liberal democracy with mass electronic voting.\n\n"}

The group is based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and gained a wide profile after instigating a protest in Concordia University, that forced the Israeli ex-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cancel a speech that was to take place on 9 September 2002. \n\nIn 2009, the organization publicly threatened civil disobedience and unrest in response to the Canada Border Services agency barring British MP George Galloway from entry into Canada.\n\nSPHR was established in 1999 as a result of a merger between two student organizations based at Concordia University and McGill University in Montreal; the Concordia Centre for Palestinian Human Rights (CCPHR) and the McGill Palestinian Solidarity Committee (PSC). It was seen by many that the Oslo Agreement did not stop the threats to the Palestinian people as settlements continued unabated and many sought to highlight the plight of the Palestinian people for the Canadian people. \n\nHaving noticed a certain vacuum in the Canadian solidarity movement, the members wanted to create a unique and independent organization which would be able to promote the Palestinian struggle in all of its aspects. It was after a three-month-long discussion that the two boards decided to merge and to consolidate their resources to the furthering of the Palestinian struggle for human rights. The two groups worked on major projects together and consulted each other. \n\nAn effort was made to be open and consultative. Their logic was that they wanted to create an organization which would have enough credibility to be able to appeal to the general public without compromising basic human right principles and facts surrounding the Palestinian plight. The organization invited prominent speakers such as Norman Finkelstein before he became extremely well-known to those concerned with Palestinian human rights. The university administrations sought to block SPHR \nin many cases and make it difficult for the members to exercise their freedom of speech.\n\nIn 2001, following an increase in membership and in activities, founding branches decided to establish a structure in charge of acting as a liaison and resource centre for the various campus branches. This structure was to be formally known as SPHR-National. \n\nThis new structure was given the responsibility to expand and promote the establishment of SPHRs all across Canada. It also received the mandate to act as a lobby and mobilizing group advocating for Palestinian human rights at both the provincial and federal levels. Moreover, SPHR-National acts as a support structure for branches needing help within their university and student union structures.\n\nCurrently, SPHR has branches in 12 university campuses in Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta in the following universities: Concordia University, McGill University, Université de Montréal, UQAM, University of Ottawa, University of Western Ontario, Carleton University, Queen's University, University of Toronto, University of Toronto at Mississauga, McMaster University, University of British Columbia, University of Calgary, and Ryerson University.\n\n\n"}

Its plot follows a 15-year-old student at an elite Beverly Hills academy who accuses her drama teacher of sexual harassment.\n\nKimberly Joyce is a precocious, narcissistic, sociopathic high school student at Roxbury Academy, an elite preparatory school in Beverly Hills. She and her best friend Brittany take Randa, a new Muslim student who recently immigrated from the Middle East, under their wing. Kimberly's home life is troubled; her bigoted and disaffected father Hank, an electronics executive, shows little interest in her life, while her vapid stepmother, Kathy, constantly attempts to reprimand her for her coarse language and attitude. Kimberly dreams of becoming an actress, and obtains a coveted role as Anne Frank in the school play.\n\nThe school drama teacher, Percy Anderson, orders Kimberly and Randa to after-school detention one day for disrupting class, and forces Kimberly to write an essay reflecting on her transgression. Percy takes the essay home that evening and has his wife, Grace, read it aloud provocatively as a role play before the two engage in sex. After Brittany is publicly humiliated by Percy during an acting exercise, Kimberly devises a plan to accuse him of sexually harassing each of them. Unable to afford an attorney, Percy agrees to his friend Roger - a clueless high school law teacher who passed the bar - acting as his attorney. In court, Roger proposes that the accusations are in retaliation to Kimberly having been replaced in the school play after referring to her Jewish classmate Josh's lawyer father as a \"money-grubbing shyster.\"\n\nThe case becomes a media sensation covered extensively by Emily Klein, a local lesbian reporter. Shortly after the trial begins, Kimberly has a sexual encounter with Emily. She manipulates Josh with oral sex into convincing his father Larry, a renowned defense attorney, to defend Percy \"pro bono\". When Larry cross examines Brittany, she confesses on the stand that she, Kimberly, and Randa fabricated the accusations. When Emily confronts her outside the courthouse, Kimberly reveals she filmed their sexual encounter, and uses it as blackmail to receive favorable press coverage.\n\nOverwhelmed with the shame brought on her family by the false accusations, Randa shoots herself to death at school. Grace, now aware the essay Percy had her read was written by Kimberly, leaves him. In the storm of media coverage, Emily extolls Kimberly as a mere \"victim\" of society, and the ensuing press incites Hollywood producers to give Kimberly a bit part on a daytime soap opera.\n\nWhen Brittany visits Kimberly at her house, Kimberly reveals she manipulated Josh into having his father defend Percy as she knew it would cause Brittany to buckle under pressure in court. When Brittany asks why, Kimberly explains that she devised the calculated plot to garner publicity for herself, as well as exact revenge against Brittany for having stolen her ex-boyfriend, Troy. Brittany lambasts her and leaves, vowing never to speak to her again. Kimberly turns on the television and sees herself on the episode of the soap opera. As she watches herself onscreen, tears begin streaming down her face.\n\nThe plot primarily focuses on sexual harassment accusations within a school system, as well as the repercussions of one 15-year-old girl's actions. But the film also makes commentary on many other social issues in contemporary American culture as well, many of them being controversial. Some of the topics that are commented on include racism, ignorance, discrimination, gender identity, homosexuality, intolerance, immigration, teenage behavior, suicide, parenting, deceit, narcissism and fascination with celebrity status and the entertainment industry.\n\nThe musical score was composed by Gilad Benamram. The film deliberately does not feature any popular music songs. Similarly, the wardrobe and props do not feature contemporary branding.\n\n\nRoger Ebert called \"Pretty Persuasion\" \"daring, and well-acted\", but also said that it \"exists uneasily somewhere between comedy and satire.\" Phil Villarreal of the \"Arizona Daily Star\" called the film a \"scathing and hilarious social satire.\" While Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" praised the film: \"An obscene, misanthropic go-for-broke satire, \"Pretty Persuasion\" is so gleefully nasty that the fact that it was even made and released is astonishing. Much of it is also extremely funny. Any satire worth its salt should not be afraid to offend, and \"Pretty Persuasion\" flings mud in all directions with a fearless audacity.\" James Mottram of Channel 4 opined, \"Hovering uncomfortably between comedy and satire, \"Pretty Persuasion\" never quite gets the balance right.\" Carlo Cavagna thought it a \"dark teen comedy that tries way too hard to be a dark teen comedy.\"\n\nThe \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" accused the film of being an \"ugly, cheap attempt at satire\", and \"Slant\" magazine called it \"a pretty unpersuasive lecture\". Adam Vary of \"The Advocate\" called the film \"rife with political incorrectness.\" Critic Armond White deemed the film \"ingenious.\"\n\nThe film has a \"rotten\" 32 percent rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 77 reviews, with an average rating of 4.96/10. The site's consensus reads: \"\"Pretty Persuasion\" aims for high satire but falls short of poignancy by depending on too much black humor, with too little redeeming humanity to provide balance\".\n\n"}

In addition, Smith also enjoyed success on the school's track and field team, once running the 100 meters in 10.5 seconds. Smith also played club soccer for Oakwood Soccer Club, and it was while playing for Oakwood that he was discovered by scouts from Bolton Wanderers; impressed by what they saw, Smith was offered a three-year scholarship contract with Bolton's youth academy.\n\nSmith was named as a Bolton substitute for games against Tottenham Hotspur and Charlton Athletic during the early part of the 2006-07 season. He made his first team debut for Bolton in their League Cup defeat at Charlton Athletic in October 2006, and made his Premier League debut against Manchester United on October 28, 2006, as an 85th-minute substitute for Kevin Davies.\n\nSmith joined Carlisle United on loan in January 2007, making his debut against Doncaster Rovers as a 63rd-minute substitute, replacing Kevin Gall.

When he regained his fitness, he was loaned out to League Two clubs Darlington and Stockport County.\n\nIn May 2008 he was one of a number of young players released by Bolton manager Gary Megson. Afterwards, he signed with Toronto FC.\n\nSmith made his MLS debut on August 17, 2008, as a second-half substitute in a 2–0 loss to the New York Red Bulls. Midway through the 2009 MLS season, Smith expressed his desire to leave Toronto.

He was released by Toronto FC on June 16, 2009.\n\nIn July 2009 he signed a two-year contract with HNK Rijeka of the Croatian Prva Liga. Smith made his debut the same month in Rijeka's match against Luxembourg side FC Differdange 03 in the Europa League qualifying round when he came off the bench.\n\nAfter leaving Rijeka, Johann trained with Kalmar FF of the Swedish Allsvenskan for two weeks. On March 23, 2010, Kalmar FF and Smith agreed to a one-year contract. On May 25, Kalmar FF terminated their contract with Smith, stating that he did not live up to their expectations.\n\nSmith was in talks with Rijnsburgse Boys of the Dutch Topklasse league in February 2011. However, a contract was not offered. Later in 2011, Smith continued to trial around Europe, most notably with German sides SV Wacker Burghausen, Kickers Offenbach and 1. FC Magdeburg.\n\nSmith trialed with the New York Red Bulls in the summer of 2012, but was not offered a contract.\n\nIn September 2012, Smith signed a contract with Finnish club KuPS of the Veikkausliiga until the end of the season, ending Smith's two-year hiatus from professional soccer.\n\nIn 2014, Smith spent time with both Adelaide Raiders and Cumberland United in the NPL South Australia.\n\nOn March 17, 2015, Smith signed with Canadian club FC Edmonton of the North American Soccer League.\n\nSmith was named to the United States squad for the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Canada, but a pre-tournament injury forced his removal from the team.

Twenty-three locomotives were later fitted with radio remote-control, and renumbered in the range 671–693.\n\nIn 2013 there are still two locomotives active daily in The Netherlands. One is active for Railpro in Crailoo and the other is active for LOCON Benelux in Apeldoorn.\n\nThere was also the similar NS Class 500.

NS subsequently placed orders for a further 35 locomotives. There was also an order for 15 locomotives to be delivered without engines that would have an alternative engine fitted in the Netherlands. These were numbered as 451-465 briefly before being renumbered to 701–715.\n\nThis class was withdrawn by NS in the early 2000s.

Parker High School, in Chicago, Illinois. He went to the Merchant Marine Academy and briefly attended University of Illinois at Chicago, before leaving school to pursue his business interests.\n\nIn 1980, Weisman founded role playing game publisher FASA Corporation (short for the Freedonia Aeronautics & Space Administration, named after the fictional country in the Marx Brothers film \"Duck Soup\") with partner L. Ross Babcock. Weisman and Babcock printed up a few hundred copies of Weisman's early adventures for the pen and paper role-playing game, \"Traveller\", and sold them to a local Chicago store before sending them to nationwide distributors. Although working out of Weisman's basement, he and Babcock were looking for outside talent and brought William H. Keith, Jr. and his brother J. Andrew Keith into the company from GDW. The company's first professional publication was \"I.S.P.M.V Tethys\" (1980), a set of deckplans for a mercenary transport, drawn by Weisman and featuring three scenarios written by Andrew Keith. In August 1981, FASA came to an agreement to publish the digest-sized magazine \"High Passage\", on which Weisman and Babcock did the layout and editing. Weisman wanted FASA to produce its own science-fiction roleplaying game, so he and Babcock secured the rights to produce their own 1983 \"\". FASA introduced a game about battling mechanoids called \"Combots\" (1983), by Weisman and Fawcett. FASA later produced the successful \"BattleTech\" and \"Shadowrun\" franchises.\n\nIn 1987, Weisman and his father Morton Weisman founded Environmental Simulations Project — later renamed Virtual Worlds Entertainment —, the company that produced the BattleTech Centers. Working with Incredible Technologies, VWE created the world's first immersive networked location-based virtual reality gaming centers. VWE was a critical, though not a commercial success. As Weisman got more involved in VWE, Sam Lewis became FASA's president.\n\nIn 1995, Weisman founded FASA Interactive with Denny Thorley and Morton Weisman to personally take over the development and production of the hit \"MechWarrior\" PC games; FASA Corporation (the RPG company) provided FASA Interactive with a license for its properties in return for stock. The franchise is one of the top-selling PC games of all time, with sales of over 9 million units worldwide.\n\nOn January 7, 1999, Microsoft acquired Virtual World Entertainment Group and FASA Interactive; VWE was sold off to some of its developers, while FASA Interactive became Microsoft's FASA Studio. Babcock and Weisman went over to Microsoft, with Weisman becoming the Creative Director of Microsoft games from 1999-2002. While working at Microsoft, Weisman and his unit created a new genre of interactive entertainment called alternative reality games, and developed the alternate reality game \"The Beast\", to promote the Steven Spielberg film \"A.I.\"\n\nWeisman had been working on a design for a computer game called \"Corsairs!\", set in an alternate universe United States, and he convinced FASA Corporation to develop the board game \"Crimson Skies\" (1998) to enhance the value of the property.\n\nIn 2000, he founded WizKids, with his new idea for miniatures games involving the \"clix\" miniature figure that contained a dial to depict the miniature's stats. WizKids produced the games \"Mage Knight\", HeroClix, and \"Pirates of the Spanish Main\". WizKids grew rapidly and went from start-up to over $30M in annual sales in just two years. The company focused on miniature figure games that are easy to learn for younger players. Weisman sold WizKids to Topps in 2003.\n\nIn 2003 he founded 42 Entertainment, a design company in the new field of the alternate reality game or ARGs. 42 has created multiple ARGs, including, \"I Love Bees\", to promote the Xbox game \"Halo 2\", and \"Year Zero\" to promote the Nine Inch Nails album of the same name.\n\nIn 2006, his \"Cathy's Book\", a novel with interactive elements co-written by Sean Stewart and illustrated by Cathy Brigg appeared from Running Press. The book was a best seller in Germany and sold over 100,000 copies in the USA.\n\nIn 2007, FASA Studio was dissolved and all of the FASA rights were then licensed to Weisman. In 2007 Weisman founded Smith & Tinker (named after the characters in \"The Wizard of Oz\"). It was through Smith & Tinker that Weisman was able to relicense his old FASA properties. Smith & Tinker has licensed the electronic entertainment rights to Crimson Skies, Shadowrun, MechWarrior and other FASA properties that had belonged to Microsoft.\n\nThe same year Weisman co-founded the start-up Fyreball with Pete Parsons (formerly of Bungie and currently serves on the Board of Advisors along with Ed Fries). The company is now operating under the name Meteor Solutions\n\nOn May 27, 2009 Weisman's Smith & Tinker announced their first game had been released to public beta. Nanovor is an online battle game targeted to 7 - 12 year olds. In support of the game, Smith & Tinker is releasing episodic cartoons, graphic novels, comic books, figurines and more.\n\nOn June 9, 2009 Weisman and J.C. Hutchins released \"Personal Effects: Dark Art\" (Griffin). On the same day Weisman along with Russ Bullock announced that the \"MechWarrior\" franchise would be seeing a relaunch.\n\nJordan is currently an Adjunct Professor in the Interactive Media Division at the USC School of Cinema-Television. In 2012 he started to raise money, through Kickstarter, for \"Shadowrun Returns\", a new video game adaptation of \"Shadowrun\". His new company is Harebrained Schemes and they released their 3rd game Shadowrun Returns in July 25, 2013. Shortly after, on September 10, 2013, Jordan's company launched a Kickstarter for its first tabletop game, \"Golem Arcana\". After successfully funding, \"Golem Arcana\" released the following year on August 13, 2014. On January 13, 2015, Harebrained Schemes launched another Kickstarter campaign to partially fund development their next Shadowrun game, . Shadowrun Returns was in many top 10 lists for 2014 and several No 1s for RPGs that year. Shadowrun Hong Kong was in many top 10s lists in 2015 and several No. 1 RPGs for 2015. In 2015 HBS did a kickstarter for Battletech/MechWarrior another property created by Jordan Weisman. They raised just short of 3 million and the game was released on April 24, 2018.\n\nIn June 2018, it was announced and completed Harebrained's acquisition by Paradox Interactive for a fixed purchase price of US$7,500,000.\n\nWeisman has won more than 100 awards, including election to the Hall of Fame by the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design.

Byers played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for parts of ten seasons with the Boston Bruins and San Jose Sharks, earning a reputation as one of the league's toughest enforcers. He is the cousin of Dane Byers.\n\nBorn in Nipawin, Saskatchewan, Byers spent a year with the Notre Dame Hounds before beginning his major junior career in 1981 with the Regina Pats of the Western Hockey League (WHL). The following year, the Boston Bruins selected him with a second-round pick (39th overall) at the 1982 NHL Entry Draft. His gritty style earned him a spot with Team Canada at the 1984 World Junior Championships in Nyköping, Sweden. Byers showed promise by scoring 32 goals in each of the next two seasons with Regina, but it was his 153 and 154 penalty minutes in each of those seasons that would be a better measure of his future professional career.\n\nJoining the Bruins at the end of the 1983–84 season, he scored two goals and four assists for six points while amassing 32 PIMs. Bouncing back and forth between the parent club and the minors, his best statistical season came in 1987–88, when he registered 10 goals and 14 assists for 24 points while amassing 249 penalty minutes in 53 games.\n\nByers signed as a free-agent with the San Jose Sharks on November 7, 1992, where he finished his NHL career in 1992–93, before ending his professional playing career with the International Hockey League (IHL)'s Minnesota Moose in 1994–1995. He scored 28 goals and 43 assists for 71 points and amassed 1,081 PIMs in 279 NHL games over ten seasons.\n\nShortly after his playing career, Byers returned to the Boston area and became a member of the \"Hill Man Morning Show\" on radio station WAAF-FM, where he was an on air personality and sports specialist for 23 years before the show ended. Byers moved to the afternoon slot along with Co-host Mike Hsu. On September 3, 2019 Buyers unexpectedly quit the Hsu & LB show in a tearful goodbye that he gave on the air seconds before walking out of the studio.\n\nByers has made several appearances on the FX dramedy \"Rescue Me\" with well-known Bruins fan Denis Leary, as well as fellow former Bruins Cam Neely and Phil Esposito. He had a cameo appearance in the films \"Shallow Hal\" and \"Stuck On You\" as well. He was also featured on the Season One finale of \"Bar Rescue\" on Spike TV. Byers and Neely also appeared in the music video for the song Hole Hearted by Boston hard rock group Extreme.\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 21, 1997. Bart accidentally ruins Christmas for the Simpson family by burning down the tree and all their presents.\n\nIt was written by Ron Hauge, directed by Bob Anderson, and guest starred Alex Trebek as himself. Hauge was inspired to write the episode after learning of an orphanage that had been ripped off. The episode was included, among other Christmas themed episodes of the series, on a 2005 Christmas special boxed set on DVD.\n\nHomer and Marge go Christmas shopping at a Try-N-Save megastore, where frenzied shoppers are snatching the holiday season's most popular toys. Homer, posing as a store cashier, buys toys that customers tried to buy from him.\n\nAt bedtime on Christmas Eve, the family makes last-minute preparations at home, Marge tells everyone that no one can open their presents until 7 AM the next morning and confiscates all of the alarm clocks. However, Bart drinks 12 glasses of water to wake up early and unwrap his gifts, one of which is a remote-controlled fire truck. He plays with it until it sprays water on an overloaded electrical socket, causing a fire that engulfs and melts the plastic Christmas tree and all of the presents beneath it. Bart hides the evidence beneath the snow in the front yard.\n\nWhen the family comes downstairs to find the tree and presents gone, Bart makes up a story about how he caught a burglar taking off with their tree and presents. The police investigate and Kent Brockman does a human interest story on the case.\n\nAs a result of the report, everyone in Springfield gives them a new Christmas tree and $15,000. With the donations, Homer buys a new car. Driving it home, Homer gets stuck behind The Plow King and impatiently passes it. He drives the car onto a frozen lake, forcing everyone to jump out. The ice cracks, causing the car to sink and blow up.\n\nThe next morning, a guilt-ridden Bart admits the truth to his family. Though furious, they go along with the lie when Brockman and his news crew arrive to do a follow-up story. When a cameraman, with help from Santa's Little Helper, finds the tree's remains, the family is forced to explain the truth; Springfield's citizens, feeling scammed, shun them in public and mail them angry letters demanding they pay back the $15,000.\n\nAfter a failed attempt by Marge to win the money on the game show \"Jeopardy!\", the Simpsons arrive home to find everyone in Springfield gathered on their lawn and Marge thinks they have forgiven them. However, while that is the case, they steal all of their belongings, including Santa's Little Helper and Snowball ll, to cover the $15,000 debt. The family playfully fight over a tattered washcloth, the only thing they have left.\n\nWriter Ron Hauge said he got the idea for the episode one day when he was heading to work. He was listening to the radio and heard of an orphanage getting ripped off, and they were getting back more than they gave. The spectators in the stands during Bart's dreams are various animators.\n\nWhen Krusty says \"15,000 Missoulians\" it is a reference to Ron Hauge having lived in Missoula, Montana. When the Simpsons' car says \"I'll Keell you\", this is a reference to a Wiffleball bat in the writer's office that said that.\n\nThe episode has several references to Christmas films. The title is a play on \"Miracle on 34th Street\" while the scene where everyone rallies around to support the Simpsons is reminiscent of the last scene of the classic holiday movie \"It's a Wonderful Life\". The film is further spoofed when Homer tells Lisa to stop playing the piano which parodies a similar scene involving George Bailey.\n\n\"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" is also parodied when the senior citizens are dancing at the Springfield Retirement Castle—their dancing is based on the way the Peanuts characters dance. Marge appears as a contestant on \"Jeopardy!\" with host Alex Trebek guest starring. One of the stuffed animals Chief Wiggum is carrying is Binky from Matt Groening's comic strip \"Life in Hell\".\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Miracle on Evergreen Terrace\" finished 23rd in ratings for the week of December 15–21, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 9.8, equivalent to approximately 9.6 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"King of the Hill\".\n\nThe episode received mixed to positive reviews from critics.\n\nThe authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\" said \"A deliberately mawkish Christmas episode that is low on good jokes (although the Simpsons watching their own fire on television is a good start) and a retread of any number of episodes where Bart does wrong, feels guilty and eventually has to fess up. The only real ray of sunshine is the closing moments when the neighbours get their revenge but the Simpsons find the family spirit after all.\"\n\nIn its review of a 2005 DVD boxed set of Christmas themed episodes of \"The Simpsons\", \"The Journal\" described \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\", \"Miracle On Evergreen Terrace\", \"Skinner's Sense of Snow\", and \"Dude, Where's My Ranch?\" among memorable episodes of the series.\n\nIn his review of the same DVD, Digitally Obsessed critic Joel Cunningham wrote that \"Miracle on Evergreen Terrace\" is \"a good one [...] A nice combo of humor, satire, and heartwarming holiday fuzzies\". Andy Dougan wrote in \"Evening Times\" that the episode is \"one of the darkest, blackest Christmas cartoons ever animated\".\n\n"}

His eldest brother, Ervin Drake, born Ervin Maurice Druckman, and the middle brother, Milton, both became notable songwriters. His family was Jewish.\n\nAt age 12, Drake contracted scarlet fever, confining him to bed for a year, a time he spent drawing his own comic strip creations. Years later, turning to writing, he studied journalism at the University of Missouri and later at New York University.\n\nCollaborating with co-writer Leslie Waller (together using the pseudonym Drake Waller) and artist Matt Baker, Drake wrote St. John Publications' pioneering \"It Rhymes with Lust\", a proto-graphic novel comics magazine sold on newsstands in 1950. At some unspecified point before or after this, he met a neighbor of one of his brothers: Bob Kane, the credited creator of Batman for one of DC Comics' precursor companies. After collaborating with Drake on some projects, Kane introduced Drake to editors at DC.\n\nComic books during this time did not routinely list creator credits; historians have, however, pinpointed Drake's first DC work as the first seven pages of the eight-page Batman story \"The Return of Mister Future\" in \"Batman\" #98 (March 1956). Soon, Drake was scripting stories across a variety of genres for DC, from adventure drama (\"Fireman Farrell\" in \"Showcase\" #1, April 1956) to humor (1960s stories for the company's Bob Hope and Jerry Lewis comics) to mystery and supernatural fiction (the anthology series \"House of Mystery\") to science fiction (the feature \"Tommy Tomorrow\" in \"World's Finest Comics\" #102, June 1959, and elsewhere, and the feature \"Space Ranger\" in several issues of \"Tales of the Unexpected\", to give a sampling).\n\nIn 1962, Drake and his friend, Bob Haney discovered the product of a small company distributed by National Periodical Publications' Independent News, Marvel Comics, and were impressed by its bold new quality. However, when the pair confronted National's publisher, Irwin Donenfeld, about the new competition, they were frustrated by his curt dismissal of the rival, citing their current large revenues.\n\nIn 1963, as Drake had warned, Marvel's increasingly profitable circulation increased enough to force Independent News to allow it to publish more titles. Meanwhile, editor Murray Boltinoff asked Drake to develop a feature to run in the anthology series \"My Greatest Adventure\". Given the assignment on a Friday with a script due that Tuesday, and inspired to emulate Marvel's idea for superheroes with more character depth, Drake conceived of what would become the superhero team the Doom Patrol, and turned to another DC writer, Bob Haney, to co-plot and co-script the first adventure. Artist Bruno Premiani designed the characters. Drake would subsequently script every Doom Patrol story, with Premiani drawing virtually all, from the team's debut in \"My Greatest Adventure\" #80 (June 1963) through the series retitling to \"The Doom Patrol\" with issue #86 (March 1964), to the final issue of its initial run, #121 (Oct. 1968). Drake and Bob Brown introduced Beast Boy in \"Doom Patrol\" #99 (Nov. 1965).\n\nMeanwhile, Drake noticed that Marvel Comics published a series of their own, \"The Uncanny X-Men\", barely a few months later that seemed to mirror his own series' concepts in many respects. These included the concept of a wheelchair-bound mentor leading a team of outcast superheroes who often clashed with a team of villains called the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants that seemed too close to \"The Doom Patrol\"'s own enemies, the Brotherhood of Evil. However, Drake found no support for his complaints from National's editorial staff until Drake was forced to concede at that time that it could have been a coincidence.\n\nPremiani and Boltinoff appeared as themselves in the final story, discussing the impending demise of the team, but Drake, who had included himself in the script as well, did not. In 1981, Drake said that DC publisher Irwin Donenfeld had ordered him removed from the story because Drake by then had left to work at rival Marvel Comics, following a dispute with Donenfeld over Drake's DC page rate. Drake said he consented to complete the script because of his friendship with Boltinoff. Comics historian Mark Evanier believes that, additionally, Drake, among others, was \"ousted\" for being \"a loud voice in a writers' revolt during which several of the firm's longtime freelancers were demanding health insurance, reprint fees, and better pay.\"\n\nBy this time, Drake and artist Win Mortimer had co-created DC's \"Stanley and His Monster\", a whimsical feature about a 6-year-old boy and his large, tusked, pink-furred and hardly ferocious \"pet\", which debuted in the funny animal comic \"The Fox and the Crow\" #95 (Jan. 1966). One comics historian hailed the feature as a precursor of Bill Watterson's comic strip \"Calvin & Hobbes\", \"where a boy keeps company with a marvelous being, the very existence of which is unknown by any of his more worldly associates. Its most direct antecedent in comics is probably Crockett Johnson's \"Barnaby\", where parents repeatedly interact with their son's supernatural friend even while denying the possibility of that being's existence.\" Drake wrote the revival of the Quality Comics character Plastic Man in 1966. He wrote several stories for \"The Adventures of Jerry Lewis\" including issue #101 (July–Aug. 1967) which featured artist Neal Adams' first full-length story for DC.\n\nWith artist Carmine Infantino, Drake had co-created Deadman, a murdered circus trapeze artist whose ghost traverses the country seeking the unknown man who killed him. Deadman's first appearance in \"Strange Adventures\" #205 included the first known depiction of narcotics in a story approved by the Comics Code Authority. Drake additionally scripted the following issue's story, miscredited in several reprints as written by Jack Miller. The character would become a mainstay of the DC Universe well into the 2000s.\n\nOther work for DC during this time included stories of the adventuring quartet the Challengers of the Unknown.\n\nLetterer Clem Robins, who worked with him, wrote that Drake\nIn the late 1960s, Drake freelanced for Marvel Comics, beginning with \"Captain Savage\" #5 (Aug. 1968), starring a World War II Marines squadron; he would additionally script some later issues of that series, plus a single issue of the WWII series \"Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos\". Drake wrote the run of \"X-Men\" #47–54 (Aug. 1968 – March 1969, co-writing his initial issue with Gary Friedrich), which included two rare circumstances of stories drawn but not written by the noted comics writer-artist Jim Steranko. Drake introduced several new characters to the series including Mesmero, Lorna Dane, and Havok. Drake as well wrote issues of the space-alien superhero \"Captain Marvel\", stories for the superhero satire comic \"Not Brand Echh\", and a story of the jungle lord Ka-Zar. In \"Marvel Super-Heroes\" #18 (Jan. 1969), Drake and editor Stan Lee co-created the Guardians of the Galaxy, a far-future team of freedom-fighters gathered from different planets of our solar system. The characters would star in a 62-issue series in the 1990s, and inspire a new team of that name in the 2000s.\n\nBy mid-1969, however, Drake had left Marvel. His next new comics work to be published was a supernatural anthology story in Gold Key Comics' \"Grimm's Ghost Stories\" #1 (Jan. 1972) – the first of many stories for that company, including for the series \"Boris Karloff Tales of Mystery\", and the licensed TV-series titles \"Dark Shadows\", \"Star Trek,\" and \"Twilight Zone\", among others. His Gold Key work included what comics historian Mark Evanier called \"a particularly long and delightful stint on \"Little Lulu\"\", beginning with issue #232 (May 1976). In 1973, Drake began freelancing again for DC occasionally, writing stories for series as varied as \"Weird War Tales\" and \"Supergirl\". Beginning in 1977, Drake contributed stories to several issues of Charlton Comics' black-and-white satirical-humor magazine, \"Sick\".\n\nDrake contributed to all four issues of \"Starstream\", a 68-page anthology series with cardboard covers that adapted classic science-fiction stories. That series was published by Whitman Comics, the rights-holder to several properties it licensed to Gold Key, and Drake would continue with Whitman when it began distributing \"Little Lulu\" and its other properties itself in 1980. By 1981, Drake was executive director of the Veteran's Bedside Network, an organization through which actors, actresses, and sound engineers would perform scripted material to entertain patients in Veterans Administration hospitals in the New York City area.\n\nDrake's last known original comics story for nearly 20 years was the six-page \"G.I. Samurai\" in DC's \"G.I. Combat\" #276 (April 1985). He resurfaced two decades later with the 12-page \"Tripping Out!\", illustrated by Luis Dominguez, in the mature-audience comics magazine \"Heavy Metal\" vol. 26, #6 (Jan. 2003). This story was accompanied by a one-page biography of the two creators.\n\nDrake wrote the foreword, introduction, preface and afterword of DC's 2002 hardcover reprint collection \"The Doom Patrol Archives\" #1. He was also working on a new Doom Patrol graphic novel, a prequel story, at the time of his death. He also wrote a five-page afterword, \"The Graphic Novel – And How It Grew\", in Dark Horse Books' March 2007 reprint of his and collaborators Leslie Waller and Matt Baker's pioneering, 1950 proto-graphic novel \"It Rhymes with Lust\".\n\nDrake collapsed days after having attended the February 23–25, 2007 New York Comic Book Convention, where he had had, organizers said, \"a touch of pneumonia\". Admitted to New York City's Cabrini Medical Center, he died of pneumonia and septic shock.\n\nDrake received several awards for his comics work, including the 1967 Alley Award for Best Full-Length Story (\"Who's Been Lying in My Grave?\" in \"Strange Adventures\" #205 with Carmine Infantino), the 1967 Alley Award for Best New Strip (\"Deadman\" with Carmine Infantino in \"Strange Adventures\"), and a 1999 Inkpot Award.\n\nIn 2005, Drake received the first annual Bill Finger Award for Excellence in Comics Writing. In 2008, he was posthumously inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame.\n\nDrake wrote the screenplay for the 1964 horror film \"The Flesh Eaters\", which he produced. He wrote the screenplay for \"Who Killed Teddy Bear\", a 1966 release starring Sal Mineo and Juliet Prowse, as well as the title song for the 1970 film \"Ils sont nus\" ('\"We Are All Naked\").\n\nDrake wrote lyrics for musicals, co-writing the book for \"G&S: or, The Oils of Araby\" (1980), with his brother, songwriter-composer Ervin Drake. \n\n\n \n"}

The operation was taken over by Ron Murray in 1970 by which time it was operating services to Captains Flat, Kowen Forest, Naas, Tidbinbilla, Uriarra and Williamsdale with 10 buses. Murrays were operating seven school buses when the services were taken over by Deane's Buslines in November 1997.\n\nAt some point Murrays diversified into coach operation, initially to the Snowy Mountains. By the mid-1980s Murrays were operating interstate services from Canberra to Sydney, Wollongong and Narooma. These services continue today.\n\nIn May 1979, Murrays purchased Sydney bus routes 6 Arncliffe to Earlwood and 49 Carlton to Rockdale. These were sold in October 1982 to Brighton Bus Lines after the laws requiring tourist vehicle licences to be attached to route service operators were relaxed.\n\nIn late 1988, an operation commenced on the Gold Coast followed in 1989 by Melbourne.\n\nMurrays expanded rapidly in the early 1990s, capitalising on the growth of inbound tourism and the departure of some of its rivals. In May 1998 the Koala Tours business in Sydney was purchased.\n\nIn May 2015, Murrays commenced operating a service in Queensland from Miles to Brisbane Airport.\n\nMurrays initial coach fleet was built up with ex Ansett Pioneer GMC PD4107s and Mercedes-Benz O302 and O303s. In the mid 1980s Murrays purchased a number of new Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and Austral coaches.\n\nFollowing the collapse of Deluxe Coachlines and Sunliner Express amongst others, Murrays was able to renew its fleet with large numbers of near-new Austral, Denning and Scania coaches. In the mid-1990s it took delivery of 120 PMC Australia bodied MANs and Scanias.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2011, Murrays conducted a major fleet renewal purchasing over 60 BCI coaches. As at January 2020, the fleet consisted of 199 vehicles.\n\nUntil the early 1990s, Murrays had a livery of three greens and black when a new livery of white with green signwriting was adopted.\n\n"}

The station is owned by West Palm Beach, Florida-based Ion Media Networks (the former Paxson Communications). KPXD's offices are located on Six Flags Drive in Arlington, and its transmitter is located on Belt Line Road in Cedar Hill.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on December 21, 1996 as KINZ-TV (in reference to its original affiliation with the Infomail TV Network (InTV), the predecessor-of-sorts of Ion Television), carrying infomercials for much of its schedule and programming from religious broadcaster The Worship Network during the overnight hours. The station was to have originally given the call letters KAQV in its construction permit to operate the station, which were changed prior to its sign-on. In early 1998, Paxson Communications (the forerunner to Ion Media Networks) bought the station, and changed its call letters to KPXD-TV on January 13; the station became a charter owned-and-operated station of Paxson's new family-oriented broadcast network Pax TV (now Ion Television) when the network launched on August 31, 1998.\nAs part of a wide-ranging deal that gave NBC partial ownership of Pax, the former network's owned-and-operated stations as well as many of its affiliates provided sales and marketing assistance for Pax TV stations in several markets, with KPXD entering into a joint sales agreement with KXAS-TV (channel 5; which NBC had owned 76% interest in at the time, it is now owned by the network outright).\n\nIn 2003, Pax TV decided to scale back its programming due to financial losses, resulting in much of the afternoon timeslots on its stations' schedules being filled with infomercials. After Pax was rebranded as i: Independent Television on June 30, 2005, Worship Network programming moved to one of KPXD's digital subchannels (originally its third subchannel, then to its fourth subchannel after Ion Life and Qubo launched, before Worship was dropped on January 31, 2010).\n\nKPXD-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 68, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 42, using PSIP to display KPXD-TV's virtual channel as 68 on digital television receivers, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition.\n\nIn September 2001, as part of the JSA with that station, KPXD began airing tape delayed rebroadcasts of NBC station KXAS-TV's 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. newscasts each Monday through Friday evening at 6:30 and 10:30 p.m. (the latter beginning shortly before that program's live broadcast ended on KXAS). The news rebroadcasts ended in 2003, two years before most of the network's other news share agreements with Pax TV stations were terminated upon the network's rebranding as i: Independent Television, as a result of the network's financial troubles.\n\n"}

The company is based in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. Totes is regularly billed in press reports as \"the world's largest marketer of umbrellas\". The company has divisions in the United States, Canada, UK, and France.\n\nThe company sells products under \"totes\", \"ISOTONER\", and \"ESNY\" brands. Totes branded products include umbrellas, rubber footwear, ponchos, rain hats, and travel bags. Several licensed gift and boot products also carry the totes brand name. Mostly known for private label footwear, ESNY, now part of Totes Isotoner, is associated with branded products such as flip-flops, sandals, and ESNY Occasions wedding footwear. Totes Isotoner and ESNY branded products are carried by most national retailers in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Totes Isotoner itself has several sub-brands, including Cirrus, SolBounce, Zenz and Toasties.\n\nTotes Isotoner traces its roots back to the Roll-O-Radio Company, a mail-order radio kit supplier, which was incorporated in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1924. In 1931, Roll-O-Radio Co. became \"Perfect Manufacturing Company (Inc.)\", whose So-Lo Works in Oakley, Ohio developed a popular shoe-resoling product. Perfect Manufacturing Company moved to Loveland, Ohio in 1942 with a name change to \"So-Lo Works, Incorporated\". From the mid-1940s to the late 1950s, company president Joe J. Marx designed, manufactured and marketed his successful \"totes\" line of foldable waterproof apparel, starting with \"totes\" women's slip-on overshoes for rainy days and culminating in Skooba-\"totes\" full-length dry exposure suits for diving and water-skiing. Bradford E. Phillips purchased So-Lo Works Inc. in 1961, renamed the company \"Totes Incorporated\" in 1965 and included \"totes\" collapsible umbrellas in the firm's repertoire in 1970, By the mid-1980s, Totes Inc. had become the world's largest supplier of such umbrellas. In 1994, Phillips sold Totes Inc. to Boston investment firm Bain Capital.\n\nIn 1997, Totes Inc. merged with ARIS»ISOTONER Incorporated, a producer of leather gloves. Aris Isotoner traced its roots to 1918, when French glovemaker Paul Chanut and American glove reseller Larry Stanton founded the Aris Glove Company, developing the first stretchable nylon/elastane glove with leather coverings and naming their design \"ISOTONER\" (a portmanteau of \"isometric\" and \"toning\") to highlight the glove's selling points. The American Sara Lee Corporation purchased Aris in 1974, changing the firm's name to Aris Isotoner. After the 1997 merger, the successor company was named \"Totes Isotoner Corporation\" to showcase the respective flagship products of Totes Inc. and Aris Isotoner. In 2001, Bain Capital sold Totes Isotoner to private equity fund Swander Pace Capital, which resold it in 2007 to MidOcean Partners. In 2014, Totes Isotoner was acquired by Investcorp and Freeman Spogli & Co. Thus far in the new millennium, Totes Isotoner has increased its product range, overseas presence and monetary value.\n9 April 1924 sees the incorporation of Roll-O-Radio Co. as a new business in Cincinnati, Ohio, with premises on Pearl and Race Streets in 1925 and on Third and Sycamore Streets from 1926 to 1930. As its name suggests, the company specialises in selling radio kits, including crystal sets and power supplies.\nOn 1 June 1931, Roll-O-Radio Co. changes its name by charter amendment to \"Perfect Manufacturing Company (Inc.)\". After their Marx-Flarsheim advertising agency merges with the Archer Company in Cincinnati, president Joe J. Marx and treasurer Henry B. Flarsheim enter the manufacturing business with Roland R. Bollman of the Perfect Manufacturing Company in Cincinnati. Both Flarsheim and Bollman retire in 1935, when Marx, president, purchases the entire stock of the Perfect Manufacturing Company, now based in Oakley, Ohio. The firm’s So-Lo Works division makes a rubber salve for resoling worn-out shoes during the Great Depression. The advertising slogan “Millions now use SO-LO to fix shoes for as low as 1¢ a repair” hints at the name’s possible origin.\nIn 1941, the So-Lo Works division acquires a one-storey factory building at Twightwee near the Little Miami River in Loveland, Ohio, from the former occupant, the George E. Smith Company, candy manufacturer. 1 June 1943 sees a change of name by charter amendment to \"So-Lo Works, Incorporated\". During the Second World War, the US Government contracts So-Lo Works to manufacture military supplies including shoe dubbing and canned food in the new premises. The firm continues to serve the country’s civilian population through output of “make-do and mend” household repair products. So-Lo Works boosts morale and productivity by engaging all workers in management decision-making and by developing welfare and recreational facilities.\n\nAfter the Allied victory in 1945, So-Lo Works quickly reconverts to civilian production with a reduced workforce. By a change in patterns, rubber protectors for anti-aircraft gun handles convert to women’s slip-on overshoes. In 1949, this very line leads to the development of tough, lightweight, foldable, stretchy latex-rubber overshoes called “totes” (slogan: “tote ‘em in your pocket”). So-Lo “totes” soon lead a market previously dominated by the major rubber manufacturers’ bulkier winter boots. Between 1945 and 1954, the firm’s prototypes earn six patents and registered designs. Ever the showman, company president Marx promotes his “totes” at any sales opportunity. In 1949, reportedly, the company makes 24,000 pairs per week and cannot fulfil all its orders.\n\nIn 1950, So-Lo Works Incorporated vice-president Fred R. Heckman dies and the firm’s name changes to So-Lo Marx Rubber Co. of Loveland, Ohio. Later the same year, the company invites parents to submit snapshots of their children putting on their \"totes\" for use in national advertising. During the 1950s, the \"totes\" product family expands. The \"world’s lightest\" Hip-\"totes\" thigh-length fishing waders appear in 1955, while 1956 sees the introduction of Trouser-\"totes\", tough lightweight leggings for deer hunters. The firm markets the \"world’s finest\" Skooba-\"totes\" dry suits a year after a high-school student and a sporting-goods sales clerk trial the prototypes in the nearby Little Miami River early in 1957. Divers and water skiers alike welcome these low-cost full-length seamless exposure suits, which enable them to operate all year round.\nIn the early 1960s, Skooba-“totes” dry suits not only prove popular across the USA with divers, water skiers and now cavers, but also find favour with their counterparts in Australia, Canada, England, Finland and France. In November 1961, Bradford E. Phillips, a Western Felt Works sales representative for industrial rubber and textiles, acquires 100% of So-Lo Marx’s outstanding capital stock. He continues as the sole stockholder until June 1994. Marx remains on the board until he retires to Sarasota, Florida, where he passes away, aged 70, in December 1967.\n\n1 April 1965 sees So-Lo Marx Rubber Co. change by charter amendment to \"Totes Incorporated\". Company president Brad Phillips’s choice of name confirms his intention to refocus on the original lucrative \"Totes\" product of the late 1940s and early 1950s: lightweight rubber footwear that packs up into a small pouch when not in use. Other So-Lo Marx product lines — diving suits, rubber cement, resoling material, meat tenderiser, bicycle seats, instant gravy, plaster statuette moulds — face imminent cancellation.\nIn 1970, Phillips adds a collapsible umbrella to the Totes range of wet-weather gear, whose selling point is the ability to fold out of sight when no longer required. Having failed twice to devise his own working prototype, he discovers that L.P. Henryson & Co. Inc. of New York has created a successful design and he buys the company to obtain its 1968 patent. Totes is now on course to become the world’s largest manufacturer of such umbrellas. On 28 February 1972, Totes Incorporated files agreement of merger with Eastman Products Corporation, Marx Pure Foods Inc. and L.P. Henryson Company Inc. In 1975, Phillips introduces a water-repellent hat after considering the time has come again for men's headgear, finding less success later, however, with his stainproof ties.\nIn 1983, Phillips secures US patent 454275 for an \"umbrella with advertising flag\", which acknowledges the pre-existence of the 1968 Henryson Co. collapsible umbrella patent. In 1986, Totes Inc. is reported to be the largest umbrella seller in the USA with over half the company's revenue coming from umbrella sales. Totes' umbrella production is outsourced to Taiwan, one of the world's major umbrella-making centres. In 1987, the airline TWA enables passengers to purchase Totes umbrellas when they are on international flights. In 1988, one-size-fits-all Totes \"Toasties\", \"cosy slipper socks to wear on those cold winter nights\", go on sale.\nIn 1994, Bain Capital acquires Totes. Three years later, in 1997, the totes ISOTONER corporation is formed from the merger of Totes corporation and ARIS»ISOTONER Incorporated, a producer of leather gloves.\n\nAris Isotoner dates back to 1918, when French glovemaker Paul Chanut and American glove reseller Larry Stanton found the Aris Glove Company. They develop the first stretchable nylon/elastane (glove) with leather coverings. They name it ISOTONER (combining the terms \"isometric\" and \"toning\") to reflect the stretchability and comfortable fit of this commercially successful glove. After being purchased by the American Sara Lee Corporation in 1974, Aris changes its name to Aris Isotoner.\n\nSo the \"Totes\" and the \"Isotoner\" in the company name reference both merged firms' flagship products. The change of name from \"Totes Incorporated\" to \"Totes Isotoner Corporation\" is registered on 1 August 1997. By late 1998, Totes Isotoner has a new headquarters in West Chester and a website at totes.com.\n\nIn July 2001, Bain Capital completes sale of Totes Isotoner to San Francisco private equity fund Swander Pace Capital. In December 2001, the company is reported to have \"gone global\" with \"about 1000 employees\" and \"offices in New York, Toronto, London, Paris and Hong Kong\". In 2006, Totes Isotoner buys ESNY, the casual footwear division of New York-based E.S. Originals Inc., whose particular product focus is fashion flip-flops and canvas shoes. MidOcean Partners, a New York based private equity firm targeting investments in the middle market, acquires Totes Isotoner in January 2007 in a $288 million deal. MidOcean helps the company to expand its product offerings globally completing five acquisitions, including Northern Cap and Glove, Acorn Products, Manzella, Just Sheepskin and Grandoe.\n\nIn 2014, MidOcean agrees to sell Totes Isotoner to Investcorp and Freeman Spogli & Co. The deal values Totes Isotoner at between $500 million and $600 million. Freeman Spogli fully exits its investment in Totes in 2019. In April 2019, Totes Isotoner registers the trademark \"Totes Cirrus\" for the purpose of launching in the final months of the year a lightweight and virtually compression-proof rainboot billed as \"tough as boots, light as clouds\" and using proprietary Everywear™ compound technology. In February 2020, Totes Isotoner uses the same technology to market \"Sol Bounce\" flip flops, slides and water shoes. The Everywear™ technology is also built in a new comfort footwear line from Isotoner, \"Zenz,\" offering incredible comfort and lightness in a slip-on \"you'll never want to take off.\" By 2020, totes UK confirms their bid to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future, launching with a range of vegan slippers.\n\n\n\n"}

This is the opposite of a stative verb.\n\nActions denoted by dynamic verbs have duration. They occur over a span of time. This time span may or may not have a defined endpoint, and may or may not yet have occurred. These distinctions lead to various forms related to tense and aspect. For example, a dynamic verb may be said to have a durative aspect if there is not a defined endpoint or a punctual aspect if there is a defined endpoint.\n\nExamples of dynamic verbs in English are 'to run', 'to hit', 'to intervene', 'to savour' and 'to go'.\n\nA striking feature of modern English is its limited use of the simple present tense of dynamic verbs. Generally, the Continuous tense is required to express an action taking place in the present (I am going). The simple present usually refers to a habitual action (I go every day), a general rule (water runs downhill), a future action in some subordinate clauses (if I go) or the historical present (President signs bill). In other Germanic languages a progressive aspect of a dynamic verb is often not marked; for example, English 'I am going home' in German is simply \"Ich gehe nach Hause\", using the present indicative.\n\nA dynamic verb expresses a wide range of actions that may be physical (to run), mental (to ponder), or perceptual (to see), as opposed to a stative verb, which purely expresses a state in which there is no obvious action (to stand, believe, suppose etc.).\n\nDynamic verbs of the Austronesian language Mayrinax Atayal, spoken in Taiwan, are marked morphologically by specific affixes. Stative verbs in Mayrinax Atayal are marked by the prefixes /ma-/ and /∅-/, whereas the dynamic verbs are marked by the affixes /m-/ and /-um-/, as well as /ma-/ and /∅-/.\n\n"}

The stage is also commonly known as an alley or corridor stage.\n\nIn some traverse stages, one end of the stage space may also end in audience, making it similar to a thrust or three-quarter round stage. Other times, the ends of the stage are much larger than the traverse stage itself allowing for more space for actors, sets, and scenery. Although not commonly used for the production of plays, this form of staging is especially popular for catwalks.\n\nThere are many practical implications for the actor performing on a traverse stage, such as the need for greater projection of voice (when the actor faces one audience, he turns his back to the other) and to make sure that every action is visible to both sides of the audience. From a design perspective, staging is very limited so as not to block sight lines across the stage. This means that audiences on either side get two perspectives and might experience very different shows. Furthermore, lighting the stage from one side only will cast a shadow over the actors' faces when viewed from the opposite side.\n\nAn advantage of this style of staging is that it is intimate staging and allows the actors to use the audience for effect.\n\nWhile hanamichi of a kabuki stage is basically a wide catwalk that extended outward from the main stage to the rear, can be compared to one.\n"}

The family arrived at New York on July 5, 1923 on the boat SS \"Homeric\". Between 1924 and 1932 he studied graphic arts/photography and music (viola and composition) at the Settlement Music School and solfeggio with a professor from the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After being awarded an art scholarship for his talents, he attended the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (PAFA) where, from 1928 until 1932, he studied illustration and continued his musical training. While there, Delano was awarded the Cresson Traveling Scholarship, on which he chose to travel to Europe, where he bought a camera that got him interested in photography.\n\nAfter graduating from the PAFA, Delano proposed a photographic project to the Federal Art Project: a study of mining conditions in the Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania anthracite coal area. Delano sent sample pictures to Roy Stryker and applied for a job at the Farm Security Administration Photography program FSA. Through the help of Edwin Rosskam and Marion Post Wolcott, Stryker offered Delano a job at $2,300/year. As a condition of the job, Delano had to have his own car and driver's license, both of which he acquired before moving to Washington, D.C.\n\nBefore working at the FSA, Delano had done his own processing and developing but did neither at the FSA. Other photographers working for the FSA include Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, and Gordon Parks. In 1943 FSA was eliminated as \"budget waste\" and subsumed into the Office of War Information (OWI).\n\nHe travelled to Puerto Rico in 1941 as a part of the FSA project. This trip had such a profound influence on him that he settled there permanently in 1946. Between 1943 and 1946 he served in the U.S. Army Air Forces.\n\nWith his wife Irene (a second cousin to fellow photographer Ben Shahn) he worked in the Community Division of the Department of Public Education producing films, for many of which Delano composed the score. Delano also directed \"Los Peloteros\", a Puerto Rican film about poor rural kids and their love for baseball. The film remains a classic in Puerto Rican cinema.\n\nJack Delano's musical compositions included works of every type: orchestral (many composed for the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra), ballets (composed for Ballet Infantil de Gilda Navarra and Ballets de San Juan), chamber, choral (including \"Pétalo de rosa\", a commission for Coro de Niños de San Juan) and solo vocal. His vocal music often showcases Puerto Rican poetry, especially the words of friend and collaborator Tomás Blanco. Blanco, Délano and his wife Irene collaborated on children's books. The most prominent of these remains a classic in Puerto Rican literature: \"\" by Tomás Blanco, with illustrations by Irene Delano and incidental music (written on the margins) by Jack Delano.\n\nHis score for the film \"Desde las nubes\" demonstrates an early use of electronic techniques. Most of his works composed after he moved to Puerto Rico are notable for using folk material in a classical form.\n\nIn 1957, Delano helped found Puerto Rico's first publicly funded educational television station, WIPR where he also acted as a station producer, composer, and program director.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2322412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322412", "title": "Ninkasi", "text": "Ninkasi\n\nNinkasi is the tutelary goddess of beer in ancient Sumerian religious mythology.\n\nHer father was the King of Uruk, and her mother was the high priestess of the temple of Inanna, the goddess of procreation. She is also one of the eight children created in order to heal one of the eight wounds that Enki receives. Furthermore, she is the goddess of alcohol. She was also born of \"sparkling fresh water\" . She is the goddess made to \"satisfy the desire\" and \"sate the heart.\" She would prepare the beverage daily.\n\nThe Sumerian written language and the associated clay tablets are among the earliest human writings. Scholarly works from the early 1800s onward have developed some facility translating the various Sumerian documents. Among these is a poem with the English title, \"A Hymn to Ninkasi\". . The poem is a recipe for brewing beer. It can be argued that the art of brewing is broken down and explained in order to be passed down from generation to generation. Furthermore, the Hymn to Ninkasi is the oldest record of a direct correlation between the importance of brewing, and the responsibility that women had with regard to supplying both bread and beer to the household. Ninkasi is female, and the fact that a female deity was invoked in prayer with regards to the production of brewed beverages illustrated the relationship between brewing and women as a domestic right and responsibility. The repetitive nature suggests that it was used as a tool in order to pass down information as a way of learning. The poem, from circa 1800 BC, explains that grain was converted into \"bappir\" bread before fermentation, and grapes as well as honey were added to the mix.

{"id": "2322417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322417", "title": "Golden Balls", "text": "Golden Balls\n\nGolden Balls is a British daytime game show which was presented by Jasper Carrott. It was broadcast on the ITV network from 18 June 2007 to 18 December 2009. It was filmed at the BBC Television Centre. Golden Balls Ltd licensed their name to Endemol for the game show and merchandise.\n\nAt the back of the studio is the \"Golden Bank,\" a giant contraption like a lottery machine. Inside are 100 golden balls, containing cash values that range from £10 to £75,000. Twelve of these balls are randomly drawn from the Golden Bank and put into a mixer, and four \"Killer\" balls are added by Amanda Grant, referred to by Carrott as the \"Balls' Assistant\" or \"Killer Queen.\" These 16 balls are split equally and randomly among four contestants, each of whom places two balls on their own front and back row holders without looking inside. As Carrott introduces the contestants, they open their front-row balls for all to see.\n\nFollowing the introductions, the contestants each secretly look at their own back-row balls and announce the contents; they may either tell the truth or lie as they see fit. They then discuss who they think is lying and try to establish who has the worst set of balls, in terms of the lowest total value and/or the most Killer balls. Each contestant secretly casts one vote as to whom they want to remove from the game. The contestant who receives the most votes is eliminated with no winnings. In the event of a two-way tie, the contestants not involved in it must discuss further and try to reach a consensus. If they do, the chosen contestant is eliminated; if not, each tied contestant is given one more ball at random, dispensed from the mixer. One is a Killer, the other is empty, and the person who receives the Killer is out of the game. If every contestant receives one vote, all four continue their discussion; the first three to reach an agreement on who should be eliminated advance to the next round.\n\nAll four contestants reveal their back-row balls, and the eliminated contestant must then \"bin\" their balls, dropping them down a chute and removing them permanently from play.\n\nThe remaining balls from the three surviving contestants are closed and put into the mixer. Two more cash balls are drawn from the Golden Bank, and one more Killer is added to give a total of 15 balls in play. Each contestant receives five balls, placing two on their front row and three on their back, and play proceeds as in Round 1.\n\nThe two remaining contestants' balls are again closed and put back into the mixer, and one more Killer ball is added to give a total of 11 balls in play. The balls are mixed and placed on a table, with the contestants seated at opposite ends. Starting with the contestant who brought more money into this round, each first chooses one ball to \"bin\" (eliminate) and then one to \"win\" (place in the jackpot). Each ball is opened as it is chosen. If a cash ball is chosen to win, its value is added to the potential jackpot; if a Killer is chosen, the jackpot is immediately divided by 10. Any \"win\" Killers that are found before the first \"win\" cash ball do not affect the jackpot. The contestants take turns choosing until they have five \"win\" balls, after which the one remaining ball is opened and binned.\n\nDepending on the distribution of the balls in the first two rounds, the number of Killers in play at the start of this round can range from one to six.\n\nEach contestant is given a set of two balls, one each marked \"Split\" and \"Steal,\" and must secretly choose one to indicate their intentions after looking inside to confirm which is which. The contestants may speak to each other and ask Carrott for advice before making their decision.\n\n\nThe \"Split or Steal?\" game element, essentially a variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma, was also used on \"Shafted\", a previous Endemol production, and on the American game show \"Friend or Foe?\".\n\nGolden Balls has attracted attention from social scientists as a natural experiment on cooperation. A team of economists including Richard Thaler have analysed the decisions of the final contestants and found, among other things, the following:\n\n\nThe first show opened with 1.6 million viewers. Viewership climbed to a steady 2 million viewers. In the same 17:00 timeslot, eight of the first eleven episodes beat Channel 4's \"Richard & Judy\", and \"The Weakest Link\" on BBC Two also took a dent from the show's success. Series 2 went on to average 2.1 million viewers in early 2008. As of summer 2009, the show's popularity fell; it attracted only around 1.2 million viewers, which led to the show's termination on 18 December 2009. It is still regularly shown throughout the week on Challenge in the UK and Republic of Ireland although usually during off-peak times. It is now also showing on ITV again but usually after midnight.\n\nBritish psychologist Adrian Raine has criticised the show, arguing that it \"encourages deceitfulness\", and that many of its contestants are celebrated for displaying \"characteristics of psychopathy\". In a review of other ITV quiz show The Colour Of Money, Charlie Brooker criticizes Golden Balls' rules, saying that \"[Golden Balls] has more rules and clauses than the European Convention on Human Rights\"\n\nA video game was released on the Nintendo DS and Wii platforms, and another version for mobile devices was released in 2007. In 2008, an interactive DVD game was released by Channel 4. Other versions include an electronic board game in 2007 and a card game in 2008.\n\nAn Argentine version aired on América Televisión in 2008, hosted by Horacio Cabak.\n\n"}

Released on Full Moon Records, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers (reissued in 2004 on Wounded Bird Records), the album was not commercially successful, peaking at number 143 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart in March 1982, after making its first appearance on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart on January 23, 1982 at number 192. However, it is notable because Cetera is the sole writer of all songs on the album save one—\"I Can Feel It,\" which Cetera co-wrote with Ricky Fataar and Carl Wilson. Wilson, a member of the Beach Boys and a friend of Cetera's, also played guitar on the song. The single \"Livin' In The Limelight,\" the only hit from the album, was released on November 18, 1981, and charted at number six in the Billboard Mainstream Rock.\n\nOne year after \"Peter Cetera\" was released, Cetera and Chicago launched a major comeback with the number one single, \"Hard to Say I'm Sorry\", and album, \"Chicago 16\". After 1984's \"Chicago 17\" was also a massive hit, Cetera left the band to concentrate fully on his solo career. The song, \"On the Line\", which appears on this album, was on the B-side of the 45 RPM single of Cetera's first number one song as a solo performer in 1986, \"Glory of Love\".\n\nThe album was produced by Cetera and Jim Boyer and was recorded digitally.\n\nThe painting of Cetera playing the bass guitar, used for the album cover, was by John Nieto. Contemporary artist Nieto is known for his use of vibrant, electric hues and bold strokes in his paintings. The photograph of Cetera on the dust cover inside was by Diane Nini.\n\nWhen Columbia Records dropped Chicago in 1981, Cetera was in the middle of recording his first solo album for the same label. He had to personally buy the rights to the album before it could be released. According to Cetera, Chicago's new record company, Warner Bros., released the \"Peter Cetera\" album while it was waiting for \"Chicago 16\" to be released. Cetera has asserted that one reason for the album's poor commercial success, however, was lack of support from the record company: the record company didn't want it to be successful and didn't promote it for fear that he would leave the group. In his 2011 autobiography, former Chicago bandmate, Danny Seraphine, backs up Cetera on this point, writing, \"... [the album] sank like a stone due to lack of record company support. Warner Brothers didn't want it to interfere with their plans for Chicago.\" A full-page advertisement announcing the album appeared on page 100 of the November 21, 1981 issue of \"Billboard\" magazine .\n\nAll songs written by Peter Cetera, except where noted.\n\nSide One\n\n1. “Livin' In The Limelight” – 4:20\n2. “I Can Feel It” (Cetera, Ricky Fataar, Carl Wilson) – 3:07\n3. “How Many Times” – 4:21\n4. “Holy Moly” – 4:25\n5. “Mona Mona” – 3:18\nSide Two\n\n6. “On The Line” – 4:00\n7. “Not Afraid To Cry” – 3:27\n8. “Evil Eye” – 2:37\n9. “Practical Man” – 4:49\n10. “Ivy Covered Walls” – 3:56\nSong listing and personnel from vinyl LP liner notes.\n\nSong times from vinyl LP label.\n"}

Royal Pyrotechnie, recognized as the most decorated fireworks firm in Canada, is the only group to win three Gold Jupiter awards during the annual L'International des Feux Loto-Québec competition.\n\nTo celebrate Canada's 150th anniversary, each of the competitors were required to include one iconic Canadian song into their display, extending the traditional length of the shows (25 minutes) for an additional 3 minutes (for a total of 28 minutes). The songs were voted by the public on Honda's Celebration of Light Facebook page; the three chosen were \"Ahead by a Century\" by The Tragically Hip, \"Hallelujah\" by Leonard Cohen, and \"Summer of '69\" by Bryan Adams. The winner of the competition was Japan.\n\nThe 2016 Honda Celebration of Light took place on July 23, July 27, and July 30.

{"id": "2322480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322480", "title": "Kensington, Philadelphia", "text": "Kensington, Philadelphia\n\nKensington is a neighborhood in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Its placement within the broader division of sections of Philadelphia is debated, but it is often considered as a dividing line between or belonging to both the Lower Northeast section of Philadelphia and North Philadelphia. It is generally considered part of the Philadelphia River Wards. Modern Kensington is larger than the former Kensington District, and unlike Kensington District it does not include Fishtown. As with all neighborhoods in Philadelphia, the lack of any official designation means the boundaries of the area vary between sources and over time.\n\nTraditionally, Kensington is known for its large working class Irish Catholic community. Kensington was the location of the Philadelphia Nativist Riots in the 19th century. Kensington is also the birthplace of the K&A Gang, (currently known as the Northeast Philly Irish Mob), an Irish American organized crime network. Originally, Kensington was also home to a large, and largely invisible, English American community. For example, the five Episcopal parishes in the neighborhood (Emmanuel, Free Church of St. John, Good Shepherd, St. Ambrose, St. Luke's, and St. Nathanael's) were founded by 19th century immigrants from England. \n\nAlong with Irish Americans, Kensington is also home to a large population of Hispanic Americans (mainly Puerto Ricans, Dominicans), African Americans, and Polish Americans. The neighborhood has also recently seen a large influx of young urban professionals and gentrification.\n\nGenerally accepted boundaries are the triangular area bounded by the Amtrak train tracks and Castor Avenue to the north, Front Street (and sometimes Fifth Street) to the West and Trenton Avenue and Trenton Avenue train tracks to the East. Within these boundaries, sub-neighborhoods include East Kensington, Harrowgate, Lower Kensington, West Kensington, Fishtown, and Olde Richmond. Due to colloquial changes in the boundaries of the area since the Act of Consolidation, 1854, no clear definition is possible. The Greater Kensington area of the city roughly coincides with the former Kensington District, Richmond District, Aramingo Borough and Northern Liberties Township. Since incorporation into the City of Philadelphia (see Act of Consolidation, 1854), these areas have evolved over time to include portions of the modern \"Kensington\". The area is just a couple of miles northeast of Center City and just to the West of the Port Richmond neighborhood. Bordering neighborhoods include West Kensington and Fairhill to the west, Olde Kensington and Fishtown to the south, Olde Richmond and Port Richmond to the east, and Juniata to the north.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service designates Kensington as ZIP codes 19125 (Kensington Station) The U.S. Postal service considers 19134 (Richmond Station) as the area known as Port Richmond. Adjacent neighborhoods are Northern Liberties ZIP code 19123, Fishtown and Olde Richmond ZIP code 19125 (sub neighborhoods of Kensington), Port Richmond ZIP code 19134, Juniata, and Frankford.\n\nKensington was founded by Anthony Palmer in the early 1730s. Palmer purchased what was called the Fairman Estate, located along the Delaware River in the Northern Liberties Township (area just North of the City of Philadelphia on the Delaware River) The entire estate consisted of 191.5 acres of land, much smaller than the Kensington we know of today. Palmer was an English merchant, who came to Philadelphia at least by 1704, from Barbados. The town of Kensington was named for the area in London known as Kensington, which was recently established as the residency of the British crown.\nPalmer laid out his town and sold parcels to many of the shipwrights and shipbuilders who were outgrowing their riverfront lots in today's Old City neighborhood, Southwark, and Society Hill areas. He also sold to recent German fishermen immigrants. The original area of Kensington is now more commonly called \"Fishtown\" mainly because of the Shad Fishing that was one of the dominant businesses in Kensington in the 18th and 19th centuries. Anthony Palmer was active in local government and was a member of the Pennsylvania colony's council. As head of council, Palmer became the acting Provincial Governor of Pennsylvania in 1747 and 1748. Palmer died in 1749 and is buried in Christ Church Burial Grounds in Old City section of Philadelphia.[needs citations]\n\nKensington has traditionally been known as one of the great working class centers of Philadelphia. Initially, employment focused around the nearby waterfront, and the activities of fishermen and ship- and boat-builders. In the early 19th century, Kensington transitioned to iron and steel manufacture, and became home to a variety of factories, potteries, and machine works. By the mid-19th century, Kensington became one of the leading centers of the textile industry, particularly in carpet manufacture. McNeil Laboratories began with the purchase of a pharmacy in the area in 1879 by the company's namesake. In 1903 Mother Jones organized a \"Children's Crusade\" of children from the local mills and mines to protest against child labor. They marched from Kensington to Oyster Bay, New York, carrying banners demanding \"We want to go to School and not the mines!\"\n\nDeindustrialization eventually took its hold on the neighborhood in the 1950s, leading to a significant population loss, high unemployment, economic decline, and the abandoning of homes in the neighborhood. However, some sections of the neighborhood have been revitalized in recent years, especially those near Frankford Avenue, Kensington's neighbor south of Lehigh Avenue, and Fishtown, an area of Kensington where many Shad fisheries were located, another traditionally working-class neighborhood which has seen rents increase. While most of the large manufacturers have left, the area has many small shops and large renovated factories and warehouses for newer artisans to set up shop.\n\nListed on the National Register of Historic Places:\n\nAs of the 2010 Census, Kensington was 38.9% Hispanic of any race, 37.4% non Hispanic white, 14.8% non Hispanic black, 6.2% Asian, and 2.7% all other.\n\nThe United States Post Office operates the Kensington Post Office at 1602 Frankford Ave.\n\nThe intersection of Kensington and Allegheny Avenues (commonly referred to by Philadelphians as \"K & A\") is a major transportation and retail hub in the Kensington neighborhood, as it is served by the Frankford Elevated portion of the Market–Frankford Line which, running on top of Kensington Avenue, dominates the intersection. SEPTA City Bus routes (on Kensington Avenue, running underneath the \"El\") and on Allegheny Avenue, with route nearby on Frankford Avenue, also serve the K & A area.\n\nThe School District of Philadelphia operates public schools. Public schools in Kensington include Kensington High School Complex, Jules E. Mastbaum Vocational Technical High School, Russell Conwell Middle Magnet School and John H. Webster Elementary School. There is also a charter school Sankofa Freedom Academy Charter School.\n\nIn 2011 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia announced the closures of three Kensington Catholic schools, as their student numbers had declined: Ascension of Our Lord, St. Anne, and St. Hugh of Cluny.\n\nThe Free Library of Philadelphia operates the McPherson Square Branch at 601 East Indiana Avenue, and the Kensington Branch at 104 W Dauphin Street.\n\nKensington was the birthplace of the K&A Gang, an Irish American organized crime association known for their distribution of methamphetamine in the 1980s.\n\nThe intersection of Kensington Avenue and Somerset Street was listed number one in a 2007 list of the city's top ten recreational drug corners according to an article by \"Philadelphia Weekly\" reporter Steve Volk. It is also known as an area of prostitution.\n\nIn 2010, three victims were found strangled. The killer is referred to by the media as \"The Kensington Strangler\". A \"person of interest\" in the case, Antonio Rodriguez, was arrested in January 2011. Rodriguez confessed to the murders and was sentenced to life in prison in 2012.\n\nKensington is known for having some of the highest rates of heroin use in the United States.\n\nTaylor, politician\n\n\n"}

Population: \n\nIt was founded on the banks of the river of that name by order of the Catherine the Great on August 3 (14), 1777. The town developed in following stages:\n\nLuga was founded as a town in Pskov Viceroyalty, but in March 3 (14), 1782 it was transferred to St. Petersburg Governorate (renamed Petrogradsky in 1913 and Leningradsky in 1924) and became the seat of Luzhsky Uyezd. In 1918, important events of the Russian Civil War took place in the area, when the White Army unsuccessfully tried to conquer Petrograd.\n\nOn August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished and Luzhsky District, with the administrative center in Luga, was established. The governorates were also abolished and the district became a part of Luga Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished as well and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On September 19, 1939, Luga became a town of oblast significance and was thus no longer a part of the district.\n\nThe World War II German advance on Leningrad was temporarily halted by seven regular, militia, and irregular divisions in the Luga area and this delayed the commencement of the Siege of Leningrad by over a month. In recognition of this feat, the town was awarded the title of \"Hero City\" and listed as one of the World War II Cities of Military Glory by Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia. German occupation of Luga lasted from August 24, 1941 to February 12, 1944.\n\nIn 2010, the administrative structure of Leningrad Oblast was harmonized with its municipal structure and Luga became a town of district significance.\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Luga serves as the administrative center of Luzhsky District. As an administrative division, it is, together with four rural localities, incorporated within Luzhsky District as Luzhskoye Settlement Municipal Formation.

He is a life member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He served as the president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza from 1974 to 2004 and as U.S. Ambassador to the Dominican Republic from November 2010 to May 2013.\n\nYzaguirre was born to Mexican American parents Ruben Antonio and Eva Linda (Morin) Yzaguirre and grew up in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas. Yzaguirre states that some of his first memories of social injustice involved what his grandmother called a \"race war\" in Texas. Mexican Americans lived under a curfew at that time and Yzaguirre's grandfather was almost lynched one night when coming home after dark from his second job.\n\nIn 1958, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force Medical Service and served for four years.\n\nHe has a B.S. George Washington University.\n\nHis name has sometimes been spelled Izaguirre.\n\nIn 1968, the Southwest Council of La Raza was organized with funding from the Ford Foundation. By 1972, the organization had changed its name to the National Council for La Raza and moved its offices to Washington, D.C. In 1997, the Ford Foundation, the NCLR's sole funding source, demanded a change in the organization's focus and direction by threatening to withhold funding and forced its president, Henry Santiestevan, out of office.\n\nIn 1974, Yzaguirre was elected the second president of the NCLR. The Ford Foundation was pleased with Yzaguirre and continued to be a top donor of the NCLR throughout his term.\n\nUnder Yzaguirre, the organization grew from a regional advocacy group with 17 affiliates to over 300 that serve 41 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. Yzaguirre expanded membership criteria so it was not limited only to ethnic Mexicans, but also included Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Argentines, Cubans, Venezuelans and all other Hispanic subgroups. This paved the way for the National Council for La Raza to open offices in Chicago, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Sacramento, San Antonio, and San Juan. Since then NCLR has added offices in New York and Atlanta.\n\nThrough his tenure Yzaguirre built the NCLR into a 35,000 members organization, with revenues exceeding $3 million, from a combination of contributions from American corporations, philanthropic foundations, federal funding, and private member donations.\n\nHe was fired as chair of the Hispanic Advisory Commission to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for publicly criticizing President Carter's immigration reform proposals. Yzaguirre also criticized President George H.W. Bush for his affirmative action stance even after he had agreed to be the first sitting president to appear at an NCLR Annual Conference. Yzaguirre criticized President Clinton for appointing very few Hispanics to key positions and for the 1996 welfare reform law which NCLR considered detrimental to the Hispanic community and resigned as chair of the President's Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans in protest of political machinations.\n\nOn November 30, 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Yzaguirre to be U.S. Ambassador to the Dominican Republic. His appointment was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on September 29, 2010. He resigned his service in that post on May 29, 2013, and now resides in Mount Airy, Maryland.\n\nYzaguirre is a lifetime member and serves on the Member Selection Committee of the David Rockefeller-headed Council on Foreign Relations. and was a member of the Independent Task Force on North America.\n\nThe Raul Yzaguirre Policy Institute operates out of the University of Texas-Pan American and was named after Yzaguirre. Its stated goal is,\"To inform policy, and the civic leaders who frame it, for the benefit of the Hispanic community and the nation as a whole.\" The institute primarily receives corporate and government funding, continuing Yzaguirre's commitment to bringing corporate interests and government interests together. Its new facilities were partially funded with a 2005 Department of Education earmark of $635,000.\n\nThe advisory council of the institute represent a who's who of government and corporate elite, including politicians such as Hillary Clinton, John McCain, former President of Mexico Ernesto Zedillo whose role at the institute will be to provides expertise to the \"global perspectives\" area of work for the institute. As well as corporate leaders of UPS, Coca-Cola and Frito-Lay.\n\nAs part of Michael Crow's commitment to a \"New American University\" at Arizona State University, he appointed Yzaguirre to the position of presidential professor of practice in community development and civil rights at ASU. One of the boards that he serves on at ASU is the North American Center of Transborder Studies (NACTS) which has a goal of advancing teaching and research on North American regional integration by providing a space for professionals in the university, policy and business communities to share information about the region and encourage instructors to incorporate North American content into their courses.\n\nThe NACTS is a project of the Pan American Partnership for Business Education, the Council of the Americas, and the Kansas City International Affairs and Trade Office, which is part of North America's SuperCorridor Coalition (NASCO).\n\nYzaguirre is a member of the boards of the Volunteers of America; United Way of America; and National Hispanic Leadership Agenda; .\nYzaguirre was a member of Sears, Roebuck's & Co. and AARP Services Inc. In 1973, he was originally elected to Common Cause's National Governing Board. He was re-elected to the Common Cause Board in 1991.He resigned from his board position at the Salvation Army in protest of their homophobic positions.\n\nIn 1979, Yzaguirre was the first Hispanic to receive a Rockefeller Public Service Award for Outstanding Public Service, endowed by John D. Rockefeller Jr. from the trustees of Princeton University.\n\nYzaguirre received the Order of the Aztec Eagle in 1993, the highest honor awarded by Mexico to citizens of another nation.\n\nThe NCLR headquarters building in Washington, D.C., was named after him in 2005.\n\nThe Raul Yzaguirre Schools for Success in Houston was named after him; in 2017 the high school was renamed as the Raul Yzaguirre STEM Early College High School.\n\n"}

{"id": "2322506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322506", "title": "Fantastic Planet", "text": "Fantastic Planet\n\nFantastic Planet (, , lit. \"The Wild Planet\") is a 1973 adult animated science fiction film directed by René Laloux and written by Laloux and Roland Topor. Topor also completed the film's production design and it was animated at Jiří Trnka Studio in Prague. The film was an international co-production between companies from France and Czechoslovakia. The allegorical story, about humans living on a strange planet dominated by giant humanoid aliens who consider them animals, is based on the 1957 novel \"Oms en série\" by French writer Stefan Wul.\n\nA working title while in development was \"Sur la planète Ygam\" (\"On the Planet Ygam\"), which is where most of the story takes place; the actual title (\"The Fantastic/Savage Planet\") is the name of Ygam's moon. Production began in 1963. The film was awarded the Grand Prix special jury prize at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival, and in 2016, it was ranked the 36th greatest animated movie ever by \"Rolling Stone\".\n\nIn the distant future, the gargantuan blue humanoid Draags have brought human beings (who are called Oms as a play on the French word for \"man\", \"homme\") from Earth to the planet Ygam, where they maintain a technologically and spiritually advanced society. The Draags consider Oms animals, and while they keep some as pets, others live in the wilderness and are periodically slaughtered by the Draags, who wish to control their population. Draags have much longer lifespans than Oms, but reproduce much less.\n\nWhen an Om mother is teased to death by three Draag children, her orphaned infant is found by Master Sinh, a key Draag leader, and his daughter Tiwa, who keeps the boy as a pet and names him Terr. Tiwa loves Terr and is careful not to hurt him, but, in accordance with her parents' instructions, keeps him under control, giving him a collar with which she can pull him in any direction. She brings Terr to sessions in which she receives her education using headphones that transmit knowledge into her mind, and a defect in his collar allows him to receive the knowledge too. Around the time that Tiwa grows into her teens and first performs Draag meditation, which allows the species to travel with their minds, she loses some interest in Terr, who has become a young man and acquired much Draag knowledge. He escapes into the wilderness, stealing Tiwa's headphones.\n\nThere he runs into a wild female Om, who cuts off his collar and introduces him to her tribe, which lives in an abandoned Draag park full of strange creatures and landscapes. Terr shows them how to use the headphones to acquire Draag knowledge and literacy, winning the right to do so in a duel. The literacy they gain allows them to read a Draag announcement that the park will be purged of Oms, and, when the purge comes, some are slaughtered by Draag technology while others escape, joining forces with another tribe. They are attacked by two Draag passers-by and manage to kill one of them before escaping to an abandoned Draag rocket depot, much to the outrage of Draag leaders.\n\nThey live there for years, joined by many other Oms, and, due to the knowledge acquired from Terr's headphones, manage to replicate Draag technology, including two rockets; they hope to leave Ygam for its moon, the Fantastic Planet, and live there safe from Draags. When a large-scale Draag purge hits the depot and many Oms are slaughtered, a group led by Terr uses the rockets to flee to the Fantastic Planet, where they discover large statues that Draags travel to during meditation and use to meet beings from other galaxies in a strange ritual that maintains their species. The Oms destroy some of the statues, threatening the Draags' existence; the genocide is halted on Ygam, and, facing a crisis, the Draags sue for peace. This leads to an era of peaceful coexistence between the two species, who now benefit from each other's way of thinking.\n\n\nThe film's score was composed by Alain Goraguer. In a review for AllMusic, François Couture noted:\nIn 2000, DC Recordings released the soundtrack on CD, and the soundtrack was later released on LP.\n\nThe film's narrative has been considered to be an allegory about animal rights and human rights, as well as racism. Sean Axmaker of Turner Classic Movies referred to the film as \"nothing if not allegorical\", writing that \"it's not a stretch to see the fight against oppression reflected in the civil rights struggle in America, the French in Algeria, Apartheid in South Africa, and (when injustice takes a turn to wholesale annihilation of the 'inferior' race) the Holocaust itself\".\n\nLiz Ohanesian of \"LA Weekly\" speculated on the film being a commentary on animal rights, using the Draag's treatment of the Oms as evidence and writing that the film places \"humans in roles of pets and pests\". Mike D'Angelo of \"The A.V. Club\" wrote that \"The Traag-Om dynamic is broad enough to be multipurpose, reflecting both racism and animal rights via 'How would \"you\" like it?' role reversal\".\n\nThe film was reported to have a total of 809,945 admissions in France.\n\n\"Fantastic Planet\" has received generally positive reviews. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 90% based on 30 reviews with an average rating of 7.24/10. The site's critical consensus reads \"Fantastic Planet is an animated epic that is by turns surreal and lovely, fantastic and graceful\".\n\nHoward Thompson of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the film offers \"original, thoughtful, often strong (but tasteful) animation\". Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"disquieting, eerie and vastly imaginative.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four and called it \"an animated piece of science-fiction pretending to be a Meaningful Statement ... According to publicists for the film, the visuals and story begin to make sense if your mind is chemically altered. I doubt it.\"\n\nAmong retrospective reviews, Carson Lund of \"Slant Magazine\" gave the film a score of three-and-a-half out of five possible stars, writing that \"by the film’s conclusion, it’s hard to feel comfortable with similar episodes on our own imperfect planet\". Mike D'Angelo of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the film a rating of \"B+\", writing that \"\"Fantastic Planet\" [should] seem extremely dated, yet it’s ultimately too singular to feel beholden to a particular era. It truly earns the adjective in its title\". Alan Morrison of \"Empire\" gave the film four out of five stars and called it \"Surreal and wonderful in a way not often seen from Europe\".\n\nMaitland McDonagh of \"TV Guide\" gave the film three out of four stars, calling it an \"Eerie, surreal and a welcome respite from Disney-style animation\". Scott Thill of \"Wired\" called the film \"a sterling example of the trippy animation ambition of the late '60s and early '70s\". Gary Dauphin of \"The Village Voice\" wrote that \"Although the visuals are worth the ticket alone, \"Fantastic Planet\" also crackles with emotional and political resonance\". Paul Trandahl of Common Sense Media gave the film a rating of four out of five stars, calling the film \"A jarring examination of racism and intolerance\".\n\nIn 2016, \"Fantastic Planet\" was ranked the 36th greatest animated movie ever by \"Rolling Stone\".\n\nThe film won the Special Prize at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nFollowing various public domain VHS releases of the film, it was released by Anchor Bay Entertainment on VHS and DVD on 16 February 1999. In 2006, Eureka Entertainment released the film on DVD in the United States as #34 in their Masters of Cinema line. In August 2010, Eureka released a restored high-definition transfer of the film on Blu-ray, with special features including a collection of Laloux's short films and a 27-minute documentary called \"Laloux sauvage\". Eureka, a London-based company, has produced the edition only as a Region B release.\n\nOn 23 October 2007, Facets Video and Accent Cinema released a newly restored version on DVD, including many bonus features never available before. In June 2016, the Criterion Collection released the film on Blu-ray and DVD.\n\n"}
