Surface primary form, surface fractality and surface roughness are the parameters most commonly associated with the field. It is important to many disciplines and is mostly known for the machining of precision parts and assemblies which contain mating surfaces or which must operate with high internal pressures.\n\nSurface finish may be measured in two ways: \"contact\" and \"non-contact\" methods. Contact methods involve dragging a measurement stylus across the surface; these instruments are called profilometers. Non-contact methods include: interferometry, digital holography, confocal microscopy, focus variation, structured light, electrical capacitance, electron microscopy, and photogrammetry.\n\nThe most common method is to use a diamond stylus profilometer. The stylus is run perpendicular to the lay of the surface. The probe usually traces along a straight line on a flat surface or in a circular arc around a cylindrical surface. The length of the path that it traces is called the \"measurement length\". The wavelength of the lowest frequency filter that will be used to analyze the data is usually defined as the \"sampling length\". Most standards recommend that the measurement length should be at least seven times longer than the sampling length, and according to the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem it should be at least two times longer than the wavelength of interesting features. The \"assessment length\" or \"evaluation length\" is the length of data that will be used for analysis. Commonly one sampling length is discarded from each end of the measurement length. 3D measurements can be made with a profilometer by scanning over a 2D area on the surface.\n\nThe disadvantage of a profilometer is that it is not accurate when the size of the features of the surface are close to the same size as the stylus. Another disadvantage is that profilometers have difficulty detecting flaws of the same general size as the roughness of the surface. There are also limitations for non-contact instruments. For example, instruments that rely on optical interference cannot resolve features that are less than some fraction of the operating wavelength. This limitation can make it difficult to accurately measure roughness even on common objects, since the interesting features may be well below the wavelength of light. The wavelength of red light is about 650 nm, while the average roughness, (R) of a ground shaft might be 200 nm.\n\nThe first step of analysis is to filter the raw data to remove very high frequency data (called \"micro-roughness\") since it can often be attributed to vibrations or debris on the surface. Filtering out the micro-roughness at a given cut-off threshold also allows to bring closer the roughness assessment made using profilometers having different stylus ball radius e.g. 2 µm and 5 µm radii. Next, the data is separated into roughness, waviness and form. This can be accomplished using reference lines, envelope methods, digital filters, fractals or other techniques. Finally, the data is summarized using one or more roughness parameters, or a graph. In the past, surface finish was usually analyzed by hand. The roughness trace would be plotted on graph paper, and an experienced machinist decided what data to ignore and where to place the mean line. Today, the measured data is stored on a computer, and analyzed using methods from signal analysis and statistics.\n\nStylus-based contact instruments have the following advantages:\n\n\"Technologies\":\n\n\nOptical measurement instruments have some advantages over the tactile ones as follows:\n\n\"Vertical scanning\":\n\n\n\"Horizontal scanning\":\n\n\"Non-scanning\"\n\nBecause every instrument has advantages and disadvantages the operator must choose the right instrument depending on the measurement application. In the following some advantages and disadvantages to the main technologies are listed:\n\nThe scale of the desired measurement will help decide which type of microscope will be used.\n\nFor 3D measurements, the probe is commanded to scan over a 2D area on the surface. The spacing between data points may not be the same in both directions.\n\nIn some cases, the physics of the measuring instrument may have a large effect on the data. This is especially true when measuring very smooth surfaces. For contact measurements, most obvious problem is that the stylus may scratch the measured surface. Another problem is that the stylus may be too blunt to reach the bottom of deep valleys and it may round the tips of sharp peaks. In this case the probe is a physical filter that limits the accuracy of the instrument.\n\nThe real surface geometry is so complicated that a finite number of parameters cannot provide a full description. If the number of parameters used is increased, a more accurate description can be obtained. This is one of the reasons for introducing new parameters for surface evaluation. Surface roughness parameters are normally categorised into three groups according to its functionality. These groups are defined as amplitude parameters, spacing parameters, and hybrid parameters.\n\nParameters used to describe surfaces are largely statistical indicators obtained from many samples of the surface height. Some examples include:\n\nThis is a small subset of available parameters described in standards like ASME B46.1 and ISO 4287.\nMost of these parameters originated from the capabilities of profilometers and other mechanical probe systems. \nIn addition, new measures of surface dimensions have been developed which are more directly related to the measurements made possible by high-definition optical gauging technologies.\n\nMost of these parameters can be estimated using the SurfCharJ plugin for the ImageJ.\n\nThe surface roughness can also be calculated over an area. This gives S instead of R values. The ISO 25178 series describes all these roughness values in detail. The advantage over the profile parameters are:\n\n\nSurfaces have fractal properties, multi-scale measurements can also be made such as Length-scale Fractal Analysis or Area-scale Fractal Analysis.\n\nTo obtain the surface characteristic almost all measurements are subject to filtering. It is one of the most important topics when it comes to specifying and controlling surface attributes such as roughness, waviness, and form error. These components of the surface deviations must be distinctly separable in measurement to achieve a clear understanding between the surface supplier and the surface recipient as to the expected characteristics of the surface in question. \nTypically, either digital or analog filters are used to separate form error, waviness, and roughness resulting from a measurement. Main multi-scale filtering methods are Gaussian filtering, Wavelet transform and more recently Discrete Modal Decomposition. There are three characteristics of these filters that should be known in order to understand the parameter values that an instrument may calculate. These are the spatial wavelength at which a filter separates roughness from waviness or waviness from form error, the sharpness of a filter or how cleanly the filter separates two components of the surface deviations and the distortion of a filter or how much the filter alters a spatial wavelength component in the separation process.\n\n\n"}

It embodied agreements between the two principal powers of the German Confederation, Prussia and Austria, over the governing of the 'Elbe Duchies' of Schleswig, Holstein and Saxe-Lauenburg. \n\nThe Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein had been united under Danish rule since 1460. While Schleswig north of the Eider River was a Danish fief, the Duchies of Holstein officially remained an estate of the Holy Roman Empire which the Kings of Denmark held as an Imperial fief. In 1815 King Frederick VI of Denmark also acquired the adjacent Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg. Both Holstein and Lauenburg were member states of the German Confederation since 1815. \n\nWhen in 1858 the Danish national liberal Council President Carl Christian Hall drafted the 'November Constitution' in order to link Schleswig more closely to the Danish kingdom, he sparked German protests, and troops of the German Confederation eventually occupied Holstein and Lauenburg in 1863. In the following Second Schleswig War, Denmark was defeated and according to the Treaty of Vienna signed on 30 October 1864 had to cede the Elbe Duchies to victorious Prussia and Austria. \n\nAfter the war, the two powers faced the issue of governing the provinces formerly held by the Danish royal House of Glücksburg in personal union. Prussia aimed at the annexation of the territories as provinces with her state territory, against the strong resistance of the Austrians, who persisted on the status of autonomous duchies of the Confederation ruled as a condominium. To ease tensions, the Prussian minister-president Otto von Bismarck met with the Austrian envoy Gustav von Blome at the spa town of Bad Gastein in the Austrian Alps.\n\nIn the negotiations, the administration of the gained territories was split between the two powers: Prussia would rule over Schleswig and Austria over Holstein. Austria would officially renounce Saxe-Lauenburg, which would be ruled by the Prussian king in personal union for a purchase price of 2.5 million Danish rigsdalers.\n\nThe eleven articles of the agreement signed on 14 August 1865 covered:\nThe treaty was ratified by both parties on 19 August. King William I of Prussia went on to rule Lauenburg in personal union and assumed the ducal title.\n\nBismarck's negotiation skills had apparently been underestimated by Blome. Though Prussia benefitted from the treaty, the minister-president noted that the 'bonding of cracks' did not answer the German question nor did it ease the Austria–Prussia rivalry. Moreover the treaty ran counter to the legal basis of the German Confederation, which led to the refusal by the smaller Confederation states and turned out detrimental to the reputation especially of the Austrian side. The European powers reacted strongly, the French emperor Napoleon III responded with protest, while the British saw their interests in the North Sea as threatened; the treaty was nevertheless appreciated by Russia in view of her enmity with Austria after the Crimean War. \n\nThe Gastein Convention marked the end of all attempts to seek a peaceful solution of the German question. It soon collapsed due to Bismarck's successful efforts to provoke a war with the Austrian Empire as well as to eliminate Austria from the German Confederation. The Austrian government had tolerated the rule of Duke Frederick VIII of Schleswig-Holstein, much to the chagrin of Prussia. On 1 June 1866 Austria asked the Federal Convention for a resolution on the status of Holstein, which Prussia regarded as a breach of the mutual agreement. Under this pretext, Prussian troops entered Holstein nine days later which led to the outbreak of the Austro-Prussian War, also known as the Seven Weeks' War.\n\nThe Peace of Prague in 1866 confirmed Denmark's cession of Schlewig and Holstein, which were both annexed by Prussia, but promised a plebiscite to decide whether north Schleswig wished to return to Danish rule. This provision was bilaterally set aside by a resolution of Prussia and Austria in 1878. Instead the Prussian Province of Schleswig-Holstein was created in 1868. Both territories were to be admitted to the \"Zollverein\" (German Customs Union), headed by Prussia, of which Austria was not a member.\n"}

Himeko would like nothing more than to be a proper, feminine young lady, like her older sister Aiko, so that she could approach her secret crush, Hasekura.\n\nOne night, Himeko is unexpectedly approached by a girl, who is a near-mirror image of herself, floating outside of her bedroom window. She discovers that the girl is Princess Erika of the Magical Kingdom. Erika explains that people in the Magical Kingdom have an exact counterpart in the Human World and that, in order to prove herself worthy as a princess, she must give Himeko a magical item that she has created. Himeko is allowed the use of this item, a red hair ribbon, for one year to determine whether it is useful, and consequently, if Erika will inherit the crown.\n\nThe ribbon allows Himeko to transform into anyone in the Human World for one hour. If Himeko is unable to recite the magic incantation in reverse before the hour is up, she will be trapped in that person’s form for the rest of her life. She is unable to reveal the secret of the ribbon and the existence of the Magical Kingdom to anyone. If she does, her memory will be erased as punishment. Assisting her with this is her stuffed lion, Pokota, whom the ribbon brought to life. Erika will watch her in the Magic Kingdom through her crystal ball for one year, at which point the ribbon will be returned.\n\nIn authoring Hime-chan's Ribbon, Megumi Mizusawa used themes common to magical girl manga. The concept of being able to transform into other people had been a feature of Himitsu no Akko-chan (1962).\n\n\n and \n\n\nTo perform magic several different incantations are recited. When Hime-chan first receives the ribbon she is told to recite \"Parallel, Parallel, \"(person's name)\" ni nare\". After the excitement of transformation Hime-chan dismisses Erika's important instruction to recite this incantation saying \"Parallel\" backwards, \"Rurerapa rurerapa motono sugatani nare.\" which causes her to almost be caught as the Principal of the school forever. Pokota had to remind her of the correct way of pronouncing \"Rurerapa\" to avoid this.\n\nJennifer B from THEM Anime reviews stated that Hime-chan's Ribbon is \"a fun, cute series that's worth watching if you like magical girl shows\" and \"Hime-chan herself is a likable character\". Andrew Sheldon from Anime-Meta Review felt that \"The writing is well done, has a great sense of character and can be touching\". Kelly Mayback from the Anime Cafe: A Parent's Guide to Anime described it as \"an EXCELLENT series to use when exploring Japanese culture\".\n\nIn 2009 the series was remade, with manga creator Shiho Komiyuno penning the series. \"Hime-chan no Ribon Colorful\" premiered in the October 2009 issue of Ribon, the same magazine that the original series ran in. Differences between the two series included the setting being moved to modern day as well as the character of Pokota being replaced by a shape changing Princess Erika.\n\n"}

A double vinyl edition and a CD boxed set were also released in limited quantities of 666 and 3,000 copies, respectively.\n\n\"Songs from the Inverted Womb\" builds on the chamber music-inspired sound of the \"Dead Lovers' Sarabande\" albums by adding more conventional song structures and by adding a live drummer. With even more expressive arrangements and enhanced songwriting, \"Inverted Womb\" shares many properties with progressive rock. Two songs from previous albums were re-recorded: \"May I kiss your Wound ?\", from \"The Inexperienced Spiral Traveller\" appears in a new arrangement; while \"Résumé... -\" is a dramatic re-working of \"Time stands still...

{"id": "2285219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2285219", "title": "Symbols of leadership", "text": "Symbols of leadership\n\nLeadership cadres use symbols to reinforce their position power and provide a level of differentiation. Clothing frequently articulates rank or privilege, but accessories and external entities of varying functionality may also serve to mark out leaders - from finger rings to personal aircraft.\n\nPresidential symbols include many various insignia or other devices to denote a president's position. Some symbols follow accepted constitutional or diplomatic standards: flags, sashes, entrance Marches or a medallion or necklace. The use of the symbols mostly occurs for domestic purposes.\n\nExamples of such symbols include the American presidential march \"Hail to the Chief\", and the presidential sashes worn by the presidents of Latin America nations. More practical, semi-symbolic features also abound: bodyguards may lurk semi-overtly; a head of state may use a special aircraft (see for example Air Force One).\n\nEuropean presidents sometimes dress archaically for formal occasions. Such special clothing sets them apart - and may well militate against women aspiring to such high office when tradition expects them to wear (say) knee-breeches.\n\nRuling dynasties often exploit pomp and ceremony with the use of regalia: crowns, robes, orb and sceptres, some of which are reflections of formerly practical objects. The use of language mechanisms also support this differentiation with subjects talking of \"the crown\" and/or of \"the throne\" rather than referring directly to personal names and items.\n\nMonarchies provide the most explicit demonstration of tools to strengthen the elevation of leaders. Thrones sit high on daises leading to subjects lifting their gaze (if they have permission) to contemplate the ruler. Architecture in general can set leaders apart: note the symbolism inherent in the very name of the Chinese imperial Forbidden City.\n\nThe culture and legends about the ruling family may build on myths of divine-right and describe the ruler or the Son of Heaven.\n\nCourt ceremonial highlights symbolic distance between a royal/imperial leader and follower, in a hierarchical system which cultivates a social system and power network at whose centre is the monarch. Bowing and curtseying remain as examples of the self-abasement of hand-sucking, bowing and scraping, prostration, kowtowing and \"proskynesis\" formerly demanded.\n\nSometimes colour plays a special role in advertising monarchical status: thus the once very rare pink/maroon dye color became a symbol reserved for imperial clothing - see purple.\n\nArchaic touches often symbolically recall a glorious historical past: thus horse-drawn carriages replace everyday motor-vehicles for royal state occasions, and courtiers and flunkeys in elaborate dress grant a sense of ancient distance. And monarchs emphasize the remaining traces of their divine right to rule when undergoing anointing at the hands of the Church during coronation ceremonies.\n\nOverlapping with and/or emulating royalty, a ruling class or an aristocracy can devote much of its energy into \"keeping up appearances\" and emphasizing the purity of noble blood by apartness. Symbolism can aid this process cheaply. A coat-of-arms (perhaps in the form of a banner or on note-paper) or the wearing of a sword can incur less expense than maintaining a stately home. The visible presence of servants or slaves reminds underlings of social distance. Patronage, especially of fashion, provides one of the most symbolic attributes of social leaders or would-be leaders. Compare conspicuous consumption.\n\nApart from more elaborate uniform and their distinguishing marks (epaulettes, caps, medals), senior military officers may traditionally carry a baton or affect a similar substitute (such as a swagger stick or cane). Compare staff of office.\n\nBanners, pennants and guidons serve (or served in the past) to identify leaders as rallying-points or field command-posts. Traces of these continue on staff cars or on naval ships, for example: see broad pennant and compare the concept and origin of a flagship.\n\nReligious dignitaries often use vestments to emphasize the overall sacred nature of their organization. But some touches identify leaders and make them more imposing: a bishop's mitre, for example, a cardinal's red hat, a papal tiara or a papal ring. Less flamboyant faiths may use subtler symbolism to set religious leadership, holiness or saintliness apart: the understated dark vestments of the Protestant clergyman, the relatively unobtrusive clerical collar, or even the nakedness of a stereotypical Hindu ascetic fakir.\n\nOwnership of a harem has both practical and symbolic uses for leaders in traditional polygamous societies: harems spread genes and symbolically demonstrate wealth and status. Within such harems whole systems of symbolism may develop: the use of exclusive and inaccessible apartness, veiling, and the employment of eunuchs. Cultures which practise serial monogamy feature harem-analogous symbolism in the flaunting of trophy wives.\n\nItems such as codpieces may suggest the assumed superiority of one gender-role over another: or symbolic leadership (implied by implied potency) within patriarchal structures. A slightly less extreme example, but one more common in modern times, expresses power relationships (and thus leadership symbolism) through the use of the phrase \"wearing the trousers\".\n\nAncient Egyptian pharaohs used a stylised artificial labdanum-soaked goats-hair beard as one of the regalia of rulership: a clear case of associating a male attribute with leadership.\n\nThe suit continues to mark out the managerial class (which pretends to leadership functions) as a whole from ordinary blue-collar or non-suited workers. Suits stand at the apex of a system of dress code details: international standard business attire, with largely symbolic associations; see for example:\n\nAt the top levels of a bureaucratic organisation, senior leaders often attempt to merge the practical with the symbolic, making the perks of office appear functional: they may claim larger cars, smaller computers, an entrance guarded by a (non-digital) personal assistant, a large but uncluttered desk and (especially) a \"corner office\" with an aesthetically uplifting view.\n"}

It features eight playable characters, ten dungeons tied into a storyline, and eight hidden dungeons to explore. The game supports multiplayer via link cable as well as single player.\n\nThe game features eight character classes which can be improved up to level 200. Each is customisable with a variety of weapons, spells, support abilities, and attributes. Different classes who can use the same weapons attack differently with them. For example, the Warrior's spear attack is a thrust, while the Archer throws his spear over a distance. Each usable spell in the game has its own spellbook, and only classes with that spell on their skills list can use the spellbook to cast the spell.\n\n\nEach character is able to equip up to three weapons and three items for use, and switch between them at any time. The player can get 3 extra slots for either by equipping the Backpack or Knapsack. Attacks are performed by tapping the attack button, or holding to charge a more powerful attack. Beyond regular equipment, a \"Soul\" item can also be equipped; it is charged by defeating enemies, and unleashed to inflict massive damage on nearby enemies. They come in various elemental types and levels of effectiveness. They are graded on the Roman numerals I, II, III, IV and V, with V being the strongest and taking the longest to charge up.\n\nCharacters also have resistances to a number of elements: Fire, Ice, Thunder, Light, Dark and Poison. These can be raised by equipment, but also through endurance: by taking damage of a particular elemental kind, they can increase their resistance to it, but being killed by an attack of that type will decrease the resistance level by a point.\n\nThe multiplayer is very similar to that of \"Diablo\". The player characters navigate the dungeon and attack monsters. Players can give items to each other by throwing or dropping them. The party can only move to the next area when every player character has either passed the exit point of the current area or died. Opening the inventory window does not pause the game (in singleplayer or multiplayer), so some players can reorganize their inventory while others engage in combat. Some classes are more useful in multiplayer, such as the priestess or archer.\n\n\"Shining Soul II\" has little connection to the storyline of the rest of the series aside from a reference to the events of \"Shining Soul\" in the introduction. However, an alternate universe version of Boken from \"Shining Force\" appears as a major NPC, traditional Shining mascot Yogurt is hidden in one of the stages, and a number of dungeons from the original \"Shining Soul\" appear as short hidden dungeons.\n\nCenturies after the defeat of Dark Dragon in \"Shining Soul\", light had become too strong, opening the way to a resurgence of darkness. A crystal in the possession of King Marcel and Queen Yvonne of Klantol, which throughout the story reflects the current balance of light and darkness, turns from shining to cloudy. An alchemist named Gillespie, a member of a dark order, the Chaos Knights, worms his way into the friendship of King Marcel's most trusted knight, Deatharte. Gillespie then disappears, leaving something called \"the forbidden fruit\" with Deatharte. Driven by curiosity, Deatharte eventually eats the fruit and is corrupted by darkness.\n\nLater, a tournament at the Klantol Colosseum is interrupted by news that Princess Camille has been abducted. King Marcel orders Deatharte to search for her. Deatharte pretends to obey, but instead goes to join the Chaos Knights. Since Marcel is also concerned about an army of goblins mustering near the castle, he sends a promising young participant in the tournament (the player character) to investigate. Penetrating the goblin fort, the young hero not only confirms that the goblins were planning an attack on the castle, but learns that they abducted Camille and delivered her to the evil witch Wizari, who plans to sacrifice her to increase her power. The hero defeats the goblins and recovers the key to Camille's prison. Since Deatharte has naturally still not returned, Marcel relies upon the young hero to journey to Wizari's palace and save Camille. He succeeds in doing this and slaying Wizari.\n\nThe celebration is short-lived, as normally peaceful beings are driven mad by darkness. The hero's investigations of these incidents takes him to the mainland of Klantol, where he uncovers a plot by the Chaos Knights to conquer the world. Meanwhile, Princess Camille sneaks away to find Gillespie and manages to learn the password to the Chaos Knights' hidden stronghold. She is later trapped in Koldazhek Cave, but is rescued by the hero and tells him the password. Infiltrating the Chaos Knights' stronghold, the hero slays both Gillespie and Deatharte, who had become leader of the Chaos Knights.\n\nThe defeat of the Chaos Knights, however, causes a violent shift in balance from darkness to light, awakening a destructive power called Chaos, which even the forces of darkness fear. Marcel, Yvonne, Camille, and the court wizard are spirited away by Chaos. A former knight guides the hero to a passage to Chaos's realm. The hero goes there and defeats Chaos, rescuing the four prisoners and restoring balance to the world.\n\n\"Shining Soul II\" received \"average\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of all four eights for a total of 32 out of 40. The earliest reviews came from \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" (nearly four months prior to the game's release), \"Game Informer\" (nearly three months prior), and \"Nintendo Power\" (nearly two months prior).\n"}

Vieira, author of \"Sin in Soft Focus: Pre-Code Hollywood\" has said, \"\"Baby Face\" was certainly one of the top 10 films that caused the Production Code to be enforced.\" In 2005, \"Baby Face\" was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures to be added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress. \nLily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck) works for her father Nick (Robert Barrat) in a speakeasy in Erie, Pennsylvania during Prohibition. Since the age of 14, her father has had her sleep with many of his customers. The only man she trusts is Cragg (Alphonse Ethier ), a cobbler who admires Friedrich Nietzsche and advises her to aspire to greater things. Lily's father is killed when his still explodes. Cragg tells Lily to move to a big city and use her power over men. She and her African-American co-worker and best friend Chico (Theresa Harris) hop a freight train to New York City, but are discovered by a railroad worker who threatens to have them thrown in jail. As she unbuttons her blouse she says \"Wait ... can't we talk this over?\" It is strongly implied that she has sex with him to change his mind.\n\nIn New York, Lily goes inside the Gotham Trust building. She seduces the personnel worker to land a job. Her subsequent rise through the building symbolizes her progress in sleeping her way to the top.\n\nIn the filing department, Lily begins an affair with Jimmy McCoy Jr. (John Wayne), who recommends her for promotion to his boss, Brody (Douglass Dumbrille). She seduces Brody and is transferred to the mortgage department. Brody and Lily are caught \"in flagrante delicto\" by a rising young executive, Ned Stevens (Donald Cook). Brody is fired, but Lily claims Brody forced himself on her. Ned believes her and gives her a position in his accounting department.\n\nAlthough Ned is engaged to Ann Carter (Margaret Lindsay), the daughter of First Vice President J. P. Carter (Henry Kolker), Lily quickly seduces him. When Ann calls to say she will be visiting, Lily arranges to have Ann see her embracing Ned. Ann runs crying to her father, who tells Ned to fire Lily. He refuses, so J. P. calls Lily to his office to fire her himself. Lily claims she had no idea Ned was engaged and that he was her first boyfriend. She seduces J. P., and he installs her in a lavish apartment, with Chico as her maid. Ned tracks her down on Christmas Day, but she spurns him. He later returns to her apartment to ask her to marry him, but finds J. P. there. He shoots and kills J. P., then himself.\n\nCourtland Trenholm (George Brent), the grandson of Gotham Trust's founder and a notorious playboy, is elected bank president to handle the resulting scandal. The board of directors, learning that Lily has agreed to sell her diary to the press for $10,000, summons her to a meeting. She tells them she is a victim of circumstance who merely wants to make an honest living. The board offers her $15,000 to withhold her diary, but Courtland, seeing through her and using her claim that she simply wants to restart her life, instead offers her a position at the bank's Paris office. She reluctantly accepts. She also changes her name.\n\nWhen Courtland travels to Paris on business, he is surprised and impressed to find Lily not only still working there, but promoted to head of the travel bureau. He soon falls under her spell and marries her. Unlike her previous conquests, Courtland knows what she is, but admires her spirit nonetheless. While on their honeymoon, he is called back to New York. The bank has failed due to mismanagement, which the board unfairly pins on Courtland. He is indicted, and tells Lily he must raise a million dollars to finance his defense. He asks her to cash in the bonds, stocks and other valuables he gave her, but she refuses and books passage back to Paris.\n\nWhile waiting for the ship to leave, she changes her mind and rushes back to their apartment. When she arrives, she discovers Courtland has shot himself. She tearfully professes her love for him. On the way to the hospital, the ambulance attendant assures her that he has a good chance. Lily accidentally drops her jewelry case, spilling money and jewels on the floor. When the attendant points this out, she tearfully tells him they do not matter anymore. Courtland opens his eyes, sees Lily, and smiles at her.\n\n\nThis film was Warner Bros.' answer to MGM's \"Red-Headed Woman\" (1932) starring Jean Harlow, another pre-Code Hollywood film with a similar theme. Production head Darryl F. Zanuck wrote the treatment for the film and sold it to Warner Bros. for a dollar. The Great Depression was having a devastating effect on the film industry at the time, and many studio personnel were voluntarily taking salary cuts to help. Zanuck did not need the money because he was drawing a weekly salary of $3,500. He later left Warner Bros. and became the head of production at 20th Century Fox.\n\nAside from its depiction of a seductress, the film is notable for the \"comradely\" relationship Lily has with African-American Chico, who is her co-worker in Erie, Pennsylvania, and comes with her to New York City. She later becomes Stanwyck's maid, but their relationship remains friendly, and not that of a mistress and her servant. At one point in the film, one of her lovers urges her to \"send away that incredible colored woman\", to which Stanwyck responds, with finality, \"She stays.\"\n\nStanwyck had influence on the film's script. It was her suggestion that Lily had been forced by her father to sleep with the customers of his speakeasy.\n\n\"Baby Face\" was shot in 18 days, and cost $187,000.\n\nA publicity still from this film aptly shows Barbara Stanwyck posing next to a stepladder, representing Lily's step-by-step up the ladder of success, as she seduces one man after another.\n\nAn instrumental version of the 1926 hit song \"Baby Face\", composed by Harry Akst, is played over the opening credits and in later scenes. \"Saint Louis Blues\" by W. C. Handy is also used repeatedly. Theresa Harris (\"Chico\") sings it twice and an instrumental version is heard at the close of the final scene.\n\nAfter its initial limited release, the Hays Office recommended that the film be pulled from distribution entirely because of multiple violations of the Production Code. Extensive correspondence took place between Zanuck and Jack L. Warner of Warner Bros. and the Association of Motion Picture Producers (AMPP) about ways to make the film more acceptable to state and city censors. The primary change was to alter the ending to one which showed Lily losing everything and returning to her roots in her home town, where she is content to live a modest lifestyle, thus showing the audience that her sexual vices were not ultimately rewarded. Also, Lily's status as a \"kept woman\" was made less obvious, and the scene where she seduces a railroad worker in a boxcar, while her friend Chico is on the other side of the car, singing \"Saint Louis Blues\", was cut.\n\nAnother significant change was that the cobbler's enthusiasm for Nietzschean philosophy was replaced by his becoming the moral voice of the film, showing that Lily had been wrong wrong to use her body to succeed. The cobbler's original speech was:\n\nThe altered version, with the cobbler as the voice of morality, was:\n\nThe new lines were dubbed onto an over-the-shoulder shot of the cobbler.\n\nThe New York State Censorship Board rejected the film's original version in April 1933, and Warners made the changes described above, as well as cutting some sexually suggestive shots. In June 1933 the Board passed the revised version, which then had a successful release. The film was also initially rejected by the censorship board in Virginia.\n\nThe uncensored version remained lost until 2004, when it resurfaced at a Library of Congress film vault in Dayton, Ohio. George Willeman is credited with the discovery. The restored version premiered at the London Film Festival in November 2004. In 2005 it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected for preservation in the United States Library of Congress National Film Registry and also was named by \"Time\" magazine as one of the 100 best movies of the last 80 years. Turner Classic Movies shows the uncensored version.\n\nAccording to Warner Bros the film earned $308,000 domestically and $144,000 foreign.\n\nReviews contemporary with the film's release were not positive. Mordaunt Hall in \"The New York Times\" panned the film, calling it \"an unsavory subject, with incidents set forth in an inexpert fashion,\" while a review in \"The New York Evening Post\" said \"You cannot escape the belief that Lily is a vixen of the lowest order and that the men who play with her are doomed to perish in the flames.\"\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

It is named after computer programmer Melvin Conway, who introduced the idea in 1967. His original wording was:\nThe law is based on the reasoning that in order for a software module to function, multiple authors must communicate frequently with each other. Therefore, the software interface structure of a system will reflect the social boundaries of the organization(s) that produced it, across which communication is more difficult. Conway's law was intended as a valid sociological observation, although sometimes it's used in a humorous context. It was dubbed Conway's law by participants at the 1968 \"National Symposium on Modular Programming\".\n\nIn colloquial terms, it means software or automated systems end up \"shaped like\" the organizational structure they are designed in or designed for. Some interpretations of the law say this organizational pattern mirroring is a helpful feature of such systems, while other interpretations say it's merely a result of human nature or organizational bias.\n\nEric S. Raymond, an open-source advocate, restated Conway's law in \"The New Hacker's Dictionary\", a reference work based on the Jargon File. The organization of the software and the organization of the software team will be congruent, he said. Summarizing an example in Conway's paper, Raymond wrote:\nRaymond further presents \"Tom Cheatham's amendment\" of Conway's Law, stated as:\nYourdon and Constantine, in their 1979 book on Structured Design, gave a more strongly stated variation of Conway's Law:\nJames O. Coplien and Neil B. Harrison stated in a 2004 book concerned with organizational patterns of Agile software development:\nAn example of the impact of Conway's Law can be found in the design of some organization websites. Nigel Bevan stated in a 1997 paper, regarding usability issues in websites: \"Organisations often produce web sites with a content and structure which mirrors the internal concerns of the organisation rather than the needs of the users of the site.\"\n\nEvidence in support of Conway's law has been published by a team of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard Business School researchers who, using \"the mirroring hypothesis\" as an equivalent term for Conway's law, found \"strong evidence to support the mirroring hypothesis\", and that the \"product developed by the loosely-coupled organization is significantly more modular than the product from the tightly-coupled organization\". The authors highlight the impact of \"organizational design decisions on the technical structure of the artifacts that these organizations subsequently develop\".\n\nAdditional and likewise supportive case studies of Conway's law have been conducted by Nagappan, Murphy and Basili at the University of Maryland in collaboration with Microsoft, and by Syeed and Hammouda at Tampere University of Technology in Finland.\n\n\n"}

When a patient becomes unconscious, the muscles in the jaw commonly relax and can allow the tongue to slide back and obstruct the airway. This makes airway management necessary, and an NPA is one of the available tools. The purpose of the flared end is to prevent the device from becoming lost inside the patient's nose.\n\nAs with other catheters, NPAs are measured using the French catheter scale, but sizes are usually also quoted in millimeters. Typical sizes include: 6.5 mm/28FR, 7.0 mm/30FR, 7.5 mm/32FR, 8.0 mm/34FR, and 8.5 mm/36FR.\n\nThese devices are used by emergency care professionals such as EMTs and paramedics in situations where an artificial form of airway maintenance is necessary, but tracheal intubation is impossible, inadvisable, or outside the practitioner's scope of practice. An NPA is often used in conscious patients where an oropharyngeal airway would trigger the gag reflex.\n\nThe correct size airway is chosen by measuring the device on the patient: the device should reach from the patient's nostril to the earlobe or the angle of the jaw. The outside of the tube is lubricated with a water-based lubricant so that it enters the nose more easily. The device is inserted until the flared end rests against the nostril.\n"}

Conway coined the term \"coroutine\" in 1958 and he was the first to apply the concept to an assembly program. He later authored a seminal paper on the subject of coroutines, titled \"Design of a Separable Transition-diagram Compiler\", which included the first published explanation of the concept. In this paper, he proposed organizing a compiler as a set of coroutines, which allows using separate passes while debugging and then running a single pass compiler in production. Another famous paper is his 1958 proposal of an UNCOL, a Universal Computer Oriented Language, which attempted to provide a solution to economically produce compilers for new programming languages and computer architectures.\n\nConway wrote an assembler for the Burroughs model 220 computer called SAVE. The name SAVE was not an acronym, but a feature: programmers lost fewer punched card decks because they all had \"SAVE\" written on them.\n\nHis work on Pascal compiler for Rockwell Semiconductor (an immediate-turnaround Pascal trainer for the Rockwell AIM-65) led to an arrangement between Apple and Think Technologies (where he served as a principal) under which the latter produced the original (1984) Mac Pascal and Apple II Instant Pascal.\n\nIn the 1970s, he was involved with the MUMPS (Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System) medical programming language standard specification for the National Bureau of Standards. He also wrote a reference book on MUMPS in 1983.\n\nConway was granted a US patent in 2001 on \"Dataflow processing with events\", concerned with programming using graphical user interfaces. The patent expired in 2019.\n\nIn 2002 Conway obtained a teacher license for high school math and physics in Massachusetts. He taught at Chelsea High School until 2006.\n\n\n\n"}

The neighborhood caters to wholesale selling. With 4,000+ independently owned and operated retail and wholesale businesses, you’ll find apparel, footwear, accessories, and fabrics.\n\nPreviously known as the Garment District, the LA Fashion District was developed in the early 20th Century by mostly European immigrants who relocated their garment manufacturing businesses here. The garment district’s evolution to include retailing in addition to manufacturing and wholesale sales, began in the Santee Alley. An alley that serviced the back doors of manufacturing and wholesale businesses, these businesses would open retail outlets out their back doors for one or two days a week. These retail operations grew into 7-day a week businesses along four blocks - morphing the District into the LA Fashion Industry’s retail and wholesale mecca. \n\nOn January 2, 1996 the Garment District formally began changing the area’s name and image to the Los Angeles Fashion District courtesy of one of the City’s first BIDs (Business Improvement District). At the time the newly coined Fashion District was composed of 56 blocks and since then, has nearly doubled in size to its current span of 107 blocks. \n\nAs Los Angeles' first property-based BID, the LA Fashion District BID has pioneered a collaborative effort among area stakeholders that continues to foster a clean, safe, and vibrant environment for everyone who experiences the district.

It is the only such facility in the US, and is among nine worldwide. The lab is supported by the National Science Foundation and the state of Florida, and works in collaboration with private industry.\n\nCurrently the lab holds a world record of possessing the world's strongest magnet for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments. The 33-ton series connected hybrid (SCH) magnet broke the record during a series of tests conducted by MagLab engineers and scientists. The instrument reached its full field of 36 Tesla on 15 November 2016.\n\nIn 1989 Florida State University (FSU), Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the University of Florida submitted a proposal to the National Science Foundation (NSF) for a new national laboratory supporting interdisciplinary research in high magnetic fields. The plan proposed a federal-state partnership serving magnet-related research, science and technology education, and partnering industry. The goal was to maintain the competitive position of the US in magnet-related research and development. Following a peer-review competition, the NSF approved the FSU-led consortium's proposal.\n\nIn a competing proposal to the NSF, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), with the University of Iowa, the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and Argonne National Laboratory, had suggested improving the existing world-class Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory at MIT. On September 5, 1990, MIT researchers asked the 21 members of the National Science Board (NSB) to \"review and reconsider\" its decision. With $60 million at stake in the NSF grant, MIT stated it would phase out the Francis Bitter Lab if it lost its appeal, the first of its kind in NSF history. The request was turned down September 18, 1990.\n\nThe laboratory's early years were spent establishing infrastructure, building the facility, and recruiting faculty. The Tallahassee complex was dedicated on October 1, 1994, to a large crowd, with keynote speaker Vice President Al Gore.\n\nThe lab's mission, as set forth by the NSF, is: \"To provide the highest magnetic fields and necessary services for scientific research conducted by users from a wide range of disciplines, including physics, chemistry, materials science, engineering, biology and geology.\"\n\nThe lab focuses on four objectives:\n\nThe National MagLab promotes science education and supports science, engineering, and science teachers through its Center for Integrating Research and Learning. Programs include mentorships in an interdisciplinary learning environment. Through the Magnet Academy, the lab's website provides educational content on electricity and magnetism.\n\nThe National MagLab also conducts monthly tours open to the public, and hosts an annual open house with about 5,000 attendees. Special tour and outreach opportunities are also available to local schools. In an interview on Skepticality, Dr. Scott Hannahs said, \"If you come by on the third Saturday in February I believe we have an open house and we have Tesla coils shooting sparks and we melt rocks in the geochemistry group and we measure the speed of sound and we have lasers and potato launchers and we just have all sorts of things showing little scientific principles and stuff. We get together and we have about 5,000 people show up to come and tour a physics lab which is a pretty amazing group of people.\"\n\nThe Tallahassee laboratory at Florida State University is a 34,374 square meter (370,000 sq ft.) complex and has approximately 300 faculty, staff, graduate, and postdoctoral students. Its director is physicist Gregory Scott Boebinger. Its chief scientist is Laura Greene.\n\nThe facility contains 14 resistive magnet cells connected to a 48 megawatt DC power supply and of cooling equipment to remove the heat generated by the magnets. The facility houses several magnets, including a 45 Tesla hybrid magnet, which combines resistive and superconducting magnets. The lab's 41.4 Tesla resistive magnet is the strongest DC (continuous-field) resistive magnet in the world, and the 25 Tesla Keck magnet has the highest homogeneity of any resistive magnet.\n\nThis program serves a broad user base in solution and solid state NMR spectroscopy and MRI and diffusion measurements at high magnetic field strengths. The lab develops technology, methodology, and applications at high magnetic fields through both in-house and external user activities. An in-house made 900 MHz (21.1 Tesla) NMR magnet has an ultra-wide bore measuring 105 mm (about 4 inches) in diameter, this superconducting magnet has the highest field for MRI study of a living animals.\n\nThe Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry program is involved in instrument and technique development and applications of FT-ICR mass spectrometry. Under the leadership of director Alan G. Marshall, the program continuously develops techniques and instruments and applications of FT-ICR mass spectrometry. The program has several instruments, including a 14.5 Tesla, 104 mm bore system.\n\nThe most common form of EMR is electron paramagnetic/spin resonance (EPR/ESR). In EPR experiments, transitions are observed between the mS sublevels of an electronic spin state S that are split by the applied magnetic field as well as by the fine structure interactions and the electron-nuclear hyperfine interactions. This technique has applications in chemistry, biochemistry, biology, physics and materials research.\n\nThe Magnet Science and Technology division is charged with developing the technology and expertise for magnet systems. These magnet projects include building advanced magnet systems for the Tallahassee and Los Alamos sites, working with industry to develop the technology to improve high-field magnet manufacturing capabilities, and improving high field magnet systems through research and development.\n\nAlso at the lab's FSU headquarters, the Applied Superconductivity Center advances the science and technology of superconductivity for both the low temperature niobium-based and the high temperature cuprate or MgB-based materials. The ASC pursues the superconductors for magnets for fusion, high energy physics, MRI, and electric power transmission lines and transformers.\n\nThe in-house research program utilizes MagLab facilities to pursue high field research in science and engineering, while advancing the lab’s user programs through development of new techniques and equipment.\n\nThe condensed matter group scientists concentrate on various aspects of condensed matter physics, including studies and experiments involving magnetism, the quantum hall effect, quantum oscillations, high temperature superconductivity, and heavy fermion systems.\n\nThe geochemistry research program is centered around the use of trace elements and isotopes to understand the Earth processes and environment. The research interests range from the chemical evolution of Earth and solar system through time to local scale problems on the sources and transport of environmentally significant substances. The studies conducted by the geochemistry division concern terrestrial and extraterrestrial questions and involve land-based and seagoing expeditions and spacecraft missions. Together with FSU's Chemistry and Oceanography departments, Geochemistry has started a program in Biogeochemical Dynamics.\n\nOther programs include cryogenics, optical microscopy, quantum materials and resonant ultrasound spectroscopy.\n\nThe lab also has a materials research team that researches new ways to make high strength magnetic materials using more common and cheaper elements.\n\nLos Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico hosts the Pulsed Field Facility, which provides researchers with experimental capabilities for a wide range of measurements in non-destructive pulsed fields to 60 Tesla. Pulsed field magnets create high magnetic fields, but only for fractions of a second. A 100 Tesla multi-shot magnet is being jointly constructed by the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation. The laboratory is located at the center of Los Alamos. In 1999-2000, the facility was relocated into a new specially designed Experimental Hall to better accommodate user operations and support. The program is the first and only high pulsed field user facility in the United States.\n\nThe facility provides a wide variety of experimental capabilities to 60 Tesla, using short and long pulse magnets. Power comes from a pulsed power infrastructure which includes a 1.43 gigawatt motor generator and five 64-megawatt power supplies. The 1200-ton motor generator sits on a 4800-short ton (4350 t) inertia block which rests on 60 springs to minimize earth tremors and is the centerpiece of the Pulsed Field Laboratory.\n\nThe facility's magnets include a 60 Tesla long-pulse magnet that is the most powerful controlled-pulse magnet in the world.\n\nThe University of Florida is home to user facilities in magnetic resonance imaging or (MRI) with an ultra-low temperature, ultra-quiet environment for experimental studies in the High B/T (high magnetic field/low temperature) Facility. Facilities are also available for the fabrication and characterization of nanostructures at a new nanoscale research facility operated in conjunction with the university's Major Analytical and Instrumentation Center.\n\nThe High B/T Facility is part of the Microkelvin Laboratory of the Physics Department and conducts experiments in high magnetic fields up to 15.2 Teslas and at temperatures as low as 0.4 mK simultaneously for studies of magnetization, thermodynamic quantities, transport measurements, magnetic resonance, viscosity, diffusion, and pressure.\n\nThe facility holds world records for high B/T in Bay 1 for short term low field capabilities and world records for high field long time (> 1 week) experiments. The research group leads the world in collective studies of quantum fluids and solids in terms of breadth and low temperature techniques (thermometry, NMR, ultrasound, heat capacity, sample cooling.)\n\nThe Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy program contains facilities for the Mag Lab's NMR Program that complement the facilities at the lab's headquarters in Tallahassee. The program is located at the University of Florida's McKnight Brain Institute. Their instruments include a 600 MHz NMR magnet with 1 mm triple-resonance, high-temperature superconducting probe, which delivers the highest mass sensitivity of any probe at any frequency in the world.\n\n"}

Each player chooses one of the major powers from the 1950s/1960s era and controlled their economic and military buildup during each turn, much like Risk.\n\nThe board is an azimuthal projected map of the Earth looking down at the North Pole. Each of the six playable \"countries\" are different bright colors while unplayable regions are various shades of brown depending on their economic and military \"value\". The six countries and their colors are:\n\nUnited States (Blue),\nSoviet Union (Red),\nChina (Yellow),\nIndia (Green),\nWestern Europe (Purple), and\nSouth America (Orange),\n\nEach of the player countries are worth 10 points, while the brown regions vary from 2, 4, 6, and 8.\n\nFor the board is a small circlet holder with colored flags to remind players which countries are in alliance. This piece is largely viewed as a gimmick, though various house rules may have different uses for these pieces.\n\nEach player may build, in their captured regions, a balance of factories, mills (both square), and military bases (round).\n\nEach player is awarded every turn a number of I-Beams, red Military Threat chips, white Popular Support chips, and black Economic Pressure chips. The I-Beams are produced by a player's Mills and are used to build more Factories, Bases, and Mills. Economic Pressure chips come from the amount of Mills a player owns. Popular Support chips come from the number of Factories one owns. Military Threat chips come from the number of Bases one has.\n\nThere is also a set of cards with various situations that players must respond to. They can be as simple as gaining two I-Beams, to losing three red chips. The cards are similar to the community chest and chance cards of Monopoly.\n\nAllies are welcomed and may help struggling players get out of trouble, or create an unbeatable force that will crush the remaining weak players. Eventually though everyone must defeat their opponents to win the game. The game calls for a balance of social skills, economic knowledge, and military tactics.\n\nOne of the primary strategies of the game is to threaten an invasion by deploying one's military and economic power cards unless an opposing player dismantles their bases in one of the brown regions.

The Institute's areas of interest include Parkinson's disease, stroke, motor neurone disease, traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, addiction, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, brain development in premature babies, Huntington's disease, depression, schizophrenia, brain function in health and disease, heart failure, and dementia.\n\nAffiliated with the University of Melbourne and the Austin Hospital, the Institute is located in the Melbourne suburbs of and in Victoria. It is the largest brain research group in the southern hemisphere and employs approximately 600 staff and students. The Institute is led by its Director, Professor Steven Petrou, who specialises in the underlying electrophysiological basis of genetic childhood epilepsies.\n\nThe origins of the institute are based on the 1947 work of the founder, Dr. Derek Denton, and the investigation of the team of scientists, Prof R D Wright, Prof J P Coghlan and Prof Marelyn Wintour-Coghlan into the control of salt and water balance in health and disease.\n\nThe Institute was formally established in 1971 by the Victorian Government and named in honour of Howard Florey, an Australian Laureate of the 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine who helped to isolate the active principle of penicillin and developed the first manufacturing process for the antibiotic. The Institute conducted research into physiological control of body fluid and electrolyte balance, especially the regulation of the adrenal salt-retaining hormone, aldosterone; micro measurement of hormones; hybridization histochemistry; instincts that control ingestion; and the Relaxin hormone.\n\nPreviously known as the Howard Florey Institute of Experimental Physiology and Medicine, in 1997 the Institute’s focus broadened to encompass brain disorders. From 1997 to 2007, the neuroscientist Professor Frederick Mendelsohn AO, led the institute.\n\nOn 1 July 2007 the legislation that created the Howard Florey Institute of Experimental Physiology and Medicine was repealed, and the Florey amalgamated with the Brain Research Institute and the National Stroke Research Institute to become collectively known as the Florey Neuroscience Institutes (FNI). As part of the amalgamation process, a new research facility was constructed to house the FNI, the Mental Health Research Institute and researchers from the University of Melbourne. In 2012, with the amalgamation of the Mental Health Research Institute and the Florey Neuroscience Institutes, the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health was formed. Research now includes psychiatric conditions such as depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and on neurodegenerative illnesses, particularly Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.\n\n\n"}

Reagan High School, is a senior high school located in the Houston Heights in Houston, Texas. It serves students in grades nine through twelve and is a part of the Houston Independent School District.\n\nHeights High School is HISD's Magnet School of Computer Technology and offers the International Baccalaureate Programme (IB) Middle Years Program (till 10th grade) and twenty Advanced Placement (AP) courses. Students join one of the following academies: Computer Magnet Academy, Health Science Academy, Business Academy, Engineering and Design Academy, or Transportation Academy.\nThe current principle of Heights High school is Billy Thursland\n\nHouston Heights High School was first established for Heights residents in 1904, as an elementary through high school. Its initial site was lots 8-17 of Houston Heights Block 185, on what is now Milroy Park.\n\nWhen the Heights joined the City of Houston in 1918, the building at the end of Heights Boulevard and 20th known today as Hamilton Middle School became the Senior High School, and the old location became a Junior High School. When the original building on Yale and 12th burned in 1924, a new location for the high school was picked in the block between Oxford and Arlington, 13th and 14th. The new school was named John H. Reagan High School and opened in 1926 with the student body and teachers marching down Heights Blvd from the old school building to the new high school on 13th Street. Reagan was built on the entirety of blocks 166 and 167.\n\nThe campus was designed by John Staub and William Ward Watkin, who were designers of the original campus of Rice University. Reagan was first established as an all-white high school.\n\nOvercrowding at Reagan was relieved by Waltrip High School when Waltrip opened in 1959.\n\nReagan High was previously reserved for white children (Hispanics being categorized as white prior to 1970) but it desegregated by 1970. Its student body started to become increasingly Hispanic; by 1988 Reagan was mostly Hispanic. In 1997 a portion of the Reagan boundary was rezoned to Waltrip.\n\nIn 2006 Reagan began a renovation project. Set to end in the summer of 2007, the renovations to Reagan included the building of a new cafeteria, a new gymnasium complex, an additional academic building, a new vocational building, and a library.\n\nCirca 2006 Connie Berger became the principal of Reagan. In 2009 Berger expected around 100 former private school students to enroll because the economic conditions persuaded families to send their children to public school instead of private school.\n\nAround 2012, each year a total of 400 students transfer from Booker T. Washington High School to Reagan and Waltrip High School.\n\nThe HISD board voted to rename the school to Heights High School in 2016. In June 2016 a group of eight Houston area residents, including alumni and parents, sued HISD to get an injunction to prevent the name changes; they did so after HISD did not accept their ultimatum to stop the name changes. Wayne Dolcefino serves as their spokesperson.\n\nIn 2006 Reagan began a renovation project that included the building of a new cafeteria, a new gymnasium complex, an additional academic building, a new vocational building, and a library. \nThe school now also has an auditorium, a teaching theater, dance rooms, technology rooms, a piano lab, a choir/band hall, and a library with computers where the students can do research. It also has a two-story parking garage, an auto shop, and large track and field.\n\nIn 2012 Richard Connelly of the \"Houston Press\" ranked Reagan as the sixth most architecturally beautiful high school campus in Greater Houston. Connelly said that a coworker told him that Reagan looked like Rydell High School in \"Grease\".\n\nHealth and Science Academy: classes and shadowing at health care facilities; seniors can work entry level health positions in partnership with Ben Taub Hospital.\nBusiness Academy: classes and hands-on experience.\nMagnet Academy for Computer Technology: options include audio/video production, computer programming and digital media/web technology. The school’s A/V program is the only authorized Apple training center in the Houston area, giving students the opportunity to earn certification in Apple Final Cut Pro video editing software.\nEngineering and Design Academy – Students participate in VEX and FIRST Robotics, and have access to a NAO Humanoid Robot for programming, Markerbots 3D printers and an Arduino electronics lab.\nTransportation Academy – Students study in specialized labs designed for automotive mechanics and repair. The program is certified by NATEF and students compete in SkillsUSA competitions.\nInternational Baccalaureate – (IB) – In 2013, Reagan became an official IB World School offering the Middle Years Programme (from 6th to 10th grade) in partnership with Hogg Middle School.\n\nIn 2006 the school had 1,600 students. In 2016 it had 2,340 students.\n\n2014 was Heights High’s first year in the 6A Conference. The football team is cheered on by Bulldog Cheerleaders, the “redcoats”, and a marching band composed of about 140 students.\n\nHeights High School takes students from most of the Houston Heights neighborhood, a small portion of Downtown Houston, the Fourth Ward, East Norhill, Woodland Heights, Brooke Smith, Magnolia Grove, Stude the Old Sixth Ward, The Historic 1st Ward, and a small portion of Midtown. Other parts of Houston northwest of downtown within the 610 Loop are zoned to Heights High as well.\nOriginally, all of the Houston Heights was zoned to the school. In 1997, a small portion was rezoned to Waltrip.\n\nThe following Houston Housing Authority public housing complexes, all in the Fourth Ward, are zoned to Heights High: Historic Oaks of Allen Parkway Village, Historical Rental Initiative (30 single-family houses), and Victory Place.\n\nMiddle schools feeding into Heights High School include Gregory-Lincoln Education Center, Alexander Hamilton, and Hogg,\n\nElementary schools that feed indirectly into Heights through the above middle schools include Browning\nField\nHarvard\nCrockett\nGregory-Lincoln Education Center\nHelms\nJefferson\nKetelsen (partial)\nLove\nMemorial (partial), and Travis (partial).\n\nMagnet students must follow the HISD Magnet application process and may apply from all HISD areas.\n\nhttp://www.har.com/school/dispCampusDetail.cfm?id=101912012\n\n\n\n"}

Typical examples are ilmenite (FeTiO), a mixed oxide of iron (Fe) and titanium (Ti) cations, the mineral perovskite and oxides sharing the perovskite structure and garnet. The cations may be the same element in different ionization states: a notable example is magnetite FeO, which contains the cations Fe (\"ferrous\" iron) and Fe (\"ferric\" iron) in 1:2 ratio. Other notable examples include the ferrites, strontium titanate SrTiO (which, despite its name, contains Ti cations and not the TiO anion), yttrium aluminum garnet YAlO, and many more.\nSometimes the term is applied loosely to solid solutions of metal oxides rather than chemical compounds\n\nMixed oxides are intermediate between a metal oxide and a metal salt. Sometimes mixed oxides are the salts of weak metallic acids. Most other times they are just two different oxides that bond together strongly.\n\nHowever, the term is sometimes also applied to compounds of oxygen and two or more other elements, where some or all of the oxygen atoms are covalently bound into oxoanions.; or to fine mixtures of two or more oxides. An example would be the zincates. Zinc hydroxide can react with concentrated sodium hydroxide to become sodium zincate. This contains zincate ions.\n\nMixed oxide minerals are plentiful in nature. Synthetic mixed oxides are components of many ceramics with remarkable properties and important advanced technological applications, such as strong magnets, fine optics, lasers, semiconductors, piezoelectrics, superconductors, catalysts, refractories, gas mantles, nuclear fuels, and more. Piezoelectric mixed oxides, in particular, are extensively used in pressure and strain gauges, microphones, ultrasound transducers, micromanipulators, delay lines, etc..\n\n"}

{"id": "2285313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2285313", "title": "Consumer Credit Act 1974", "text": "Consumer Credit Act 1974\n\nThe Consumer Credit Act 1974 (c 39) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that significantly reformed the law relating to consumer credit within the United Kingdom.\n\nPrior to the Consumer Credit Act, legislation covering consumer credit was slapdash and focused on particular areas rather than consumer credit as a whole, such as moneylenders and hire-purchase agreements. Following the report of the Crowther Committee in 1971 it was decided that wide-ranging reform of consumer credit law was needed, and a bill to do this was introduced to Parliament. Despite its progress through Parliament being disrupted by a general election, the bill passed quickly through the legislative process thanks to support from both the government and the opposition, coming into law on 31 July 1974.\n\nThe Act introduces new protection for consumers and new regulation for bodies trading in consumer credit and related industries. Such traders must have full licenses from the Office of Fair Trading, which may be suspended or revoked in the event of irregularities. The Act also regulates what may be taken as security, limits the ways in which credit organisations can advertise and gives the county court the ability to intercede in the case of unfair or unjust credit agreements. It also gives additional rights to the debtor, including certain limited rights to cancel concluded agreements. The Act was amended by the Consumer Credit Act 2006.\n\nConsumer credit regulation was ignored by both Parliament and the courts for over 800 years, with the judges and Members of Parliament taking the attitude that there was no reason to interfere with fairly concluded contracts. The first piece of legislation to deal with consumer credit was the Bills of Sale Act 1854, which required bills of sale to be registered. This allowed the courts to intervene for the first time, since an unregistered bill of sale was void and could not be claimed by creditors. This act was followed by the Bills of Sale Act 1878 and the Bills of Sale Act (1878) Amendment Act 1882, which provided limited protection for debtors. Outside of these acts, however, little was done between 1854 and 1900, and moneylenders used this to their advantage, sometimes abusively; the report of the House of Commons Select Committee on Money-Lending in 1898 included testimony from one moneylender who admitted he charged 3,000% interest, while another had worked under 34 different aliases to avoid having notoriety associated with his name.\n\nAs a result of this report the Moneylenders Act 1900 was passed, which required registration for moneylenders and allowed the courts to dissolve \"unfair\" moneylending agreements. This act had two main weaknesses, however; firstly, many of the debtors who would like to sue their moneylender to have the agreement cancelled were by definition poor, and could not afford legal representation. Secondly, the Act only focused on specific types of lenders; lending by a single moneylender was covered, lending by a bank was not. In 1927 a second Moneylenders Act was passed, which required licensing as well as registration and forbade moneylenders from employing agents, canvasses or sending out unsolicited advertisements. Unfortunately the 1900 and 1927 Acts also covered commercial transactions, and since people lending money in a commercial area were not excluded as banks were, a slight infraction could make a loan completely irrecoverable. This was partially solved with the passing of the Companies Act 1967, which allowed the Board of Trade to give individual moneylenders licenses saying that they were acting as banks, not moneylenders.\n\nAs a result of the restrictions on business caused by the Moneylenders Act 1927, the idea of hire-purchase developed. These were first regulated by the Hire-Purchase and Small Debt (Scotland) Act 1932, which only covered Scotland; England and Wales was first covered by the Hire-Purchase Act 1938, later amended by the Hire-Purchase Act 1954 and the Hire-Purchase Act 1964. The 1965 Act applied to all hire-purchase agreements worth less than £2,000 and when the hirer and buyer was not a corporation.\n\nIn 1965 the Crowther Committee was established to look at the state of consumer credit law in the United Kingdom. Chaired by Lord Crowther, the Committee began sitting in December that year and eventually extended their review to cover consumer credit generally rather than just the bills of sale and moneylending they had initially been concerned with, and their report was finally published in March 1971. The report discussed the economical, social and legal aspects of consumer credit, and concluded that the existing law was so confused and unsatisfactory that it was not worth amending. Instead it recommended the complete repeal of all existing legislation and its replacement with two new acts: a Lending and Security Act, which would regulate legitimate business transactions, and a Consumer Sale and Loan Act which would regulate consumer credit and establish a licensed system for its use.\n\nThe reaction to the report from consumer and business organisations was overwhelmingly positive, but the government initially did nothing, since the Department of Trade and Industry wanted time to work out the particular details of any Acts. Their hand was eventually forced by Baroness Phillips a year later, who initiated a debate in the House of Lords on the matter. The government's official statement was that they were willing to accept almost all the recommendations made about consumer credit, they did not wish to legislate on lending and securities. In February 1973 they created a Voluntary Code which they expected those lending to observe. The Code set out guidelines for loaning money to individuals and disclosing the cost of the loan.\n\nIn September 1973 the government issued a white paper titled \"Reform of the Law on Consumer Credit\" in which they indicated they were planning to implement almost all of the Crowther Committee's consumer credit recommendations. The only real differences were an increase in the limits for financial protection from £2,000 to £5,000 (due to the drop in value of money), and stronger protection for hirers under hire-purchase agreements.\n\nThe Act was first introduced to Parliament as the Consumer Credit Bill at the beginning of November 1973, and initially ran to 96 pages. It was given its second reading on 14 November, and was welcomed by both the government and opposition.By February 1974 it had passed through the Committee Stage, but its progress was cut short by a general election in the same month. Thanks to the support of the opposition to the original bill this did not make a significant impact, and the new administration immediately reintroduced the bill in the House of Lords. It was passed on 31 July 1974, and immediately received the Royal Assent. The final version of the act contained 193 sections and 5 schedules, much larger than the original 96 pages.\n\nThe Act is divided into 12 sections, and is \"designed to provide a comprehensive code regulating the consumer credit and consumer hire fgb and almost every aspect of a credit granting operation\".\n\nThe office of Director General of Fair Trading was created by the Fair Trading Act 1973, with the Director appointed by the government for a five-year term. Consumer credit was not originally part of his duties (although the scope of his role did contain some elements of consumer credit) and the Crowther Committee had recommended the creation of a separate Consumer Credit Commissioner, something included in the original bill. When the bill was resurrected after the February 1974 general election, however, it was decided that the duties should instead be given to the Office of Fair Trading, and for this purpose a separate division (the Division of Consumer Credit) was set up within the OFT.\n\nSection 1 of the Act gives the Director General of Fair Trading the duties of administering the licensing system set up by the Act, supervising the working and enforcement of the Act and any regulations made by it and, if appropriate, enforce the Act and regulations himself. The DGFT is also tasked with advising the government about social and commercial developments within the United Kingdom, and any actions taken to enforce the Act and its orders and regulations. Section 4 of the act requires him to disseminate any appropriate information and advice about consumer credit to the people of the United Kingdom. This allows him to educate the public about consumer credit, and was intended to be conducted through organisations such as the Citizens Advice Bureau. The Director's duties under this Act overlap slightly with those given by the Fair Trading Act, but are still an expansion over his original role. The Director General is tasked with issuing licenses, and under Section 35 of the Act, the Director is required to maintain a register containing all appropriate information related to licenses and applications for licenses. The register was created on 2 February 1976, and is kept at Chancery House in London. The Enterprise Act 2002 formally substituted the Office of Fair Trading for the Director General of Fair Trading for the purposes of this Act.\n\nPart II contains definitions for many types of agreements covered by the Act. There are three main types of agreement; regulated consumer credit agreements, regulated consumer hire agreements and partially regulated agreements.\n\nA regulated consumer credit agreement is defined as an agreement between two parties, one of whom (the debtor) is an individual, and the other of whom (the creditor) is \"any other person\", in which the creditor provides the debtor with credit not exceeding £5,000 (this figure was subsequently increased to £25,000 and under the Consumer Credit Act 2006 there is no upper limit). An exception to this definition is so-called \"exempt agreements\", which are agreements made where the creditor is a land improvement company, a charity, a friendly society, a trade union, an insurance company or \"a body corporate named or specifically referred to in any public general Act\". The definition of \"agreement\" is given as any discussion which produces a legal relationship; a contract. As such the decision of courts as to whether an agreement constituted an \"agreement\" under the Act rests with English contract law, and is not discussed within the Act. In many cases this is largely academic, however, since unless one party tries to contest the existence of a contract any agreement can proceed regardless of its validity under contract law.\n\n\"Individual\" is defined as including a partnership or other unincorporated body, but not corporations registered at Companies House or created by an Act of Parliament or Royal Charter, such as the BBC. The definition also excludes \"corporations sole\", such as certain government ministers and bishops. Under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965, industrial and provident societies are considered corporate bodies and thus excluded from the Act, but friendly societies and trade unions are unincorporated and thus qualify. In contrast, however, the definition of \"person\" includes both individuals and incorporated bodies.\n\nA regulated consumer hire agreement is defined as an agreement between two bodies, one of whom (the hirer) is an individual, and the other of whom, (the owner) is a person, by which goods are loaned to the hirer for use without an option to purchase. The agreement must be \"capable of subsisting\" for longer than three months, not require the hirer to make payments of more than £5,000 total and not be an \"exempt agreement\". \"Goods\" are defined as chattels personal, with \"capable of subsisting\" simply meaning that the agreement does not restrict the time limit of use to less than three months. The agreement does not have to exceed three months, but the option to do so must be given by one party.\n\nPartially regulated agreements are those consumer hire or consumer credit agreements which are not an exempt agreement but are exempt from certain provisions of the Act. What these provisions are depends on the type of agreement; small agreements, non-commercial agreements and contracts with a foreign element.\n\nSmall agreements are defined in Section 17 of the act as regulated consumer credit agreements where the credit does not exceed £30 and regulated consumer hire agreements which do not require the hirer to pay more than £30 in fees. This does not include hire-purchase or conditional sale agreements, which do not qualify regardless of the size of credit, secure transactions and transactions where the parties have attempted to break up a transaction into multiple smaller ones worth under £30 to avoid regulation. Small agreements are exempt from almost all of Part V of the act, although they remain controlled by Part IV.\n\nThe Act is primarily aimed at commercial and professional traders, and as a result excludes non-commercial agreements. Non-commercial agreements are defined by the Act as agreements where neither the creditor nor debtor are providing the transaction for business purposes in any way. Non-commercial agreements are exempt from Part V of the Act.\n\nContracts with a foreign element would not normally be mentioned in Acts of Parliament, which are deliberately constructed to avoid giving the law extraterritorial effect. In this case, however, the Act contains provisions for contracts with a foreign element, which due to the nature of commerce are common (a credit card issued in the United Kingdom, for example, which is used on holiday in France). As a result, Section 16(5) specifically excludes contracts \"having a connection with a country outside the United Kingdom\" from the Act.\n\nThe previous Acts on commercial credit provided no mechanism to regulate and enforce the rules, and the Consumer Credit Act's licensing system was the first major regulatory process within British consumer credit law. Licenses are required to carry out a consumer credit or consumer hire business, with exceptions for local authorities and corporate bodies allowed by an Act of Parliament to carry out consumer credit business. All other bodies must apply to the Consumer Credit Licensing Branch of the Office of Fair Trading for a license.\n\nThere are two types of license given - group licenses and standard licenses.\n\nGroup licenses are issued by the Director General of Fair Trading to cover a group of people in those activities described in the license. Group licenses can be issued following an application, or simply voluntarily by the Director. Holders of a group license do not have to apply individually and are not vetted individually, and holding a group license does not prevent members from also applying for a standard license. The group licenses are intended for cases where individual screening is not in the public interest; for example, when bodies are so large and established that their reputation is without question and individual screening would take too much time. Bodies currently holding group licenses include the Law Society of England and Wales and the Law Society of Northern Ireland, both professional associations of solicitors. The Director has the ability to exclude named individuals from group licenses to prevent obvious abuse.\n\nStandard licenses are licenses issued by the Director General to an individual. It can only be provided following an application, not at the Director General's discretion like a group license, and covers certain activities in a fixed period. Initially there was no obligation to issue licenses, but an amendment to the bill in Parliament means that the Director General is required to issue a license on the application of any person, providing that person is a fit person to engage in such activities and the name he applies to be licensed under is not misleading or undesirable. The license allows an individual or a partnership to trade under those names listed on the license, and is divided into seven categories:\n\nHolders of a license are obliged to inform the Director General when there is a change made within the office of a corporate licensee, an unincorporated body or a partnership. This must be done within 21 days of the change occurring. Details of new licenses are published in the \"Consumer Credit Bulletin\", the weekly journal of the Office of Fair Trading. A license lasts for 3 years beginning with the date specified on the license, not the date of its issue. A person who engages in activities that require a license when he does not have one commits a criminal offence. In addition, those agreements he makes are considered unenforceable unless the Director General directly intercedes.\n\nA license can be terminated on the death of the licensee, the licensee becoming bankrupt, the licensee becoming a patient under the Mental Health Act 1959, a bankruptcy deal under the Bankruptcy Act 1914 in which the license is given to a trustee or a deal under the Deeds of Arrangement Act 1914 in which the licensee's license is handed to a trustee. Such provisions cover both individual, unincorporated bodies and partnerships who are license holders. These provisions do not cover corporate bodies, because following consultations the Government became aware that the liquidation and winding-up of a corporate body would pose problems with licensing, largely because the body continues to trade through a liquidator.\n\nThe Act specifically controls the way in which traders and companies seek business. Prior to this individual aspects had been controlled — advertisement by moneylenders had been strictly regulated since the Moneylenders Act 1927 — but no other aspects of consumer credit were regulated at all. While this was acceptable for large and respectable institutions, the evolution of less reputable trading organisations necessitated some kind of regulation, and the Consumer Credit Act was the first statute to provide such controls for consumer credit organisations. It covers three main areas: advertising, canvassing and quotations and the display of information. No regulations have yet been made on quotations or the display of information.\n\nThe advertising provisions apply to any advertisement published for the business carried out by the advertiser which indicates he is willing to provide credit or provide goods to be hired. \"advertisement\" is taken to mean any form of advertisement, including a publication, television or radio broadcast, the display of signs, labels or goods, the distribution of samples, circulars, catalogues or price lists or the exhibition of picture, models or films, or in \"any other way\". Previous legislation such as the Advertisements (Hire-Purchase) Act 1967 limited the definition of advertisement to visual advertisements and excluded oral communications and radio broadcasts, which are included by the Act. The test of whether an oral communication counts as an \"advertisement\" is whether or not the communication is made for drawing attention to the advertiser's business or for answering a specific enquiry without promoting the business. In \"R. v Delmayne\" [1970] 2 QB 170 the High Court of Justice decided that even replying to an enquiry can amount to an advertisement if framed in such a way that it is calculated to attract business.\n\nPart IV only applies to \"public\" advertising published to promote a business — as such circulars given to employees advertising such terms would not be considered \"advertisements\". Advertisements are not regulated by the Act if the advertiser is not involved in a consumer credit business, consumer hire business or a business in which he provides credit to individuals.\n\nUnder Part IV, the Secretary of State can make regulations limiting the form and content of advertisements covered by the Act. The regulations can also specifically include certain terms or facts, and failing to follow them constitutes an offence. The intent of these regulations is to ensure that no advertisement contains misleading information, that advertisements provide the reader with a \"reasonable picture\" of the terms and conditions and that the reader is aware that the availability and terms of credit may be affected by factors such as the age and employment of the applicant.\n\nThe Crowther Committee recommended that doorstep canvassing for loans should be completely prohibited. The original provisions in the bill were indeed extremely stringent, and caused potential problems for other businesses, but were significantly amended and now only affect the canvassing they were intended to prevent. Canvassing is defined as a situation in which an individual (the canvasser) solicits the entry of another individual (the consumer) into an agreement based on his oral representations during a visit by the canvasser to \"any place\" for the purpose of making such representations. Exceptions to \"any place\" are places where business is carried out, either permanently or temporarily, by the creditor, owner, supplier, canvasser, employer of the canvasser or the consumer. There is no requirement that the oral solicitations take place in person - they can come over the telephone, or be trying to induce another individual to convince the consumer into entering an agreement.\n\nPart V of the Act deals with four elements of entering into a credit or hire agreement; pre-contract disclosure, the formalities of entry into a regulated agreement, cancellation of a regulated agreement and its consequences and withdrawal from a prospective regulated agreement and its consequences. In some cases, specific information must be disclosed before a contract is made, with the standard provision that contracts where this is not followed are unenforceable without an order from the courts.\n\nThere are certain formalities for entry into a regulated agreement, mostly based on the documentation that must be provided. Under Section 60, the Secretary of State is required to make certain regulations covering the format that contracts must take. These regulations must ensure that the debtor is made aware of the rights and/or duties conferred on him by the agreement, the amount and rate of the total charge for credit, the protection and remedies available to him and \"any other matters which, in the opinion of the secretary of state, it is desirable for him to know about in connection with the agreement\". The Act allows the Director General of Fair Trading to waive certain requirements if it appears, on the application of a consumer credit business, that to enforce them would be impracticable.\n\nSection 61 lays out the formalities required for a regulated agreement. The terms must be found in a signed and legible document, a copy of the unsigned agreement must be supplied to the debtor or hirer, a copy of the signed document must be supplied to the debtor or hirer and a notice advising the debtor or hirer of his rights of cancellation must be included with the signed and unsigned copies. The \"signed and legible document\" is described in Section 61 as a document which contains all the prescribed terms, other than implied terms, and is, when presented to the debtor or hirer for signature, in such a state that all its terms are legible. Such a document must be in the form \"prescribed by regulations\".\n\nThe regulations in question are the 1983 Regulations (Consumer Credit (Agreements) Regulations 1983 (SI 1983/1553)). These regulations laid down specific rules regarding certain \"prescribed terms\". For example, a regulated credit agreement had to contain prescribed information about the amount of credit, the length of any fixed term loan, the amount of monthly repayments and so on. If a lender failed to comply with the prescribed regulations then the agreement would not be \"properly executed\" under section 61 and could then be challenged as \"irredeemably unenforceable\" under section 127.\n\nPart V contains several provisions relating to the cancellation of a regulated agreement and the withdrawal from a prospective regulated agreement. These are similar to those found in the Hire-Purchase Act 1965, but cover all consumer credit and consumer hire agreements rather than the hire-purchase and instalment sale agreements previously covered. The withdrawal from a prospective agreement is found primarily at common law; a party may withdraw from a prospective agreement at any point before it becomes a contract without obligations. He can withdraw the prospective agreement by notice to the other party, with the Act allowing the creditor to use credit brokers as agents for this purpose.\n\nThe right to cancel a confirmed agreement was introduced by the Hire-Purchase Act 1964, mainly to frustrate doorstep salesmen who would take advantage of an unsuspecting person and force them to sign up to an agreement, normally with misrepresentations. In the Consumer Credit Act, the right of cancellation is covered in Section 67, which allows the debtor or hirer the right to cancel an agreement if there were false oral representations made to the debtor by somebody acting for the creditor. The cancellation may be enacted by serving a notice of writing given to the creditor or an agent of the creditor within six days of the agreement being made.\n\nSection 75 protects consumers who use a credit card to pay for goods valued between £100 and £30,000 where the goods are not delivered or do not match the description given of the goods, or where the condition or functionality of the goods has been misrepresented. This section provides for credit card issuers to be jointly and severally liable along with the supplier for compliance with the contract of supply.\n\nOriginally this provision applied to payments for goods valued between £30 and £10,000. The limits were increased under the Consumer Credit (Increase of Monetary Limits) Order 1983, effective from 1 January 1984 (for the lower limit increase to £100) and 20 May 1985 (for the upper limit increase to £30,000).\n\nThe Act was the first attempt by the Government of the United Kingdom to provide coherent rules relating to the taking of securities when dealing with consumer credit. Other than the Bills of Sale Acts there had been little law on securities before this, apart from a few provisions in the Hire-Purchase Acts. The Consumer Credit Act devoted an entire part of the Act to security, mostly between debtor and creditor, with third-party rights and regulations mostly governed by common law. The Act provides the form of securities, requires certain information and documents to be supplied, controls the enforcement of securities and provides certain circumstances in which securities can be considered void.\n\n\"Security\" is defined by the Act to mean any form of mortgage, bond, indemnity, guarantee or other right provided by the debtor as \"security\" to the consumer credit or hire-purchase agreement being conducted with the creditor. This covers both \"real\" securities such as mortgages and personal securities such as bonds. The only requirement is that the security must be given at the request of the debtor. Any security must be expressed in writing, and in some cases are part of the original hire agreement. This is distinct from previous law, which required a written note of the agreement but allowed the agreement to be conducted orally.\n\nCertain other formalities must be observed; under Section 105, a security is not considered properly executed unless a document is signed on or on behalf of the debtor. This document must conform to certain regulations; the terms must be legible when it is presented to be signed, it must give all the terms and conditions other than implied terms, a copy must also be presented and if the security is provided before the regulated agreement is made, a copy of the security agreement must be given to the debtor within seven days of the regulated agreement being made. If the formalities are not complied with the security agreement becomes unenforceable without a court order. The Act does not provide for any civil or criminal sanctions for creditors who enforce the agreement without a court order, however, but it may lead to the revocation or suspension of the creditor's license.\n\nPart IX gives the courts wide powers to re-open credit deals deemed extortionate and gives them control over regulated agreements. Section 189 establishes that \"courts\" means the county court; all problems are to be brought to the county court, although certain situations relating to extortionate credit agreements can be sent to the High Court.\n\nThe courts are allowed to issue enforcement orders for cases where the contract has been infringed upon, except in situations where the contract has not been signed or the terms are not set out in the contract, in which case they are permanently unenforceable. The courts are also prohibited from making enforcement orders where the owner or creditor did not give a copy of the agreement to the debtor or hirer before the contract commenced. Other than this the court is obliged to issue such orders. There are also situations in which orders can be made even when there has been no infringement. These are when the debtor or hirer has died, to recover protected goods without the consent of a debtor and to enforce a land mortgage.\n\nThe courts can also make \"time orders\" providing for either payment by the debtor of any sum owed to the creditor, remedying any breach of the agreement by the debtor other than non-payment of money or both. These orders are made at the discretion of the courts after an application for an enforcement order. The time orders can also cover statutory bailment in the case of hire-order or hire-purchase agreements. If the court feels that the property in dispute or acting as security is at risk of damage or deprecation, they can give protection orders preventing the use of the property. This re-enacts Section 35 of the Hire-Purchase Act 1965, which was repealed by the Consumer Credit Act.\n\nOther orders are \"special orders\", covered by Section 133 of the Act. There are two types; return orders and transfer orders. Return orders are orders from the court requiring the return of goods covered by the agreement to the creditor. These orders may be immediate or subject to a delay, and may give the debtor the option to pay the goods value to the creditor if he does not return the goods in time. Transfer orders are orders transferring the creditor's ownership of certain goods to the debtor, ordering the payment of the rest of the goods to the creditor. This can only be done if the debtor pays an amount of money equal or more than one third of the value of the returned goods.\n\nThe courts have long held equitable jurisdiction to set aside \"harsh and unconscionable bargains\", but prior to the Consumer Credit Act this was mainly used in cases where uninformed tradespeople have been selling goods at a loss, and was rarely used in the 20th century. The Moneylenders Act 1900 allowed the court to re-open a moneylending transaction if there was evidence that interest rates were \"harsh and unconscionable or otherwise such that a court of equity would give relief\", unless the moneylender could justify the rates. It was rarely used in the field of consumer credit because it was limited to those sorts of consumer transactions covered by the Moneylenders Act, and did not cover hire-purchase agreements or instalment sale agreements or loan transactions from people who were not moneylenders, such as banks.\n\nThe Consumer Credit Act provided guidelines for the court in determining whether a credit bargain is extortionate and extends the court’s jurisdiction in this area to cover all credit agreements. If the court does believe the bargain was extortionate, it can re-open the agreement and examine the terms of it. If they decide it is indeed extortionate, they can set aside the remaining money owed, order the creditor to give money to the debtor, alter the terms of the agreement or order the return of any security. This only covers consumer credit agreements, not hire agreements.\n\nAn ancillary credit business is defined in Section 145 of the Act as any business that works in credit brokerage, debt adjusting, debt collecting, debt counselling or as a credit reference agency.\n\nCredit brokers are people involved in negotiating deals between potential debtors looking for credit and creditors, normally in exchange for a commission. Under the Act, \"credit broker\" includes not only mortgage brokers and loan brokers but also car dealers, shops that introduce customers to financial houses for hire-purchase agreements and solicitors who negotiate advances for non-corporate clients. An exception to this is if introductions and negotiations are not made in the individual's capacity as an employee of a business.\n\nDebt adjusting is when a company or individual negotiates with the creditor or owner in an agreement on behalf of the debtor to change the terms for the discharge of the debt, takes over the debt in exchange for payment by the debtor or engages in \"any similar activity concerned with the liquidation of a debt\". This is again a wide area; the base definition covers, for example, solicitors and accountants who act as negotiators for clients who owe money to a third party. There are certain exceptions; a solicitor negotiating for the settlement of his client's debts is not considered to be working as a debt adjuster thanks to Section 146 of the Act, which excludes \"a solicitor engaging in contentious business\" as defined in the Solicitors Act 1957.\n\nDebt counselling is the giving of advice to debtors or hirers about the liquidation of debts under consumer credit or consumer hire agreements. This covers any debt counsellor, regardless of if it is free legal advice; as a result the Citizens Advice Bureau, for example, is considered a debt counsellor, although its advisers are covered by a group license. Debt collectors are covered by similar provisions, and are defined as anybody who takes steps to \"procure payment of debts due\" under consumer credit agreements and consumer hire agreements. Those who \"purchase\" debts and attempt to collect on them are covered by this definition.\n\nExceptions for these definitions are provided under Section 146 if the credit broker, debt adjuster, debt counsellor or debt collector is the creditor or owner under the credit agreement, the supplier under the agreement, a credit broker who has acquired the business of the supplier or somebody expressly excluded from certain definitions, such as a solicitor. The provisions for suppliers only come into effect when the credit is a loan, so that the supplier and creditor are different people. The exceptions do not include people who \"buy\" the roles above by purchasing the debts, such as professional debt buyers or financial houses.\n\nCredit reference agencies are covered separately from other ancillary credit businesses, and are defined in Section 148 as individuals or companies which carry on a business \"comprising the furnishing of persons with information relevant to the financial standard of individuals, being information collected by the agency for that purpose\". This definition was the subject of much academic debate, because the holding of the license for a credit reference agency involves a duty to supply information on credit status which the company might prefer to keep confidential. There are exceptions; the information must be collected for the purpose of giving it to others, so the fact that a bank, for example, has that information, does not mean they need to obtain a license as a credit reference agency.\n\nPart III of the Act applies directly to ancillary credit businesses, who must obtain a license. As with standard credit agreements, agreements made by an unlicensed ancillary trader are only enforceable against the other party if the Director General of Fair Trading issues an order which applies to the agreement. Under Section 149, creditors have an onus to make sure that the credit brokers they obtain business from are duly licensed. Again, if the broker is unlicensed, the agreement between the debtor and creditor is only enforceable when the Director General makes an order saying so. These provisions came into effect on 1 July 1978.\n\nPart IV of the Act also applies to ancillary credit businesses in relation to advertising, canvassing and quotations, as well as ways in which business can be sought. The Act also limited the brokerage fees that credit brokers can charge. Under Section 155, if the brokerage work does not lead to the client entering into an agreement with a creditor within 6 months of the work, the entire fee (minus the sum of £1) is refundable to the client. The Director General at the time indicated that those businesses which flouted Section 155 would be refused a license. These provisions came into force on 1 April 1977.\n\nSome elements of the Act came into force on 31 July 1974, the day it was passed, but many were left to be brought in later at the discretion of the government. This process was \"painfully slow\", with almost nothing apart from the licensing system being active in 1979. Section 141, which requires enforcement actions of a regulated credit or linked transaction to be pursued in the county court, came into force on 19 May 1985 through the statutory instrument \"Consumer Credit Act 1974 (Commencement No. 8) Order 1983\". The Act repealed the Hire-Purchase Act 1965, the Advertisements (Hire Purchase) Act 1967, the Moneylenders Act 1900, the Moneylenders Act 1927, the Pawnbrokers Act 1872 and the Pawnbrokers Act 1960. The Act was influential outside the United Kingdom, and was studied in both the United States and the Commonwealth of Nations. It formed the basis of a 1979 Directive on Consumer Credit of the European Union.\n\nThe Act did not go to the full extent suggested by the Crowther Committee's report, with protection only being available for consumers, not for the credit industry.\nThe Act was widely supported by all sides of the political spectrum, and by academia. Arthur Rogerson compared it to the Law of Property Act 1925 in that, like the 1925 Act, it \"represents fundamental rethinking of an area of great economic significance, which has resulted in the sweeping away of a chaos of obsolete rules, and the substitution for them of a simpler and better enforced body of law\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

A city park, Elysian Park, and Dodger Stadium are within the neighborhood, as are a Catholic high school and an elementary school.\n\nOn August 2, 1769, the Portolá expedition (the first Europeans to see inland areas of California) camped close to the Los Angeles River near what is now the southeastern corner of the city park. California Historical Landmark #655 (Portolá Trail Campsite) is at the park's Meadow Road entrance.\n\nAccording to the Mapping L.A. project of the \"Los Angeles Times\", the Elysian Park neighborhood is flanked on the north and northeast by Elysian Valley, on the east by Lincoln Heights, on the southeast and south by Chinatown and on the southwest, west and northwest by Echo Park. Street and other boundaries are: the northern apex at Exit 138 of the Golden State Freeway, thence southeasterly along the freeway, southerly along the Los Angeles River, westerly along North Broadway, northwesterly along Stadium Way, Academy Road and northerly along Elysian Park Drive.\n\nThe 2000 U.S. census of the Elysian Park neighborhood counted 2,530 residents in its 1.65 square miles, which includes all the city park land as well as Dodger Stadium—an average of 1,538 people per square mile, one of the lowest population densities in Los Angeles county. In 2008 the city estimated that the population had increased to 2,659. The median age for residents was 31, about average for Los Angeles; the percentage of residents aged 11 to 18 were among the county's highest.\n\nThe neighborhood was moderately ethnically diverse. The breakdown was Latinos, 47.6%; Asians, 43.4%; whites, 3.1%; blacks, 2.1%, and others, 3.7%. China (32.3%) and Mexico (27.3%) were the most common places of birth for the 54.4% of the residents who were born abroad, a high figure compared to rest of the city.\n\nThe median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $28,263, low for Los Angeles; a high percentage of households had an income of $20,000 or less. The average household size of 3.1 people was high for the city of Los Angeles. Renters occupied 81.9% of the housing stock, and house- or apartment owners 18.1%.\n\nThirteen percent of the neighborhood residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, an average figure for the city.\n\nThe schools operating within the Elysian Park neighborhood borders are:\n\n\nAt Solano Avenue Elementary School, things are done right. Parents chip in, teachers stick around for years, children learn, and the surrounding community claims it for their own. The campus is a thing of pride-no graffiti or trash problems here.\n\nThe park is one of largest in Los Angeles at 600 acres (2.4 km²). It is also the city's oldest park, founded in 1886 by the Elysian Park Enabling Ordinance. It hosted shooting as well as the shooting part of the modern pentathlon event for the 1932 Summer Olympics. In 1964 the Citizens Committee to Save Elysian Park was founded to prevent the City of Los Angeles from constructing the Municipal Convention Center on of park land.\n\nIn 1968, it hosted a hippie \"Love-In.\"\n\nThe Figueroa Street Tunnels take northbound State Route 110 (the Pasadena Freeway) through the park.\n\nSolano Canyon is a canyon within Elysian Park and also the name of a residential district at the southern extremity of the Elysian Park neighborhood, directly north of the Los Angeles State Historic Park. The district is bisected near its southern tip by the Arroyo Seco Parkway, and it shares a border with Chinatown (Los Angeles).\n\nSolano Canyon was also an old name for a ravine in the Hollywood Hills that was later named Runyon Canyon.\n\n\n"}

He is the nephew of Bal Thackeray; and a cousin of Shiv Sena chief and the 19th Chief Minister of Maharashtra Uddhav Thackeray.\n\nRaj Thackeray's given name is a hypocorism of Swaraj. His parents were Shrikant Thackeray (younger brother of Bal Thackeray) and Kunda Thackeray (younger sister of Bal Thackeray's wife Meena Thackeray). As a child he learnt tabla, guitar and violin. Thackeray is a graduate of Mumbai's Sir J.J. Institute of Applied Art Upon graduation he joined \"Marmik\", the weekly magazine of Bal Thackeray, as a cartoonist.\n\nRaj Thackeray resigned from his uncle's party in January 2006 and announced his intention to start a new political party. On 9 March 2006 in Mumbai, Thackeray founded \"Maharashtra Navnirman Sena\" party. At the time of the party's foundation, Thackeray stated that he does not want to have hostilities with his uncle who \"was, is and always will be(his) mentor\".\n\nIn February 2008 Raj Thackeray led a violent movement against the dominance of migrants from the North Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in Maharashtra and more so in its commercial capital of Mumbai.\n\nHis party and Shiv Sena banned Australian cricketers participating in IPL 3 from playing in Mumbai as a protest against the attack on Indian students in Australia. At a rally in Shivaji Park, Raj warned that if the \"dadagiri\" (intimidating dominance) of these people (North Indians) in Mumbai and Maharashtra continued, he would be compelled to make them leave the metropolis. Raj was arrested along with a Samajwadi Party leader, Abu Azmi, but was released on paying a penalty of .\n\nIn July 2008, Raj issued a public warning that shops in Mumbai needed to have Marathi signboards in addition to the existing English signboards. He warned that after one month, MNS workers would start blackening non-Marathi signboards. While there had been a law to this effect passed earlier by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, it had not been enforced. In September 2008, MNS workers resorted to blackening signboards, to enforce the demand, after which most shop owners complied. Six MNS workers were arrested but later released on bail.\n\nJaya Bachchan, veteran actor and MP of Samajwadi Party, during the Music launch of the Hindi film Drona, said 'Hum UP (Uttar Pradesh) ke log hain, isliye Hindi mein baat karenge, Maharashtra ke log Maaf Kijiye' (We are people of UP, so we will speak in Hindi. People of Maharashtra, please excuse). Thackeray commented that she had no business alluding to all the people of Maharashtra in that statement. He threatened to ban all Bachchan films unless Jaya apologised in a public forum for hurting Maharashtrians. MNS workers began to attack theatres featuring films affiliated to her.It was only after Amitabh tendered an apology that the screening resumed. Following Raj's threat, Maharashtra Police acted against Raj, issuing a gag order preventing him from speaking to the media.\n\nIn October 2008, Jet Airways laid off 800 temporary workers and announced layoffs of an additional 1100 workers. The laid-off workers included Marathi as well as North-Indians. Thackeray was asked to intervene. Following this, Raj Thackeray declared that most of these workers had paid security deposits to the company, and he would meet Jet management to plead their case. Unless Jet Airways cancelled the layoffs, his party would not allow any Jet Airways plane to take off from any airport in Maharashtra. Within 12 hours of Raj Thackeray's declaration, Jet chairman Naresh Goyal reversed the layoffs and reinstated the sacked employees. He said that he did it on his own and that there was no political pressure on him.\n\nOn 2 October 2009, MNS workers disrupted the screening of the film Wake Up Sid on its release in a few Pune and Mumbai theatres, after Raj objected to references in the movie to \"Bombay\" rather than \"Mumbai\". The city of Mumbai was referred to as \"Bombay\" in many scenes and in some songs (lyrics by Javed Akhtar).\nThe film's producer, Karan Johar, visited Raj's residence to apologise, and agreed to all of Raj's terms, including an apology on each of the 700 frames in the film.\n\nTelecom companies in Maharashtra had been providing customer service in English & Hindi only.\nRaj demanded that all telecom companies operating in Maharashtra start providing the service in Marathi also and set a deadline of 27 February 2010, after which his party MNS would launch an agitation.\nFollowing this demand, all telecom companies complied, introducing Marathi as an additional option in their customer service.\n\nIn Dec 2011, Raj Thackeray meeting a group from MES (Maharshtra Ekikaran Samiti) advised them that they should revisit their stand of merging Belgaum with Maharashtra in the interest of Marathi speaking people of Belgaum. In a major departure from the earlier held stand of traditional right wing groups of Maharashtra, Raj Thackeray pointed out that a practical approach rather than an emotional one is the need of the hour. However, he advocated that if the supreme court itself gives a decision in favour of Belgaum's merger, he would welcome it but the local situation in belgaum should not be vitiated for the sake of it. He asked the MES leaders to first identify the real issue as to whether marathis in belgaum are being targeted for espousing the cause of Marathi language or because they were supporting the merger of Belgaum with Maharashtra. Lamenting that strikes and bandhs only add to the misery of the Marathi-speaking community in Belgaum, Thackeray said: \"If the Karnataka government is ready to respect the Marathi people, their culture and language, then there is nothing wrong in Belgaum being there.\" His comments were strongly criticised by his cousin Uddhav as a cruel joke on the Marathi manoos.\n\nRaj Thackeray and his party, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, state that Maharashtra State, Marathi language and Marathi \"Manoos\" are subverted by the influence of Marathi politicians. He has opposed immigration into Maharashtra from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.\n\nRaj reproached North Indian leaders for politicising Chhath Puja, a festival popular in eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Jharkhand calling it a \"drama\" and a \"show of numerical strength\". He stated that the Chhath Puja was a political gimmick by some parties to attract the north Indian vote. He demanded that they only celebrate Maharashtra day and not it in Maharashtra. A petition was filed in the Patna civil court on 8 February against him for his remarks. His statements were criticised from political leaders, especially those from the North Indian states. He accused migrants of swamping Maharashtra, India's most industrialised state, in search of jobs. The MNS chief also accused migrants of disrespecting the local culture. In 2008, expressing his stance on new migrants settling in Mumbai, Raj said, \"New immigrants to the city should be denied entry into the city, while those already staying here should show respect to the Marathi 'manoos' and his culture\".\n\nThackeray and his party have been criticised for use of violence during their agitations, especially directed towards immigrants from UP and Bihar. On use of violence, Thackeray says that violence is a part of all agitations in Indian politics, and there are several cases of much more violence carried out by other parties and organisations. According to him, the incidences of violence involving members of his party have been unduly highlighted by North Indian politicians and journalists.\n\nThackeray had initially praised former Chief Minister of Gujarat and incumbent Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi for his governance, and the development of Gujarat during his tenure as chief minister. He had also expressed support for Modi for the post of Prime Minister for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Although later on, he regretted his support for Modi and since then has been a vocal critic of him and the NDA government.For the 2019 elections to the Loksabha, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, did not contest any seats, and instead Raj Thakeray urged the party supporters to vote for the NCP–Congress alliance, with Thakeray campaigning for candidates belonging to these parties.\n\nThackeray-led MNS criticised the centre's move to award the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award in India, to Adnan Sami, claiming that Sami was not an original Indian citizen.\n\nRaj is married to Sharmila Wagh, daughter of Marathi cinema photographer, producer-director Mohan Wagh. They have one son and one daughter.\n"}

He was the brother of King Ferdinand III of Castile and León, and father of Queen Maria of Molina, wife of King Sancho IV. He became Lord of Molina and Mesa after his first marriage to Mafalda González de Lara, the heiress of those lands.\n\nAlfonso was the son of King Alfonso IX of León and his second wife, Queen Berengaria of Castile. On his father's side he was the grandson of King Ferdinand II of León and his first wife, Urraca of Portugal. On his mother's side his grandparents were King Alfonso VIII of Castile and his wife, Eleanor of England. His siblings included King Ferdinand III of Castile and León, Berengaria, Constance, and Eleanor.\n\nAlfonso was born near the city of León in 1202. As the son of Alfonso IX of León and Berengaria of Castile, he witnessed the bad relations between the two kingdoms during his childhood, after the annulment of his parents' marriage. At the Battle of Navas de Tolosa (1212), his father and the King of Portugal were the only kings from the Iberian Peninsula who did not take part, in contrast to those of Castile, Aragon, and Navarre. In fact, Alfonso IX took advantage of the absence of his cousin Alfonso VIII to invade Castile.\n\nIn 1222 Ferdinand III found himself at odds with Gonzalo Pérez de Lara, Lord of Molina, due to the latter's support of Alfonso IX. But the two kings managed to come to terms, ratifying the Treaty of Zafra in 1223. Berengaria played an active role in the negotiations. The aim of Gonzalo's martial actions, including the devastation of some villages near Medinaceli, was to foment an uprising of Castilian nobles against Ferdinand in support of his father.\n\nFerdinand was now bitterly opposed to the autonomy enjoyed by Gonzalo and his family, the House of Lara, one of the most powerful in the realm alongside that of Haro. He laid siege to the Castle of Zafra, where Gonzalo took refuge with his retainers and family. Gonzalo ultimately surrendered and accepted the conditions imposed on him. The first of these was that the Lordship of Molina would not, upon his death, pass to Gonzalo's son, Pedro González de Lara \"the Disinherited\", but rather to his daughter Mafalda González de Lara, who would meanwhile marry infante Alfonso de Molina. Thus the Crown would establish control over the Lordship of Molina. The Treaty of Zafra was the prelude to the future annexation of the Lordship of Molina by the Crown of Castile. Pedro Gonzalez de Lara \"the Disinherited\" left for the Kingdom of Aragon and always considered himself the legitimate lord of Molina. In his last will, executed in 1268, he bequeathed the lordship to infante Fernando de la Cerda, the first-born son of King Alfonso X of Castile.\n\nThe marriage between Alfonso of Molina and Mafalda González de Lara took place in 1240, and upon the death of Mafalda's father, Gonzalo Pérez de Lara, infante Alfonso, through his wife, became Lord of Molina in 1243 and governed the lordship for the rest of his life, at first jointly with his wife, and then, after her death, alone, just as stipulated in the marriage contract. He, and later his daughter Blanca, expanded the provisions of the fueros of the Lordship of Molina.\n\nAccording to contemporary chroniclers, Alfonso of Molina was a man possessed of considerable virtues as well as a calm temperament. In 1230, on the death of his father Alfonso IX, he could have sought the throne of León, since Alfonso IX did not wish to bequeath it to his other son Ferdinand III, who was already King of Castile. In fact Alfonso IX named as his heirs his two daughters, infantas Sancha and Dulce. However, thanks to a substantial financial compensation, they renounced the throne of León in the Treaty of Benavente, ratified with Ferdinand in the presence of the many magnates and prelates of the realm. Alfonso of Molina, who had previously refused the throne, was rewarded by the king with his favor, with distinctions, and with many gifts, lands, and privileges. He accompanied his brother on most of his military campaigns and was closely identified with the cause of the Reconquista as well as whatever enterprises the king might undertake.\n\nIn 1231, while he visited the main cities of León after having taken possession of it, Ferdinand reportedly sent his son Infante Alfonso, then nine years of age and living in Salamanca, to lay waste to the Almohad Caliphate territories around Córdoba and Seville, accompanied by Álvaro Pérez \"the Castilian\" de Castro and the magnate Gil Manrique. Nevertheless, various historians have indicated that the infante Alfonso to which contemporary chronicles refer was not the king's son, but rather his brother, Alfonso of Molina. But according to the version which holds that the infante Alfonso present at the Battle of Jerez was actually King Fernando III's son, \"he sent Don Alvar de Castro, the Castilian, to go with him, to watch over the infante and as commander of the army, for the infante was very young and not yet so energetic, and Don Alvar Pérez was a respected and very energetic man.\"\n\nFrom Salamanca, and passing through Toledo where they were joined by 40 knights, they made their way toward Andújar. From there, they began to devastate the countryside around Cordoba, and later the provincial town of Palma del Río. They exterminated all the inhabitants and seized the town, then proceeded toward Seville and Jerez de la Frontera, and camped there near the Guadalete River. Emir Ibn Hud, who had gathered a large army of seven divisions, positioned himself between the Castilians and Jerez, forcing them to give battle. During the subsequent engagement, known as the Battle of Jerez, the Castilians defeated Ibn Hud in spite of his numerical superiority. Later, King Alfonso X referred to the 1231 battle as follows: \"It is fitting that you who are hearing this story know that the thing in the world that most broke the Moors, why they had to lose Andalusia and the Christians gain it from them, was this battle of Jerez. That is how the Moors were shattered. They could never again muster the daring nor the effort which they had previously against the Christians, such was the level of the shock and fear they experienced on that occasion.\"\n\nAfter his victory in the Battle of Jerez, Álvaro Pérez de Castro the Castilian returned to Castile and handed Infante Alfonso over to his father the king, who was in Palencia.\n\nIn 1236 Alfonso of Molina distinguished himself in the conquest of Cordoba, the old capital of the Caliphate of Cordoba. Twelve years later, in 1248, he took part in the siege of Seville and captured the Torre de Oro. He also occupied a part of the Álcazar of Seville, which was known as the \"Walls of the Infante of Molina\".\nIn the division of the territory of Seville proclaimed on 1 May 1253, almost a year after the death of his brother Ferdinand III and during the reign of his nephew Alfonso X, Infante Alfonso of Molina received large grants and was one of the greatest beneficiaries of the land distribution due to his status as younger brother of Ferdinand III. The late king had asked his son Alfonso X in his will to hold him in high regard.\n\nIn 1254 he entered the Order of Calatrava, obliged to wear their habit and assured that on his death his body would be buried in the order's main monastery. He attended the Valladolid Cortes of 1258, whose main purpose was to obtain money to fund Alfonso X's designs on the throne of the Holy Roman Empire. He also attended the Toledo Cortes of 1259, whose purpose was the same, and the Jerez Council of 1268. He attended the wedding of Infante Fernando de la Cerda, first-born son and heir of Alfonso X, to Blanche of France, held in Burgos on 30 November 1269.\n\nIn his 1254 will, made at the time he entered the Order of Calatrava, Alfonso of Molina stipulated that he be buried in the church of the castle of Calatrava la Nueva, headquarters of the order, located in what is today Ciudad Real province.\n\nAlfonso of Molina died in Salamanca on 6 January 1272 at the age of 70. Alfonso's body was provisionally buried in the monastery of San Francisco in Salamanca, which is no longer extant. Later, his remains were transferred to Calatrava la Nueva as specified in his will, and placed in a sumptuous sepulchre which lay under an arch in the main chapel of the monastery's church. This sepulchre and his remains have not survived to the present day.\n\nAlfonso of Molina married, in 1240, Mafalda González de Lara, Lady of Molina, daughter of Gonzalo Pérez de Lara, 3rd Lord of Molina and Mesa, and his wife, Sancha Gómez de Trava. They had two children:\n\nIn 1244, widowed of his first wife, he married his second, Teresa González de Lara, daughter of Count Gonzalo Núñez de Lara, Lord of Belorado, and his wife María Díaz I de Haro. They had a daughter:\n\n\nHe married, in 1260 as this third wife, Mayor Alfonso de Meneses (c. 1230 – after 1265), Lady of Meneses and Villanueva, widow of Gonzalo Gil of Villalobos and daughter of Alfonso Téllez de Meneses \"\"el Mozo\"\", 4th Lord of Meneses, San Román and Villanueva, and his first wife María Yáñez de Lima. They had two children:\n\n\nAlfonso of Molina also had several illegitimate children from various extramarital relationships:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2285338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2285338", "title": "All Star Baseball", "text": "All Star Baseball\n\nAll Star Baseball is one of the two most popular baseball board games of the last sixty years, and has been honored as one of the fifty most influential American board games of all time. It was manufactured by Cadaco-Ellis and designed by baseball player Ethan Allen.\n\nThe game first appeared in 1941 and a special version is still sold today. It was the best-selling baseball board game of all time, and is the only such game to have been distributed through mass market channels and toy stores for any extended period of time. The annual versions of the game were discontinued in the mid-1990s due to the loss of market share to video games and greatly increased player licensing costs, but a commemorative version was issued in 2003.\n\nUnlike more simulation-focused competitors, most notably Strat-o-Matic Baseball, \"ASB\" is aimed at a younger audience and is simpler to play. The initial target audience was boys 9–12 years old. It simulates batters' performance well, but makes no attempt to model the performance of individual pitchers.\n\nNevertheless, many fans passionately bought each year's cards and collected statistics from neighborhood leagues, some amassing as many as 2,500 games worth of paper box scores and comparing those totals with the actual players' statistics.\n\nThe game board for \"ASB\" has two spinners on top of a diagram of a baseball field. A hole for a baserunner peg is cut at the location of each base. A cardboard back panel is inserted into cut-out slots in the board, displays the key to the game cards and cardboard wheels that can be turned to display the correct inning, the number of outs and the score.\n\nEach circular player card has a series of lines and numbers arranged in a circle around its center. The card is placed on a spinner, which the batting player spins. (Aficionados would spin the metal pointers with rubber bands to avoid blisters.) Once the spinner came to rest between two lines, the number for that section defined what happened to that batter.\n\nIf one or more runners were on base, the pitching player would spin the other spinner, which displayed zones that defined whether runners advanced, scored or were out on the play.\n\nSome special plays, as well as attempted steals, required the use of two special pink situation cards, which went on the pitching player's spinner and indicated the result when spun.\n\nThere were no pitching cards nor fielding cards, although pitchers' batting statistics were present on their cards. This made the game inherently less mathematically accurate than its older-audience rivals.\n\nThe chart for the meaning of each number on the cards is below. The earliest versions of \"ASB\" utilized this list:\n\nLater versions featured a simpler chart, augmented by second spins on the fielding player's side (presumably to give that player more to do), with only the \"3\" section fundamentally changed:\n\nFor the 1975 release, the batting chart was reduced to the eight possible results:\n\nAll other rules of the game match those of regular baseball.\n\nUntil about 1980 \"ASB\" had a mix of current Major League stars and Hall of Fame players. As more athletes (and their estates) asserted licensing rights over the use of their names the old-time players were dropped from the game, although a handful of individuals were included occasionally in an annual set.\n\nEach of the then current players were asked to sign off on a release form granting permission to include their batting statistics in the game. This practice continued for almost 50 years after the introduction of the game. Although a few declined, most agreed despite the fact that they were not compensated for being included.\n\nIn 1995 the game came under the MLBPA license, which made the design of the game cards more sophisticated but also added significantly to the cost of production. Since the change in its business model to absorb the MLBPA royalties Cadaco has stopped issuing regular annual updates to the game, and its publishing future remains unclear.\n\nAlthough numbers have varied, the typical \"ASB\" boxed set contained 40 player cards for early sets, and 63 player cards for later sets.\n\nDuring most of its history \"ASB\" has had annual updates of its boxed board game with new players and updated stats. During some eras Cadaco-Ellis has also sold older cards by mail, and in recent years the cards have become popular on eBay.\n\nAs part of the special 2003 commemorative version, Cadaco also issued separate individually packaged sets of player cards for an All-Star Player Pack, the 2003 Ultimate Series (New York Yankees vs. Florida Marlins) and the 2003 Fantasy Series (Boston Red Sox vs. Chicago Cubs). These held action photos to further identify them as being collectible baseball cards.\n\nThere is a significant collectors market for older cards, which are broken down into several eras (all years are approximate) as printing technology evolved:\n\nThe published 1941 game was considered only a first draft. In 1975, Cadaco did try a version with 8 categories instead of 14, but the cards were already collected by dedicated players and the re-design was abandoned by Cadaco. Despite the increases in complexity, the game was intended for boys, not adults.\n\n\n"}

Lewis and written by Dwight V. Babcock, Martin Berkeley. It is based on a story written by Aubrey Wisberg. The drama features Steven Geray, Micheline Cheirel, Eugene Borden, among others.\n\n\"So Dark the Night\" is the story of a detective, Henri Cassin (Steven Geray) from Paris, who, while on a long overdue vacation, falls in love with innkeeper Pierre Michaud's daughter Nanette (Micheline Cheirel). She is a country girl with a jealous boyfriend. Nonetheless, the detective becomes engaged to her. Then, the night of her engagement party, the girl vanishes and later turns up dead. Cassin believes that the obvious suspect is Leon (Paul Marion), the old boyfriend, but soon he is also found killed. Soon after Mama (Ann Codee) receives a warning that she will be the next to die, she is found strangled.\n\nPierre, fearing for his safety, decides to sell the inn. Henri returns to Paris and, because of his investigative skill, he is able to come up with a sketch of the killer by expanding and elaborating on information provided by a footprint found beside Leon's body.\n\nTo Henri's astonishment, the sketch bears the exact likeness of himself, and when he fits his shoe into the footprint, he realizes that he is undoubtedly the killer. After making a full confession to the police commissioner, Henri is evaluated by a psychiatrist, who determines that he is schizophrenic. Though placed under watch of a guard, Henri escapes back to St. Margot, where he tries to strangle Pierre. However, the police commissioner, who has followed Henri to the village, catches the detective in the act and shoots him.\n\n\nThe critic Karl Williams called the film, \"[A] well-plotted and executed film noir [which] suffered from its lack of star power, but has become something of a cult classic.\"\n\nThe staff at \"Variety\" magazine gave the film a positive review, writing, \"Around the frail structure of a story [by Aubrey Wisberg] about a schizophrenic Paris police inspector who becomes an insane killer at night, a tight combination of direction, camerawork and musical scoring produce a series of isolated visual effects that are subtle and moving to an unusual degree.\"\n\nThe critic Dennis Schwartz lauded the film and wrote, \"This is Joseph H. Lewis's second feature and one that has the same intense energy as his \"The Big Combo\" (1955) and \"My Name is Julia Ross\" (1945). The Freudian story is wacky and strains credibility, but the elegant style Lewis uses is mesmerizing. The film noir's light touches are magnificently caught in the rich depiction of rural life and the character study of a psychological breakdown due to a pressured psyche that induces schizophrenia. This makes for a fascinating watch. \"So Dark the Night\" is a rarely shown obscure film, and it is a beauty. Burnett Guffey used his camera effectively in many strange angled shots while his dark black shadings express the contrasting somber mood to the airy country landscape.\"\n\nThe film was released on Blu-ray in 2019 by Arrow Films in the UK and Eire.\n\n"}
{"id": "2285363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2285363", "title": "Phenylpiracetam", "text": "Phenylpiracetam\n\nPhenylpiracetam (INN: fonturacetam, brand names Phenotropil Фенотропил, Carphedon), is a phenylated analog of the drug piracetam. It was developed in 1983 as a medication for Soviet Cosmonauts to treat the prolonged stresses of working in space. Phenylpiracetam was created at the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Biomedical Problems in an effort led by psychopharmacologist Valentina Ivanovna Akhapkina (Валентина Ивановна Ахапкина). In Russia it is now available as a prescription drug. Research on animals has indicated that phenylpiracetam may have anti-amnesic, antidepressant, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and memory enhancement effects.\n\nA few small clinical studies have shown possible links between prescription of phenylpiracetam and improvement in a number of encephalopathic conditions, including lesions of cerebral blood pathways, traumatic brain injury and certain types of glioma.\n\nPhenylpiracetam reverses the depressant effects of the benzodiazepine diazepam, increases operant behavior, inhibits post-rotational nystagmus, prevents retrograde amnesia, and has anticonvulsant properties.\n\nPhenylpiracetam is typically prescribed as a general stimulant or to increase tolerance to extreme temperatures and stress.\n\nPhenylpiracetam has been researched for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.\n\nPilot-cosmonaut Aleksandr Serebrov described being issued and using Phenylpiracetam, as well as it being included in the Soyuz spacecraft's standard emergency medical kit, during his 197-days working in space aboard the Mir space station. He reported \"the drug acts as the equalizer of the whole organism, 'combs' it(sic причесывает), completely excluding impulsiveness and irritability inevitable in the stressful conditions of space flight.\"\n\nClinical trials were conducted at the Serbsky State Scientific Center for Social and Forensic Psychiatry. The Serbsky Center, Moscow Institute of Psychiatry, and Russian Center of Vegetative Pathology are reported to have confirmed the effectiveness of Phenylpiracetam(Phenytropil) describing the following effects: improvement of regional blood flow in ischemic regions of the brain, reduction of depressive and anxiety disorders, increase the resistance of brain tissue to hypoxia and toxic effects, improving concentration and mental activity, a psychoactivating(sic) effect, increase in the threshold of pain sensitivity, improvement in the quality of sleep, and an anticonvulsant action, though with the side effect of an anorexic effect in extended use.\n\nIn Wistar rats with gravitational cerebral ischemia, Phenylpiracetam reduced the extent of neuralgic deficiency manifestations, retained the locomotor, research, and memory functions, increased the survival rate, and lead to the favoring of local cerebral flow restoration upon the occlusion of carotid arteries to a greater extent than did piracetam.\n\nPhenylpiracetam is known to increase operant behavior. In tests against a control, Sprague-Dawley rats given free access to less-preferred rat chow and trained to operate a lever repeatedly to obtain preferred rat chow performed additional work when given methylphenidate, d-amphetamine, and phenylpiracetam. Rats given 1 mg/kg amphetamine performed an average of 150% as much work and consumed 50% as much non-preferred rat chow than control rats; rats given 10 mg/kg Methylphenidate performed 170% as much work and consumed similarly; and rats given 100 mg/kg Phenylpiracetam performed an average of 375% as much work, and consumed little non-preferred rat chow.\n\nPhenylpiracetam binds to α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the\nmouse brain cortex with IC50 = 5.86 μM.\n\nIn rats, scopolamine is used to model memory impairment. It impairs performance in the conditioned passive avoidance reflex test, increases cortical nACh and hippocampal NMDA receptor densities, and decreases striatal D and cortical benzodiazepine receptor densities. Phenylpiracetam demonstrates antiamnestic activity by restoring performance in the passive avoidance test and partially reversing each of these scopolamine-induced receptor density changes.\n\nExperiments performed on Sprague-Dawley rats in a European patent for using Phenylpiracetam to treat sleep disorders showed an increase in extracellular dopamine levels after administration. The patent asserts discovery of phenylpiracetam's action as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor as its basis.\n\nPhenylpiracetam may also act as a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, making it an NDRI.\n\nWhile not prescribed as a pharmaceutical in the West, in Russia it was available as a prescription medicine under the name Phenotropil until April 2017. \n\nPhenylpiracetam is not scheduled by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nBecause it increases physical stamina and provides improved tolerance to cold weather, it appears on the lists of stimulants banned for in-competition use by the World Anti-Doping Agency. This list is applicable in all Olympic sports.\n\n"}

The two women were promoted on June 11. Hays and Hoisington were promoted within minutes of each other. Because they were promoted in alphabetical order, Hays was the first woman in the United States Armed Forces to wear the insignia of a brigadier general. \n\nThe Hoisington and Hays promotions resulted in positive public relations for the Army, including appearances on the Dick Cavett, David Frost and \"Today\" shows.

The album was released by Capitol Records on July 15, 1973 (see 1973 in music) and was certified gold by the RIAA a little over a month after its release. Two singles were released from the album. The first single, \"We're an American Band\", was released on July 2, 1973 and the second, \"Walk Like a Man\", was released on October 29, 1973. Both singles were sung by drummer Don Brewer. There is an addition to the band on this release - Craig Frost - who plays the organ, clavinet and Moog. Craig was credited as an additional musician on \"Phoenix\" which was released the previous year.\n\nThe album cover was originally covered in gold-colored foil on the outside, and the initial run of pressings were pressed in clear, dark yellow vinyl. The album has been reissued many times and is currently available in the Compact Disc format. A Quadraphonic mix of the album was available in the Quadraphonic 8-Track cartridge format.\n\nThe album is #200 of the National Association of Recording Merchandisers (NARM) Definitive 200 albums of all time.\n\n\"We're an American Band\" was the group's first collaboration with producer/engineer Todd Rundgren. Rundgren and the band recorded the album at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida on June 13–15, 1973. Rundgren would go on to produce the band's next album, \"Shinin' On\" (1974), before the band switched to Jimmy Ienner.\n\nThe album's original issue, as well as the \"We're an American Band\" single, was on translucent yellow vinyl, symbolic of a 'Gold record'. The album labels, above the side numbers, instructed listeners to play \"at full volume\". It included four stickers (two blue, and two red) with the Grand Funk \"Pointing Finger\" logo. Emphasizing the shortening of the group's name, the word \"Railroad\" does not appear anywhere on the album sleeve, liner, or vinyl record, except as the title of the first song on side two of the album.\n\nUpon the album's release, \"We're an American Band\" became the band's best received album by critics, so far. Robert Christgau gave the album a B-, his highest rating for a Grand Funk Railroad album at the time (although \"Shinin' On\" (1974) and \"Grand Funk Hits\" (1976) would receive a B and B+, respectively). A modern review of the album by William Ruhlmann for Allmusic stated that the album was a departure from the band's usual material, which was mostly due to Todd Rundgren's production and Don Brewer's increase in lead vocal work. Ruhlmann also said that the album sounded more professional than their previous ones.\n\n\"Per sleeve notes\"\n\n\n\"Per sleeve notes\"\n"}

The local post office on Magnolia Boulevard canceled all mail with a \"Valley Village\" postmark. It was, however, officially a section of North Hollywood.\n\nThe idea of separating Valley Village from North Hollywood was brought into public light with a meeting of about 300 homeowners at Colfax Avenue Elementary School in December 1985, yet it wasn't until 1991 that Valley Village got seven new blue reflective markers from the city of Los Angeles to mark its borders.\n\nReporter James Quinn of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that Valley Village no longer wanted to be associated with North Hollywood, \"a community that has grown old, heavily Latino and crime-plagued,\" but, in the same article, Valley Village leader Tom Paterson was quoted as saying that the move \"was more than an attempt to boost property values\" and that it \"had nothing to do with ethnic demographics.\" Rather, he said, \"It was one economic level seeking to have its own identity.\" Quinn wrote that:\n\nHouses along Valley Village's lushly landscaped, graffiti-free streets cost up to $800,000, and a two-bedroom, two-bath entry-level house will run $300,000, residents say. Elsewhere in North Hollywood, that same size entry-level house can be purchased for as little as $150,000, real estate agents say. And the cheaper house is likely to have an overgrown, dusty yard and to be in a neighborhood reeling from crime, with gang graffiti splattered on block walls and street signs.\n\nIn December 1985, some three hundred homeowners gathered at Colfax Avenue Elementary School to begin a campaign to head off development of what they called \"stucco mountains\" – continued construction of large apartments and office buildings in the area. Councilman Joel Wachs said he would support the drive, although he rejected the details of a proposed advisory panel for the area. He said a proposed panel of homeowners might overlook the concerns of renters and the need for rental housing. Residents complained about blocked views, parking problems and traffic congestion because of buildings as high as five stories next to their single-family homes.\n\nThe measure would not have banned construction but would have limited all new buildings to two stories and the square footage of commercial development to 1 1/2 times the size of the lot. The plan had the support of Valley Village resident Tom Paterson, president of the Valley Village Homeowners Association, but the opposition of, for one, Marvin Eisenman, an apartment-building owner who said it would not be fair to landowners who purchased property with the idea of developing it. It was touted as a temporary measure until city planners could conduct public hearings on new, permanent development limits. On September 17, 1986, the City Council approved the idea on a 10-2 vote, but less than a month later it reversed itself after heavy lobbying – by former Councilman Arthur K. Snyder, among others – and sent the ordinance back to committee, with the idea that it could be brought back with exemptions for areas where development had already occurred. Finally, substantially the same measure was approved by the council on a temporary basis with exemptions for two dozen properties in areas where there had already been substantial development, like the south side of Riverside Drive between Colfax Avenue and Laurel Canyon Boulevard.\n\nEventually, the Los Angeles city Planning Commission recommended that a three-story limit be adopted for the Valley Village area.\n\nThe boundaries of Valley Village as delineated by the Valley Village Neighborhood Council are Burbank Blvd to the north, the Tujunga Wash to the west, the Ventura Freeway (US 101) to the south and CA 170 to the east.\n\nThe boundaries of Valley Village as delineated by Google Maps are Burbank Blvd to the north, the Tujunga Wash to the west, the Ventura Freeway (US 101) to the south and CA 170 to the east.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times' Mapping L.A. Project delineates the Valley Village borders as Burbank Blvd. to the north, the CA 170 to the east, the Ventura Freeway to the south and Coldwater Canyon Avenue to the west.\n\nThe 2.09-square-mile neighborhood lies north of Studio City, east of Sherman Oaks, and south and west of North Hollywood.\n\nIn 1994, the \"Los Angeles Times\" called Valley Village an \"area of upscale residences.\" The 2000 census found that renters occupied 68.7% of the housing units, and homeowners occupied the remaining 31.3%. In 2006, Valley Village was described in another article as a neighborhood \"mostly of 1,700 sqft, single-story Spanish- and ranch-style homes that typically sit on nice-size lots.\" Most of the 3,881 single-family homes were on residential streets, and 1,073 condos and 8,213 apartment units lined the main boulevards.\nA total of 24,190 people lived in Valley Village's 2.09 square miles, according to the 2000 U.S. census – averaging 11,600 people per square mile, about average for Los Angeles. Population was estimated at 25,665 in 2008. With its percentage of white people considered high for Los Angeles County, Valley Village is still moderately diverse in its ethnic makeup, with a diversity index of 0.512. \"The diversity index measures the probability that any two residents, chosen at random, would be of different ethnicities. If all residents are of the same ethnic group it's zero. If half are from one group and half from another it's .50.\" Whites made up 66.7% of the population, Latinos were 18.9%, with black people at 5.5% and Asians and others both at 4.4%. The median age was 36, considered old when compared to the city as a whole. There is a sizable Jewish community.\n\nThe $55,470 median household income in 2008 dollars was average for the city and county. The average household size of two people was low for both the city and the county. The percentages of divorced men, divorced women, never-married men and widowed women were among the county's highest.\n\nSchools within Valley Village are:\n\nHigh schools:\n\n\nContinuation school:\n\n\nElementary schools:\n\n\n\nA house at 5258 Hermitage Avenue where film actress Marilyn Monroe lived in 1944-45 under her married name of Norma Jean Dougherty, was demolished by a property developer to make way for a condominium project in June 2015 even as it was under consideration as a historic landmark. She lived there at age 17 while her husband, James Dougherty, was in the Navy, and she had a job inspecting parachutes at a nearby factory. She was living there when she was asked to pose for her first pin-up photo. It was said, however, that the chances of the house being declared a landmark were slim because, as Ken Bernstein, director of the city's Office of Historic Resources, put it, \"There are hundreds, if not thousands, of houses associated with celebrities. Monroe resided at the property for only one year \"and did not live in the unit during the productive period of her career,\" a report by city planning officials said.\n\nIn October 2015, Los Angeles was facing a lawsuit over the house's destruction by a group called Save Valley Village. At issue was the City Council's practice of \"automatically heeding the wishes\" of the council member who represents any given area in a controversy. The group said it also had \"overwhelming evidence\" that an environmental report should have been prepared for the condo project. The group also asked that the city nullify any development projects that received unanimous support during the previous twelve months.\n\n"}
{"id": "2285441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2285441", "title": "Malkata", "text": "Malkata\n\nMalkata (or Malqata), meaning \"the place where things are picked up\" in Arabic, is the site of an Ancient Egyptian palace complex built during the New Kingdom, by the 18th Dynasty pharaoh Amenhotep III. It is located on the West Bank of the Nile at Thebes, Upper Egypt, in the desert to the south of Medinet Habu. The site also included a temple dedicated to Amenhotep III's Great Royal Wife, Tiy, which honors Sobek, the crocodile deity.\n\nThere are various structures in the desert, consisting of several residential palaces, a temple of Amun, a festival hall, elite villas, houses for the relatives of the royal family, apartments for attendants, and a desert altar termed the \"Kom al-Samak\", all of which were constructed of mud bricks.\n\nThe palace was built in the 14th century BC and its ancient name was \"Per-Hay\", \"House of Rejoicing\". \nOriginally, the palace was known as \"the Palace of the Dazzling Aten\". Built mostly out of mud-brick, it was Amenhotep's residence throughout most of the later part of his reign. Construction began around year 11 of his reign and continued until the king moved there permanently around his year 29. Once completed, it was the largest royal residence in Egypt.\n\nTo the east of the palace a large ceremonial lake was dug. The palace area was connected to the Nile through a system of canals, which end in a large harbour or quay, now called \"Birket Habu\".\n\nThe palace contained many audience halls, central halls, courtyards, villas, smaller palace complexes for the royal family, and apartments for officials. The harbor and canal connected the palace with the Nile, allowing easy travel across the river to the city of Thebes, which was situated on the eastern bank. There is little evidence of this lake today and little but the foundations of the palace itself remain. \n\nThe \"royal apartment\" featured a bedroom, a dressing room, a private audience chamber, and a harem, which, after the reign of Amenhotep III, was used simply for storage. The palace had a central courtyard, and across from the pharaoh's rooms were apartments for his daughters and son. His Great Royal Wife, Tiye, had her own smaller palace complex diagonally across from the pharaoh's. The palace grounds contained gardens and a large pleasure lake. \n\nRemains exist of a temple of Amun to the north of the palace, within the complex. A \"desert altar\" on the outskirts of the ruins has also been excavated. Remains of a temple to the goddess Isis lie south of the main palace complex.\n\nMalqata was managed by a veritable army of servants and staff. Remains of kitchens near the royal chamber have been found, as well as servant quarters. The palace resembled a complete city, with officials in charge of different sections, such as the gardens and the different apartments and quarters.\n\nFragments of plastered wall paintings have given archaeologists a glimpse of how the palace was decorated. Various paintings of the goddess Nekhbet made up the ceiling of the royal bedchamber. The walls were decorated with scenes of wildlife - flowers, reeds, and animals in the marshes, as well as decorative geometric designs, complete with rosettes. Ornate wooden columns painted to resemble lilies supported the ceilings. In the palace archaeologists also found some paintings of the great royal wife, Tiye. Rare traces of original wall paintings are still visible on site, despite the badly ruined state of the mudbrick walls.\n\nThe palace seems to have been begun by Amenhotep III in the early 14th century BC and the site was occupied as late as the Roman-Byzantine Period. Malqata was most definitely Amenhotep's main residence near Thebes, the capital of ancient Egypt, and therefore, probably his main palace in all of the country. Remains of other smaller palaces in Thebes and other cities throughout Egypt have been found, but none were as large as Amenhotep's palace at Malqata.\n\nMalqata was abandoned by Akhenaten, Amenhotep III's son and successor when he moved the capital to his new city at Amarna, perhaps in order to break the influence of the powerful priests of the Temple of Amun. However, it may have been re-inhabited by the youthful Tutankhamen, when the traditional religion and capital were restored and the priests of the temple regained their influence in the interwoven religion and government of Ancient Egypt. \n\nTutankhamen's successor, Ay, probably inhabited the palace briefly, and pharaoh Horemheb after him as well, but by the ascension of Ramesses II, it was simply a minor residence, as the capital was moved to Pi-Ramesses in the far north.\n\nThe palace ruins were \"rediscovered\" several times: in 1888 by Daressy; by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1910-1920; by University Museum of Pennsylvania in the 1970s; and since 1985, they have been the site of excavations by the Archaeological Mission of Waseda University.\n\nJust south of the palace there is a temple devoted to Isis which was built in the Roman period. The modern name for this temple is \"Deir al-Shalwi\".\n\nExcavations of the area by the Waseda team unearthed the remains of a Roman settlement and cemetery, finding remains from the times of Trajan and Hadrian.\n\nNext to the site is a modern village. Here there is a tiny church and monastery dedicated to St Tawdros.\n\n\n"}

KCR Corporation originally planned two stations along the new section of line: Austin and Canton Road stations. The latter station was cancelled due to failed negotiations with private landowners. As a result, Austin was the only new station built as part of the Kowloon Southern Link scheme.\n\nDuring the planning and early construction stages, the station was called \"West Kowloon Station\" ().

He wrote several books, among which \"Psycho-Cybernetics\" was a long-time bestseller — influencing many subsequent self-help teachers. His orientation towards a system of ideas that would provide self-help is considered the forerunner of the now popular self-help books.\n\nMaxwell \"Max\" Maltz was born March 10, 1899, in Manhattan's Lower East Side, the third child of Josef Maltz and Taube Elzweig, both Jewish immigrants from what was then known as the town of \"Resche\" in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (today Rzeszów, Poland). \n\nIn 1923, Maltz graduated with a doctorate in medicine from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. He also undertook training under German plastic surgeons who were considered most advanced in cosmetic surgery at that time.\n\nIn 1960, \"Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Way to Get More Living out of Life\" was first published by Prentice-Hall and appeared in a pocket book edition by 1969. The book introduced Maltz's views that people must have an accurate and positive view of themselves before setting goals; otherwise they will get stuck in a continuing pattern of limiting beliefs. His ideas focus on visualizing one's goals and he believed that self-image is the cornerstone of all the changes that take place in a person. According to Maltz, if one's self-image is unhealthy or faulty — all of a person's efforts will end in failure.\n\nMaltz also wrote fiction, including a play called \"Unseen Scar\" (1946) and a novel, \"The Time is Now\" (1975). His autobiography, \"Doctor Pygmalion: The Autobiography of a Plastic Surgeon\" (1953), was popular and influential, being discussed in many subsequent books on body and identity. It was re-titled \"Doctor Psycho-Cybernetics\" after his self-help work was published.\n\nAlthough the book \"Psycho-Cybernetics\" was first published in 1960, as of 2008 the book is one of 50 recommended in the book \"50 Self-Help Classics\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2285473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2285473", "title": "Neigong", "text": "Neigong\n\nNeigong, also spelled \"nei kung\", \"neigung\", or \"nae gong\", refers to any of a set of Chinese breathing, meditation and spiritual practice disciplines associated with Daoism and especially the Chinese martial arts. Neigong practice is normally associated with the so-called \"soft style\", \"internal\" or neijia Chinese martial arts, as opposed to the category known as waigong or \"external skill\" which is historically associated with shaolinquan or the so-called \"hard style\", \"external\" or wàijiā Chinese martial arts. Both have many different schools, disciplines and practices and historically there has been mutual influence between the two and distinguishing precisely between them differs from school to school. \n\nThere is both martial and non-martial neigong. Well known examples of martial neigong are the various breathing and focus trainings taught in some traditional Taijiquan, Baguazhang Xingyiquan and Liuhebafa schools. An example of non-martial neigong is the discipline known as Daoyin.\n\nThe martial art school of neigong emphasises training the coordination of the individual's body with the breath, known as the harmonisation of the inner and outer energy (), creating a basis for a particular school's method of utilising power and technique. \n\nNeigong exercises that are part of the neijia tradition involve cultivating physical stillness and or conscious (deliberate) movement, designed to produce relaxation or releasing of muscular tension combined with special breathing techniques such as the \"tortoise\" or \"reverse\" methods. The fundamental purpose of this process is to develop a high level of coordination, concentration and technical skill that is known in the martial arts world as neijin (). The ultimate purpose of this practice is for the individual to become at one with heaven or the Dao (). As Zhuangzi stated, \"Heaven, earth and I are born of one, and I am at one with all that exists ()\".\n\nMartial Nei Gung is about developing internal power. One way to possibly achieve this is to train particular exercises regularly where the breath is matched with movements of blood or to effect the movement of blood throughout the body. Through these exercises it can be possible to move the blood to a particular area during a particular movement to have a particular result. One of the benefits of martial nei gung exercises is the relaxation of blood vessels, nerves, muscles and sinews to help the body move more freely. With the body moving freely and an excess of blood moving to a particular area with little or no effort, the practitioner can possibly develop many benefits. These benefits may include:\n\nIt is important to understand that anyone looking to learn Nei Gung sincerely, is more likely to learn it from a good teacher of internal martial arts like Hsing-Yi (one of the easiest and most powerful forms of martial cultivation). It is rare to learn authentic Daoist practices from a true master of the subject as quite a lot of the Nei Gung skills are an essential part of a complete system of martial arts. Nei Gung is not a philosophy, but a technique and an art of inner cultivation. There are intellectual guidelines to the practice of Nei Gung, but it is 'Inner Work' which means effort has to be put in to develop real, substantial and testable skills. This is not something that can be imagined or talked about, only from direct experience and hard effort can an understanding of Nei Gung develop. A true practitioner and teacher will take you on a journey growing your inner-world and showing you how to demonstrate the skills you are developing.\n\nThis type of practice is said to require concentration and internal reflection which results in a heightened self-awareness that increases over time with continued practice. Neigong practitioners report awareness of the mechanics of their blood circulation, peristalsis, muscular movement, skeletal alignment, balance, etc. \n\nWhat is said to be occurring as the result of continual practice is a type of internal alchemy, that is a refinement and transmutation of the \"Three Treasures\" or \"San Bao\" (), in Chinese. The Three Treasures are known as Jing (), Qi () and Shen () and can be loosely translated as Essence, Vitality and Spirit. \n\nAccording to Daoist doctrine the Three Treasures can be described as three types of energy available to humans. The Dao De Jing purported to be written by Lao zi states in chapter 42 that \"The Dao () gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two (Taiji () or Yin and Yang ()) and the Two gives birth to the Three (which some interpret to mean Jing , Qi and Shen , or sometimes Heaven Tian , Earth Di and Man Ren ) and Three gives birth to the Four direction's, North, South, East, and West and so on to the 10,000 Things (Wanwu ); which is all that exists between heaven and earth.\n\nNeigong training follows therefore the classical Daoist developmental stages and regards the first two stages as a preparation for the last and final stage:\n<br>\"Physical body (Jing) -> Energy body (Qi) -> Divine Consciousness (Shen)\"\n\n\n\n(Wayback Machine copy)\n"}

(TIR stands for \"Transports Internationaux Routiers\" or \"International Road Transports\".) The 1975 convention replaced the TIR Convention of 1959, which itself replaced the 1949 TIR Agreement between a number of European countries. The conventions were adopted under the auspices of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). As of December 2018, there are 76 parties to the Convention, including 75 states and the European Union.\n\nThe TIR Convention establishes an international customs transit system with maximum facility to move goods:\n\nThe TIR system not only covers customs transit by road but a combination is possible with other modes of transport (e.g., rail, inland waterway, and even maritime transport), as long as at least one part of the total transport is made by road.\n\nTo date, more than 33,000 international transport operators had been authorised (by their respective competent national authorities) to access the TIR system, using around 1.5 million TIR carnets per year.\n\nIn light of the expected increase in world trade, further enlargement of its geographical scope and the forthcoming introduction of an electronic TIR system (so-called \"eTIR-system\"), it is expected that the TIR system will continue to remain the only truly global customs transit system.\n\nDue to the large blue-and-white TIR plates carried by vehicles using the TIR convention, the word \"TIR\" entered many languages, such as Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian or Turkish, as a neologism, becoming the default generic name of a large truck.\n\nSaudi Arabia acceded to the convention on 17 May 2018, and the convention entered into force for Saudi Arabia on 17 November 2018. With the accession of Saudi Arabia, the TIR Convention had seventy-four Contracting Parties.\n\nTruckers making use of the TIR procedure must first obtain an internationally harmonised customs document, referred to as a TIR carnet. TIR carnets are issued by national road transport associations. This customs document is valid internationally and as well as describing the goods, their shipper and their destination, represents a financial guarantee. When a truck arrives at a border customs post it need not pay import duties and taxes on goods at that time. Instead the payments are suspended. If the vehicle transits the country without delivering any goods, no taxes are due. If it fails to leave the country with all the goods, then the taxes are billed to the importer and the financial guarantee backstops the importer's obligation to pay the taxes. TIR transits are carried out in bond, i.e. the lorry must be sealed as well as bearing the carnet. The security payment system is administered by the International Road Transport Union (IRU).\n\nThe TIR procedure is mostly used with Eastern European countries that are not in the EU (e.g. Russia and Ukraine), Turkey, and parts of the Near East. Since the formation of the European single market, the TIR procedure has become unnecessary for intra-EU goods transport.\n\nDue to BREXIT, TIR carnets could become part of the solution to merchandise traffic between GB and other European countries - or transit intra-EU - for example between Ireland and mainland Europe.\n\n\n"}

During the reign of Mahmud II, when the military and imperial band were re-organized along Western lines, Giuseppe Donizetti was invited to head the process. Donizetti Pasha, as he was known in the Ottoman Empire, composed the first Western-style imperial anthem, the \"Mahmudiye Marşı\". \n\nLike in many other monarchies of its time, the anthem of the Ottoman Empire was an imperial anthem, not a national one. Hence it paid homage to a specific ruler and a new anthem was composed at each imperial succession. However, in 1844, with the Tanzimat reforms, the \"Mecidiye Marşı\" was recognized as the first official Ottoman national anthem. The first official Ottoman national flag (which was in essence identical to the present-day Turkish flag) was also adopted in 1844.\n\n\nAfter the start of the imperial anthem tradition, two Sultans did not have specific anthems composed. The first is Murad V, who reigned for 3 months in 1876 and the second is the last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Mehmed VI, who used the \"Mahmudiye Marşı\" anthem. \n\nOnly the \"Hamidiye Marşı\" and \"Reşadiye Marşı\" have lyrics, the first three anthems being instrumental.\n\n\n"}

He denounces them all as traitors, then storms out in disgust to find Buffy after exchanging a few blows with Faith. Spike tracks down and comforts a depressed Buffy, while Faith accepts her role as the newly elected leader of the Potentials.\n\nThe Scoobies capture a Bringer and magically interrogate him.

Later, after saying goodnight to Giles, Faith is approached by The First (in the form of Richard Wilkins), who leads her to believe that Buffy only sees her as a killer and will take the first chance she gets to kill her.\n\nThat evening, four couples engage in intimacy. Buffy and Spike take refuge in an abandoned house, and Buffy confesses her self-doubt and inability to let anyone become close to her. Spike tries to rally her spirits by describing that he's seen all of her, the good and the bad, but he still stands by her. Buffy asks Spike to spend the night.

She appeared in 51 episodes (48 episodes of \"Law & Order\", one episode of \"\" and two episodes of \"\"). Her character was particularly notable for the fact that she was the first woman in the program's history to hold the position of New York County District Attorney (no woman has held the position in real life). Pursuant to New York law, an interim District Attorney is appointed by the Governor.\n\nPrior to her appointment as interim DA, Lewin was a law professor, which often provoked her critics to dismiss her as a detached academic with no practical experience. Lewin's term as DA is defined by a liberally directed program of legal application to many notable criminal cases, which often brings her into political and legal dilemmas. While she is an idealist, however, she is not prepared to subvert the correct application of the law due to her personal beliefs. In a 2001 episode, she is confronted with the decision to pursue the death penalty in a conviction of an 18-year-old murderer. While she personally opposes the death penalty, she realizes that her office would be seen as soft on crime, and reluctantly succumbs to political pressure. The young man is found guilty and sent to death row.\n\nLewin works closely with Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston) and Abbie Carmichael (Angie Harmon). Her political beliefs often put her into conflict with both of them, especially the latter, a staunch political conservative. After Carmichael leaves the DA's office, Lewin replaces her with Serena Southerlyn (Elisabeth Röhm), whose liberal idealism more closely resembles her own political philosophy.\n\nShe has a niece, indicating that she has at least one sibling.\n\nIn September 2002, after two years of her term as District Attorney, Lewin departs the office. The manner in which she departed the show is never specified on screen. However, in his tie-in book \",\" Dick Wolf wrote that his intention for the character was that Lewin found herself disenchanted with the position of D.A., and opted not to run for election following her interim term. Fred Dalton Thompson subsequently joined the cast as Republican Arthur Branch. Wiest later stated, in the book \"Actors at Work,\" written jointly by Rosemarie Tichler and Barry Jay Kaplan, that she was tired of the role and wished to move on to other projects.\n\nIn her first scene, Lewin is introduced to McCoy by Mayor Rudy Giuliani (playing himself in a cameo appearance), who praises Lewin's record and assures her that she will do a fine job as District Attorney.\n\n"}

Cony draws its students from Augusta, as well as the surrounding communities of Chelsea, China, Jefferson, Palermo, Somerville, Vassalboro, Whitefield, and Windsor.\n\nThe school's origins are in the Cony Female Academy, which was founded in 1816 by Daniel Cony to provide free education to orphans and other girls under the age of 16. The school later expanded into a co-ed high school. In the fall of 2006, the city of Augusta opened a new Cony High School adjacent to the Capital Area Technical Center on Pierce Drive. Three years later, it was consolidated with local middle schools, and currently serves grades 7-12.\n\nThe new building is architecturally linked to the design of the Old Cony High School building which featured a wedge-shaped flatiron design. The flatiron building has been preserved as a building of historical significance and is in the National Register of Historical Places in Maine.\n\nThe current enrollment for Cony High is approximately 1,000 students.\n\nIn 2019, Cony High School was ranked 43rd out of 125 high schools in the state and 7,384th nationally, according to US News & World Report.\n\nIn 2019, approximately 20% of students passed with proficient ratings in the math section and 51% in the reading section of the Maine Educational Assessment, as compared with 40% across the state of Maine for reading. Approximately 26% of students took at least one AP exam in their high school careers.\n\nThe graduation rate was approximately 78%.\n\nCony competes in the Kennebec Valley Athletic Conference as a Class A school in all sports but football. The Rams field teams in football, soccer, field hockey, cross country, golf, volleyball, basketball, cheerleading, ice hockey, indoor track, swimming, wrestling, baseball, softball, tennis, lacrosse, and outdoor track. Cony and rival Gardiner Area High School hold the longest-running high school football rivalry in the country. Since 1892, the two teams have met 123 continuous years, with Cony holding a 65-55-10 advantage. Cony is well known for having one of the rowdiest student cheering sections in the state, referred to as the \"Cony Crazies.\"\n\nCony High School's \"Chizzle Wizzle\" variety show is the longest running high school production in the United States.

The production runs for 4 nights at the end of every March and culminates with the Chizzle Wizzle Ball on Saturday night. The name, \"Chizzle Wizzle\" comes from one of the school's many old cheers: \"Chizzle Wizzle, Chizzle Wizzle, sis boom bah! Cony High, Cony High, rah, rah, rah!\"\n\n"}

It's based on a series of four novels by Swedish author Vilhelm Moberg detailing a family's poverty-driven migration from Sweden to America in the mid-19th century: \"The Emigrants\", \"Unto a Good Land\", \"The Settlers\", and \"The Last Letter Home\".\n\nThe show premiered at the Malmö Opera and Music Theatre in Malmö, Sweden, on 7 October 1995 and received a rapturous welcome. The audience gave it a 10-minute standing ovation, while the critics unanimously praised it. Martin Nyström of \"Dagens Nyheter\" wrote that Andersson and Ulvaeus \"created a great Swedish musical that thematically touches on the great questions of our time\" and compared Andersson's musicality with that of Schubert; while \"Svenska Dagbladet\"'s Carl-Gunnar Åhlén concluded that Björn Ulvaeus \"succeeded in presenting the drama without getting bogged down, despite its almost Wagnerian length.\" A few years later, however, Dagens Nyheter reviewer Marcus Boldemann wrote that \"Kristina från Duvemåla is not an A-class musical work.\"\n\nOn 12 October 1996, the 90-minute (of a nearly four-hour score) concert version with the original cast was presented, in Swedish, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, as an opening event of the Plymouth Music Series 1996–1997 season in Orchestra Hall; and next day in Chisago Lakes High School in Lindstrom, Minnesota – the area where much of the events in Moberg's books took place and where the statue of the books' two main characters stands on the main street of the town.\n\nThe American premiere received a glowing review from \"Minneapolis Star and Tribune\": \"I have seen the future of the music theater, and its name is Kristina... Engaging, emotionally charged – and at times haunting – a piece of work capable of enchanting US viewers even when performed in a cut-down, concert version and in a tongue foreign to the audience\"; while Helen Sjöholm who performed the role of Kristina was described as \"extraordinary.\"\n\n\"Time\" magazine later wrote that \"the show has Swedes, Americans, Indians; a sacrificial whore and the death of a child; and – in case you think it sounds too solemn for your tastes – a bilingual fart joke... and it's one of the most ambitious swatches of musical theater (39 songs!) since Gershwin's 1935 \"Porgy and Bess,\" with one of the most serious, lyrically seductive scores since Rodgers and Hammerstein were creating their midcentury, midcult epics.\"\n\nSubsequently, the musical was staged at Gothenburg Opera and then premiered at the Stockholm's Cirkus that was specially renovated for it. This production won four 1998 Guldmasken Theatre Awards (Swedish equivalent of Tony Award). Counting all three runs, which were almost continuous, interrupted only by summer vacations and hiatuses due to the production's physical moving, \"Kristina från Duvemåla\" ran for nearly four years (more than 650 performances in total), making it the second longest running musical in Swedish history. In 2001, a touring concert staging was presented featuring most of the original performers recreating their previous roles. All three original Swedish productions were directed by Lars Rudolfsson with set design by Tony Award-winner Robin Wagner and musical direction by Anders Eljas.\n\nThe original cast triple CD set was released in 1996 and peaked at number two on the Swedish album chart, remaining on it for a total of 74 weeks and winning the 1996 Swedish Grammis Award as the best album. For a number of years, a song from the musical \"Guldet blev till sand\" (The gold turned into sand) performed by Peter Jöback held the distinction of having spent the longest amount of time on the national Swedish radio chart Svensktoppen.\n\nBy the mid-2000s, the show had been translated into English by Björn Ulvaeus and the \"Les Misérables\" English lyricist Herbert Kretzmer. English translations of individual songs have been presented at various concert performances throughout the last two or three years, mainly by Helen Sjöholm or Swedish musical theatre stalwart Tommy Körberg, always in association with Benny Andersson or Björn Ulvaeus.\n\nIn March 2006, a workshop was held in New York and featured Sara Chase as Kristina, Clarke Thorell as Karl Oskar, Kevin Odekirk as Robert and Alice Ripley as Ulrika, the latter performing the song \"You Have To Be There\" from the musical in her and Emily Skinner's 2006 show at The Town Hall in New York and later releasing this live recording on \"Raw At Town Hall\" 2-CD set.\n\nAt the time, there had been talk of a fall 2007 opening at The Broadway Theatre, but those plans never materialized partly due to a protracted legal battle over the use of the original book written for the musical.\n\nThe English-language premiere of the musical, in a concert version under the name \"Kristina: A Concert Event,\" took place at Carnegie Hall on 23 and 24 September 2009, with Helen Sjöholm as Kristina, Russell Watson as Karl Oskar, Louise Pitre as Ulrika and Kevin Odekirk as Robert.\n\nThe performances received mixed reviews, from \"Time\" commenting that \"some of the most rapturous melodies ever heard in Carnegie Hall poured out of that grand old barn last night\" to \"Variety\" concluding that \"Moberg's series adds up to some 1,800 pages, and many in the restless Carnegie Hall audience may have felt they were sitting through all of them...U.S. audiences are likely to find Kristina's epic tale less than gripping.\" Talkin' Broadway critic Matthew Murray admitted: \"It’s a musical you don’t just want to listen to: During the better portions of its score – of which there are many – you feel you have to...Andersson’s work is so big, so thoroughly conceived, and so varied in style, tempo, and color that it often feels more like a symphony than a musical. Of course, making it one would mean jettisoning the specific story treatment and lyrics, losses most shows couldn’t weather. But its music is so good that Kristina could be even more powerful as a result.\"\n\nThe Carnegie Hall concert recordings were released on a 2-CD set by Decca Records on 12 April 2010.\n\nKerry Ellis premiered the song \"You Have to Be There\" in its English-language version, at \"Thank You for the Music,\" a special event celebrating the music of Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus on 13 September 2009. The song is featured on her debut album \"Anthems\" (2010) produced by Brian May. She has since sung the song at various live events, including (2011).\n\nThe UK premiere of the musical, also in a concert version, took place at the Royal Albert Hall on 14 April 2010.\n\nSimilarly to the US, it received a mixed critical response. \"The inspiration for both score and lyrics feels more like a retread of the worst excesses of \"Les Misérables\" (a fact amplified here by sharing the English lyricist of that show, Herbert Kretzmer) and Frank Wildhorn, with the occasional Lloyd Webber rock riff thrown in for good measure,\" wrote \"The Stage,\" while \"The Times\" concluded that \"the piece displayed moments of musical power. But it will need major restructuring if it is to work on the theatrical stage... if it showed gleams of promise, this concert also emphasised that Kristina still has a long road to travel before any of us is truly moved to say thank you for the music.\"\n\nContrary to these opinions, chief classical music and opera critic for the \"Independent\" Edward Seckerson wrote a highly sympathetic review of the performance, calling Benny Andersson \"a composer/melodist of startling distinction.\" He suggested that \"this one-off concert performance...presented only its bare bones, a series of musical snapshots from a much larger whole... So dramatically sketchy, musically sumptuous. But Andersson's gorgeous folk-sourced melodies (like a Swedish Grieg) spirited us forward from one accordion-flecked knees-up and effusive ballad to the next... If ever a piece sung a nation's pride, this is it.\"\n\n\nReplacement performers included Frida Bergh (Kristina), Joakim Jennefors (Karl Oskar), Niklas Andersson (Robert), Lisa Gustafsson (Kristina) and Christer Nerfont (Robert).\n\n\nOn 9 September 2016, the concert version with a Norwegian cast (but sung in Swedish) was presented at Lillestrøm Kultursenter, Lillestrøm. It was later presented at Lørenskog Hus, Lørenskog, and at Ullensaker Kulturhus, Jessheim. The entire run was sold out and got rave reviews in the press. The Romerike symphony Orchestra and St. Laurentius choir was conducted by Anders Eljas who was also musical director for this production.\n\nFor 25 years Nils has worked with an iron rod to move stones from the fields of his farm Korpamoen in Ljuder's parish, Småland, Sweden. One day he slips and a big rock rolls onto him, breaking both his hip and femur. As a cripple he cannot work and is forced to sell the farm. His oldest son, Karl Oskar, barely of age, convinces Nils to sell the farm to him, and he buys it for 1700 riksdaler.\n\nKarl Oskar visits his girlfriend Kristina, who waits for him and pictures him making his way through the familiar surroundings (\"Duvemåla Pasture\"). Karl Oskar tells her that he has bought his father's farm, and can now marry her (\"My Lust For You\"). They marry and begin a life together, but times are hard because of bad harvests (King of Stone's Kingdom). Kristina worries that they cannot support their growing family, and suggests to her husband that they take steps to prevent another pregnancy. Karl Oskar says that it would be a betrayal of his love for her.\n\nKarl Oskar's younger brother, Robert, is on his way to begin work as a farm hand on a nearby farm. He stops by a stream and wishes he was as free as the water (\"Out Towards a Sea\").\n\nKristina is pregnant again, and she and Karl Oskar worry that they won't be able to feed their children during winter, because of a drought and bad harvest. An angry Karl Oskar tells God that since he took their hay last year, he might as well take the rest. Shortly thereafter lightning strikes the barn, setting it on fire. Kristina tells her husband that he got what he wished for (\"Bad Harvest\").\n\nYoung Arvid, who works as a farmhand beside Robert at the farm of Nybacken, is unjustly punished by his mistress; in desperation, he sets out to kill her with an axe, but Robert stops him. The two boys dream of a better world, a world across the ocean, called North America, which Robert has read about.\n\nKristina loves her home, and is happy to be married to Karl Oskar and have their three children (Blåklintstäcket/Kristina's Apple Tree). One day Robert returns home, having been beaten by his master. He refuses to go back, and asks for his share of the inheritance so he can leave Sweden and travel to North America. Karl Oskar confesses that he has been considering the same thing; he and Robert try to convince Kristina that she will love America, but she is too afraid (\"No\"). Kristina asks her beloved Uncle, Danjel, to help her change her husband's mind. In a dream, Danjel has a vision where he is called to fulfill his uncle's work of restoring God's Kingdom on earth and to lead the people away from the false teachings. One night he gathers a group of outcasts to celebrate communion (\"Little Group\"); the gathering is disrupted by the Provost and the local authorities, who scatter the group and intend to bring them all to justice for breaking the law. One of the persons in the room, Ulrika of Västergöhl, a former prostitute who is now born again through Christ and lives in Danjel's house, is furious over the hypocrisy of their persecutors, one of whom used to be her customer. Ulrika vows that her illegitimate daughter Elin will never have to suffer because her mother was a whore (\"Never\").\n\nKristina, and Karl Oskar's parents, try to convince him to stay, pointing out the advantages of home (\"Golden Wheat Fields\"). When Kristina makes christening porridge for the new baby, their starving oldest daughter (Anna) eats it, but the grain swells in her stomach, and she dies (\"Come To Me Everyone\"). Realising that the poverty in Sweden is just as dangerous as anything overseas, Kristina agrees to move. They visit the Provost and write down their reasons for emigrating in the church book. The provost warns them of all the horrors waiting in America, saying that God will wipe America off the face of the earth within fifty years. The emigrants begin their journey. Karl Oskar, Kristina, their children and Robert have gained some companions; Danjel and his family are moving to escape religious persecution, along with Ulrika and her daughter, and so is Arvid, who has also been living with Danjel. A group of 16 people leaves Ljuder, never to return (\"We Open Up the Gateways.\")\n\nThe ship turns out to be smaller than they had thought it would be. Karl Oskar must bunk with the bachelors. For the first time in their marriage, Kristina and Karl Oskar are separated (\"Farmers At Sea\"). One day Kristina discovers lice on her body. She is horrified, since she has never had them before in her life, and blames Ulrika, who has none (\"Lice\").\nAn old woman on the ship, Fina-Kajsa, is traveling to find her son in America, carrying a big grindstone because she has heard grindstones are very expensive in America. Fina-Kajsa tells the story of how lice came to be.\n\nOne night in the middle of a storm Karl Oskar is woken by his oldest son, Johan, who tells him that his mother is bleeding. Kristina, pregnant with her fifth child, has fallen ill with scurvy. The captain does what he can to help her, and Karl Oskar sits by her side, waking through the longest night of his life (\"Stay\"). When morning finally comes Kristina is alive, but Danjel's wife, who has been ill for a long time without telling her husband, has died (\"Burial at Sea\").\nFina-Kajsa has a letter from her son, saying that he has plowed 100 acres of fields with good soil. Karl Oskar asks where this is, and Fina-Kajsa reads: \"Taylors Falls, Minnesota.\" Easy to remember, Karl Oskar points out (\"Minne\" meaning \"memory\" in Swedish).\n\nOn Midsummer's Eve land is finally spotted, after two and a half months on the ocean. The sight of all the New Yorkers out for a Sunday walk overwhelms the immigrants, and so does the foreign language (\"A Sunday in Battery Park\"). An apple given by one friendly lady to the children reminds Kristina of home. Johan asks if they can go home now. Kristina remembers her motherland, where they now are celebrating midsummer (\"Home\"). The group travels by train and steamboat, amazed at how wide America is (\"Travel Through America\"). At a land grab Karl Oskar's and Kristina's daughter Lill-Märta disappears. At the last moment, when the paddle steamer already started moving, Ulrika finds Märta and returns the girl to her parents.\n\nOne night the immigrants are left on a pier in Stillwater. It is dark and rainy, and no one understands what they say; they are completely abandoned, until Baptist pastor Henry O Jackson shows up and offers the immigrants shelter, warmth and food. \nAs Danjel prays, thanking the Lord for the food, they find out that they have a word in common: \"Amen.\"\nRobert tells his friend Arvid of his plans to go on the California trail and dig for gold and asks him to come along. Karl Oskar is highly skeptical, but his brother is firmly set on leaving (\"The Dream of Gold\"). The women are amazed by how Pastor Jackson handles household chores, and begin to understand that women are more equal in this country. The immigrants struggle to communicate with Reverend Jackson (\"To Think That Men Like Him Can Exist\").\n\nKarl Oskar and Kristina continue to Lake Ki-Chi-Saga, where they intend to build their new home. Here, with help from Ulrika, Kristina gives birth to a healthy son. Karl Oskar reads the Christmas Gospel for his little family, and Kristina tells her new-born child about the land where she was born, and of her astrakan apple tree which is still carrying fruit (\"My Astrakan\").\n\nA few years have passed by. The settlers gather and celebrate their choice to move to this New World (\"The Superiors\"). But Kristina lies awake at night, tormented by her longing for Sweden, and begs God to let her return (\"Bright Evenings in Springtime\"). Karl Oskar tells her that if God tries to move her back he will reach out his hand and keep her by his side. He shows her the boots that belonged to their daughter Anna, and reminds her why they left Sweden. He plans to write to her father and ask for some seeds from her astrakan tree, in the hope that a new tree planted at their new settlement will help her feel at home.\n\nWhen Christmas comes Karl Oskar has bought Kristina a new stove, called the Queen of the Prairie. Their friends gather at New Duvemåla to celebrate Christmas, and they all marvel at the new stove (\"The Queen of the Prairie\"). The fun gathering is disrupted when Karl Oskar gets into a fight with Nöjd, a fur hunter, who tells Karl Oskar that he does not own the land he farms, which is stolen from the Indians. Karl Oskar describes his plight back home in Sweden, and tells Nöjd how hard he has worked to turn the wild grass on his property into a home and a farm (\"Wild Grass\").\n\nOne evening in June, a strange man is spotted down at the lake shore. Robert has come back from the gold fields. Arvid is not with him, but Robert has a lot of money, which Karl Oskar deposits at the bank. Kristina finds Arvid's watch and demands to know where Arvid is. Robert tells her that he eventually reconciled to his fate and then tells her the story of how they went searching for gold, but ended up lost in the desert.

Karl Oskar becomes furious (\"Wild Cat Money\"), believing that his brother knew this. Robert walks out to the woods where he finds a lonely stream, the symbol of the freedom he never found. He has caught yellow fever, and by the stream he dies (\"Out Towards a Sea (Reprise)\").\n\nKarl Oskar and Kristina plant seeds in their new farmlands, and a great wheat field is grown (\"The Field\"), along with Kristina's apple tree, planted from seeds from home.\n\nBack in Sweden Ulrika was a whore and no respectable man would look at her twice.

Kristina and Ulrika cherish their friendship (\"A Miracle of the Lord\"). Kristina comes to watch her friend being baptised by Pastor Jackson (\"Down to the Sacred Wave\").\n\nKristina suffers a miscarriage and Ulrika takes her to the doctor, then brings Karl Oskar the bad news that, after her miscarriage, Kristina's body cannot take much more. Another childbirth would mean her death (\"Miscarriage\"). A devastated Kristina thinks of all the bad things that have happened to her, having to leave her home, losing her child and now her husband's love. She desperately prays to God, not knowing what she will do if he isn't real (\"You Have To Be There\").\n\nAs time passes, Kristina begins to feel better. One day the settlers gather for a big harvest feast (\"Harvest Feast\"), and she tells Uncle Danjel of her wish to live long enough to see her children grow up. She also tells him about her apple tree, which finally is blooming and will give fruits to the autumn. After the feast Kristina tries to convince Karl Oskar that it is God's meaning that husband and wife should be together, and that if God wants her to live she will live, but if He wants her to die He will take her regardless. Karl Oskar argues, until she repeats the words he said to her so many years ago (\"Here You Have Me Again\").\n\nDuring the civil war, the state of Minnesota gets a civil war of its own, an Indian uprising. Chaos, murder and violence begin to spread (\"Red Iron/The Sioux uprising\") at the same time as Kristina finds out that she is once again carrying a child. She tells Karl Oskar, who is worried. She turns to God and asks for help to comfort him, since she is so weak and tired herself (\"Help Me Comfort\"). The settlers have to leave their homes as the uprising spreads (\"Where Do We Belong?\"). Karl Oskar sends the children away with Danjel, but cannot leave himself because Kristina has miscarried again, and lies dying in her bed.\n\nKarl Oskar is the only settler remaining in St. Croix Valley, but the apples on the Astrakan tree have finally matured. Karl Oskar gives Kristina the first of the ripe apples, and she smells it. She tells Karl Oskar not to grieve, saying she will be waiting for him at Duvemåla Pasture, as she used to (\"I'll Be Waiting There\"). Kristina then dies peacefully in her husband's arms.\n\nOn 23 and 24 September 2009, Benny Andersson, Björn Ulvaeus, Ki-Chi-Saga and Universal Music presented \"Kristina: A Concert Event\"; Music by Benny Andersson; Lyrics by Björn Ulvaeus and Herbert Kretzmer.

Borders on the Upper Silesian Metropolitan Union – metropolis with the population of 2 million. It is located in the Silesian Highlands. The population of the town is 9,175 (2019).\n\nThe municipality is situated a short distance to the south-west of Junction 41 on the A4 Highway. \n\nIt has been in the Silesian Voivodeship since its formation in 1999, previously having been in the Katowice Voivodeship, and before that, in the Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship. Imielin is one of the towns included in the 2.7 million conurbation – Katowice urban area and within a greater Silesian metropolitan area populated by about 5,294,000 people.\n\nThe area is both industrial and agricultural. There are dolomite deposits and, beneath the flatter area to the south-west of the municipality, coal deposits.\n\nThe earliest mention in the records of Imielin dates from 1386. At that time it was part of the Duchy of Racibórz (Ratibor), the eastern border of which was marked by the Przemsza River. Imielin, like the neighbouring villages of Kosztowy and Chełm Śląski was nevertheless isolated from the rest of the duchy by the dense forest which were a feature of the area formed by the sources and headwaters of the Kłodnica and Mleczna rivers. For this reason in 1391 the Duke of Opava-Ratibor gifted this eastern portion of his lands to the Bishop of Kraków. From then until 1742 these villages were no longer part of the political entity of Silesia, control over them instead being exercised by the bishops of Kraków.\n\nFollowing the annexation of Silesia to Prussia by Frederick the Great, sovereignty over the villages was removed from the bishops of Kraków in 1772, and in 1796 administrative control and ownership of the land was also transferred to the Prussian crown. In 1802 Alt Gatsch (Stara Gać) was established as a daughter settlement, followed in 1820 by Neu Gatsch (Nova/New Gać). \n\nDuring the period of pan-European warfare with which the nineteenth century opened, the Napoleonic general Jean Lannes, who had been appointed Prince of Severia by the Duchy of Warsaw, asserted control over Imielin, along with Severia, citing in support the fact that historically both had belonged to the Bishopric of Kraków. Following the end of the Napoleonic War, Imielin was in 1817 returned to Prussia, and in 1818 it was incorporated into the newly created .\n\nImielin's excellent transport links to the industrial cities of Katowice, Oświęcim and Tychy enabled it to grow considerably during the twentieth century, both as a residential town for commuters to these larger centres and on account of businesses establishing themselves in Imielin itself. The official population count increased from 2,614 in 1900 to 5,200 in 1931, and to 7,757 in 1970.\n\nDuring the German Invasion of Poland in 1939, German soldiers mass murdered 28 Poles on the night of 4 and 5 September. The victims included refugees, 3 women and one 5-year old child.\n\nA noteworthy building is Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church, a gothic revival building constructed between 1909 and 1912, and subsequently enlarged in 1953: in 1957 the height of the tower was increased to 27 meters.

{"id": "2285555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2285555", "title": "Puerto Rican immigration to Hawaii", "text": "Puerto Rican immigration to Hawaii\n\nPuerto Rican immigration to Hawaii began when Puerto Rico's sugar industry was devastated by two hurricanes in 1899. The devastation caused a worldwide shortage in sugar and a huge demand for the product from Hawaii. Consequently, Hawaiian sugarcane plantation owners began to recruit the jobless, but experienced, laborers in Puerto Rico.\n\nIn the 19th century Puerto Rico depended mainly on its agricultural economy. The island together with Cuba was the Spanish Crown's leading exporter of sugar, coffee, tobacco and cotton. When the island was ceded to the United States after the Spanish–American War, as stipulated by the agreements of the Treaty of Paris of 1898, most of its industries were taken over by American industrialists. Cheap labor was provided by Puerto Ricans who depended on the nation's agriculture as their only source of income.\n\nOn August 8, 1899, Hurricane San Ciriaco, with winds of over 100 miles per hour, struck Puerto Rico and, on August 22, another hurricane followed. The floods, caused by 28 days of continuous rain, damaged the agricultural industry and left 3,400 dead and thousands of people without shelter, food or work. As a result, there was a shortage of sugar from the caribbean in the world market and a huge demand for the product from Hawaii and other sugar producing countries. To meet the demand, plantation owners began a campaign to recruit the jobless laborers in Puerto Rico.\n\nOn November 22, 1900, the first group of Puerto Ricans consisting of 56 men, began their long journey to Maui, Hawaii. The trip was long and unpleasant. They first set sail from San Juan harbor to New Orleans, Louisiana. Once in New Orleans, they were boarded on a railroad train and sent to Port Los Angeles, California. From there they set sail aboard the Rio de Janeiro to Hawaii. According to the \"Los Angeles Times\" dated December 26, 1901, the Puerto Ricans were mistreated and starved by the shippers and the railroad company. They arrived in Honolulu, on December 23, 1900, and were sent to work in one of the different plantations owned by the \"Big Five\" on Hawaii's four islands. By October 17, 1901, 5,000 Puerto Rican men, women and children had made their new homes on the four islands. Records show that, in 1902, 34 plantations had 1,773 Puerto Ricans on their payrolls; 1,734 worked as field hands and another 39 were clerks or overseers (foremen).\n\nThe \"Big Five\" was the name given to a group of sugarcane corporations that wielded considerable political power in the Territory of Hawai‘i and leaned heavily towards the Hawai‘i Republican Party. The \"Big Five\" consisted of Castle & Cooke, Alexander & Baldwin, C. Brewer & Co., Amfac and Theo H. Davies & Co..\n\nThe owners of the \"Big Five\" were Euro-Americans who would indulge in discrimination and bigotry against ethnic groups who worked the plantations. They had an association called the \"Hawaiian Sugar Planters Association\" (HSPA) whose power could be considered as equivalent to an oligarchy. The Attorney General of Hawai‘i, referring to the Big Five, said in 1903, \"There is a government in this Territory which is centralized to an extent unknown in the United States, and probably almost as centralized as it was in France under Louis XIV.\" Wages and living accommodations depended upon their job and race. Europeans were paid more and received better quarters. Most of the workers moved from plantation to plantation to work because they did not like the work they did and because of the racial discrimination.\n\nAccording to the State of Hawaii Data Book 1982, by the year 1910, there were 4,890 Puerto Ricans living in Hawaii. Puerto Rico and Hawaii were unincorporated and incorporated territories of the United States respectively; however, the passage of the Jones–Shafroth Act of 1917, the same year that the United States entered World War I, granted American citizenship to the Puerto Rican resident in Puerto Rico and excluded those who resided in Hawaii. Yet, the \"non-citizen\" Puerto Ricans were assigned draft numbers and were expected to serve in the military.\n\nThe Plantation owners, like those that comprised the \"Big Five\", found territorial status convenient, enabling them to continue importing cheap foreign labor; such immigration was prohibited in various other states of the Union. In 1917, Puerto Ricans in the island, believing that they were entitled to the same rights that every other U.S. citizens had, tried to sign up to vote in a local Hawaiian election and were denied their rights by the county clerk who claimed that early immigrants to Hawaii were not covered by the Jones Act.\n\nManuel Olivieri Sanchez, a court interpreter at the time, became enraged in what he viewed as a violation of the civil rights of his fellow countrymen. He encouraged his fellow Puerto Ricans to protest by telling them that \"If you are not allowed to vote, don't answer the draft call\". Olivieri Sanchez led a legal battle for the recognition of the Hawaiian Puerto Ricans as citizens of the United States. In the first legal battle the lower court ruled in favor of the county clerk, however Olivieri Sanchez did not give up the fight and took the case before the Territorial Supreme Court, which reversed the decision of the lower court, granting the Puerto Ricans of Hawaii their United States citizenship.\n\nOlivieri Sanchez' victory was not welcomed by members of HSPA, who depended on the cheap labor non-citizens provided. In 1930, HSPA began to circulate false rumors, they made it be known that they (HSPA) were planning to recruit laborers in Puerto Rico, while at the same time they had the \"Honolulu Star Bullentin\" and some local newspapers they controlled run anti-Puerto Rican stories, that—for example—claimed Puerto Ricans were \"unhealthy hookwormers who had bought disease to Hawaii\".\n\nIn December 1931, Olivieri Sanchez wrote a letter to the editor of the \"Hawaiian Advertiser\" where he stated that he saw all of the rhetoric as a tactic by HSPA to push all the different ethnic groups in the local labor force back to work on the plantations. He was right, the HSPA wanted to persuade the United States Congress to exempt the territory from a law, which in 1924 was requested by California to prevent the migration of Filipinos and Japanese nationals to the U.S. (National Origins Quota Action (Immigration Act) and Johnson Immigration Act of 1924). HSPA's secretary treasurer claimed that the association was unwilling to import Puerto Ricans to Hawaii. His defamation of Puerto Ricans condemned not only the Puerto Ricans of Hawaii, but also those on the island of Puerto Rico. Despite the efforts of Olivieri Sanchez, HSPA had their way and Hawaii was exempted from the stern anti-immigration laws of the time.\n\nThe power of the plantation owners was finally broken by the activist descendants of the original immigrant laborers. Because it was recognized that they were born in an incorporated United States territory and that they were legal American citizens with full local voting rights and therefore were entitled to actively campaign for statehood recognition of the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nCurrently, there are over 30,000 Puerto Ricans or Hawaiian-Puerto Ricans living in Hawaii. Puerto Rican culture and traditions are very strong there. One of the traditions that is still practiced is the \"compadrazgo\". When a person baptizes somebody's child, he or she becomes the \"padrino\" (godfather) of the child and the \"compadre\" or \"comadre\" of the child's parents. There is a relationship of respect, mutual affection and obligation between the child, parents and compadres. The children ask for a blessing \"La Bendición\" and the padrinos respond with a \"Dios te bendiga\" (God bless you).\n\nAs in Puerto Rico, the Hawaiian-Puerto Ricans enjoy the preparation of the pasteles (meat pies) during the Christmas holidays. The confection of the pastel is an event where the whole family participates. Some of the members of the family cut the green bananas and season them while others prepare the masa (dough). The masa is then filled with seasoned pork and cilantro and then wrapped in banana or ti leaves and tied with a string. It is then cooked in boiling water. Once ready, the pastel is unwrapped and eaten.\n\nWhen the Puerto Ricans immigrated to Hawaii they took along with them their music and their musical instruments. Among the musical instruments introduced to Hawaii was the Puerto Rican cuatro. The Cuatro was a four stringed guitar developed in Puerto Rico in 1875; however, it eventually evolved into a ten stringed guitar. Other musical instruments introduced were the\nMaracas, a rattle containing dried seeds and the Guiro (percussion instrument made out of a gourd and played with a scraping stick). Soon, these instruments were not only limited to playing Spanish songs but, were also absorbed by the typical songs of Hawaii. Cachi Cachi music is a genre of music which began in Hawaii in the early 1900s when the Puerto Ricans immigrated to Hawaii.\n\nIn 1998, Master guitarmaker William R. Cumpiano and his colleagues wrote, directed and produced \"\"Un Canto en Otra Montaña: Música Puertorriqueña en Hawaii\"\" (\"A Song Heard in Another Mountain: Puerto Rican Music in Hawaii\"), a short-feature video documentary on the music and social history of the century-old Puerto Rican Diaspora in Hawaii.\nThe following table is in accordance to the U.S. Census 2000 Data for the State of Hawaii.\n\nDuring the late 20th century, the \"coquí\", a thumbnail-sized tree frog endemic to Puerto Rico, became established in Hawaii, most likely as stowaways in shippings of potted plants. Its loud mating call, \"music to the ears\" of Puerto Ricans on their native highland, is considered an annoyance in Hawaii where this invasive species reaches much higher population densities. Unsuccessful efforts were made to exterminate the infestation.\n\nSome of the Hawaiian-Puerto Ricans who have distinguished themselves are:\n\n\n"}

MSDN Magazine named it as one of the Ten Must-Have utilities for developers, and Scott Hanselman listed it as part of his \"Big Ten Life and Work-Changing Utilities\".\n\n.NET Reflector was the first CLI assembly browser. It can be used to inspect, navigate, search, analyze, and browse the contents of a CLI component such as an assembly and translates the binary information to a human-readable form. By default Reflector allows decompilation of CLI assemblies into C#, Visual Basic .NET, C++/CLI and Common Intermediate Language and F# (alpha version). Reflector also includes a \"Call Tree\" that can be used to drill down into intermediate language methods to see what other methods they call. It will show the metadata, resources and XML documentation. .NET Reflector can be used by .NET developers to understand the inner workings of code libraries, to show the differences between two versions of the same assembly, and how the various parts of a CLI application interact with each other. There are a large number of add-ins for Reflector.\n\n.NET Reflector can be used to track down performance problems and bugs, browse classes, and maintain or help become familiar with code bases. It can also be used to find assembly dependencies, and even windows DLL dependencies, by using the Analyzer option. There is a call tree and inheritance-browser. It will pick up the same documentation or comments that are stored in xml files alongside their associated assemblies that are used to drive IntelliSense inside Visual Studio. It is even possible to cross-navigate related documentation (codice_1), searching for specific types, members and references. It can be used to effectively convert source code between C# and Visual Basic.\n\n.NET Reflector has been designed to host add-ins to extend its functionality, many of which are open source. Some of these add-ins provide other languages that can be disassembled too, such as PowerShell, Delphi and MC++. Others analyze assemblies in different ways, providing quality metrics, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, dependency structure matrices or dependency graphs. It is possible to use add-ins to search text, save disassembled code to disk, export an assembly to XMI/UML, compare different versions, or to search code. Other add-ins allow debugging processes. Some add-ins are designed to facilitate testing by creating stubs and wrappers.\n\n.NET Reflector was originally developed by Lutz Roeder as freeware. Its first versions can be tracked back to January 2001. On 20 August 2008, Red Gate Software announced they were taking responsibility for future development of the software.\n\nIn February 2010 Red Gate released .NET Reflector 6 along with a commercial Pro edition that enabled users to step into decompiled code in the Visual Studio debugger as if it were their own source code.\n\nOn 10 January 2011 Red Gate announced that .NET Reflector 7 would incorporate Jason Haley's PowerCommands add-in.\n\nOn 1 February 2011 Red Gate announced that .NET Reflector would become a commercial product as of version 7, which was released on 14 March 2011. This led to the creation of several free alternatives, including dotPeek, CodeReflect and the open source program ILSpy. Subsequently, on 26 April 2011, due to community feedback Red Gate announced that they would continue to make .NET Reflector 6 available for free to existing users (while new users will have to pay for Reflector).\n"}

He served in the United States Navy (in which he was a bantamweight boxing champion), and led several field explorations of the U.S. Geological Survey. In academia, he was a member of the faculty of Harvard University, University of Minnesota, University of California, Los Angeles, and lastly University of California, Santa Barbara. He was best known for his work on the geologic time scale and the origin of life on Earth, and as a pioneering ecologist and environmentalist. He was credited with coining the term \"biogeology.\" His works on the significance of Cambrian fossils in the 1940s led to the development of the concept \"Cambrian explosion,\" for which he coined the phrase \"eruptive evolution.\"\n\nCloud was born in West Upton, Massachusetts. He was the third of seven children of Preston Ercelle and Pauline L. (\"née\" Wiedemann) Cloud. His father was an engineer-draftsman, and his mother, a genealogist. He grew up in Waynesboro, Pennsylvania where he developed a love for the outdoors. He enjoyed Scouting and was an Eagle Scout. Upon graduating from Waynesboro High School in 1929, Cloud spent three years in the United States Navy (1930–1933) where he excelled at boxing. He was the bantamweight champion of the Pacific Fleet Scouting Force. Due to the Great Depression, he could not join university, and attended night school at George Washington University, so that he could self-support by doing odd jobs during daytime. Ray S. Bassler, his geology professor and Curator of Geology at the U.S. National Museum, helped him to get manual jobs in the museum. Because of his keen interest in paleontology, he was given a job as a preparator in the paleontology laboratory under G. Arthur Cooper. It was Cooper who guided him to have his first technical publication on Devonian brachiopods from Illinois in 1938. In 1937 he earned his BSc degree, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He enrolled for PhD at Yale University graduate school in geology the same year. Working on the major systematic monograph on a group of Paleozoic brachiopods, under the supervision of C. O. Dunbar, he received his doctorate in 1940. His thesis directly earned him the A. Cressey Morrison Prize in Natural History of the New York Academy of Sciences, and was published by the Geological Society of America as Special Paper 38 in 1942.\n\nIn the summer of 1939, Cloud worked as field assistant to A. Lincoln Washburn on Victoria Island in western Arctic Canada. For the rest of the year he taught at the Missouri School of Mines in Rolla. During 1941 to 1942 he returned to Yale University to continue work on brachiopod evolution as a Sterling Research Fellow. At the height of World War II, he was recruited to the United States Geological Survey to work on the wartime Strategic Minerals Program. He embarked on a field party to investigate manganese deposits in Maine during the summer of 1941. In 1943, he joined Virgil Barnes of the Texas Bureau of Economic Geology in the Ellenburger Project, studying the stratigraphy and sedimentology of this important early Paleozoic carbonate complex. He became chief of party for bauxite investigations in Alabama.\n\nAfter the war, in 1946, Cloud was appointed as Assistant Professor of Paleontology and Curator of Invertebrate Paleontology at Harvard University. In 1948 he returned to the U.S. Geological Survey to become chief of the Branch of Paleontology and Stratigraphy. He was chief of party to map and investigate the geology of Saipan in the Mariana Islands in the western Pacific. He became Chief Paleontologist from 1949 to 1959. In 1961 he was appointed as Chairman of the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Minnesota. He established the School of Earth Sciences at that university, becoming its first Head. In 1965 he moved to the University of California, Los Angeles, as Professor of Biogeology, jointly with the Institute of Geophysics and the Department of Geology. In 1968 he transferred to the University of California, Santa Barbara campus, as full Professor. At UCSB he founded the Preston Cloud Research Laboratory, originally dedicated to paleomicrobiology and to studies of the first lunar geological samples from the Apollo 11 space mission. In addition, between 1974 and 1979 he was again a member of the U.S. Geological Survey based in Santa Barbara. He retired in 1974, but continued as Professor Emeritus. He spent the rest of his life at UCSB.\n\nCloud was a member of the National Academy of Sciences for thirty years, he was chairman of the Geology Section and occupied positions in its Council and Executive Committee. In 1967-69 he headed the Academy's \"Committee on Resources and Man,\" whose alarming report \"Resources and Man\" introduced to a wider public, among other things, the work on energy-resources of his friend M. King Hubbert, and the Hubbert peak theory of Peak oil production. He also gave the Hadean geologic eon, Earth's earliest, its name, using the Greek word for the Underworld to refer to a molten state of constant heat.\n\nCloud was the author of over 200 scientific and lay publications. Notably, his 1978 book, \"Cosmos, Earth, and Man: A Short History of the Universe\", written for a general readership, has been called 'one of the first and finest presentations of \"a more ample and more coherent picture of the world\"' (Alles), and his 1988 \"Oasis in Space: Earth History from the Beginning\" a \"comprehensive work of synthesis and reflection... a documented history of the earth and life on it... and an impressive capstone to his remarkable scholarship\" (Crowell).\n\nOne of Cloud's scientific heirs, his nephew John P. Grotzinger, is the Project Scientist for the NASA Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover Mission Team.\n\nIn 1990 special volume titled “Proterozoic Evolution and Environments” was published in the \"American Journal of Science\" in honour of Cloud's works.\n\nUniversity of California, Santa Barbara has a graduate student award named Preston Cloud Memorial Awards, which is given annually and carries minimum $200 for first-time attendance at a national or major meeting of a professional organization such as the Geological Society of America, American Geophysical Union, Association of American Petroleum Geologists, or for a student presenting a talk at such a meeting for the first time.\n\nPreston Cloud was the first scientist to systematically recognise the importance of the rich fossils of the Cambrian rocks in evolutionary terms. In order to explain the somewhat sudden appearance of diverse animals during the Cambrian Period, he invented the term \"eruptive radiation\" in his 1948 paper. According to him, the earlier use of the term like \"explosive\" was misleading because the actual evolution could occur over a period of millions of years, and it \"probably did not make a loud noise,\" he described, as implicated by the term. He postulated that adaptive radiation in any favourable ecological condition could always result in diversification of an original population into several distinct lineages, thus giving rise to eruptive evolution. Although his innovative thinking was largely ignored at the time, extensive research on the Cambrian fauna since the late 1970s, such as the fossils of the Burgess Shale, has established that the bio-geological event is a true documentation of the evolutionary origins of the animals, especially the body plans of modern animals.\n\nCloud was a noted public speaker and symposium participant on the subjects of resources, the human future, origin of life and the primitive earth, and he regularly delivered many popular lectures.\n\nCloud was of small stature, and with a rather Asian-like complexion. During his service in World War II, as D. L. Peck, Director of the U.S. Geological Survey, noted in a letter dated January 29, 1941: \"[Preston Cloud] created quite a stir among the locals who suspected that this person of slight stature, emerging from holes in the ground, must certainly be a Japanese spy in their midst.” At 5'6\", he would often put his desk and chairs on 4-inch-high raisers so that, as he claimed, he could look down on others to show his authority.\n\nCloud was an ardent humanist.\n\nIn graduate school, Preston was engaged to Mildred Porter. When Preston resigned from Harvard, they were divorced. In his time at Washington, he married Frances Webster, with whom he had three children, Karen, Lisa, and Kevin. The family moved to Minnesota in 1961, and though Preston and Frances were amicably divorced in 1965, two years later Preston relocated the entire family to Santa Barbara, California when he accepted a professorship at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\nIn Santa Barbara, Preston met and, in 1973, married Janice Gibson, an opera singer and mother of three children, Morgan, Dante, and Amanda. Preston and Janis remained together for the remainder of his life. Preston Cloud died at home, on January 16, 1991, of pneumonia, brought on as a complication of Lou Gehrig's disease.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2285578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2285578", "title": "Rice v. Cayetano", "text": "Rice v. Cayetano\n\nRice v. Cayetano, 528 U.S. 495 (2000), was a case filed in 1996 by Big Island rancher Harold \"Freddy\" Rice against the state of Hawaii and argued before the United States Supreme Court. In 2000, the Court ruled that the state could not restrict eligibility to vote in elections for the Board of Trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs to persons of Native Hawaiian descent.\n\nRice was represented by attorney John Goemans. John Roberts (who would later become the Chief Justice of the United States) argued for Ben Cayetano, the governor of Hawaii at the time.\n\nThe February 2000 court ruling in \"Rice v. Cayetano\" encouraged Hawaiian sovereignty opponents to file a similar lawsuit, \"Arakaki v. State of Hawai‘i\", months later. As the \"Rice\" case resulted in non-Hawaiians being allowed to vote in OHA elections, the \"Arakaki\" case resulted in non-Hawaiians being allowed to stand as candidates in OHA elections.\n\nBeginning in 1978, Hawaii held statewide elections for the trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA), an agency charged with disbursing particular funds and benefits to those who may be classified as \"Native Hawaiians\" (\"any descendant of not less than one-half part of the races inhabiting the Hawaiian Islands previous to 1778\"), or those who may be classified simply as \"Hawaiian\" (\"any descendant[s] of the aboriginal peoples inhabiting the Hawaiian islands ... in 1778, and which peoples thereafter have continued to reside in Hawaii\"). By law, only Native Hawaiians or Hawaiians could vote for, or be elected to, this Board of Trustees. \nHarold F. Rice was a rancher of European descent whose family had resided in Hawaii since the mid-19th century. In March 1996, he attempted to register to vote for the OHA trustees. Where that application asked for confirmation that \"I am also Hawaiian and desire to register to vote in OHA elections,\" Rice scratched out the words \"am also Hawaiian and\" and checked \"Yes.\" Denied eligibility because he was not Hawaiian, Rice sued under the 14th and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe District Court for the State of Hawaii ruled against Rice, due to its conclusion (as summarized by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals) that \"the method of electing OHA trustees meets constitutional standards for the essential reason that the restriction on the right to vote is not based on race, but upon recognition of the unique status of native Hawaiians that bears a rational connection to Hawaii's trust obligations.\" The District Court held that the OHA does not sufficiently resemble a typical government bureau, with governmental powers, and that it is \"carefully constrained by its overall purpose to work for the betterment of Hawaiians.\"\n\nThe 9th Circuit Court of Appeals also denied Rice's claim. For one thing, Rice contended that the legal status of an eligible voter is contingent solely upon race, and that Hawaii's contention that such status is a political designation, rather than a racial one, is an obvious effort to circumvent the Constitution with semantics. The Court of Appeals agreed that it might indeed be the case that the political designation is a racial designation under the state's statute, yet \"the constitutionality of the racial classification that underlies the trusts and OHA is not challenged in this case. This means that we must accept the trust and their administrative structure as we find them, and assume that both are lawful.\" Because Rice had not challenged the OHA's very existence, which is predicated on a racial classification, the Court could assume that \"the state may rationally conclude that Hawaiians, being the group to whom trust obligations run and to whom OHA trustees owe a duty of loyalty, should be the group to decide who the trustees ought to be.\" Thus, despite an apparent racial classification for eligibility to vote, within the context of the OHA's creation and mandate, the classification is actually \"not primarily racial, but legal or political.\"\n\nFurthermore, the Court of Appeals decided that the OHA trustee election was a \"special purpose election\" such as that upheld in \"Salyer Land Co. v. Tulare Water District\" (1973). In that case, the election for directors of a certain \"special purpose water district\" was limited to landowners in that district. The weight of a landowners vote was proportional to the amount of land that was owned, and thus seemed to contradict the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection clause. The Court held that because these landowners were disproportionately affected by the policies of the water district directors, and that such directors existed for a \"limited purpose\" and exhibited a \"lack of normal governmental authority,\" the districts did not violate the Constitution when they denied a vote to those who did not own land in the district, and granted votes proportionally to the amount of land owned. The elections for the OHA Board of Trustees is similar to that of the water district directors, in that \"the vote is for the limited purpose of electing trustees who have no governmental powers and perform no governmental purposes.\" Also, because Hawaiians, as defined by statute, are those disproportionately affected by the OHA, the vote for its trustees may be limited to them. Thus this exception to the 14th Amendment was used to justify the Hawaiian voting scheme under objections based on the 15th Amendment.\n\nFinally, the Court of Appeals concluded that \"the voting restriction for trustees is rooted in historical concern for the Hawaiian race ... carried through statehood when Hawaii acknowledged a trust obligation toward native Hawaiians ... and on to 1993, when Congress passed a Joint Resolution 'apologiz[ing] to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the people of the United States for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii ... and the deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians to self-determination'.\" Thus the 9th circuit held that native Hawaiians were entitled to \"special treatment\" much like the special treatment accorded Native American Indians in \"Morton v. Mancari\", where \"preferential treatment that is grounded in the government's unique obligation toward Indians is a political rather than a racial classification, even though racial criteria may be used in defining eligibility.\"\n\nRice appealed to the Supreme Court. There, he would argue that in addition to being a naked violation of the Constitution on its face, the eligibility requirements subverted the original intended purpose of the public lands as written in the Annexation and Organic Acts, both of which granted subsequent benefits to all \"inhabitants\" of Hawaii, regardless of race. The elections do not qualify as \"special purpose\" under \"Salyer\", nor does the eligibility requirement denote a political rather than racial classification. Finally, the protection under \"Morton v. Mancari\" is inappropriate. The Petitioner would deny that there is any \"special relationship\" at all, for there is no \"former sovereign\" or \"historical relationship\" clause in the Constitution, and the analogy with Indian tribes thus has no legal standing.\n\nThe State of Hawaii disagreed. For them, whether the elections qualified as \"special purpose\" or contained explicit racial qualifications for participation were secondary concerns. The native Hawaiian people had a \"special relationship\" with the United States, indeed a sort of semi-sovereign status, analogous to that of native Indian tribes, which affords them a large measure of self-determination. They would seek to demonstrate that this status had been legitimized repeatedly by Congress, though it had never been made explicit by treaty or codified in the U.S. Constitution. No matter, because the Court would be sharply reminded that granting such status falls within the powers of Congress, not the Courts, and that the understanding was legitimized by ample precedent and circumstances.\n\nIn order to understand this extraordinary defense, some background is necessary. The Kingdom of Hawaii was an independent, sovereign nation from 1810 until 1893. Throughout this period, the increasing economic interests of American businessmen began to clash with the interests of the Hawaiian government. In 1887, under the threat of violence, the Kingdom's Prime Minister was compelled to resign, and a new Constitution was implemented. This heavily curtailed the administrative power of the monarchy. When Queen Lili'uokalani took steps in 1893 to counter this imposition, she was overthrown in a coup d'état by the Committee of Safety which was composed of white businessmen, missionaries and colonists (both Hawaiian citizens and foreign nationals). The Committee set up a provisional government led by themselves, and the next year declared the existence of the Republic of Hawaii. In 1898, the Republic accepted annexation by the United States, and when President McKinley signed the Annexation and Organic Acts soon thereafter, Hawaii became a U.S. Territory. At this time, of land, formerly overseen by the crown, were ceded to the United States. The Annexation Act stipulated that all revenues and proceeds from the use of this public land would \"be used solely for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands for educational and other purposes.\" The Organic Act similarly held that all \"funds arising from the sale or lease or other disposal ... shall be applied such uses and purposes for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Territory of Hawaii.\"\n\nSeeing the subsequent cultural and economic decline of Hawaii's native population, in 1920 the U.S. Congress passed the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act (HHCA), which placed 200,000 of those acres under the authority of said Commission, such that they could be leased by Native Hawaiians for token sums. A \"Native Hawaiian\" was defined as \"any descendant of not less than one-half part of the blood of the races inhabiting the Hawaiian Islands previous to 1778.\" That date, 1778, is the year in which Captain Cook \"discovered\" the islands, and thus the date of the first known Western presence.\n\nWhen Hawaii became a state in 1959, it was agreed that the state would include the HHCA in its own Constitution, including the specific definition of Native Hawaiian. In 1978 the state Constitution was amended to provide for the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA), which would hold the lease on those lands not already under the purview of the HHCA. The OHA lands would be similarly held in a \"trust\" managed for the benefit of Native Hawaiians.\n\nFor the Petitioner, the relevant history of Hawaii begins with the Annexation Resolution, not in the previous era of sovereignty. Claims of sovereignty based upon the status or political standing of Natives prior to the 1893 coup are both mistaken and irrelevant. The Petitioner's Brief notes that at the time of their transfer, \"these 'public lands' were held by the Republic of Hawaii free and clear of any encumbrances or trust obligations. None of the former citizens of the Hawaiian kingdom held any cognizable interest in these lands\" (3). To support this claim the Petitioner notes that only the Monarch enjoyed title to \"Crown lands.\" When these lands were ceded by the Republic of Hawaii to the United States, the Resolution stipulated that these lands would \"be used solely for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands for educational and other public purposes.\" (Emphasis added by Petitioner). The Petitioner would use population statistics up through the turn of the 20th century to show that the Kingdom of Hawaii had been \"consciously multiracial,\" and thus the term \"inhabitants\" referred to numerous races, including Westerners. Furthermore, the date of 1778 had obviously been chosen for the eligibility requirements because \"it marks the last days of what might be characterized as the era of relative 'racial purity' in the Hawaiian Islands.\" (25). Any claim of a connection between that date and sovereignty status for native Hawaiians is bogus, for the Kingdom of Hawaii did not exist until 1810. Also, during the era of the Hawaiian kingdom, many who would not qualify as Hawaiian under the OHA statute were, in fact, full citizens of the Kingdom. In particularly strong terms, the OHA is denounced for using a \"blood quantum\" to define eligibility status, a requirement that is \"disturbingly reminiscent of the 'Blood Protection' and 'Citizenship' laws adopted as part of the infamous Nuremberg Laws\".\nThe Petitioner also denies that \"Salyer\", with its \"special limited purpose\" exception to the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection clause, is appropriate in this case. First, because \"Salyer\" dealt with land ownership, and not race, it does not apply to begin with. The 9th Circuit Court thus made a grievous error when it determined that this case was \"'not the sort [of election] that has previously triggered Fifteenth Amendment analysis'.\" (Pet. Br. 18). Such a determination would \"create an infinitely elastic loophole\" in which anyone could circumvent the 15th amendment by simply claiming that the purposes of any such election was \"limited.\" The Petitioner quotes \"Terry v. Adams\" (1953), which held that the 15th Amendment's prohibition of race-based election laws \"included any election in which public issues are decided or public officials selected.\" (19) Furthermore, \"Salyer\" is an inappropriate defense under the 15th Amendment because it was decided as an exception to the 14th Amendment, due to that amendment's \"one man, one vote\" rule. Thus, it cannot be applied to the 15th Amendment's explicit ban on race-based qualifications. The Petitioner quotes from \"Gomillion v. Lightfoot\" (1960) to illustrate that the 15th Amendment is absolute, no matter how carefully constructed the means to a racially discriminatory end. That case concerned a district in Alabama that had been drafted such that it excluded all potential non-white voters. Though race was mentioned nowhere in the statute, it had been struck down due to the clearly racially discriminatory result. Quoting \"Lane v. Wilson\" (1939) as well, the Petitioner notes that the 15th Amendment \"'nullifies sophisticated as well as simple-minded modes of discrimination'\" and goes on to say that \"In contrast to the purportedly race-neutral grandfather clauses, white primaries, and gerrymanders invalidated in the foregoing cases, the OHA voting restriction is startlingly 'simple-minded'. Hawaii closes its election booth to anyone who fails its racial test\" (16).\n\nThe OHA cannot be justified on the grounds that enfranchisement is limited to those who are the interested parties, for the same logic could have been applied to the \"Gomillion\" gerrymander case. \"Both constitute attempts to achieve a 'racially pure' voting bloc justified on the ground that the right to vote has merely been limited to those 'primarily affected' by the decisions of the elected officials.\" Besides, the entire concept of an exception under \"Salyer\" is inapplicable in the first place, even if it did constitute an exception to the 15th as well as the 14th amendment. This is because the \"'disproportionate effect' prong requires, at a minimum, that the costs of those activities be borne disproportionately by those granted the right to vote ... the \"Salyer\" exception, therefore, cannot be applied to the OHA, a state agency that expends substantial funds drawn from taxes paid by all citizens of Hawaii without regard to race\" (20). Because those state officials chosen in OHA elections \"manage and spend both legislative appropriations and public lands proceeds, it is axiomatic that all Hawaiian citizens ... have a legitimate interest in the proper management of those funds\" (20-21). Furthermore, the comparative wealth of those funds and the \"sweeping\" authority with which the OHA manages them, along with the numerous and government-like programs that it administers, render the comparison between a small water storage district and the OHA untenable.\n\nMore controversially, the Petitioner discounts the idea that there is a \"compelling state interest\" in limiting the OHA elections based on the history the State's relationship with native Hawaiians (i.e., in order to protect against current discrimination or offset the effects of past discrimination). \"Nothing in the record demonstrates ... the existence of any past or present discrimination against racial 'Hawaiians'.\" (31). The Petitioner sarcastically notes that \"The Respondent now takes the position that the State of Hawaii has a compelling interest in engaging in blatant discrimination today – and indefinitely into the future – in order to make up for even-handed treatment of all Hawaiian citizens, regardless of race, in the past\" (32). Nor may a compelling interest be inferred from the necessity for the State to uphold its \"trust\" relationship with the natives, for the Supreme Court \"has never held that a legislatively declared 'trust' relationship suffices to justify racial discrimination in voting\" (31). Furthermore, the use of \"Morton v. Mancari\" to illustrate the nature of that implied \"special relationship\" has no bearing on Hawaii. For one thing, in recognizing that the Constitution's Indian Commerce and Treaty Clauses denotes such a relationship for Indian Tribes, \"Morton v. Mancari\"'s outcome \"was expressly predicated on the fact that the challenged preference involved a tribal, rather than racial, classification\" (39). More importantly, native Hawaiians do not constitute a federally recognized Indian Tribe. The Petitioner notes that the 1867 treaty which ceded Alaska included a clause by which all inhabitants would be given U.S. citizenship \"with the exception of the uncivilized native tribes.\" By contrast, the Organic Act of 1900, which granted territorial status to Hawaii, provided citizenship to \"all persons who were citizens of the Republic of Hawaii\" in 1898. This, of course, included native Hawaiians; the Petitioner then points out that, in fact, these Native Hawaiians \"were the dominant political group in Hawaii for several decades after annexation, and were well represented in all forms of public office\" (43). Thus the \"special relationship\" or \"trust\" based on tribal sovereignty no bearing on the situation in Hawaii.\n\nNaturally, the Respondent did not agree. After reiterating that the voting qualifications are political rather than racial, and that the elections qualify for \"limited purpose\" and \"disproportionate effect\" exceptions, the Respondent turns quickly to the heart of the matter: the \"special relationship.\" Though native Hawaiians are not formally recognized as an Indian tribe, Congress and the Court have \"recognized a special obligation to America's first inhabitants and their descendants ... and have recognized that Congress is empowered to honor that obligation as it sees fit\" (Res. Br. 2). Because Congress has explicitly noted that such an obligation pertains to Alaskan Natives, despite their distinction from traditional Indian tribes of the lower 48 states, it naturally follows that this distinction extends to Hawaiian natives as well. For the Petitioner to rely on the literal wording of treaties signed at the turn of the 20th century misses the point entirely. Indeed, by 1898, \"the era of treaty-making with the indigenous people of the American continent had come to an end,\" and this is why there is no mention of such a distinction in the Annexation Act (6). Yet, with the creation of the HHCA in 1921, \"Congress has recognized that it has a special relationship with indigenous Hawaiians, and has sought to enable them to benefit in some measure from their homelands\" (6). The Respondent goes on to quote Congress' contemporary assertion that the HHCA \"affirm[ed] the trust relationship between the United States and the Native Hawaiians\" (42 U.S.C. § 11701 (13)) as well as the statement that \"In recognition of the special relationship which exists between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people, [it] has extended to Native Hawaiians the same rights and privileges accorded to American Indian, Alaska Native, Eskimo, and Aleut communities\" (20 U.S.C. § 7902(13)) (both as quoted in Respondent's Brief, 8-9).\n\nSpecial attention is given to the 1993 Joint Resolution of Congress known as the \"Apology Resolution,\" which expressed regret for the role of the United States in the 1893 coup and \"the deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians to self-determination.\" The Respondent further notes that \"The [apology resolution] specifically acknowledged that 'the health and well-being of the Native Hawaiian people is intrinsically tied to ... the land', that land was taken from Hawaiians without their consent or compensation, and that indigenous Hawaiians have 'never directly relinquished their claims ... over their national lands'.\" (8). The Respondent cites numerous other Congressional utterances that refer to \"special\" or \"trust\" relationships, or which refer to Native Hawaiians as \"distinct\" or \"unique\" indigenous peoples. In creating the OHA and the voting requirements thereof, Hawaii was simply \"reaffirming the 'solemn trust obligation and responsibility to native Hawaiians'.\" (Res. Br. 9). The fact that Congress has consistently recognized and appropriated funds to the OHA implicitly affirms its legitimacy. So does the recognition that the \"constitution and statutes of the State of Hawaii ... acknowledge the distinct land rights of the Native Hawaiian people as beneficiaries of the public lands trust ... [and] reaffirm and protect the unique right of the Native Hawaiian people to practice and perpetuate their cultural and religious customs, beliefs, practices, and language\" (42 U.S.C. § 11701 (3) as quoted in Res. Br. 11). In addition, the Hawaiian Constitution was amended in 1978 to include the OHA after an affirmative vote open to all citizens of the State.\n\nFinally, given the active role that the U.S. Legislature has taken in affirming the \"special relationship,\" and the plenary power given to Congress in acknowledging tribal status (explicitly delegated, in this instance, to the State of Hawaii), it is not appropriate for the Court to deny its existence of that status, or to determine its terms. \"Classifications based on Congress' decision to assume a special trust relationship with an indigenous people are not based on race, but rather the unique legal and political status that such a relationship entails,\" and, furthermore, \"the Framers of the Constitution drew no distinctions among different groups of indigenous people in conferring [such] power ... on Congress, and the Framers of the Civil War Amendments never envisioned that those amendments would restrict the ability of Congress to exercise that power\" (Res. Br. 14). In other words, by relying on a literal interpretation of said amendments or tribal classifications, the Petitioner was, again, missing the point.\n\nThe Supreme Court sided with the Petitioner. In a 7-2 decision based entirely on the 15th Amendment, they reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, with Justices Stevens and Ginsburg dissenting. Justice Kennedy wrote the opinion for the Court, which was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, and Justices O'Connor, Scalia and Thomas. They note that the 15th Amendment is certainly not bound by the language or circumstances surrounding its enactment, and that it is \"quite sufficient to invalidate a scheme which did not mention race but instead used ancestry in an attempt to confine and restrict the voting franchise\" (16). After all, \"ancestry can be a proxy for race. It is that proxy here\" (18). The structure of the OHA elections is \"neither subtle nor indirect. It is specific in granting the vote to persons of defined ancestry and to no others\" (17). The Respondent's argument that \"descendants ... of [the] aboriginal peoples\" does not mean the same thing as \"descendants ... of the races\" is \"undermined by its express racial purpose and by its actual effects\" (20). As for \"Morton v. Mancari\", were Hawaii's voting restrictions to be sustained under that authority, \"we would be required to accept some beginning premises not yet established in our case law\" (22). Regardless: \"Even were we to take the substantial step of finding authority in Congress, delegated to the State, to treat Hawaiians or native Hawaiians as tribes, Congress may not authorize a State to create a voting scheme of this sort\" — that is, one that uses race as an eligibility requirement (22). The 15th Amendment is absolute even under such conditions, for the election of OHA trustees is still a State election, to which the Amendment clearly applies. Nor is the restriction based on beneficiary status rather than race, for \"although the bulk of the funds for which OHA is responsible appears to be earmarked for the benefit of 'native Hawaiians', the State permits both 'native Hawaiians' and 'Hawaiians' to vote\" — that is, both those who qualify with a 50% blood quantum and those who qualify as descendants of residents in 1778 — and \"[this] classification thus appears to create, not eliminate, a differential alignment between the identity of OHA trustees and what the State calls beneficiaries\" (27). Yet, again, such details are irrelevant to the Court, for \"Hawaii's argument fails on more essential grounds ... [i.e.] the demeaning premise that citizens of a particular race are somehow more qualified than others to vote on certain matters. That reasoning attacks the central meaning of the Fifteenth Amendment\" (27). The Court's opinion ends with a brief lecture to the State of Hawaii, concluding with the observation that Hawaii must \"seek the political consensus that begins with a sense of shared purpose. One of the necessary beginning points is this principle: The Constitution of the United States, too, has become the heritage of all the citizens of Hawaii\" (28).\n\nJustice Breyer, in a concurring opinion joined by Justice Souter, elaborates on the problematic analogy between the OHA and a trust for the benefit of an Indian tribe. For Breyer, such a trust does not exist for native Hawaiians under the circumstances, mainly because the OHA electorate \"does not sufficiently resemble an Indian tribe\" (2). The OHA's hereditary requirement of an ancestor living in Hawaii in 1778 might include persons with \"1 possible ancestor out of 500, thereby creating a vast and unknowable body of potential members\" (4). This, Breyer believes, goes well beyond any \"reasonable\" definition of tribal status.\n\nJustice Stevens' dissent, joined in part by Justice Ginsburg, takes a much more charitable view of the \"special relationship\" between Hawaii and the United States, believing that \"two centuries of Indian law precedent\" alone justifies the OHA's voting laws under the Constitution, for \"there is simply no invidious discrimination present in this effort to see that indigenous peoples are compensated for past wrongs\" (3). He agrees with the Respondent that under \"Morton v. Mancari\" preferential treatment is justified if such treatment \"can be tied rationally to the fulfillment of Congress' unique obligation towards the Indians\" (5). Such obligations, Stevens believes, are implicit in the Apology Resolution of 1993, in addition to the more than 150 \"varied laws passed by Congress ... [which] expressly include native Hawaiians as part of the class of Native Americans benefited\" (7). Like the Respondent, Stevens believes that to reject the State's claims because native Hawaiians are not technically a \"tribe\" is to miss the point. There is a \"compelling similarity, fully supported by our precedent, between the once subjugated, indigenous peoples of the continental United States and the peoples of the Hawaiian Islands\" (8). In addition, Stevens points out that tribal membership alone was not the \"decisive factor\" when the Court upheld preferential treatment in \"Morton v. Mancari\". In that case, the preference \"not only extended to non-tribal member Indians, it also required for eligibility ... a certain quantum of Indian blood\" (9). Thus, there is no tribal limitation concerning the Federal Government's authority over considerations for native peoples. \"In light of this precedent,” Stevens continues, \"it is a painful irony indeed to conclude that native Hawaiians are not entitled to special benefits designed to restore a measure of native self-governance because they currently lack any vestigial native government – a possibility of which history and the actions of this Nation have deprived them.\" As for Breyer's concurring opinion, Stevens succinctly dismisses the objection that the OHA's definition of native is not \"reasonable\" by noting simply that \"this suggestion does not identify a constitutional defect\" (9).\n"}

It was the successor of the defunct Northern Spirit FC, a semi professional soccer club based in North Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales. Northern Spirit entered the National Soccer League in the 1998–99 season. Its founding was inspired in part by the success Perth Glory was enjoying as a mainstream club (as opposed to the league's mainstay European migrant founded clubs), as well as an opportunity to tap into the previously unrepresented northern suburbs of Sydney.\n\nOn the field, the club had early success in the National Soccer League, reaching the finals in its first attempt, but the next two seasons were not nearly as successful, the club finishing 13th in both of them. The club recovered somewhat to finish mid-table in its last 3 seasons, but only managed to make the finals once more, in 2002/03.\nDuring Northern Spirit's first season, then Crystal Palace owner Mark Goldberg bought a 31 per cent stake in the club and secured an option for a further 35 per cent. Beset by Palace's financial problems, he relinquished his option to a group of players and coaches including Graham Arnold, Robbie Slater and Ian Crook. The club was later owned by Rangers for a small period of time. Rangers temporarily changed the club's home colours to their own royal blue.\n\nNorthern Spirit's home games were played at North Sydney Oval and their first league home game (against Sydney Olympic) attracted a then Australian club soccer record crowd (for a non finals match) of 18,985 a record which stood until 2005 when it was broken by Queensland Roar crowd of 20,725 (a record subsequently broken by other games). In the club's final season, Chairman Antonio Gelonesi decided to move the club to Pittwater Park, on Sydney's Northern Beaches. The decision was motivated mainly by money, with North Sydney Oval not drawing enough people to make a profit. The 23,000 capacity Brookvale Oval, a rectangular rugby league venue (home of the Manly-Warringah club) which is located roughly halfway between North Sydney Oval and Pittwater Park, was considered as a possibility for the new home but was eventually overlooked by the Spirit.\n\nAfter enduring financial problems for much of its existence, the club folded after the 2003/2004 NSL season.\n\nThe former youth teams of Northern Spirit were assembled into the new Gladesville-Hornsby Football Association, nicknamed Spirit FC, in 2004.In 2019 GHFA merged with North West Sydney Women's Football Association to form North West Sydney Football Ltd. NWSF has its homeground at Christie Park in Macquarie Park, New South Wales. In 2007, won the NSW State League Division 1 premiership, but were not selected to be promoted. In 2008, they again won the State League Division 1 and this time were promoted to the Super League for 2009.\n\nIn 2013, Football NSW incorporated the National Premier Leagues structure to their competition. GHFA Spirit FC were selected along with 11 other teams to join the new second division of soccer in NSW.\n\nThe 2015 season saw Spirit FC crowned premiers of the NPL NSW 2, however due to NSW's promotion criteria, were not eligible.\n\n\n"}

Doe, 538 U.S. 84 (2003), was a court case in the United States which questioned the constitutionality of the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act's retroactive requirements. Under the Act, any sex offender must register with the Department of Corrections or local law enforcement within one business day of entering the state. This information is forwarded to the Department of Public Safety, which maintains a public database. Fingerprints, social security number, anticipated change of address, and medical treatment after the offense are kept confidential. The offender's name, aliases, address, photograph, physical description, driver's license number, motor vehicle identification numbers, place of employment, date of birth, crime, date and place of conviction, and length and conditions of sentence are part of the public record, maintained on the Internet.\n\n\"Smith v. Doe\" questioned the constitutionality of the act's retroactive requirements. John Does I and II were convicted of aggravated assault before the act's passage and filed suit, claiming the act was punitive and violated the \"ex post facto\" clause of Article I of the U.S. Constitution. The district court ruled against the Does, ruling that the act was nonpunitive. The appeals court sided with the Does that the act was in fact punitive and violated ex post facto.\n\n\"Held\": Because the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act is nonpunitive, its retroactive application does not violate the ex post facto clause.\n\nThe question is if the intention was to impose a punishment or \"civil proceedings\". If the intention was to punish, that ends the inquiry. If the intention was to enact a regulatory scheme that is civil and nonpunitive, the Court must examine whether the scheme is so punitive as to negate the State's intention to deem it civil. Because the Court ordinarily defers to the legislature's stated intent, only the clearest proof will suffice to override that intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty. The Court decided 6–3 that the legislature's intent was to create a civil, nonpunitive program to protect the public and that the resulting dissemination of the registration information was not significant enough to declare as debilitating.\n\nThe dissenting justices contended that the law was punitive and imposed severe deprivations of liberty. Justice Stevens' dissenting opinion said, \"It is also clear beyond peradventure that these unique consequences of conviction of a sex offense are punitive. They share three characteristics, which in the aggregate are not present in any civil sanction. The sanctions (1) constitute a severe deprivation of the offender's liberty, (2) are imposed on everyone who is convicted of a relevant criminal offense, and (3) are imposed only on those criminals. Unlike any of the cases that the Court has cited, a criminal conviction under these statutes provides both a sufficient and a necessary condition for the sanction\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2285611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2285611", "title": "Franconian Switzerland", "text": "Franconian Switzerland\n\nFranconian Switzerland () is an upland in Upper Franconia, Bavaria, Germany, and a popular tourist retreat. Located between the River Pegnitz in the east and the south, the River Regnitz in the west and the River Main in the north, its relief, which reaches 600 metres in height, forms the northern part of the Franconian Jura (\"Frankenjura\").\nAs several other mountainous landscapes in the German-speaking lands, e.g. Holstein Switzerland, Märkische Schweiz, or Pommersche Schweiz, Franconian Switzerland was given its name by Romantic artists and poets in the 19th century who compared the landscape to Switzerland. The Franconian Switzerland is famous for its high density of traditional breweries.\n\nThe region was once called \"Muggendorfer Gebürg\" (\"Muggendorf hills\"). The first tourists arrived during the age of Romanticism. Two law students of Erlangen University, Ludwig Tieck and Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder have been credited as \"discoverers\" of the region. The episode \"Eine Reise in die Fränkische Schweiz\" in their joint production \"Franz Sternbalds Wanderungen\" (Berlin, 1798) enthralled many contemporaries. The 1820 book \"Die kleine Schweiz\" (\"Little Switzerland\"), written by Jakob Reiselsberger of Waischenfeld, gave the region its name. In 1829, a book by German salesman and local historian Joseph Heller, \"Muggendorf und seine Umgebung oder die Fränkische Schweiz\" (\"Muggendorf and its surrounding or the Franconian Switzerland\") was published.\n\nThe description \"Switzerland\" was common during the 19th century for landscapes with mountains, valleys and most significantly rocks, e.g., Saxon Switzerland, Marcher Switzerland, Mecklenburg Switzerland and Holstein Switzerland.\n\nFranconian Switzerland is the northern part of the Franconian Jura. It is often loosely defined as the region bounded by the rivers Main to the north, Regnitz to the west and Pegnitz to the east or by the motorways of the A 70 to the north, A 9 to the east and A 73 to the west. However, the actual region of Franconian Switzerland is only the catchment area of the River Wiesent.\n\nThe region covers parts of the counties of Bamberg, Bayreuth and Forchheim. Its best known settlements include Pottenstein, Gößweinstein, Muggendorf, Ebermannstadt, Streitberg, Egloffstein, and Waischenfeld.\n\nIts boundaries are Obermainland (north), Erlangen (south), Bayreuth (east), Forchheim (west), and Bamberg (northwest).\n\nInformation about Franconian Switzerland may be found \"inter alia\" in the Franconian Switzerland Museum in Tüchersfeld with its comprehensive regional collections. It is housed in the so-called Jew's Court (\"Judenhof\") below two steep rock pinnacles.\n\nThe following 18 municipalities across 2 counties belong to the Franconian Switzerland Trade Association (\"Wirtschaftsverband Fränkische Schweiz\"):\n\nIn the White Jurassic period, about 161 million to 150 million years ago, a shallow sea lay across the whole of southern Germany. During this period, thick rock sequences were deposited on the seabed as the earth's crust constantly sank. The landscape of Franconian Switzerland is strongly influenced by the resulting limestone and dolomite rocks of the White Jurassic. It is a typical karst landscape with deeply incised river valleys and dry, arid plateaus. Many fossils, especially ammonites, may be found in the limestone strata.\n\nIn the late Jurassic period, uplifting of the European continental plate caused the sea to recede and larger areas of land formed at the beginning of the subsequent Cretaceous period. During this time there was a tropical climate and there was intense weathering of limestone and dolomite rocks. During the Cretaceous a sea again advanced into the region of the Franconian Switzerland.\n\nIn the Tertiary period, the sea receded again due to local uplifting and partially exposed the Jurassic landscape.\n\nThe most prominent peak is commonly known as \"Walberla\", a table hill east of Forchheim. Its official name is the Ehrenbürg. The Ehrenbürg consists of two peaks, the Rodenstein (532 m) and the Walberla (512 m). On the hilltop is its namesake, the small Walburgis Chapel, first mentioned in a 1360 manuscript. There is an annual festival on the hilltop on 30 April, the birthday of Saint Walburga, which attracts thousands of people.\n\nOther popular high points are as follows:\nThe rocks of Franconian Switzerland's mountains and hills are popular for rock climbing. With more than 6,500 routes it is one of the best developed climbing areas in the world.\n\nImportant climbing areas are as follows:\n\nThere are countless caves in Franconian Switzerland, of which the Devil's Cave (Teufelshöhle) near Pottenstein is the most famous. The region is a typical example for a Karst topography.\n\nAccessible caves are as follows: \n\nFranconian Switzerland is located along the so-called Castle Road (\"Burgenstraße\"), which connects more than 70 castles, palaces and fortresses between Mannheim and Prague. Most of these castles were constructed in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe following castles and castle ruins can be visited:\n\nFranconian Switzerland is the origin of the so-called \"Osterbrunnen\". It describes the colorful decoration of public water wells during the Easter season. During the time of modernization and the construction of canalization, this custom had lost its significance. Only in the early 1980s, it was rediscovered and in 1986 169 villages again decorated their water wells. Today, more than 200 villages decorate their village well with coloured easter eggs. The main reason for this custom is probably the significance of water for the arid high plateau of Franconian Switzerland. The \"Bieberbach Osterbrunnen\" (Egloffstein) was admitted to the Guinness Book of Records as \"the largest Osterbrunnen of the world\".\n\nFranconian Switzerland is one of the oldest tourist regions in Germany. The first travelers arrived at the beginning of the 19th century. The most attractive tourist locations are the many caves.\n\nA large range of outdoor activities is possible in the area. Beside countless hiking paths the area is popular for its great rock climbing and canoeing options. Most important is however the impressing nature, which should be preserved by every visitor.\n\nHome to the annual Frankonian Switzerland Marathon, beginning in Forchheim and slowly climbing to Sachsenmühle-Wende, then back to Ebermannstadt, the area includes 375 km of some of the best trails for running, Nordic walking, and rambling in Germany maintained by the European-Community-funded Running Experience Project which was launched in July 2011.\n\nThe Franconian Switzerland Steam Railway (\"Dampfbahn Fränkische Schweiz\") or DFS is a museum railway based in Ebermannstadt that operates steam and diesel specials on Sundays and on public holidays.\n\n\n\n"}

He also made back-to-back final table appearances in the first two Poker Million events. His first major win came in January 2004 when he won the Australasian Poker Championship in Melbourne, collecting a first prize of around A$420,000 ($320,000, £180,000).\n\nBloom won the £5,000 No Limit Hold'em VC Poker Cup Final in London on 5 August 2005 and won the £200,000 ($351,401) first prize.\n\nHe also had a fourth-place finish in the 2005 World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions. He was a member of the winning British team in the Poker Nations Cup. \n\nAs of 2008, his total live tournament winnings exceed $1,500,000. Bloom won A$600,000 for his second-place finish in the High Rollers Challenge, event 8 of the Australian Poker Millions tournament held in Melbourne in Jan 2009.\n\nBloom fell short of the million pound grand prize in the Poker Million IX event held in London on 10 December 2010. He finished second behind Gus Hansen.\n\nBloom is believed to have accumulated wealth through developing online gambling and gaming websites, and through property and start-up investments.\n\nSince 2009, Bloom has been the chairman of Brighton & Hove Albion, who are currently a Premier League club, having gained promotion in the 2016–17 season after 34 years out of the top flight of English football. \n\nHe succeeded Dick Knight after securing a 75% shareholding in the club and investing £93 million in the development of the club's new ground, Falmer Stadium. Since the stadium has been built, it has received numerous extensions in spectator capacity and has received funding to ensure that it is \"Premier League ready\" by installing floodlights, amongst other minor features.\n\nUpon taking over the club, Bloom declared his love of the game, \"I've been a football fan and a gambler since the age of about seven or eight. My interest in both developed at the same time.\" Bloom is a longtime fan of Brighton and his family has had a long association with the club: his uncle Ray is a director and his grandfather, Harry, was vice-chairman during the 1970s. \n\nOn becoming chairman, Bloom appointed former Uruguay international Gus Poyet as manager, and together they led the team to promotion from Football League One as champions in 2011, the season before Brighton moved into their new home - the Falmer Stadium. Poyet left the club in 2013 after losing in a play-off semi-final to Crystal Palace. In June 2013, Bloom appointed Óscar García as the new head coach of the club; Garcia resigned after losing a second successive play-off semi-final to Derby County and left the club in May 2014. The next manager was former Liverpool player Sami Hyypiä, who only lasted a few months in the managerial role after a poor start to the 2014–15 season left Brighton in the relegation zone. Chris Hughton became manager towards the end of 2014, and the club have been successful since. \n\nHughton steered Albion to safety in their 2014–15 campaign, and then guided the club to a 3rd-place position in the Championship in the following season, missing out on promotion to Middlesbrough on goal difference. The club would be defeated in the play-off semi final, for the third time in four years, this time to Sheffield Wednesday. \n\nBrighton went one step further in the 2016–17 season under Hughton's management and Bloom's ownership, finishing 2nd in the Championship and gaining promotion to the Premier League for the first time in the club's history. Bloom backed Hughton in the following transfer window, breaking several record transfer fees to improve the squad, readying Brighton's first Premier League season. On 13 May 2019, immediately after the end of the season, with the club ending at the 17th position and thus securing its top-tier status for the coming season, Bloom released a statement to the effect that \"it was time for a change\" and sacked Hughton, replacing him with Championship's Swansea coach Graham Potter. \n\nIn 2018, Bloom completed the takeover of Belgian second division club Union SG.\n\nBloom is Jewish, and has contributed significantly to the development of a synagogue project in Hove. He stepped in with the Brighton and Hove Hebrew Congregation suffering financial problems, and the funding for the development will come from his Bloom Foundation, of which he is the chairman.\n\n"}

Gladesville is located 10 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Ryde and the Municipality of Hunter's Hill.. Gladesville is part of the federal electorates of North Sydney and Bennelong.\n\nGladesville prides itself on its riverside views and bush settings along the Parramatta River. The nearby Gladesville Bridge, a Sydney landmark that links the North Shore to the Inner West takes its name from the suburb.\n\nThe Gladesville area was home to Indigenous Australians before European settlement. Evidence of their presence can still be found in the area, for example rock carvings and grinding grooves that can be seen in Glades Bay Park, overlooking Glades Bay.\n\nThe area was first called Doody’s Bay when European settlement began with a land grant being made to convict artist, John Doody in 1795. Others to receive grants in the district were William House (1795), Ann Benson (1796) and Charles Raven (1799). By 1836, John Glade, an emancipist, was issued with the deeds to Doody’s grant, which he had purchased in 1817. Glade expanded his property with the purchase of a number of adjoining holdings. After John Glade’s death in 1848, his land was sold to a Sydney solicitor, Mr W. Billyard, who subsequently subdivided and sold the land in November 1855, naming it Gladesville.\n\nA major milestone in the development of the suburb was the establishment of the Tarban Creek Lunatic Asylum in 1838, on the banks of the Parramatta River. It was the first purpose-built mental asylum in New South Wales. Much of the architecture was designed by Colonial Architect Mortimer Lewis and built between 1836 and 1838. In 1869 it became the Gladesville Hospital for the Insane, and in 1915 the Gladesville Mental Hospital. In 1993, it was amalgamated with Macquarie Hospital to form the Gladesville Macquarie Hospital. In 1997, inpatient services were consolidated at Macquarie Hospital at North Ryde. The Gladesville complex includes many buildings which are listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register and the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate.\n\nOne of the hospital's acquisitions was a two-storey sandstone house called The Priory, in Salter Street. It was built in the late 1840s, possibly by the Stubbs family, and featured an east-looking face in the Georgian style, and a west face with a gable and painted sundial. In the 1850s it was sold to the Marist Fathers, a French group who had an influence on the early development of Hunters Hill. The hospital acquired it in 1888; it was listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate in 1978.\nAnother historical landmark is the cottage Rockend, where the poet Banjo Paterson lived in the 1870s and 1880s. It was built circa 1850 and is still preserved and open to the public in Banjo Paterson Park, Punt Road. It is listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate. The site joins the Bedlam Bay walk, where remnants of the Great North Road exists and the walls of the Bedlam Bay Ferry. Banjo Paterson lived in the sandstone house (now a restaurant) whilst attending Sydney Grammar School. The house was owned by his Grandmother and was frequented by many artists and writers. Banjo Paterson recalled in his radio interview in 1935 the river had declined and was now lined with factories. However he could still remember when;\nHalmeg Linseed oil was manufactured on a Mill located at the end of Punt Road, overlooking Looking Glass Bay. The linseed oil was used in the manufacture of lead paint and varnish, as well as putties, caulking compounds, printing inks and linoleum. The production plant was established in 1923. The revolutionary extraction process did not work at first. Despite this, one hundred guests toured the new mill at its official opening. Harold Meggit, owner of the plant, increased employees wages, also advising that there would be no jobs, no wages if a new solution to distil the oil could not be found. The employees put forward hundreds of suggestions, and two were implemented, producing the finest linseed oil in the industry. In later years, Halmeg was the first to produce Safflower Oil in Australia. It also introduced a profit sharing scheme for its employees. The site closed in 1974. In 2016 the local community crowned Madeleine Paslis as the Queen of Gladesville. \nGladesville has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\nThere are four primary schools in the suburb: Gladesville Public School, Our Lady Queen of Peace Catholic Primary School, Christ Church Gladesville Preschool and Boronia Park Public School. Gladesville is closeby to a number of prestigious private schools. Riverside Girls High School is a short distance away from Gladesville, located in the suburb of Huntleys Point. St Joseph’s College (Boys) and Villa Maria Primary School is located in Hunters Hill, Holy Cross College (Boys) in Ryde and Marist Sisters' College Woolwich (Girls) is located near the peninsula of Woolwich. These schools are easy to access from Gladesville and are the main sources of education for the young Gladesville population. Ryde Secondary College is located nearby in Ryde.\n\nAt the 2016 census, there were 11,827 residents in Gladesville. The majority of people (64.9%) stated they were born in Australia, with other top responses being China 3.9%, England 3.2%, Italy 2.2%, New Zealand 1.8% and India 1.1%. 69.2% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 3.4%, Italian 3.4%, Cantonese 2.9%, Greek 2.6% and Spanish 1.3%. Catholic (33.1%) was the most common religious affiliation, followed by No Religion 27.3% and Anglican 11.7%.\\\n\nGladesville is an affluent suburb. The largest three groups of occupations were Professionals (32.8%), Managers (19.1%), and Clerical and Administrative Workers (15.1%). The median weekly incomes for Gladesville were significantly higher than that of Australia, being Personal: $934.00, Family: $2,515.00, and Household: $1,922.00.\n\nThe dwelling types in Gladesville were evenly spread between separate houses and semi-detached or units. Median monthly mortgage payments were $2,500 and this was higher than the national median of $1,755.\n\nGladesville is serviced by a commercial district centering on Victoria Road, the suburb's main thoroughfare, and by a small shopping centre (Gladesville Shopping Village) located off Cowell Street. A number of restaurants are situated within the commercial parts of Gladesville, and serve a variety of foods including Thai, Indian, Vietnamese, Greek, Mexican and Italian. Entertainment venues include the Bayview & Sawdust Hotels (now closed) as well as the Gladesville RSL Club.\n\nPlans to redevelop the site by Hunters Hill Council (including the removal of an important local heritage building) remain strongly opposed by some local residents. Despite complaints by many local residents to preserve the existing mix of boutique shopping and low density housing, the local municipal council has committed the suburb to high density residential redevelopment and strip mall shopping centres.\n\n\nA number of bus services run along Victoria Road, between the Sydney CBD and Ryde, with some services continuing as far as Parramatta. Bus services along Pittwater Road connect with Chatswood and Woolwich.\n\nHuntleys Point ferry wharf (also known as Gladesville Ferry Wharf) is in the neighbouring suburb of Huntleys Point.\n\n"}

A softkey often takes the form of a screen-labeled function key located alongside a display device, where the button invokes a function described by the text at that moment shown adjacent to the button on the display. Soft keys are also found away from the display device, for example on the sides of cellular phones, where they are typically programmed to invoke functions such as PTT, memo, or volume control. Function keys on keyboards are a form of soft key. In contrast, a hard key is a key with dedicated function such as the keys on a number keypad.\n\nScreen-labeled function keys are today most commonly found in kiosk applications, such as automated teller machines and gas pumps. Screen-label function keys date to aviation applications in the late 1960s. Kiosk applications were particularly common in the 1990s and 2000s. Screen-labeled function keys are found in automotive and aviation applications such as in the primary flight and multi-function displays. An alternative to screen-labeled function keys is buttons (virtual keys) on a touchscreen, where the label is directly pushable. The increased prevalence of touchscreens in the 2000s has led to a decrease in screen-labeled function keys. However, screen-labeled function keys are inexpensive and robust, and provide tactile feedback.\n\nEarly examples are found in aviation glass cockpits, such as the Mark II avionics of the F-111D in the late 1960s/early 1970s (first ordered 1967, delivered 1970–73). Hewlett-Packard developed them for use in computers/calculators in the 1970s. The HP 9830 desktop computer was the first calculator with two rows of 4 keys, over which a paper overlay would be placed. These were later adapted to terminals. Programmers found that the HP 2640 terminals could lock the top two lines of the screen, so they displayed the key functions there. Starting with HP 2647 terminal, the keys were re-arranged to correspond with 2 pairs of 4 labels at the bottom of the screen. These could be programmed by escape sequence or configuration screen. This would be further developed on the failed HP 300 Amigo, which used keys at the right side of the screen and HP 250 business computers which placed them at the bottom. By arranging functions in hierarchical trees, many functions can be implemented with only 8 keys.\n\n, HP calculators use this arrangement to implement hierarchical trees of functions. They are rarely found on PC applications, even though the first IBM PC BASIC labeled function key use at the bottom of the screen, and there were 12 function keys, patterned after use on IBM terminals.\n\nModern Texas Instruments calculators such as the TI-89 series use function keys to open drop-down menus on their menu bar, the menu title acting like the key label.\n\nCasio calculators use the function keys for a menu at the bottom of the screen.\n\nA typical mobile phone with soft keys has them located beneath the bottom left and bottom right of the display; some, especially those made by Nokia, have an additional center soft key, activated by pressing on the center of the directional pad. Depending on the modality of the application, various functions can be mapped onto it. It can also bring up multiple functions listed on a pop-up expanded menu. Usually the prompt text on the display for the softkey is not allowed to be truncated or omitted with ellipsis. The softkey itself is usually not printed with a functional icon or text, but is often marked with a dot or short bar.\n\nSoft keys have become increasingly rare as touchscreens take the place of function keys on many modern smartphones.\n\nScreen-labeled function keys have found use in point of sale systems; NCR Corporation claims that their \"DynaKey\" system \"has been proven to reduce training time and cashier errors\".\n\n"}

It began in 1985 and is now the largest annual event of its type in Sydney's Northern District, attracting over 80,000 people each year. The festival is held on and around Eastwood Oval on the third Saturday of October to commemorate 19th-century pioneer Maria Ann \"Granny\" Smith, credited with producing the Granny Smith apple and celebrated for providing the Ryde-Hunters Hill area with prosperity. The festival begins at 9:00 am and concludes at 8:30 pm.\n\nThe highlights are the Grand Parade down Rowe Street and the fireworks display. There are also stalls, community events, live entertainment, and rides. It is a festival tradition that the New South Wales Mounted Police lead the Grand Parade.\n\nThe Granny Smith Festival in 2007 was of particular significance, in that it became a major campaign venue for the Australian federal election, 2007. For the first time in the Festival's 22-year history, it was officially opened by the (then) local Member of parliament, Prime minister John Howard. There were speculations that his appearance was largely due to the emergence of a serious challenge towards not just his Coalition government, but indeed his very own parliamentary seat of Bennelong, from high-profile ALP candidate Maxine McKew. Apart from Howard and McKew, a number of other local politicians, along with hundreds of volunteers representing numerous political parties and interest groups, attended the Festival, with a large contingent of media crew following their campaign trails.\n\nThe 2008 Granny Smith Festival was of important significance with the Ryde by-election being held on the same day, Saturday October 18. This was triggered by the resignation of John Watkins who was the MP for Ryde since 1995. An estimated 280 stores were set up in the 2008 event.\n\n\n\n"}

It opened in June 1901 and was replaced by the Haymarket North Extension in April 1975.\n\nThe Charlestown Elevated began at the Canal Street Incline, just north of Haymarket Square in the Bulfinch Triangle section of downtown Boston, Massachusetts. It paralleled the Causeway Street Elevated north to North Station just south of Boston Garden. There it turned east along Causeway Street to Tower C, the split with the Atlantic Avenue Elevated, then north over the Charlestown Bridge.\n\nThe Elevated turned slightly with an elevated station at City Square, then followed Main Street through Charlestown with a station at Thompson Square. Sullivan Square, the original terminal, was a grand arched brick building with multiple streetcar loops. The Sullivan Square Shops, one of the line's two maintenance facilities, was located just north of Sullivan Square. From there, the line turned northeast and crossed the Mystic River on a high bridge, then slowly descended to the ground-level Everett station.\n\nBuilding of the elevated began in 1899 and it opened for revenue service on June 10, 1901. Stations were located at North Union Station (soon renamed as North Station), City Square, and Sullivan Square, with a major maintenance facility at Sullivan Square. The Atlantic Avenue Elevated opened on August 22, 1901, connecting to the Charlestown Elevated east of North Station. Thompson Square opened as an infill station between City Square and Sullivan Square on May 22, 1902.\n\nWhen the Causeway Street Elevated was built in 1912, a platform was built at North Station for Atlantic Avenue Elevated shuttle trains so they would not block the main tracks. In 1917, the elevated was slated to be replaced with a more permanent subway line along the same Main Street routing, but this project was canceled by the US's entry into World War I.\n\nIn the 1910s and 1920s, the Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) had plans to extend the Charlestown Elevated to Malden, and the southern portion of this extension, including a drawbridge over the Mystic River, was built in the late 1910s. Everett station was opened in an isolated industrial area just north of the river crossing on March 15, 1919. Intended to be temporary and to be used only until full service to Malden was implemented, it was constructed of wood like a house rather than a permanent transit station. The light-duty construction style of this station was unique on the Elevated. Due to opposition from Malden residents who preferred a tunnel due to the noise and vibration of the planned elevated line, the Malden extension was not built and Everett remained the terminus.\n\nThe Atlantic Avenue Elevated operated only as a shuttle from South Station to the 1912-built North Station platform after 1928, and closed completely on September 30, 1938. It was demolished in 1942 to provide steel for the war effort, though a short section was left from Tower C for laying over trains from the Charlestown Elevated.\n\nUnlike the Washington Street Elevated, which was built as the same time with a similar design, the Charlestown El was located very near Boston Harbor and the Mystic River tidal estuary, and was thus continually exposed to accelerated corrosion caused by salt air. The elevated was also unpopular with many local residents, as it was noisy and blocked out sunlight to Main Street. In 1965, a promised removal of the elevated structure was part of a compromise deal by Edward J. Logue to secure local support of a planned redevelopment project.\n\nA replacement elevated was thus infeasible, while a full-length replacement tunnel would have been too expensive. Instead, the Haymarket North Extension project consisted of a tunnel segment from Haymarket through a new underground stop at North Station, then under the Charles River to a portal near Bunker Hill Community College. From there the extension was built along the Haverhill Line commuter rail right of way, lowering land acquisition difficulties. The Charlestown Elevated was closed at the end of afternoon rush hour service on April 4, 1975, and the Haymarket North Extension opened on April 7.\n\nThe Charlestown Elevated's infrastructure was demolished shortly after its closure. By the end of 1975, only North Station and Sullivan Square stations were standing in their original locations; they were demolished in 1976. Thompson Square station was lowered to the ground for restaurant use, but burned in 1976 before conversion could take place. The footings of the Mystic River bridge, just west of the Route 99 (Alford Street) road bridge, were not removed and remain extant . The elevated supports can also be seen in the center span of the Charlestown Bridge. Tower C, which was located at the split between the Charlestown Elevated and the Atlantic Avenue Elevated at the southern end of the Charlestown Bridge, was moved to the Seashore Trolley Museum.\n\n"}

{"id": "2285678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2285678", "title": "Victor Emmanuel II Monument", "text": "Victor Emmanuel II Monument\n\nThe Victor Emmanuel II National Monument () or (mole del) Vittoriano, called Altare della Patria (English: \"Altar of the Fatherland\"), is a national monument built in honour of Victor Emmanuel II, the first king of a unified Italy, located in Rome, Italy. It occupies a site between the Piazza Venezia and the Capitoline Hill. It is currently managed by the Polo Museale del Lazio and is owned by the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities.\n\nFrom an architectural perspective, it was conceived as a modern \"forum\", an agora on three levels connected by stairways and dominated by a portico characterized by a colonnade. The complex process of national unity and liberation from foreign domination carried out by King Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy, to whom the monument is dedicated, has a great symbolic and representative value, being architecturally and artistically centred on the Italian unification—for this reason the Vittoriano is considered one of the national symbols of Italy.\n\nIt also preserves the Altar of the Fatherland (), first an altar of the goddess Rome, then also a shrine of the Italian Unknown Soldier, thus adopting the function of a lay temple consecrated to Italy. Because of its great representative value, the entire Vittoriano is often called the \"Altare della Patria\", although the latter constitutes only a part of the monument.\n\nLocated in the centre of ancient Rome, and connected to the modern one by the streets that radiate from Piazza Venezia, it has been consecrated to a wide symbolic value representing a lay temple metaphorically dedicated to a free and united Italy—celebrating by virtue the burial of the Unknown Soldier (the sacrifice for the homeland and for the connected ideals).\n\nThe Vittoriano is located on the hill of the Capitoline Hill, in the symbolic centre of ancient Rome, and is connected to the modern one thanks to roads that radiate from Piazza Venezia.\n\nIts design is a neoclassical interpretation of the Roman Forum. It features stairways, Corinthian columns, fountains, an equestrian sculpture of Victor Emmanuel II, and two statues of the goddess Victoria riding on quadrigas. On its summit there would have been a majestic portico characterized by a long colonnade and two imposing propylaea, one dedicated to the \"unity of the homeland\", and the other to the \"freedom of the citizens\", concepts metaphorically linked to the figure of Victor Emmanuel II.\n\nThe base houses the museum of Italian Unification, and in 2007, a lift was added to the structure, allowing visitors to ride up to the roof for 360-degree views of Rome. This terrace, which is the highest of the monument, can also be reached via 196 steps that start from the portico.\n\nThe structure is wide, deep, and high. If the quadrigae and \"Winged Victorys\" are included, the height reaches . It has a total area of and possesses, due to the conspicuous development of the interior spaces, a floor area of .\n\nOne of the architecturally predominant elements of the Vittoriano are the external staircases, which are constituted in the complex by 243 steps, and the portico situated on the top of the monument, which is inserted between two lateral propylaea. The entrance stairway is wide and long, the terrace where the Altar of the Fatherland is located is wide. The maximum depth of the Vittoriano underground reaches below street level. The colonnade is formed by columns high and the length of the porch is .\nThe allegories of the monument mostly represent the virtues and feelings, very often rendered as personifications, also according to the canons of the neoclassical style, which animate the Italians during the Italian unification, or from the revolutions of 1820 to the capture of Rome (1870), through which national unity was achieved. Due to the complex process of unification undertaken by Victor Emmanuel II throughout the second half of the 19th Century, the Italians gave him the epithet of \"Father of the Fatherland\" (). The only non-allegorical work is the \"equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel II\", which is the architectural centre of the Vittoriano.\nThe monument, as a whole, appears as a sort of marble covering on the northern slope of the Capitoline Hill: it was therefore thought of as a place where it is possible to make an uninterrupted patriotic walk (the path does not in fact have an architectural end, given that the entrances to the highest part are two, one for each propylaeus) among the works present, which almost all have allegorical meanings linked to the history of Italy. Different are the vegetal symbols present, among which the palm, which recalls the \"victory\", the oak (the \"strength\"), the laurel (the \"victorious peace\"), the myrtle (the \"sacrifice\") and the olive tree (the \"concord\").\n\nFrom a stylistic perspective, the architecture and works of art that embellish the Vittoriano have been conceived with the aim of creating a \"national style\" to be replicated in other areas. It was designed to communicate the imperial splendours of ancient Rome. Above all, for the realization of the Vittoriano, Giuseppe Sacconi took inspiration from the Neoclassical architecture—the reborn heir of the classical Greek and Roman architecture, on which Italic elements were grafted and eclectic influences added.\n\nThe Vittoriano is regarded as a national symbol of Italy and every year it hosts important national celebrations. The largest annual celebrations are Liberation Day (April 25), Republic Day (June 2), and Armed Forces Day (November 4). During these celebrations, the President of Italy and the highest government officials pay tribute to the Italian Unknown Soldier and those who died in the line of duty by laying a laurel wreath.\n\nAfter the death of Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy on January 9, 1878, many initiatives were destined to raise a permanent monument that celebrated the first king of a united Italy, creator of the process of unification and liberation from foreign domination, which is indicated by historiography as \"Father of the Fatherland\" also due to the political work of the President of the Council of Ministers of the Kingdom of Sardinia Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour and to the military contribution of Giuseppe Garibaldi. The goal was therefore to commemorate the entire Italian unification season (\"Risorgimento\") through one of its protagonists.\n\nFor this purpose, the Italian government approved the construction of a monumental complex on the Northern side of Rome's Capitoline Hill. The monument would celebrate the legacy of the first king of a united Italy and would become a symbol of national patriotism. The project was realized by Giuseppe Sacconi in 1885, in an eclectic style.\n\nThe project by Giuseppe Sacconi was inspired by the Hellenistic sanctuaries, such as the Pergamon Altar and the Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia in Palestrina. The Vittoriano was conceived as a vast and modern \"forum\" open to citizens, situated on a sort of elevated square in the historic centre of Rome organized as an agora on three levels connected by tiers, with conspicuous spaces reserved for strolling visitors.\nTo erect the Vittoriano it was necessary, between the last months of 1884 and 1899, to proceed with numerous expropriations and extensive demolitions of the buildings that were located in the construction area. The place chosen was in the heart of the historic centre of Rome and was therefore occupied by ancient buildings arranged according to urban planning that dated back to the Middle Ages. This was considered necessary because the Vittoriano should have been built in the heart of the historic centre of Rome, in a modern urban context, in front of a new large square (the future Piazza Venezia), which at the time was just a narrow open space in front of Palazzo Venezia.\n\nThe general objective was also to make Rome a modern European capital that rivaled Berlin, Vienna, London and Paris overcoming the centuries-old pontifical town planning. In this context, the Vittoriano would have been the equivalent of the Brandenburg Gate of Berlin, the Admiralty Arch of London and the Opéra Garnier of Paris; these buildings are all united by a monumental and classical aspect that metaphorically communicates pride and the power of the nation that erected them.\n\nIt would then become one of the symbols of the new Italy, joining the monuments of ancient Rome and those of the popes' Rome. Having then been conceived as a large public square, the Vittoriano, in addition to representing a memorial dedicated to Victor Emmanuel II, was invested with another role—a modern \"forum\" dedicated to the new free and united Italy.\nEstablished Italian sculptors, such as Leonardo Bistolfi, Manfredo Manfredi, Giulio Monteverde, Francesco Jerace, Augusto Rivalta, Lodovico Pogliaghi, Pietro Canonica, Ettore Ximenes, Adolfo Apolloni, Mario Rutelli and Angelo Zanelli, made its sculptures nationwide. It was inaugurated on June 4, 1911, and completed in 1935. The partly completed monument was inaugurated on June 4, 1911, on the occasion of the Turin International world's fair and the 50th anniversary of Italian unification. Construction continued throughout the first half of the 20th Century; in 1921 the body of the Italian Unknown Soldier was placed in the crypt under the statue of goddess Roma, and in 1935, the monument was fully completed amidst the inauguration of the Museo Centrale del Risorgimento Italiano.\n\nThe decision to include an altar dedicated to the homeland in the Vittoriano was taken by Giuseppe Sacconi only after the planning phase, during the construction of the monument. The place and the dominant subject were immediately chosen, being a large statue of the goddess Rome that would have been placed on the first terrace after the entrance to the monument, just below the \"equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel II\". Thus, the Altar of the Fatherland, at least initially and before the burial of the body of the Unknown Soldier, was thought of as a chapel of the deity. In this way, the greatness and majesty of Rome was celebrated, elected to the role of legitimate capital of Italy. Within the Vittoriano are numerous artistic works that recall the history of ancient Rome.\nAfter the First World War the Vittoriano was chosen to house the tomb of the Unknown Soldier, or the burial of an Italian soldier who died during the First World War whose identity remains unknown due to the serious injuries that made the body unrecognizable, which represents all the Italian soldiers who died during the wars. The reason for his strong symbolism lies in the metaphorical transition from the figure of the soldier to that of the people and finally to that of the nation. This transition between increasingly broader and generic concepts is due to the indistinct traits of the non-identification of the soldier.\n\nThe Vittoriano was thus consecrated to a wide symbolic value representing a lay temple metaphorically dedicated to a free and united Italy—celebrating by virtue the burial of the Unknown Soldier (the sacrifice for the homeland and for the connected ideals).\n\nWith the rise of Fascism in 1922, the Vittoriano became the setting for the military parades of the authoritarian regime of Benito Mussolini. After World War II, with the institution of the Italian Republic in 1946, the monument was stripped of all its Fascist symbols and reassumed its original function as a secular temple dedicated to the Italian nation and its people. Throughout the second half of the 20th century, however, its significance as a symbol of national identity started to decline as the public opinion started to perceive it as a cumbersome relic representing a nation superseded by its own history. At the turn of the 21st century, Italy's President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi pushed for a revaluation of national symbols of Italy, including the Vittoriano.\n\nThe monument holds the Tomb of the Italian Unknown Soldier with an eternal flame, built under the statue of goddess Roma after World War I following an idea of General Giulio Douhet. The body of the unknown soldier was chosen on 28 October 1921 from among 11 unknown remains by Maria Bergamas, a woman from Gradisca d'Isonzo whose only child was killed during World War I. Her son's body was never recovered. The selected unknown was transferred from Aquileia, where the ceremony with Bergamas had taken place, to Rome and buried in a state funeral on 4 November 1921.\n\nHis tomb is a symbolic shrine that represents all the fallen and missing of the war. The side of the tomb of the Unknown Soldier that gives outward at the Altar of the Fatherland is always guarded by a guard of honour and two flames that burn perpetually in braziers. The guard is provided with military personnel of the various weapons of the Italian Armed Forces, which alternate every ten years.\n\nThe allegorical meaning of the perpetually burning flames is linked to their symbolism, which is centuries old, since it has its origins in classical antiquity, especially in the cult of the dead. A fire that burns eternally symbolizes the memory, in this case of the sacrifice of the Unknown Soldier moved by patriotic love, and his everlasting memory of the Italians, even in those who are far from their country. The two perennial braziers next to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is placed a plaque whose text reads \"Italians Abroad to the Motherland\" in memory of donations made by Italian emigrants between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century for the construction of the Vittoriano.\n\nThe Victor Emmanuel II National Monument is indicated with two other names: \"(Mole del) Vittoriano\" and \"Altare della Patria\", which are now the most used names to call the monument.\n\nFrom 1921, when the Unknown Soldier was buried under the statue of the goddess Rome in the part of the Vittoriano that is called \"Altare della Patria\", the expression began to indicate not only the place of burial of the soldier, or the personification of all the fallen and lost in war, but the whole structure due to the strong popular sentiment for the symbolic Unknown Soldier.\n\nSet against the external base of the Vittoriano, on the sides of the entrance to Piazza Venezia, are the \"fountains of the two seas\" which are dedicated to the Adriatic sea and the Tyrrhenian Sea. Both are inserted in a flower bed and possess, from the beginning, a hydraulic system that recycles the water avoiding waste. Historically, a water cistern was also active, then abandoned, located in the basement of the monument. The two fountains therefore represent the two major Italian seas and, therefore, in this perspective the Vittoriano is assimilated to the Italian Peninsula. This way the whole country is represented, even geographically.\n\nThe exterior staircases of the Vittoriano adapt to the ascending sides of the northern slope of the Capitoline Hill and lead, starting from the entrance of Piazza Venezia, to the terrace of the Altar of the Fatherland, then to the terrace of the redeemed cities (the one immediately below the colonnade of the portico), and finally to the terraces of the two propylaea flanked by the portico constituting the two entrances.\nAt the entrance, is an imposing staircase leading to the terrace of the Altar of the Fatherland and of the Italian Unknown Soldier, which represent the first raised platform of the Vittoriano, as well as its symbolic centre. The path along the staircase continues even beyond the tomb of the Unknown Soldier to symbolically represent a continuous and uninterrupted procession of Italians that continues its walk up to the highest point of the construction—the portico and the propylaea.\n\nThe artistic gate of access to the Vittoriano, which is the work of Manfredo Manfredi, has the particularity of being \"hidden\", that is, of being able to slide vertically underground due to tracks. The plant that allows the lowering of the railing, originally hydraulic, was considered at the time of its construction among the most technologically advanced in the world. The entrance gate has a length of and a weight of 10,500 tons.\n\nOn both sides of the entrance stairway, are a series of sculptures that accompany the visitor towards the Altar of the Fatherland. The first sculptures that meet are two sculptured groups in gilded bronze, with subjects inspired by the thought of Giuseppe Mazzini, \"The Thought\" and \"The Action\" (respectively, to the left and right of the staircase for those coming from Piazza Venezia), followed by two sculptural groups (also in this case one on each side) depicting as many \"Winged Lions\" and finally, on the top of the staircase, before the beginning of the terrace of the Altar of the Fatherland, two \"Winged Victorys\".\n\n\"The Thought\" and \"The Action\" have been fundamental in the Italian unification process, as they are necessary to change the course of history and to transform a society. The overall shape of the two sculptural groups recalls the intrinsic characteristics of the two concepts: \"The Action\" has a triangular and angular profile, while \"The Thought\" has a circular shape.\nThe two \"Winged Lions\" represent the initiation of the patriots who decide to join the Italian unification enterprise motivated by ardor and strength, which also control their instinctive side—otherwise the patriots would slide towards the obfuscation of their abilities if the instinct were left completely free. The \"Winged Victories\", in addition to recalling the military and cultural successes of the Roman era, symbolize allegorically the good luck of national unity.\n\nAt the end of the entrance stairway, immediately after the statues of the \"Winged Victories\", opens the terrace of the Altar of the Fatherland, the first raised platform of the Vittoriano, which is dominated centrally by the statue of the goddess Rome and the shrine of the Unknown Soldier. On the terrace of the Altar of the Fatherland are also the Botticino marble sculptural groups that symbolize the moral values of the Italians, or the ideal principles that make the nation firm. The four groups have a height of and are located to the right and left of the entrance to the terrace of the Altar of the Fatherland (two on each side), sideways to the statues of \"The Thought\" and of \"The Action\" and in correspondence of the fountains of two seas, along the parapets that overlook Piazza Venezia. The concepts expressed by these four sculptural groups, \"The Force\", \"The Concord\", \"The Sacrifice\" and \"The Right\", are the tangible emanation of \"The Thought\" and \"The Action\".\nAt the sides of the Altar of the Fatherland, the staircase resumes dividing into two symmetrical ramps parallel to the tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Both reach a pronaos where two large doors open (one on each side, both positioned symmetrically and laterally to the Unknown Soldier, and each in correspondence with one of the two propylaea) that lead to the interior spaces of the Vittoriano. Above each door are two statues; on the left door are \"The Politics\" and \"The Philosophy\", while on the right door are two statues depicting \"The War\" and \"The Revolution\".\n\nFrom the two shelves where the doors open to give access to the interior spaces, two further flights of stairs start that converge, directly behind the Altar of the Fatherland, towards the base of the \"equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel II\"—the latter is located on the second large elevated platform, in order of height, of the Vittoriano. Behind it, the stairway resumes its ascent in the direction of the portico, reaching a small shelf, from which two staircases start laterally leading to the entrance of a propylaeum. Before reaching the entrances of the propylaea, each of the two staircases is interrupted, creating a small intermediate shelf, which allows access to the terrace of the redeemed cities—the third large and last elevated platform of the Vittoriano—directly behind the \"equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel II\" and immediately below the colonnade of the portico.\n\nThe redeemed cities are those united to Italy following the Treaty of Rapallo (1920) and the Treaty of Rome (1924), peace agreements at the end of the First World War. These municipalities are Trieste, Trento, Gorizia, Pola, Fiume and Zara. Following the Paris treaties of 1947, Pola, Fiume and Zara moved on to Yugoslavia and, after the dissolution of the latter, to Croatia. After the conflict, Gorizia was divided into two parts—one part remained in Italy while the other, which was renamed \"Nova Gorica\", passed first to Yugoslavia and then to Slovenia. Each redeemed city is represented by an altar against the back wall, which bears the corresponding municipal coat of arms. The six altars were placed on the terrace between 1929 and 1930.\nAt the centre of the row of altars of the redeemed cities, engraved on the stylobate, is a monumental inscription carved on the occasion of the solemn ceremony of the Unknown Soldier (4 November 1921) which contains the text of the Victory Bulletin, an official document written after the Armistice of Villa Giusti with which the general Armando Diaz, supreme commander of the Royal Army, announced, on 4 November 1918, the surrender of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the victory of Italy in the First World War.\n\nAt the base of the text of the Victory Bulletin are two other altars similar to those of the redeemed cities but which have, instead of the municipal coat of arms of the municipalities, a helmet—these two altars bear the inscription \"\" on the left alter and \"\" on the right alter. They echo the Latin phrase \"et facere et pati fortia Romanum est\" (\"It is the attribute of a Roman to perform as well as to suffer mighty things\") written by Livy in the \"History of Rome, book 11; in the work the phrase is pronounced by Scaevola towards Lars Porsena.\n\nThe Altar of the Fatherland is the most famous part of the Vittoriano and is the one with which it is often identified. Located on the top of the entrance stairway, it was designed by the Brescian sculptor Angelo Zanelli, who won a competition specially held in 1906. It is formed from the side of the Tomb of Italian Unknown Soldier that faces the outside of the building (the other side, which faces inside the Vittoriano, is located in a crypt), from the \"sacellum\" of the statue of the goddess Rome (which is exactly above the tomb of the Unknown Soldier) and two vertical marble reliefs that descend from the edges of the aedicula containing the statue of the goddess Rome and which run downwards laterally to the tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\n\nThe statue of the goddess Roma present at the Vittoriano interrupted a custom in vogue until the 19th century, by which the representation of this subject was with exclusively warlike traits. Angelo Zanelli, in his work, decided to further characterize the statue by also providing the reference to Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom and the arts, as well as of war. The great statue of the deity emerges from a golden background. The presence of the goddess Roma in the Vittoriano underlines the irremissible will of the Unification of Italy patriots to have the Rome as the capital of Italy, an essential concept, according to the common feeling, from the history of the peninsula and the islands of Italian culture.\n\nThe general conception of the bas-reliefs located laterally to the statue of the goddess Rome, one to his left and the other to his right, recalls Virgil's \"Bucolics\" and \"Georgics\", which complete the triptych of the Altar of the Fatherland with the statue of the Roman divinity.\n\nThe allegorical meaning of the bas-reliefs that are inspired by the works of Virgil is linked to the desire to conceptually render the Italian soul. In the \"Georgics\", the reference to the \"Aeneid\" is in fact present, and in both the works the industriousness in the work of the Italians is recalled.\n\nThe bas-relief on the left of the Altar of the Fatherland represents the \"Triumph of Labour\" and the one on the right symbolizes the \"Triumph of the Patriotic Love\" where both converge scenically towards the statue of the goddess Rome.\n\nAfter the Altar of the Fatherland is the \"equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel II\", a bronze work by Enrico Chiaradia and architectural centre of the Vittoriano. The personifications of the noble Italian cities are carved on the marble base of the statue. The statue is bronze, high, long, and weighs 50 tons. Including the marble base, the entire sculptural group is high.\n\nThe \"equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel II\" is the only non-symbolic representation of the Vittoriano, given that it is the representation of the homonymous monarch. In classical antiquity the equestrian statues were aimed at the exaltation of the portrayed subject, whose warlike virtues were emphasized. Furthermore, riding and controlling a steed, the character's ability to control primordial instincts was communicated—in this way, the subject was also recognized as civic virtues.\n\nAlso the placement of the statue at the architectural centre of the Vittoriano, above the Altar of the Fatherland and in front of the colonnade of the portico, is not fortuitous—in classical antiquity the equestrian statues were often situated in front of colonnades, public squares, temples or along the triumphal streets; in places, therefore, fundamental for their centrality. Finally, the presence of the basement on which the personifications of the noble cities are carved is linked to the same archaic traditions.\n\nOn the base of the \"equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel II\" are sculptural depictions of 14 Italian noble cities, or rather the capitals of Italian states founded before the Savoy monarchy.\n\nThey aren't the statues of the most important cities in Italy, but of those that were once capitals of ancient Italian pre-unification monarchies, all of which are precedent and therefore historically converging towards the Savoy monarchy—for this reason they are considered \"mothers noble\"s of Unification of Italy.\n\nThe 14 sculptural representations of the noble cities are deliberately placed at the base of the \"equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel II\", which metaphorically symbolizes the nature of historical foundations of Italy. In a broader sense, they also represent the concept that the unity of the homeland, as a whole, rests on a basis constituted by the municipalities. Unlike those dedicated to the regions of Italy, the statues depicting the 14 cities are all the work of the same sculptor, Eugenio Maccagnani.\n\nContinuing to climb the stairway beyond the equestrian statue of Victor Emmnauel II, is the most imposing and striking architectonic element—the large portico with Corinthian-style columns, slightly curved, located on the top of the monument, and inserted between two temple propylaea called \"sommoportico\" due to its elevated position. The propylaea are the two small porticos projecting with respect to the portico which are located at its lateral ends that constitute the entrances.\n\nThe portico is long and is centrally supported by 16 tall columns surmounted by Corinthian capitals, embellished by the face of the \"Italia turrita\" (located in the centre) and acanthus leaves. The cornice above the colonnade is instead decorated with statues representing the 16 allegorical personifications of the Italian regions where each statue corresponds to a column. Giuseppe Sacconi was inspired by the Temple of Castor and Pollux located in the Roman Forum near the Vittoriano.\nEach propylaeum has a bronze statue depicting quadrigae, each one hosting a \"Winged Victory\". The architectural and expressive synergies of the triumphal arches are thus re-proposed—the allegorical meaning of the \"quadriga\", since ancient times, is in fact that of success. This concept is reinforced by the presence of the \"Winged Victories\", messengers descended from heaven by the divinities who flank the winner of a military battle as their favourite.\n\nThe two quadrigae, as the Latin inscriptions placed on the pediments of the underlying propylaea expressly declare, symbolize the freedom of the citizens (\"\", right) and the unity of the homeland (\"\", left), the two concepts pivots that inform the entire monument and are attributed to the sovereign Victor Emmmanuel II. The implicit message is that Italy, once again a single political group and gained independence, leaving behind the glories of Rome and the pomp of the papal court, is ready to spread a new Italian Renaissance articulated on the moral virtues represented allegorically in the Vittoriano.\nThe concepts \"freedom of citizens\" and \"unity of the homeland\" also summarize the fundamental themes that characterized the beginning and the end of the contribution given by Victor Emmanuel II to the Unification of Italy. Having ascended the throne for a few months, he published the proclamation of Moncalieri (20 November 1849) which confirmed the survival of the liberal regime even in the repressive period following the wave of revolutions of 1848. His political work had ended with the capture of Rome (20 September 1870), which became the capital, although the unification of Trentino-Alto Adige and Julian March (annexed only in 1919 after the First World War) were still missing. The quadrigas, already planned in the original project, were built and positioned in 1927. Inside the pediments of the two propylaea are sculptural groups that have the same theme as the respective quadrigas above.\n\nThe interior spaces of the portico and the propylaea can be accessed through two triumphal entrance stairways located at each propylaeum. The two entrance staircases are located on a small shelf that can be reached via a short staircase that joins the terrace of the redeemed cities. At the base of the entrance stairway of the propylaea are located four statues of \"Winged Victories\" on triumphal columns, made in 1911—two are at the entrance to the right propylea, and two at the entrance to the left propylea.\n\nEach entrance leads to a large quadrangular vestibule, in dialogue with the outside due to a colonnade, and from the vestibules one enters the interior spaces of the portico. These rooms are decorated with mosaics, important works of floral Liberty and pictorial symbolism, which cover the lunettes and the two domes of the propylaea. Even the mosaics have as their subject the metaphorical representation of virtues and feelings, very often rendered as allegorical personifications, which animated Italians during the unification of Italy. The interiors of the portico are decorated with the allegories of the sciences, while the doors that connect the propylaea and the portico are embellished with depictions on the arts.\n\nThe decoration of the ceiling of the left propylaeum was entrusted to Giulio Bargellini; in these mosaics he adopted innovative technical devices, such as the use of materials of various kinds and tiles of different sizes and inclined so as to create studied reflections of light, and where the lines of the mosaic representations continue towards those of the columns below. The mosaics of Bargellini, along the highest part of the walls, represent figuratively \"The Faith\", \"The Force, \"The Work\" and \"The Wisdom\". The decoration of the ceiling of the right propylaeum was instead entrusted to Antonio Rizzi. Rizzi dedicated himself, along the highest part of the vertical walls, to \"The Law\", \"The Value\", \"The Peace\", \"The Union\" and \"The Poetry\".\n\nThe internal doors leading from the two propylaea to the portico are decorated with allegorical sculptures representing \"The Architecture\" and \"The Music\", which are found in the vestibule on the left and which are the work of Antonio Garella, and \"The Painting\" and \"The Sculpture\", which are located in the vestibule on the right and which were made by Lio Gangeri. The interior of the portico has a polychrome marble floor and a coffered ceiling—the latter of which was designed by Gaetano Koch, is called the \"ceiling of the sciences\".\n\nThe ceiling owes its name to the bronze sculptures of Giuseppe Tonnini placed inside the portico, collectively known as \"The Allegories\" of \"The Sciences\". They are all made up of female personifications: \"The Geometry\", \"The Chemistry\", \"The Physics\", \"The Mineralogy\", \"The Mechanics\", \"The Astronomy\" and \"The Geography\". The vertical wall opposite the columns is decorated at the top with mosaics at gilded backgrounds, after 1925. Other sculptures present inside the portico are the trophy of arms—a vast set of shields, cuirasses, halberds, spears, flags, arrows and quivers in a trophy the crown of Italy is shown, along with the eagle with the crusader shield and the collar of the Annunciation (emblems of the House of Savoy).\n\nThe staircase leading to the terrace of the redeemed cities is the best point of observation of the statues of the Italian regions, since the latter are found on the cornice of the portico, each in correspondence of a column. The presence of metaphorically depicting statues of the Italian regions is inspired by the allegorical personifications of the Roman provinces, often placed on commemorative monuments during the imperial era. The number of statues placed on the top of the portico is equal to 16, given that at the time of the drafting of the construction project, 16 Italian regions were identified. Each statue is high and was entrusted to a different sculptor who were almost always native to the region of which he would have carved the image. The cornice is also embellished with friezes consisting of eagles and lion heads.\n\nThe crypt of the Italian Unknown Soldier is located under the \"equestrian statue of Victor Emmanuel II\" which can be accessed from the Shrine of the Flags museum, from where it is possible to see the side of the shrine of the Unknown Soldier that faces towards the interior spaces of the Vittoriano. It is therefore located at the Altar of the Fatherland, from which the side of the tomb that faces towards the outside of the building is seen instead.\n\nThe crypt of the Unknown Soldier is the work of the architect Armando Brasini. It is a room in the shape of a Greek cross with a domed vault which is accessed via two flights of stairs. A short tunnel starts from the crypt and reaches the niche of the chapel of the Unknown Soldier. The niche is inserted in an arcosolium inspired by the style of early Christian buildings, especially the catacombs. The ceiling of the crypt instead recalls the Roman architecture, alternating cross vaults and barrel vaults. The room, built using bricks, is characterized by the presence of round arches and niches. There is also a small altar for religious services.\n\nThe walls of the crypt are decorated with a mosaic of Byzantine style, by Giulio Bargellini, of a religious nature. The crucifixion of Jesus is located above the tomb of the Unknown Soldier, where, on the walls, stand the patron saints of the Italian Armed Forces: Saint Martin patron of the infantry, Saint George of the cavalry, Saint Sebastian of the local police and Saint Barbara of the Italian Navy, bomb squad and military engineers. Finally, in the dome, is the Madonna of Loreto, patron saint of the Italian Air Force.\n\nParts of the crypt and sepulcher were made with stone materials from the mountains that were the scene of battles of the First World War, with the floor made of Karst marble, and the small altar made from a single block of stone from Monte Grappa.\n\nInside the Vittoriano are some museums dedicated to the history of Italy, especially the Unification of Italy (\"Risorgimento\"): the Central Museum of the Risorgimento () with an adjoining study institute, the Flag of Italy Memorial () and an area that hosts temporary exhibitions of artistic interest, historical, sociological and cultural called \"ala Brasini\".\n\nAccess to the Central Museum of the Risorgimento is on the left side of the monument, at the back of the Santa Maria in Ara Coeli along via di San Pietro in Carcere. The period of Italian history between the end of the 18th century and the First World War is displayed by memorabilia, paintings, sculptures, documents (letters, diaries and manuscripts), drawings, engravings, weapons and prints.\nOn the entrance stairway of the Central Museum of the Risorgimento are visible engravings related to some significant episodes for the birth of the Risorgimento movement, from the seed thrown by the French Revolution to the Napoleonic Wars, in order to better frame and remember the national history included between the reform of the ancient Italian states and the end of the First World War. Along the walls, other marble engravings show some pieces of texts enunciated by prominent personalities, which better testify and describe this part of Italian history.\n\nThe Central Museum of the Risorgimento also includes the Shrine of the Flags, a museum where the war flags of dissolved military units and decommissioned ships from the Italian Army, Italian Air Force, Italian Navy, Carabinieri, \"Polizia di Stato\", Penitentiary Police and \"Guardia di Finanza\" are collected and temporarily stored. In case a unit is reformed, the flags are retrieved by the unit. Access to the shrine is located along Via dei Fori Imperiali, where memorabilia, relating mainly to the Risorgimento wars, in which the Italian Armed Forces took part, are also kept.\n\nThe \"ala Brasini\", reserved for temporary exhibitions, is dedicated to Armando Brasini, the main promoter of the Central Museum. The wing has three exhibition rooms: the \"large exhibition hall\", with a surface area of , generally hosts art exhibitions, and those that require more space, the \"central hall\" of and the \"jubilee hall\" of , are used.\n\n"}

{"id": "2285836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2285836", "title": "Gueuze", "text": "Gueuze\n\nGueuze (Dutch \"geuze\", ; French \"gueuze\", ) is a type of lambic, a Belgian beer. It is made by blending young (1-year-old) and old (2- to 3-year-old) lambics, which is bottled for a second fermentation. Because the young lambics are not fully fermented, the blended beer contains fermentable sugars, which allow a second fermentation to occur. \n\nSince gueuze is made by blending lambics, it tastes different from traditional ale and lager style beers. Because aged hops are used to produce these lambics, the beer has little to none of the traditional hop flavor and aroma that can be found in most other styles of beer. Furthermore, the wild yeasts that are specific to lambic-style beers give gueuze a dry, cider-like, musty, sour, acetic acid, lactic acid taste. Many describe the taste as sour and \"barnyard-like\". Because of its carbonation, gueuze is sometimes called \"Brussels Champagne\".\n\nIn modern times, some brewers have added sweeteners such as aspartame to their gueuzes to sweeten them, trying to make the beer more appealing to a wider audience. The original, unsweetened version is often referred to as \"Oude Gueuze\" (\"Old Gueuze\") and became more popular in the early 2000s. Tim Webb, a British writer on Belgian and other beers, comments on the correct use of the term \"'Oude gueuze' or 'oude geuze', now legally defined and referring to a drink made by blending two or more 100% lambic beer.\"\n\nTraditionally, gueuze is served in champagne bottles, which hold either or . Traditionally, gueuze, and the lambics from which it is made, has been produced in the area known as Pajottenland and in Brussels. However, some non-Pajottenland/Brussels lambic brewers have sprung up and one or two also produce gueuze -- see table below. Gueuze (both 'Oude' and others) qualified for the European Union's designation 'TSG' (Traditional Speciality Guaranteed) in 1997/98 -- see Geographical indications and traditional specialities (EU).\n\nThere is some debate on where the word gueuze originated. One theory is that it originated from \"Geysa\" (geyser), Old Norse for \"gush\", as, during times of vigorous fermentation, Gueuze will spew out of the bunghole of its enclosing oak barrel.\n\nThe most likely theory says that the name stems from the 'Geuzenstraat' (Geuzen Street) in Brussels where a lambic brewery was established. The story is that when the French under Napoleon occupied Belgium and thus Brussels, a lot of Champagne was drunk in Brussels. Champagne was something rather new in Brussels in those days and had become a real hype. This beverage came in strong glass bottles (most beer at the time was supplied in barrels). One brewer, situated in the Geuzenstraat, had the idea to collect the empty Champagne bottles and to refill them with what was called lambic beer. He added a bit of sugar for a second fermentation and re-sealed the bottles with a cork which was similar to the Champagne cork. By doing so, he hoped to benefit a bit from the Champagne hype. The new beer was a success and soon obtained the name \"from the Geuzenstraat\" or gueuze. The bigger gueuze bottles are still very similar to Champagne bottles today.\n\nSome American craft breweries have begun blending young and old sour beers, to produce their own versions of the traditional gueuze. In 2016 Jester King Brewery released a blended, spontaneously fermented beer which it labelled as \"Méthode Gueuze.\" However, \"the High Council for Artisanal Lambic Beers (HORAL)\" objected to the name, and the two parties arranged a meeting in Belgium. It was agreed that in future the American brewers would use the designation \"Méthode Traditionelle\" as a style name.\n\nCommercial production of gueuze commenced in the 19th century; modern breweries that produce gueuze include: \n\nBoth gueuze and lambic are protected under Belgian (since 1965) and European (since 1992) law.\n\nInformation extracted from Webb\n\n\n\n\n"}

SIMMs used were the 4 MB MS44L-AA and the 32 MB MS44-DA, which both had parity. It was the first VAX system to use the TURBOchannel interconnect. The upgrade path was to the VAXstation 4000 Model 96.\n\nThe VAXstation 4000 Model 90, code named \"\"Cougar\"\", was a further development of the VAXstation 4000 Model 60. Development of the VAXstation 4000 Model 90 began in mid-1991.\n\nThe workstation used the KA49-A CPU module containing a NVAX microprocessor operating at 74.43 MHz (14 ns cycle time) with a 256 KB external secondary cache. The NVAX had a 64-bit data bus to the NMC (NVAX Memory Controller) two gate array.

{"id": "2285847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2285847", "title": "Carte orange", "text": "Carte orange\n\nThe carte orange (Orange Card) was a pass for the public transportation system in Paris and the surrounding Île-de-France region. A holder of the pass was entitled to unlimited use of the public transit system within a given period of time, with \"Cartes oranges\" being available for durations of one week or one month. The carte orange was discontinued in February 2009, and replaced by Navigo semaine (one-week pass) and Navigo mois (one-month pass) on a Navigo card.\n\nThe Île-de-France region, with regards to public transportation, is divided in six concentric zones, the first one being the city of Paris. The most basic pass for Paris and its close banlieue covers zones 1–2, costing €17.20 for a one-week pass and €56.60 for a one-month pass.\n\nThe Carte Orange itself is composed of a subway pass and an identity card, both of which are stored in a small, transparent, flexible plastic folder.\n\nThe subway pass — a small, rectangular ticket composed mainly of stiff paper — lists the period of time and the zones for which it is valid, as well as its price. At the top of the front side of the ticket, there is a thin, holographic strip, to prevent counterfeiting. On the reverse side, there is a brown, magnetic strip on which the card's data (zones and dates) are stored. The user feeds the Carte orange ticket into a turnstile upon entering a metro station, and the machine, after reading the ticket, returns it to the user. A weekly Carte Orange is valid only for one seven-day period, always starting on Monday and ending on Sunday.\n\nThe identity card is an attempt on the part of the public transit authorities to link each Carte Orange to one person, preventing multiple people from sharing one Carte Orange. The identity card features a space in which the user must print his or her full name and, in the lower left-hand corner, a space to which the user must affix a small, colour photograph of him or herself. On the back of the card, the user is required to fill out his or her full address. You must present a passport-size photo when purchasing the Carte Orange, and the ticket office worker affixes the photo to the ID card. Photo booths are often located near ticket offices.\n\nAs an additional security measure, many Paris Métro turnstiles will not accept the same Carte orange ticket more than once in a short lapse of time. In the event that one accidentally exits a station prematurely (by following the wrong signs, for instance), it may be necessary to wait (usually only a few minutes) before re-using the ticket. The intention of this mechanism is to prevent multiple passengers from using a single Carte orange to enter an unmonitored metro entrance. \n\nWhen using the bus or tramway, the user does not validate his or her ticket electronically; rather, he or she shows the driver the identity card and the ticket, who then determines whether or not the Carte Orange is valid for the route.\n\nIt is not possible to travel with a Carte Orange beyond the zones that the card is valid, and the transportation authority requires the travelers to purchase a ticket valid for the entire trip, regardless of the zones already covered by the carte orange. While some stations have special ticket windows that sell extensions for arriving passengers who need them (notably for tourists the Versailles station in Zone 4), others do not. This sometimes results in a traveller being stuck in the station until they can attract the attention of a metro employee, or jump the turnstile. The Charles de Gaulle Airport RER stop (located in Zone 5) is, unfortunately for tourists, one of those stations that does not have an accessible ticket window on the incoming side.\n\nThe Carte orange has several features intended to make fraud more difficult; the date of each carte's validity is printed in large characters, in 1997 the holographic strip was added, and a new kind of ink was introduced. Before the introduction of these new security features, it was estimated that 2.5% of all Cartes oranges were counterfeit.\n\nThe Carte orange was launched in 1975, at a time when fare collection for public transit in Paris and the surrounding region was very complicated — in fact, someone wanting to traverse Paris at the time might have had to buy five separate tickets. There had been several attempts to simplify ticketing in the Parisian public transport system in the past. Notably in 1968 a ticket valid for use in the bus and metro, the \"Ticket ivoire commun\" (common ivory ticket) was introduced and three years later a ticket valid in the SNCF, buses, metro and \"cars de banlieue\" was launched. Nevertheless, the Carte orange was novel in that it was the first ticket that gave the passenger unlimited access to all of the region's public transports for a flat rate, and during a specific period of time. a one-use ticket can be used in any form of the Paris public transit system.\n\nInitially, the Carte orange was only available to workers, who had to supply proof of employment in order to purchase it. This restriction was soon removed, however, and the Carte became very popular: while transit authorities had estimated that 650,000 Cartes oranges would be sold, within 6 months of its introduction 900,000 were in use. According to Michel Margairaz, a historian of Parisian transports, the gap between these figures can be explained due to a problem in the transit authorities' methodology — they assumed that only those public transit users who would save money with the Carte orange would buy one, but this was not to be the case. Many people were attracted to the idea of using Parisian public transports without worrying about tickets or fares, even if it proved to be more expensive.\n\nPublic transit revenues, not only passenger convenience, were central concerns for the Carte's architects: according to Paul Josse, an official involved in the creation of the Carte orange, the new pass \"couldn't cost the state or municipal governments a sou.\" Furthermore, the RATP and the SNCF, respectively responsible for Île de France and national public transit, had to work out a revenue-sharing scheme, but this proved to be relatively easy.\n\nThe Carte orange was also intended to boost the use of public transit, then in rapid decline, due to increasing use of cars. In fact, at the end of the 1960s, the transport ministry was actually considering abolishing bus service in Paris. However, within a year of the Carte's introduction, bus usage went up 40%, and more generally, it has been estimated that during the first ten years of its existence, the Carte led to an increase of 20% in the use of Parisian public transport.\n\nFinally, the Carte was intended to make fares more equitable; before the Carte's introduction, those who lived further from the city centre paid much more than more centrally located residents. While it seemed reasonable that those who wanted to travel further should pay more, many people who lived far from downtown Paris had to make many more connections as they travelled compared to others who travelled no further, connections for which they had to pay. The flat-rate system introduced by the Carte changed this.\n\nThe Carte orange has been phased out and replaced by the Navigo card. This new card contains a chip and is scanned at turnstiles, carries a photo of the user on the card itself, and may be linked to an account that the user has with the RATP. Thus, unlike the Carte orange, when a Navigo card is lost or stolen, it may be replaced (for a fee). The Carte orange was officially replaced by the Navigo card on May 20, 2008.\n\nThe consequence of the phase out of the Carte orange is that it is more expensive for short-term visitors and tourists to take advantage of the maximum discounts available from advance bulk purchase of trips. This is because the Navigo card must either be linked to a French account (available to residents only) or purchased for a €5 fee (\"Carte Navigo Découverte\").\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2285865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2285865", "title": "Norm O'Neill", "text": "Norm O'Neill\n\nNorman Clifford Louis O'Neill (19 February 1937 – 3 March 2008) was a cricketer who played for New South Wales and Australia. A right-handed batsman known for his back foot strokeplay, O'Neill made his state debut aged 18, before progressing to Test selection aged 21 in late 1958. Early in his career, O'Neill was one of the foremost batsmen in the Australian team, scoring three Test centuries and topping the run scoring aggregates on a 1959–60 tour of the Indian subcontinent which helped Australia win its last Test and series on Pakistani soil for 39 years, as well as another series in India. His career peaked in 1960–61 when he scored 181 in the Tied Test against the West Indies, and at the end of the series, had a career average of 58.25. \n\nO'Neill's performances on the 1961 tour of England saw him named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. Thereafter his form was less formidable, characterised by nervousness and fidgeting at the start of his innings. Persistent knee problems as well as a controversial media attack on the legality of West Indian bowler Charlie Griffith saw him dropped from the Australian team after 1965. O'Neill also bowled occasional leg spin and was regarded as one of the finest fielders of his era. He later became a cricket commentator and his son Mark O'Neill also played cricket at state level.\n\nHe was inducted into the Australian Hall of Fame by the CA in 2018.\n\nThe son of a builder, O'Neill was born in Carlton, New South Wales. He had no cricketing associations on his father's side of the family, but his maternal uncle, Ron Campion, played for the Glebe club in Sydney Grade Cricket. Campion trained for cricket near the O'Neill family home, at Bexley Oval. O'Neill accompanied his uncle to cricket from the age of seven and was given batting practice at the end of each session. At Bexley Primary school, O'Neill was denied a chance to play cricket as the school did not field a team. Moving on to Kogarah Intermediate High School, O'Neill played cricket in defiance of a teacher who recommended that he take up athletics. As a teenager, O'Neill idolised Keith Miller after his uncle took him to the Sydney Cricket Ground: O'Neill saw Miller play that day and was impressed with the way he hit the ball off the back foot.\n\nUnder his uncle's guidance, O'Neill joined the St George Cricket Club, in the Sydney Grade competition. He steadily moved up through the grades and broke into the first grade side at the age of 16. Sensing his potential, the club's selectors informed him that regardless of form, he would play the full season, which allowed him to be uninhibited in his batting. He made 108 in seven innings. The next season, he was out 12 times leg before wicket in 15 innings, and run out in the other three. O'Neill attributed his failures to over-aggressiveness and resolved to improve his patience. In the second match of the new season, the 17-year-old O'Neill made his first century. With all five state selectors onlooking, he made 28 in the next match and was called into the state squad.\n\nO'Neill made his debut for New South Wales at the age of 18 against South Australia during the 1955–56 season. His lack of contribution was highlighted against the backdrop of his team's crushing innings victory: O'Neill failed to score a run or take a wicket. New South Wales bowled first and had South Australia at 6/49 when Miller introduced O'Neill's occasional leg spin, presumably to ease the debutant's nerves by bringing him into the game. The home team struck 18 from three overs. O'Neill was listed to bat in the lower middle order but after the top order had made a big start, Miller brought O'Neill up. He came in against the second new ball and was clean bowled. O'Neill was dropped and did not play another match for the season, but had gained invaluable experience.\n\nO'Neill steadily rose in the 1956–57 season. At the start of the season, with many players still on international duty during the closing stages of the tour to England and the subsequent stopover in the Indian subcontinent, O'Neill was recalled and made 60 and 63 not out against Queensland at the start of the season. This saw him retain his place when the Test players returned. After making a pair of single-figures scored, he made a sequence of three 60s against South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia, He was rewarded with selection in the one-off match between Ray Lindwall's XI and Neil Harvey's XI, which doubled as a national selection trial, before making his first ton (127) against South Australia. He ended the season with 567 runs at 43.61, and earned selection for a non-Test tour of New Zealand under Ian Craig, in a team composed mainly of young players. He made 102 not out in the only \"Test\" match that he played, helping to set up a ten-wicket win. heading the tour averages with 218 runs at 72.66. Despite this, he was overlooked for the 1957–58 Test tour of South Africa. It was regarded as one of the most controversial decisions of the decade.\n\nO'Neill responded during the 1957–58 Sheffield Shield season weakened by the absence of the Test players, aggregating 1,005 runs at 83.75 and taking 26 wickets at 20.42 with his leg spinners, thus topping the national bowling and batting averages. Prior to the season, he had never taken a first-class wicket. In the opening match of the summer, he took 3/74 against Queensland. He then took a total of 5/51 scored 33 and 48 not out in a six-wicket win over Western Australia before taking 3/52 and adding two fifties in the return match. He then broke through for his first century of the season, scoring 114 and taking 3/44 in a ten-wicket win over South Australia. However, he reached more productive levels in the second half of the season.\n\nThis comprised 175 against Victoria, 74 and 48 against Queensland, 125 and 23* against South Australia and 233 against Victoria. His 233 was made in little over four hours and featured 38 fours. It was the first time that a New South Welshman (let alone a twenty-year-old) had scored 1,000 in a Shield season. Bradman and Bill Ponsford were the only others before him. He added 12 wickets in the final four matches, including 2/50 and 4/40 in the match against Queensland. O'Neill's performances played a large part in his state's fifth consecutive title.\n\nThese performances led former Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly to compare him to Bradman and former Test opening batsman Jack Fingleton to lament his non-selection for the South African tour and its reflection on the plight of Australian cricket.\n\nAt the time, his employers refused to make allowances for him to play sport, forcing him to begin work at six in the morning. As a result, he considered moving to South Australia, where a grocery magnate offered him employment and financial incentives. However, he stayed after state officials intervened, with Sir Ronald Irish, the Australian chairman of Rothmans, providing him with a job in Sydney. At the time, O'Neill had another offer. Having represented his state in baseball and been nominated in the All-Australian team in 1957, he was approached by the New York Yankees, having had experience at a pitcher and short stop. O'Neill was offered a fee more than 25 times that for a single Test match, as well as travel costs and accommodation, to trial with the Yankees. He agreed, but Irish dissuaded him less than a week before his scheduled departure.\n\nIdentified as a future Test prospect, he was selected in a Western Australia Combined XI for a match against the touring England cricket team at the start of the 1958–59 season in Perth. Prior to the match, O'Neill was hounded by the media. The tourists decided to test him with short-pitched bowling, especially Fred Trueman. O'Neill decided to abstain from hooking, while attacking the spin of Jim Laker with a series of sweep shots. After four and a half hours of uncharacteristic restraint, he compiled 104 with an emphasis on off side play. He took a total of 2/67, removing Fred Trueman and Arthur Milton.\n\nHe scored 85 against Western Australia and then made 84 not out for New South Wales against England. He was selected for an Australian XI, which played the tourists in a dress rehearsal before the Tests. He made one and two as Australia were crushed by 345 runs.\n\nNevertheless, O'Neill was selected to make his debut in the five-Test series against England, playing in all of the matches. The First Test in Brisbane was a low scoring match described by Australian captain Richie Benaud as producing \"some of the slowest and worst cricket imaginable\", O'Neill made 34 in Australia's first innings of 186 to help secure a lead of 52. He then top-scored with an unbeaten 71 in the second innings, guiding Australia to an eight-wicket victory. O'Neill scored 71 of the last 89 runs scored while he was at the crease, refusing to be dried up by the England's usage of leg theory. It enlivened a match plagued by time-wasting, and best remembered for a depressingly slow innings by England's Trevor Bailey, who scored 68 from 426 balls in seven and a half hours. England captain Peter May described O'Neill's innings as \"sparkling\" and said that it made \"everything which had gone before look even more wretched\". Retired English player Ian Peebles, writing in the \"Sunday Times\", said \"Although O'Neill is in the very early stages of his career, it is already something of an occasion when he comes to the wicket, and one can sense the expectancy of the crowd and the heightened tension of the opposition\". Wisden opined that O'Neill had \"saved a game that had been tortuous for days\". For his part, O'Neill said that the dour play was \"unbelievable\" and that he was \"just about falling to sleep\" in the field.\n\nHe struck 77 in the rain-affected drawn Third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground and followed this with 56 in the Fourth Test in Adelaide. Despite making a duck in the Fifth Test, he ended the series as the second highest runscorer with 282 at 56.40 as Australia took the series 4–0. He bowled two overs without success. Outside the Tests, O'Neill scored 155 and 128 against Victoria and Western Australia respectively as New South Wales completed their sixth successive Sheffield Shield win.\n\nThe following season O'Neill was Australia's leading batsman during the 1959–60 tour to Pakistan and India, where he was a part of the last Australian team to win a Test on Pakistani soil for 39 years. After a quiet match in the First Test eight-wicket win in Dacca in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), in which he scored two and 26 not out, O'Neill played a key role in the victory in the Second Test in Lahore that was to Australia's last in Pakistan until 1998. O'Neill made his maiden Test century of 134 in the first innings to give Australia a 245-run lead. He then took his maiden Test wicket in Pakistan's second innings, that of Shujauddin. This left Australia chasing a target of 122 in the last two hours on the final day. The chase was on schedule with O'Neill partnering Neil Harvey when the Pakistanis began wasting time to prevent an Australian victory. This was implemented by swapping fielders very slowly when the left and rightt-handed combination of Harvey and O'Neill took a single, and overs began taking seven minutes instead of three. To counter this, Harvey deliberately backed away when a ball was aimed at the stumps and threw away his wicket by letting himself be bowled for 37. This allowed Benaud to come in and bat with O'Neill so that the two rightt-handed batsmen would give no opportunity to waste time by switching the field. Benaud then threatened Pakistani captain Imtiaz Ahmed with a formal complaint over the time-wasting, and proceesings returned to their normal pace. Australia made the target with a few minutes to spare, with O'Neill on 43. O'Neill failed to make double figures in the final Test, which was drawn, but ended the series with 218 runs at 72.66. In another tour match, against the President's XI, O'Neill scored an unbeaten 52 in a low-scoring match as Australia stumbled to their target of 116 with only three wickets in hand.\n\nO'Neill's performances in Pakistan was such that the parents in one cricket-following Karachi family named their new son Anil for its resemblance to O'Neill. Anil Dalpat went on to become the first Hindu to represent Pakistan, playing nine Tests in the 1980s as a wicketkeeper.\n\nOn the five-Test Indian series which followed, O'Neill started slowly, aggregating 60 runs in the first two Tests, which were shared 1–1. He returned to form with a leg-side dominated 163 in a high-scoring draw in the Third Test at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay. After scoring 40 in an innings victory in the Fourth Test in Madras, Australia needed a draw in the Fifth Test in Calcutta with four players injured or ill, while Benaud had a dislocated spinning finger. O'Neill scored 113 in the first innings to help a depleted team take a 137-run first innings lead and prevent India from squaring the series. He was Australia's leading scorer in the Tests, with 376 runs at 62.66. He also made his highest first-class score of 284, against an Indian President's XI in Ahmedabad. He was the top scorer for the whole subcontinental Test tour, with 594 runs in eight matches at 66.00.\n\nHe returned to Australia and played in one match for New South Wales at the end of the 1959–60 season, scoring 175 as his state defeated Western Australia and won a seventh Shield in a row. Prior to the following Australian summer, O'Neill was part of an International Cavaliers team that toured South Africa. He scored 133 runs at 21.83.\n\nIn the lead-up to the 1960–61 home Tests series against the West Indies, O'Neill scored 156 not to set up an innings win for his state over the tourists. He then struck 181 in the first innings of the opening match at Brisbane, his highest Test score. The innings prompted teammate Bob Simpson to say \"if God gave me an hour to watch someone I'd seen, I'd request to see Norman O'Neill. He had the style.\" Australia took a first innings lead and O'Neill made 26 in the second innings as Australia collapsed towards a likely defeat before recovering; the match ended in the first Tied Test in history. This was the peak of O'Neill's career. Having played 14 Tests, he was averaging 67.68 with the bat.\n\nHe then struck 114 as his state defeated the tourists by an innings, and he made 40 and a duck as the Australians took the series lead in the Second Test. He made 70 and 71 in the Third Test loss in Sydney, one of the few players able to combat Lance Gibbs effectively, top-scoring in the first innings and second top-scoring in the second innings. He then made 65 in the second innings in the Fourth Test at Adelaide, where Australia held on by one wicket for a draw. He contributed 48 in the second innings of the Fifth Test as Australia appeared headed for a series victory. However, a late collapse ensued, and Australia scraped home by two wickets to take the series 2–1. O'Neill ended the series with 522 runs at 52.20. O'Neill gained attention during the summer for frequently losing his wicket by impulsively sweeping. This was attributed to the dominance of his bottom hand, which saw his bat swinging across the line of flight of the ball. Despite the criticism, he was at the peak of his international career, having made 1398 runs at 58.35 in his first 18 Tests.\n\nO'Neill was selected for the tour of England in 1961, and he warmed up by scoring centuries in consecutive matches against Tasmania for the Australian squad. During the English summer, O'Neill scored 1981 runs at 60.03, narrowly missing becoming only the fourth post-war player after Don Bradman, Neil Harvey and Bill Lawry to make 2,000 runs in an Ashes tour.\n\nIn the third match against Yorkshire, which was O'Neill's second for the tour, he scored an unbeaten 100 marked by his cover driving. He followed this with a 74 against Lancashire before a 124 two matches later against Glamorgan, which was described by Wisden as the best of the season. He scored 73 against Gloucestershire and made 122 on his first appearance at Lord's, against the Marylebone Cricket Club, in what was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests. Australia went on to win by 63 runs. In the next match against Sussex, O'Neill was carried from the ground after suffering a knee injury, and after failing to bat in either innings, it appeared he would be sidelined for a substantial period.\n\nHowever, he recovered to be selected for the First Test at Edgbaston, just five days later. He made 82 as Australia scored 9/516 declared and took a 321-run first innings lead, but England could not be dismissed in the second innings and salvaged a draw. He continued his form with an unbeaten 104 against Kent between the Tests.\n\nThe \"Battle of the Ridge\" in the Second Test at Lord's—the home of cricket—was an unhappy one for O'Neill. On an erratic pitch with a visible ridge that caused uneven bounce, O'Neill made one and a duck as an Australia scraped home by five wickets in a low-scoring match.\n\nHe returned to the county matches and scored 162 against Lancashire, before scoring 27 and 19 as England squared the series in the Third Test at Headingley. O'Neill then scored 142 against Northamptonshire, but the hosts were able to tie the scores when stumps were drawn with four wickets in hand.\n\nAfter rectifying a technical fault, O'Neill made 67 in the second innings of the Fourth Test at Old Trafford with the series tied at 1–1, helping Australia take a narrow victory to retain the Ashes. Heading into the final Test, O'Neill had a consistent run, scoring three fifties in four innings. He made his first century against England in the Fifth Test at The Oval with 117 as Australia drew the match to take the series. He did so after being given a \"lucky coin\" by a spectator and being dropped at second slip when he was on 19. He scored 324 runs at 40.50 in the Tests and was subsequently named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 1962. Following the Tests, O'Neill added four half-centuries in five innings in a consistent run towards the close of the tour. He left English soil with 138 against Minor Counties, in a non-first-class match. In all first-class matches, he made seven centuries, and his run aggregate was second only to Lawry, who made 2,019 runs.\n\nAfter this tour, his form began to decline, as he became prone to uncertain and fidgety starts to his innings, which earned him the nickname \"Nervous Norm\". A persistent knee injury increasingly troubled him and was to end his career. The 1961–62 Australian team was purely domestic with no touring Test team, and New South Wales completed their ninth Sheffield Shield title in a row, O'Neill had a poor season, scoring only 377 runs at 25.13, passing fifty only twice.\n\nThe 1962–63 home Ashes series was Australia's first Test matches in 18 months. After an unproductive season last year, O'Neill started the new summer with 15 and 2/30 for a Western Australia Combined XI against Ted Dexter's Englishmen. His victims with the ball were Dexter and batsman Tom Graveney. He then made his first century in over a year, scoring 131 against Western Australia for his state. O'Neill completed his preparation for the Tests by helping New South Wales to defeat Dexter's men by an innings. He scored 143 and took 2/36, removing Graveney and leading batsman Colin Cowdrey.\n\nO'Neill made 56 in the First Test drawn at Brisbane but failed to pass 20 in the next two matches, which were shared by the two teams. After his wife made him a pair of \"lucky lemon socks\", he scored 100 in the first innings of the drawn Fourth Test in Adelaide, which turned out to be his last Test century with fifteen Tests before the end of his career. With Alan Davidson injured during the match, O'Neill was required to bowl substantially, conceding 49 runs in what was his most expensive performance to date. He scored 73 in the Fifth Test in Sydney to finish the series with 310 runs at 34.44, substantially below his career average of 53.8 prior to the series. He also took two wickets, one in each of the Third and Fifth Tests, removing Fred Titmus and Dexter respectively. Outside the Tests, O'Neill struggled and passed 25 once in eight other non-Test innings. This was a 93 against arch-rivals Victoria, which was not enough to prevent defeat. Victoria went on to win the Sheffield Shield and end New South Wales' nine-year winning streak.\n\nAt the end of the season, he embarked on a tour with the International Cavaliers, which toured Africa, mostly playing against provincial teams. He played in seven matches and had a productive series, scoring 541 runs at 41.54 including a century and four fifties. He also bowled more frequently than usual taking seven wickets at 53.29.\n\nThe following season in 1963–64, O'Neill started poorly, passing 12 only once in his first six innings. However, he was retained for the team for the First Test against South Africa in Brisbane, where he scored 82 and 19 not out in a drawn match. He continued his resurgence with 36 and 61 not out the following fixture against Victoria, but was injured during the second innings and forced to retire hurt. This meant that he missed the Second Test, which Australia won by eight wickets. O'Neill returned and scored half centuries in each of the next two Tests. He also took two wickets to end the series with 285 runs at 40.71 and three wickets at 32.33. He added a further two half-centuries in the remaining Shield matches.\n\nO'Neill retained his place for the 1964 tour to England, and scored a century against Western Australia for the touring squad before departing for the northern hemisphere. After failing to pass 16 in his first two outings, he struck form against Glamorgan, scoring 65 and an unbeaten 109. He then added 151 and 17 not out, leading the way as the Australians defeated the MCC by nine wickets in a dress rehearsal for the Tests. However, O'Neill scored 98 in the first four innings of the opening two Tests and was forced out of the Third Test with a knee injury, the only non-draw of the series, which Australia won. Nevertheless, he passed 50 in each of the four tour matches during this period, including a 134 against Yorkshire and 90 against Northamptonshire.\n\nO'Neill returned for the final two Tests and ended the series with only 156 runs at 31.20 in five Tests without passing fifty and going wicketless. He added another century against Kent and two further fifties in the closing stages of the English summer.\n\nHis 1964–65 tour of the subcontinent on the way back to Australia was even worse, a far cry from his leading role in the previous tour to the subcontinent. After making 40 and 0 in the First Test win in Madras, he was unable to bat either innings in the Second Test in Bombay after being hospitalised due to persistent vomiting, injury as Australia ceded their series lead. He missed the remainder of the series, the Third Test in Calcutta and a one-off Test in Pakistan. Upon his return home, he has a shortened domestic season before Australia left for the West Indies. In five domestic matches, he scored 357 runs at 59.50, including a 133 not against South Australia.\n\nO'Neill started the 1964–65 tour of the West Indies strongly, scoring a century in the first match against Jamaica. He was often injured during the tour, but was at his most productive with the bat since the last series against the Caribbean team four years earlier. He made many starts, passing 20 in six of his seven Test innings, but was unable to convert them into big scores. In the First Test, O'Neill was struck on the hand by Wes Hall and was sent to hospital for X-rays after a break was suspected. During the Second Test, it was the turn of Charlie Griffith to send O'Neill to hospital, after hitting him on the forearm and causing a large bruise. His 51 and 74* in the Fourth Test at Bridgetown, Barbados, the last Test of his career, was the only time he passed 50 for the series. He ended with 266 runs at 44.33, missing the Fifth Test due to a broken hand. He managed a healthy return with the ball, taking nine of his 17 Test wickets in the series with an average of 25.55. This included his Test best of 4/41 with his leg-spinin the Second Test in Port of Spain, Trinidad. In this match, he cleaned up the hosts' tail in the first innings, removing Jackie Hendriks, Wes Hall, Charlie Griffith and Lance Gibbs.\n\nAt the end of the tour, O'Neill garnered controversy by writing outspoken newspaper columns accusing opposition pace spearhead Charlie Griffith of chucking. He was one of several Australians who took exception to Griffith's bowling action, and he put his name to a series of feature articles in Sydney's \"Daily Mirror\". These labelled Griffith as \"an obvious chucker\", saying the hosts had been \"wrong to play\" him. O'Neill stated that \"If he is allowed to continue throwing, he could kill someone\". O'Neill also expressed his desire to not have to face bowling that he deemed to be illegal. When the \"Daily Mirror\" syndicated the columns, London's \"Daily Mail\" ignored an embargo and printed the pieces while the Australians were on their homeward flight, putting O'Neill in breach of his tour contract, which forbade players from commenting in the media during tours.\n\nThe West Indies lodged an official complaint with Australia, and the Australian Cricket Board replied that it deplored the published comments, although noting that as O'Neill's touring contract had expired at the end of the tour, the point was moot. Nevertheless, the ACB changed its stance on players' writing, so that they could no longer comment on a tour until three months after its conclusion. The event is often perceived to have been a factor in O'Neill's eventual departure from the national scene.\n\nOutside the Tests, O'Neill performed strongly in three matches against regional teams, scoring centuries in each of them. He scored 125, 125, and 101 in his only three innings, against Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados.\n\nThe following season, O'Neill was overlooked for selection in all five Tests against the touring England team. Returning to New South Wales, he scored 473 runs at 39.42, including two centuries.\n\nO'Neill was omitted from the squad that toured South Africa in 1966–67, ending his Test career. He continued his Shield career while his former teammates were on the other side of the Indian Ocean, compiling 741 runs at 74.10 in a strong season. He started the season with 117 against Western Australia, before scoring a pair of 78s in the return match, helping his team to a tense 13-run win. He then scored 128 and 22 not out against Victoria and finished his season with 160 and 80 against South Australia, scoring a majority of his team's first innings score.\n\nAs a result, he was selected for an Australian Second XI to tour New Zealand. He scored 69 runs at 17.25 in two international matches and made his last first-class century, scoring 101 and 58 not out against Auckland.\n\nO'Neill retired upon his return to Australia due to a knee injury. He left a reputation as a highly entertaining batsman who did not manage to fulfil his early promise. \"A disappointment he was, perhaps, but his cricket will be recalled when those of lesser gifts are forgotten\", opined the writer EW Swanton.\n\nIn 61 matches for New South Wales, he scored 5419 runs at 52.61. He compiled 3879 runs at 61.57 for St George in grade competition before transferring to Sutherland in the 1965–66 club. He scored 168 on his new club's first day in the competition.\n\nA cigarette salesman by trade, he became a commentator in retirement. He married Gwen Wallace, a track and field athlete who won relay gold for Australia at the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. They had two sons and a daughter. Their eldest child Mark O'Neill represented New South Wales and Western Australia in the 1980s. O'Neill also co-owned a racehorse with Richie Benaud, Barry Jarman and Ray Steele, named Pall Mallan, and it won a race in 1961.\n\nO'Neill died at the age of 71 after a long battle with throat cancer.\n\nStanding six feet tall, O'Neill was compared to Don Bradman upon his entry into Test cricket. At his best, he was a dynamic stroke maker who was a crowd favourite because of his ability to score at a high pace, in particular with his power off the back foot. He was noted for his nimble footwork, which he used to negate spin bowling; however this slowed in his later career as he put on weight. O'Neill particularly liked to sweep the slower bowlers. He often put too much emphasis on his right hand, allowing a large space between his hands on the bat handle, and then turning his right shoulder too square towards the bowler. The renowned English batsman and captain Wally Hammond said that O'Neill was the best all-round batsman he had seen since World War II. O'Neill's tall build, strength and good looks also drew comparison to his boyhood idol Keith Miller. Despite the comparisons to Bradman, O'Neill was much taller and broader, and was often impetuous whereas Bradman was known for his patience and lack of rashness. O'Neill was also criticised for hitting across the line early in his innings.\n\nO'Neill was highly regarded for his style and entertainment values. Teammate Alan Davidson said \"once set he was the most exhilarating player you'd ever want to see—he was dynamite. He'd play attacking shots off balls other people would only think of defending. He had wonderful skill and technique. His shots off the back foot down the ground off fast bowlers—you can't really describe how good they were.\" His captain for Australia and New South Wales, Richie Benaud said that he was \"one of the greatest entertainers we've had in Australian cricket\". O'Neill's style led the British writer EW Swanton to say \"the art of batting, he reminded us, was not dead, merely inexplicably dormant\" Wisden opined that \"A high innings by O'Neill is a thing of masterful beauty. His stroking is delectable, immense in its power.\"\n\nLater in his career, O'Neill became a nervous and superstitious batsman, particular at the start of an innings. He wrote \"batting is a lonely business\" in his 1964 autobiography \"Ins and Outs\", opining that he sometimes found first-class cricket to be \"depressing and lonely\".\n\nHe was regarded as an excellent fieldsman at cover, with a powerful and accurate throw, described by Wisden as a \"dream throw\" honed from a junior career as a baseballer. He was named as utility player in the 1957 All Australian baseball team, and his ability was such that he was approached by Major League Baseball scouts.

He was a son of Ewan Christian, a deemster. In Manx, ' literally translates to \"Brown William\"—a name he received due to his dark hair, and in English he was called Brown-haired William.\n\nIn 1648 the Lord of Mann, James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby, appointed Christian as Receiver General. In 1651 the Earl went to England to fight for Charles II and Christian was left in command of the island militia. The Earl was taken prisoner at the Battle of Worcester, and his wife Charlotte de la Tremouille, who was residing on the Island, sought to obtain her husband's release by negotiating with the victorious parliamentarians for the surrender of the island.\n\nAt once a revolt headed by Christian broke out, the Manx Rebellion of 1651, partly as a consequence of this step and partly due to discontent caused by some agrarian arrangements recently introduced by the Earl. The rebels seized many of the island forts and then Christian entered into negotiations with the parliamentarians. The island was soon in the power of Colonel Robert Duckenfield, who had brought the parliamentary fleet to Mann in October 1651. The Countess of Derby was compelled to surrender her two fortresses, Castle Rushen and Peel Castle, and Christian remained Receiver General. He then became Governor of the Isle of Man in 1656.\n\nTwo years later, however, Christian was accused of misappropriating money, although these charges were never substantiated. He fled to England, and in 1660 was arrested in London. After serving a year of imprisonment he returned to Mann, hoping that his offence against the Earl of Derby would be condoned under the Act of Indemnity of 1661; but, anxious to punish his conduct, Charles, the new Earl, ordered his seizure. At his trial, Christian refused to plead, and the House of Keys declared that his life and property were at the mercy of the Lord of Mann. The Deemsters then passed sentence, and Christian was executed by shooting at Hango Hill (near what is now Janet's Corner, Castletown), on 2 January 1663 on charges of high treason. The execution was botched and he died of his injuries.\n\nThis arbitrary act angered King Charles II and his advisers. The deemsters and others were punished, and some reparation was made to Christian's family. Christian is chiefly celebrated through the Manx ballad \"\", which has been translated into English by John Crellin in 1774 (and separately by George Borrow), and through the references to him in Sir Walter Scott's \"Peveril of the Peak\".\n\nAn annual commemoration is held by Mec Vannin and the Manx branch of the Celtic League at the spot of his execution.\n\nDhone is a controversial figure in Manx history, some view him as a traitor, while others view him as a patriotic martyr who stood up for rights of the Manx people.\n\nThe headquarters of the Office of Human Resources of the Isle of Man government is known as 'Illiam Dhone House' for now.\n\nIn January 2006 a monument created by Bryan Kneale dedicated to Dhone was erected at Malew Church where Dhone is buried.\n\n"}

Notable for its fast pace and high levels of gore, \"Messiah\" was a commercial and critical success, reaching both \"The New York Times\" and the official UK bestseller lists. It was subsequently adapted for television by the BBC, with Starling taking a cameo role as a murder victim's corpse.\n\nThere have been four television sequels broadcast. \"Messiah I-IV\" starred Ken Stott in the lead role as DCI Redfern Metcalfe. For \"Messiah V\", Marc Warren took over as DCI Joseph Walker, heading up an entirely new cast. \"Messiah V\" was broadcast on BBC1 in January 2008. Starling is listed as series creator of the franchise.\n\nHis second book, also a \"New York Times\" bestseller, and winner of the W. H. Smith 'Thumping Good Read' Award, was \"Storm\". Set in Aberdeen, \"Storm\" begins with a ferry disaster, and follows the subsequent week in the life of Kate Beauchamp, one of the detectives from \"Messiah\", as she tries to find a serial killer while her estranged father heads up the investigation into the ferry sinking.\n\nStarling changed tack substantially with his third novel. \"Vodka\" is a sprawling, epic story of Russia immediately after the end of the Soviet Union, and runs several storylines in tandem: the efforts of an American banker, Alice Liddell, to effect the first privatisation in Russian history; the battle between Slav and Chechen gangs for control of Moscow's vodka market; and the hunt for a serial killer who is killing children and draining their blood.\n\nAnother shift in period and location came with the publication of Starling's fourth novel, \"Visibility\". \"Visibility\" is set in the winter of 1952, when the Great Smog (sometime called the Great Fog) has rolled into London, shutting down most transportation routes and sickening the populace with its noxious haze. Assigned to investigate a suspicious drowning, detective Herbert Smith discovers that the victim, a young biochemist and son of a highly placed government official, had in the hours before his death claimed to be in possession of a discovery that could change the world. \"Visibility\" gained good reviews. \"The Guardian\"'s Maxim Jakubowski called it \"mystery at its best\", while in the \"New Statesman\" Adam LeBor said: \"\"Visibility\" is an intelligent and thought-provoking book, one that asks lingering questions about the very nature of loyalty and love.\"\n\nStarling has also written a series of thrillers featuring Franco Patrese, a Pittsburgh homicide detective who later joins the FBI. The first book was published in the UK as 'Soul Murder' and in the US as 'Thou Shalt Kill.' The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review said that the book 'captures the essentials of Pittsburgh better than most natives could... This is a well-imagined thriller, a nice addition to the crowded police-procedural genre, with vivid characters and nimble-but-fitting plot twists.'\n\nThe sequel, released as 'City Of Sins' in the UK in October 2011 and as 'City Of The Dead' in the US in April 2012, is set in New Orleans around the time of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nA third novel, 'White Death', was released in December 2012.\n\nStarling has also written:\n\n\nStarling is the great-grandson of the English physiologist Ernest Starling. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating from Cambridge with a first in History.\n\nHe began his career as a journalist for several Fleet Street newspapers before working for Control Risks, a firm which assesses the risks to companies of terrorism and political upheaval, and provides services ranging from confidential investigations to kidnap resolution.\n\nIn 1996, he appeared on the BBC quiz show \"Mastermind\", where he reached the semi-finals. His specialist topics were comics creator Hergé and his creation \"Tintin\", and \"The Life and Novels of Dick Francis\", who was present at the recording.\n\nHe lives in Dorset with his wife, an interior designer, and their children.\n\nHis sister Belinda was also an author; her novel \"The Journal of Dora Damage\" was published posthumously in the UK and US in late 2007.

Le Guin. It premiered on the Sci-Fi Channel in December 2004.\n\nIn the land of Earthsea, a young wizard named Ged has visions about a girl and doors opening. Meanwhile, King Tygath wants to rule the land and release the Nameless Ones, demons from whom he hopes to learn the secret of immortality. He sends men to attack Ged's village, in search of the wizard of prophesy (Ged). Ged learns his first spell from an elderly woman. When the invasion comes, Ged uses a mist spell and lures the invaders over a cliff, saving the village. However, Ged also falls off the cliff.\n\nTygath tries to convince High Priestess Thar to release the Nameless Ones, but she refuses. She is poisoned by Rosa, her attendant who has been tricked by the king's lover, Kossil, every time she has tea.\n\nA magus named Ogion arrives at Ged's village and revives Ged. He tells Ged his true name and takes him for training, but Ged is too impatient; he is sent to the magic school on Roke. There he meets the bully, Jasper, and befriends a student named Vetch. Ged shapeshifts into a hawk to show off. Jasper then challenges him to raise a spirit from the dead, leading him to accidentally release a Nameless One. The demon attacks Ged before being driven away by the Archmagus, who tells him that this Nameless One will hunt Ged down and try to possess him, using Ged's power for further destruction. Ged must go somewhere in hiding until he can find its true name and destroy it.\n\nWith the help of Jasper, King Tygath takes control of the magic school. He throws a knife at the Archmagus, apparently killing him and making Jasper the new Archmagus.\n\nWith the help of Ogion, Ged confronts the Gebbeth and attempts to drown him using a rock, however, it escapes with Ged's likeness and voice. Ged's impersonator becomes a murderer, and Vetch, a magus himself, chases Ged until he realizes Ged is not possessed by the Gebbeth and they decide to hunt it together.\n\nThey are attacked by the dragon, Orm Embar, but Ged uses the dragon's true name to bind him and ask three questions. He wastes his first question, but with his second, he learns the Gebbeth's location. The dragon tells him where to find the two pieces of the Amulet of Peace, which when reunited would save Earthsea, but Ged could have asked the true name of the demon.\n\nMeanwhile, Thar appoints a successor, Tenar, and tells her the incantation to release the Nameless Ones. Kossil strangles Rosa and frames Tenar, leading to her imprisonment.\n\nGed and Vetch return to Roke for help in decoding the dragon's riddle. The Archmagus survived Tygath's attack and made the real Jasper into a village fool as punishment. He sends Ged and Vetch to unseal the Nameless Tombs on Atuan, but Ged is captured and brought before Thar, who mistakes him for an evil wizard.\n\nIn the labyrinth, Ged is locked in the cell next to Tenar. They break free and recognize each other from their visions. Thar realizes her mistake right before her death. Kossil tries to force Tenar to reveal the incantation and fails, so Tygath kills Kossil and follows Tenar to the gate of the Nameless Ones.\n\nVetch finds the tomb first and is taken by the Gebbeth. Ged encounters Tygath in the labyrinth and fights him but then escapes into the tomb. He encounters the Gebbeth and realizes its true name is his own, because it is the darkness in himself. The demon is absorbed into Ged, making him whole again and strengthening him to strike Tygath in the tomb. Tygath forces Tenar to release the Nameless Ones with the incantation. The Nameless Ones are released and take Tygath into the sky before flying off. Ged reveals part of the key is the second half of the amulet. The Amulet of Peace is made whole, dispelling the Nameless Ones with a bright light and restoring peace to Earthsea. Ged is seen victorious with Tenar and they kiss.\n\n\nThe series was produced by Hallmark Entertainment in association with Bender-Brown Productions. It was adapted by Gavin Scott (\"The Mists of Avalon\") from the Earthsea novels for executive producers Robert Halmi, Sr. (\"Merlin, Gulliver's Travels, Animal Farm\"), Lawrence Bender (\"Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction\") and Kevin Kelly Brown (\"Roswell\"). The series was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\n\nReviewing the miniseries, the book \" The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Fantasy\" claimed \"Legend of Earthsea\" \"totally missed the point\" of Le Guin's novels, \"ripping out all the subtlety, nuance and beauty of the books and inserting boring cliches, painful stereotypes and a very unwelcome 'epic' war in their place\". The Moria website's review of \"Legend of Earthsea\" states \"\"Earthsea\" feels exactly like tv filler. In the books, Ursula Le Guin expended a great deal of time creating a world with a depth and culture, but nothing of this survives in the mini-series\". The review also argues \"Legend of Earthsea\" \"is shabbily and indifferently directed\" and \"The dialogue is dreadfully clunky and often excruciatingly bad\".\n\nLe Guin, author of the novels on which the miniseries is based, was not involved in the development of the material or the making of the production. She has written a number of responses to the handling of this adaptation of her works, \"A Whitewashed Earthsea\" and \"Frankenstein's Earthsea\". She noted, \"When I sold the rights to \"Earthsea\" a few years ago, my contract gave me the standard status of \"consultant\"—which means whatever the producers want it to mean, almost always little or nothing.,\" and that, \"Mr. Lieberman, one of the producers, published a statement telling people what 'Ursula' (whom he has never met) 'intended' by the books. That changed the situation. They were taking advantage of my silence by sticking words in my mouth. I put a reply on my website...\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2285879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2285879", "title": "Naval Reactors", "text": "Naval Reactors\n\nNaval Reactors (NR) is an umbrella term for the U.S. government office that has comprehensive responsibility for safe and reliable operation of the United States Navy's nuclear propulsion program. A single entity, it has authority and reporting responsibilities within both the United States Department of the Navy (Chief of Naval Operations and the Naval Sea Systems Command, NAVSEA), and the United States Department of Energy (National Nuclear Security Administration).\n\nProgram responsibilities are delineated in Presidential Executive Order 12344 of February 1, 1982, and prescribed by Public Laws 98-525 of October 19, 1984 (42 USC 7158), and 106-65 of October 5, 1999 (50 USC 2406).\n\nSoon after his U.S. Navy service during World War II, Captain (later Admiral) Hyman G. Rickover became an early advocate of nuclear marine propulsion. Assigned to the Bureau of Ships in September 1947, Rickover received training in nuclear power at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and worked with the Bureau to explore the possibility of nuclear ship propulsion. In February 1949 he received an assignment to the Division of Reactor Development, United States Atomic Energy Commission and then assumed control of the Navy's effort as Director of the Naval Reactors Branch in the Bureau of Ships.\n\nThe office was originally a joint activity of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Ships. When the AEC was abolished, Naval Reactors became a joint effort of the Navy and the Energy Research and Development Administration, which partly replaced the AEC. In 1977, ERDA was combined with the Federal Energy Administration to form the U.S. Department of Energy. On the Navy side of the organization, the Bureau of Ships has transitioned since the 1950s to become the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), within which NR is Code 08, usually abbreviated NAVSEA 08 or SEA 08.\n\nWithin seven years of its inception, the organization that developed from this concept would put into operation the nation's first power reactor (the \"Nautilus\" prototype). The following four years would see three more nuclear submarines and two reactor plant prototypes operating and another seven ships and two prototypes being built. To date, more reactors have been built and safely operated by the NR program than any other US program.\n\nHyman G. Rickover parlayed an impressive personal publicity effort and intensive links with the United States Congress into an unprecedented tenure situation as head of Naval Reactors whereby he could not be relieved by conventional military procedures. He was promoted successively, partially as a result of Congressional involvement, until he reached the rank of full Admiral and held the position for over 30 years from 1949 to February 1, 1982 (when he was retired).\n\nThe history of nuclear propulsion and Rickover's influence and involvement is substantial. Due to the transcendent importance and impact of nuclear power, the AEC commissioned the creation of two related historical records to capture important facts of both naval nuclear propulsion and the Shippingport commercial reactor. Both of these official documents necessarily contain a good deal of information on Rickover's choices, methods and technical philosophy in the development of practical nuclear power, but are not biographies. While Rickover cooperated to provide real-time access to facilities, people and records, according to the authors he did not edit; Rickover was in-fact deceased before the second document was completed. These are: (1) \"Nuclear Navy, 1946-1962\" by AEC staff historians Richard G. Hewlett and Francis Duncan, and (2) \"Rickover and the Nuclear Navy: The Discipline of Technology\" by Francis Duncan. The AEC makes both of these documents directly available to the public in digital form.\n\nThe Director of Naval Reactors also concurrently serves as a Deputy Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration.\n\nMany books (including those referenced below) and articles have been written about core NR management principles such as attention to detail and adherence to rigidly-defined standards and specifications, as well as the organization's unique (for government) personnel practices. NR staff and alumni (including Admiral Rickover himself) have often been called by Congress, the President and other government agencies to provide expert opinion and management support to other important government programs, most notably the large scale reviews following the destruction of the Space Shuttles \"Columbia\" and \"Challenger\". NR alumni have also founded or led numerous corporate and industrial organizations, for example MPR Associates, Inc. , founded by three of Admiral Rickover's leading technical managers in NR's early days.\n\n"}

He was lead singer of the band Wall of Voodoo from 1983 to 1988. He went on to record solo albums, musicals and write a novel. \nPrieboy was born in Los Angeles and raised in East Chicago, Indiana. Early in his career, he was in the San Francisco art band Eye Protection, which had one track on the compilation \"Rising Stars of San Francisco\": \"Take Her Where The Boys Are\". They also recorded a 7-inch single called \"Elroy Jetson\" with a b-side of \"Go Go Girl\" on Eleph Records.\n\nLater, he replaced Stan Ridgway as the lead singer of Wall of Voodoo when Ridgway left the band in 1983. \"Seven Days in Sammystown\" was the first Wall of Voodoo album featuring Prieboy. This was followed up by \"Happy Planet\" and finally \"Ugly Americans in Australia\", which was a live album they recorded to fulfill their recording obligations to IRS Records.\n\nHis first Wall of Voodoo single \"Far Side of Crazy\" is featured in the film \"Head Office\". His demo for the song \"Man Talk\", which would finally appear on the album \"...Upon My Wicked Son\", was featured in the early Brad Pitt film \"Cutting Class\" as well as other unreleased Wall of Voodoo demos. These same demos appeared in the film \"\". He also appears in the film \"Blood and Concrete\" along with a few of his original songs (in that movie, Jennifer Beals sings his song, \"One Girl in a Million\").\n\nAfter leaving Wall of Voodoo, Prieboy signed with MCA Music Publishing as a songwriter and went to work on new material for his first solo record \"...Upon My Wicked Son\", which featured the song \"Tomorrow Wendy,\" about a woman dying of AIDS. The song featured a duet with Johnette Napolitano, whose band Concrete Blonde also recorded the song and released it on their album \"Bloodletting\" the same year. The music video was directed by Thomas Mignone. MTV initially rejected the song's lyrical content and tone but Prieboy and Mignone decided to feature the decaying cities of Hammond and Gary in Indiana as the \"Wendy\" character and the video received Buzz Bin status at MTV. The song was also covered by the industrial project System Syn in early 2000s. Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris covered his song \"Loving the Highway Man\" from the same album. Prieboy then released an EP called \"Montezuma Was a Man of Faith\" which featured a country rendition of \"Whole Lotta Love\" by Led Zeppelin, featuring an uncredited Johnette Napolitano from Concrete Blonde. Prieboy's second solo album was entitled \"Sins of Our Fathers\".\n\nIn the mid-to-late '90s Prieboy played shows at the Los Angeles club Largo with Rita D'Albert where they worked on an ongoing musical, \"White Trash Wins Lotto\"; a Gilbert and Sullivan-esque treatment of the rise and fall of an Axl Rose-like character. It was also performed at the Roxy Theatre on the Sunset Strip for three sold out weekend-long engagements as well as two sold out weekends at New York City's PS 122. Prieboy and crew also performed a medley from \"White Trash\" on the Conan O'Brien show.\n\nPrieboy is also the co-author with Merrill Markoe of the novel \"The Psycho Ex Game\", based on his song \"Psycho Ex\". Markoe and Prieboy have lived together since 2004.\n\nHe released several songs via his website for online purchase. In 2012 Prieboy released the four-song downloadable EP \"Every Lady Gets A Song\", featuring accompaniment by former Dils bassist Tony Kinman and Devo drummer David Kendrick.\n\nOn December 20, 2016 he released his lost album \"Virtue Triumphs\". The album was left unfinished and abandoned in 1992; it was meant to be the follow-up to his first solo work, \"...Upon My Wicked Son\". A corporate regime change ultimately swept him out, and the album stayed behind. This was his first body of work that was not beholden to Wall of Voodoo.\n\n"}

It has a market capitalisation of PLN 1,346 trillion (EUR 319 billion; as of May 12, 2017).\n\nThe WSE is a member of the Federation of European Securities Exchanges. On 17 December 2013, the WSE also joined the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) initiative.\n\nWarsaw became the capital and financial center of Poland in the early 17th century. In the Middle Ages other Polish towns, most of them members of the Hanse, were the leading economic centers of Poland. Merchants from western and southern Europe settled in Poland since the beginning of Polish statehood. They brought the system of organized exchange trading in securities, mostly bills and currencies, to Poland. The oldest Polish bill was issued in 1243 by the Cuyavien bishop Sambor. The main centers of securities tradings were at the lower Vistula, in the 14th century occupied by the Teutonic Knights. The first mercantile exchanges emerged in Gdańsk (1379), Toruń (1385), Malbork (14th century), Kraków (1405), Poznań (1429), Zamość (1590), Królewiec (1613) and Elbląg (1744). Mediaeval mercantile exchanges might have also existed for a short period in Chełmno, Grudziądz and Braniewo.\n\nEarly mercantile trade in securities emerged in Warsaw in the 15th and 16th century and was based on privileges by the Masovian Dukes and later Polish Kings. The original privileges are lost, but they have been mentioned and affirmed by King John II Casimir in 1658. An archetype of the Warsaw Exchange was first mentioned in 1624/1625. In 1643 Adam Zarzebski, the chief architect of King Władysław IV, mentioned a stone building on the Old Market Square as the seat of the Exchange, probably a part of the Old Town Hall. The securities trading minutes of the Warsaw merchants in the Old Town Hall have been recorded since 1757. The legal framework for the trading in securities was first codified by the Polish Sejm in 1775. As one of the first Polish corporations Kompania Manufaktur Welnianych issued its first 120 shares in 1768. The first Polish bonds were issued in 1782 by King Stanisław August.\n\nIn 1808 the Duchy of Warsaw adopted the Napoleonic code including the Code de Commerce. The Code de Commerce also regulated stock exchange law and there were efforts made to establish a state-organized exchange on the basis of this code in Warsaw. However, due to the Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna, the plans had to be postponed.\n\nThe first state-organized exchange in Poland, the \"Warsaw Mercantile Exchange\" (Giełda Kupiecka w Warszawie), was established in Warsaw by a decree of viceregent Grand Duke Constantine Romanov dated 12 May 1817. The first trading took place in the Old Town Hall on 16 May 1817 and moved in the same year to the Saxon Palace as the Old Town Hall was destroyed in the same year. Exchange trading in securities also was held in the trading house Marywil but were moved to the house of building of the Polish Central Bank in 1828 and to the building of the Financial Commission and Confraternity Harmonia in 1876, before in 1877 the Warsaw Mercantile Exchange moved into its own building at the Saxon Garden.\n\nThe Warsaw Mercantile Exchange grew rapidly. The number of brokers doubled between 1817 and 1822. In the first half of the 19th century mainly bills, debentures and bonds were traded, while share trading on a broader scale developed in the second half of that century. The first public security to be traded on the Warsaw Mercantile Exchange was the debentures of Towarzystwo Kredytowe Ziemskie issued in 1826. The first shares admitted to trading were issued by railroad companies in the 1840s. Until 1853 trading sessions were twice a week between 1pm and 2pm. In 1873 a new, more liberal, stock exchange act was passed, separating the trade in securities and commodities. A separate Warsaw Commodities Exchange was founded in 1874. Central Europe was subject to a big bull market after the Prussian-Franco War of 1870-1871, followed by a harsh crash starting at the Vienna Stock Exchange in the later 1870s. However, the Warsaw Mercantile Exchange constantly grew until the First World War. In 1915 Warsaw was occupied by German and Austrian forces and the exchange was closed down during the later years of the war.\n\nThe \"Warsaw Money Exchange\" (Giełda Pieniężna w Warszawie) was reopened after the First World War in 1919 and again in 1921. Between 1919 and 1939, the Warsaw Money Exchange was by far the largest of several bourses in different Polish cities (Katowice, Kraków, Lwów, Łódź, Poznań and Wilno), and accounted for 95% of the volume and 65 to 85% of the transactions traded on the Polish capital market. The Warsaw Money Exchange had more than 150 participants, 25 brokers, and more than 130 issuers. Its yearly turnover amounted to 1 billion PLZ. A new stock exchange law was passed in 1921 and again in 1926 and 1935. The Polish exchanges were subject to the world crises of 1929, but they recovered in the second half of the 1930s until the Second World War. In 1939 Poland was occupied by German and Russian forces and all Polish stock exchanges were closed by the aggressors.\n\nIt was only after the fall of the communist regime in 1989, that the Warsaw Stock Exchange could be reestablished. Much needed experience and financial aid was provided by France (especially the Société des Bourses Françaises). The WSE began activity in its present form on 16 April 1991. On the first trading day only five stocks were listed (Tonsil, Próchnik, Krosno, Kable, and Exbud). Seven brokerages took part in the trading, and there were 112 buy and sell orders, with a turnover of only 1,990 złotys ($2,000).\n\nIn the years 1991–2000, the stock exchange was in the building which during the previous, and then recent, communist years had been the seat of the Central Committee of the ruling Polish United Workers' Party. This can be considered an interesting reflection on the rapid transition of Poland from a communist to a market economy.\n\nSince then the WSE has been developing and growing rapidly and is now perceived as well established on the European market. In September 2008 the stock exchange was recognized as an \"Advanced Emerging\" exchange by FTSE, alongside markets from such countries as South Korea or Taiwan.\n\nOn 29 September 2017, the index provider FTSE Russell has announced the results of the annual classification of markets. Polish market has been upgraded from Emerging Market to Developed Market status.\n\nThe legal framework for exchange operations is provided by three acts from 29 July 2005:\n\n\nAdditionally, the WSE is governed by the Code of Commercial Companies of 2000, the Statutes of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, the Rules of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, and the Rules of the Stock Exchange Court.\n\nThe WSE is a joint stock company founded by the State Treasury. The Treasury holds 35% share in capital.\n\nThe following instruments are traded on the WSE: shares, bonds, subscription rights, allotments, and derivatives such as futures, options, and index participation units.\n\nSince its inception, the WSE has engaged in electronic trading. The WARSET trading platform has been in use from November 2000 to April 2013; it has been superseded by the UTP platform, based on the NYSE Euronext platform formerly having the same name. An additional market called NewConnect was introduced on 30 August 2007.\n\nThe exchange has pre-market sessions from 08:00am to 09:00am, normal trading sessions from 09:00am to 04:50pm and post-market sessions from 04:50pm to 05:00pm on all days of the week except Saturdays, Sundays and holidays declared by the Exchange in advance.\n\nThe capitalisation of 432 domestic companies listed on the Main Market was PLN 645.0 billion (EUR 152.6 billion) at the end of June 2017. \nThe total capitalisation of 483 domestic and foreign companies listed on the GPW Main Market was PLN 1,316.5 billion (EUR 311.5 billion) at the end of June 2017.\nTotal value of trade in equities on the Main Market was PLN 30.3 billion\n\nThere are fifteen indices on the WSE.\n\n\n\n"}

He was born in the 13th district quarter Újlipótváros of the Royal Hungarian capital city of Austria-Hungary. At birth, his twin brother was born dead and his mother died soon after childbirth. He spent most of his childhood years with his aunt's family whose husband Dezső Grosz was one of the owners of the textile company in which his father worked until his death in 1921.\n\nRadnóti attended primary and secondary school in his place of birth and continued his education at the high school for textile industry in Liberec from 1927–28 on his uncle's advice. Then he worked as commercial correspondent in the familiar textile business company until 1930. Ultimately, Radnóti was able to prevail with desire for another education and began studying philosophy, Hungarian and French language at the University of Szeged. \n\nIn 1934, he finished his studies with the philosophical doctoral thesis \"The artistic development of Margit Kaffka\". After graduation, he changed his name to Radnóti, after the birthplace Radnovce (Hungarian: Radnót) of his paternal grandfather. In August 1935, he married his long-standing love Fanny (1912-2014), daughter of the owner of the respected Gyarmati printing house. The very happy marriage was unfortunately childless until his deportation. In the school year of 1935-36 he gained first professional experiences as high school teacher at the Zsigmond Kemény Gymnasium in Budapest. \n\nIn September 1940, he was conscripted to a Jewish labor battalion of the Hungarian Army until December of that year, then from July 1942 to April 1943 for the second time. On 2 May 1943, he converted together with his wife from Judaism to Roman Catholic faith. In May 1944, Radnóti's third military service started and his battalion was deported to Bor in Serbia. After 1943, Hungarian-Jewish forced laborers were imprisoned nearby Bor's copper mines which covered 50 percent of the copper requirement of the German war industry. \n\nOn 17 September 1944, Radnóti, who at the time was working as a kapo was forced to leave the camp in a column of about 3,600 prisoners because of the military offensive by Allied armies. He sustained the inhuman forced march from Bor to Szentkirályszabadja, where he wrote his last poem on 31 October. In November 1944, he and twenty other prisoners were shot and killed by members of the Hungarian Guards because of their total physical and mental exhaustion. Different dates of his death have been given. Some publications specify a day in the period from 6 to 10 November. In the detailed and scientific exhibition of 2009 by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, 4 November was said to be the date of death. Today it takes about 1 hour and 30 minutes to drive the 110 kilometers by car from Szentkirályszabadja to Abda. Radnóti is buried in the Kerepesi Cemetery with his wife. In 2013, his statue in Abda was damaged, but the reason for the damage has still not been clarified.\n\n\nMiklós Radnóti was Hungarian translator of works by Jean de La Fontaine and Guillaume Apollinaire.

Ocean water differs in temperature and salinity. Warm surface water is generally saltier than the cooler deep or polar waters; in polar regions, the upper layers of ocean water are cold and fresh. Deep ocean water makes up about 90% of the volume of the oceans. Deep ocean water has a very uniform temperature, around 0-3°C, and a salinity of about 3.5% or as oceanographers state as 35 ppt (parts per thousand).\n\nIn specialized locations such as the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii NELHA ocean water is pumped to the surface from approximately 900 metres (3000 feet) deep for applications in research, commercial and pre-commercial activities. DOW is typically used to describe ocean water at sub-thermal depths sufficient to provide a measurable difference in water temperature.\n\nWhen deep ocean water is brought to the surface, it can be used for a variety of things. Its most useful property is its temperature. At the surface of the Earth, most water and air is well above 3 °C. The difference in temperature is indicative of a difference in energy. Where there is an energy gradient, skillful application of engineering can harness that energy for productive use by humans.\n\nThe simplest use of cold water is for air conditioning: using the cold water itself to cool air saves the energy that would be used by the compressors for traditional refrigeration. Another use could be to replace expensive desalination plants. When cold water passes through a pipe surrounded by humid air, condensation results. The condensate is pure water, suitable for humans to drink or for crop irrigation. Via a technology called Ocean thermal energy conversion, the temperature difference can be turned into electricity.\n\nDuring condensation or Ocean thermal energy conservation operations, the water does not reach ambient temperature, because a certain temperature gradient is required to make these processes viable. The water leaving those operations is therefore still colder than the surroundings, and a further benefit can be extracted by passing this water through underground pipes, thereby cooling agricultural soil. This reduces evaporation, and even causes water to condense from the atmosphere. This allows agricultural production where crops would normally not be able to grow. This technique is sometimes referred to as \"cold agriculture\" or \"cold-bed agriculture\".\n\n"}

In 1931 he graduated from the Yugoslav reserve officers school as a sergeant-pilot. After the Axis invasion and establishment of Independent State of Croatia in 1941 he was drafted into the Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia and was stationed in Banja Luka.\n\nIn the second half of May 1942, like Rudi Čajavec before him, he defected to the Partisans with his Potez 25 aircraft. From the improvised airfield near Prijedor he carried out a number of sorties against Axis forces, the most notable being the attack on an Ustaša column near Orahovo on 4 June. His plane was destroyed by hostile fire on 6 July.\n\nHe then became a member of the Partisan command for Bosanska Krajina region.

In 1903 he opened his first bookshop with his brother Gilbert and by the late 1920s the business had grown so rapidly that their bookstore in Charing Cross Road held a stock of four million volumes on over thirty miles of bookshelves, and the name of Foyle had become synonymous with bookselling in London. His vision for the business was a bookshop for the world - for every one from any station in life - \"The People's Bookshop\". His inspiration was James Lackington's late 18th century \"Temple of Muses\" at Chiswell Street, London.\n\nThe Foyle brothers were determined to create the greatest bookshop in the world. Foyles became increasingly popular with customers and members of the public throughout the world.

He won a total of 39 Olympic titles and World championships, more than any other fencer in the history of the sport. His Olympic medals include one individual gold, five team golds, five silver, and two bronze medals from 1936 to 1960.\n\nFencing is one of the original sports from the 1896 Games. Electronic scoring equipment was introduced in 1936 in the épée events when Mangiarotti won a gold medal with the other members of the Italian team. He consistently won each épée event and was second only to expert Christian d'Oriola in the foil events. On a points for and against basis in international competition, Mangiarotti was the most successful fencer in history.\n\nEdoardo Mangiarotti was born into a famous fencing family on 7 April 1919. Giuseppe Mangiarotti, a Milanese fencing master and 17 times national épée champion, planned his son’s championship career and molded him into an awkward opponent by converting a natural right-hander to a left-hander. Dario Mangiarotti, older brother of the great Edoardo, won the world title in Cairo in 1949 and a gold and two silver in the Olympics. His brother Mario Mangiarotti was also a fencer.\n\nEdoardo was a national junior foil champion at the age of 11. He won a place in the Italian senior team at age 16 and competed in the 1935 world championships. The following year young Mangiarotti rewarded his father for his conscientious coaching with an Olympic team épée gold medal in the Olympics.\n\nIn Paris, 1937, Edoardo Mangiarotti won a gold medal in a World Championships team event. The next year in Czechoslovakia he finished second in the individual épée, won a bronze in the team épée and a gold in team foil.\n\nEven at such an early stage in his career, the young Mangiarotti showed the strong determination and personality that was to separate him from other international competitors in both foil and épée in the 1950s.\nAt the 1948 London Olympics, Mangiarotti finished with a bronze medal in the individual épée and two team silver medals. Dario Mangiarotti could not compete because of an injury.\n\nIn 1949, Dario won the individual épée World Championship in Cairo while his younger brother participated in the winning épée and foil teams. Two years later Edoardo forged to the top in individual épée by winning the world championships in Stockholm.\n\nThe Helsinki Games in 1952 were the crowning glory for the Mangiarotti brothers. Against a record field of 76 competitors Edoardo Mangiarotti won the Olympic épée individual gold medal with decisive style. After a somewhat shaky start in the final he ran out the winner with seven victories. His brother had won the silver from Switzerland’s Oswald Zappelli, who had beaten Edoardo for the silver medal in the previous Olympics.\n\nThe record created at the Helsinki Olympics by the Mangiarotti brothers may be second only to their countrymen the Nadi brothers. While Edoardo secured two gold medals for the épée team and individual titles and two silver medals for the foil team and individual, his brother won a gold medal for the épée team event and a silver for the individual to give the family a remarkable six medals. This compares with the 9 medals, 8 gold and 1 silver, won by Nedo Nadi (5 gold) and his brother Aldo Nadi (3 gold, 1 silver) in the 1920 Olympics, all in fencing. (reference www.olympic.org)\n\nBy the Melbourne Olympics, Edoardo was a fraction past his best but he refused to leave the international arena without a fight. In the individual épée, Australian spectators were treated to a dramatic finale. Three Italians finished equal first, each with five wins and two losses. A barrage had to be held to sort out the medal winners. The drama heightened after the first section of the play off when Mangiarotti, Carlo Pavesi and Giuseppe Delfino all had one win and one loss. The second barrage broke the deadlock; Mangiarotti tired towards midnight and lost both his bouts, then Pavesi beat Delfino to clinch the gold medal. The Italians had a clean sweep of the medals with Mangiarotti taking the bronze. As compensation he won gold in both épée and foil team events.\n\nAt the 1960 Games in Rome, Mangiarotti now a 41-year-old, and the oldest on the Italian team, won a silver medal in the team foil behind the Soviet squad that boasted individual champion Zhdanovich. The Italian épée squad which included Mangiarotti and individual gold medalist Delfino won the team event from a brilliant British squad led by Bill Hoskyns the 1958 World individual champion.\nThis was Mangiarotti's 13th and last Olympic medal, breaking the previous record of 12 by Paavo Nurmi at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. His record would stand until the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, when Larisa Latynina would win her 18th medal, a record which stood until broken by Michael Phelps on 31 July 2012 at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.\n\nMangiarotti retired in 1961 and left the Olympic fencing arena as the greatest combined épée and foil fencer the world had ever seen. His participation in world and Olympic championships spanned 25 years and resulted in an amazing 39 top three placings. This five time Olympian was awarded a Bronze Olympic order in 1977.\n\nIn 2003, the International Olympic Committee awarded Edoardo Mangiarotti with a Platinum Wreath, with a document which stated that: \"Edoardo Mangiarotti's total of 39 gold, silver & bronze medals in Olympic & World Fencing Championships which earns him the distinction of being the greatest Fencer in that sport's history.\"\n\n\n"}

Kearney partners as A.T. Kearney was in the process of selling itself to EDS, an IT outsourcing conglomerate. The original Mitchell Madison Group had about 120 professionals in 1994.\n\nThe firm experienced rapid growth in the 1990s, primarily in its strategic sourcing practice, serving large financial institutions. With 16 offices and almost 1,000 employees, \"Fortune\" magazine named it one of the top 50 firms to work for in 1999. The firm was sold in late 1999 for about $300 million to USWeb, a Web design company which expanded during the dot-com bubble into management consulting. Subsequently, USWeb merged with Whitman-Hart, another consulting firm based in Chicago. The combined company, a merger of equals, had over 10,000 employees with annual revenues exceeding $1 billion and soon renamed itself \"marchFIRST\". With the burst of the dot-com bubble, marchFIRST went into bankruptcy in April 2001 and its assets were liquidated.\n\nIn 2003, Hans Dau with other partners, who were running the West Coast offices of the original Mitchell Madison Group, re-launched the firm by acquiring the brand name in bankruptcy court. By 2008, the firm had grown to about 150 employees with main offices on New York, Los Angeles and Manila and several satellite offices in Europe and Asia.\n\nThe firm is featured, although not by name, in Matthew Stewart's book \"The Management Myth\". Stewart takes care not to state the name of the firm, but he does say that it was bought out by an Internet company whose CEO was named \"Joe\" and believed in UFOs.\n\nThe firm has operations in several US cities and Asia. Hans Dau is the firm's Managing Partner. \n\nThe Mitchell Madison Group works with large corporations in the US, Asia, and Europe on a variety of performance improvement, analytics and strategy issues. Consistent with trends in the industry, MMG is working with Private Equity firm's portfolio companies on similar issues. Much of the consulting industry has shifted its focus on servicing Private Equity clients, due to their higher level of motivation to improve earnings and their experience with management consultants. In fact, the Private Equity governance model depends on fast performance improvement to add value quickly. In any large corporation, getting, say $10M in earnings improvement does not provide sufficient motivation for management to overcome organizational or political obstacles. In a Private Equity owned company, however, $10M EBITDA is equivalent to 10x or more in equity value upon exit, hence the higher level of motivation. \n\nMMG is a functional specialist, as opposed to being focussed on particular client industries, having served the tech, telecom, banking, insurance, entertainment, healthcare, business services, and manufacturing industries. Consistent with a resurgence of manufacturing in the US and globally, the firm frequently assists major manufacturing companies with cost reduction initiatives. \nMuch of the work is global strategic sourcing, which is becoming more important as manufacturers seek to diversify their global supply chain in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Mitchell Madison Group is hiring various positions in the US and recruits on campus at major universities. MMG's recruiting strategy is more focussed on demonstrated problem-solving skills, intelligence and creativity than on past business experience. The firm's recruiting process is fairly typical and similar to other firms, making use of testing and interview case problem-solving. \n\nMMG is also active in MBA and selected PhD recruiting. \n"}

In 1829 he founded the literary magazine \"Revue de Paris\", and from 1838 to 1852 was owner and director of \"Le Constitutionnel\", in which he published Eugene Sue's novel based on the legend of the \"Wandering Jew\". It was also during Véron's direction and at his suggestion that Sainte-Beuve contributed the \"Causeries du lundi\", an early example of the regular newspaper column.\n\nHe is largely known to history for his direction, from 1831-1835, of the Paris Opera. The new government, after the July Revolution of 1830, wished to offload the costs and responsibilities of the Opera, which had been effectively state-controlled since its inception. Véron saw the great potential of adapting the Opera to the bourgeois tastes of new audiences and applied for the franchise, which brought with it limited State subsidy. By bringing together the talents of designers (such as Duponchel), composers (such as Meyerbeer, Auber and Fromental Halévy), and librettists (such as Eugene Scribe and Casimir Delavigne), and developing great singers such as Adolphe Nourrit and Cornélie Falcon, he created the genre of Grand Opera. The first new production under Véron's management, Meyerbeer's \"Robert le diable\" (21 November 1831) began a new era in opera. When the government decided to further reduce subsidy of the Opera in 1835, Véron prudently withdrew, having made a substantial profit.\n\nIn 1852 Véron was elected to the \"Corps Législatif\" (the predecessor of the Chamber of Deputies). His \"Memoires d'un bourgeois de Paris (1853–1855)\" give a lively picture of his life and times.\nVéron was eccentric in his appearance and behaviour. A contemporary, Philarete Chasles, describes him as follows:\n\nRuddy, with a pock-marked face, barely any nose, scrofulous, his neck enfolded in cloth that protected and hid his affliction, pot-bellied; [...] mouth smiling, lips thick, hair rare, eyebrows absent, dressed like a little lackey aping his master and with the affectations and the mincing airs of the salon (quoted in Kelly, 2004 – see below).\n\n"}

It was one of Hungary's first commercial TV channels and began broadcasting only three days after its main rival TV2.\n\nSince its start, RTL Klub has focused to gain viewers from the urban population. The channel airs programs mostly for a younger (18-49) audience.\n\nRTL Klub and TV2 aired two similar major reality series simultaneously. While TV2 purchased the rights of \"Big Brother\", RTL Klub produced its own series called \"Való Világ\" (Real World). \"Való Világ\" had three seasons between 2002 and 2004. Since its second season the show has been much more successful than the rival \"Big Brother\".\n\nRTL Klub is the most watched TV channel in Hungary since 2002, thanks to the daily Hungarian soap opera \"Barátok közt\" (Among Friends), which is the most watched TV programme in Hungary with more than 2 million viewers; the tabloid magazine \"Fókusz\" (Focus) and the game show \"Legyen Ön is milliomos\" (\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\"). Millionaire is off the schedule from September 2007 after seven years and has replaced by \"A Széf\" (\"Take It Or Leave It\").\n\nFrom the fall-winter season of 2005-2006, RTL Klub has started to broadcast popular American TV shows like \"Lost\". The first episode of \"Lost\" had almost 2 million viewers, and a 50% share. This was a record. The next year Prison Break started with almost 1.6 million. Nowadays a TV show at prime time (21:00) can reach 1-1.5 million viewers. In season 2006-2007 \"Prison Break\" was the most watched American series in Hungary.\n\nFrom the fall season of 2007, RTL Klub has launched two new formats with great success. Poker Face ran like a tournament for six weeks with an average 38-42% share. The other new show was \"Csillag születik\", the Hungarian version of the RTL \"Got Talent\" format. \"Poker Face\" ended with the super final at 18 December and the time slot of it will be occupied by the new game show \"A Széf\" (\"Take It or Leave it\").\n\nRTL Klub was the only licensed broadcaster of Formula One in Hungary from 2002 until 2011. After 10 years RTL decided not to renew the licence for Formula 1. The reason was that they wanted to concentrate mainly for the prime time programs because of the shrinking advertising market.\n\nRTL Klub has been the only licensed broadcaster of Domino Day in Hungary, for 6 years (2004-2009).\n\nFrom 2010, RTL Klub started with 2 winning formats. First of all the channel after 6 years absence successfully relaunched the Való Világ franchise. VV4 ran with a 40% SHR among 18-49 demographic. Secondly they purchased the rights of television talent show The X Factor. The show ran with a 50% SHR among 18-49 demographic which is really high on the Hungarian television market. The Factor crashed the competitor talent show on TV2 so \"Megasztár\" left the time slot of \"The X Factor\" after a few episodes. Because of the success of both format, RTL Klub renewed both show for the 5th and 2nd season respectively. They started in the fall season of 2011.\n\n\n\nRTL Klub has many sister channels. One of the owners of RTL Klub is \"IKO Kábeltévé Kft.\", which owned Cool, Film+, Sportklub (which ceased on 30 April 2016), Sportklub+ (which is a non-airing channel since 15 October 2009), DoQ (which closed on 31 March 2019), F&H, Sorozat+, Poén! (which became Prizma in 20 December 2010 and RTL+ on 1 May 2014), Reflektor (which closed on 31 December 2012) and Film+ 2 (which was replaced by RTL Gold on 3 July 2017), all of which are in some way related to IKO's primary channel, RTL Klub. In July 2011, RTL Group acquired seven TV channels from IKO Kábeltévé (Cool, Film+, Film+ 2, Prizma TV, Sorozat+, Reflektor TV, Muzsika TV). Tematic Cable Entertainment bought Sportklub, DoQ and F&H in 2013 from the RTL Group. Prizma TV airs since 1 May 2014 as .\n\nOriginally Cool had the target audience of 15-29 urban youths who love music, externals, clothes, trendy lifestyle and extravagance. The channel was launched on 15 September 2003 and it is available in 2.5 million households. The channel is on a 24/7 broadcast schedule, targeting audience not only during the day, but during the night as well. Cool airs reruns of series RTL Klub originally purchased or produced as well as series targeting today's youth. These include: \"South Park\", \"Married... with Children\" (\"Egy rém rendes család\"), \"24\", \"Footballer's Wives\" (\"Futbalista feleségek\"), \"The L Word\" (\"L\"), \"Queer as Folk\" (\"A fiúk a klubból\"), \"The Unit\" (\"Az egység\"), \"Dead Like Me\" (\"Haláli hullák\"), \"Weeds\" (\"Spangli\"), \"Skins\" (\"Skins\"), \"Desperate Housewives\" (\"Született feleségek\")\n\nIn 2007, Cool launched a series of topical shows produced by the channel, such as \"Cool Live and Cool Night\", featuring younger hosts lent to Cool by RTL Klub. The earlier is a youth lifestyle show, and the latter is an adult show including interviews with Hungarian porn stars and producers, as well as occasionally shown soft-core video clips. , these talk shows are cancelled.\n\nIn 2009, Cool purchased the airing rights of the successful Hungarian version of \"Whose line is it anyway?\", Beugró.\n\nOn 30 August 2010, Cool rebranded, opening for a wider audience. Since then the channel airs mostly crime procedurals like the , \"Bones\", \"Castle\", Cobra 11, The Mentalist, etc. The move was successful because as of July 2012, Cool TV is the third watched commercial TV channel, and most watched cable channel in Hungary (target audience 18-49, prime time 19.00-23.00), beating main competitor Viasat 3.\n\nOn 1 December 2014, Cool rebranded to its current ident package, and from 1 January 2015 onwards, the channel is available in HD too.\n\nFilm+ was launched on 15 September 2003, the same time as Cool. The channel airs movies which previously aired on RTL Klub 24/7. According to the 2012 Hungarian television ratings, Film+ is the third-most-watched cable channel in Hungary. Due to the early success of the channel, the parent company launched Film+ 2, which aired movies in the same fashion as Film+, but it closed on 3 July 2017 to make way for RTL Gold, a channel which airs old episodes of RTL Klub's old game shows and talkshows.\n\nThe channel is available in HD since New Year's Day 2015.\n\nFilm+ 2 was a non-violent family channel. It launched on 2 April 2008. This movie channel was devoted partly to female audiences, and partly to family films during the evenings and weekends. It offered comedies, romantic films, adventures and dramas. In the RTL cable portfolio, Film+ 2 was the channel that broadcasts most Hungarian films.\n\nIt closed down on 3 July 2017 to make way for RTL Gold.\n\nSportklub was launched on 2 January 2006. RTL Klub purchased the broadcasting rights of the FIFA World Cup 2006 but it didn't have enough airing time for all of the matches, and therefore Sport Klub was launched by the parent company to fill in. Sportklub aired various sport activities, such as the French and Italian football league (as partner of Digi Sport), tennis, poker, NCAA, athletics, futsal and box. The channel reran the Formula-1 broadcast of the parent channel to 2011. It aired certain matches of the English and the Spanish league, however its main competitors, the sports channels run by the Hungarian public service television MTV, Sport1 and Sport2, have the first pick of the matches they would like to air. To ease up the load on Sportklub, the parent company also launched Sportklub+ in September 2007, which aired sports events deemed to attract less viewers than the parent channel, but it closed on 15 October 2009.\n\nSportklub closed down in Hungary on 30 April 2016.\n\nSportklub is also available in countries close to Hungary in which countries IKO also operates, including Romania, Poland, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia.\n\nIn September 2011, RTL Klub started a project named RTL2 to launch a new RTL channel in Hungary. In April, 2012 it was announced, that RTL will launch RTL II in September or in October with \"I Love Gjoni\" (reality show); \"Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?\" (Hungarian version) and \"Heti Hetes\" (weekly comedy show on Sunday nights).\n\nIn July 2012, something started to promoted on RTL Klub with these sentences: \"The Life is Nice\" (Hungarian: \"Az élet szép.\"), \"The Sky is Blue\" (\"Az ég kék.\"), \"The Grass is Green\" (\"A fű zöld.\"), but it wasn't mentioned that these ads are advertising something. In September 2012, it was revealed that these ads advertised RTL2, the new commercial television channel what will launch on October 1, 2012 and it will replace Reflektor TV. In September, it suddenly became an Internet meme but bloggers and net users were disappointed when they got know the promotion is about \"\"just\"\" a new TV channel.\n\nAt the launch the prime-time schedule of RTL II included series: \"Modern Family\", \"White Collar\", \"Terra Nova\", \"Journeyman\", \"The Forgotten\", \"Chase\", shows moved from RTL Klub: \"Who Wants to be a Millionaire\" and \"Heti Hetes\" and a new magazine \"Forró nyomon\".\n\nIt launched as Poén! on 2 April 2008, then it was renamed as Prizma on 20 December 2010. Prizma’s focus was on entertainment and its purpose was to provide something attractive for each generation. Most of its programming consisted of beloved familiars, but there were some new audience favourites, too. It airs as since 1 May 2014.\n\nSorozat+ is the channel for fans of series - for those who live in anticipation of the next episode. Sorozat+ offers something for each member of the family, from Latin-American telenovelas to top US series. It launched on 2 April 2008.\n\nMuzsika TV is a music channel that offers a mix of traditional and modern pieces, featuring the greatest stars of folk and pop music as well as operettas and musicals. It launched on 6 November 2009.\n\n"}

He is the only fencer to win a gold medal in each of the three weapons at a single Olympic Games and won the most fencing gold medals ever at a single Games—five. Until Mark Spitz won seven swimming championships at the 1972 Summer Olympics, this was also the record number of gold medals won at a single Games by any competitor. Nadi won six Olympic gold medals in total.\n\nNedo Nadi was born in Livorno, Italy, the elder son of famous Italian fencing master, Giuseppe (Beppe) Nadi. He had a younger brother, Aldo who was an Olympic gold medallist in his own right. Nedo had his first fencing lesson with a foil at the age of seven in his father’s gymnasium at Livorno. His father taught him foil and sabre but believed the épée to be an \"undisciplined\" weapon and refused to teach it. The brothers therefore used to go and practice by themselves and were essentially self-taught. At the age of fourteen Nedo won a solid silver trophy for his three weapon work during the Jubilee celebration of Emperor Franz Joseph at Vienna.\n\nCompeting for his country at 1912 Stockholm Olympics, Nadi became the youngest fencer to win a foil gold medal. Aged 18 years and 29 days, he beat teammate Pietro Speciale and Richard Verderber of Austria for the individual gold with seven straight victories in the final pool.\n\nNadi served in the Italian Army during World War I and was decorated for bravery.\n\nNadi resumed his competitive career after World War I was over. Defeated central European countries and the Soviet Union did not attend the Antwerp games. This meant that Hungary, one of the strongest fencing nations, would be absent. Nadi therefore decided to expand his chances for gold and entered all three fencing disciplines.\n\nNedo Nadi’s 1920 Olympic performances were acclaimed as near to perfection as a fencer could execute. Nadi won the individual foil gold medal with a record 10 wins in the final pool. Frenchman, Roger Ducret, who won bronze went on to win the individual gold in 1924, after Nadi had retired from the Olympic arena.\n\nNadi’s entry in the épée event annoyed his father, who regarded the épée as \"a crude and undisciplined weapon”. Unlike the foil, where a fencer could only score off a hit which landed on the trunk of the opponent’s body, or the sabre where the upper torso and face mask count as scoring hits, in épée any part of the body is a legitimate hit. Nevertheless, Nedo Nadi led the Italian épée team, which included his brother Aldo, to the Olympic team gold medal.\n\nNedo Nadi's perfect balance, timing and rapid reflexes were an advantage in any style of fencing, so without much difficulty he won the individual sabre gold medal by 11 victories to 9. His brother Aldo won the silver medal. In the team sabre event, the Italian team supported their star fencer and cruised to an easy victory.\n\nNadi, carried in triumph by his opponents, added three team victories to his tally of two individual golds and his younger brother Aldo won three team gold and one silver to make the family total a record for any sport in one Olympic Games.\n\nAldo and Nedo only fenced each other once in public and that match was drawn. Aldo moved to Hollywood where he worked in the film industry.\n\nAfter his Antwerp Olympic victories Nadi turned professional and took up coaching at the Buenos Aires Jockey Club. He returned to Rome some years later and was reinstated as an amateur. From 1935 to his death in January 1940 he served as president of the Italian Fencing Federation.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2286012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2286012", "title": "Adaptation model of nursing", "text": "Adaptation model of nursing\n\nIn 1976, Sister Callista Roy developed the Adaptation Model of Nursing, a prominent nursing theory. Nursing theories frame, explain or define the practice of nursing. Roy's model sees the individual as a set of interrelated systems (biological, psychological and social). The individual strives to maintain a balance between these systems and the outside world, but there is no absolute level of balance. Individuals strive to live within a unique band in which he or she can cope adequately.\n\nThis model comprises the four domain concepts of person, health, environment, and nursing; it also involves a six-step nursing process. Andrews & Roy (1991) state that the person can be a representation of an individual or a group of individuals. Roy's model sees the \"person\" as \"a biopsychosocial being in constant interaction with a changing environment\". The person is an open, adaptive system who uses coping skills to deal with stressors. Roy sees the \"environment\" as \"all conditions, circumstances and influences that surround and affect the development and behaviour of the person\". Roy describes stressors as stimuli and uses the term \"residual stimuli\" to describe those stressors whose influence on the person is not clear. Originally, Roy wrote that health and illness are on a continuum with many different states or degrees possible. More recently, she states that health is the process of being and becoming an integrated and whole person. Roy's goal for nursing is \"the promotion of adaptation in each of the four modes, thereby contributing to the person's health, quality of life and dying with dignity\". These four modes are physiological, self-concept, role function and interdependence.\n\nRoy employs a six-step nursing process: assessment of behaviour; assessment of stimuli; nursing diagnosis; goal setting; intervention and evaluation. In the first step, the person's behaviour in each of the four modes is observed. This behaviour is compared with norms and is deemed either adaptive or ineffective. The second step is concerned with factors that influence behaviour. Stimuli are classified as focal, contextual or residual. The nursing diagnosis is the statement of the ineffective behaviours along with the identification of the probable cause. This is typically stated as the nursing problem related to the focal stimuli, forming a direct relationship. In the fourth step, goal setting is the focus. Goals need to be realistic and attainable and are set in collaboration with the person. There are usually both short term and long term goals that the nurse sets for the patient. Intervention occurs as the fifth step, and this is when the stimuli are manipulated. It is also called the 'doing phase' . In the final stage, evaluation takes place. The degree of change as evidenced by change in behaviour, is determined. Ineffective behaviours would be reassessed, and the interventions would be revised.\n\nThe model had its inception in 1964 when Roy was a graduate student. She was challenged by nursing faculty member Dorothy E. Johnson to develop a conceptual model for nursing practice. Roy's model drew heavily on the work of Harry Helson, a physiologic psychologist. The Roy adaptation model is generally considered a \"systems\" model; however, it also includes elements of an \"interactional\" model. The model was developed specifically for the individual client, but it can be adapted to families and to communities (Roy, 1983). Roy states (Clements and Roberts, 1983) that \"just as the person as an adaptive system has input, output. and internal processes so too the family can be described from this perspective.\"\n\nBasic to Roy's model are three concepts: the human being, adaptation, and nursing. The human being is viewed as a biopsychosocial being who is continually interacting with the environment. The human being's goal through this interaction is adaptation. According to Roy and Roberts (1981, p. 43), ‘The person has two major internal processing subsystems, the regulator and the cognator.\" These subsystems are the mechanisms used by human beings to cope with stimuli from the internal and external environment. The regulator mechanism works primarily through the autonomic nervous system and includes endocrine, neural, and perception pathways. This mechanism prepares the individual for coping with environmental stimuli. The cognator mechanism includes emotions, perceptual/information processing, learning, and judgment. The process of perception bridges the two mechanisms (Roy and Roberts, 1981).\n\n\nLevine believes that an individual's adaptation occurs in four different modes. This also holds true for families (Hanson, 1984). These include the physiologic mode, the self-concept mode, the role function mode, and the interdependence mode.\n\nThe individual's regulator mechanism is involved primarily with the physiologic mode, whereas the cognator mechanism is involved in all four modes (Roy and Roberts, 1981). The family goals correspond to the model's modes of adaptation: survival = physiologic mode; growth = self-concept mode; continuity = role function mode. Transactional patterns fall into the interdependence mode (Clements and Roberts, 1983).\n\nIn the physiologic mode, adaptation involves the maintenance of physical integrity. Basic human needs such as nutrition, oxygen, fluids, and temperature regulation are identified with this mode (Fawcett, 1984). In assessing a family, the nurse would ask how the family provides for the physical and survival needs of the family members.\nA function of the self-concept mode is the need for maintenance of psychic integrity. Perceptions of one's physical and personal self are included in this mode. Families also have concepts of themselves as a family unit. Assessment of the family in this mode would include the amount of understanding provided to the family members, the solidarity of the family, the values of the family, the amount of companionship provided to the members, and the orientation (present or future) of the family (Hanson, 1984).\n\nThe need for social integrity is emphasized in the role function mode. When human beings adapt to various role changes that occur throughout a lifetime, they are adapting in this mode. According to Hanson (1984), the family's role can be assessed by observing the communication patterns in the family. Assessment should include how decisions are reached, the roles and communication patterns of the members, how role changes are tolerated, and the effectiveness of communication (Hanson, 1984). For example, when a couple adjusts their lifestyle appropriately following retirement from full-time employment, they are adapting in this mode.\n\nThe need for social integrity is also emphasized in the interdependence mode. Interdependence involves maintaining a balance between independence and dependence in one's relationships with others. Dependent behaviors include affection seeking, help seeking, and attention seeking. Independent behaviors include mastery of obstacles and initiative taking. According to Hanson (1984), when assessing this mode in families, the nurse tries to determine how successfully the family lives within a given community. The nurse would assess the interactions of the family with the neighbors and other community groups, the support systems of the family, and the significant others (Hanson, 1984).\n\nThe goal of nursing is to promote adaptation of the client during both health and illness in all four of the modes. Actions of the nurse begin with the assessment process, The family is assessed on two levels. First, the nurse makes a judgment with regard to the presence or absence of maladaptation. Then, the nurse focuses the assessment on the stimuli influencing the family's maladaptive behaviors. The nurse may need to manipulate the environment, an element or elements of the client system, or both in order to promote adaptation.\n\nMany nurses, as well as schools of nursing, have adopted the Roy adaptation model as a framework for nursing practice. The model views the client in a holistic manner and contributes significantly to nursing knowledge. The model continues to undergo clarification and development by the author.\n\nWhen using Roy's model as a theoretical framework, the following can serve as a guide for the assessment of families.\n\nThe nurse assesses the degree to which the family's actions in each mode are leading to positive coping and adaptation to the focal stimuli. If coping and adaptation are not health promoting, assessment of the types of stimuli and the effectiveness of the regulators provides the basis for the design of nursing interventions to promote adaptation.\n\nBy answering each of these questions in each assessment, a nurse can have a full understanding of the problem's a patient may be having. It is important to recognize each stimuli because without it, not every aspect of the person's problem can be confronted and fixed. As a nurse, it is their job to recognize all of these modes, mechanisms, and stimuli while taking care of a patient. They do so through the use of their advanced knowledge of the nursing process as well as with interviews with the individuals and the family members.\n\nCallista Roy maintains there are four main adaptation systems, which she calls modes of adaptation. She calls these the\n1. the physiological - physical system\n2. the self-concept group identity system\n3. the role mastery/function system\n4. the interdependency system.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2286032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2286032", "title": "Marion Bartoli", "text": "Marion Bartoli\n\nMarion Bartoli (; born 2 October 1984) is a French former professional tennis player. She won the 2013 Wimbledon Championships singles title after previously being runner-up in 2007, and was a semifinalist at the 2011 French Open. She also won eight Women's Tennis Association singles and three doubles titles. She announced her immediate retirement from professional tennis on 14 August 2013.\n\nBartoli defeated three reigning world No. 1 players in her career: Justine Henin in the semifinal of the 2007 Wimbledon Championships, Jelena Janković in the fourth round of the 2009 Australian Open, and Victoria Azarenka in the quarterfinals of the 2012 Sony Ericsson Open. She also recorded wins over other top players such as Venus and Serena Williams, Ana Ivanovic, Lindsay Davenport, Arantxa Sánchez Vicario, Dinara Safina, Caroline Wozniacki, Petra Kvitová, Samantha Stosur, and Kim Clijsters.\n\nShe is known for her unorthodox style of play using two hands on both her forehand and backhand. On 30 January 2012 she reached a career-high ranking of No. 7 in the world; she returned to this ranking on 8 July 2013 after triumphing at Wimbledon. Bartoli reached at least the quarterfinal stage at each of the four Grand Slams. Her win at Wimbledon made her only the sixth player in the open era to win the Championships without dropping a single set. She is also one of only three players ever to have played at both the WTA Tour Championships and the WTA Tournament of Champions (later renamed the WTA Elite Trophy) in the same year (2011); the other two being Kiki Bertens and Sofia Kenin.\n\nMarion Bartoli was born on 2 October 1984 in Le Puy-en-Velay, Haute-Loire. She is of Corsican descent; her family is from Palneca, Corse-du-Sud.\n\nBartoli was introduced to tennis by her medical doctor father, Walter, when she was six years old. She would practice tennis with him late at night after school on small, icy, unevenly surfaced courts which restricted free movement and influenced her playing style. When weather was sufficiently bad, they would train in an old indoor facility where there was very limited room between baseline and the wall, meaning Bartoli became adept at playing inside the baseline. He devised original training methods, such as improving hand-eye coordination by using balls of different size and color, or encouraging Marion to stay on her toes by taping tennis balls to the heels of her shoes. He drove hundreds of kilometres to tournaments while she would do her homework in the back of the car.\n\nIn 2019, Bartoli married Belgian football player Yahya Boumedine. She announced in May 2020 that she was pregnant with the couple's first child.\n\nBartoli was known for her unorthodox and intense style of play on the court. She used two hands on both the forehand and the backhand, and was generally classed as an aggressive and hard-hitting player who played primarily from the baseline. She developed her two-handed style on the advice of her father and longtime coach, Walter Bartoli. He had seen the classic 1992 French Open final in which Monica Seles defeated Steffi Graf, and immediately was inspired to teach Seles' technique to his daughter. Bartoli had previously had trouble with her forehand, but it improved significantly when she made the switch to two hands. Her game was based on power and she used her double-fisted strokes to create sharp angles to open up the court and preferred to take the ball very early on groundstrokes. Her serve was considered a weakness but her return of serve was considered to be her biggest weapon and she often stood well inside the baseline to receive serve, even on first serves, and managed to take advantage of break point opportunities. Bartoli was not a \"natural athlete\" so she was not a strong mover around the court and instead relied on her excellent hand-eye coordination and anticipation skills.\n\nHer style of play could be most closely compared to that of Seles, who had a strong influence on Bartoli as a young player. In a TV interview during the 2012 US Open tournament, Bartoli explained that both Seles and she are left-handed, and that she had a very weak forehand before changing to two hands.\n\nBartoli was not a very good mover on court, a state exacerbated by her two-fisted strokes, which made her vulnerable to fast all-court players such as Agnieszka Radwańska (whom she never beat). Bartoli did however work on her fitness and mobility throughout her career to varying success.\n\nBartoli was also known for her unusual serve, in which she used her wrist to generate speed. She also changed her service motion many times over the years. During the 2013 Wimbledon Championships, she had an unusual setup for serves – no ball-bouncing, arms crossed, right wrist resting on her left thumb before the toss.\n\nBartoli manifested unusual on-court mannerisms, such as energetically bouncing on the spot and practising racquet swings between points, and being noticeably restless during changeovers. She claimed that this was to maintain the focus needed for her intense style of play.\n\nBartoli's father, who had no background in tennis, had years earlier retired from his career as a medical doctor to learn how to become a tennis coach and coach her to become a professional tennis player.\nBartoli has denied allegations that her close relationship with her father is a public show to hide a dominating parent. She has resisted pressure to play without him, including giving up the chance to play at the Olympics in London in 2012 because she would not play in the Fed Cup without his private coaching. In February 2013 Bartoli announced that the coaching setup with her father, who had been her coach throughout her tennis career, had come to an end by mutual agreement, and stated that she would be working with physical trainer Nicolas Perrotte and former player Gabriel Urpí until she found a new coach who could take her to the next level and help her win her first Grand Slam singles title. The following month it was announced on the WTA website that Bartoli was being coached by Jana Novotná, but they cancelled the coaching arrangement after a week with the conclusion of the Indian Wells Masters tournament. Bartoli was subsequently coached by the former World No. 1 Amélie Mauresmo, under whom she won the 2013 Wimbledon Championships.\n\nBartoli retired whilst using the Prince EXO 3 Warrior racquet. She had previously used the Prince EXO3 Black and the Prince O3 Red. All her Prince racquets were specially modified in New York to make them longer by 2.0 inches (to 29 inches) than standard racquets to give her better reach with her two-handed strokes. She started using the 29-inch frames in 2006 and soon won her first tournament in Auckland. For many years she had no clothing sponsor, but wore Nike. In October 2011, she signed a three-year clothing deal with Lotto. Before her breakthrough into the top 100, Bartoli was playing with a standard length Babolat racquet and she was wearing Le Coq Sportif apparel. Due to her small hands, her racquets had a very small grip size of 0.\n\nBartoli started entering tournaments regularly at the age of 16. After a few aborted starts in 1999 and 2000, she played in the $10,000 clay events in the spring of 2001. Winning two tournaments back to back in May (in Hatfield and Torino) ensured that she would be given a wildcard into her first Grand Slam, the French Open, where she lost to Catalina Castaño in the first round. Bartoli also won another tournament in Koksijde, Belgium.\n\nIn 2002, she received a wildcard into the Australian Open. She lost to Tina Pisnik in three sets. She then won her fourth ITF title in Columbus, Ohio. She followed that with a first-round exit at the French Open, losing in three sets to Ai Sugiyama. In the US Open where she qualified, she defeated Arantxa Sánchez Vicario, which was Bartoli's first win over a player in the top 100. She followed that with a win over Rossana de los Ríos, before losing to fourth seed Lindsay Davenport.\n\nBartoli began 2003 by coming through the qualifying draw in the Canberra Women's Classic to reach her first WTA semifinal, where she lost to Francesca Schiavone. At the Australian Open, where she earned her place in a Grand Slam through her ranking for the first time, she lost to 11th seed Magdalena Maleeva in the first round. She qualified for Key Biscayne and made it to the quarterfinals, after Lindsay Davenport retired in their fourth-round match due to injury. In the quarterfinal she lost to Serena Williams.\n\nIn the Internationaux de Strasbourg Bartoli reached the quarterfinals, where she lost to Vera Zvonareva. At the French Open, she earned another victory over Rossana de los Ríos, but lost to Jennifer Capriati in the second round. At her first Wimbledon, she drew the ninth seed Daniela Hantuchová in the first round, and lost.\n\nAt the Acura Classic, Bartoli defeated her first top-20 player, Meghann Shaughnessy, before losing to Kim Clijsters in the third round. At the US Open she lost to Hantuchová in the first round. But in doubles, she reached her first and only semifinal of doubles at Grand Slams. At the end of the year, she reached the quarterfinals of Bell Challenge, losing to Milagros Sequera.\n\nBartoli began the season by getting to her first WTA semifinal in the season-opener in Auckland. She then got to the second round of the Australian Open for the first time, losing to 22nd-seeded Patty Schnyder.\n\nIn February Bartoli played at the Hyderabad Open, where she defeated Ankita Bhambri, Galina Fokina, and Mervana Jugić-Salkić to reach the semifinals, before losing to eventual champion Nicole Pratt. This performance briefly made her a top-50 player.\n\nBartoli refound her doubles form of late 2003. Partnering compatriot Émilie Loit, she reached the semifinals of Acapulco, the quarterfinals of Indian Wells, and then Bartoli won her first WTA doubles title in Casablanca.\n\nAfter a forgettable singles clay-court season (culminating in her second loss to Sugiyama at her native Grand Slam event), she climbed back up the rankings by reaching the third round of Wimbledon (losing to Sugiyama for the second successive Grand Slam). She also got to the quarterfinals of Wimbledon in doubles, partnering Loit for the second successive Grand Slam (they had failed to get beyond the second round of the French Open). Bartoli got to her third singles semifinal of the year in Cincinnati, before pulling out of her match with Lindsay Davenport with a blister on her right hand. She reached the second round of the US Open, despite being drawn against 32nd-seeded Meghann Shaughnessy in the first round. She lost to Russian Vera Dushevina in the second round.\n\nIn the absence of Amélie Mauresmo and Mary Pierce due to injuries, Bartoli received her debut Fed Cup call-up for France's semifinals against Spain. She was teamed with Loit again and helped complete a 5–0 whitewash of the Spanish team. In the final against Russia, Bartoli's and Loit's doubles match against Myskina and Vera Zvonareva was the decisive rubber. The Russian pair won, earning the Fed Cup for Russia for the first time. As a result, Bartoli's team leader Guy Forget resigned, and she was not chosen by the new team leader Georges Goven to play in 2005.\n\nShe ended 2004 ranked world No. 41, having gone 30–24 over the year. Her hard-court record was 23–13, with clay going 4–7, grass 3–3, and carpet 0–1.\n\nAfter a promising start (semifinals in Auckland and quarterfinals in Canberra), which took her to world No. 32 and winning the second doubles tournament of her career in Pattaya City, injury disrupted the second quarter of 2005. The only match Bartoli played in the clay-court season was her straight-sets first-round loss to Shahar Pe'er at the French Open (where she was seeded for the first time, 28th). Her quarterfinal run at Eastbourne (where she had to retire hurt) led her to a career-high ranking of No. 27 at the start of Wimbledon, where she lost to Jill Craybas in the second round.\n\nHighlights of the year were reaching the third round of the US Open for the second time (losing to Sania Mirza) and making her second WTA semifinal of the year (and fifth of her career) in Québec.\n\nHer end-of-season statistics were 35–26, albeit padded by a victory in a satellite tournament in Doha at the end of the year. She went 30–21 on hard courts, 0–1 on clay, 3–3 on grass, and 2–1 on carpet. She was now ranked world No. 40.\n\nIn January 2006, Bartoli at 21 years of age won her first senior title at the ASB Classic in Auckland, New Zealand, beating Vera Zvonareva in the final. She then lost in the second round of the first three Grand Slam events of the year (losing to Roberta Vinci in Australia, Jelena Janković at the French Open, and Karolina Šprem at Wimbledon, all in three sets), but she won her third career doubles title by capturing the ECM Prague Open with Shahar Pe'er in May.\n\nThe North American summer hard-court season was very productive for Bartoli, as she reached the third round (and in some cases that meant the quarterfinals) of five of the seven tournaments she entered, including the US Open, where she again lost in the third round, this time to seventh-seeded Patty Schnyder. The following week she beat Schnyder en route to her second final of the year in Bali, where she lost to world No. 5 Svetlana Kuznetsova.\n\nIn October Bartoli won her second WTA singles title at the AIG Japan Open Tennis Championships, beating Aiko Nakamura in the final. This was the first ever WTA final contested by two players using two-handed strokes on both the forehand and backhand. As a result of winning the title, Bartoli broke into the top 20 for the first time. In her last event of the year, she captured the Bell Challenge in Québec, defeating Olga Puchkova without losing a game in the final.\n\nBartoli finished the year ranked world no. 17. Her record was 45–28, her best on tour so far. That consisted of 37–17 on hard courts, 4–6 on clay, 3–3 on grass, and 1–2 on carpet. She was 3–6 against top-10 players.\n\nBartoli began 2007 with another second-round exit at the Australian Open, this time falling to Victoria Azarenka. In the clay-court season, she reached the final of the ECM Prague Open in May, losing to Akiko Morigami. After reaching the semifinals in Strasbourg, she lost to Amélie Mauresmo. Bartoli reached her first career Grand Slam fourth round at the French Open by defeating Aravane Rezaï, Andrea Petkovic, and 13th seed Elena Dementieva. In the fourth round, she was knocked out by fourth seed Jelena Janković, though Bartoli injured her back during this match. In the grass-court season, she reached the semifinals at Birmingham, where she lost to Maria Sharapova. She also reached the semifinals at Eastbourne, but lost to world No. 1 Justine Henin.\n\nAt Wimbledon, Bartoli advanced to her first Grand Slam final, after defeating top-seeded Justine Henin in the semi-final. Bartoli lost the first set, and claimed afterwards that the reason for her turnaround in the match was seeing Pierce Brosnan in the royal box and being determined to play well in front of one of her favourite actors. In the final, Bartoli lost to the three-time former champion Venus Williams, but rose to a career high of No. 11 in the WTA rankings. At the US Open, Bartoli reached the fourth round for the first time by defeating the world No. 25 Lucie Šafářová, but lost to Serena Williams. At the Fortis Championships in Luxembourg, she reached her first semi-final since her Wimbledon run, but then lost to Daniela Hantuchová.\n\nAt the Tier I event in Zurich Bartoli reached the quarter-finals, where she retired due to injury against Tatiana Golovin. Despite her injury, Bartoli played at the Generali Ladies Linz in Austria, and reached the semi-finals, where she was defeated by Patty Schnyder. This ended her hopes of reaching the WTA Tour Championships. However, after Serena Williams withdrew, Bartoli entered the event and played in the yellow group, where she lost to Justine Henin without winning a game, but defeated Jelena Janković after the Serbian retired. Her final record for the year was 47–31, with 19–16 on hard courts, 14–7 on clay, 12–3 on grass, and 2–5 on carpet. Her record against top-10 players was 4–8.

{"id": "2286045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2286045", "title": "Nash–Moser theorem", "text": "Nash–Moser theorem\n\nIn the mathematical field of analysis, the Nash–Moser theorem, discovered by mathematician John Forbes Nash and named for him and Jürgen Moser, is a generalization of the inverse function theorem on Banach spaces to settings when the required solution mapping for the linearized problem is not bounded.\nIn contrast to the Banach space case, in which the invertibility of the derivative at a point is sufficient for a map to be locally invertible, the Nash–Moser theorem requires the derivative to be invertible in a neighborhood. The theorem is widely used to prove local existence for non-linear partial differential equations in spaces of smooth functions. It is particularly useful when the inverse to the derivative \"loses\" derivatives, and therefore the Banach space implicit function theorem cannot be used.\n\nThe Nash-Moser theorem traces back to , which proved the theorem in the special case of the isometric embedding problem. It is clear from his paper that his method can be generalized. , for instance, showed that Nash's methods could be successfully applied to solve problems on periodic orbits in celestial mechanics in the KAM theory. However, it has proven quite difficult to find a suitable general formulation; there is, to date, no all-encompassing version; various versions due to Gromov, Hamilton, Hörmander, Moser, Saint-Raymond, Schwartz, and Sergeraert are given in the references below. That of Hamilton's, quoted below, is particularly widely cited.\n\nThis will be introduced in the original setting of the Nash-Moser theorem, that of the isometric embedding problem. Let formula_1 be an open subset of formula_2 Consider the map\ngiven by\nIn Nash's solution of the isometric embedding problem (as would be expected in the solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations) a major step is a statement of the schematic form \"If \"f\" is such that \"P\"(\"f\") is positive-definite, then for any matrix-valued function \"g\" which is close to \"P\"(\"f\"), there exists \"f\" with \"P\"(\"f\")=\"g\".\"\n\nFollowing standard practice, one would expect to apply the Banach space inverse function theorem. So, for instance, one might expect to restrict \"P\" to \"C\"(Ω;ℝ) and, for an immersion \"f\" in this domain, to study the linearization \"C\"(Ω;ℝ)→\"C\"(Ω;Sym(ℝ)) given by\nIf one could show that this were invertible, with bounded inverse, then the Banach space inverse function theorem directly applies.\n\nHowever, there is a deep reason that such a formulation cannot work. The issue is that there is a second-order differential operator of \"P\"(\"f\") which coincides with a second-order differential operator applied to \"f\". To be precise: if \"f\" is an immersion then\nwhere \"R\" is the scalar curvature of the Riemannian metric \"P\"(\"f\"), \"H\"(\"f\") denotes the mean curvature of the immersion \"f\", and \"h\"(\"f\") denotes its second fundamental form; the above equation is the Gauss equation from surface theory. So, if \"P\"(\"f\") is \"C\", then \"R\" is generally only \"C\". Then, according to the above equation, \"f\" can generally be only \"C\"; if it were \"C\" then |\"H\"|-|\"h\"| would have to be at least \"C\". The source of the problem can be quite succinctly phrased in the following way: the Gauss equation shows that there is a differential operator \"Q\" such that the order of the composition of \"Q\" with \"P\" is less than the sum of the orders of \"P\" and \"Q\".\n\nIn context, the upshot is that the inverse to the linearization of \"P\", even if it exists as a map \"C\"(Ω;Sym(ℝ))→\"C\"(Ω;ℝ), cannot be bounded between appropriate Banach spaces, and hence the Banach space implicit function theorem cannot be applied.\n\nBy exactly the same reasoning, one cannot directly apply the Banach space implicit function theorem even if one uses the Hölder spaces, the Sobolev spaces, or any of the \"C\" spaces. In any of these settings, an inverse to the linearization of \"P\" will fail to be bounded.\n\nThis is the problem of loss of derivatives. A very naive expectation is that, generally, if \"P\" is an order \"k\" differential operator, then if \"P\"(\"f\") is in \"C\" then \"f\" must be in \"C\". However, this is somewhat rare. In the case of uniformly elliptic differential operatrs, the famous Schauder estimates show that this naive expectation is borne out, with the caveat that one must replace the \"C\" spaces with the Hölder spaces \"C\"; this causes no extra difficulty whatsoever for the application of the Banach space implicit function theorem. However, the above analysis shows that this naive expectation is \"not\" borne out for the map which sends an immersion to its induced Riemannian metric; given that this map is of order 1, one does not gain the \"expected\" one derivative upon inverting the operator. The same failure is common in geometric problems, where the action of the diffeomorphism group is the root cause, and in problems of hyperbolic differential equations, where even in the very simplest problems one does not have the naively expected smoothness of a solution. All of these difficulties provide common contexts for applications of the Nash-Moser theorem.\n\nThis section only aims to describe an idea, and as such it is intentionally imprecise. For concreteness, suppose that \"P\" is an order-one differential operator on some function spaces, so that it defines a map \"P\":\"C\"→\"C\" for each \"k\". Suppose that, at some \"C\" function \"f\", the linearization \"DP\":\"C\"→\"C\" has a right inverse \"S\":\"C\"→\"C\"; in the above language this reflects a \"loss of one derivative\". One can concretely see the failure of trying to use Newton's method to prove the Banach space implicit function theorem in this context: if \"g\" is close to \"P\"(\"f\") in \"C\" and one defines the iteration\nthen \"f\"∈\"C\" implies that \"g\"-\"P\"(\"f\") is in \"C\", and then \"f\" is in \"C\". By the same reasoning, \"f\" is in \"C\", and \"f\" is in \"C\", and so on. In finitely many steps the iteration must end, since it will lose all regularity and the next step will not even be defined.\n\nNash's solution is quite striking in its simplicity. Suppose that for each \"t\">0 one has a smoothing operator θ which takes a \"C\" function, returns a smooth function, and approximates the identity when \"t\" is large. Then the \"smoothed\" Newton iteration\ntransparently does not encounter the same difficulty as the previous \"unsmoothed\" version, since it is an iteration in the space of smooth functions which never loses regularity. So one has a well-defined sequence of functions; the major surprise of Nash's approach is that this sequence actually converges to a function \"f\" with \"P\"(\"f\")=\"g\". For many mathematicians, this is rather surprising, since the \"fix\" of throwing in a smoothing operator seems too superficial to overcome the deep problem in the standard Newton method. For instance, on this point Mikhael Gromov says\nRemark. The true \"smoothed Newton iteration\" is a little more complicated than the above form, although there are a few inequivalent forms, depending on where one chooses to insert the smoothing operators. The primary difference is that one requires invertibility of \"DP\" for an entire open neighborhood of choices of \"f\", and then one uses the \"true\" Newton iteration, corresponding to (using single-variable notation)\nas opposed to\nthe latter of which reflects the forms given above. This is rather important, since the improved quadratic convergence of the \"true\" Newton iteration is significantly used to combat the error of \"smoothing,\" in order to obtain convergence. Certain approaches, in particular Nash's and Hamilton's, follow the solution of an ordinary differential equation in function space rather than an iteration in function space; the relation of the latter to the former is essentially that of the solution of Euler's method to that of a differential equation.\n\nThe following statement appears in :\nSimilarly, if each linearization is only injective, and a family of left inverses is smooth tame, then \"P\" is locally injective. And if each linearization is only surjective, and a family of right inverses is smooth tame, then \"P\" is locally surjective with a smooth tame right inverse.\nA graded Fréchet space consists of the following data:\nSuch a graded Fréchet space is called tame if it satisfies the following condition:\nHere Σ(\"B\") denotes the vector space of exponentially decreasing sequences in \"B\", i.e.\nThe laboriousness of the definition is justified by the primary examples of tamely graded Fréchet spaces:\nTo recognize the tame structure of these examples, one topologically embeds \"M\" in a Euclidean space, \"B\" is taken to be the space of \"L\" functions on this Euclidean space, and the map \"L\" is defined by dyadic restriction of the Fourier transform. The details are in pages 133-140 of Hamilton's article.\n\nPresented directly as above, the meaning and naturality of the \"tame\" condition is rather obscure. The situation is clarified if one re-considers the basic examples given above, in which the relevant \"exponentially decreasing\" sequences in Banach spaces arise from restriction of a Fourier transform. Recall that smoothness of a function on Euclidean space is directly related to the rate of decay of its Fourier transform. \"Tameness\" is thus seen as a condition which is allows an abstraction of the idea of a \"smoothing operator\" on a function space. Given a Banach space \"B\" and the corresponding space Σ(\"B\") of exponentially decreasing sequences in \"B\", the precise analogue of a smoothing operator can be defined in the following way. Let \"s\":ℝ→ℝ be a smooth function which vanishes on (-∞,0), is identically equal to one on (1,∞), and takes values only in the interval [0,1]. Then for each real number \"t\" define θ:Σ(\"B\")→Σ(\"B\") by\nIf one accepts the schematic idea of the proof devised by Nash, and in particular his use of smoothing operators, the \"tame\" condition then becomes rather reasonable.\n\nLet \"F\" and \"G\" be graded Fréchet spaces. Let \"U\" be an open subset of \"F\", meaning that for each \"f\" in \"U\" there is \"n\" and ε>0 such that ||\"f\"||<ε implies that \"f\" is also contained in \"U\".\n\nLet \"P\":\"U\"→\"G\" be a smooth map. One says that it is tame if for all \"k\"∈ℕ the derivative \"D\"\"P\":\"U\"×\"F\"×⋅⋅⋅×\"F\"→\"G\" satisfies the following:\n\nThe fundamental example says that, on a compact smooth manifold, a nonlinear partial differential operator (possibly between sections of vector bundles over the manifold) is a smooth tame map; in this case, \"r\" can be taken to be the order of the operator.\n\nLet \"S\" denote the family of inverse mappings \"U\"×\"G\"→\"F\". Consider the special case that \"F\" and \"G\" are spaces of exponentially decreasing sequences in Banach spaces, i.e. \"F\"=Σ(\"B\") and \"G\"=Σ(\"C\"). (It is not too difficult to see that this is sufficient to prove the general case.) For a positive number \"c\", consider the ordinary differential equation in Σ(\"B\") given by\nHamilton shows that if \"P\"(0)=0 and \"g\" is sufficiently small in Σ(\"C\"), then the solution of this differential equation with initial condition \"f\"(0)=0 exists as a mapping [0,∞)→Σ(\"B\"), and that \"f\"(\"t\") converges as \"t\"→∞ to a solution of \"P\"(f)=\"g\".\n\n"}

It is situated on the Gilbert River, from which the town derives its name. Both the Gilbert Valley and Gilbert River were named after South Australian pioneer, Thomas Gilbert. Riverton was first settled in 1856, as a settlement along the bullock track from the mining town of Burra to the capital city Adelaide. It grew from a plan designed by a James Masters who had established the nearby town of Saddleworth. The streets of Riverton received their names chiefly from James Masters and his friends. They commemorate persons notable in the history of the district or the State. At the , Riverton had a population of 810. Including the rural areas surrounding the town, the population was 1213.\n\nThe first storekeeper in the town, John Jubb Horner, arrived in South Australia in 1853 and soon made his way with his family to Riverton. His store, built in the early 1850s, was situated at the south end of the town. His store was the commercial emporium of Riverton, where the settlers would gather for social purposes as well as business. This store was also the original Post Office, Telegraph Office, and registry for births, deaths and marriages. The only other shop in the town in the early 1850s was owned by a cobbler, Mister Payne.\n\nThe Riverton Hotel, originally known as the Riverton Arms, opened for business in 1855, although the building was not completed until 1857. This hotel, and the abovemention two shops, were the only business places in 1857.\n\nLocal Government was proclaimed in July 1866, the first Court House and Police Station were opened that same year, the new Post Office and the Community Hall were both built in 1874.\n\nIn 1897, it was reported that miners were engaged in opening up a mineral show in the hills about 5 miles (8 km) east of Riverton, resulting in what appeared to be a permanent lode of copper and silver lead. Samples were sent for assaying and the results were promising, silver and lead definitely being present. However no developments took place, which indicates that the lode could not have been as extensive as appeared at first. Even by 1965, fossickers still gleaned a little from this mineral deposit.\n\nThe transport problems for the Kapunda miners were eased in 1860 when the railway reached there. The question was whether the line should continue from Kapunda northwards along the valley of the River Light to Burra, or whether another line should stretch northwards from Gawler through the Gilbert Valley. The authorities decided on the latter route because it would open up thousands of acres of good agricultural land, encouraging the establishment of new towns along the route.\n\nThat was a fortunate decision for Riverton. The Peterborough railway line was opened to Tarlee in 1868, Riverton on 20 December 1869 and Manoora in 1870.\n\nRailway workshops were immediately set up in Riverton. This swelled the population and sharply increased trade generally in the town. However, the workshops closed in 1878.\nIn 1918, the branch line to Clare was opened, which later extended to Spalding. This branch made it necessary for more railway employees to live at Riverton. In 1965, there were 25 railway employees and their families living there.\n\nRiverton station was the scene of an attempted mass shooting in 1921. A passenger who was travelling on the Broken Hill Express from Adelaide fired a number of shots into the dining room, and Percy Brookfield, the Member of Parliament for Broken Hill, was shot and killed when he tried to disarm the gunman.\n\nThe massive buildings were the finest outside Adelaide, with the refreshment rooms being open for all passenger trains. At one time, passenger trains passing through Riverton had connections at Terowie to Broken Hill, Alice Springs and Perth. The refreshment rooms served a three-course dinner to east–west passengers and breakfast to Broken Hill passengers.\n\nThe station building now houses tea-rooms, a gallery and bed and breakfast accommodation. Renovated, ensuite railway carriages provide unusual accommodation.\n\nThe railways played a major part in the development of Riverton, both as a transport provider and as an employer. Today, the route of railway line from Riverton to Auburn has been converted into a walking/cycle rail trail, known as the Rattler Trail. The Rattler Trail joins the Riesling Trail at Auburn, providing a 43 km route from Riverton, through the heart of the Clare Valley wine region to the North. The Peterbrough railway line is also closed, although no rail trail has been created.\n\nRiverton was home to the \"Mid-North Courier\", a newspaper printed between 5 January 1928 and 24 June 1942. It was available in Riverton, Saddleworth, Tarlee, Manoora, Marrabel and Rhynie.\n\nIt was also home to a newspaper called the \"Gilbert Valley News\" (1 July 1965 - 27 July 1967). The distribution of the publication included: Riverton, Saddleworth, Manoora, Tarlee, Marrabel, Rhynie, Waterloo, Stockport and Black Springs. In August 1967, the newspaper merged with Hamley Bridge's \"Junction News and Owen Post\" (10 May 1946 – 28 July 1967) to form the \"Junction and Gilbert Valley News\" (4 August 1967 - 30 January 1969). This combined newspaper was then merged into \"The Bunyip\", located in Gawler.\n\nRiverton is in the District Council of Clare and Gilbert Valleys local government area, the state electoral district of Frome and the federal Division of Grey.\n\nLiberal politicians Clive Hannaford and Trish Worth were born in Riverton.\n\n"}

At age 17, after leaving a Swiss finishing school, she started working at her father's bookshop, and never left. The store, Foyles, on Charing Cross Road in the West End of London, had been started in 1904 by her father, William Foyle. She fiercely resisted unionisation of bookshop staff, sacking most employees just before they had worked there six months, when they would gain limited job protection rights. In the late 1930s, she founded the Right Book Club to counter what she regarded as the pernicious influence of Victor Gollancz's Left Book Club. It offered a variety of titles with Conservative and classical Liberal themes.\n\nIn 1945, control of the shop passed to her. It was under her that the shop stagnated, with little investment and poorly paid staff who could be fired on a whim. She refused to install any modern conveniences such as electronic tills or calculators, nor would orders be taken by phone. However, the shop excelled in other fields: expensive books ordered from as far off as Germany were sent with a bill without prepayment.\n\nThe shop operated a payment system that required customers to queue three times: to collect an invoice for a book, to pay the invoice, then to collect the book, simply because sales staff were not allowed to handle cash. Equally mystifying to customers was a shelving arrangement that categorised books by publisher, rather than by topic or author. A quote of this period is: \"Imagine Kafka had gone into the book trade.\" In the 1980s a rival bookshop placed an advertisement in a bus shelter opposite Foyles: \"\"Foyled again? Try Dillons\"\".\n\nFor 70 years she presided over Foyles lunches. Her idea for bringing readers, writers and thinkers together came after she recommended \"The Forsyte Saga\" to an elderly customer who was looking for something to read on the train. The gentleman bought a copy. However he returned it to her a short time later with the words \"For the young lady who liked my book – John Galsworthy.\"\n\nFoyle met many leading literary and political figures during her life. Her collection of personal correspondence included a letter from Adolf Hitler, responding to her complaint about Nazi book-burning. Her literary friends included Kingsley Amis, Charles de Gaulle, D. H. Lawrence, Yehudi Menuhin, J. B. Priestley, George Bernard Shaw, Margaret Thatcher, Evelyn Waugh and H. G. Wells.\n\nFoyle was the niece of Charles Henry Foyle, inventor of the \"folding carton\" and founder of Boxfoldia. Screenwriter Anthony Horowitz has said that Miss Foyle was the namesake for the title character, Christopher Foyle, in the ITV series \"Foyle's War\".\n\nThe Foyle Foundation was founded in 2001 under the terms of Christina Foyle's will. It makes grants to other UK charities, mainly in the fields of the arts and learning (until 2009, also health). The 2010 accounts showed funds of over £76 million. Among other grants it made a large donation to the appeal to purchase the oldest intact European book, the St Cuthbert Gospel, for the British Library in 2011/12. To the year ending June 2010 £41.4m worth of grants had been offered by the Foyle Foundation.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2286095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2286095", "title": "Langley Mill Pottery", "text": "Langley Mill Pottery\n\nLangley Mill Pottery was located in Langley Mill, Derbyshire on the Derbyshire – Nottinghamshire border. From its establishment in 1865 to its final closure in 1982, the pottery went through five distinct periods of ownership, producing a wide range of stoneware ranging from salt glazed ink bottles, utilitarian items and tableware to high quality and original art pottery.\n\nIn 1865, James Calvert, a chemist and druggist from Belper, Derbyshire, established the Langley Mill pottery on the site of a former brick-works. The company was known at that time as James Calvert. Historically, this area was already one of the major producers of stoneware pottery due to its location over the Derbyshire – Nottinghamshire Coal Field and several other stoneware potteries were already operational at that time. The local Coal Measures, as well as providing a ready source of fuel, were often associated with deposits of reddish clay, which proved to be highly suitable for the production of stoneware. It is therefore likely that Calvert chose the site for the new pottery with this in mind, although the close proximity of the Midland Railway and the Erewash Canal also afforded the prospect of excellent transport links.\n\nIn the 1870s, James Calvert entered into a short lived partnership with another Belper chemist and druggist, William Peter Adshead, to form Calvert & Adshead. Around 1880, after an unsuccessful attempt to sell the business, James Calvert went into partnership with his son, William Henry Calvert, the pottery then being called J. Calvert & Son.\n\nThe initial products of the pottery were items such as salt glazed inkpots, ginger beer bottles, polish pots, pitchers, jugs and mugs etc. These items were produced both for Calvert's own chemist and druggist business as well as being supplied to other similar businesses.\n\nIn 1883, Albert Lovatt and his brother, John Lovatt entered into partnership with William Calvert and the pottery's name was changed to Calvert and Lovatt. Both Lovatt brothers were born in Belper, Derbyshire and had previously been employed as potters at the nearby and larger Denby Pottery, operated by Joseph Bourne & Son.\n\nThe new partnership at Langley Mill resulted in the development and introduction of new ranges of art wares. These were designed and decorated by artists employed by the pottery such as Mary Helen Goodyer (c1856–1941), George Leighton Parkinson (1864–1938) and William Calvert's second daughter, Eleanor \"Daisy\" Calvert (1874–1925). In 1895 William Calvert left the pottery, dissolving his partnership with the Lovatt brothers and effectively ending the production of art ware pottery at Langley Mill. The detailed reasons for his departure are not known, but the general difficulties experienced by the pottery industry during the 1890s and the possible disappointing profitability of the Langley art ware due to its relatively high production costs, may have been significant factors. After Calvert's departure, the company was renamed Lovatt & Lovatt.\n\nThe output during this period was perhaps the most accomplished to come out of the pottery at any period and included a great variety of vases, bowls, jardinières, fern pots, pot pourri and other similar decorative items - as well as the usual domestic and utilitarian items. Typical decoration of art ware pieces at this time by Helen Goodyer consisted of intricate incised designs, usually with a botanical theme, executed through one or more layers of previously applied coloured slip. George Leighton Parkinson designs also utilised incised patterns, often in conjunction with painted scenes. Typically the subjects of these miniature painted scenes were English pastoral scenes or various famous landmarks, such as the ruins of Tintern Abbey. Often, gilding was also applied to the incised designs.\n\nArt Wares produced at this time were usually marked on the base with an impressed \"Langley Ware\" mark, in a variety of designs. Occasionally, the artist concerned would also monogram some of the higher quality pieces. However, many pieces which were produced at Langley Mill seem to have no marks at all.\n\nThe period from the turn of the 19th century to the end of World War I (1914–1918) was a period of unparalleled prosperity, innovation and expansion for the Langley Mill Pottery, with the proprietors becoming increasingly affluent and influential. In 1913, following Albert Lovatt's death, the pottery was converted into a private limited company, Lovatt & Lovatt Ltd. with John Lovatt and Bert Lovatt (Albert's second son) as joint Chairman and Managing Director. Reginald, (Albert's third son) also joined the management of the company around this time. Unfortunately, after 1918, the post-war depression began to seriously affect the profitability of the pottery, a situation not helped by a period of apparently weak management.\n\nBy 1923, the profitability of the pottery had declined significantly further, with the Directors being forced to take large cuts in their salaries. Finally, following the death of John Lovatt the previous year, the company went into voluntary liquidation on 18 July 1930. This ended the involvement of the Lovatt family in the affairs of the Langley Mill Pottery, although the Lovatt name did continue to be used by successive owners of the business.\n\nDespite the departure of Calvert, the cessation in the production of art ware proved to be only temporary and by the end of 1896, George Leighton Parkinson rejoined the company to head the Art Department. Art ware was always produced alongside the output of more mundane items and never constituted a major proportion of the pottery's output. In 1897, the production of decorated stoneware vases, pots and other items began again, although the output was not as fine as during the Calvert & Lovatt period as the emphasis was now on ease of production. Several ingenious methods to reduce production costs which did not result in a fall in quality were introduced, particularly in the area of decoration, resulting in the granting of Patent No. 8687 to the pottery in 1908. By 1905, lead had also been eliminated from the glazes used.\n\nExamples of wares from this period are Mycovera Ware, Applique Ware and Lovique Ware. By 1903, the New Art Ware was in production, consisting of hand-painted impasto flowers on a matt glaze background. The years between 1903 and 1909 also saw the introduction of additional domestic wares including Daisy Ware, Princess Ware, Green Fireproof Ware, Myrtle Ware, Royal Blue Ware and Osborne Ware.\n\nIn 1931, the Pottery was acquired as a subsidiary of James Oakes & Co. (Riddings) Ltd. and renamed Lovatts Potteries Ltd. One of the first actions of the new ownership was to introduce a substantial programme of modernisation, including the installation of a gas-fired Dressler Kiln to replace the old Round Kilns. The Dressler kiln allowed the continuous production of ware, and was much more efficient in both fuel and labour than the traditional round kilns.\n\nNew ranges of distinctive domestic wares were quickly introduced including Marlborough, Sapphire, Rosslyn, Mavis and Hotspot. Production of the old Lovatt & Lovatt decorative and art wares mostly ceased and gilding was no longer used. At this time, the use of local clays was phased out and substituted by clays from Devon and Cornwall.\n\nProduction of the pottery at this time was principally domestic wares, but also included a considerable assortment of animal figures and also many utility items such as foot-warmers. It is at this time that the Langley \"Windmill\" trademark first appears. During World War II, (1939–1945), all art ware production ceased and the pottery output was switched to the manufacture of items for various UK Government Departments and products such as the very utilitarian General Household Brown Ware.\n\nDuring the 1950s the pottery brought out a series of more colourful ranges, in particular, Barbecue Ware, Casino, Roulette and Lime Grove. Despite being critically acclaimed by the Council of Industrial Design, these wares unfortunately did not prove to be popular with the public and by 1958 the pottery was once again unprofitable. James Oakes & Co. therefore had no alternative but to put the pottery up for sale.\n\nDuring this time, another major stoneware pottery at neighbouring Denby, Derbyshire (Joseph Bourne & Son) was experiencing difficulties in meeting orders on time due to some technical problems, a lack of production facilities and skilled labour. Joseph Bourne & Son therefore bought the Langley Mill pottery in October 1959, for a reported £25,000. This merger was also seen as a means of preventing the Langley Mill pottery from falling into the hands of Denby's competitors.\n\nThe purchase of the Langley Mill pottery by Denby resulted in a merger of two of the larger producers of domestic stoneware in England. Initially, the two potteries were operated as two separate entities, with their own sales policies and distribution systems remaining unchanged.\n\nHowever, in terms of product lines, the new owners wished to impose a new direction on the Langley Mill pottery, placing a greater emphasis on the production of high quality kitchen ware and giftware. This period therefore saw a considerable number of new stoneware product ranges, some of which were targeted specifically at the American market.\n\nIn 1967 the name of the pottery was changed yet again to Langley Pottery Ltd. Principal designers during this period were the father and son team of Albert and Glyn Colledge and also Gill Pemberton and Thelma Hague. In 1976 the decision was made to unite the two potteries under a single name, so the Langley Pottery Ltd. and Joseph Bourne & Son collectively became Denby Tableware Ltd.\n\nBy the end of the 1970s, the two potteries were beginning to report annual losses, with the result that they were both sold to the Crown House group of companies. One of the first decisions of the new owners was that the Langley Mill site should be closed and production transferred to Denby. The final design to be produced at Langley Mill was \"Falling Leaves\", an oven-to-table ware designed by Thelma Hague.\n\nLangley Mill pottery was closed in December 1982 with a special commemorative plate being produced to mark the last firing of the kiln and the sad end of 117 years of stoneware production. The site was eventually sold and the remaining buildings demolished in 1987. In 1997, the site was redeveloped and is now a small retail park.\n\nIn 1987, the ownership of the remaining Denby pottery changed again, being purchased by the Coloroll Group, but in 1990, as a result of a management buy-out, it once again became an independent pottery, trading as Denby Pottery Company Limited and in 1994 was floated on the London Stock Exchange. It is still producing high quality stoneware today.\n\n\n"}

The backing track was built around many samples, primarily the main riff from Herbie Hancock's track \"Bring Down the Birds\" from the \"Blowup\" soundtrack and Vernon Burch's \"Get Up\", which provided the drum track and also formed the basis for the breakdown featuring a slide whistle. Parliament-Funkadelic bassist Bootsy Collins provided guest vocals, and the rap is provided by Q-Tip of A Tribe Called Quest.\n\nAllMusic editor Ned Raggett wrote in his review of \"World Clique\", \"Its reputation may rest on only one hit single -- but what a hit. \"Groove Is in the Heart\" defined the summer of 1990 on radio and MTV with its delicious combination of funk, modern dance sheen, and Lady Miss Kier's smart, sharp diva ways. Add in guest vocals and bass from Bootsy Collins (a pity his hilarious video cameo wasn't represented here), brass from the original Horny Horns duo of Fred Wesley and Maceo Parker, and a smooth mid-song rap from A Tribe Called Quest's Q-Tip, and the results sounded good then and now.\" Matt Stopera and Brian Galindo from \"BuzzFeed\" noted that it is a \"perfect little slice of the early '90s New York club scene.\" Bevan Hannan from \"The Canberra Times\" described the song as \"good fun\". \"NME\" called it a \"pretty faultless collage of G-Funk, Daisy Age hip-hop, salsa and dippy disco.\" Ross Grady from \"The Rice Thresher\" said it is \"one of the creamiest slabs of vinyl ever to come from the house music scene.\" \"Slant Magazine\" ranked the song second in its 100 Greatest Dance Songs list, adding: \"No song delivered the group's world-conscious Word as colorfully and open-heartedly as 'Groove Is in the Heart,' which flew up the Billboard charts while goosing stuffed shirts\". \"NME\" and \"The Village Voice\"s Pazz & Jop annual critics' poll named \"Groove Is in the Heart\" the best single released in the year 1990.\n\nAn immediate smash in nightclubs, the song went to number one on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart and also hit number four on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It peaked at number 1 for one week in Australia in November 1990.\n\nIn the UK, the record was equally popular and was released as a double A-side with \"What Is Love\", and, with the UK single released with the subtitle \"peanut butter mix\" (because the single was heavily edited and completely omitted the contributions by Bootsy Collins and Q-Tip), it eventually reached number two during September 1990. Its placing second was due to a rule instituted in the UK Singles Chart in the 1980s, which settled any \"ties\" over chart positions due to equal sales: the single with sales that had increased most from the previous week would reside above the other, controversially giving \"The Joker\" by the Steve Miller Band the top place. Following complaints from Deee-Lite's record company, WEA, the rule, of which this had been the only case, was scrapped and joint positions were once again allowed. \"The Joker\" spent a second week at the number one spot and thereafter convincingly outsold \"Groove Is in the Heart\".\n\nThe song was accompanied by a psychedelic music video, with Deee-Lite (in late 1960s outfits), Q-Tip, Maceo Parker and Bootsy Collins superimposed over a cartoonish late 1960s-style background of various shifting shapes and colors. The video opens and closes with quotes by the band: Lady Miss Kier has an opening dialog consisting of \"faux-French\" originally spoken in the song's AA-side, \"What Is Love?\", and the ending features Collins saying, \"Don't forget, groove \"is\" in the heart, and Deee-Lite have definitely been known to smoke... on stage, that is!\" (itself sampled by Deee-Lite in the song) and Lady Miss Kier exclaiming \"Deee-groovy!\"\n\nIn 2003, \"Q Magazine\" ranked \"Groove Is in the Heart\" at number 323 in their list of the \"1001 Best Songs Ever\". \"VH1\" placed it at No. 67 in their list of \"100 Greatest Songs of the 90s\" in 2007. \"Pitchfork\" named it the 59th best track of the 1990s. They wrote: \"With their sass-tastic frontwoman and kitsched-to-death fashion sense, Deee-Lite probably seemed like a good bet at a time when pop's future was still up for grabs. If you were a kid in the 'burbs, they almost resembled a Daisy Age hip-hop group (the day-glo/flower-power look, the Q-Tip guest rap) as much as a house act (a strange urban subculture we had little access to in junior high).\"\n\nIn 2011, \"The Guardian\" featured the song on their \"A history of modern music: Dance\". In April 2017 the single was re-released on pink vinyl, as part of Record Store Day with remixes of \"What Is Love?\" on the B-Side. \"BuzzFeed\" listed the song number 3 in their \"The 101 Greatest Dance Songs of the '90s\" list in 2017.\n\nIn 2018, \"Time Out\" listed the song number 23 in their list of \"The 100 best party songs\", adding: \"In this tale of New York's anything-is-possible East Village of the late '80s, a trio of candy-coloured club kids – Super DJ Dmitri, Lady Miss Kier and Towa Tei – decide to form a band. The threesome (with a little help from ringers Q-Tip, Maceo Parker and Bootsy Collins) come up with 'Groove Is in the Heart', a sweetly innocent percolator of a tune that, against all odds, becomes the worldwide club smash of 1990. True story!\"\n\n\nThis is an incomplete list of samples used in the song.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from the album liner notes for \"World Clique\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2286114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2286114", "title": "Paint It Black", "text": "Paint It Black\n\n\"Paint It Black\" (originally released as \"Paint It, Black\") is a song by the English rock band the Rolling Stones. Jointly credited to the songwriting partnership of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, it was first released as a single on 7 May 1966, and later included as the opening track to the US version of their 1966 album \"Aftermath\".\n\n\"Paint It Black\" reached number one in both the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. The song became the Rolling Stones' third number-one hit single in the US and sixth in the UK. Since its initial release, the song has remained influential as the first number-one hit featuring a sitar, particularly in the UK, where it has charted on two other occasions, and has been the subject of multiple cover versions, compilation albums and film appearances.\n\nIt is one of their most popular songs, and it is on \"Rolling Stone\"s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2018, and it is the 79th best ranked song on critics' all-time lists according to Acclaimed Music.\n\nThe song's lyrics are, for the most part, meant to describe depression through the use of colour-based metaphors. Initially, \"Paint It Black\" was written as a standard pop arrangement, humorously compared by Mick Jagger to \"Songs for Jewish weddings\". The song describes the extreme grief suffered by one stunned by the sudden and unexpected loss of a wife, lover or partner. It is often claimed that Jagger took inspiration from novelist James Joyce's 1922 book \"Ulysses\", taking the excerpt \"I have to turn my head until my darkness goes\", referring to the novel's theme of a worldwide view of desperation and desolation. The song itself came to fruition when the band's leader Brian Jones took an interest in Moroccan music. It was their first song to feature a sitar instrumental.\n\n\"Paint It Black\" came at a pivotal period in the Rolling Stones' recording history, a time that saw the songwriting collaboration of Jagger and Richards assert itself as the principal composer of the band's original material. This is evident from the sessions for the album \"Aftermath\", where for the first time the duo penned the complete track list. In addition, Jones, overshadowed by Jagger and Richards, grew bored with attempting to write songs, as well as conventional guitar melodies. To alleviate the boredom, Jones explored eastern instruments, more specifically the sitar, to bolster the group's musical texture and complexity. A multi-instrumentalist, Jones was able to develop a tune from the sitar in a short amount of time; Jones had a background with the instrument as far back as 1961, largely due to his studies under Harihar Rao, a disciple of Ravi Shankar. Not long after a discussion with George Harrison, who had recently recorded sitar on \"Norwegian Wood\", Jones arranged basic melodies with the instrument that, over time, morphed into the one featured in \"Paint It Black\".\n\nIn a 1995 interview, when commenting on the musical styles found on \"Aftermath\", Jagger described \"Paint It Black\" as a \"kind of Turkish song\". According to the music scholar James E. Perone, while the introductory sitar passage is played in an Indian fashion, \"the rhythmic and melodic feel of the Eastern-sounding phrases actually call to mind the Middle East more than India.\" He adds that the lyrical content – a character \"so entrenched in his depression and rage that he has lost all hope\" – establishes the concept for \"Aftermath\"s American edition, with each of the following songs offering insight into \"the darkness of his psyche\".\n\nThe master take of \"Paint It Black\" was recorded on 8 March 1966, at RCA Studios in Los Angeles, with record producer Andrew Loog Oldham present throughout the process. Much of the early recorded arrangements, and keys of the track were modeled after The Animals' version of \"The House of the Rising Sun\", but The Rolling Stones were dissatisfied with the song, and considered scrapping it. However, while twiddling with a Hammond organ, Bill Wyman searched for a heavier bass sound, while playing the part on his knees. Wyman's playing clicked with the group, and inspired the up-tempo and Eastern pentatonic melody. By all accounts, the sitar was brought into the mix when Harihar Rao happened to walk in the studio with the instrument in hand.\n\nThe sitar was featured in the song. In his book \"Brian Jones: The Making of the Rolling Stones\", Paul Trynka has noted that the influence of Harrison's sitar playing, and, in particular, the Beatles' song \"Norwegian Wood\" on the \"Rubber Soul\" album, draws parallels in \"Paint It Black\"—most noticeably in Jones' droning sitar melody. In response to claims that he was merely imitating the Beatles, however, Jones said: \"What utter rubbish!\" His sitar part on the track immediately became influential in developing a whole subgenre of minor-key psychedelic music. Coupled with this striking instrumental motif, it is complemented by Jagger's droning, and slight nasal vocalization. In addition, \"Paint It Black\" was highlighted by Wyman's heavy bass, Charlie Watts's low-pitch drumming, and Richards' bolero-driven acoustic guitar outro. Soon after, Richards noted that the conclusion of the track was over-recorded, and a different guitar could have potentially improved the song.\n\n\"Paint It Black\" was released in the US on 7 May 1966, reaching number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 during a stay of 11 weeks. In the UK, the song was released on 13 May 1966 and also became a number-one hit on the UK Singles Chart throughout a chart stay of ten weeks. It was originally released as \"Paint It, Black\", the comma being an error by Decca Records, but, nonetheless, stirred controversy among fans over its racial interpretation. Upon further reissues to the UK in 1990 and 2007, \"Paint It Black\" charted at number 61 and 70 respectively.\n\n\"Paint It Black\" has appeared on numerous Stones compilations, including \"Hot Rocks 1964–1971\" (1971), \"30 Greatest Hits\" (1977), \"\" (1989), \"Forty Licks\" (2002), and \"GRRR!\" (2012). Live recordings are featured on the concert albums \"Flashpoint\" (1991), \"Live Licks\" (2004), \"Shine a Light\" (2008), \"Hyde Park Live\" (2013), and \"\" (2016). The song was featured in the music video games \"\", \"Guitar Hero Live\", and \"Rocksmith 2014\", as well as the video games \"\", \"\", and \"Mafia III\".\n\nThe song plays during the end credits of the films \"Full Metal Jacket\" and \"The Devil's Advocate\". In TV, it was used as the opening theme song to the series \"Tour of Duty\" and for the end credits to part five of \"The Vietnam War\" documentary series. It was featured in the \"\" and \"The Mummy\" trailers. The Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball used the song as part of their \"Black Out\" promotions. An orchestral arrangement of the song has been used in multiple episodes of the TV series \"Westworld\". R&B singer Ciara would later cover the song for the soundtrack of the 2015 film \"The Last Witch Hunter\".\n\nAn instrumental version was used in 2018 as background in a TV spot The Future is Built for Ford Motor, featuring Bryan Cranston, as a subtle nod to Henry Ford's famous comment: \"Any customer can have a car painted any colour that he wants so long as it is black.\" The first stanzas have been used in a Coca-Cola ad.\n\nIt is ranked number 176 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, and number 6 on the magazine's list of the band's best songs. According to Acclaimed Music, it is the 79th most celebrated song in popular music. In 2018, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nAccording to Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon's book \"All the Songs\". The authors add a question mark after Jones's guitar contribution and credit \"tambourine, bongos, castanets\" to \"unidentified musicians\".\n\nBefore Eric Burdon & War's 1970 version reached the charts in Netherlands, Eric Burdon covered it on the 1967 Eric Burdon & The Animals debut album, \"Winds of Change\". They also performed a 12:40 version on German TV in 1970. The original album version of Eric Burdon & War had a length of 13:41.\n\nEric Burdon & The Animals performed it at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. This version was cut and included in the motion picture of the festival. They performed it also on the BBC.\n\nEric Burdon performed it also on his \"Hippiefest\" tour in 2008.\n\nThe song has been covered by more than 50 artists including U2, Rick Wakeman, Glenn Tipton (guitarist of Judas Priest), Marilyn Manson, Chris Farlowe, Dee Snider with George Lynch, Vanessa Carlton and Caterina Caselli as well as by Ramin Djawadi for the Westworld television series. Ciara recorded her version for the film \"The Last Witch Hunter\".\n"}

It is his last full-length studio album of new original material to date, as the subsequent albums \"Scratch My Back\" and \"New Blood\" feature covers of other artists' songs and orchestral renderings of Gabriel's older material, respectively.\n\nGabriel began work on the album in the spring of 1995. Its name was \"Up\" from the start, though at one point the name \"I/O\" was considered. Gabriel began saying the album was near completion somewhere around 1998 but did not release it until September 2002. In the months preceding the album's release, video clips of Gabriel talking about the songs as well as short demos of each song were released at the coming of every full moon on Gabriel's official website.\n\nThe album's lyrics deal mostly with birth and especially death. The opening track, \"Darkness\", is a song about overcoming fears. \"Growing Up\" is a summation of life put to a pulsating beat. \"Sky Blue\" is a track Gabriel claimed to have been working on for 10 years before finishing it. The track \"No Way Out\" is the first track to deal with death solely, though death is a common theme across the entire album. \"I Grieve\" was conceived after Gabriel looked over his catalogue of music as if it were a catalogue of emotional tools. He found one major missing tool to be one to cope with death and therefore \"I Grieve\" was born. Gabriel performed the song live on the television show \"Larry King Weekend\" on the first anniversary of September 11 attacks in the U.S., during which Gabriel said that his two daughters were living in New York City and he could not contact them for some time, and that this song was for people who did not hear anything from their relatives then. It was not, however, written specifically for 9/11, having appeared on the \"City of Angels\" soundtrack in 1998 (in an earlier version) and performed live prior to 9/11.\n\nThe first single from \"Up\", \"The Barry Williams Show\" is a down-beat, jazzy song dealing with reality talk shows such as Jerry Springer (in fact, \"The Brady Bunch\" star Barry Williams appeared as an audience member in the Sean Penn-directed music video for the song with \"Requiem for a Dream\" actor Christopher McDonald playing the titular talk show host).\n\nThe song \"Signal to Noise\" was a challenge for Gabriel because the guest vocalist for the track, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, died before he could record his parts. All that was left to work with were recordings from a live performance of an early version of the song at the VH1 Witness show on 28 April 1996. Finally, \"The Drop\" consists of only Gabriel and a Bösendorfer grand piano.\n\nThe album cover pictures five water drops in a diagonal line, over a blurred background of Gabriel's face. Each drop contains a refracted image of Gabriel's face.\n\nThe album is available in stereo on CD & vinyl while Surround Sound versions are encoded in Super Audio CD, and DTS DVD-A.\n\nThe album, in a similar fashion to the earlier \"Us\", used specially commissioned artwork representing each song, which was reproduced in the CD, vinyl, DVD-A, and SACD packaging. In this case the medium chosen was photography. Pictures are by Arno Rafael Minkkinen for \"Darkness\", M. Richard Kirstel for \"Growing up\", Shomei Tomatsu for \"Sky Blue\" and \"I Grieve\", Mari Mahr for \"No Way Out\", Paul Thorel for \"The Barry Williams Show\", Granular-Synthesis (Kurt Hentschläger and Ulf Langheinrich) for \"My Head Sounds Like That\", Susan Derges for \"More Than This\", Michal Rovner for \"Signal to Noise\", Adam Fuss for \"The Drop.\"\n\n\"Up\" has received generally favourable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 74, based on 16 reviews.\n\n\n\n"}

Educated at Bedford Modern School, Morgan emigrated to South Australia, arriving in Port Adelaide on 13 February 1849 in the \"Glenelg\". Initially he worked on land near the Murray River, his life was saved by an Indigenous Australian named Ranembe, whose name Morgan gave later to one of his sons. Then Morgan worked for Boord Brothers grocers; and at the beginning of 1852 he went to the Victorian gold rush. He had modest success, returned to Adelaide, and with a brother he purchased the Boord's business, establishing William Morgan & Co. and made it a successful enterprise. In 1865 he became a founder of the Bank of Adelaide. He founded, with Charles Hawkes Todd Connor and William Dening Glyde the firm of Morgan, Connor & Glyde, wheat and flour merchants of 43 King William Street. Glyde's brother Samuel Dening Glyde joined the company and soon became a partner. In 1882 they joined a consortium, the Adelaide Milling and Mercantile Company, with John Hart & Co., W. Duffield & Co., James Cowan & Co. and Harrold Brothers; Morgan was their foundation Chairman.\n\nMorgan was elected to the South Australian Legislative Council in August 1867, and was chief secretary in the second James Boucaut government from June 1875 to March 1876. He was chief secretary again in the fourth Boucaut ministry from October 1877 to September 1878, and when Boucaut became a judge, Morgan reconstructed the ministry and on 27 September 1878 became premier and chief secretary. This ministry was in office for nearly three years but it did not have an easy passage. One important measure passed was that providing deep drainage for Adelaide, the first city in Australia to have a proper sewerage system. A public trustee act was passed, and there was some railway extension, but other bills were rejected by the council.\n\nPressure of private business, including bad investments in New Caledonia, resulted in Morgan's resignation on 24 June 1881, and the John Bray ministry came in. He was created K.C.M.G. in 1883. In May that year Morgan left Australia on a visit to England and he died suddenly on 2 November at Brighton, Sussex, aged 65.\n\nMorgan was a self-made man who had liberal opinions. He was an avid free-trader who held that protective duties taxed the people least able to bear the burden. He was an excellent speaker, able administrator and might have had a more important place in South Australian politics if he had lived longer.\n\nOn 8 July 1854 Morgan married Harriett, daughter of Thomas Matthews of Hurd's Hill, Coromandel Valley; together they had nine children. Harriet survived him with two sons and two daughters, including:\n"}

The international recognition, status and value of HETAC qualifications is assured as the demand for graduates continues to grow at home and abroad.\n\nHETAC complies with the standards and guidelines set by the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (ENQA).\n\nIn 2004, Griffith became the first independent college in the country to have its degrees (LLB and BA in Business & Law) recognised by the Honorable Society of King's Inns. for the purposes of admission to its annual entrance examinations. Having successfully completed these five examinations, students may then complete the Barrister of Law degree in just one year. which is a professional qualification for practice at the bar.\n\nOverlooking Dublin's famous Grand Canal, Griffith College was originally an army barracks dating from the 1830s. Griffith Halls of Residence, commonly referred to as GHR) is located on campus and is a new apartment complex. This on-site accommodation can house 160+ students, with 24-hour security and reception. GHR is open to all students living and studying in Dublin, and is not dedicated solely to Griffith students.\n\nDuring the spring students from the Journalism & Media Faculty operate a radio station from the campus. The radio station is licensed by the BAI (and the BCI before that) to broadcast for a couple of weeks. This year GriffFM broadcasts on 92.1 FM from 1–15 February and will be relayed online on. The station airs both hard news and music-oriented programmes produced and presented by second year journalism degree students and postgraduate journalism students.\n\nThere are a number of college publications. is the newspaper published by Journalism students, where examples of student work get published. The paper won the award for \"Small College Publication of the Year\" at the annual Oxygen Student Media (sMedia) Awards in 2005 and 2006, while Griffiti won in 2007. \"The Griff\", \"The Griffin\", \"90 Degrees\" and \"Maverick\" are other student publications which have been produced by degree, higher diploma and Print journalism students in the past. \"X-press\" magazine was produced in 2008 by third year journalism and media students.\n\n\"Glór uí Ghríofa\" (The Voice of Griffith) is the official college newsletter outlining college news, developments and campus life.\n\nThe college facilities include Library, Common room, Computer Laboratories (248 workstations across 10 labs), CAD Lab, Photography Lab, Fitness Room, Sound Studios, Shop and Bar & Restaurant. The college also offers students a career advice service there is also a professional counsellor off campus providing an advice and counselling for personal and non-academic issues.\n\nThe College Library provides research and study facilities to students (and to college alumni), the library holds an extensive range of set course texts and background reading material for all college programmes.\n\nGriffith Conference Center is located on the college campus. The facilities include a 575-seat Auditorium, as well as smaller Suites and Rooms for hire. The Buildings were officially opened by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern in September 2006.\nThe Conference Centre has been used for a variety of functions such as conventions of political parties, medical bodies, industry groups or for television programmes such as the \"You're a Star\" auditions.\n\n\n\nOver the years Griffith College has expanded beyond its base in Dublin.\n\nHaving previously established its Professional Accountancy Programmes in Cork in 2000, offering training in ACCA, CIMA, CPA and IATI, Griffith College acquired Skerry's College Cork in 2005, forming Griffith College Cork the college runs a variety of full- and part-time courses in Business, Law, Media & Communications, Design, Secretarial and Office skills.\n\nIn 2006 Griffith College opened in Limerick with the acquisition of the Mid West Business Institute, creating Griffith College Limerick. In 2009 Griffith College Limerick moved into new premises which were officially opened by the Minister of Defence Willie O'Dea T.D. on 23 January 2009.\n\nThere is also one campus based in Moscow which mainly offers accountancy courses.\n\nIn 2009 the Professional Law courses were made available completely online – such as the FE1 and IILEX courses.\n\nIn Spring 2013 Griffith College Cork expanded to a 5.3 acre campus on Wellington Road, Cork City, on the former site of St. Patrick's Hospital and Marymount Hospice. The Campus is called 'Griffith College Cork, Wellington Road Campus'. Teaching commenced at the Wellington Road campus in Summer 2013 with an English Language Residential School.\n\nSince August 2013 all evening undergraduate, postgraduate, short-term and professional programmes in the areas of Law, Business, Journalism and Media Communications, Accountancy and Drama have moved to the facility.\n\nSt. Angela's College, Cork has sub-let the former hospital and hospice areas of the campus for three years, to facilitate a major renovation of their existing school, and the construction of new buildings, on St. Patrick's Hill.\n\nThe St. Angela's Development Plan has been in place for some time, and their architects, O'Donnell and Toomey, have designed an adaptation of the old Marymount buildings. The conversion of Marymount will provide St. Angela's College with extra facilities including more classrooms, ICT and Science facilities. Within the campus Griffith College and St. Angela's will operate as separate entities, having different entrances and buildings.\n\nSt. Patrick's Hospital and Marymount Hospice occupied this building until 2011, when, 141 years after it first opened its doors, the institution relocated all of its services to new premises at Curraheen in Cork.\n\nThe college graduation ceremonies take place over two days each November in the Conference Center. In previous years the ceremony took place in Royal Hospital Kilmainham in 2004 and 2005, and St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin the year before that.\n\nThe 2002 graduation was addressed by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, Education Minister Noel Dempsey address the 2003 Graduation and in 2005 justice minister Michael McDowell addressed Law graduates. In attendance are graduates with their families and friends, representatives of Validation Bodies, as well as political and diplomatic dignitaries. At the graduation ceremony there are prizes awarded such as \"HETAC Student of the Year Award\" and Best Academic Achievements for each faculty and school.\n"}

It was the first game based on the German pen & paper RPG system \"The Dark Eye\" by Schmidt Spiele. The original German version of the game (German title: \"Das Schwarze Auge: Die Schicksalsklinge\") was released in 1992. Due to its success it was translated to English and released by Sir-Tech in 1993.\n\n\"Realms of Arkania: Blade of Destiny\" is a classical 3D party role-playing video game that has up to six characters (plus an optional NPC that may be recruited) moving through 3D towns and dungeons. Travels between those 3D levels were simulated by showing a path on a regional 2D map. The game generally uses the same pseudo-3D-engine as Attic's 1991 game \"Spirit of Adventure\", utilizing an increased resolution for the 3D part of the screen. The game also borrowed ideas from \"Eye of the Beholder\" (the inventory user interface) and \"\" (the main screen user interface layout). The game did not feature NPC/monster sprites in the 3D view (a shortcoming that can be found in the entire \"Northlands Trilogy\") that were already introduced by the first 3D real-time action role-playing video game - \"Dungeon Master\" - in 1987. Instead of visualizing fights in the 3D view, the game switched to the isometric perspective for a unique turn-based tactical combat simulation.\n\nAn orc chief has united all tribes of the orcs and plans to attack the lands of the humans. The player is hired by Hetman Tronde Torbensson, the leader of the Thorwalians, to find the sword \"Grimring\" (the Blade of Destiny) and prevent an orc invasion on Thorwal. However, Grimring has been lost since the death of its bearer, the Hetman Hyggelik the Great. In order to recover the sword, the player must find pieces of a treasure map which shows the location of the sword. Once the sword is recovered the player needs to defeat the orc chief and his minions. If the player does not succeed within about two in-game years, the orcs will attack and the player loses.\n\n\"Blade of Destiny\" was the first game in the \"Northlands Trilogy\", it was followed by \"\", and \"\". As a feature players could save the game after beating it, this allowed the players to import their characters into any of the sequels.\n\nA remake developed by the Austrian Crafty Studios and published by German United Independent Entertainment was released on Steam on July 30, 2013. Metacritic, a review aggregator, rated it 18/100 based on five reviews. This is one of Metacritic's lowest ratings for a PC game. On release, the game was plagued with bugs, and the developer's forums were full of complaints. Crafty Studios eventually posted an apology to Steam in which they promised to update the game. Steven Strom of \"Ars Technica\", in an article where he played each of the five worst-rated games on Metacritic, said the remake is playable but still feels unfinished, including untranslated dialogue.\n\nAccording to \"Die Zeit\", all three games in the \"Realms of Arkania\" series, including \"Blade of Destiny\", were commercially and critically successful. The paper's Nicole Lange reported in 2011 that the three entries together had surpassed 2.4 million sales worldwide.\n\nIn a 1993 review from \"Computer Gaming World\", Scorpia wrote, \"'Das Schwarze Auge' means 'The Black Eye,' and that might be appropriate here\". She wrote that \"there are so many things wrong with the game play that we should start off with the few that are right\" such as automapping and extra experience points for fighting unfamiliar enemies, but criticized the \"awkward and confusing\" magic system, discrepancies between the documentation and gameplay. Worst of all, she wrote, were the reduction in experience points for saving outside a temple, high failure rates during combat, and a bug that \"won\" the game by quitting during the final fight.\n\n\"The One\" gave the Amiga version of \"Blade of Destiny\" an overall score of 73%, criticizing its graphics and small draw distance, saying \"you can't even 'see' the poorly-drawn buildings until you're practically standing in front of them\" and calling it a generic RPG, stating \"The main problem with \"Blade of Destiny\" is that you really have seen this sort of thing before - and better, most probably. There are few surprises as you travel around, with everyone and everything you meet conforming to their usual clichéd fantasy roles.\" \"The One\" criticized the combat, calling it \"uninspiring\", and expressed that the 'movement points' system removes a sense of urgency.\n\nChris W. McCubbin reviewed \"Realms of Arkania: Blade of Destiny\" in \"Pyramid\" #6 (March/April, 1994), and stated that \"I have no hesitancy about recommending \"Realms of Arkania\" for what it does well -- graphics, story and background. And I remain optimistic about the combat problems as well. After all, \"Blade of Destiny\" is only the first game in the \"Realms of Arkania\" series. If subsequent games correct the unrealistic aspects of ranged combat, \"Realms of Arkania\" could easily be a state-of-the art game for mature, discerning computer gamers.\"\n\n"}

He was jailed by the Derg and later by the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). After his death, \"The Guardian\" described him as \"successively Ethiopia's most distinguished surgeon, physician and university dean, most controversial political party leader and best known political prisoner\".\n\nAsrat studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, becoming the first Ethiopian to qualify as a surgeon in the West. He then returned to Ethiopia, serving as Emperor Haile Selassie's personal physician until his 1975 death. He continued teaching and practicing medicine throughout the rule of President Mengistu Haile-Mariam.\n\nWhen Meles Zenawi succeeded Mengistu in 1991, Asrat became an active critic of the government, particularly of Meles' formation of new autonomous regions in Ethiopia. He then formed his own political party, the AAPO, with a central tenet of restoring Ethiopian unity. In 1994, he was sentenced to two years in prison for \"planning violence against the state\". International human rights organizations protested the evidence against him as unsound, and Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience. He was later convicted of more charges, extending his sentence by an additional three years. In 1996, Asrat faced a new trial which was repeatedly adjourned, keeping him in prison indefinitely.\n\nIn 1998, Asrat, who had previously had bypass surgery, developed further heart problems, and government doctors stated that he needed treatment overseas to survive. However, the Ethiopian government initially denied him permission to travel, triggering international appeals on his behalf. On December 25, 1998, authorities yielded to international pressure, granting him a compassionate release and allowing him treatment in Houston. Though his treatment was at first successful, Asrat died five months later of his heart ailment at the University of Pennsylvania hospital in Philadelphia.\n"}

Most of the on-reserve population lives near The Pas on the OCN 21E Reserve, but the band also has many other reserves stretching from Goose Lake, Manitoba in the north to Mountain Cabin, Saskatchewan in the south.\n\nThe First Nation hosts the Opaskwayak Indian Days annually each August. The OCN Blizzard, a Manitoba Junior Hockey League team, is based on the Indian reserve and plays out of the Gordon Lathlin Memorial Centre. OCN is accessible by rail, road, water, and air travel.\n\nThe current townsite of Opaskwayak, reserve parcel 21E, was a historical gathering place where people travelled for spiritual healing. The area Cree would meet here every summer to fish, harvest, and cultivate the land. Also during this time it was an opportunity for creating social ties and practising the ceremonial way of life known as the or Grand Medicine Society.\n\nThe language of the Opaskwayak people is from the Swampy Cree \"n\"-dialect. There was a number of local bands who shared the same defined territory which in turn, composed of a number of interrelated families who came together periodically through the year for various social, cultural activities and ceremonies.\n\nWhen the Opaskwayak people signed Treaty 5 on in 1876, the federal government agreed to give the band Timber Rights. In 1904, the band opened a sawmill on Mission Island in the Saskatchewan River. Soon after, the band surrendered their land on the south side of the river, and in 1908, they moved their sawmill to the north side. The sawmill operated intermittently until 1930, and provided wood for most of the homes built in the first few decades of the 20th century.\n\nThe nation has made many developments, including the Joe. A. Ross, Oscar Lathlin Collegiate, and a Community Plex for the events such as bingos, socials and community events, etc. The local hotel, known as Kikiwak Inn, was built and completed in July 1996. The Otineka Shopping Mall was built in the early 1970s and opened in the 1975 which has various retail outlets. The McGillivary Care Home was constructed in 1982 for community elders. The community of Opaskwayak Cree Nation has two churches on the reserve. The Church of Redeemer is situated in Big Eddy, and the Church of Messiah is situated in the townsite area. Both of these churches have been recently constructed to replace the old churches.\n\nAccording to oral traditions Cree people have occupied the landscape of north-central Manitoba since a time before memory; archaeology supports this. The earliest archeological evidence of the people occupying the area has been carbon dated 2,600–4,000 years ago.\n\nThe Band is governed by the Chief and eight Councilors, who are elected according to its own election code which was adopted by its members in 2012, for a three-year term. The reserve consists of 24 parcels of land varying in size from 10 to 5200 acres and totaling about 45,000 acres. The most populated settlements are located in and around the Town of The Pas. Most of the reserve's borders are with the Rural Municipality of Kelsey and the Town of The Pas. The balance is with the unorganized portion of Census Division No. 21.\n"}

The term is usually restricted to \"Shigella\" infections.\n\nShigellosis is caused by one of several types of \"Shigella\" bacteria. Three species are associated with bacillary dysentery: \"Shigella sonnei, Shigella flexneri\" and \"Shigella dysenteriae\". A study in China indicated that \"Shigella flexneri\" 2a was the most common serotype.\n\nSalmonellosis caused by \"Salmonella enterica\" (serovar \"Typhimurium\") has also been described as a cause of bacillary dysentery, though this definition is less common. It is sometimes listed as an explicit differential diagnosis of bacillary dysentery, as opposed to a cause.\n\nBacillary dysentery should not be confused with diarrhea caused by other bacterial infections. One characteristic of bacillary dysentery is blood in stool, which is the result of invasion of the mucosa by the pathogen.\n\nTransmission is fecal-oral and is remarkable for the small number of organisms that may cause disease (10 ingested organisms cause illness in 10% of volunteers, and 500 organisms cause disease in 50% of volunteers). \"Shigella\" bacteria invade the intestinal mucosal cells but do not usually go beyond the lamina propria. Dysentery is caused when the bacteria escape the epithelial cell phagolysosome, multiply within the cytoplasm, and destroy host cells. Shiga toxin causes hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome by damaging endothelial cells in the microvasculature of the colon and the glomeruli, respectively. In addition, chronic arthritis secondary to \"S. flexneri\" infection, called reactive arthritis, may be caused by a bacterial antigen; the occurrence of this syndrome is strongly linked to HLA-B27 genotype, but the immunologic basis of this reaction is not understood.\n\nSpecimen: Fresh stool is collected.\n\nCulture: Specimen is inoculated on selective media like MacConkey's agar, DCA, XLD agar. Selenite F broth(0.4%) is used as enrichment medium which permits the rapid growth of enteric pathogens while inhibiting the growth of normal flora like \"E. coli\" for 6–8 hours. Subculture is done on the solid media from selenite F broth. All the solid media are incubated at 37 degrees for 24 hours.\n\nCultural characteristics: Colorless (NLF) colonies appear on MacConkey's agar which are further confirmed by gram staining, hanging drop preparation and biochemical reactions.\n\nDysentery is initially managed by maintaining fluid intake using oral rehydration therapy. If this treatment cannot be adequately maintained due to vomiting or the profuseness of diarrhea, hospital admission may be required for intravenous fluid replacement. Ideally, no antimicrobial therapy should be administered until microbiological microscopy and culture studies have established the specific infection involved. When laboratory services are not available, it may be necessary to administer a combination of drugs, including an amoebicidal drug to kill the parasite and an antibiotic to treat any associated bacterial infection.\n\nAnyone with bloody diarrhea needs immediate medical help. Treatment often starts with an oral rehydrating solution—water mixed with salt and carbohydrates—to prevent dehydration. (Emergency relief services often distribute inexpensive packets of sugars and mineral salts that can be mixed with clean water and used to restore lifesaving fluids in dehydrated children gravely ill from dysentery.)\n\nIf \"Shigella\" is suspected and it is not too severe, the doctor may recommend letting it run its course—usually less than a week.

The player is recruited in the city Kvirasim by an elf ambassador to recover an old artifact, the Salamander Stone, that could unite the elves and the dwarfs for battle against the orcs. Immediately a mysterious third party which seems to be against the uniting of the dwarves and elves counter offers riches and bribery. The quest leads them first to the depths of a long abandoned dwarven mine in the mountains. There they must walk a fine line between taking what they need and taking out of avarice. If successful they meet a master smith, who forges an asthenil sword for them and lets them swap it for the Salamander Stone.\n\nLeaving the mines with the Salamander Stone, they are instructed to take the stone to an orc besieged city of Lowangen. The party is allowed past the orcish blockade, only after they leave behind most of their heavy weapons and armor. Once inside the city, they are robbed of the Salamander Stone. While attempting to locate it the group runs into cultists serving an unknown god. The cult comprises humans and elves. After a bloody fight, the group finds two Salamander Stones, one fake and one genuine. There is a notice of instruction telling the cult to send the real one off to the north to their leader.\n\nThe group travels to the northernmost city on the map and finds it completely deserted. Upon entering one house they find a trap door leading below the house to an underground base of the cult. Within its first floor, they find a warrioress frozen in a solid block of ice. She joins the group after the player character thaws her out but leaves as the party moves to the third and final floor.\n\nOn the last floor is a temple to the Nameless God. At the very back the party finds the dwarven ambassador, Ingramosch, petrified in stone and the mysterious third party that first tried to offer them riches for the Salamander Stone. He is actually a powerful sorcerer. After taunting the party, he casts a spell that teleports him to the massive cave behind him. A huge dragon comes forth and starts breathing flames at the party. After battling the party for some time, the dragon finds them honorable and allows them to live. As he disappears into his cave, the player character uses the salamander stone to flesh spell upon Ingramosch. They climb out of the dungeon and find the elven ambassador waiting with a horse-drawn carriage. He takes the party to the harbor where a boat is waiting. The elf spends days healing the dwarf with magic. When Ingramosch comes to, they give him the Salamander Stone.\n\nAfter arriving at the tree city of the elves, the dwarves and elves hammer out an alliance. In celebration, the group is treated to a feast in the tree city, where the rarely seen elf king shows up and thanks the group for all its success and hails them as friends forever to elves everywhere.\n\n\"\" was the first game in the trilogy.

It was roughly the equivalent of the German 88 mm FlaK and American 90 mm, but with a slightly larger calibre of 3.7 inches, approximately 94 mm. Production began in 1937 and it was used throughout World War II in all theatres except the Eastern Front. It remained in use after the war until AA guns were replaced by guided missiles beginning in 1957.\n\nThe gun was produced in two versions, one mobile and another fixed. The fixed mounting allowed more powerful ammunition, Mk. VI, which gave vastly increased performance. Six variants of the two designs were introduced. The gun was also used as the basis for the Ordnance QF 32-pounder anti-tank gun variant used on the Tortoise heavy assault tank.\n\nDuring World War I, anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft gunnery developed rapidly. The British Army eventually adopted the QF 3-inch 20 cwt as the most commonly used type. Shortly before the end of the war, a new QF 3.6 inch gun was accepted for service but the end of the war meant it did not enter production. After the war, all anti-aircraft guns except the three-inch gun were scrapped.\n\nHowever, the war had shown the possibilities and potential for air attack and lessons had been learned. The British had used AA guns in most theatres in daylight, as well as against night attacks at home. They had also formed an AA Experimental Section during the war and accumulated much data that was subjected to extensive analysis. After an immediate post-war hiatus, the army re-established peacetime anti-aircraft units in 1922. In 1925, the RAF established a new command, Air Defence of Great Britain, and the Royal Artillery's anti-aircraft units were placed under its command.\n\nIn 1924–5, the war office published the two-volume \"Textbook of Anti-Aircraft Gunnery\". It included five key recommendations for heavy anti-aircraft (HAA) guns:\n\nTwo assumptions underpinned the British approach to HAA fire. First, aimed fire was the primary method and this was enabled by predicting gun data from visually tracking the target with continuous height and range input. Second, that the target would maintain a steady course, speed and height. Heavy anti-aircraft units were to engage targets up to . Mechanical, as opposed to igniferous, time fuzes were required because the speed of powder burning varied with height so fuze length was not a simple function of time of flight. Automated fire ensured a constant rate of fire that made it easier to predict where each shell should be individually aimed.\n\nDuring the 1920s, Vickers developed the Vickers Predictor, an electro-mechanical computer that took height and range data from an optical rangefinder, applied corrections for non-standard conditions and was used by its operators to visually track a target, its output predicted firing data and fuse setting via the \"mag-slip\" electrical induction system to dials on each gun in a battery, the gun layers moved the gun to match pointers on the dials. The three-inch AA guns were modified accordingly.\n\nIn 1928, the general characteristics for a new HAA gun were agreed, a bore of firing shells with a ceiling of . Financial stringency led to no action being taken until the 1930s, when the specification was enhanced to a shell, muzzle velocity, a ceiling, a towed road speed of , maximum weight of eight tons and an into action time of 15 minutes.\n\nIn 1934, Vickers Armstrong produced a mock-up and proceeded to develop prototypes of the weapon, which was selected and passed acceptance tests in 1936. The weight specification was exceeded, the muzzle velocity not achieved and the mechanical time fuze, No. 206, was still some years from production. The igniferous No. 199 had to be used and its lesser running time limited the effective ceiling. Gun production started the following year.\n\nOn 1 January 1938, the British air defences had only 180 anti-aircraft guns larger than 50 mm and most of these were the older 3-inch guns. This number increased to 341 by the September 1938 (Munich Crisis), to 540 in September 1939 (declaration of war), and to 1,140 during the Battle of Britain. Production continued until 1945, averaging 228 guns per month throughout the period. Guns were also manufactured in Australia.\n\nBeing a high-velocity gun, with a single charge and firing substantial quantities of ammunition, meant that barrel life could be short and by the end of 1940 there was a barrel shortage. Some of the substantial numbers of spare barrels required were produced in Canada.\n\nIn British service, the gun replaced the 3-inch AA gun in HAA batteries of the Royal Artillery, almost always in HAA regiments, which were usually in an anti-aircraft brigade. Each regiment usually had three batteries, each of eight guns in two troops. A total of 212 of these HAA regiments, Royal Artillery, plus two each for the Royal Marines and Royal Malta Artillery, were eventually formed. Other World War II users were India (about 14 regiments), Canada (two or three regiments), East and West Africa (five regiments), and Australia (equivalent of about 13 regiments).\n\nTwo versions of the gun were produced. One used a travelling carriage, for use by batteries in the field army. This consisted of a wheeled carriage (Carriage Mk I or Mk III) with four folding outrigger trails and levelling jacks. The wheels were lifted off the ground or removed when the gun was brought into action.\n\nThe other used a travelling platform (Mounting Mk II) with detachable wheels for guns to be used in static positions but which could be re-positioned. The mounting had a pedestal that was fixed to a solidly constructed, preferably concrete, platform on the ground. In 1944, it was found that a temporary platform built from railway sleepers and rails was adequate for the static guns, making them considerably easier to re-deploy without the cost and delay of constructing new concrete platforms. These were known as \"Pile platforms\", after the head of Anti-Aircraft Command, General Frederick Alfred Pile.\n\nIn both cases, the saddle rotated 360° on the carriage or pedestal and provided elevation up to 80°. An AEC Matador was the normal gun tractor. There were six marks of ordnance (the barrel and breech assembly) and a few marks of carriage of both versions, some using letter suffixes. The carriage included the recoil system, laying arrangements, fuse setting and loading machinery. The Mk IIC mounting enabled fully automatic engagements, apart from putting shells into the feed to the machine fuze setter.\n\nInitially, there were HE and shrapnel shells, both fitted with a time fuze. Fuze No.199 was igniferous (i.e. powder-burning) with a maximum running time of 30 seconds. Fuzes No. 106 and 107 were mechanical time fuses; both proved unsatisfactory. Fuze No. 208, with a maximum running time of 43 seconds, became the standard fuze. A great improvement in 1942 was the introduction of Machine Fuze Setter No. 11, on Mounting Mk. IIC and Carriage Mk. IIIA, which raised the rate of fire to 20 rounds per minute.\n\nMonobloc barrel.\n\nBarrel changed to loose liner.\n\nThe Mk III started as a combination of the Mk I breech with the Mk II barrel.\n\nA prototype development of the 3.7-inch gun using the QF 4.5-inch naval gun Mk V barrel with a liner to give a gun using a size cartridge case to drive the shell. The barrel wear proved excessive and it was dropped in favour of the Mk VI.\n\nSimilar to the Mk IV. Also dropped in favour of the Mk VI.\n\nLike the Mk IV this was based on the 4.5 inch barrel design lined down to 3.7 inches, and using the 4.5 inch size cartridge. However, Colonel Probert changed the barrel to have gradual rifling: the rifling groove depth decreased to zero over the last five calibres of the barrel before the muzzle. This smoothed the two driving bands of a new design shell giving reduced air resistance and hence better ballistic performance, and causing far less barrel wear. The maximum ceiling for the gun was about . It was mounted on the Mounting Mk IIA and therefore deployed in static emplacements only. In service from 1944 to 1959.\n\nThe gun's effective ceiling varied depending on the predictor and fuse. The Mk VI ordnance significantly increased the potential effective ceiling. The British definition of effective ceiling at the start of World War II was \"that height at which a directly approaching target at 400 mph can be engaged for 20 seconds before the gun reaches 70° elevation\"\n\nLike other British guns, the 3.7 had a secondary direct fire role for defending its position against tank attack. During the North African Campaign, the 3.7 was considered for use explicitly as an anti-tank weapon due to the shortage of suitable anti-tank guns. Sighting arrangements were improved for the anti-tank role, but the weapon was far from ideal. Its size and weight - two tons heavier than the German 8.8 cm - made it tactically unsuitable for use in forward areas. The mounting and recuperating gear were also not designed to handle the strain of prolonged firing at low elevations.\n\nThe 3.7 found little use as a dedicated anti-tank gun except in emergencies. There were few 3.7-equipped heavy anti-aircraft regiments in the field army and most were not subordinate to divisions where the anti-tank capability was required. The arrival of the smaller 76 mm (3-inch) calibre 17-pdr anti-tank gun finally obviated the need.\n\nThe 3.7 was employed extensively as field artillery - typically for counter-battery or counter-mortar fire - during the second half of the war, in Italy, north-west Europe, Burma and the south-west Pacific. Batteries were issued with the necessary fire control equipment. However, the HE ammunition seems to have always been fuzed for airburst, which limited range to with the No. 199 fuze, and with the No. 208 fuze.\nThe Ordnance QF 32 pounder was developed from the 3.7-inch gun and armed the Tortoise self-propelled gun. Canada also experimented with mounting the 3.7-inch gun on the Ram tank chassis. Neither vehicle saw service.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a sequel to \"\" and \"\". The original German version of the game was published by TopWare Interactive in 1996. Sir-Tech released the English version in 1997.\n\nThe game was re-released with Windows support in 2009 on GOG.com, with macOS support added in 2013; it as also released in 2014 on Steam.\n\n\"Shadows over Riva\" picks up where the party left off in \"\". After uniting the dwarves and elves, the party stops by the harbor city of Riva, which is currently under siege by the Orcish hordes. The city is on edge. The countryside's once-lucrative dwarven mine has been decimated and occupied by the Orcs after a string of well-coordinated attacks. For some unknown reason, the magistrate refuses to recognize the threat the orcs pose just outside the city gates. Meanwhile, rumors abound of traitors in the slum ridden-Hoberkian community and strange corpse disappearances within the city's graveyard, the Field of Boron.\n\nAs the party investigates each lead, more questions seem to surface than answers. After penetrating the dwarven mines the deviousness of the traps suggests that the Orcs have somehow become much smarter and more organized than normally possible. No longer are they fragmented tribes warring among themselves. They speak of a single, wise, all-powerful chieftain with the powers of a wizard. Upon confronting the chieftain deep within the mines, he summons a massive demon from the underworld to fight the party. This alone is rare, as orcs have never had the intelligence required to master magic, let alone the skills of one of the most powerful wizards. Since this has not been the only time the party has fought demons, the party manages to kill it, sending it back to the underworld. Upon killing the Orc chieftain, a tiny worm emerges from chieftain's head and flees.\n\nReturning to the city with this new information, the party still finds the city's magistrate apathetic. They befriend the Holberkians when they save one of them from a mob. Far from the traitors they had been painted, it turns out the Hoberkians are faithful friends. Being half-elves and half-Orcs, they have knowledge of the orcish hordes, earning the enmity of the city, which thinks they are responsible for the Orcish siege of the city. They also have noticed a pronounced change in the Orcs' activity, suggesting an outside influence. They reveal a long-absent sorcerer living on an island in the swamp who could have been responsible for the changes in the orcs. The next day, one of the Hoberkians takes the party to the sorcerer's tower. There the party finds numerous experiments and letters all pointing to a person known only as Borborad and his shipment of two worm queens. One queen was delivered but a second was lost en route when the urn sank with a cargo ship in Riva's harbor during a storm. Research notes further reveal a wealth of information on the worm spawn from the queen. They possessed extreme intelligence and could possess hosts by entering their brains through the nose. They were also linked telepathically to the queen who spawned them and could not be killed unless you killed the queen who resided within a hive which was invincible to attack due to the queen's magic.\n\nAfter returning to Riva, the party speaks with the magistrate about their suspicions. Instead of immediate action, the magistrate dismisses the group. Within the day, they are framed for murder. It is at this time that an underground movement contacts the group and offers them sanctuary as well as the use of a tunnel system that surfaces in every temple. They are informed of the movement's suspicions that the magistrate is under some unknown influence, possibly a worm spawn. If so, it would explain why the party was framed for murder—they know too much and are a threat to exposing the entire plot. They are told to rescue a group of wizards from the magistrate's prison island during the night. There they see attempted worm implantation which the wizard manages to fight off. After the rescue, the wizards inform the group that it was the magistrate who had an expedition to recover the sunken ship items from the harbor. One of the urns was brought to him. Upon opening the urn, the worm queen was released. It possessed the magistrate, established a hive, and used its worm spawn to possess various people around the city. The worm queen is able to hear and see everything the possessed townsfolk see and hear. The group is told that the one remaining urn in the sunken ship is required to learn more about the queen and a means to defeat them. After obtaining the urn from the merfolk that lives in the waters near Riva's harbor, the wizards spend a few days studying the queen inside.\n\nWhen they finally summon the group, they give them a shrinking spell that reduces them to worm size, allowing them to enter the magically reinforced hive. They fight their way through the hive, pick their way through a confusing maze, and fight off telepathic nightmares sent by the queen. Finally, they come face-to-face with the massive queen and stave off her magic and pincer attacks. After killing the queen, they return to their normal size, destroying the hive as they grow, since the magic protecting the hive walls broke with the queen's death. Everywhere in the city, the worm spawn are dying and falling out of their hosts. Unfortunately, none of them recall them being under the influence of the spawn, so the group is still considered to be a band of fugitives. They are forced to escape the city, but they go with the knowledge and satisfaction that they saved everyone from the orcish invasion. Without the queen's leadership, the orcish horde fragments back into their warring tribes. Even though they still outnumber the alliance of elves, dwarves, and humans, they are no match for their combined might. The realms of Arkania are safe once again thanks to the group of heroes. But somewhere Borborad rages. He swears vengeance against all who managed to defeat his plans.\n\nThere is a side quest involving the disappearances of corpses from the city cemetery known as the Field of Boron. The group finds one freshly dug grave to be a fake which leads to a shapeshifter's quarters below ground. Upon killing the shapeshifter and its demon summon, there is information indicating the presence of a felimia, an elven vampire. This leads the party to another side quest to investigate the sewers where they run across a massive humanoid rat, the city's rat catcher, and an old slight hag. Upon further wandering through the sewers, the group runs into the city's secret underground resistance. There, the old hag suddenly displays inhuman powers as she grabs the nearest elf, kills him, then changes into a beautiful elven female sporting vampiric canines. The group finds out from different citizens that, the last time the city caught the felimia, they imprisoned her in a coffin buried in the Field of Boron. Digging up the coffin the group finds it empty with a hole in its bottom that leads to the shapeshifter's quarters. The felimia had bypassed the charms placed on the cover of the coffin by breaking through the bottom of the coffin. Later, the resistance contacts the party and tells them that, the last time they fought the felimia, they learned that Moonlight can kill the felimia. With the help of the resistance, the group finds the felimia's lair behind a magic mirror. Inside, they find a magically locked trunk that belonged to the resistance and open it with the password given to them. Inside is a moonlantern, moonstone, a cloak, and a magic dagger. The cloak turns out to be an invisibility cloak that allows the wearer to turn invisible to normal people but also bestows the ability to see the felimia. At this point, the resistance member dons the cloak, sees the invisible felimia standing right next to them in the room and attacks her with the dagger. He chases her into a room of mirrors. Finally, the group kills the felimia in the room of mirrors when they light the moonstone and place it into the lantern. The beam of the lantern rebounds off several mirrors until it strikes the felimia, which was charging at the group. The moonlight kills the felimia, reducing her to nothing in a brilliant flash of light. With this, the underground resistance is forever grateful to your group and later aids you when you are framed for murder.\n\nOut in the countryside, near the dwarven mines, there is a set of boots embedded in stone. When you grasp it, your party is transported to a mouthless cavern deep in the mountains. There you are confronted by a nameless warrior who wearing the set of boots. He acknowledges that you are after his magical boots. He tells you that he's been imprisoned there with the boots for ages and seeks death but can not die by his own hands. But as a warrior, he can not simply let you have the boots. He seeks to let you fight him for the boots. The boots enable him to have greater speed and range than any normal combatant. But you have the advantage of numbers against him. Upon killing him, he dies with a relieved smile and you are able to take the pair of boots from him.\n\nA side quest comes up when you investigate the sunken ship of Riva's harbor. The moment you walk about the water, your party is immediately attacked by a group of merpeople with tridents. After fighting them off, you encounter a second group of merpeople. If you decide not to attack this second group, they turn out to be friendly and take you to see the merking at their palace. The merking tells you that some of his people have been under some evil influence since the sinking of another ship in the harbor. He asks you to investigate and solve the problem. You can accept or reject this quest with no consequence to your primary quest of retrieving the urn. However, if you accept, the merking will also mention that his daughter feels that one in your party has an extreme attraction to her and would like to reciprocate the feelings. You can accept or reject this offer as well. If you accept, the merprincess will join the party which relieves you from more potential attacks by merpeople. Within the bowels the second sunken ship, you find the culprit is bottles of alcohol that line the supply room. You can choose to smash all the alcohol in the room. If you do, all attacks by enraged merpeople will stop. When you report back to the palace, the merking will mention that the merprincess and your party member feel even closer than before. He offers the party member a life under the sea in his court. If you accept, the party member with the greatest charisma will leave the group with the merprincess. If you refuse, the party will acknowledge that the current quest is more important and bid a fond farewell to the merfolk. In either case, the merprincess leaves the party as soon as you leave the water environment.\n\nAccording to \"Die Zeit\", all three games in the \"Realms of Arkania\" series, including \"Shadows over Riva\", were commercially and critically successful. \"Riva\" alone sold over 400,000 units by 2008. The paper's Nicole Lange reported in 2011 that the three \"Realms of Arkania\" entries together had surpassed 2.4 million sales worldwide.\n\nIn \"PC Gamer US\", Michael Wolf wrote, \"We roleplaying gamers are lucky — other RPGs slated for release this year will probably have better graphics, more intuitive interfaces, and more non-linear adventuring. But this one still has everything a real RPG fan could want.\" Steve Faragher of \"PC Gamer UK\" praised the game as a return to form for its genre, writing that it captured the \"good ol' role-playing feel that's so desperately unpopular with games designers today\".\n\nA reviewer for \"Next Generation\" criticized the game's reuse of combat mechanics and graphical assets from \"Star Trail\", but believed that \"the story line makes it all worth playing\". The writer concluded, \"Role-playing gamers will definitely be able to sink their teeth into this one.\" Robert Mayer of \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\" called the game \"a ray of sunlight for fantasy gamers\", and \"a winner, a solid statistics-based RPG in an era of lightweight imitations.\"\n\nIn \"Computer Gaming World\", Scorpia called \"Shadows over Riva\" \"yet another of those products that aggravate me more than outright turkeys\", due to the design of its final sequence and ending. However, she believed that the game was \"still manna for a CRPG-starved gaming public\", and worthwhile for those who overlooked its flaws. \"PC PowerPlay\"s David Wildgoose lauded the game as \"a cracking good adventure\" with \"great character interaction and conversation\", but found fault with its \"unnecessary\" reliance on statistics. Andy Backer of \"Computer Game Entertainment\" called \"Shadows over Riva\" a \"solid and satisfactory\" experience that fans of the genre \"will undoubtedly welcome ... with open arms.\"\n\n"}

He attended secondary school at Colégio D. Pedro II, and, on leaving school in 1924, was awarded the \"Pantheon\" prize, conferred on the best students of Colégio D. Pedro II. He went on to study medicine at the University of Brazil's National Faculty of Medicine (presently Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) from 1925. During his medical course, he studied pathology at the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz. After graduation, he worked from 1928 to 1929 at the Institute as a bacteriologist, having decided to specialize in scientific research in virology. For his achievements there, he received the Oswaldo Cruz Medal. As a result, he accepted an invitation to move to São Paulo in the next year and work at the Instituto Biológico (Biological Institute), an applied research center set up by the state government, in the section of bacteriology. Later, he studied at the Rockefeller Institute in New York City, United States, from 1935 to 1936.\n\nReturning to Brazil, Dr. Reis resumed his work at the Biological Institute. Under the instigation of the Institute's director, the German biologist Hermann von Ihering, to study a mysterious viral disease afflicting chicken producers in the state, he became gradually a renowned world expert on ornithopathology (avian diseases) and eventually was nominated director of the Institute. He felt also the urge to write pamphlets and booklets in a simple language, in order to instruct the agriculturists of the state on how to prevent and fight this and other diseases, and soon started to contribute regularly to a specialized magazine in this field, \"Chácaras & Quintais\".\n\nIn 1947, Dr. José Reis, who now displayed a marvelous talent for explaining scientific concepts for laypeople, started a parallel career as a journalist, first by writing a science column at one of the town's two most important newspapers, the Folha de S.Paulo. He maintained this column for the next 55 years, until shortly before his death, probably a world record for a science newspaper columnist. The column was syndicated to many other newspapers. He also dabbed in general journalism, and became one of the editors-in-chief at the Folha from 1962 to 1968, during the critical years of the military régime which was installed in April 1964 in Brazil.\n\nAs a scientific leader, Reis was exceedingly important for the history of Brazilian science and technology, as one of the founders of the Brazilian Society for the Advancement of Science (SBPC), in 1949, together with other important scientific personalities of the country, such as Jorge Americano, Paulo Sawaya, Maurício Rocha e Silva, Gastão Rosenfeld, Wilson Teixeira Beraldo, José Ribeiro do Vale and others . He was also the founder and the editor-in-chief for almost his entire life of \"Ciência e Cultura\", SBPC's official journal.\n\nReis received many national and international prizes, awards and honours, such as the Jonh R. Reitermeyer Award, granted by the Inter-American Press Society and the Panamerican Press Union in 1964; and the prestigious Kalinga Prize for the Popularization of Science by UNESCO (United Nations Organization for Education, Science and Culture). In his honour, the Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq) instituted in 1978 the José Reis Science Communication Award. His name is honoured also in the Núcleo José Reis de Divulgação Científica, a research and education centre at the School of Communication and Arts of the University of São Paulo.\n\nReis continued his work at Folha de S.Paulo until his death in São Paulo; he died of complications of multiple pneumonia in 2002, at 94 years of age. His latest work, \"Ética e Divulgação Científica: Os Desafios do Novo Século (Ethic and Cientific Divulgation: The Challenges of the New Century)\", fifth in the Science Popularization Series, was published in the same year.\n\n1935/36: Professor Thomas M. invites him for an internship at the Rockefeller Institute, In the United States.\n\n1936: Publishes the book Tratado de Ornipatologia (Treatise of Ornithopathology - bird diseases), in collaboration with Paulo Nóbrega and Annita Swenson Reis\n\n1941: J.

{"id": "2286329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2286329", "title": "Oriental City", "text": "Oriental City\n\nOriental City (previously Yaohan Plaza) was a shopping centre in Colindale, London, originally built as a luxury Japanese shopping centre by the Yaohan retail company of Japan. After Yaohan filed for bankruptcy in the late 1990s, the centre became a lower-end mall specialising in various oriental foods and items. Oriental City was located on Edgware Road, near Colindale tube station. It had a dedicated car park, and two floors. The complex was closed for redevelopment on 1 June 2008 and, after several changes of ownership, was demolished in August 2014.\n\nBetween December 2009 and April 2011, a complex similar to Oriental City traded in Wembley Retail Park, called Pacific Plaza.\n\nIn July 2017 the Bang Bang Oriental Food Hall opened on the site, comprising 32 food kiosks, massage and beauty therapy suites as well as shops and a cultural centre.\n\nYaohan Plaza was built as a Yaohan Shopping Centre, where it operated as a high-end Japanese shopping centre. After the Yaohan Corporation filed for bankruptcy in the late 1990s, it was sold to Malaysian owners, which was when it was renamed \"Oriental City\". Many locals and visitors still continued to refer to it as \"Yaohan Plaza\".\n\nAfter the centre was bought by Malaysian owners, it contained a large oriental supermarket, now relocated to Bayswater, and a food court with a range of foods from different areas of South-East Asia; stalls offered Malaysian, Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, Korean and Japanese foods including bento boxes and sushi, ramen noodles, and assorted Asian desserts. The food court was immensely popular with surrounding office workers and the North London community; and often became very crowded at weekends.\n\nThe food court was complemented by a number of oriental restaurants in the complex, with the majority of them located on the upper floor. The complex contained two Dim Sum restaurants, a Szechuan restaurant, and an 'all you can eat' restaurant. Outside, there was a durian stall and a satay stall.\n\nAside from the food outlets, the complex also contained a number of small shops and stalls. Over its history there was a high turnover of shops, with only one remaining original tenant in the facility, the Japanese tableware store, Utsuwa-No-Yataka. The centre also previously housed a shop selling video games and toys imported from Japan, a Sanrio boutique, and one of the largest Japanese bookshops in Europe, called . These have been closed down since 2003. In the period shortly before the centre closed down, shoppers could find a tailor's shop, a jeweller, a hairdresser, a beauty shop, Chinese medicine shops, a martial arts store, and a large furniture store. Oriental City was also host to a Sega Dome (Later Sega Park) arcade which has been a feature since the complex's opening in 1993. The arcade's outer façade was highly noticeable for the large picture of Sonic the Hedgehog attached to it, which had been on the complex since the early 1990s.\n\nIt also boasted one of the largest Oriental supermarkets in London; The only comparable supermarkets today would be Wing Yip and the Japan Centre in Regent Street.\n\nThe centre was a focal point for the Oriental community, often hosting weeks which promoted the cultural identity of different South East Asian countries. These events typically consisted of various performing arts, and the promotion of that country's particular cuisine.\n\nThe original Yaohan Plaza also featured a small example of a traditional Japanese garden outside the centre, which was allowed to fall into disrepair after the change of ownership.\n\nIn November 2006, Oriental City was bought out by the developer Development Securities who planned to demolish the centre and replace it with a B&Q, a housing development and a primary school. This private business transaction was beset by delays from store owners, the East Asian community, petitions, and even interference by the Chinese Consul-General and an ex-Arsenal football player. The developer was not able to close the complex until 2008, by which time the Great Recession had soured their ability to proceed with the redevelopment.\n\nIn 2006, the developers stated that there would be provisions for the current tenants of Oriental City to continue in the new development; however, the tenants objected to this, owing to the lack of consultation. Tenants stated that the new complex would take up to 9 years to complete, contrary to Development Securities' claim that redevelopment would take 3 years. Most tenants did not believe they could survive even a temporary relocation of their businesses.\n\nAside from business considerations, the East Asian community feared any redevelopment would mean the loss of an important community focal point. The tenants shut their businesses for a day to protest to the council at Brent Town Hall on 21 November 2006 feeling that they had been treated like 'second class citizens'. The tenants' plight was backed by a long-time visitor of the Centre, ex-Arsenal football player Ian Wright, who met the then London Mayor Ken Livingstone's planning officials in early December 2006 to object to the redevelopment plans.\n\nIn February 2007, the Chinese Consul-General wrote to London's mayor to express his \"deep concern\" about the project, calling for the proposal to be modified. Following a petition, it was announced that Oriental City would remain open until at least May 2008. The centre closed permanently at 7:00 pm on Sunday 1 June 2008, with thousands of people flocking to see Oriental City for the last time on its final day.\n\nOn 31 July 2008 Development Securities sold the site to a new developer, B & S Homes, for £68 million. The purchasers paid a £16 million deposit but were unable to find the £52 million required to complete their purchase. Their deposit was lost, the building went back into the hands of Development Securities, and further progress in the prevailing economic climate looked unlikely. As a result, the building remained boarded up and derelict.\n\nFrom early 2009, there was much talk amongst former tenants of a proposal to reopen the doors of Oriental City in its previous form later that year. Discussions were understood to be taking place between the owners and former tenants. In February 2010, former tenants of Oriental City held a protest at the site over the continued closure of the centre. A campaign to re-open the centre was initiated, and it was reported that Morrisons was interested in developing the site.\n\nIn May 2013, planning permission was granted for a full redevelopment of the site by Development Securities with Morrisons as an anchor tenant. In August 2014 the Oriental City building was demolished, and a new development including flats and a Morrisons Superstore was built on the location, the store opening in March 2016. Brent Council reserved the remaining part of the retail site for \"Far Eastern and Oriental uses\" only, incorporating 30,000 sq ft of restaurant space.

It is thought to be an amalgam of Creole and American Indian cultural influence, and the name is likely to derive from the French interpretation of the Native American name.\n\nIt contains corn, green bell pepper, onion, and sometimes garlic, celery, and tomato. The ingredients are braised in a pot. Historically bacon grease was used for the braising stage, although various combinations of oil, butter, or cream may be substituted. The vegetables are then left to simmer until they reach a tender consistency, with chicken stock or water added as necessary. The dish is finished with salt and a combination of red and black pepper. Some cooks include hot sauce and a bit of sugar for greater complexity.\n\nMaque choux is usually served as an accompaniment; however, it can also act as a base for a main meal and use local ingredients such as bite-sized portions of chicken or crawfish. Shrimp is often added in the later stages of cooking as well.\n\n"}
{"id": "2286339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2286339", "title": "Teano", "text": "Teano\n\nTeano (Teanese: ) is a town and \"comune\" in the province of Caserta, Campania, southern Italy, northwest of Caserta on the main line to Rome from Naples. It stands at the southeast foot of an extinct volcano, Rocca Monfina. Its St. Clement's cathedral is the see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Teano-Calvi, which started as Diocese of Teano circa AD 300.\n\nThe ancient Teanum Sidicinum was the capital of the Oscan tribe of the Sidicini, which drove the Aurunci from Roccamonfina. They probably submitted to Rome in 334 BC and their troops were grouped with those of Campania in the Roman army. Thus the garrison of Regium, which in 280 attacked the citizens, consisted of one cohort of Sidicini and two of Campanians. Like Cales, Teanum continued to have the right of coinage, and, like Suessa and Cales, remained faithful to Rome in both the Hannibalic and the Social wars. Its position gave it some military importance, and it was apparently made a colony by Claudius, not by Augustus. Strabo speaks of it as the most important town on the Via Latina, joined by a branch road from Suessa, of which remains still exist, and which continued east to Alife.\n\nIn the 4th century Teano became seat of a diocese, and was later an important Lombard county, as part of the Duchy of Benevento. The Benedictines had several properties in the city, where the monks from Montecassino took refuge when their abbey was destroyed in 883. Here one of the first document of \"vulgare\" Italian was issued in 963.\n\nTeano was the site of the famous meeting of 26 October 1860, between Italian nationalist fighter Giuseppe Garibaldi and Victor Emanuel II, the King of Sardinia. Having wrested the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies from the Neapolitan Bourbons, Garibaldi shook Victor Emanuel's hand and hailed him as King of Italy. Thus, Garibaldi sacrificed republican hopes for the sake of Italian unity under a monarchy. The event is a popular subject for Italian patriotic statues and paintings.\n\nOther sights include:\n\nTeano is from the gate of Capua of A1 Milan-Naples highway. It can be also reached by road through SS.7 Via Appia and SS.6 Via Casilina. The city is also served by a railway station.\n\n\n<br>\n"}

{"id": "2286376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2286376", "title": "Nandrolone decanoate", "text": "Nandrolone decanoate\n\nNandrolone decanoate, sold under the brand name Deca-Durabolin among others, is an androgen and anabolic steroid (AAS) medication which is used primarily in the treatment of anemias and wasting syndromes, as well as osteoporosis in menopausal women. It is given by injection into muscle or fat once every one to four weeks.\nSide effects of nandrolone decanoate may include symptoms of masculinization like acne, increased hair growth, voice changes, and increased sexual desire. The medication is a synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid and hence is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It has strong anabolic effects and weak androgenic effects, which give it a mild side effect profile and make it especially suitable for use in women and children. Nandrolone decanoate is a nandrolone ester and a long-lasting prodrug of nandrolone in the body.\nNandrolone decanoate was first described in 1960 and was introduced for medical use in 1962. It was the second nandrolone ester to be introduced, following nandrolone phenylpropionate (NPP) in 1959, and is one of the most widely used nandrolone esters. It is also one of the most widely used AAS worldwide. In addition to its medical use, nandrolone decanoate is used to improve physique and performance, and is said to be the most widely used AAS for such purposes. The drug is a controlled substance in many countries and so non-medical use is generally illicit.\n\nNandrolone decanoate is approved in the United States specifically for the treatment of anemia of chronic kidney disease and in the United Kingdom specifically for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. In Australia, it is approved specifically for the treatment of kidney failure, chronic kidney disease, anemia of kidney failure, aplastic anemia, osteoporosis (in women in whom estrogens are contraindicated), inoperable breast cancer, and for patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy. In New Zealand, it is approved for osteoporosis, inoperable breast cancer, and as an adjunct to therapy for conditions characterized by a negative nitrogen balance. The drug is often used off-label to preserve lean mass in HIV/AIDS patients and in other wasting syndromes.\n\nIn the past, nandrolone decanoate has also been indicated and used for a variety of other conditions and situations including pre- and postoperative use for increasing lean mass, treating weight loss due to convalescence or disease, geriatric states (e.g., general weakness, fatigue), burns, severe trauma, ulcers, and selected cases of growth failure in children. Starting in the 1970s, the indications of nandrolone decanoate were refined and use of the drug became more selective and restricted. Its use in medicine continues to decline and has become limited, with its sale having been discontinued in many countries.\n\nNandrolone esters can be used as a form of androgen replacement therapy for treatment of androgen deficiency in men. However, they have not generally been used for this purpose, and have instead mostly been used only as anabolic agents. In any case, nandrolone decanoate has widely been used at low doses as a means of androgen replacement in postmenopausal women, for instance to maintain or increase bone mineral density and decrease the risk of osteoporosis. It is one of only three androgens approved for androgen replacement in postmenopausal women, the others being testosterone (and esters) and methyltestosterone. Nandrolone esters have more recently been proposed for more widespread treatment of androgen deficiency in men due to favorable properties including their high ratio of anabolic to androgenic effect and hence lower or negligible risk of scalp hair loss, prostate enlargement, and prostate cancer relative to testosterone. Nandrolone esters and related compounds such as trestolone and dimethandrolone undecanoate have also been studied as means of androgen replacement in investigational male contraceptive regimens.\n\nA dosage of nandrolone decanoate of 25 to 50 mg once every 6 to 12 weeks (working out to an average exposure of about 2 to 8 mg per week) by intramuscular injection is considered to be appropriate for general androgen replacement therapy in women. A dosage of 50 mg once every 2 to 4 weeks by intramuscular injection is used in the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and in the palliative treatment of inoperative breast cancer. For children aged 2 to 13 years, the average dosage for anemia of chronic kidney disease is 25 to 50 mg every 3 to 4 weeks by intramuscular injection. Dosages in men and for other uses have also been described.\n\nNandrolone decanoate has been available in 25 mg/mL, 50 mg/mL, 100 mg/mL, and 200 mg/mL formulations in oil solution for intramuscular injection.\n\nNandrolone decanoate is used for physique- and performance-enhancing purposes by competitive athletes, bodybuilders, and powerlifters. It is one of the most popular injectable AAS worldwide, and nandrolone esters have been said to be the most popular AAS used by bodybuilders and in sports. This is in part due to the high ratio of anabolic to androgenic effect of nandrolone and its weak propensity for androgenic and estrogenic side effects.\n\nContraindications for nandrolone decanoate include pregnancy, breastfeeding, prostate cancer, male breast cancer, breast cancer in women with hypercalcemia, hypersensitivity (to nandrolone decanoate or excipients such as arachis (peanut) oil; includes those with peanut and soy allergies), nephrosis or nephritis, liver disease with impaired bilirubin excretion, and heart failure. High dosages may also be considered contraindicated in women due to their high potential for virilization.\n\nThe side effects of nandrolone decanoate are dependent on dosage, duration of treatment, and individual sensitivity. A number of common, uncommon, and rare side effects have been observed with the medication at recommended dosages. While less common or severe than with many other AAS, the most common side effect of nandrolone decanoate is virilization (masculinization) in women. Uncommon side effects of nandrolone decanoate at recommended dosages include fluid retention, inhibition of spermatogenesis, testicular atrophy, erectile dysfunction, gynecomastia, increased frequency of penile erections, increased penis size in pre-pubertal boys, clitoral hypertrophy, increased pubic hair growth, oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, hyperlipidemia, decreased HDL cholesterol, increased hemoglobin (to abnormal high levels), hypertension, nausea, epididymitis, bladder irritability, reduced urine flow, benign prostatic hyperplasia, priapism, premature epiphyseal closure (in children), and acne. Rare side effects include abnormal liver function, jaundice, peliosis hepatis, liver tumors, oily skin, greasy hair, rash, pruritus, exanthema, urticaria at the injection site, and furunculosis. Local injection site reactions may also occur.\n\nUnlike 17α-alkylated AAS such as methyltestosterone, nandrolone decanoate is not associated with liver toxicity.\n\nNandrolone decanoate causes virilization as a common side effect in women, including acne, hoarseness of the voice, hirsutism (excessive facial/body hair growth), and libido changes, among others. Clitoral enlargement is an uncommon symptom of virilization that can occur. Virilization is especially prevalent and marked at high dosages of nandrolone decanoate and/or with long-term treatment, and some aspects of virilization like voice deepening can be irreversible. Hoarseness is often the first sign of voice changes. Although said to be only slightly androgenic, nandrolone decanoate may still occasionally cause virilization at recommended dosages in women, especially with long-term treatment. A minor though statistically insignificant incidence of virilization has been observed in women treated with nandrolone decanoate short-term at a dosage of 100 mg every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. Conversely, long-term (>1 year) studies have shown significant virilization in women even at a dosage of 50 mg every 2 or 3 weeks.\n\nThe acute toxicity of nandrolone esters in animals and donkeys is very low and there are no reports of acute overdosage with nandrolone decanoate in humans. There are no specific recommendations for the management of nandrolone decanoate.\n\nAntiestrogens like aromatase inhibitors (e.g., anastrozole) and selective estrogen receptor modulators (e.g., tamoxifen, raloxifene) can interfere with and prevent the estrogenic effects of nandrolone decanoate. 5α-Reductase inhibitors like finasteride and dutasteride can prevent the inactivation of nandrolone in so-called \"androgenic\" tissues like the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland, and may therefore considerably increase its androgenic side effects. This is opposite to the case of most other AAS, which are either potentiated by 5α-reductase in such tissues or are not substrates of 5α-reductase. Antiandrogens like cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, and bicalutamide can block both the anabolic and androgenic effects of AAS like nandrolone decanoate.\n\nNandrolone decanoate is a nandrolone ester, or a prodrug of nandrolone. As such, it is an androgen and anabolic steroid, or an agonist of the AR, the biological target of androgens like testosterone and DHT. Relative to testosterone, nandrolone decanoate has enhanced anabolic effects and reduced androgenic effects. It is considered to have strong anabolic effects but weak androgenic effects, with respective potency ratios of 3.29–4.92 and 0.31–0.41 (index value 10.6–12.1 or about an 11:1 ratio of myotrophic to androgenic effect) relative to testosterone propionate. This is defined specifically on the basis of a rodent model in which change in the weights of the rat bulbocavernosus/levator ani muscle (\"anabolic\" or \"myotrophic\" activity) and the rat ventral prostate or seminal vesicles (\"androgenic\" activity) are compared with testosterone and then used to form a ratio. Along with oxandrolone (which has a ratio of about 10:1), nandrolone esters are thought to have the highest ratio of anabolic to androgenic effect of any other AAS. For this reason, they are considered to be among the most appropriate AAS for use in women and children.\n\nAndrogenic effects like virilization are relatively uncommon with nandrolone decanoate at recommended dosages, though may still occur especially at higher dosages or with extended use. The low androgenicity of nandrolone decanoate is thought to be due to the fact that whereas many other AAS like testosterone are potentiated via transformation by 5α-reductase into more potent AR agonists like DHT in specific tissues including the skin, hair follicles, prostate gland, liver, and brain, nandrolone is instead inactivated by 5α-reductase via transformation into the low-affinity AR ligand 5α-dihydronandrolone in such tissues. This is thought to result in a much lower incidence and magnitude of facial/body hair growth, scalp hair loss, and possibly prostate issues like prostate enlargement and prostate cancer with nandrolone esters relative to testosterone.\n\nIn addition to its anabolic and androgenic activity, nandrolone decanoate has low estrogenic activity (via its metabolite estradiol) and moderate progestogenic activity. This may result in side effects such as fluid retention and gynecomastia. Like other AAS, nandrolone decanoate has antigonadotropic effects. It has been found to suppress testosterone levels by 57% at a dosage of 100 mg/week and by 70% at a dosage of 300 mg/week in men following 6 weeks of treatment. Both the androgenic activity and the progestogenic activity of nandrolone decanoate may contribute to its antigonadotropic potency. Relative to testosterone, due to its lower estrogenic potency, much less of the antigonadotropic potency of nandrolone decanoate is derived from its estrogenic activity.\n\nUpon intramuscular injection in oil, which results in the formation of a long-lasting depot in the muscle, nandrolone decanoate is stored unchanged and is slowly absorbed into the body. Once in the circulation, it is converted into nandrolone, which is the active form of the drug. There is a sharp spike in nandrolone levels 24 to 48 hours after an intramuscular injection of nandrolone decanoate, followed by a steady decline to baseline levels within approximately two or three weeks. The bioavailability of nandrolone decanoate is 53 to 73% with intramuscular injection and varies with the site of injection, with the highest bioavailability seen when injected into the gluteal muscle. Like testosterone, nandrolone is highly protein-bound and is present in the blood in both bound and free fractions. It has very low affinity for sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), about 5% of that of testosterone and 1% of that of DHT.\n\nNandrolone decanoate is rapidly hydrolyzed in the blood by esterases into nandrolone, with a terminal half-life of one hour or less. It does not appear to be hydrolyzed in muscle or fat. The metabolism of nandrolone occurs in the liver and is very similar to that of testosterone, including reduction by 5α-reductase and 5β-reductase, dehydrogenation by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and conjugation. The metabolites of nandrolone include 5α-dihydronandrolone, 19-norandrosterone, and 19-noretiocholanolone, with 19-norandrosterone being the major metabolite. Other metabolites include 19-norandrostenedione, 19-norandrostanediols, 19-norepiandrosterone, and conjugates. Nandrolone also undergoes aromatization into estradiol similarly to testosterone, though at a rate of only about 20% of that of testosterone or possibly even less; one study found virtually no aromatization of nandrolone in men.\n\nThe elimination half-life of nandrolone decanoate administered by intramuscular injection is approximately 6 to 12 days. Studies that have assessed the duration of nandrolone decanoate via its anabolic effects, for instance on nitrogen balance, have found that a single 50 to 100 mg intramuscular injection had a duration of about 18 to 25 days. The blood half-life for the combined process of hydrolysis into nandrolone and elimination of nandrolone is 4.3 hours. Nandrolone and its metabolites are excreted in the urine, mainly in the form of conjugates.\n\nAlthough nandrolone decanoate is usually administered by intramuscular injection, it has been found to be similarly effective when administered by subcutaneous injection. The pharmacokinetics of nandrolone decanoate via subcutaneous injection closely resemble those of intramuscular injection. However, subcutaneous injection is considered to be easier, more convenient, and less painful compared to intramuscular injection. In addition, research suggests that most intramuscular injections in practice are in fact subcutaneous injections.\n\nNandrolone decanoate, or nandrolone 17β-decanoate, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is an androgen ester; specifically, it is the C17β decylate (decanoate) ester of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone), which itself is the 19-demethylated analogue of testosterone.\n\nNandrolone decanoate was first described in the literature in 1960. It was developed by Organon and was introduced for medical use under the brand name Deca-Durabolin in 1962. Shortly thereafter it became one of the most widely used AAS in the world. Nandrolone decanoate was the second form of nandrolone to be introduced, having been preceded by nandrolone phenylpropionate in 1959.\n\n\"Nandrolone decanoate\" is the generic name of the drug and its and . It has also been referred to as \"nandrolone decylate\".\n\nNandrolone decanoate is or has been marketed under the brand names Deca-Durabolin, Deca-Durabol, Decaneurabol, Metadec, and Retabolil, among others.\n\nNandrolone decanoate is available widely throughout the world, including in the United Kingdom, other European countries, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, Asia, and elsewhere in the world. It has been discontinued in United States and Canada. Its availability is becoming increasingly limited with time.\n\nNandrolone decanoate, along with other AAS, is a schedule III controlled substance in the United States under the Controlled Substances Act.\n\nNandrolone decanoate has been studied in the treatment of bone loss in men, but in contrast to testosterone esters, was found to be ineffective. In short-term (6- to 8-week) studies in healthy male bodybuilders, nandrolone decanoate did not alter bone mineral density. However, the short duration of these studies limits conclusions on the influence of nandrolone decanoate on bone in men.\n\n\n"}

Interrupt storms are typically caused by hardware devices that do not support interrupt rate limiting.\n\nBecause interrupt processing is typically a non-preemptible task in time-sharing operating systems, an interrupt storm will cause sluggish response to user input, or even appear to freeze the system completely. This state is commonly known as \"live lock\". In such a state, the system is spending most of its resources processing interrupts instead of completing other work. To the end-user, it does not appear to be processing anything at all as there is often no output. An interrupt storm is sometimes mistaken for thrashing, since they both have similar symptoms (unresponsive or sluggish response to user input, little or no output).\n\nCommon causes include: misconfigured or faulty hardware, faulty device drivers, flaws in the operating system, or metastability in one or more components. The latter condition rarely occurs outside of prototype or amateur-built hardware.\n\nMost modern hardware and operating systems have methods for mitigating the effect of an interrupt storm. For example, most Ethernet controllers implement interrupt \"rate limiting\", which causes the controller to wait a programmable amount of time between each interrupt it generates. When not present within the device, similar functionality is usually written into the device driver, and/or the operating system itself.\n\nThe most common cause is when a device \"behind\" another signals an interrupt to an APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller). Most computer peripherals generate interrupts through an APIC as the number of interrupts is most always less (typically 15 for the modern PC) than the number of devices. The OS must then query each driver registered to that interrupt to ask if the interrupt originated from its hardware. Faulty drivers may always claim \"yes\", causing the OS to not query other drivers registered to that interrupt (only one interrupt can be processed at a time). The device which originally requested the interrupt therefore does not get its interrupt serviced, so a new interrupt is generated (or is not cleared) and the processor becomes swamped with continuous interrupt signals. Any operating system can live lock under an interrupt storm caused by such a fault. A kernel debugger can usually break the storm by unloading the faulty driver, allowing the driver \"underneath\" the faulty one to clear the interrupt, if user input is still possible.\n\nAs drivers are most often implemented by a 3rd party, most operating systems also have a polling mode that queries for pending interrupts at fixed intervals or in a round-robin fashion. This mode can be set globally, on a per-driver, per-interrupt basis, or dynamically if the OS detects a fault condition or excessive interrupt generation. A polling mode may be enabled dynamically when the number of interrupts or the resource use caused by an interrupt, passes certain thresholds. When these thresholds are no longer exceeded, an OS may then change the interrupting driver, interrupt, or interrupt handling globally, from an interrupt mode to a polling mode. Interrupt rate limiting in hardware usually negates the use of a polling mode, but can still happen during normal operation during intense I/O if the processor is unable switch contexts quickly enough to keep pace.\n\nPerhaps the first interrupt storm occurred during the Apollo 11's lunar descent in 1969.\n\nInterrupt rate limiting must be carefully configured for optimum results. For example, an Ethernet controller with interrupt rate limiting will buffer the packets it receives from the network in between each interrupt. If the rate is set too low, the controller's buffer will overflow, and packets will be dropped. The rate must take into account how fast the buffer may fill between interrupts, and the interrupt latency between the interrupt and the transfer of the buffer to the system.\n\nThere are hardware-based and software-based approaches to the problem. For example, FreeBSD detects interrupt storms and masks problematic interrupts for some time in response.\n\nThe system used by NAPI is an example of the hardware-based approach: the system (driver) starts in interrupt enabled state, and the Interrupt handler then disables the interrupt and lets a thread/task handle the event(s) and then task polls the device, processing some number of events and enabling the interrupt.\n\nAnother interesting approach using hardware support is one where the device generates interrupt when the event queue state changes from \"empty\" to \"not empty\". Then, if there are no free DMA descriptors at the RX FIFO tail, the device drops the event. The event is then added to the tail and the FIFO entry is marked as occupied. If at that point entry (tail−1) is free (cleared), an interrupt will be generated (level interrupt) and the tail pointer will be incremented. If the hardware requires the interrupt be acknowledged, the CPU (interrupt handler) will do that, handle the valid DMA descriptors at the head, and return from the interrupt.\n\n"}

Superbases are valuable in organic chemistry, which abounds in very weak acids. Reactions involving superbases often require special techniques since they're easily destroyed by water, atmospheric carbon dioxide, and, often, oxygen. A common superbase is lithium diisopropylamide.\n\nA \"superbase\" has been defined as an organic compound whose basicity is greater than that of proton sponge, which has a conjugate pKa of 12.1. Strong superbases can be prepared from extending the hydrogen bond network of multiple amino groups substituted on an aromatic core. Superbases are of great interest to practicing organic chemists due to their reactivity as well as good solubility in organic solvents. \n\nIUPAC broadly defines a superbase as a \"compound having a very high basicity, such as lithium diisopropylamide.\" Caubère defines superbases as \"bases resulting from a mixing of two (or more) bases leading to new basic species possessing inherent new properties. The term \"superbase\" does not mean a base is thermodynamically and/or kinetically stronger than another, instead it means that a basic reagent is created by combining the characteristics of several different bases.\"\n\nSuperbases have also been defined semi-quantitatively as any species with a higher absolute proton affinity (APA = 245.3 kcal/mol) and intrinsic gas phase basicity (GB = 239 kcal/mol) than Alder's canonical proton sponge (1,8-bis-(dimethylamino)-naphthalene).\n\nSuperbases have been described and used since the 1850s. \n\nOrganic superbases are almost always charge-neutral, amine-containing species. Despite enormous proton affinity, some organosuperbases exhibit low nucleophilicity. Increasingly important in organic synthesis, these include the phosphazenes, amidines, and guanidines. Other organic compounds also meet the physicochemical or structural definitions of 'superbase'. Proton chelators like the aromatic proton sponges and the bispidines are also superbases. Multicyclic polyamines, like DABCO might also be loosely included in this category.\n\nOrganometallic compounds of electropositive metals are superbases, but they are generally strong nucleophiles. Examples include organolithium and organomagnesium (Grignard reagent) compounds. Another type of organometallic superbase has a reactive metal exchanged for a hydrogen on a heteroatom, such as oxygen (unstabilized alkoxides) or nitrogen (metal amides such as lithium diisopropylamide). \n\nThe Schlosser base (or Lochmann-Schlosser base), the combination of \"n\"-butyllithium and potassium \"tert\"-butoxide, is commonly cited as a superbase. \"n\"-Butyllithium and potassium \"tert\"-butoxide form a mixed aggregate of greater reactivity than either component reagent.\n\nInorganic superbases are typically salt-like compounds with small, highly charged anions, e.g. lithium hydride, potassium hydride, and sodium hydride. Such species are insoluble, but the surfaces of these materials are highly reactive and slurries are useful in synthesis.\n\nSuperbases are used in organocatalysis.\n\nThe list of the strongest superbases as ranked by their calculated gas phase basicity (proton affinity) is given below.\n\n\n"}

It was a finalist for the National Book Award in 1962, along with \"Catch-22\" and \"The Moviegoer\". When published by Atlantic-Little, Brown in 1961, it received critical acclaim, and \"The New York Times\" reviewed it as \"beautifully crafted... a remarkable and deeply troubling book.\" In 2005, the novel was chosen by \"TIME\" as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to the present.\n\nWhen DeWitt Henry and Geoffrey Clark interviewed Yates for the Winter 1972 issue of literary journal \"Ploughshares\", Yates detailed the title's subtext:\n\nA film adaptation of the book, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, and Kathy Bates, directed by Sam Mendes, and written by Justin Haythe, was released in 2008.\n\nSet in 1955, the novel focuses on the hopes and aspirations of Frank and April Wheeler, self-assured Connecticut suburbanites who see themselves as very different from their neighbors in the Revolutionary Hill Estates. In the opening scene, April stars in an embarrassingly bad amateur dramatic production of \"The Petrified Forest\". After the performance, Frank and April have a fight on the side of the highway, and Frank later begins an affair with his office colleague Maureen Grube.\n\nSeeking to break out of their suburban rut (and consequently blaming herself for all of Frank's \"problems\"), April convinces Frank they should move to Paris, where she will work and support him while he realizes his vague ambition to be something other than an office worker. The promise of France brings the two together in love and excitement again, and Frank seemingly ends his relationship with Maureen. While April sees the emigration as an opportunity to escape their bland environment, Frank's plans are more driven by vanity of his own intelligence, which April panders to. When the dull and prim neighbor Mrs. Givings begins bringing her \"insane\" son John around to the Wheelers' house for regular lunches, John's honest and erratic condemnation of his mother's suburban lifestyle strikes a chord with the Wheelers, particularly Frank.\n\nTheir plans to leave the United States begin to crumble when April conceives their third child, and Frank begins to identify with his mundane job when the prospect of a promotion arises. After arguing over the possibility of aborting the child, Frank tries to manipulate April into seeking psychiatric help for her troubled childhood. April, overwhelmed by the situation, suffers something of an identity crisis and sleeps with her neighbor Shep Campbell, while Frank resurrects his relationship with Maureen. April attempts to self-abort her child, and in doing so is rushed to the hospital and dies from blood loss. Frank, scarred by the ordeal and feeling deep guilt over the outcome, is left a hollow shell of a man. He and his children spent time living with their uncle, hence mirroring the youth of their mother.\n\nIn the October 1999 issue of the \"Boston Review\", Yates was quoted on his central theme: \"If my work has a theme, I suspect it is a simple one: that most human beings are inescapably alone, and therein lies their tragedy.\" For all their personal hopes and dreams, Frank and April are unable to communicate them to each other; this syndrome is also seen in the other characters, Shep and Milly Campbell, and Mr. and Mrs. Givings. The Wheelers' frustrations and yearnings for something better represent the tattered remnants of the American Dream.\n\nStewart O'Nan probed the neglect of Yates in \"The Lost World of Richard Yates: How the Great Writer of the Age of Anxiety Disappeared from Print\".\nWilliam Styron, who once gave a reading of the novel's opening chapter at Boston University, called \"Revolutionary Road\" \"a deft, ironic, beautiful novel that deserves to be a classic.\"\n\nKurt Vonnegut called it \"\"The Great Gatsby\" of my time... one of the best books by a member of my generation.\"\n\nTennessee Williams also praised the book: \"Here is more than fine writing; here is what, added to fine writing, makes a book come immediately, intensely and brilliantly alive. If more is needed to make a masterpiece in modern American fiction, I am sure I don't know what it is.\"\n\nScreenwriter Justin Haythe adapted the novel for filming, which was directed by Sam Mendes, stars Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, and co-stars Kathy Bates. It opened December 26, 2008 to generally favorable reviews.\n\n"}

He was a member of the Bundestag from 1972 to 2002. He served as Federal Minister of Finance of Germany in the Cabinet of Chancellor Helmut Kohl from 1989 to 1998, and as Chairman of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria from 1988 to 1999. He is known as the father of the Euro, the European currency. He played a vital role in its introduction as German Minister of Finance. He also managed to impose an austerity program on West Germans and overcome the massive deficits of German unification to meet the strict fiscal benchmarks mandated by Europe's single currency. In 2009, he was appointed Honorary Chairman of the CSU.\n\nWaigel was born as the son of a small-time farmer from the Swabian village of Oberrohr. When he was 6, his older brother, August, was killed in France during World War 2.\n\nWaigel first became a Member of the German Bundestag in the 1972 federal elections. From 1980 to 1982, he served as spokesperson of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group on economic affairs. He was the group's deputy chairman from 1982 until 1989. In this capacity, he also served as the leader of the Bundestag group of CSU parliamentarians.\n\nIn a 1989 cabinet reshuffle, Chancellor Helmut Kohl named Waigel as new Federal Minister of Finance, replacing Gerhard Stoltenberg. During his time in office, his state secretaries included leading economists Horst Köhler (1990-1993) and Jürgen Stark (1995-1998), among others.\n\nDuring his time in office, Waigel oversaw the early economic integration of East Germany after the fall of Communism. He not only had to impose enormous new taxes on the German public, but he also had to keep the country's budget deficit from ballooning while Germany was spending $150 billion a year to rebuild the east.\n\nIn March 1990, Waigel publicly announced that his Government's policy was considering a proposal by its central bank, the Bundesbank, for conversion at a rate of one Deutsche mark for every two East marks, with an exception for a small portion of personal savings. In response, hundreds of thousands of East Germans to protest the plan, including about 10,000 in East Berlin, who took to the Palace of the Republic, where the newly elected Parliament was holding its inaugural meeting. Chancellor Helmut Kohl said that was not the policy after all.\n\nOn 19 May 1990, Waigel and his East German counterpart Walter Romberg signed a state treaty to merge their economies and make the West German mark the sole legal currency in both nations by 2 July 1990.\n\nIn July 1990, Waigel joined Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher on a trip to Moscow for meeting President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, where both worked to convince the Soviet leader to drop his remaining objections to German unification within NATO.\n\nOn 9 August 1990, Waigel announced that West Germany's 1990 budget would be its last and that he was withdrawing the Cabinet draft for the 1991 budget to make way for an all-German budget consonant with unification. Later that year, he said that borrowing by Government, state and local authorities would total up to $95 billion the following year, nearly five times the equivalent figure for West Germany in 1989. Between 1989 and 1991 alone, the central government's budget deficit soared from 0.5 percent of national income to 5 percent.\n\nFollowing a proposal developed by Waigel, the Kohl government agreed in February 1991 to an unexpectedly large package of tax increases – including a 7.5 percent surcharge on personal income and corporate tax payments – to help pay for reunification, as well as the governments's contribution to the allied forces during the Gulf War and aid to Eastern Europe's fledgling democracies. In March 1992, Germany paid its final installment of $1.68 billion in Gulf War aid to the United States, fulfilling its overal pledge of $5.5 billion.\n\nIn the national debate on whether the federal Government should remain in Bonn or move to Berlin, Waigel argued Germany had assumed enough major financial obligations over the preceding years and could not afford to build a new capital.\n\nIn early 1996, Waigel and his French counterpart Jean Arthuis launched a French-German economic stimulus package aimed at encouraging spending, increasing growth, cutting taxes on business and reducing unemployment. In the subsequent years, however, both CDU and CSU favored increasing taxes, fearing the consequences of further budgetary cuts; by 1997, the government was already in danger of breaking a Constitutional Court ruling that spending on public investment must exceed the budget deficit. At the time, Germany had a record 2.2 trillion marks in public debt, much of it amassed during Waigel's tenure because of the costs of reunification.\n\nDuring the period of Reunification in the 1990s, Theo Waigel as Minister of Finance, refused to return 8 buildings in East Germany belonging to 6 Austrian Jewish citizens. \"[[Allgemeine Judische Wochenzeitung, September 10th, 1992; \"Expropriation through the Back door\" (Enteignung durch die Hintertur).\n\nSoon after taking office, Waigel negotiated with his counterparts of the [[Group of Seven (G7)|G7]] on the difficult question of rankings in the voting hierarchy of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). Under the agreement, Japan and West Germany shared the No. 2 ranking at the agency, ahead of France and the United Kingdom. By 1991, Waigel was the driving force within the G7 to agree in principle that the Soviet Union should be offered a role in the IMF.\n\nIn 1991, Waigel became the first chairman of the board of the newly established [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD).\n\nOn initiative of Waigel, the Bundestag establied the German Federal Environmental Foundation (DBU) in 1990, using the amount of €1.3 billion from privatizing the former steel group [[Salzgitter AG]].\n\nAfter Germany and France failed to get the [[18th G7 summit]] to agree on ways to assure the safety of deteriorating nuclear power plants in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, Waigel pledged that public funds from the West would nonetheless be mobilized not simply to repair dangerous plants but \"to change the whole energy policy in these states so they can conserve energy, develop alternative energy sources and thereby create more leeway for shutting down plants that are unsafe.\"\n\nUnder the leadership of Kohl and Waigel, the adoption of a common currency became central to Germany's goals of political and economic integration in Europe.\n\nAt the height of speculative attacks on the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) in 1992-93, acting closely with his then counterpart [[Michel Sapin]] of France, Waigel repulsed speculators trying to break the [[French franc]]'s parity with the [[Deutsche Mark]] by selling marks en masse until the bank traders gave up.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Waigel was seeking to assure a skeptical German public as well as small companies and banks that the new currency would be as stable as the Deutsche Mark, which had become a symbol of Germany's economic hegemony in Europe at the time. In September 1995, Waigel first proposed that countries adopting a single currency agree to reinforce rules on budget deficits and impose financial sanctions against deficit violators that go beyond the penalties included in the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. Also in September 1995, Waigel first floated Euro as the name of the new single currency. He later overruled the French government with his proposal; France had favored want the name ECU, the [[European Currency Unit]] which was used in many accounts and the issuance of some debt at the time. The name \"Euro\" was later chosen for the new currency at the European Council in Madrid.\n\nIn a move to reduce government spending, Waigel led the call for a reduction in Germany's contributions to the [[budget of the European Union]] in 1996. He wrote to Kohl pointing out that contributions from Germany made up about 60 percent of the [[Regional policy of the European Union|EU's regional and structural funds]] and urging him to push for a cut in Germany's burden. In 1998, he joined fellow finance ministers [[Gerrit Zalm]] of the [[Netherlands]], [[Rudolf Edlinger]] of [[Austria]] and [[Erik Åsbrink]] of [[Sweden]] urging [[President of the European Commission]] [[Jacques Santer]] to cap the proportion of a country's income which goes to the EU as part of his [[Agenda 2000]] spending review.\n\nAfter his failed attempt to pressure [[Bundesbank]] president [[Hans Tietmeyer]] into a quick revaluation of the country's [[gold reserve]]s in order to bring Germany's budget deficit into line with the criteria for the single currency, Waigel had to confront a parliamentary motion against him on 4 June 1997. He won the vote by just 328 votes to 311.\n\nIn November 1997, Waigel imposed the strictest [[budget freeze]] in the country's history, in a last-ditch effort to fulfill the [[Euro convergence criteria]]. The freeze, which lasted until the end of that year, was imposed to save the government a further one billion marks ($578.2 million).\n\nOn 30 June 1998, Waigel attended the inauguration ceremony of the [[European Central Bank]] in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, alongside Kohl, ECB President [[Wim Duisenberg]], [[President of the European Commission]] [[Jacques Santer]], [[President of the European Parliament]] [[José María Gil-Robles]], British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], and [[Chancellor of Austria]] [[Viktor Klima]].\n\nIn 2011, a commentator seeing Germany forced perhaps to choose between monetary stability, on the one hand, and the [[European Monetary Union|EMU]], recalled by way of contrast Waigel's statement at the founding, “We are bringing the D-Mark into Europe.”\n\nIn May 1993, Waigel announced that we would leave national politics and run for the state premiership of Bavaria against his rival, [[Edmund Stoiber]]. During what turned into a bitter struggle, it was revealed that he was estranged from his wife and had been in a long-standing relationship with former Olympic skier Irene Epple. In the end, he failed to win the premiership but stayed on as party leader. In late 1995, Waigel was e-elected to the CSU leadership with 95 percent of the vote.\n\nFollowing the [[1998 German federal election|1998 elections]], Waigel was succeeded by [[Oscar Lafontaine]]. At the time, he was Germany's longest-serving postwar Finance Minister.\n\nBy the end of the 1990s, Waigel and Minister-President Stoiber of Bavaria were locked in a bitter rivalry for control of the state and its ruling party, the CSU. Stoiber had been a vociferous critic of the creation of a single European currency and he has also infuriated both Kohl and Waigel by proposing that wealthy states like Bavaria be freed from having to underwrite social security costs for poorer states. In late 1998, Stoiber succeeded Waigel as chairman of the CSU.\n\nSince his retirement from German and European politics, Waigel has held paid and unpaid positions, including:\n\nAfter serving as [[Of counsel]] with the Munich office of law firm GSK Stockmann + Kollegen for many years, Waigel – alongside [[Alexander Radwan]], among others – joined Waigel Rechtsanwälte in 2016.\n\nIn 2008, following revelations about violations of the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]], the German industrial conglomerate [[Siemens]] agreed to install Waigel as an outside corporate monitor for four years. Waigel was the first compliance monitor who is not a U.S. national. He served in this position between January 2009 and October 2012.\n\nIn 2011, Waigel served as a member of the Board of Trustees of the [[Munich bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics]].\n\nIn 2012, Waigel joined a newly established external advisory panel under the leadership of [[Jürgen Hambrecht]] at [[Deutsche Bank]], which was to review compensation and governance at the company.\n\nEven after the end of his political career, Waigel was a CSU delegate to the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Convention]] for the purpose of electing the [[President of Germany]] in 2009, 2010, and 2017.\n\nIn 2013, Waigel was offered the role of president of [[TSV 1860 Munich]] but decided against it. Amid the [[2015 FIFA corruption case]], he declined offers to join an advisory board to the [[FIFA|2016 FIFA Reform Committee]].\n\nIn 2016, Waigel was appointed by [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] to a three-member panel to oversee the implementation of a new law designed to avoid potential conflicts of interest, requiring senior German officials from the chancellor to deputy ministers to observe a cooling-off period if they want to quit the government for a job in business. Alongside [[David Gold, Baron Gold]] and [[Noëlle Lenoir]], he was later appointed by [[Airbus]] to an Independent Compliance Review Panel (ICRP) in 2017, amid investigations by the [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]] (SFO) and the Parquet National Financier (PNF) into allegations of [[fraud]], [[bribery]] and [[corruption]] in the company's civil aviation business.\n\nFrom 1966-1993 Waigel was married to Karin Waigel (two children).

As a child, he was the pupil of a painter who had been persecuted as a Rightist. After his school education was cut short by the Cultural Revolution, he studied by himself, copying out a Chinese dictionary word by word. At fifteen, he joined a propaganda arts troupe, and was later assigned a job as a watchmender's apprentice. For a few years he worked in a petrochemical plant near Beijing, then in 1979, moved to the capital and became a photojournalist for a magazine published by the All China Federation of Trade Unions. During this time, he joined the 'underground' No Name art group, the Yuanmingyuan poetry group, and the April photographers' group. He held clandestine exhibitions of his paintings in his one-room shack in Nanxiao Lane, which became a meeting point for dissident artists and writers of Beijing. \nIn 1983, his paintings were denounced during the Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign, and he was placed in detention. After his release, he resigned from his job and set off on a three-year journey through China, selling his paintings and stories as he went. When he returned to Beijing in 1986, he wrote \"Stick Out Your Tongue\", a novella inspired by his travels through Tibet. Its publication in the official journal \"People's Literature\" in February 1987 coincided with a nationwide crackdown on the arts, and the government publicly denounced the work as an example of Bourgeois liberalism. All copies of the journal were confiscated and destroyed, and a blanket ban was placed on the future publications of Ma Jian's books.\n\nFortunately, just before this event, Ma Jian had moved to Hong Kong. He wrote \"Bardo\", a novel about two doomed lovers who are reincarnated through Chinese history, and \"The Nine Crossroads\", about a group of sent-down youth who are sent to a remote mountain inhabited by a primitive tribe.\n\nIn 1989, Ma Jian returned to Beijing and took part in the democracy protests. After the Tiananmen massacre, he remained in the capital and wrote The Noodle Maker, a dark political satire. For the next few years, he travelled back and forth between Hong Kong and China, editing, briefly, the Hong Kong arts magazine, Wen Yi Bao, and setting up 'New Era' publishing company and the literary journal 'Trends', which published essays and novels banned in China.\n\nAfter the Handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, Ma Jian moved to Germany to take up a post teaching Chinese literature at Ruhr University, and to work on \"Beijing Coma\", a novel about the Tiananmen massacre and the decade of political repression and economic growth that followed it. In 1999, he moved to London and wrote \"Red Dust\", a fictionalised account of his journey through China in the 1980s, which won the 2002 Thomas Cook Travel Book Award. He returned to China regularly, and resumed work on \"Beijing Coma\", which was finally published in 2008 and won the 2009 Index on Censorship T.R. Fyvel Book Award and the 2010 Athens Prize for Literature. In 2008–2009, he travelled extensively through the remote interior of China to research The Dark Road, a novel that explores the One Child Policy, published by Chatto & Windus and Penguin in 2013.\n\nIn 2001, he collaborated in founding the Independent Chinese PEN Centre, a branch of PEN International, became its board member in 2003–2005 and 2009–2011, a member of its Freedom to Write Committee since 2003, and director of its Press & Translation Committee since 2011.\n\nMa Jian is a vocal critic of China's Communist regime. His works explore themes and subjects that are taboo in China. He has continually called for greater freedom of expression and the release of jailed writers and other political prisoners. As a result, his books have been banned in China for the last 25 years, and since the summer of 2011, he has been denied entry into the mainland. Despite the restrictions placed on him, Ma Jian has become a leading Chinese writer, internationally distinguished with his works translated into a great number of languages, including English, French, Spanish, German, Swedish, Norwegian, Catalan, Japanese, Dutch, Hebrew, Romanian, Turkish, Greek, Polish, Korean, Italian and Portuguese.\n\nIn April 2012, while attending the London Book Fair, Ma used red paint to smear a cross over his face and a copy of his banned book \"Beijing Coma\" and called his Chinese publisher a \"mouthpiece of the Chinese communist party\" after being \"manhandled\" while attempting to present the book to the director of the General Administration of Press and Publication and the director of National Copyright Administration, Liu Binjie, at the fair.\n\nIn November 2018, Ma was a guest at the Hong Kong International Literary Festival. Tai Kwun, the venue for the events, initially cancelled his two talks, because it did not want to \"become a platform to promote the political interests of any individual\", but subsequently reversed course. The incident sparked public outcry in Hong Kong. Many related this with the recent Victor Mallet visa controversy and the cancellation of Badiucao's exhibition, complaining that China was covertly silencing critics in the autonomous territory and curbing her autonomy.\n\nHe lives in London with his partner and translator, Flora Drew, and their four children.\n\nMa came to the attention of the English-speaking world with his story collection \"Stick Out Your Tongue\", translated into English in 2006. The stories are set in Tibet. Their most remarked-upon feature is that traditional Tibetan culture is not idealised, but rather depicted as harsh and often inhuman; one reviewer noted that the \"stories sketch multi-generational incest, routine sexual abuse and ritual rape\". The book was banned in China as a \"vulgar and obscene book that defames the image of our Tibetan compatriots.\"\n\nMa's travel memoir \"Red Dust: A Path Through China\" (2001) is about his wanderings through remote areas of China from 1983–86 as a long-haired jobless vagabond. It won the 2002 Thomas Cook Travel Book Award.\n\nHis novel \"Beijing Coma\" (2008) tells the story of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 from the point of view of the fictional Dai Wei, a participant in the events left in a coma by the violent end of the protests. The comatose narrator functions as a metaphor for the ability to remember and the inability to act. It has received critical acclaim, with Tom Deveson of \"The Times\" describing it as \"epic in scope but intimate in feeling … magnificent\" and the \"Financial Times\" calling it \"an epic yet intimate work that deserves to be recognised and to endure as the great Tienanmen novel.”\n\n\nBooks of short stories and novellas\n\n\nNovels\n\n\nOther collections\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2286435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2286435", "title": "Walter Heitler", "text": "Walter Heitler\n\nWalter Heinrich Heitler (; 2 January 1904 – 15 November 1981) was a German physicist who made contributions to quantum electrodynamics and quantum field theory. He brought chemistry under quantum mechanics through his theory of valence bonding.\n\nIn 1922, Heitler began his study of physics at the Karlsruhe Technische Hochschule, in 1923 at the Humboldt University of Berlin, and in 1924 at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU), where he studied under both Arnold Sommerfeld and Karl Herzfeld. The latter was his thesis advisor when he obtained his doctorate in 1926; Herzfeld taught courses in theoretical physics and one in physical chemistry, and in Sommerfeld's absence often took over his classes. From 1926 to 1927, he was a Rockefeller Foundation Fellow for postgraduate research with Niels Bohr at the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen and with Erwin Schrödinger at the University of Zurich. He then became an assistant to Max Born at the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Göttingen. Heitler completed his Habilitation, under Born, in 1929, and then remained as a Privatdozent until 1933. In that year, he was let go by the university because he was Jewish.\n\nAt the time Heitler received his doctorate, three Institutes for Theoretical Physics formed a consortium which worked on the key problems of the day, such as atomic and molecular structure, and exchanged both scientific information and personnel in their scientific quests. These institutes were located at the LMU, under Arnold Sommerfeld, the University of Göttingen, under Max Born, and the University of Copenhagen, under Niels Bohr. Furthermore, Werner Heisenberg and Born had just recently published their trilogy of papers which launched the matrix mechanics formulation of quantum mechanics. Also, in early 1926, Erwin Schrödinger, at the University of Zurich, began to publish his quintet of papers which launched the wave mechanics formulation of quantum mechanics and showed that the wave mechanics and matrix mechanics formulations were equivalent. These papers immediately put the personnel at the leading theoretical physics institutes onto applying these new tools to understanding atomic and molecular structure. It was in this environment that Heitler went on his Rockefeller Foundations Fellowship, leaving LMU and within a period of two years going to do research and study with the leading figures of the day in theoretical physics, Bohr's personnel in Copenhagen, Schrödinger in Zurich, and Born in Göttingen.\n\nIn Zurich, with Fritz London, Heitler applied the new quantum mechanics to deal with the saturable, nondynamic forces of attraction and repulsion, i.e., exchange forces, of the hydrogen molecule. Their valence bond treatment of this problem, was a landmark in that it brought chemistry under quantum mechanics. Furthermore, their work greatly influenced chemistry through Linus Pauling, who had just received his doctorate and on a Guggenheim Fellowship visited Heitler and London in Zurich, as Pauling spent much of his career studying the nature of the chemical bond. The application of quantum mechanics to chemistry would be a prominent theme in Heitler's career.\n\nWhile Heitler was at Göttingen, Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933. With the rising prominence of anti-Semitism under Hitler, Born took it upon himself to take the younger Jewish generation under his wing. In doing so, Born arranged for Heitler to get a position that year as a Research Fellow at the University of Bristol, with Nevill Francis Mott.\n\nAt Bristol, Heitler was a Research Fellow of the Academic Assistance Council, in the H. H. Wills Physics Laboratory. At Bristol, among other things, he worked on quantum field theory and quantum electrodynamics on his own, as well as in collaboration with other scientific refugees from Hitler, such as Hans Bethe and Herbert Fröhlich, who also left Germany in 1933.\n\nWith Bethe, he published a paper on pair production of gamma rays in the Coulomb field of an atomic nucleus, in which they developed the Bethe-Heitler formula for Bremsstrahlung.\n\nHeitler also contributed to the understanding of cosmic rays,\nas well as predicted the existence of the electrically neutral pi meson.\n\nIn 1936, Heitler published his major work on quantum electrodynamics, \"The Quantum Theory of Radiation\", which marked the direction for future developments in quantum theory. The book appeared in many editions and printings and has been translated into Russian.\n\nAfter the fall of France in 1940, Heitler was briefly interned on the Isle of Man for several months.\n\nHeitler remained at Bristol eight years, until 1941, when he became a professor at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, which was arranged there by Erwin Schrödinger, Director of the School for Theoretical Physics.\n\nAt Dublin, Heitler's work with H. W. Peng on radiation damping theory and the meson scattering process resulted in the Heitler-Peng integral equation.\n\nDuring the 1942–1943 academic year, Heitler gave a course on elementary wave mechanics, during which W. S. E. Hickson took notes and prepared a finished copy. These notes were the basis for Heitler's book \"Elementary Wave Mechanics: Introductory Course of Lectures\", first published in 1943. A new edition was published as \"Elementary Wave Mechanics\" in 1945. This version was revised and republished many times, as well as being translated into French and Italian and published in 1949 and in German in 1961. A further revised version appeared as \"Elementary Wave Mechanics With Applications to Quantum Chemistry\" in 1956, as well as in German in 1961.\n\nSchrödinger resigned as Director of the School for Theoretical Physics in 1946, but stayed at Dublin, whereupon Heitler became Director. Heitler stayed at Dublin until 1949, when he accepted a position as Ordinarius Professor for Theoretical Physics and Director of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Zurich, where he remained until 1974, when he retired.\n\nIn 1958, Heitler held the Lorentz Chair for Theoretical Physics at the University of Leiden.\n\nWhile in Zurich, after some years, he began writing on the philosophical relationship of science to religion. His books were published in German, English, and French.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In her 2005 classification in \"Mammal Species of the World\", Simmons listed the genera \"Cistugo\" and \"Lasionycteris\" in the Myotinae in addition to \"Myotis\" itself. However, molecular data indicate that \"Cistugo\" is distantly related to all other Vespertilionidae, so it was reclassified into its own family, the Cistugidae, and that \"Lasionycteris\" belongs in the Vespertilioninae. The genus \"Submyotodon\" has since been added to the subfamily, making it and \"Myotis\" its only members.\n\nTheir ears are normally longer than they are wide, with a long and lance-shaped tragus, hence their English and zoological names (in Greek, \"myotis\" and \"myosotis\" mean \"mouse-ear\"). The species within this genus vary in size from very large to very small for vesper bats, with a single pair of mammary glands.\n\nMouse-eared bats are generally insectivores. \"M. vivesi\", and several members of the trawling bat ecomorph \"Leuconoe\", have relatively large feet with long toes, and take small fish from the water surface (they also take insects).\n\n\"Myotis\" species are remarkably long-lived for their size; in 2018, researchers revealed that a longitudinal study appears to indicate that \"Myotis\" telomeres do not shrink with age, and that telomerase does not appear to be present in the \"Myotis\" metabolism.\n\nTraditionally, \"Myotis\" has been divided into three large subgenera—\"Leuconoe\", \"Myotis\", and \"Selysius\". However, molecular data indicate that these subgenera are not natural groups, but instead unnatural assemblages of convergently similar species. Instead, \"Myotis\" species largely fall in two main clades, one containing Old World and the other New World species. However, the Asian species \"Myotis latirostris\" falls outside the clade formed by these main groups, and may represent a separate genus, and the Eurasian \"Myotis brandtii\" is related to New World species.\n\n\"Myotis\" is a highly species-rich genus, and the classification of many species remains unsettled.

After finishing his doctoral dissertation, \"Coniectanea in historiam rei metricae Francogallicae,\" he began to lecture at the University of Münster on the philology of the English and Romance languages, and defended his post-doctoral thesis (Habilitation) on the Roman de Rou. \nIn 1870 he became professor of modern languages at the University of Marburg, and after the reconstitution of Strassburg University as Kaiser-Wilhelm-Universität was appointed the very first Professor of English on the European continent. \nIn 1874 he began to edit, in collaboration with Wilhelm Scherer, Ernst Martin and Erich Schmidt, \"Quellen und Forschungen zur Sprach- und Kulturgeschichte der germanischen Völker\", a book series meant to assist the German government in the Germanizing of Strasbourg and Alsace-Lorraine. While he continued to lecture on French and English literature, he smartly focused his research on the father of English poetry, Geoffrey Chaucer. \n\nIn 1877, he published \"Chaucer: Studien zur Geschichte seiner Entwickelung und zur Chronologie seiner Schriften\", a study which analyzed Chaucer's literary models and verse forms to determine the later widely accepted division of the poet's works into three periods: a first period during which he was mostly influenced by French models as well as by Ovid; a second period during which his main inspiration came from Italian models (Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarch); and a third period of mature literary production.\n\nIn 1884, he published \"Chaucers Sprache und Verskunst\", the first full-fledged investigation of Chaucer's grammar and metrics and an achievement that guaranteed him a place of honor as recently as 1987, in the General Bibliography of the \"Riverside Chaucer\", the most widely used edition of Chaucer in the world. English-language publishing houses, such as Henry Holt & Company, N.Y., and G. Bell & Sons, London, published English translations of his works on Early English Literature during these years. \n\nHe also published critical editions of the \"General Prologue\" of the \"Canterbury Tales\" and the \"Compleynte unto Pity\". Ten Brink's work stimulated a revival of Chaucer study in the United Kingdom as well as in Germany, and to him was indirectly due the foundation of the English Chaucer Society. In addition, he made important contributions to the study of Shakespeare and \"Beowulf\" and authored one of the first scholarly histories of English literature. His international scholarly reputation as well as his efforts at Germanizing the University of Strasbourg contributed to his appointment as Rektor (President) of his institution in 1890.\n\nTogether with Julius Zupitza, Eugen Kölbing, and Ewald Flügel, ten Brink helped found modern English Studies.\n\n"}
{"id": "2286473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2286473", "title": "Cape gannet", "text": "Cape gannet\n\nThe Cape gannet (\"Morus capensis\") originally \"Sula capensis\", is a large seabird of the gannet family, Sulidae.\n\nThey are easily identified by their large size, black and white plumage and distinctive yellow crown and hindneck. The pale blue bill is pointed with fine serrations near the tip; perhaps because of the depth and speed of the gannet's dive when fishing (depending on altitude, gannets hit the water at speeds of between , its beak has no external nostrils into which the water might be forced.\n\nGerman naturalist Hinrich Lichtenstein described the Cape gannet in 1823.\n\nThe Sulidae, the gannets and boobies, appeared about 30 million years ago. Early Sulidae fossils most resembled the boobies, although they were more aquatic, with the gannets splitting off later, about 16 million years ago. The gannets evolved in the northern hemisphere, later colonising the southern oceans. The most ancient extant species may be the Abbott's booby, possibly the sole survivor of an otherwise extinct separate lineage. A 2011 genetic study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA suggests that the ancestor of the gannets arose around 2.5 million years ago before splitting into northern and southern lineages. The latter then splitting into the Cape and Australasian gannets around 0.5 million years ago. The three gannets are generally considered to be separate species forming a superspecies, though they have also formerly been classified as subspecies of the northern gannet (\"Sula bassanus\").\n\nWhen seen in flight the snow-white body with the black tail, primaries and secondaries, and dark bill makes them easy to identify. At closer range the distinctive golden crown and nape, which gradually becomes white on the neck, is noticeable. Juveniles and immatures are dark brown with a pale bill, and can resemble the dark-coloured boobies at first glance. Adults are about long and have a wingspan and weigh \"ca.\" .\n\nThe Cape gannet is identified from the Australasian gannet by the all-black tail, a longer black stripe down the throat (from underneath the beak) and more extensive black on the face, but all of these features are difficult to identify unless at close proximity. The Cape gannet is also very similar to the northern gannet, but the latter differs from its entirely white tail and its wings, which are only black at the tip. It also is similar to the blue-footed booby (\"Sula nebouxii\").\n\nGannet pairs may remain together over several seasons. They perform elaborate greeting rituals at the nest, stretching their bills and necks skywards and gently tapping bills together.\n\nCape gannets begin breeding in August or September. Typically the clutch is a single bluish egg, which soon becomes soiled. Both parents are actively involved in the incubation process which lasts for 42 to 46 days until hatching. Gannets use their foot webs to incubate the egg. The foot webs, which are richly irrigated with blood vessels are wrapped around the egg.\n\nThe hatchling is black, naked and blind, it weighs only about , but within three weeks its body mass is one third of that of an adult. At eight weeks the chick outweighs the adult, and this remains so until it becomes a fledgling at 95–105 days of age.\n\nCape gannets are powerful fliers, using mainly a flap-gliding technique, which is more energy consuming than the dynamic-soaring favoured by albatrosses. As all Sulids, they are fish-eating birds that plunge-dive from considerable height.\n\nThe breeding range of Cape gannet is restricted to southern Africa in three islands off Namibia and three islands off South Africa. They normally nest in large and dense colonies on flat islands or on flat ledges of the steeply sloping Mercury Island off Namibia. The world population was estimated in 1996 to number about 340,000 birds, with 12% in Namibia and 88% in South Africa. The largest colony of this bird, with over 140,000 birds, is found on Malgas Island, South Africa. Several birds have occasionally been found breeding on offshore Australian islands, together with Australasian gannets, although the Cape species is never represented by more than a few pairs.\n\nThe non-breeding range of Cape gannets extends from the coastal waters off the Gulf of Guinea on the west coast of Africa, to Mozambique on the east coast. They seldom occur farther offshore than 100 km, though records of birds more than 200 km offshore exist for both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.\n\nNumbers of Cape gannets at the Namibian islands have declined considerably between 1956 and 2000 from 114,600 to 18,200 breeding pairs respectively, an 84% decrease in less than fifty years. This contrasts with the trends at the South African islands where numbers have increased about 4.3 times during the same period, from 34,400 to 148,000 breeding pairs.\n\nVagrancy to the northern Atlantic Ocean has been reported for the Cape gannet on several occasions, but is currently believed to be unproven. Crochet and Haas examined the status of the species in the western Palearctic region. They list a number of historical claims which had not been accepted by national bird records committees, and analyse the single record which had hitherto been widely accepted, a juvenile recovered offshore from Western Sahara in 1966. In relation to the latter bird, they conclude that a mistake had occurred; the original data placed the bird inland, in Chad, with the offshore Western Saharan location being the result of an attempt to correct this to a more plausible location. A retransposition of the original latitude and longitude gives a location off the Namibian coast, well within the regular wintering range of the species. As a result, they recommend that the Cape gannet be deleted from the Western Palearctic list.\n\n\n"}

It stretches over an area of comprising scrub-thorn arid forests, dry deciduous forests, grasslands, and rocky hills. This area was a hunting preserve of the Alwar state and was declared a wildlife reserve in 1955. It was given the status of a tiger reserve making it a part of India's Project Tiger in 1978. The wildlife sanctuary was declared a national park in 1990, with a total area of about . It is the first reserve in the world with successfully relocated tigers. It is an important biodiversity area in the Northern Aravalli leopard and wildlife corridor.\n\nThe park is situated away from Hindaun, from Jaipur and from Delhi. It is a part of the Aravalli Range and the Khathiar-Gir dry deciduous forests ecoregion. It is rich in mineral resources, such as copper. In spite of the Supreme Court's 1991 ban on mining in the area, marble mining continues to threaten the environment.\n\n\nThe dominant tree in the forests is dhok (\"Anogeissus pendula\"). Other trees include the salar (\"Boswellia serrata\"), kadaya (Sterculia urens), dhak (\"Butea monosperma\"), gol (\"Lannea coromandelica\"), ber (\"Ziziphus mauritiana\") and khair (\"Acacia catechu\"). Bargad (\"Ficus benghalensis\"), arjun (\"Terminalia arjuna\"), gugal (\"Commiphora wightii\") or bamboo. Shrubs are numerous, such as kair (\"Capparis decidua\"), adusta (\"Adhatoda vesica\") and jhar ber (\"Ziziphus nummularia\").\n\nApart from the Bengal tiger, the reserve includes many wildlife species including Indian leopard, jungle cat, caracal, striped hyena, golden jackal, chital, sambar deer, nilgai, wild boar, small Indian civet, Javan mongoose, ruddy mongoose, honey badger, Rhesus macaque and Northern plains gray langur and Indian hare.\nSariska is also ethereal for bird watchers with some of the rarest feathered species like grey partridge, white-throated kingfisher, Indian peafowl, bush quail, sandgrouse, treepie, golden-backed woodpecker, crested serpent eagle and the Indian eagle-owl.\n\nIn 2003, 16 tigers lived in the reserve. In 2004, it was reported that no tigers were sighted in the reserve, and that no indirect evidence of tiger presence was found such as pug marks, scratch marks on trees, scats. The Rajasthan Forest Department explained that \"the tigers had temporarily migrated outside the reserve and would be back after monsoon season\". Project Tiger, now National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), backed this assumption. In January 2005, it was reported that there were no tigers left in Sariska. \nThe Rajasthan Forest Department and the Project Tiger Director declared an \"emergency tiger census\" in Sariska. The Central Bureau of Investigation, India's intelligence agency, conducted a probe. After a two-month investigation, the agency finally declared that no tigers were left in the reserve. Poaching was blamed for the disappearance of tigers. \n\nIn July 2008, two tigers from Ranthambhore National Park were relocated to Sariska Tiger Reserve.

The camp's female inmates serve as prostitutes for German officers and are subjected to humiliating treatment, torture, and rape. When the two female agents learn that their target is being held in solitary detention, one of them arranges to be punished so that she can make contact. This leads to Lt. Harman (Lease) being stripped and strung up by her wrists. The target uses her body to free Harman and they attempt their escape. The escape plan ends in a climactic battle. The movie shows female full frontal nudity for a majority of the film.\n\nThe movie is seen as a cult classic because it represents the beginning of a fashion for exploitation films about women in prison in the 1970s, such as \"Women in Cages\" (1971) and \"The Big Bird Cage\" (1972), both of which made Pam Grier a recognizable name in the genre. It is also the first in the Nazi exploitation (or Nazisploitation) genre of concentration camp movies, including \"\" (1974)–which was produced by David F. Friedman and led to several sequels with Dyanne Thorne as the titular character–and the Italian \"Nazi Love Camp 27\" (1977) and \"Last Orgy of the Third Reich\" (1977), the latter of which helped launch Daniela Poggi's showbusiness career.\n\nIt was declined a video certificate by the British Board of Film Classification in 2002 and by the New Zealand Office of Film & Literature Classification. The BBFC upheld their rejection of the film when it was submitted for a certificate for streaming in 2020. It was originally banned in Australia, before passing several times in a modified version with an R18+ rating. It was finally passed uncut in 2005.\n\n\n"}

This ferry operated across the Gulf of Maine between Portland, Maine, and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, until the end of the 2004 sailing season.\n\nThe Portland-Yarmouth seasonal (summer only) ferry service was established in 1970 by European ferry operator Lion Ferry. The first vessel was the M/S \"Prince of Fundy\" which operated from 1970-1976. She was assisted on the route between 1973-1976 by the M/S \"Bolero\". Between 1976-1981 the only vessel in use was the M/S \"Caribe\".\n\nLion Ferry leased the International Marine Terminal from the City of Portland. At the City's request the original lease included a clause for bilateral \"route protection\" which prevented Lion from operating a route from any other New England port to Nova Scotia, and prevented the City from allowing another operator to sail to Nova Scotia during Lion's operating season. The City's facilities were used by other operators including cruise ships. Lion also used the Yarmouth Ferry Terminal in Nova Scotia which was owned by the federal Department of Transport, although Lion had to share its Yarmouth facility with Canadian National Railways which operated the MV \"Bluenose\" service to Bar Harbor, Maine.\n\nFrom 1978-1982, CN Marine also operated the MV \"Marine Evangeline\" (ex-MS \"Duke of Yorkshire\") between Yarmouth and another terminal owned by Canadian National Railways on the Portland waterfront.\n\nThe service was sold by Lion Ferry in 1982 to Baron Stig Leuhusen who established Prince of Fundy Cruises as a subsidiary of Panamanian-based Transworld Steamship Company. The vessel M/S \"Scotia Prince\" (ex-M/S \"Stena Olympica\") was acquired and began service that season. In 1983, the other Yarmouth ferry operator, CN Marine, began using a sistership M/V \"Bluenose II\" (ex-M/S \"Stena Jutlandica\") on its Bar Harbor crossing. Prince of Fundy Cruises had the \"Scotia Prince\" lengthened in 1987 for increased capacity, changing the visual similarities between both ships. Leuhusen died in 1996 and his estate listed the company for sale in 1999.\n\nIn August 2000 the company's shares were purchased by a group led by Matthew Hudson of Virginia. The company was renamed Scotia Prince Cruises. The \"Scotia Prince\" was re-flagged (Bahamas). The company upgraded the ship and onboard services in addition to other improvements made at the company. The service was repositioned from a transport provider to a transport and package vacation company. The service was marketed as a cruiseferry and destination in its own right.\n\nIn 1997, CN Marine's successor (government-owned and subsidized) Marine Atlantic Yarmouth-Bar Harbor service was privatized by the government and taken over, along with the M/V \"Bluenose\", by Northumberland Ferries Limited which established a subsidiary service named Bay Ferries Limited. At the same time, the federal Department of Transport transferred operational responsibility of the Yarmouth ferry terminal to Bay Ferries. The \"Bluenose II\" was sold at the end of the 1997 season by Bay Ferries and the proceeds were used to purchase the high-speed catamaran ferry HSC INCAT 046, named \"The Cat\". Service began the following summer in 1998 dropping the crossing time from 6 hours to 2.5 hours. A few years later, HSC INCAT 046 was replaced by a slightly larger ship, HSC The Cat, still referred to as \"The Cat\".\n\nDuring the winter of 2002-2003, Scotia Prince Cruises Ltd. inaugurated a service called the \"Yucatan Express\", using the M/S \"Scotia Prince\" on a route between Tampa, Florida, in the United States and Cancun, Quintana Roo, and Merida, Yucatán, in Mexico.\n\nIn 2004, the company discovered dangerous levels of mold in the City of Portland's terminal. The CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health evaluated the terminal in March 2005. Based on toxicological and remediation reports and NIOSH's comments on the then current state of the IMT and the likelihood that the building could not be made safe, SPC cancelled its 2005 season. NIOSH's final report reiterates their on-site evaluation stating \"a health hazard did exist at the IMT building\" and \"Additional work has been done at the remaining north (east) building of the IMT since the NIOSH site visit. However, the underlying structural defects of the building have not been addressed, resulting in a high likelihood of continued microbial growth\". Within hours of SPC notifying the City that it was cancelling the 2005 season for safety reasons, the City of Portland held a press conference announcing they had terminated SPC's lease. The City immediately evicted Scotia Prince Cruises.\nThe company will not resume services from Portland. The ship was laid-up in Charleston, South Carolina, in December 2004 and was placed on the market for charter or sale. Following Hurricane Katrina, the Federal Emergency Management Agency chartered the vessel in mid-September 2005 for 6 months as a floating hotel for victims made homeless from that natural disaster. The ship was eventually sold in early 2007. In late September 2005 it was announced that Bay Ferries Limited would begin offering high-speed service from Yarmouth-Portland in 2006 using HSC \"INCAT 059\".\n\nYucatán Express offered on-again, off-again pedestrian and vehicle ferry service on the Canadian ferry ship \"Scotia Prince\". For a short time, it ran in the winter from Tampa, Florida, to Mérida, Mexico, and to Puerto Moreles near Cancún. However, this service was discontinued.\n\nIn March 2011, the vessel was acquired by Flemingo Liners, a UAE-registered company with roots in India, to revive the ferry route between India and Sri Lanka, which had been suspended in 1983 due to the Sri Lankan civil war. The vessel's first overnight sea crossing was on 11 June 2011, from Tuticorin to Colombo harbour, which will be its standard route, taking 14 hours. The most expensive tickets are generally half-price compared to air tickets between Colombo and the nearest airports in south India, namely Chennai and Bangalore.\n\nThe vessel was earlier idled in a Gibraltar dock between June 2010 and March 2011, after being briefly operated by Marmara Lines company between Ancona and Cesme earlier in 2010.\n\nOn March 20, 2012, the media reports that the vessel was sold for scrap metal in India.\n\n\n"}

There was some uncertainty about Nyro's ability to lead the musicians by playing piano. As a result, pianist Stan Free was hired, and Nyro was encouraged to play the guitar instead, which she rejected.\n\n\"Wedding Bell Blues\" was released as a single in September 1966 and remained on the \"Bubbling Under\" segment of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 (then \"Pop Singles\") for 12 weeks, peaking at #103.\n\nFor the single version of \"Stoney End,\" Nyro was forced to rework some of the lyrics that referred to the Bible, because Verve felt it would cause too much controversy.\n\nThe album included several songs that would become hits for other artists.

It maintains electrical neutrality within the internal circuit, preventing the cell from rapidly running its reaction to equilibrium. If no salt bridge were present, the solution in one half cell would accumulate negative charge and the solution in the other half cell would accumulate positive charge as the reaction proceeded, quickly preventing further reaction, and hence production of electricity.\n\nSalt bridges usually come in two types: glass tube and filter paper.\n\nOne type of salt bridge consists of a U-shaped glass tube filled with a relatively inert electrolyte; usually potassium chloride or sodium chloride is used, although the diagram here illustrates the use of a potassium nitrate solution. The electrolyte is so chosen that they are mainly delocalised into their ions.\n\nThe electrolyte is often gelified with agar-agar to help prevent the intermixing of fluids which might otherwise occur.\n\nThe conductivity of a glass tube bridge depends mostly on the concentration of the electrolyte solution. At concentrations below saturation, an increase in concentration increases conductivity. Beyond-saturation electrolyte content and narrow tube diameter may both lower conductivity.\n\nThe other type of salt bridge consists of a filter paper, also soaked with a relatively inert electrolyte, a few common examples of which include potassium nitrate, potassium chloride, and sodium chloride. No gelification agent is required as the filter paper provides a solid medium for conduction.\n\nConductivity of this kind of salt bridge depends on a number of factors: the concentration of the electrolyte solution, the texture of the filter paper and the absorbing ability of the filter paper. Generally, smoother texture and higher absorbency equates to higher conductivity.\n\nA porous disk or other porous barriers between the two half-cells may be used instead of a salt bridge; however, they basically serve the same purpose.\n\n"}

{"id": "2286540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2286540", "title": "Catch points", "text": "Catch points\n\nCatch points and trap points are types of turnout which act as railway safety devices. Both work by guiding railway carriages and trucks from a dangerous route onto a separate, safer track. Catch points are used to derail vehicles which are out of control on steep slopes (known as \"runaways\"). Trap points are used to protect main railway lines from unauthorised vehicles moving onto them from sidings or branch lines. Either of these track arrangements may lead the vehicles into a sand drag or safety siding, track arrangements which are used to safely stop them after they have left the main tracks.\n\nA derail is another device used for the same purposes as catch and trap points.\n\n\"Trap points\" are found at the exit from a siding or where a secondary track joins a main line. A facing turnout is used to prevent any unauthorised movement that may otherwise obstruct the main line. The trap points also prevent any damage that may be done by a vehicle passing over points not set for traffic joining the main line. In the United Kingdom, the use of trap points at siding exits is required by government legislation.\n\nAn unauthorised movement may be due to a runaway wagon, or may be a train passing a signal at danger. When a signal controlling passage onto a main line is set to \"danger\", the trap points are set to derail any vehicle passing that signal. Interlocking is used to make sure that the signal cannot be set to allow passage onto the main line until the trap points have been aligned to ensure this movement can take place.\n\nTrap points should preferably be positioned to ensure that any unauthorised vehicle is stopped a safe distance from the main line. However, due to space limitations, it is not always possible to guarantee this.\n\nIf the lines are track circuited and a wagon or train using the catchpoint could foul an adjacent line, then a track circuit interrupter will be fitted to one of the run-off rails. When a train runs off it will break the track circuit and set main line signals to 'danger'.\n\nThere are several different ways of constructing trap points:\nThe type of trap points to be used depends on factors such as the gradient of the siding, and whether locomotives enter the siding.\n\n\"Catch points\" are used where track follows a rising gradient. They are used to derail (or \"catch\") any unauthorised vehicles travelling down the gradient. This may simply be a vehicle that has accidentally been allowed to run away down the slope, or could be a wagon that has decoupled from its train. In either case, the runaway vehicle could collide with a train farther down the slope, causing a serious accident.\n\nCatch points may consist of a full turnout or a single switch blade. In some cases, on a track that is only traversed by uphill traffic, trailing point blades are held in a position to derail any vehicle travelling downhill. However, any traffic travelling in the correct (uphill) direction can pass over the turnout safely, pushing the switch blades into the appropriate position. Once the wheels have passed, the catch points are forced back into the derailing position by springs. In these cases, a lever may be provided to temporarily override the catch points and allow safe passage down the gradient in certain controlled circumstances.\n\nThe use of catch points became widespread in the United Kingdom after the Abergele rail disaster (1868), where runaway wagons containing paraffin oil (kerosene) collided with an express train. Catch points continued to be used in the UK until the mid-20th century. At this time, continuous automatic brakes, which automatically stop any vehicles separated from their train, were widely adopted, making catch points largely obsolete.\n\nSometimes a track is located between two other tracks that are converging, and there is nowhere for a catchpoint to divert a train to. In such cases, a pair of single catchpoints of left and right hand may be provided to derail the overrunning train without directing it to either side. The two blades of an ordinary turnout may also be operated separately for the same purpose.\n\nExamples would be the north and south ends of platforms 1 and 2 at Hornsby in New South Wales.\n\nIn some cases, catch points and trap points direct vehicles into a \"sand drag\" or \"safety siding\", also sometimes called an \"arrestor bed\". This may be a siding simply leading to a mound of sand, gravel or other granular material, or a siding where the rails are within sand-filled troughs. This method of stopping a vehicle travelling at speed is preferred over a buffer stop as there is less shock to the vehicle involved.\n\nA cheap and simple alternative to catch points or a derail is a chock block, which is a piece of timber that can be positioned and locked over one of the rails at the end of a siding to protect the main line from runaways. In order for the siding to be used the chock block must be removed.\n\nBecause catch points are rarely needed, it is not always clear whether they will in fact derail a runaway train effectively and as safely as possible. For example, use of Castle Cary catch points would result in the train being directed into a footbridge. Use of catch points to derail a train that had passed a signal at danger at London Paddington station in June 2016 resulted in the empty train, a Class 165, hitting and severely damaging an overhead line electrification stanchion, causing all services to and from the station to be halted for hours.\n\nIn 2010, in snowy conditions, at Carrbridge, a Class 66 passed a red signal as well as catch points, leading to the train going down the embankment, injuring the two crew on board.\n\n\n"}

Initially, the camp commander and the prison physician, Dr. Costa, wait for a few guards on a truck. On board are six young women. Three of them were arrested on suspicion of revolutionary activities, the other three are made available to the guards to be raped. The three detainees, Karine, Barbara, and Aida, are found shortly thereafter, naked and chained in a standing position, in the notorious Cellblock 9. Gradually, they are presented to the \"interrogation\", which is supported by the doctor through various tortures. Barbara and Aida resist the torture and remain silent, Karine, however, breaks down under the torture, and some revolutionaries denounced the (unnamed) city.\n\nIn the meantime, the young indigenous student Marie also ends up in the cellblock. Allegedly, propaganda material was found on her by the insurgents. Their torture was to spend three days without food and water in a single cell. She was then taken to dinner with the commander of the doctor, where they have oral sex in order to then get a little sip of salty Champagne.\n\nAfter the four women in Cellblock 9 again are forging among themselves, they devise a plan to contact their contacts in the capital. The quartet manages to distract the guard in order to knock him out and flee with his rifle. Shortly after leaving the cellblock, Aida is killed in a gunfight with another guard who is also killed. The other three flee into the jungle, where Barbara has been shot and they progress slowly. They make it to an old temple, where they feel safe and remove the bullet from Barbara's shoulder. Karine and Marie go into the jungle to look for food, but the guards find their trail and meet them at the temple. As Barbara is killed, the other two, alerted by her screams, run back to the temple and are suddenly confronted by the camp commander and the doctor (surrounded by prison guards). In a last desperate action Karine attempts to steal the commander's pistol. When she fails to pull the trigger, the commander gives the order to fire and the last two prisoners are struck down on the spot. With the desecration of the corpses, the film ends.\n\n\nThe film was first released in West Germany on 17 March 1978. In addition to its original title, the film is also known as \"Escape from the Island of Death\". In English-speaking countries it is also known as \"Tropical Inferno\" and \"Women in Cellblock 9\".\n\n"}

He attended Westminster High School in Westminster, California.\n\nKlesko was born June 12, 1971, in Westminster, California. His father was an oilfields worker whom Klesko lost at a young age. His mother, Lorene, worked at an aerospace parts company in Santa Ana and helped Klesko learn to play baseball. When he was nine, she dug a pitcher's mound for him in his backyard. She enrolled him in pitching school with Ron Lefebvre and put on catcher's gear herself to catch Klesko three times a week. Klesko attended Westminster High School, where even though he hit a lot of home runs, he starred as a pitcher, throwing a ninety-two mile per hour fastball and pitching for the USA Junior Olympic team. He strained a ligament pitching for the junior team at 17, though, and concentrated on hitting thereafter. Klesko signed a letter of intent to play college baseball at Arizona State, but he never did so, instead signing with the Atlanta Braves after the team selected him in the fifth round of the 1989 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft.\n\nKlesko hit a home run in three consecutive World Series games against the Cleveland Indians in Games 3, 4, and 5 of the 1995 World Series. In Game 3, he hit a solo shot off of Charles Nagy in the seventh inning of a 7-6 loss. The Game 4 home run, another solo shot (this time off Ken Hill) put the Braves up 1-0 in the sixth; they would win the game 5-2. In Game 5, his ninth-inning two-run home run to right field off José Mesa was almost caught by his mother; Klesko wound up trading the man who caught it an autographed Greg Maddux baseball for it. The Braves lost that game 5-4, but they beat the Indians for the fourth time in the sixth game to become World Series champions.\n\nKlesko hit at least 21 home runs in eight of his 13 major league seasons, with a high of 34 homers in . His most productive season came in , when he hit .286 with 30 home runs and posted career highs in RBI (113), runs (105), stolen bases (23) and slugging percentage (.539), and made the National League All-Star team. In , Klesko hit .300 with 29 HR and 95 RBI, and collected career-highs in hits (162) and doubles (39). Defensively he shuttled around the outfield and first base.\n\nIn his career, Klesko compiled a .370 on-base percentage with a .500 slugging average, for an .870 OPS. His .525 slugging percentage as a Brave ranks fourth all-time among the team's career leaders, ahead of Eddie Mathews. His .886 OPS as a Brave ranks him fifth among Braves' all-time leaders.\n\nKlesko missed nearly the entire season due to major shoulder surgery. He returned on September 21, drawing a walk as a pinch-hitter in his first plate appearance. On December 19, 2006, Klesko signed a one-year contract with the San Francisco Giants.

During the communist years, his books gave an unusual sense of liberty and new horizons by describing the experience of flying, and the closeness it forged - both between pilots, and between pilots and their machines. The plane is seen by Davidovici not simply as a machine that enables one to fly but as an actual character, with its own personality and almost with its own soul.\n\nHis work is influenced by writers like Ray Bradbury, Radu Tudoran and Bertolt Brecht.\nThe titles include \"The Horses of Voroneţ\" (1974), \"The Colour of the Sky\" (1981), \"Silver Wings\" (1983) and \"Rise and Walk\" (1989). \n\nKeeping a sense of proportion, it is reasonable to draw a parallel between Davidovici and the French aviator and writer Antoine de Saint Exupéry.

Hinault was pursuing his fifth Tour victory after having sat out the 1983 Tour because of injuries. Also that year, Fignon's team-mate Greg LeMond became the first American rider to finish in the top three and stand on the podium, and he also took the young rider classification. Belgian cyclist Frank Hoste won the points classification, and British Robert Millar won the mountains classification. The race consisted of 23 stages, totaling .\n\nThere was room for 18 teams in the 1984 Tour de France; in early 1984, there were 17 candidate teams. Although the Tour organisation approached AVP–Viditel and Metauromobili, an 18th team was not added. The 1984 Tour started with 170 cyclists, divided into 17 teams of 10 cyclists. Of these, 42 were riding the Tour de France for the first time. The average age of riders in the race was 26.99 years, ranging from the 21-year-old Carlos Marta () to the 37-year-old Joop Zoetemelk (). The cyclists had the youngest average age while the riders on had the oldest.\n\nThe teams entering the race were:\n\nThe 1984 Tour de France started on 29 June, and had one rest day, in Grenoble. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 18.\n\nThe 1984 Tour de France was a battle between reigning champion Fignon and his former team captain Hinault. Questions had been raised about the strength of Fignon's 1983 win due to Hinault's absence and Pascal Simon's withdrawal after breaking his shoulder whilst wearing the yellow jersey. Hinault won the prologue and the first two stages following the prologue were flat stages; the first of which was won by Frank Hoste in a bunch sprint with Ludo Peeters taking over as race leader. Tour organizers had made a purposeful effort to get riders from other countries outside of the traditional nations who usually make up the main field, and in stage two Ireland’s Stephen Roche and Denmark’s Kim Andersen both made the stage podium coming in just a few seconds behind stage winner Marc Madiot, as Jacques Hanegraaf claimed the yellow from Peeters going into the TTT in stage three. Over the previous five years or so the Team Time Trials would often be dominated by the Dutch TI-Raleigh squad, which was run by Peter Post as the Directeur Sportif, but there had been a rift between riders and some of them followed Post over to the new while others joined Jan Raas and Joop Zoetemelk on the new squad. Perhaps ironically in their first test competing against each other within the Tour de France the two teams tied for 2nd place at four seconds behind the Team of Fignon and Greg Lemond. The Team of Robert Millar and Pascal Simon finished 4th and Hinault’s new team had a tough day coming in 7th place, leaving Hinault out of the top 10 overall following the stage. The overall lead was still held by Hanegraaf by a single second over Adri Van Der Poel with Fignon in the best position among the proven GC contenders in 6th place at +0:13, and his teammate and Tour debutant LeMond sitting in 5th place just ten seconds off the lead. In stage four Ferdi Van Den Haute survived a solo attack to finish ahead of the peloton by over a minute to claim the stage win and in stage five a three rider breakaway made up of Paulo Ferreira, Maurice Le Guilloux and Vincent Barteau finished more than seventeen minutes ahead of the main field with Ferreira taking the stage victory and Barteau moving into the yellow jersey.\n\nStage six was a flat stage without a surviving breakaway meaning it was decided in a bunch finish, which was won by Hoste yet again, who this time edged out Eddy Planckaert and Gilbert Glaus at the finish line. Stage seven was an individual time trial which would provide a bit of clarity as to who the major contenders were going to be and it was won by Laurent Fignon. Two time Green Jersey winner Sean Kelly finished in 2nd while Hinault, who typically throughout his career dominated the ITT’s, finished in 3rd place 0:49 slower than Fignon. Other potential contenders including Roche finished at +1:07, Gerard Veldscholten at +1:11, the Australian Phil Anderson at +1:24 and the very strong Italian rider who was often among the contenders for the Giro Roberto Visentini finished at +1:53 behind. The three breakaway riders from stage five still made up the top three but as far as the General Classification was concerned, Fignon was the highest placed contender, with Anderson, Hinault, Veldscholten, LeMond, Visentini and Roche all within 3:00 of him. Stage eight was won by Pascal Jules who beat Ludo Peeters and Bruno Leali to the finish by nine seconds. Stage nine in this Tour was notable because it was 338 km long. This was the longest stage included in the race since the 1967 Tour de France and there has not been a stage longer than this since 1984. The last time a Tour stage was over 300 km was during the 1990 edition, the last time a stage was longer than 250 km was during the 2000 Tour and the last time a stage approached 250 km was in 2013 when there was a stage that was 243 km long which was not even a flat stage, but rather a stage that included Mont Ventoux. Stage 9 was won by Jan Raas and this would be the 10th and final stage win of his impressive career. The riders were on their bikes for nearly ten straight hours during this stage.\n\nIn stage ten Eric Vanderaerden beat Marc Dierickx in the sprint to take the stage win as the two of them escaped the peloton and beat it to the line by more than two minutes. More importantly in the overall standings the once seventeen minute gap held by Ferreira, Le Guilloux and Barteau was being considerably cut into and the race hadn't even reached the first set of high mountains in the Pyrenees, which began in stage eleven. In stage eleven Robert Millar won the first day in the mountains on a solo attack, with the Colombian climber Lucho Herrera coming in 2nd 0:41 behind him. Going into this stage Fignon held a gap of 1:13 over Hinault and by the end of the day it widened up to 2:05 as Fignon crossed the line in 7th place with Angel Arroyo. The next two stages were both flat stages which were won by Pascal Poisson and Pierre-Henri Mentheour and then the race moved into south central France for two intermediate/hilly stages which were won by Fons de Wolf and Frederic Vichot. The stage win by De Wolf was rather astonishing in that it was a solo breakaway in which he beat the favorites to the line by nearly 18:00, actually jumped ahead of Hinault in the overall standings and came within 1:32 of Fignon. The energy exerted in this stage proved to be very costly however, as de Wolf lost considerable time the following day and faded back in with the Domestiques for the remainder of the Tour.\n\nGoing into the rest day Le Guilloux and Ferreira had long since fallen out of the top 10, however Vincent Barteau, perhaps inspired by the legend and mystique associated with the Maillot Jaune, did not want to let it go as he still held a lead of over ten minutes on the 2nd place Fignon, who was leading the way as far as the serious contenders were concerned. Hinault trailed him by 2:13, Veldscholten by 2:15, Anderson by 3:04 and the young American LeMond was thus far proving he could ride with the best of the best in the biggest race of them all being just 4:10 behind the defending champion. Stage sixteen was another individual time trial which was once again won by Fignon who cut the lead of Barteau down to 6:29 while simultaneously adding 0:33 to his lead over the four time champion Hinault going into the Alps. Hinault made up his mind to strike during this first Alpine stage, which included l'Alpe d’Huez and Côte de Laffrey and he attacked Fignon over and over again, but was not able to break the young Parisian. Lucho Herrera won the stage and Fignon crossed in 2nd after dropping the Badger and taking considerable time out of him. In fact, the American Lemond even finished the stage fourteen seconds faster than Hinault. Barteau finally came apart on this stage losing more than ten minutes to Fignon, who for the first time in the Tour, officially took over as race leader with Barteau falling to 2nd at +4:22, Hinault in 3rd at +5:41, Millar in 4th at +8:25 and LeMond in 5th at +8:45. In stage eighteen Fignon caught and dropped Jean-Marie Grezet, who put in a very gutsy performance, to take the stage win. LeMond had himself another remarkable performance in the mountains coming in three seconds behind Grezet and 1:07 behind Fignon as Hinault just couldn't find his legs in the mountains as he had done so many times before crossing the line in 9th place losing another 2:58 to Fignon. Stage nineteen was more of the mountains and this time Arroyo was able to ride off the front and claim the win, by 1:14 ahead of the group of favorites who all followed Sean Kelly across the line with the same time. Stage twenty was the last chance for riders to gain time in the mountains, but the only one who won time was the leader Fignon, who put his stamp of authority on the 1984 Tour by winning the stage eleven seconds ahead of Arroyo and seventeen seconds ahead of Pablo Wilches all while adding another 1:17 to his lead over Hinault.\n\nWith the heavy climbing finished Fignon had an all but insurmountable lead over Hinault of 9:56, and LeMond was only 1:13 behind Hinault. Stage twenty-one was back to the flatlands where the always gutsy, prideful and spirited Hinault decided to work his way to the front of the pack and bang elbows with the sprinters fighting it out for the stage win. Despite the fact the Tour was lost, yet Hinault continued charging on and fighting for stage wins, is part of the reason his popularity soared even higher than it already was with racing fans during the 1984 Tour. This time however, it was the sprinter Frank Hoste winning the day beating out Kelly, Hanegraaf and Hinault. During the final ITT in stage twenty-two Fignon and Sean Kelly finished with the same time, but the tiebreaker went to Fignon giving him the official win as he claimed enough time over Hinault to put his margin of victory over 10:00. LeMond finished in 4th place, and in the process secured both the final podium position, as well as his place as a legitimate GC contender proving he could compete with the best of the best during cycling's version of the Super Bowl. During the final stage in Paris, one of the most coveted sprinter’s stages in the sport, Hoste, Kelly and the fiery Hinault once again made their way to the front of the pack during the final lap around the Champs Elysees, but none of these riders would claim the coveted prize. Instead it was the Belgian rider Eric Vanderaerden (who along with Marc Demeyer, Freddy Maertens, Michel Pollentier, Johan De Muynck and Fons de Wolf was given the impossible to live up to task of following the legend Eddy Merckx) who won the day clinching his second stage win of the Tour, and one of the highlight wins of his entire career.\n\nGreg LeMond took the young rider classification, Belgian cyclist Frank Hoste won the points classification, British Robert Millar won the mountains classification and Laurent Fignon would win a total of five stages as he won the Tour with a ten-minute margin. With his air of indifference in interviews and his crushing dominance, he was hailed as France's newest superstar. He even made the claim that some of the attacks Hinault made against him were laughable and that he easily caught back up to him, but this would be the second and final Tour de France win of Fignon’s career. Hinault meanwhile, would sign LeMond to his La Vie Claire team in the offseason by visiting him at his home in the Sierra Nevadas, and win his fifth Tour the following year.\n\nThere were several classifications in the 1984 Tour de France, six of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\n\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, where cyclists were given points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\n\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either \"hors catégorie\", first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\n\nThere was also a combination classification. This classification was calculated as a combination of the other classifications.\n\nAnother classification was the young rider classification. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders that rode the Tour for the first time were eligible, and the leader wore a white jersey.\n\nBefore the 1984 Tour, the intermediate sprints classification did not have a jersey. In the 1984 Tour, the organisers gave the leader of the classification a red jersey to wear. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints.\n\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow caps. There was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps.\n\nIn addition, there was a combativity award, in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after certain stages to the cyclist they considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. At the conclusion of the Tour, Bernard Hinault won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 18. This prize was won by Francisco Rodríguez Maldonado.\n\n\n"}

Diehr, 450 U.S. 175 (1981), was a United States Supreme Court decision which held that controlling the execution of a physical process, by running a computer program did not preclude patentability of the invention as a whole. The high court reiterated its earlier holdings that mathematical formulas in the abstract could not be patented, but it held that the mere presence of a software element did not make an otherwise patent-eligible machine or process patent ineligible. \"Diehr\" was the third member of a trilogy of Supreme Court decisions on the patent-eligibility of computer software related inventions.\n\nThe inventors, respondents, filed a patent application for a \"[process] for molding raw, uncured synthetic rubber into cured precision products.\" The process of curing synthetic rubber depends on a number of factors including time, temperature and thickness of the mold. Using the Arrhenius equation\nformula_1<br>\nwhich may be restated as \"ln\"(\"v\") = \"CZ\" + \"x\" \nit is possible to calculate when to open the press and to remove the cured, molded rubber. The problem was that there was, at the time the invention was made, no disclosed way to obtain an accurate measure of the temperature without opening the press. In the traditional method the temperature of the mold press, which was apparently set at a fixed temperature and was controlled by thermostat, fluctuated due to the opening and closing of the press.\n\nThe invention solved this problem by using embedded thermocouples to constantly check the temperature, and then feeding the measured values into a computer. The computer then used the Arrhenius equation to calculate when sufficient energy had been absorbed so that the molding machine should open the press.\n\nIndependent claim 1 of the allowed patent is representative. It provides:\n\n1. A method of operating a rubber-molding press for precision molded compounds with the aid of a digital computer, comprising:\n\nThe patent examiner rejected this invention as unpatentable subject matter under 35 U.S.C. 101. He argued that the steps performed by the computer were unpatentable as a computer program under \"Gottschalk v. Benson\". The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences of the USPTO affirmed the rejection. The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (CCPA), the predecessor to the current Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, reversed, noting that an otherwise patentable invention did not become unpatentable simply because a computer was involved.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court granted the petition for certiorari by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to resolve this question.\n\nThe Court repeated its earlier holding that mathematical formulas in the abstract are not eligible for patent protection. But it also held that a physical machine or process which makes use of a mathematical algorithm is different from an invention which claims the algorithm, as such, in the abstract. Thus, if the invention as a whole meets the requirements of patentability—that is, it involves \"transforming or reducing an article to a different state or thing\"—it is patent-eligible, even if it includes a software component.\n\nThe CCPA's reversal of the patent rejection was affirmed. But the Court carefully avoided overruling \"Benson\" or \"Flook\". It did criticize the analytic methodology of \"Flook\", however, by challenging its use of analytic dissection, which the \"Flook\" Court based on \"Neilson v. Harford\". The \"Diehr\" Court cited the Senate Report and the CCPA Decision in In re Bergy, 596 F.2d 952, 961 (CCPA 1979) to hold that (a) claims must be considered \"as a whole,\" just as they are for all other patentability determinations, without extracting a \"gist\" or \"point of novelty\" to be considered in isolation, and (b) section 101 governs \"the kind of subject matter\" that can be patented, while concerns for novelty and non-obviousness are considered separately under sections 102 and 103:\n\nThe patent that issued after the decision was U.S. Patent 4,344,142, \"Direct digital control of rubber molding presses.\" The patent includes 11 method claims, three of which are independent. All method claims relate to molding of physical articles. The only diagrams in the patent are flowcharts. There are no diagrams of machinery. As the dissenting opinion in \"Diehr\" noted, the patent specification \"teaches nothing about the chemistry of the synthetic rubber-curing process, nothing about the raw materials to be used in curing synthetic rubber, nothing about the equipment to be used in the process, and nothing about the significance or effect of any process variable such as temperature, curing time, particular compositions of material, or mold configurations.\"\n\nFor many years, it was believed that \"Diehr\" effectively overruled \"Flook\", despite the majority opinion's avoiding any such statement.\n\nIn 2012, in \"Mayo v. Prometheus\", the unanimous opinion of the Supreme Court interpreted \"Diehr\" so as to harmonize it with \"Flook\". The Court \"found the overall process patent eligible because of the way the additional steps of the process [besides the equation] integrated the equation into the process as a whole.\" The Court \"nowhere suggested that all these steps, or at least the combination of those steps, were in context obvious, already in use, or purely conventional.\" \"These other steps apparently added to the formula something that in terms of patent law’s objectives had significance—they transformed the process into an inventive application of the formula.\"\n\nThe Court interpreted \"Diehr\" slightly differently in \"Alice v. CLS Bank\", another unanimous opinion, but without taking issue with the \"Mayo\" interpretation. The \"Alice\" Court said:\nIn \"Diehr\", by contrast [with \"Flook\"], we held that a computer-implemented process for curing rubber was patent eligible, but not because it involved a computer. The claim employed a \"well-known\" mathematical equation, but it used that equation in a process designed to solve a technological problem in \"conventional industry practice.\" The invention in \"Diehr\" used a \"thermocouple\" to record constant temperature measurements inside the rubber mold — something \"the industry ha[d] not been able to obtain.\" The temperature measurements were then fed into a computer, which repeatedly recalculated the remaining cure time by using the mathematical equation. These additional steps, we recently explained, \"transformed the process into an inventive application of the formula.\" \"Mayo\", \"supra\", at ___, 132 S.Ct., at 1299. In other words, the claims in \"Diehr\" were patent eligible because they improved an existing technological process, not because they were implemented on a computer.\n\nThese two opinions state the current Supreme Court interpretation of what the \"Diehr\" case holds.\n\n\n"}

It was created in 1964 as the House of Assembly of Papua and New Guinea but gained its current name after the nation was granted independence in 1975.\n\nThe 111 members of parliament serve five-year terms, 89 of whom are chosen from single-member \"open\" electorates, which are sometimes referred to as \"seats\" but are officially known as constituencies. The remaining 22 are chosen from single-member provincial electorates: the 20 provinces, the autonomous province of Bougainville (North Solomons), and the National Capital District. Each provincial member becomes governor of their province unless they take a ministerial position, in which case the governorship passes to an open member of the province.\n\nFrom 1964 until 1977 an Optional Preferential Voting System was used. The first past the post system was used from 1977 until 2002. Electoral reforms introduced by former Prime Minister Mekere Morauta introduced Limited Preferential Voting, in which voters numbered three preferred candidates. LPV was first used nationally in the 2007 election.\n\nAs in other Commonwealth realms, the party or coalition with the most seats in the parliament is invited by the Governor-General to form a government, and its leader subsequently becomes Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea. The Prime Minister then appoints his cabinet from fellow parliament members. Members of parliament are seated in a similar manner to other Westminster system parliaments, but use chairs instead of benches.\n\nPapua New Guinea has a fractious political culture, and no party in the history of parliament has yet won a majority. Therefore, negotiations between parties have always been necessary to form governments. New governments are protected from votes of no confidence during their first 18 months and during the last 12 months before a national election. More recently, in a move aimed at further minimizing no-confidence motions, then-Prime Minister Mekere Morauta introduced changes that prevented members of the government from voting in favour of such a motion.\n\nAll citizens over the age of 18 may vote, although voting is not compulsory.\n\n"}

Both names translate literally to \"Japanese stringed instrument.\"\n\nAccording to Shintō myth as written in the \"Kojiki\", the \"yamatogoto\" played an important role in the origins of Japan itself. In the myth, Amaterasu, goddess of the sun, is insulted by her brother Susano-o no Mikoto and hides in a cave, refusing to emerge. The world is therefore plunged into darkness. Amaterasu is eventually coaxed out of her cave by the goddess Ame no Uzume, who performs a dance outside the cave, to music provided by the twanging of six hunting bows. Amused by the music, and by the entertained sounds of the other gods, Amaterasu leaves the cave and returns to the firmament. The six bows are lashed together to form an instrument, and the first \"wagon\" or \"yamatogoto\" is born.\n\nThe instrument's form has changed very little since the eighth century. Similar in shape to the more commonly known \"koto\", the \"yamatogoto\" is narrower, as it has fewer strings. Bridges are made from the natural forks of tree branches, particularly maple trees, according to tradition. Unlike many instruments, the \"yamatogoto's\" strings are not arranged in a scale, from low to high pitch, but in a preset melodic sequence which is played in rhythmic patterns. Another common playing technique involves a quick glissando across all the strings, with all but the last string played immediately muted with the hand, thus allowing only the last string to resonate.\n\nToday, the instrument is used only in the Shintō ceremonial/court music called gagaku, and even then it is not common. Nevertheless, its central role in Japanese mythology allows it to retain some reverence.\n\n"}
{"id": "2286631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2286631", "title": "Techniscope", "text": "Techniscope\n\nTechniscope or 2-perf is a 35 mm motion picture camera film format introduced by Technicolor Italia in 1960. The Techniscope format uses a two film-perforation negative pulldown per frame, instead of the standard four-perforation frame usually exposed in 35 mm film photography. Techniscope's 2.33:1 aspect ratio is easily cropped to the 2.39:1 widescreen ratio, because it uses half the amount of 35 mm film stock \"and\" standard spherical lenses. Thus, Techniscope release prints are made by anamorphosizing and enlarging each frame by a factor of two.\n\nDuring its primary reign of 1960–1980, more than 350 films were photographed in Techniscope, the first of which was \"The Pharaoh's Woman\", released 10 December 1960. Given its considerable savings in production cost but lesser image quality, Techniscope was primarily an alternative format used by low-budget film makers, mainly in the horror and western genres. Since the format originated in Italy, most Techniscope format films were European productions.\n\nIn the U.S., Techniscope was used in the low-budget A.C. Lyles Westerns for Paramount Pictures, as well as in a few Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer pictures as well, and Universal Studios briefly used it extensively in the mid to late 1960s. Producer Sid Pink recalled that unlike Europe, the American film studios were charged by the Technicolor company for using Techniscope in their film prints. George Lucas shot his first two features, \"THX 1138\" and \"American Graffiti\", in Techniscope in order to give them a gritty, documentary-like feel.\n\nRegarding the diminished image quality, film reviewer Roger Ebert wrote about the film \"Counterpoint\" (1968): \"The movie is shot in Techniscope, a process designed to give a wide-screen picture while saving film and avoiding payment of royalties to the patented processes like Panavision. In this film, as in 'Harry Frigg', Techniscope causes washed-out color and a loss of detail. Universal shouldn't be so cheap.\"\n\nRecent films shot with 2-perf 35 mm \"Techniscope\" include \"I'm Yours\" (2012), \"Silver Linings Playbook\" (2012), \"Argo\" (2012), and \"Too Late\" (2015).\n\nTechniscope employs standard 35 mm camera films, which are suitable for 2-perf (Techniscope), 3-perf, conventional 4-perf (spherical or CinemaScope), and even 6-perf (Cinerama) and 8-perf (VistaVision), as all of those processes listed employ the same camera and intermediate films, and positive print films intended for direct projection (although 2-, 3- and 8-perfs are not distribution formats).\n\nIn 1999, in Australia, MovieLab film laboratory owner Kelvin Crumplin revived the Techniscope format renamed as MultiVision 235, attempting to commercialise it as a cinematography format alternative to the Super 16 mm format. His proposition was that it yielded a 35 mm-quality image (from which could be derived natural 2.35:1 and 1.85:1 aspect ratio images) for the same cost as Super 16 mm cinematography.\n\nMr Crumplin established MovieLab to provide telecine and film processing and printing services, and, with engineer Bruce McNaughton of The Aranda Group, Victoria, Australia, engineered and produced Arriflex BL1 and Arriflex IIC 35 mm cameras for the Techniscope 2-perf format.\n\nAaton, Panavision, and Arriflex have modern 2-perf cameras either available now or soon to be released (12/2007). Aranda in Australia is also currently converting cameras like Arriflex 2A/B/C Arri 3, Arri BL, Mitchell, Eclair, Moviecam. The Russian cameras, Kinor and Konvas are also converted.\n\nFactory-made kits for certain Mitchell and Mitchell-derived cameras are occasionally available on auction sites. In the specific case of a Mitchell, the kit includes a replacement aperture plate and cam for the film movement, a replacement gear for the camera body, and, for a reflex camera, a replacement focusing screen. As all Mitchell cameras incorporate the provision for a \"hard mask\" within the movement itself, it is often possible to keep the 4-perf aperture plate, and insert a 2-perf mask in the mask slot, as an economy measure.\n\nIn 2011, Lomography released a movie camera, the Lomokino, capable of making short movies on standard 35 mm still photography film which uses a frame format similar to Techniscope, with two perforations for each exposure, though with no space or capabilities for the sound track, taking 144 frames on a 36 exposures roll. The camera is erroneously labeled as being \"Super 35\", Super 35 having three perforations per frame. Movies made with the Lomokino may not show properly without modifications on Techniscope projectors, the Lomokino is hand cranked and the frame rate is controlled manually, usually being around 2-6 FPS.\n\nTechniscope's advantages over anamorphic CinemaScope are:\n\n\nTechniscope's disadvantages against CinemaScope:\n\n\nNote: When transferring a Techniscope film to a digital video format, the 2-perf negative or 2-perf interpositive A/B rolls can be used (the original film negative from the camera, or the first-generation film elements prepared for the making of the anamorphic 4-frame 35 mm release print negative), thus bypassing any blown-up 4-perf element. Many DVD editions have been transferred this way and the results have frequently been stunning, e.g. Blue Underground's \"The Bird with the Crystal Plumage\" and MGM's special editions of Sergio Leone's Westerns.\n\n\n\n(Wayback Machine copy)\n(Wayback Machine copy)\n"}

The aim of this teaching is to improve communication and foster unity among peoples and nations. The Baháʼí teachings state, however, that the international auxiliary language should not suppress existing natural languages, and that the concept of unity in diversity must be applied to preserve cultural distinctions. The Baha'i principle of an International Auxiliary Language (IAL) represents a paradigm for establishing peaceful and reciprocal relations between the world's primary speech communities -- while shielding them from undue linguistic pressures from the dominant speech community/communities.\n\nBaha’u’llah “\"Now praise be to God that Dr. Zamenhof has invented the Esperanto language. It has all the potential qualities of becoming the international means of communication. All of us must be grateful and thankful to him for this noble effort; for in this way he has served his fellowmen well. With untiring effort and self-sacrifice on the part of its devotees, Esperanto will become universal. Therefore, every one of us must study this language and spread it as far as possible\".” - ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, In: Dr. John Esslemont, Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era, p. 182 (2006 ed.). “\"Therefore I hope that you will make the utmost effort, so that this language of Esperanto may be widely spread\".” - Abdu’l-Bahá in Paris, France, in: Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era, p.183.\n\n\"\"Bahá’ís shall consider the study of this language [Esperanto] as an incumbent duty upon them and it will be to them a religious duty\".” - Abdu’l-Bahá, In: \"The Greatest Instrument,\" p. 15. George Ronald, Oxford 2015.\n\n\"\"All through America I have encouraged the Bahá'ís to study Esperanto; and to the extent of my ability I will strive in its spread and promotion\".\" ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in \"Star of the West\", 1912 \n\nMark Vernon in his renowned secular work \"\"Chambers Dictionary of Beliefs and Religions\"\" also observed the links between the Baha'i faith, Esperantism and Esperanto. \n\nThe teachings of the Baháʼí Faith have a strong focus on the unity of humankind. The Baháʼí teachings see improved communication between peoples throughout the world as a vital part of world unity and peace. The Baháʼí teachings see the current multiplicity of languages as a major impediment to unity, since the existence of so many languages cuts the free flow of information and makes it difficult for the average individual to obtain a universal perspective on world events.\n\nThe principle of the selection and institutionalization of a Universal/International Auxiliary Language is among the Baháʼí Faith's key tenets. Baháʼuʼlláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, writing in the Tablets of Ishráqát and Maqṣúd, taught that the lack of a common language is a major barrier to world unity since the lack of communication between peoples of different languages undermines efforts toward world peace due to misunderstandings of language; he urged that humanity should choose an auxiliary language that would be taught in schools in addition to one's own native language, so that people could understand one another. He stated that until an auxiliary language is adopted, complete unity between the various parts of the world would continue to be unrealized. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, called the promotion of the principle of the international auxiliary language \"the very first service to the world of man\" and its realization as \"the greatest achievement of the age in conferring profit and pleasure on mankind.\"\n\nBaháʼuʼlláh stressed, however, that the auxiliary language should not suppress existing natural languages, and that the concept of \"unity in diversity\" must be applied to languages. The Baháʼí teachings state that cultural heterogeneity is compatible with unity, and that the Baháʼí teaching of unity requires the embracing of cultural diversity since humanity is enriched by the various cultures throughout the world. The Baháʼí teachings state that having an international auxiliary language would remove the pressure from the natural aggrandizement of majority language groups and thus preserve minority languages, since each person would keep their own mother-tongue, and thus minority cultures.\n\nNeither Baháʼí literature, nor any of the various Baháʼí authorities, have specified which language should be used as global auxiliary. The Baháʼí writings state that any natural or constructed language may be selected. The predominant language of the time is not necessarily to be used as the auxiliary language by default. The Baháʼí writings stipulate that the auxiliary language is to be selected or invented by the world's parliaments and rulers, thus placing the choice of language in the hands of language planners. Baháʼuʼlláh states that a \"world language will either be invented or chosen from among existing languages\" and: \n\nVarious Baháʼí leaders have made various comments to certain languages and qualities. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi made occasional comments favorable to the notion that potential auxiliary languages be simple and easy to learn. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá also praised the ideal of Esperanto, a constructed language, and there was an affinity between Esperantists and Baháʼís during the late 19th century and early 20th century. While ʻAbdu'l-Bahá encouraged people to learn Esperanto, he never stated that it should become the auxiliary language.\n\nOn February 12, 1913, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá gave a talk to the Paris Esperanto Society,\n\nNow, praise be to God that Dr. Zamenhof has invented the Esperanto language. It has all the potential qualities of becoming the international means of communication. All of us must be grateful and thankful to him for this noble effort; for in this way he has served his fellowmen well. With untiring effort and self-sacrifice on the part of its devotees Esperanto will become universal. Therefore every one of us must study this language and spread it as far as possible so that day by day it may receive a broader recognition, be accepted by all nations and governments of the world, and become a part of the curriculum in all the public schools. I hope that Esperanto will be adopted as the language of all the future international conferences and congresses, so that all people need acquire only two languages—one their own tongue and the other the international language. Then perfect union will be established between all the people of the world. Consider how difficult it is today to communicate with various nations. If one studies fifty languages one may yet travel through a country and not know the language. Therefore I hope that you will make the utmost effort, so that this language of Esperanto may be widely spread.\n\nAlso both Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice, the governing body of the Baháʼís, emphasized that there is no official Baháʼí endorsement of Esperanto as the international auxiliary language. Today there exists an active sub-community of Baháʼí Esperantists; the Baháʼí Esperanto-League was founded in 1973, and Lidia Zamenhof, daughter of Esperanto creator L. L. Zamenhof, was a Baháʼí. Ehsan Yarshater, the founding editor of \"Encyclopædia Iranica\", notes how as a child in Iran he learned Esperanto and that when his mother was visiting Haifa on a Baháʼí pilgrimage he wrote her a letter in Persian as well as Esperanto. At the request of ʻAbdu'l-Baha, Agnes Baldwin Alexander became an early advocate of Esperanto and used it to spread the Baháʼí teachings at meetings and conferences in Japan. James Ferdinand Morton, Jr., an early member of the Baháʼí Faith in Greater Boston, was vice-president of the Esperanto League for North America.\n\nThe selection of the existing language or the creation of a new one each have their advantages; the selection of an existing language allows for a certain portion of the world's population to have already learnt it, but using an invented language would presumably have the advantage of being emotionally neutral.\n\nThe Baháʼí teachings on an auxiliary international language does not in itself threaten living languages or cultures; they do not call for cultural uniformity. Instead, the Baháʼí teachings value and promote cultural diversity by stating that there should be \"unity in diversity\". The term \"auxiliary\" in Baháʼí scripture means that the international language will be taught in addition to first languages and that it will be secondary to those. Since the auxiliary language is meant for community-external, inter-community communication, it is functionally separate from one's primary language. While secondary to the primary language of one's culture, it establishes reliable communication between members of differing primary speech communities.\n\nThe Baháʼí teachings see minority group members as full members of the broader society, and thus see the need for unique cultural rights. Language is strongly attached to culture. In Baháʼí literature, one's mother tongue is described as \"the most profound characteristic of a people\", \"the garment of the spirit of the people\", the \"native air which we need for living and dying, which surrounds us from cradle to grave, which is and remains our most personal property.\" Whereas both cultural and linguistic change are normal and ever-greater world unity expected, the precipitous extinction of non-dominant languages and cultures is therefore undesirable. Since the Baháʼí teachings on oneness of humankind emphasize the value of both diversity and unity in the sense of harmony rather than simple sameness, minority cultural rights can be seen as a matter of cultural justice, and language rights a subset of those cultural rights.\n\n\n"}

It is operated by United States Coast Guard but is funded by the 13 nations interested in trans-Atlantic navigation. As of 2011 the governments contributing to the International Ice Patrol include Belgium, Canada (see Canadian Ice Service), Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Panama, Poland, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nThe organization was established in 1914 in response to the sinking of RMS \"Titanic\". The primary mission of the Ice Patrol is to alert any seacraft traveling the great circle shipping lanes between Europe and the major ports of the United States and Canada of the presence of any icebergs there. \n\nFrom the earliest journeys into the North Atlantic, icebergs have threatened vessels. A review of the history of navigation prior to the turn of the 20th century shows an impressive number of casualties occurred in the vicinity of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. For example, sank in 1833 with a loss of 215 people. Between 1882 and 1890, 14 vessels were lost and 40 seriously damaged due to ice. This does not include the large number of whaling and fishing vessels lost or damaged by ice. It took one of the greatest marine disasters of all time to arouse public demand for international cooperative action to deal with this marine hazard. This disaster, the sinking of on 15 April 1912, was the prime impetus for the establishment of the International Ice Patrol.\n\nOn her maiden voyage from Southampton, England bound for New York, \"Titanic\" collided with an iceberg just south of the tail of the Grand Banks and sank in less than three hours. The loss of life was enormous with more than 1,500 of the 2,224 passengers and crew perishing. \"Titanic\", the brand new ship of the White Star Line, was the largest passenger liner of her time displacing 45,000 tons and capable of sustained speed in excess of . The loss of \"Titanic\" gripped the world with a sobering awareness of an iceberg's potential for tragedy. The sheer dimensions of the \"Titanic\" disaster created sufficient public reaction on both sides of the Atlantic to prod reluctant governments into action, producing the first Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) convention in 1914. \n\nAfter the \"Titanic\" disaster, the U.S. Navy assigned the cruisers and to patrol the Grand Banks of Newfoundland for the remainder of 1912. In 1913, the United States Navy could not spare ships for this purpose, so the Revenue Cutter Service (forerunner of the United States Coast Guard) assumed responsibility, assigning USRC \"Seneca\" and USRC \"Miami\" to conduct the patrol.\n\nAt the first International Conference on the Safety of Life at Sea, which was convened in London on 12 November 1913, the subject of patrolling the ice regions was thoroughly discussed. The convention signed on 30 January 1914, by the representatives of the world's various maritime powers, provided for the inauguration of an international derelict-destruction, ice observation, and ice patrol service, consisting of vessels, which should patrol the ice regions during the season of iceberg danger and attempt to keep the trans-Atlantic lanes clear of derelicts during the remainder of the year. Due primarily to the experience gained in 1912 and 1913, the United States Government was invited to undertake the management of the triple service, the expense to be defrayed by the 13 nations interested in trans-Atlantic navigation.\n\nThe second International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea was convened in London on 16 April 1929. Eighteen nations participated, all of which signed the final act on 31 May 1929. Because of the fear in the United States Senate as a result of ambiguities in Article 54 dealing with control, the 1929 convention was not ratified by the United States until 7 August 1936, and even then the ratification was accompanied by three reservations. At the same time, Congress enacted legislation on 25 June 1936, formally requiring the Commandant of the Coast Guard to administer the International Ice Observation and Ice Patrol Service (Chap. 807, para. 2 49 USC 1922) and describing in general fashion the manner in which this service was to be performed. With only minor changes, this remains today as the basic Coast Guard authority to operate the International Ice Patrol. Since 1929, there have been three SOLAS conventions (1948, 1960 & 1974). None of these have recommended any basic change affecting the Ice Patrol.\n\nEvery year since 1914, the United States Coast Guard and the International Ice Patrol lay a wreath from a ship or an aircraft at the site of the \"Titanic\" disaster on 15 April. The solemn ceremony is attended by the craft's crew and a dedication statement to the \"Titanic\" and her lost passengers is read.\n\nFrom its inception until the beginning of World War II, the Ice Patrol was conducted from two surface patrol cutters alternating surveillance patrols of the southern ice limits. In 1931 and thereafter a third ship was assigned to Ice Patrol to perform oceanographic observations in the vicinity of the Grand Banks. After World War II, aerial surveillance became the primary ice reconnaissance method with surface patrols phased out except during unusually heavy ice years or extended periods of reduced visibility. Use of the oceanographic vessel continued until 1982, when the Coast Guard's sole remaining oceanographic ship, , was converted to a medium endurance cutter. The aircraft has distinct advantages for ice reconnaissance providing much greater coverage in a relatively short period of time.\n\nFrom 1946 until 1966, the Ice Patrol offices, operations center and reconnaissance aircraft were based at the Coast Guard Air Detachment Argentia, Newfoundland during the ice season.\n\nDue to changing operational commitments and financial constraints the Coast Guard Argentia Air Detachment closed in 1966. Ice Patrol headquarters and operations center moved to Governors Island, New York where they remained until October 1983. \n\nToday the International Ice Patrol is located at the Coast Guard Research and Development Center in New London, Connecticut. The ice reconnaissance detachment, usually composed of eleven aircrew and four ice observers flying in an HC-130 aircraft, continues to work out of Newfoundland.\n\nThe Ice Patrol disseminates information on icebergs and the limit of all known sea ice via radio broadcast from the U.S. Coast Guard Communications Command (COMMCOM) located in Chesapeake, Virginia via Inmarsat Safetynet, and radio facsimile chart. Ice Patrol information is also available via Internet access. 2002 changes to SOLAS requires ships transiting the region guarded by the Ice Patrol to use the services provided during the ice season.\n\n\n"}

He was known primarily as a portraitist and for a number of female nudes in outdoor settings that he painted during the 1930s.\n\nHolgate's family moved to Jamaica in 1895 where his father worked as an engineer. In 1897 he was sent to Toronto to go to school. In 1901 his family returned from Jamaica and settled in Montreal.\n\nHolgate studied at the Art Association of Montreal under William Brymner (who also taught A. Y.

Sean Kelly of Ireland won the points classification, and Lucien Van Impe of Belgium won the mountains classification.\n\nThe Tour organisation wanted to globalize cycling by having cyclist from the Eastern Bloc in the Tour. Because they only rode as amateurs, the 1983 Tour was also opened for amateur teams. In the end, only the Colombian and Portuguese national amateur teams applied for a place, and the Portuguese team later withdrew. The 1983 Tour started with 140 cyclists, divided into 14 teams of 10 cyclists.\n\nThe teams entering the race were:\n\nThe 1983 Tour de France started on 1 July, and had one rest day, after the finish on the Alpe d'Huez. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet mountain pass on stage 10.\n\nIn 1983, Fignon was a part of the team that helped Bernard Hinault to win the 1983 Vuelta a España. Guimard did not want to send Fignon to the Tour de France, because two grand tours could be too much for a 22-year-old rider. When Hinault, winner of four of five previous Tours, announced that he would not start due to injury, the Renault team was without a team captain. Fignon was added to the 1983 Tour de France selection for the Renault team, and the team decided to go for stage wins, with hopes of having Fignon or Marc Madiot compete for the young rider classification. After stage nine, the first mountain stage, Fignon was in second place, behind Pascal Simon, and he was allowed to be team leader. In the eleventh stage, Simon crashed and broke his shoulder blade. Simon continued, and only lost little time the next stages. In the fifteenth stage, a mountain time trial, Fignon was able to win back so much time that he was within one minute of Simon.\n\nIn the seventeenth stage, Simon had to give up, and Fignon became the new leader. In the next stages, Fignon was able to answer all attacks from his opponents, and he even won the time trial in the 21st stage. At 22 years old, Fignon was the youngest man to win the Tour since 1933.\n\nFignon later said that he was lucky to have won the 1983 Tour: if Hinault would have been present, Fignon would have helped Hinault, as Hinault was the team leader.\n\nThere were several classifications in the 1983 Tour de France, four of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\n\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, where cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\n\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either \"hors catégorie\", first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\n\nAnother classification was the young rider classification. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders that rode the Tour for the first time were eligible, and the leader wore a white jersey.\n\nThe fifth individual classification was the intermediate sprints classification. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints. In 1983, this classification had no associated jersey.\n\nThe team classification changed; in 1982 it was calculated with the times of the best four cyclists in every stage, and in 1983 this changed to the times of the best three cyclists. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow caps. There was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps.\n\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass-start stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Serge Demierre won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Tourmalet on stage 10.

These are found on either side of the foot protruding above the level of the coronary band. The lateral cartilages support the hoof wall and provide an important role in the support and cushioning provided to the heel. The front feet are most commonly affected.\n\nRepeated concussion of the foot is probably the cause in many cases. Such concussion could be produced when a horse is always worked on a hard surface. There also appears to be a hereditary component to sidebone but this may be because bad conformation is hereditary and bad conformation appears to predispose to sidebone. Bad conformation would include\n\n\nSidebone may be associated with lameness but many horses with sidebone are not lame. It follows that sidebone often gets blamed for being the cause of lameness when there is actually another cause. \n\nCareful examination of the collateral cartilages by palpation can give a good indication that they are solid and bony rather than firm, springy cartilage. Usually, however, sidebone is found accidentally when the foot is radiographed, as sidebone has few outward signs in most cases. In mild cases, there are small areas of calcification; more advanced cases will have ossification of the entire cartilage. Rarely, severe lameness can be caused by fracture of an ossified cartilage, or by ossification which deviates enough to impinge on the short pastern bone.\n\nSidebone usually does not cause any problems, but when it does it is difficult to treat. Box rest and Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as bute may be useful. In some cases the only useful treatment is a neurectomy of the palmar digital nerves.\n\nMany horses compete actively in demanding sports with sidebone, and are not hindered in any way. If the ossification is severe and associated with lameness then the prognosis is more guarded. Discovery of sidebone on an equine prepurchase exam without signs of lameness or local sensitivity should not affect the purchaser's opinion of the horse.\n"}

He was one of the most brilliant personages of his day, and the most prominent representative of French culture in Sweden. He was also a fine orator.\n\nTessin's art collection became the original core of the collection of Sweden's Nationalmuseum.\n\nCarl Gustaf Tessin was born in Stockholm. His father's family were burghers, while his mother came from the nobility; one of his maternal great-great-grandmothers had been born a princess-duchess of Brunswick-Luneburg. This genealogy led some to regard him as \"trash\" and a social climber compared to real aristocracy. On the other hand, members of his paternal line had shown high talent artistically and aesthetically; designers, architects, and also political talent. He married Ulrika Sparre in 1727.\n\nHe began his public career in 1723, at which time he was a member of the Holstein faction, which promoted the claims of the young Duke Carl Frederick of Holstein to the Swedish throne. In 1725 Tessin was appointed ambassador at Vienna, and in that capacity counteracted the plans of the Swedish chancellor, Count Arvid Horn, for joining the anti-Russian Hanoverian Alliance.\n\nDuring the riksdags of 1726–27 and 1731, Tessin fiercely opposed the government, and his wit, eloquence, and imposing presence made him one of the foremost protagonists of the party subsequently known as \"The Hats\". From 1735 to 1736 he was again Swedish ambassador at Vienna. During the riksdag of 1738 he was elected marshal of the Riksdag of the Estates and contributed more than anyone else to the overthrow of the Horn administration the same year.\nCount\nOn the division of the spoil of patronage he chose for himself the post of ambassador extraordinary at Paris, and from 1739 to 1742 delighted Versailles with his brilliant qualities of grand seigneur, at the same time renewing the traditional alliance between France and Sweden which had been interrupted for more than sixty years. His political ability, however, was by no means commensurate with his splendid social qualities. It was his sanguine credulity which committed the Hats to their rash and unconsidered war with Russia in 1741–42, though in fairness it must be added that Tessin helped them out of their difficulties again by his adroitness as party leader and his stirring eloquence. He gained his seat in the senate as a reward for his services on this occasion. In 1743 Tessin attempted to reconcile the long outstanding differences between Sweden and Denmark in a special mission to Copenhagen.\n\nIn 1744 he was sent at the head of an extraordinary embassade to Berlin to escort to Stockholm Frederick the Great's sister, Louisa Ulrika, the chosen bride of the Swedish crown prince, Adolphus Frederick. As \"överhovmarskalk\" of the young court, Tessin speedily captivated the royal pair. He also succeeded in extricating the crown prince from the influence of the Russian Empress Elizabeth of Russia, to whom Adolphus Frederick owed his throne when he became king of Sweden in 1751, thereby essentially contributing to the maintenance of the independence of Sweden.\n\nHe was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1741. From 1746 to 1752 Tessin was president of the chancellery, as the Swedish prime minister was called in those days. His system aimed at a rapprochement with Denmark with the view of counterbalancing the influence of Russia in the north. It was a dignified and prudent policy, but his endeavour to consolidate it by promoting a matrimonial alliance between the two courts alienated the Swedish crown prince, who, as a Holsteiner, nourished an ineradicable hatred of everything Danish. As, moreover, on the accession of Adolphus Frederick in 1751, Tessin refused to countenance any extension of the royal prerogative, the rupture between him and the court became final. On the occasion of the coronation (1752) he resigned the premiership, and in 1754 the governorship of the young crown prince Gustavus also, spending the rest of his days at his estate at Åkerö Manor, where he died.\n\nHe was given the L’Ordre de l’Harmonie.\n\nCarl Gustaf Tessin was also an art collector. During his mission in Paris he bought many paintings and drawings, including 2000 drawings from the famous 1741 auction of the former Pierre Crozat collection. Being heavily in debt on his return to Sweden, he was obliged to sell part of his collection to the then King Fredrik I, who gave them to Queen Louisa Ulrika. Part of his art collection is now in the Swedish Nationalmuseum.\n\nThe collection was on display in New York at the Morgan Library & Museum, \"Treasures from the Nationalmuseum of Sweden: The Collections of Count Tessin.\"\n\n\n\n"}

This can also be called what-if analysis or back-solving. It can either be attempted through trial and improvement or more logical means. Basic goal seeking functionality is built into most modern spreadsheet packages such as Microsoft Excel.\n\nAccording to O'Brien and Marakas, optimization analysis is a more complex extension of goal-seeking analysis. Instead of setting a specific target value for a variable, the goal is to find the optimum value for one or more target variables, given certain constraints. Then one or more other variables are changed repeatedly, subject to the specified constraints, until you discover the best values for the target variables.\n\nSuppose a family wanted to take out the biggest loan that they could afford to pay for. If they set aside $500 a month, the goal-seeking program would try to work out how big a loan the family could afford to take out. Even using simple trial and improvement, a computer could quickly determine that they could not afford a $50,000 loan, but could afford a $48,000 loan. It would then repeat the process until it had reached a figure such as $48,476.34, which would give them a monthly repayment as close to $500 as possible, without exceeding it.\n\nA more efficient method, especially on more complicated calculations, would be for the program to logically work through the argument. By drawing up a simple equation, the program could come to the conclusion that the output equalled one ninety-sixth of the input, and could then multiply the output (or goal) by ninety-six to find the necessary input.\n\n"}

{"id": "2286723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2286723", "title": "Little Eaton Gangway", "text": "Little Eaton Gangway\n\nThe Little Eaton Gangway, officially the Derby Canal Railway, was a narrow gauge industrial wagonway serving the Derby Canal, in England, at Little Eaton in Derbyshire.\n\nIn 1792, Benjamin Outram was asked to prepare plans for a broad canal from Swarkestone to Smithy Houses, near Denby, with a branch at Derby to the Erewash Canal at Sandiacre, which he estimated would cost £60,000. The original report has been lost in time with only a dated and signed map drawing surviving in Derbyshire Records Office. William Jessop on 3 November 1792 confirmed Outram's proposals. The Derby Canal Act of 1793 authorized a rail connection between the Derby Canal at Little Eaton and the collieries to the north. The wagonway ran four miles (6 km) from the canal wharf to Smithy Houses and another mile further to Denby Hall Colliery. Further short branches served Salterwood North and Henmoor Collieries as well as the Denby Pottery.\n\nThe purpose of this long plateway was to carry coal from Kilburn and Denby down to the canal at Little Eaton and general goods including stone, pottery and \"clogs of wood\".\n\nOutram's original plan was for a conventional waggonway with wooden sleepers and oak rails reinforced with cast iron plates. Accordingly, an advertisement appeared in the \"Lincoln & Stamford Mercury\" for 16 August 1793 for oak sleepers long squared at each end for a length of .\n\nHowever, by the time the railway was approved, Outram had decided to use the flanged rails with which his name has become associated. In this he may have been greatly influenced by William Jessop (1745 to 1814) and also by Joseph Butler of Wingerworth near Chesterfield, who had constructed a similar line in 1788. Butler is believed to have been the first to do so in Derbyshire and supplied the rails, rather than Outram's own works. Outram considered himself the first to use stone blocks as sleepers. These were drilled with a hole into which an oak plug was fitted. The rails of cast iron were usually long (he also manufactured long rails when asked) and of L-shaped cross-section, were attached by means of spikes into a notch at the end of the rail. The line was originally gauge, being increased later to at an unknown date.\n\nThe cast iron plates used to build the track initially weighed although this was increased to for plates made after 1804. By 1825, there were nine passing places on the single-track line, which carried waggons. Each waggon carried a box of coal, with a load of between , which was transferred to a barge at Little Eaton wharf by a crane. From Smithy Houses, several private lines served the Denby Main colliery and other mines in the locality. Further extensions were made between 1827 and 1829, when lines were built to provide links to the colliery owned by Harrison, Pattinson and Davenport at Denby, to Kilburn colliery and to Salterwood pits.\n\nThe waggons, built at Outram's Butterley works consisted of containers mounted loosely on a chassis, or tram, with four cast iron wheels. The container would be lifted off at Little Eaton and loaded complete into narrowboats or transferred to two-wheeled carts for carriage by road. The canal line from Little Eaton led to Gandy's Wharf in Derby for onward distribution through the canal network or by road and was an early example of a containerised system (see Duke of Bridgewater Canal for first use)\n\nThe gangway and the Little Eaton line of the canal opened in 1795 to a great ceremonial fanfare with the wagons being kitted out with seats for the dignitaries and a Band to mark the occasion. The first load of coal from Denby was distributed to the poor of Derby.\n\nWhen the Midland Railway built its branch line to Ripley in 1856, it lost most of its trade, finally closing in 1908.\n\nThe trackbed was used for a new road, the A61, bypassing the old road through Coxbench. This, in turn, was superseded at the end of the twentieth century by the A38 trunk road, demoting it to the B6179. Thus there are three generations of highway side-by-side, plus the remains of the railway.\n\nThe only remaining trace of the gangway is the Wharf building seen in the photo above, the easternmost arch of Jack O' Darley bridge, and another two arch bridge over the Bottle Brook, with a few of the sleeper stones that have been used in nearby walls.

The killings happened after plainclothes officers approached a Standard Vanguard estate car, in which Roberts and two other men were sitting in Braybrook Street near Wormwood Scrubs prison in London. Roberts feared the officers would discover firearms his gang were planning to use in a robbery. He killed two, while one of his accomplices fatally shot the third.\n\nAfter Roberts had spent nearly 48 years in prison, in 2014 the Parole Board for England and Wales approved his release, at the age of 78. Having far exceeded his minimum term of 30 years, he was one of the United Kingdom's longest-serving prisoners, having remained in custody since 1966.\n\nRoberts was born in Wanstead, Essex, on 21 July 1936 where his parents ran The George public house. As a child he became involved in crime by helping his mother sell stolen goods on the black market. Roberts later described how the family owned a café in north London where his mother was \"...selling on mostly food—tea and sugar—and sometimes ration books. Anything she could get her hands on\".\n\nIn his late teens, he was sentenced to detention after using an iron bar to attack a shopkeeper during a robbery. Roberts served a 19-month sentence inside Gaynes Hall borstal, and was released in January 1956.\n\nOne week after leaving the borstal, Roberts was called up for national service and joined the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own), with whom he saw action during the Mau Mau Uprising and Malayan Emergency. Of his service in the jungle he said that this was where he learned to kill and that he had \"personally killed at least four\". Roberts has claimed that he reached the rank of Sergeant while in the Army although others have given his rank as Lance Corporal. Journalist and former armed robber John McVicar has said that Roberts \"gloated\" about his killings while in prison, and had \"acquired a taste for killing prisoners [of war] on the orders of his officers\" in the Army.\n\nAfter leaving the Army, Roberts returned to his criminal activities, and in partnership with Jack Witney carried out \"dozens\" of armed robberies, targeting bookmakers, post offices and banks. He said, \"The most I earned was £1,000 from a single job. Witney was the eldest, the boss: he knew the best places to rob. [John] Duddy joined us later.\" In 1959 Roberts and an accomplice posed as tax inspectors to gain entry into the home of an elderly man. The man was bound, robbed, and beaten about the head with a glass decanter. Roberts was arrested, and at his trial the judge, Mr Justice Maude, said, \"You are a brutal thug. You came very near the rope this time. It is to be hoped you do not appear before us again.\" Roberts received a sentence of seven years.\n\nFollowing the shootings of 41-year-old Police Constable Geoffrey Fox, Detective Sergeant Christopher Head, aged 30, and 25-year-old Temporary Detective Constable David Wombwell, Roberts hid in Thorley Wood near Bishop's Stortford to avoid capture. He was familiar with the area from visits there as a child. A £1,000 reward was offered for information leading to his arrest. Roberts used his military training to evade capture for ninety-six days, but was finally caught by police while sleeping rough in a barn at Blount's Farm near Bishop's Stortford.\n\nRoberts was convicted of all three murders and sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommended minimum term of 30 years. The murders occurred just eight months after the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965 suspended the death penalty in England, Wales and Scotland and substituted a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. While in prison, Roberts made several attempts to escape.\n\nIn 2001, he was moved to an open prison. However, Roberts was returned to a closed prison within months after allegations that he was involved in drug dealing and contraband smuggling. Author Kate Kray, who interviewed Roberts for her book \"Natural Born Killers\" (1999, ), said that he has no remorse for his victims and recreates the murders in art and pastry decorations, making apple pies and decorating them with pastry cut-outs of policemen being shot. Kray said that he also produces \"precisely drawn and coloured\" paintings depicting someone shooting a policeman.\n\nIn 2005 he failed in his appeal to the House of Lords over the use of secret evidence to keep him in prison. The evidence had been obtained by tapping private phone calls between Roberts and his solicitor. The material was then introduced as evidence at his parole hearings.\n\nIn September 2006, 70-year-old Roberts applied for a judicial review over apparent delays by the parole board in reaching a decision to free him by the end of the year. In December 2006, he was again turned down for parole. On 29 June 2007, he was given leave to seek a High Court judicial review over his failed parole bid, with the judge saying his case \"was of great public interest.\"\n\nIt was reported in February 2009 that Harry Roberts hoped to be freed from prison within months, having already served 42 years in jail and completing the first stage of a parole board hearing; he believed this would pave the way for his release. Roberts hoped a final hearing would find that at the age of 72 he was no longer a risk to the public and that the parole board would order his immediate release. At this time he had already served 12 years more than the minimum term recommended by his trial judge who at the time of sentencing told Roberts that it was unlikely that any future Home Secretary would \"ever think fit to show mercy by releasing you on licence... This is one of those cases in which the sentence of imprisonment for 'life' may well be treated as meaning exactly what it says\". It was recognised that government ministers were concerned that any decision on the matter would provoke public fury and that Roberts' safety might be put at risk but the parole board would nonetheless be powerless to halt the release.\n\nSupporters of Roberts had previously claimed that successive Home Secretaries have blocked his release for political reasons because of fears of a public backlash. Peter Smyth, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said that there would be widespread anger among serving and former officers. Legal sources said they believed that the parole board was likely to recommend that he was eligible for an open prison as a way of preparing him for release. Jack Straw, the former Justice Secretary, retained the power to reject a parole board recommendation that Roberts be moved to an open prison but he could not block a decision by the board to order his release.\n\nIn April 2009 it was alleged that while working at an animal sanctuary on day release, Roberts made violent threats to the owners.\n\nIn October 2014 the Parole Board for England and Wales approved his release at an unspecified later date. Roberts was released on 11 November 2014 after serving 48 years in prison (from 15 November 1966).\n\nRoberts' name has been used for many years to antagonise the police, with chants like \"Harry Roberts is our friend, is our friend, is our friend. Harry Roberts is our friend, he kills coppers. Let him out to kill some more, kill some more, kill some more, let him out to kill some more, Harry Roberts\" as well as \"He shot three down in Shepherd's Bush, Shepherd's Bush, Shepherd's Bush. He shot three down in Shepherd's Bush, our mate Harry\" (to the tune of \"London Bridge Is Falling Down\"), which originated with groups of young people outside Shepherd's Bush police station after Roberts had been arrested.\n\nThere have been artistic representations of Roberts. The character of Billy Porter in the 2001 novel \"He Kills Coppers\" by Jake Arnott, and the 2008 TV adaptation, is based on Harry Roberts.\n\nTo the tune of the chant \"Hari Krishna\", in the song \"Happiness Is Just a Chant Away\" by Chumbawamba on their 1992 album Shhh, the words \"Hari Krishna\" are replaced with \"Harry Roberts\". \n"}

He established communities of Munsee (Lenape) converts to Christianity in the valley of the Muskingum River in Ohio; and for a time, near modern-day Amherstburg, Ontario.\n\nZeisberger was born in Zauchtenthal, Moravia (present day Suchdol nad Odrou in the Czech Republic) and moved with his family to the newly established Moravian Christian community of Herrnhut, on the estate of Count Nicolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf in the German Electorate of Saxony in 1727. However, when his family migrated to the newly established English colony in Georgia, Zeisberger remained in Europe to complete his education. In 1738, he came to Georgia in the United States, with the assistance of governor James Edward Oglethorpe. He later rejoined his family in the Moravian community at Savannah, Georgia. At the time, the United Brethren had begun a settlement, merely for the purpose of preaching the gospel to the Creek nation. From there he moved to Pennsylvania, and assisted at the commencement of the settlements of Nazareth and Bethlehem.\n\nIn 1739, Zeisberger was influential in the development of a Moravian community in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and was there at its dedication on Christmas Eve 1741. Four years later, at the invitation of Hendrick Theyanoguin, he came to live among the Mohawk. He became fluent in the Onondaga language and assisted Conrad Weiser in negotiating an alliance between the English and the Iroquois in Onondaga (near present-day Syracuse, New York). Zeisberger also produced dictionaries and religious works in Iroquoian and Algonquian.\n\nZeisberger began as a missionary to Native American peoples following his ordination as a Moravian minister in 1749. He worked among the Lenape (Delaware) of Pennsylvania, coming into conflict with British authorities over his advocacy of Natives' rights and his ongoing efforts to establish white and native Moravian communities in eastern Ohio. He was the senior missionary of the United Brethren (as the Moravians sometimes referred to themselves) among the Indians. His relations with British authorities worsened during the American Revolutionary War and in 1781 he was arrested and held at Fort Detroit. While he was imprisoned, ninety-six of his Native converts in Gnadenhutten, Ohio were brutally murdered by Pennsylvania militiamen, an event known as the Gnadenhutten Massacre.\n\nAfter Zeisberger was released, violent conflicts with other Native tribes and the expansion of white settlement forced many Moravian Christian settlements to relocate to present-day Michigan and Ontario. A large group of Munsee moved there in 1782, but Zeisberger later returned to live the rest of his life among the Native converts remaining near the village of Goshen (in present Goshen Township, Tuscarawas County, Ohio). Zeisberger spent a period of 62 years, excepting a few short intervals, as a missionary among the Indians. He died on November 17, 1808 at Goshen, Ohio, on the river Tuscarawas, at the age of 87 years. Zeisberger is buried in Goshen.\n\n\n"}

The \"pat kon\" has been absorbed into the traditional musical ensembles of neighboring Southeast Asian societies.\n\nThe instrument is known by various names within the region, including \"la gyan hsaing\" (), \"la gyan kye waing\" (လခြမ်းကြေးဝိုင်း), \"khong mon\" (, ) and \"kong mon\" (). In the Mon language, it is called \"naung not\" () or \"pat kon cao\" (, lit. \"ten child gongs\").\n\nThe \"pat kon\" consists of about a dozen (10 - 15) gongs mounted in a vertical crescent-shaped wooden frame. It produces the same range of pitches as the more common gong circles (such as the Kong toch and \"khong wong\"), but rather than resting on the ground, the wooden frame of this instrument extends into the air in the shape of a horseshoe. The instrument was formerly used in nat (spirit) propitiation ceremonies, and originally consisted of 14 gongs, but a 15th gong was added in 1962, tuned to the fifth note.\n\nThe instrument's wooden frame is made of beechwood (\"Gmelina arborea\"), with rattan used to suspend the individual gongs. The wooden frame is embellished with traditional arabesque or \"kanok\" designs, inlaid with glass mosaic, and carvings depicting a stylized kinnari bird or devas. The image of a half-man, half-bird figure carved onto the frame is traditional, and is meant to symbolize a celestial musician. The frame is also typically decorated lavishly in gold paint and glass mosaic. \"Khong mon\" are featured in a special type of Thai ensemble called \"pi phat\", which plays \"pi phat mon\" or \"pi phat nang hong\" into the mainstream of traditional Thai music as well; \"pi phat mon\" or \"pi phat nang hong\" is usually performed by Thai musicians.\n\n\n"}
