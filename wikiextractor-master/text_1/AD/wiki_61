{"id": "2266273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2266273", "title": "The Saga of Seven Suns", "text": "The Saga of Seven Suns\n\nThe Saga of Seven Suns is a series of seven space opera novels by American writer Kevin J. Anderson, published between 2002 and 2008. The books are set in a not-too-distant future where humans have colonized a number of other planets across the galaxy, thanks in part to technological assistance from an ancient alien race, the Ildirans. The series chronicles the universe-spanning war that erupts when humans inadvertently ignite the fury of a hidden empire of elemental aliens known as the hydrogues. Internal conflict is sparked within both the human and Ildiran empires as other ancient elemental races reappear to renew their own ancient war with the hydrogues.\n\nA sequel trilogy, \" The Saga of Shadows\", includes the novels \"The Dark Between the Stars\" (2014), \"Blood of the Cosmos\" (2015) and \"Eternity's Mind\" (2016).\nIn the future, the human race has colonized multiple planets in the Spiral Arm, most of which are governed by the powerful Terran Hanseatic League (Hansa). Though ostensibly ruled by kings, the Hansa is actually controlled by its Chairman, and the puppet monarchs merely follow orders. Centuries before, several generation ships had set out from Earth to find new worlds; one of these had encountered the Ildirans, an ancient alien race who shared their stardrive technology (which allows faster-than-light travel) and led the humans to habitable planets. The Ildirans themselves, psychically linked to their leader the Mage-Imperator, have become stagnant and eschew both expansion and innovation.\n\nAs the series begins, the arrogant Hansa Chairman Basil Wenceslas begins grooming a replacement for the aging King Frederick. Basil looks to expand the human empire further through the discovery of alien technology from the extinct Klikiss race that will allow scientists to create a new star from a gas giant, turning cold moons into planets ripe for colonization. The most prominent human world aside from Earth is Theroc, a planet covered in semi-sentient worldtrees that is quietly independent from the Hansa. Theroc's \"green priests\" are able to commune with the trees and communicate telepathically across space when touching a treeling, making them indispensable for instantaneous communication across the galaxy. The Roamers are clans of industrious humans living a clandestine existence in the fringes of space, managing a profitable economy centered on the sale of the valuable stardrive fuel ekti and other commodities. The ignition of the gas giant Oncier reveals the existence of the elemental hydrogues, and the inadvertent hydrogue genocide at the hands of the humans incites the ire of the other hidden hydrogue populations across the galaxy. Their brutal retaliation and forced cessation of \"ekti\" collection threaten to cripple both the human and Ildiran civilizations, and serve as an effective declaration of war. The aggression of the hydrogues reawakens the verdani, the worldtree entities who had fled to Theroc after losing an ancient war with the hydrogues. Meanwhile, the Ildiran Mage-Imperator Cyroc'h struggles to hide his race's secrets and keep the centuries-old plan for ultimate Ildiran survival on track. And the amnesiac black Klikiss robots, left behind after their parent race's mysterious destruction, have secrets of their own.\n\nThe war escalates simmering rivalries among the human factions and ignites a schism in the Ildiran consciousness. Later, the fire-based faeros and aquatic wentals also reappear as the war with their ancient hydrogue enemies escalates. The long-held secrets of the Ildirans and the Klikiss robots are revealed amidst much destruction, and after 10,000 years the Klikiss return to reclaim their own empire at any cost.\nHidden Empire is the first book in \"The Saga of Seven Suns\" series by Kevin J. Anderson, published on July 24, 2002. \"Publishers Weekly\" called it a \"stellar launch of a new series\" and a \"fascinating future epic\", and praised its \"engaging characters.\" Harriet Klausner of TheBestReviews.com wrote, \"The tale grabs the audience from the start as Kevin J. Anderson ... blends the players and worlds into the thrilling plot. Thus, the audience does not receive an extended prologue as often seen in first novels. Instead readers obtain a powerful futuristic epic that contains a robust stand-alone story line yet provides a puissant cliffhanger that will keep the audience wanting to continue non-stop.\" However \"SF Signal\" described it as \"A rather pedestrian space opera that nonetheless has some cool ideas.\"\n\nHaving colonized many worlds in the Spiral Arm, humanity is divided into three branches: the Earth-based Terran Hanseatic League (Hansa) and its subordinate planets, the independent world Theroc with its telepathic green priests, and the Roamers, interplanetary traders who prefer starships and hidden bases to a conventional planet-based civilization. The only other known intelligent species in the galaxy are the Ildirans, an ancient civilization at its peak, and the long-extinct Klikiss, whose planets remain empty but for their unusual ruins.\n\nAs the novel begins, the Hansa's test of a recently discovered ancient Klikiss technology that can convert gas giant planets into suns is a success. The ignition of the planet Oncier will eventually make its satellite moons into habitable worlds perfect for human colonization, but it has also murdered millions of hydrogues, a previously-unknown race of gas elementals living in the high-pressure core of the planet. Confined in crystalline globe ships, the hydrogues retaliate by systematically destroying several Roamer skymines, floating factories which harvest the hydrogen used to produce the vital stardrive fuel ekti from the atmosphere of gas giants. The powerful warglobes also destroy the moons of Oncier and the scientific space station there before warning the human race to stay away from all gas giants or be destroyed. This ultimatum is punctuated by the murder of the Hansa's puppet king Frederick and everyone in his vicinity.\n\nAs a lack of ekti will cripple both the human and Ildirian civilizations, and the hydrogues refuse to negotiate or even respond to human overtures of peace, their ultimatum is effectively a declaration of war. The humans and Ildirans mount a defense to protect their interests, but the virtually indestructible hydrogue ships and their lightning and ice weapons seem an unconquerable enemy. Arrogant Hansa Chairman Basil Wenceslas, the real power behind the Hansa, installs the young Prince Peter as Frederick's successor. Hand-picked by Basil from obscurity and specially trained for his role as Hansa figurehead, the new King Peter is soon at odds with the Chairman, whose governing style seems more to Peter like a self-serving consolidation of power than a means to lead the human population in a meaningful way. Meanwhile, the sudden appearance of the hydrogues complicates matters for Ildiran Mage-Imperator Cyroc'h; he and his predecessors have kept the existence of the hydrogues a secret for millennia as they plotted a means to neutralize the threat should the hydrogues return. Cyroc'h's own heir, Prime Designate Jora'h, has fallen in love with the human green priest Nira Khali, and Cyroc'h soon comes to believe that her telepathic abilities could be of use to his failing hydrogue plan.\nA Forest of Stars is the second book in \"The Saga of Seven Suns\" series by Kevin J. Anderson, published on July 17, 2003. Calling Anderson's characters \"well-drawn,\" \"Publishers Weekly\" wrote that the author \"weaves action, romance and science with a rousing plot reflecting the classic SF of Clarke and Herbert and the glossy cinematic influence of Lucas and Spielberg.\"\n\nFive years after the war began, the hydrogues maintain absolute control over the galaxy's gas giant planets. On Earth the government is tightening its grip on rebellious colonies while seeking to dominate the other humans throughout the galaxy, unaware that the seemingly-benign Klikiss robots, left behind when the Klikiss died out, are actually planning the destruction of the human race as they did their parent Klikiss. The Roamer skymines have been abandoned or destroyed, but innovative clans have come up with smash-and-grab tactics to acquire what ekti they can. The worldtrees of Theroc have been revealed as the verdani, ancient rivals of the hydrogues. Though a heartbroken Jora'h believes she is dead, Nira is secretly a captive being used in the clandestine breeding scheme of Mage-Imperator Cyroc'h to create an Ildiran capable of communicating with the hydrogues. So far the best candidate appears to be Osira'h, the secret daughter of Nira and Jora'h. The Hansa begins building military robots (Soldier compies) to fight the war using technology copied from Klikiss robots. Two new races of elemental entities are rediscoveredthe fire-based faeros and aquatic wentalswho join in the war against their ancient enemies, the hydrogues.\nHorizon Storms is the third book in \"The Saga of Seven Suns\" series by Kevin J. Anderson, published on July 29, 2004. \"Publishers Weekly\" wrote that the novel was \"Crackling with energy and buzzing with action,\" calling it \"thrilling\" and a \"hot summer read.\"\n\nThe elemental war between hydrogues and faeros continues to sweep across the Spiral Arm, extinguishing suns and destroying planets. Hansa Chairman Basil Wenceslas (and his figurehead King Peter) attempts to unify all branches of the human race to stand together against the threat, even if they must resort to deception and oppression to do so. The Roamer clans and the people of Theroc do not give up their independence easily, however, and Basil's policies soon force the disparate civilizations to forge alliances of their own. Partly as a distraction from their peril and partly as a desperate hope, the Hansa launches an ambitious new colonization program using the network of recently discovered Klikiss transportals, instantaneous gateways that take colonists to many abandoned Klikiss worlds. On the planet Ildira, newly crowned Mage-Imperator Jora'h faces the responsibilities and secrets his predecessors have imposed upon him: a breeding program forced upon a colony of human captives and an uneasy pact with the Klikiss robots that could result in the extinction of the human race. But Jora'h must also survive an open rebellion among the Ildirans unleashed by his own brother Rusa'h, the first in 10,000 years.\n\nScattered Suns is the fourth book in \"The Saga of Seven Suns\" series by Kevin J. Anderson, published on July 18, 2005. \"Publishers Weekly\" wrote that \"Anderson delivers more on-the-edge-of-your-seat SF thrills\" and that he \"handles a huge cast and complicated plot with élan.\"\n\nIldiran Mage-Imperator Jora'h is preoccupied with the bloody rebellion that his brother Rusa'h has launched across the Ildiran planets, with the help of Jora'h's own first-born son Thor'h. But as the war between the hydrogues and faeros continues, the hydrogues offer the Ildirans peace if they help destroy the humans. On Earth, Hansa Chairman Basil Wenceslas continues his red-herring war against the Roamer clans. With some of their hidden bases found and destroyed, the wandering Roamers scatter into hiding, trying to keep their culture and government intact, even when faced with enemies from all sides. Speaker Cesca Peroni, leader of the Roamers, finds herself stranded on a small icy outpost where miners have uncovered a hibernating army of Klikiss robots. It soon becomes clear to Cesca that the black robots are anything but benign.\nOf Fire and Night is the fifth book in \"The Saga of Seven Suns\" series by Kevin J. Anderson, published on July 13, 2006. \"Publishers Weekly\" wrote that the \"fabulous fifth volume ... combines glitzy space-opera flash with witty, character-driven action on a cosmic scale,\" and again complimented Anderson's ability to manage multiple plotlines and a large cast of characters.\n\nWith the fate of the Hansa seeming darker than ever, the increasingly desperate and irrational Chairman Basil Wenceslas's punitive treatment of Hansa colonies and free-spirited Roamers, as well as his refusal to aid the burned forest world of Theroc, has made enemies all around. Earth’s own Soldier compies have rebelled thanks to secret programming by the Klikiss robots, taking over most of the Earth Defense Force battleships across the Spiral Arm. Pushed into a corner, Ildiran Mage-Imperator Jora'h has reluctantly agreed to assist the hydrogues in exterminating the human race so that the Ildirans will be spared. Ancient verdani thorny tree battleships arrive after a long journey across the universe to aid Theroc, while the Roamers' plan to seed aquatic planets with wentals to rejuvenate the elemental race comes to fruition. The final hydrogue assault on Earth is put in motion, and with the Hansa's loss of military might and allies, the outlook is grim.\nMetal Swarm is the sixth book in \"The Saga of Seven Suns\" series by Kevin J. Anderson, published on December 10, 2007. \"Publishers Weekly\" noted that while the series \"has been compared to some of the genre’s grandest epics with good reason,\" \"Metal Swarm\" itself \"fails to satisfy on its own merits\" and \"much of the action-packed conflict remains relatively predictable.\" The review placed blame on the novel's \"unwieldy cast of characters, tapestry of intertwining subplots and eon-spanning backstory.\" Paul Di Filippo of SciFi.com agreed that \"Metal Swarm\" is \"just more of what has come before\" and suggested that the story arc did not really justify such a long series. He commented that by the sixth installment \"one would hope for a kind of summing-up or accelerando or intensification of pitch\" but felt that \"the initial states of the protagonists remain essentially static.\"\n\nThe hydrogues have been defeated across the galaxy thanks to the combined efforts of the Earth Defense Forces, the Ildiran Empire, the Roamer clans, the wentals and the verdani. But as the various factions try to recover, Hansa Chairman Basil Wenceslas intends to brutally crush any resistance to his rule. King Peter and Queen Estarra, having escaped Earth and Basil's plot to kill them and their unborn child, have fled to Theroc and declared a new Confederation. Peter embraces the Roamer clans, denouncing Basil and assuring that the essential Theron green priests across the galaxy will not aid the Hansa until Basil abdicates. An ever-growing number of colony worlds, already devoted to Peter and tired of their treatment by the Hansa, also declare their independence from Basil's government and ally themselves with Peter. Despite several losses in their bid to seize control of the galaxy, the Klikiss robots continue to attack helpless worlds with stolen Earth battleships. They are stunned to come face to face with their ancient enemies the Klikiss, who have returned after 10,000 years intent on reclaiming their former worlds and willing to annihilate anyone who happens to be in the way. Jora'h's brother Rusa'h, thought killed when his rebellion was crushed, returns as an avatar of the faeros, devouring the souls of planet after planet of Ildirans to rejuvenate the weakened fire elementals and destroy Jora'h.\nThe Ashes of Worlds is the seventh book in \"The Saga of Seven Suns\" series by Kevin J. Anderson, published on July 1, 2008.\n\nAt the end of his rope, Hansa Chairman Basil Wenceslas has alienated all of the other factions in the Spiral Arm in his increasingly myopic and destructive struggle to reconsolidate the power he once held over the human race. With the Ildiran Mage-Imperator his hostage to thwart an Ildiran alliance with King Peter's Confederation, Basil installs a new puppet king of the Hansa: Peter's own brother Rory, thought killed years before. Rusa'h and the faeros have seized control of Ildira and Theroc with much loss of Ildiran and human lives.\nVeiled Alliances is a prequel graphic novel to \"The Saga of Seven Suns\" series by Kevin J. Anderson, published on February 1, 2004. \"Publishers Weekly\" commended its \"superlative art\" but noted that the plot \"feels more like the rushed synopsis of a story than the story itself.\"\n\nA few hundred years before the events of \"Hidden Empire\" (2002), eleven generation ships had been dispatched from an overpopulated Earth to find new planets to colonize. One of the ships, the \"Caillié\", ultimately stumbles upon the Ildirans, an advanced race capable of faster-than-light travel. The Ildirans help the inhabitants of the \"Caillié\" settle the planet Theroc and rescue most of the remaining human ships, then send an envoy to Earth seeking an alliance. Earth is now governed by the wizened King Ben, with Hansa Chairman Malcolm Stannis pulling the strings behind the scenes.\nThe series has received varied reviews. \"Publishers Weekly\" called 2002's \"Hidden Empire\" a \"stellar launch of a new series\" and a \"fascinating future epic\", and praised its \"engaging characters.\" Harriet Klausner of TheBestReviews.com wrote, \"The tale grabs the audience from the start as Kevin J.

The first novel, \"The Dark Between the Stars\", was released by Tor Books on June 3, 2014. The second book in the series, \"Blood of the Cosmos\", was published on June 2, 2015. The third novel, published September 13, 2016, is called \"Eternity's Mind\".\n\n"}

Howard and first published in the September 1933 issue of \"Weird Tales\" magazine. \"The Slithering Shadow\" is the original title, but the story is also known as \"Xuthal of the Dusk\" in further publications. It's set in the pseudo-historical Hyborian Age, and concerns Conan discovering a lost city in a remote desert while encountering a Lovecraftian demon known as Thog.\n\nThe story was republished in the collections \"The Sword of Conan\" (Gnome Press, 1952) and \"Conan the Adventurer\" (Lancer Books, 1966). It has more recently been published in the collections \"The Conan Chronicles Volume 1: The People of the Black Circle\" (Gollancz, 2000) as \"The Slithering Shadow\" and in \"\" (Wandering Star, 2002) and \"The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian\" (Del Rey, 2003) as \"Xuthal of the Dusk.\"\n\nConan and his ally, Natala the Brythunian, are the sole survivors of Prince Almuric's army which swept through the Lands of Shem and the wilderness of Stygia. With a Stygian host on their heels, Almuric's soldiers had cut their way across the kingdom of Kush, only to be annihilated near the edge of Stygia's southern desert.\n\nIn the resulting conflict, when the Stygians and Kushites surrounded the trapped remnants, Conan sliced his way through the Stygian militia and fled on a camel, with Natala, into the southern desert. For days, the two pushed on, seeking water, until their camel died. Then, they continued on foot.\n\nWhen their canteen is empty, Conan prepares to slay Natala in an act of mercy-killing. However, Natala spies the distant city of Xuthal. Eventually, Conan and Natala enter Xuthal while pursued by an entrance guard. They soon encounter Thalis, a beautiful Stygian mage, who reveals the history of her fabled city and the existence of Thog.\n\nThog is a monstrous demon from the city-states of ancient Valusia, his current form summoned by the sorcerers of Xuthal from the darkness between the stars. For an ageless time, Thog has haunted the depths of Xuthal in search of living flesh to assuage the continuing manifestation of his body on the physical plane.\n\nThalis falls in love with Conan and, to eliminate her rival, kidnaps Natala in the hopes of sacrificing her to Thog. However, Thalis pauses to strip Natala of her tunic and, with a jewel-handled whip, flagellates the Brythunian. In the middle of this bizarre act, Thog suddenly appears, snatches Thalis, and devours her. The demon returns for Natala, but Conan intervenes and saves her. Conan fights Thog with all his might, but is scarcely harming the demon's supernatural form, while receiving a hideous wound in the coils of its pseudopods and tentacles. However, Conan manages to pierce what he perceives as the \"head\" of the monster from below and precipitates it down a well. Soon, Thalis is rescued from Thog's stomach and secretly escapes while Conan tosses its head into the well. Conan frees Natala, who sets forth to help him, but he's rapidly dying (this is the closest Conan ever gets to death in all of his saga). Fortunately, the Brythunian girl soon brings him a jade goblet full of golden wine, retrieved from a room with a dreaming woman of Xuthal in it. The beverage proves to be a life-giving elixir briefly mentioned by Thalis in a previous conversation, which miraculously heals all of Conan's wounds. Finally, the couple retrieve enough food and water to cross the rest of the desert with. The two depart toward the horizon while Natala jokingly blames Conan for having aroused Thalis' lustful nature and him retorting playfully about women's jealousy.\nFritz Leiber rated it among the worst of the Conan stories, \"repetitious and childish, a self-vitiating brew of pseudo-science, stage illusions, and the 'genuine' supernatural.\"\n\nThe story was adapted by Roy Thomas, John Buscema and Alfredo Alcala in \"Savage Sword of Conan\" #20, then by Fred Van Lente and Guiu Vilanova in \"Conan the Avenger\" #13-15 (2015).\n\n"}

He was a member of the American Philosophical Society. Before moving to London, he was Alderman and Mayor of Newark-upon-Trent, 1827–1830. In 1850, he published a lively book recounting his life and travels in British North America, \"The Shoe and Canoe\". In 1868, he published his most important scientific work, \"Thesaurus Siluricus\", being a list of all the fossils which occur in the Silurian formation across the world. He contributed about twenty seven papers to various scientific societies in London. He published \"Thesaurus Devonico-Carboniferus\" but died shortly before completing \"Thesaurus Permianus\". In 1874, he was awarded the Murchison Medal. In 1876, he endowed the Bigsby Medal.\n\nBorn 1792 at Nottingham, he was the eldest son of John Bigsby (1760–1844) M.D., F.R.C.P., of Clareborough Cottage, East Retford, Nottinghamshire, and Mary (d.1821), only daughter of John Chamberlin (d.1815), J.P., of Red Hill, High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire. His brother, Thomas, lived at Retford and married a daughter of Colonel John Kirke (1777–1826), J.P., of Markham Hall and Retford. His second brother, Charles, graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge, and became a clergyman. Bigsby Road in Retford is named for his family.\n\nLike his father, John Jerimiah Bigsby was educated at Edinburgh University where he took the degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1814. That year he published his thesis and became a physician at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. In 1816, he joined the British Army as an assistant surgeon and was stationed at the Cape of Good Hope in 1817. The following year, he was appointed medical officer to a German Rifle Regiment in the English service and posted with them to British North America. He was stationed at Quebec City but was sent to Hawkesbury in Upper Canada to treat a typhus epidemic among Irish immigrants.\n\nHe developed a great interest in geology and was commissioned in 1819 to report on the geology of Upper Canada. He was the first person to investigate and describe the Oak Ridges Moraine.\n\nIn 1822 he was appointed British secretary and medical officer to the Boundary Commission, and for several years he made extensive and important geological researches, contributing papers to the \"American Journal of Science\" and other scientific journals; and later embodying an account of his travels in a book entitled \"The Shoe and Canoe\" (1850).\n\nReturning to England in 1827 he practised medicine at Newark-on-Trent until 1846 when he removed to London, where he remained until the end of his life. He now took an active interest in the Geological Society of London, of which he had been elected a fellow in 1823. In 1869 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1874 he was awarded the Murchison Medal by the council of the Geological Society of London. During the last twenty years of his long life he was continually at work preparing, after the most painstaking research, tabulated lists of the fossils of the Palaeozoic rocks. His \"Thesaurus Siluricus\" was published with the aid of the Royal Society in 1868; and the \"Thesaurus Devonico-Carboniferus\" ln 1878.

He is also known by the formal title of authority \"Toison d'or\" (Golden Fleece) because he served as the King of Arms to the Order of the Golden Fleece.\n\nOf noble birth, he adopted the profession of arms and with other Burgundians fought in the English ranks at the Battle of Agincourt. Following the foundation of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1430 by Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, at the Order's chapter meeting in Lille (November 1431) Le Fèvre was appointed its king of arms and he soon became a very influential person at the Burgundian court. As counsellor to the duke of Burgundy, he frequently assisted Philip III in conducting negotiations with foreign powers, and he was an arbiter in tournaments and authority on all questions of chivalry, where his wide expert knowledge of heraldry was highly respected. Recognition of distinction for his services in the form \"adoubement\" and \"knighthood\" ensued late in Le Fèvre's life: the medieval chronicler Georges Chastellain describes a moving scene at the occasion of the Order's chapter meeting in Bruges in May 1468, where the King of Arms Le Fèvre retired from service on the grounds of old age. Shortly after the Order's tribute in his honour, Le Fèvre died at Bruges of natural causes on 16 June 1468.\n\nLe Fèvre also wrote a chronicle or history of Charles VI of France. The greater part of this chronicle is a resumption of the work of Enguerrand de Monstrelet, but Le Fèvre is an original authority for the years between 1428 and 1436 and makes some valuable additions to our knowledge, especially about the chivalry of the Burgundian court. He is more concise than Monstrelet, but is equally partial to the dukes of Burgundy. The chronicle has been edited by F. Morand for the Société de l'histoire de France (Paris, 1876): \"Chronique de Jean le Fèvre Seigneur de Saint Rémy\". Le Fèvre is usually regarded as the author of \"Livre des Faits de Jacques Lalaing\", a chronicle biography on the events of the Burgundian knight Jacques de Lalaing.\n"}

They rise from the central plain of Ireland to a height of 527 metres. While not very high, they are extensive by local standards. The highest points are Arderin (527 m) () at the southwestern end of the range and Baunreaghcong (511 m) at the end of the Ridge of Capard.\n\nThe Slieve Bloom Mountains stretch from near Roscrea in the south west to Rosenallis in the north west forming a link between County Laois and County Offaly. Access to the mountains and the most popular attractions is easiest by taking Exit 18 off the M7 for Mountmellick and following the R422 for Rosenallis, Clonaslee, Cadamstown, and Kinnitty. There are 3 routes which cross the mountain. From Clonaslee here it is very easy to follow the mountain road over 'the Cut' towards Mountrath. From Kinnitty take the road from the centre of the village opposite the Catholic Church past Longford Church to Glendine Gap near Ard Erin the highest point in the mountain. For some splendid views turn left onto the R440 towards Kinnitty one of the small villages nestled at the foot of the mountains.\n\nLooped walking trails have been developed at 6 trail heads in the Slieve Blooms, Glenbarrow, Clonaslee, Cadamstown, Kinnitty, Glenafelly Forest Car Park and Glen Monicknew. Walking trails are colour-coded green easy, blue moderate, and red most difficult. The 84 km Slieve Bloom Way colour-coded yellow can be accessed from any of these trailheads. In Cadamstown take time to walk the Silver River Eco Trail.\n\nGlenbarrow Falls are located just a few miles from Rosenallis. Some scenic looped walks will take you to the falls and up onto the Ridge of Capard. There is a significant population of red grouse in the hills.\n\nThe Slieve Bloom, along with the Massif Central in France, are one of the oldest mountain ranges in Europe; they were once also the highest at 3,700m. Weathering has reduced them to 527m. On a clear day, one can see the high points of the four ancient provinces of Ireland.\n\nAccording to the Bodleian Dinnshenchas, here are two theories of how the mountains were given their name:\n[11. SLIAB BLADMA.] Bladma or Blod, son of Cú, son of Cass Clothmín, killed the cowherd of Bregmael, the smith of Cuirche, son of Snithe, King of Húi Fuatta. Then he went in his little boat till he set up at Ross Bladma — Ross n-Áir, “Wood of Slaughter,” was its name at first. Thence he went to the mountain. Hence is “Sliab Bladma” (Bladma’s Mountain). Whence the poet said: ‘Blod, son of Cú, son of Cass Clothmín, Killed the cowherd of fair Bregmael, The smith of Cuirche Mór, son of Snithe: He set up at Ross Tíre ind Áir.’ Or it is Blod, son of Breogan, that died there; and from him the mountain of Bladma was named.\nEdward J. Gwynn’s \"The Metrical Dindshenchas\" give a longer account and another origin story (\"bleda mara\" \"sea-monsters\" cf. Modern Irish \"bleidhmhíol\" \"monster; whale\"):\nSliab Bladma\nBlod, son of Cu, son of Cass the renowned, son of Uachall the many-shaped, killed Bregmael the famous smith of Cuirche, son of Snithe the swimmer.\nCurche Cendmar was a daring king over Medraige and over Herot; through him Blod, son of Cass Clothmin, found never sure protection. He fared in his ship–clear purpose from the Bottom of pure-cold Galway, from Ath Cliath in wide Herot to Ath Cliath in Cualu. Thence he came after many a turn to the Point of Nar, son of Edliuc,and possessed, as his special portion, the mountain whose name derives from Blod. A valiant man who used to wage battle died at Sliab Bladma–vast renown even Blad, son of Bregon, with troops of warriors, died of disease in the monster-haunted Sliab Blod.\n\nOr, it is from the son of Bregon the wrathful that it is named Sliab Bladma, with onsets of women their increase is not far from the cattle was the mountain where it happened through strong Blad.\n\nOr the monsters of the sea that was not calm, beasts–ruisenda was their name–came throughout the land of the tribes, so that from them is named Sliab Bled. Blod, son of Cu, son of Cass Clothmin, slew the herd of Bregmael the smith of Curche, son of Snithe, he settled at Ross Tire Nair.\n</li>\n</ol>\nThe Modern Irish meaning of \"bladhm\" is \"flame; flare up\", \"bladhma\" being the genitive case.\n\nThe mountains formed the northern border of the kingdom of Osraige, and later Upper Ossory.\n\nFionn Mac Cumhaill was brought up in Sliabh Bladhma by his aunts, his mother's sisters the poets Bovmall and Lia Luachra, so that he would be safe from Clann Morna, who had killed his father.\n\nThe following table lists the 10 highest major mountain peaks of the Slieve Bloom Mountains, all with a topographic elevation of at least 406 metres (1,332 ft).\n"}

It was released by United Artists and is a sequel to the film \"Mandingo\", released in 1975. The film stars Warren Oates, Pam Grier, Ken Norton, and was directed by Steve Carver.\n\nThis film picks up the story 15 years after the events of the first film. Drum (Norton) has been born to a white prostitute (Vega), who raises him with her black lesbian lover (Kelly). Drum grows up to be a fighter and is often forced to bare-knuckle-box other slaves for the entertainment of the owners, one of whom is a gay Frenchman named Bernard DeMarigny (Colicos). DeMarigny wants to sleep with Drum, but his advances are rejected by the slave and DeMarigny vows revenge against Drum. Drum and his friend Blaise (Kotto) are eventually sold to plantation owner Hammond Maxwell (Oates) and are both taken to his plantation to work. Regine (Grier) is purchased by Maxwell as well and is taken to the plantation for his own personal desires as a bedwench.\n\nAfter arriving at Maxwell's plantation, Regine is set up in the bedroom above Hammond. Augusta Chauvel (Lewis), Maxwell's fiancé is jealous and has other plans for Regine. Maxwell's daughter Sophie (Smith) wants to sleep with Drum, but he won't for fear of being killed. Sophie also attempts to sleep with Blaise and after being rejected, tells her father that Blaise has raped her, which is a lie. Blaise is put in chains and Maxwell decides that he must be castrated for the alleged rape.\n\nMeanwhile, a dinner party has been arranged to celebrate the engagement of Maxwell and Chauvel. DeMarigny has been invited to attend the celebration and the guests end up discussing the best way to castrate a slave at the dinner party. While the party is taking place, Drum frees Blaise from his chains and there ends up being a violent uprising from the slaves at the engagement party. DeMarigny shoots Blaise during the fighting and Drum in turn grabs hold of DeMarigny's privates and rips them off. Both slaves and slavers are killed during the battle, but Maxwell and Chauvel are all saved by Drum. In appreciation for saving his family, Maxwell sets Drum free and sends him running into the night, which is the final scene of the movie, Drum running away into the unknown.\n\nThe film was initially being directed by Burt Kennedy, but he was replaced due to creative differences with the executive producer, Dino De Laurentiis. Carver then took over as director with only four days of preparation, the film's print made use of material filmed by both Kennedy and Carver.\n\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" wrote: \"Life on the old plantation was horrendous, I agree, but movies like this are less interested in information than titillation, which, in turn, reflects contemporary obsessions rather more than historical truths.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2266302", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2266302", "title": "Huo Yuanjia", "text": "Huo Yuanjia\n\nHuo Yuanjia (18 January 1868 – 9 August 1910), courtesy name Junqing, was a Chinese martial artist and a co-founder of the Chin Woo Athletic Association, a martial arts school in Shanghai. A practitioner of the martial art mizongyi, Huo is considered a hero in China for defeating foreign fighters in highly publicised matches at a time when Chinese sovereignty was being eroded by foreign imperialism, concessions and spheres of influence. Due to his heroic status, the legends and myths surrounding events in his life are difficult to discern from facts.\n\nHuo was born in Xiaonanhe Village in Jinghai County, Tianjin, as the fourth of Huo Endi's ten children. The family's main source of income was from agriculture, but Huo Endi also made a living by escorting merchant caravans to Manchuria and back. Although he was from a family of traditional wushu practitioners, Huo was born weak and susceptible to illness. He had asthma and, at an early age, he contracted jaundice, which would recur periodically for the rest of his life. It is theorised that he may have had a mild form of congenital jaundice known as Gilbert's syndrome. Due to his frail frame, his father discouraged him from learning wushu.\n\nHuo Endi hired Chen Seng-ho, a tutor from Japan, to teach his son academics and moral values. In return, Chen was taught the Huo family's style of martial arts, mizongyi. Huo still desired to learn wushu, against his father's wishes, so he observed his father teaching his students martial arts in the day and secretly practised at night with Chen.\n\nIn 1890, a martial artist from Henan visited the Huo family and fought with Huo's elder brother, who lost. To the surprise of his family, Huo fought with his brother's opponent and defeated the latter. As Huo proved that he was physically able to practise wushu, his father accepted him as a student. As he became older, Huo went on to challenge martial artists from neighbouring areas and his fame grew as he defeated more opponents in bouts.\n\nHuo joined his father at work as a caravan guard. One day, while escorting a group of monks, Huo was confronted by a group of bandits, who threatened to attack the monks. Huo fought the bandit chief and defeated him. News of his feat spread and added on to his growing fame. In 1896, Huo went to Tianjin and made a living there by working as a porter in the Huaiqing pharmacy and by selling firewood.\n\nIn 1902, Huo responded to a challenge advertised by a Russian wrestler in Xiyuan Park, Tianjin. The wrestler openly called the Chinese \"sick men of Asia\" because no one accepted his challenge to a fight. The Russian forfeited when Huo accepted his challenge and told Huo that he was merely putting on a performance to make a living and apologised for his earlier remark in the newspaper.\n\nBetween 1909 and 1910, Huo travelled to Shanghai twice to accept an open challenge posed by an Irish boxer, Hercules O'Brien. The two of them had arguments over the rules governing such boxing matches and eventually agreed that whoever knocked down his opponent would be the victor. O'Brien fought Huo and lost. Huo's victory was a great inspiration to the Chinese people and had them questioning the basis of imperialistic dominance. However, there is a lot of controversy over whether the fight ever took place. A recent article states that O'Brien opted to leave town instead.\n\nBetween 1909 and 1910, Huo founded the Chin Woo Physical Training Centre (精武体操会) (later renamed to \"Chin Woo Athletic Association\") with his close friend Nong Jinsun, who served as the president of the association. Huo was encouraged by his close friends and was sponsored by Sun Yat-sen and Song Jiaoren, who were living in Tokyo. The centre was meant to be a school for learning the arts of self-defence and improvement of health and mind.\n\nHuo suffered from jaundice and tuberculosis and started seeing a Japanese physician for medication and treatment. The physician, who was a member of the Japanese Judo Association in Shanghai, invited Huo to a competition upon hearing of the latter's fame. Huo's student, Liu Zhensheng, competed with a judo practitioner. Although there were disputes over who won the match, both sides generally agreed that the disagreement culminated in a brawl and that members of the judo team were injured, some with broken fingers and hands, including the head instructor.\n\nHuo died in 1910 at the age of 42. He was survived by his wife Ms. Wang (王氏; given name unknown) (1869?–1960), two sons Huo Dongzhang (霍東章) and Huo Dongge (霍東閣), and three daughters Huo Dongru (霍東茹), Huo Dongling (霍東玲) and Huo Dongqin (霍東琴).\n\nThe historian Chen Gongzhe, who was also one of Huo's students, believed that the cause of his master's death was hemoptysis disease. Chen wrote that Huo was introduced to a Japanese physician by the judo instructor as his health declined. The physician prescribed some medicine for his condition, but Huo's health continued to deteriorate. Huo was admitted to the Shanghai Red Cross Hospital, where he died two weeks later. Although Chen did not mention that the medicine prescribed by the Japanese physician contained arsenic or any other poison, some leaders of the Chin Woo Athletic Association speculated that Huo was poisoned around the time of his death.\n\nIn 1989, Huo's and his wife's graves were excavated and their remains were relocated elsewhere. Black spots were discovered in Huo's pelvic bones. The Tianjin Municipality Police Laboratory confirmed that they contained arsenic. However, it is difficult to ascertain whether Huo's death was caused by malicious poisoning or by the prescription of medicine. This was because arsenic trioxide has been used therapeutically for approximately 2,400 years as part of traditional Chinese medicine.\n\nHuo died months after co-founding the Chin Woo Athletic Association. Before his death, he invited Zhao Lianhe of the Shaolin Mizong Style to teach in Chin Woo and Zhao agreed. Subsequently, a number of other martial arts masters agreed to teach at the school. They included Eagle Claw master Chen Zizheng, Seven Star Praying Mantis master Luo Guangyu, Xingyiquan master Geng Xiaguang, and Wu Jianquan, the founder of Wu-style taijiquan. In June 1910, the \"Eastern Times\" announced the establishment of the Chin Woo association in Huo's name. It was the first civil martial arts organisation in China that was not associated with a particular school or style.\n\nHuo's life has been adapted into films and television series. In these adaptations, Huo is typically depicted as a heroic martial artist who fights to uphold the dignity of the Chinese people in the face of foreign aggression. He is secretly poisoned to death by foreigners, usually the Japanese, who see him as a threat to their exploitation of China. A notable feature in some of these adaptations is the appearance of Chen Zhen, a fictional character first portrayed by Bruce Lee in the 1972 film \"Fist of Fury\". In the film, Chen Zhen is one of Huo's apprentices. He brings his teacher's murderers to justice and ensures that Huo's legacy, the Jingwu School and \"Jingwu Spirit\", continues to live on. Notable actors who have portrayed Huo on screen include: Wong Yuen-sun, in \"The Legendary Fok\" (1981); Bryan Leung, in \"Legend of a Fighter\" (1982); Eddy Ko, in \"Fist of Fury\" (1995); Vincent Zhao, in \"Huo Yuanjia\" (2001); Jet Li, in \"Fearless\" (2006); Ekin Cheng, in \"Huo Yuanjia\" (2008).\n\n\n"}

It has more recently been published in the collections \"The Conan Chronicles Volume 1: The People of the Black Circle\" (Gollancz, 2000) and \"\" (Del Rey, 2003).\n\nThe story begins when Olivia, having fled from her captivity in the city of Akif, is finally cornered near a marsh on the edge of the Vilayet Sea. Olivia's pursuer and former master is a sadistic rogue named Shah Amurath. Suddenly, before Amurath could lay his hands on Olivia, a figure rises from the reeds. The newcomer has witnessed all his friends betrayed and treachery cut him down to a man, before escaping into the marshes. There, he has hidden out for so long he is nearly mad. The newcomer quickly kills Amurath, as he and Olivia climb aboard a raft while deciding to lie low for a while. Only then, does the stranger identify himself: Conan the Cimmerian.\nThe couple sail towards a dark and apparently deserted island, where they spend the night sleeping near ancient ruins decorated with remarkably lifelike statues. Olivia has a bizarre dream where she witnesses a tribe of men being transformed into the statues by a vengeful god, and is convinced they will come to life in the moonlight. Conan is less than convinced by Olivia's fears; he's more concerned by whatever it is lurking in the jungle, lobbing giant boulders at the two fugitives.\n\nEventually, a pirate ship arrives on the island. Leaving Olivia hidden in the foliage, Conan challenges their captain, an old rival. He slays the pirate captain, but is knocked unconscious by a stone from another pirate's sling. The pirates capture Conan and drag him to the ruins, where they discuss his fate, before passing out drunk. Meanwhile, Olivia narrowly escapes from a dark figure which pursues her close to the ruins.\n\nOlivia sneaks past the drunken pirates and frees Conan. Soon, Conan slays the dark figure pursuing Olivia, a giant ape, which had also been hurling the boulders at them.

As Conan prepares the ship to sail, a band of bruised and bewildered pirates appear while asking for his aid in leaving the \"devil island\". Conan challenges the pirates and they accept him as their new captain.

Inside his subterranean temple, Yimsha agrees on an alliance with Kerim Shah, a mercenary working for King Yezdigerd of Turan, who had arranged for Bunda Chand's assassination so he could conquer Vendhya in the resulting turmoil. However, a man named Khemsa, who was Kerim Shah's contact with the Black Seers, has fallen in love with the devi's maid Gitara. These two abandon their previous agenda, execute the captured hillmen, and pursue Queen Yasmina to kill her as well.\nConan escapes into an Afghuli village near Zhaibar Pass and the Himelian Mountains (Hyborian equivalents of Khyber pass and the Himalayas). Yar Afzal, chief of a Wazuli village, is murdered by Khemsa and the natives accuse Conan of killing him. With Yasmina's aid, he manages to escape. Soon, Khemsa catches up with Conan and Yasmina. However, his attack is interrupted by four rakshasas and their master, Yimsha. The wizard throws his former servant down a cliff, kills Gitara, stuns Conan with an ancient spell, and captures Yasmina. Khemsa survives his fall from the cliffside long enough to give Conan a warning and his magic girdle.\n\nSoon after, Kerim Shah and a tribe of Irakzais (Orakzai Pashtun people), hired by King Yezdigerd to capture Yasmina, encounter Conan. They join forces to rescue Yasmina, both explaining their private reasons for doing so, and approach the lair of Yimsha. Most of the men are killed in their attempt. However, following Khemsa's advice, Conan succeeds in killing the Black Seers and rescuing Yasmina. As they escape, the two encounter the Turanian army in battle with Conan's tribe of hillmen, who blame him for the death of their captive fellows. Despite their attitude, Conan feels obliged to assist his tribe - but he is also loath to abandon the Devi. His problem is resolved when a Vendhyan army, invading the mountains to rescue their queen, arrives. Together, Conan with his Afghulis and Yasmina with her cavalry, they defeat the Turanian army. Conan leaves with the hillmen and Yasmina returns to her country.\n\nThough they are strongly attracted to each other, the affair between Conan and Yasmina never gets beyond some kissing. Their respective roles pull them in opposite directions - she is Queen of Vendhiya, he's leader of nomadic hillmen engaged in constant robbery against Yasmina's domain. In the original Howard stories, they never meet again. In the 1957 novel \"Return of Conan\", Björn Nyberg and L. Sprague de Camp allow the two rivals in encountering each other again for one night of intensive love-making, many years later - when he is already King of Aquilonia and there is no more a conflict of interest.\n\nEverett F. Bleiler noted the story's \"Much spectacular magic and interesting characters.\" Fritz Leiber praised the story lavishly, comparing it to \"the melodramas of Marlowe\" and declaring \"It has stirring language, strong motives, awesome sorcerers, brilliant magical devices, sympathetic hero-villains, and a Conan subdued enough to make the outcome interesting.\"\n\nThe story was republished in the collections \"The Sword of Conan\" (Gnome Press, 1952) and \"Conan the Adventurer\" (Lancer Books, 1966). It was first published by itself in book form by Donald M. Grant, Publisher, Inc. in 1974. It has most recently been republished in the collections \"The Conan Chronicles Volume 1: The People of the Black Circle\" (Gollancz, 2000) and \"\" (Del Rey, 2005).\n\nThe story was adapted by Roy Thomas, John Buscema and Alfredo Alcala in \"Savage Sword of Conan\" #16-19 (Reprinted in 2008 by Dark Horse Comics in Savage Sword of Conan, Volume Two – ).\n\n"}

The ensemble playing in the genre of Crossover was created in 1986. Since that time, Terem Quartet has released 17 CDs, and its repertoire includes more than 500 musical compositions of classical and modern music.\n\nTerem Quartet has performed more than 2,500 concerts in more than 60 countries. The ensemble is regarded as a symbol of Saint Petersburg because it has represented its native city in many cultural events all over the world.\n\nThe recent line-up includes: Andrey Konstantinov (soprano domra), Andrey Smirnov (bayan), Vladimir Kudryavtcev (double bass) and Alexey Barshchev (alto domra)\n\nThe ensemble was created in 1986 as a project of four St. Petersburg Conservatory students: Andrey Konstantinov (soprano domra), Andrey Smirnov (bayan), Mikhail Dzudze (double bass balalaika) and Igor Ponomarenko (alto domra). At one time the students were called up for military service. After the first year of this service they were transferred to the local army ensemble which consisted of orchestra, choir and ballet. Some time later an idea to create a new ensemble was born and this one was called \"Russian Souvenir\". At this time it consisted of a big number of participants and many of them were not able to read musical notes that it why musicians tried to find a special language: they picked out some well-known music pieces and combined them with folk melodies. Then the first line-up of Terem Quartet was formed: Andrey Konstantinov, Andrey Smirnov, Mikhail Dzudze and Igor Ponomarenko.\n\nAt this time we promised each other that just the ensemble will be the main thing for all of us. We have already understood that we are interesting only when we are together. Our \"Terem\" is not just a beautiful building. There are no chiefs for us, everyone does his bit and it forms what we are building. In our music we unite different genres under one roof. Terem is open for guests, we are always glad to see them (Andrey Konstantinov)\n\nThe first concert took place on 26 November 1986 on the stage of music teachers training college. According to Andrey Konstantinov, at the end of the performance the audience stood up and musicians understood that their choice was right. Since that time, November 26 is considered to be the birthday of the ensemble.\n\nIn 1988 Terem Quartet was invited to take part in \"White Nights\" festival in Hamburg. Here musicians performed with Mariinsky Theatre soloist Vladimir Chernov, ballerina Lubov Kunakova and pianist Pavel Egorov. Also in that year director Igor Vladimirov proposed to write music for performance \"Love till Death\" (Lubov do Groba).\n\nIn 1989 Melodiya released the first LP record of the ensemble - \"Terem Quartet\". At this time Terem Quartet began to cooperate with St. Petersburg State Academic Capella. Besides the ensemble began to give performances abroad: in Germany, Spain, Sweden, Italy and People's Republic of China. This year musicians received diplomas of higher education in music.\n\nIn 1991 Terem Quartet was invited to take part in Womad. Within the bounds of this event musicians performed on one stage with Peter Gabriel, Sinéad O'Connor, Suzanne Vega and Led Zeppelin. At Peter Gabriel's instance Real World Records recorded the first CD of the ensemble - \"The Terem\". This Cd was released in 1992. Allmusic Guide gives 4.5 stars to it: \"The Quartet's eccentric approach transforms everything it touches into shades of humor and delight\". In the next years Terem Quartet repeatedly performed on Womad.\n\nIn 1994 Pope John Paul II invited Terem-Quartet to Vatican. Here at the \"Family Day\" holiday they gave concert to 120-thousand audience. Among the listeners was Mother Teresa who blessed the musicians and presented them medallions. This year two cds were released: \"Classical\" and \"1000 concert\" (1000-й концерт). The first one was released by \"Real World Records\" and received its name after Mozart's, Schubert's, Glinka's and Chopin's pieces in it. The second is a recording of the 1000 concert in Saint Petersburg Philharmonia and it was released on Terem-Quartet label.\n\nIn 1998 Terem-Quartet performed on Edinburgh festival and solo concerts of the ensemble received the highest mark of \"Scotsman\" newspaper. This year Terem-Quartet took part in performance of Anton Chekhov's work and this one was awarded the highest theatrical prize \"Golden Soffit\" (Zolotoy Sophit).\n\nIn 1999 within the bounds of Alexander Pushkin 300-anniversary celebration Terem Quartet played Alexander Chaikovsky's opera in St. James's Palace. Among the listeners was Prince Charles. This year two Cds were released: «No, Russia cannot be perceived by wit» (\"Intuition\" Label) produced by Giovanni Amighetti is awarded 4 stars by Allmusic: \"These classically-trained musicians exhibit masterful technique at their tools. The sounds they make seem to arise from an ensemble much greater than a quartet. Subtle, inventive, and gifted with a sense of humor, their gypsy turns thrill and enthrall\". The second - \"Flea Waltz\" (Sobachy Vals) was released by Bomba-Piter and mostly consists of classical compositions adapted by the ensemble.\n\nIn 2000, the line-up underwent changes: Igor Ponomarenko was replaced by Alexey Barshchev. That year, National Geographic Society shot a film about Terem Quartet.\n\nIn 2001, the ensemble celebrated its 15th anniversary. For the occasion, a great Russia tour (50 concerts) and release of \"Jubillenium\" CD were organized.\n\nIn 2002, Bomba-Piter released a three-CD compilation: \"Anthology I\", \"Anthology II\" and \"Anthology III\". Besides the \"Russian Sufferings\" album was released.\n\nIn 2003, Terem Quartet organized its own world music festival in St. Petersburg. It comprised five concerts: Dora Shwarzberg (Austria), Sexteto Canyengue (Netherlands), Boris Berezovsky, Martin Frost (Sweden) and Ural Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Dmitry Liss. The next year, the second festival was set up. That one comprised four concerts: Vladimir Chernov, Sexteto Canyengue, The Real Group (Sweden), Richard Galliano and Michelle Portal (France). The third festival took place in 2005 and comprised three concerts among which, one was of Swingle Singers.\n\nIn 2004 three CDs were released: \"Terem Quartet and Friends\" (featuring Remake ensemble, Vladimir Chernov, Joji Hirota, Svetlana Kruchkova, Dora Shwarzberg, Igor Sharapov, Arkady Shilkloper and Igor Dmitriev), \"2000-th concert\" (recording of the concert in Saint Petersburg Philharmonia on 25 March 2004) and \"Neapolitan Songs\" (joint project with Vladimir Chernov).\n\nIn 2006 Terem Quartet was invited to take part in several political events: Russia-Singapore Forum in Singapore and G8 summit in Saint Petersburg. On 28 June Terem Quartet for the first time performed with ballet and, in the period 24–27 November, the fourth world music festival was organized. During its long life, the ensemble traveled a lot and in October 2007 the concert in the 60th country (South Korea) was performed.\n\nOn 5 April 2008 Terem Quartet organized a forum in which musicians all over the world represented their native countries: Great Britain (Swingle Singers), France (Bratch), Scotland (Shooglenifty), Sweden (Real Group), Iceland (Diddú), Japan (Joji Hirota) and Russia (Yuri Shevchuk, Igor Butman and Pelageya Khanova). Also this year the «Diddu og Terem» was released. All vocal parts were recorded by Diddú.\n\nIn 2009, Terem Quartet opened the Eurovision second semi-final in Moscow. For this event, musicians prepared 6-minute potpourri of songs-winners of this competition (\"Waterloo\" by ABBA, \"Volare\", \"Diva\" by Dana International, \"Believe\" by Dima Bilan and Ding-A-Dong by Teach-In). This year the DVD \"Terem Quartet or Imperceptibles\" (Terem-Quartet Y Snova Neulovimiye) was released. It comprises compositions from popular Soviet movies, Charlie Chaplin's ones and Mission: Impossible Theme.\n\nIn 2010, with the assistance of Saint Petersburg government and Ministry of Culture, Terem Quartet organized First TEREM CROSSOVER International Music Competition in St. Petersburg.\n\nIn 1991 Peter Gabriel called the ensemble style \"Teremism\" by analogy with \"communism\". In European terminology Terem-Quartet's style is known as \"World music\".\n\nIn the \"Creative Infantry\" (Tvorchesky Desant) programme the musicians themselves spoke about their style: the instruments they play give wit to any genre that is why the ensemble turned to classical music, to jazz and to folk-rock but the basis lies in Russian culture, national customs and Russian original world-view. Meanwhile, Andrey Konstantinov added that they take all the best from both western and eastern cultures.\n\nThe name of the ensemble resembles this attitude: \"Terem\" is a big house which unites musical currents all over the world.\n\nTerem is not only a house. It is a place where everything is fine. When creating the ensemble if we had set our goal to make money we wouldn't have become Terem. We always have had a sublime goal - to create contemporary music on the basis of national one so that it was clear and public. So that it excited us and the audience (Andrey Konstantinov).\n\nSometimes musicians called their style \"Terem\" but then the appropriate word was found - \"crossover\". Andrey Konstantinov explained that this genre implies the combination of different styles in order to express music content in a more interesting way.\n\nTerem Quartet was invited to various festivals, it participated in jazz, classical, rock and even punk ones.\n\nThe Quartet's immaculate musicianship shines like an illuminated manuscript...(Independent)\n\nMozart, Chopin and Bizet as you've never heard them before - classical music become theatre. (The Scotsman)\n\nLove, hatred, irony, more philosophical feelings, all of these are mixed in Russian music, it's very spiritual. (Independent)\n\nNikita Mikhalkov said that it was important for him to find a wonderful combination of professionalism, musicality, mischief and root structure in the ensemble.\n\nYuri Shevchuk after the joint performance with the ensemble said that his band DDT and Terem Quartet will be friends. For 20-anniversary he presented the notes of his songs in a hope that Terem Quartet sometime will perform one of them. Terem Quartet took part in recording of 3 songs form DDT's \"Beautiful Love\" (Prekrasnaya Lubov) album.\n\nCurrent line-up includes 4 members:\n\nSince 2003 Terem-Quartet organizes world music festivals in Saint Petersburg. In 2010 the ensemble set up \"Terem Crossover First International Music Competition\" which took place from 22 to 28 March. 71 ensembles participated and the jury was formed from famous people: Terem-Quartet musicians, founder of \"Real World Records\" Thomas Brooman, saxophonist Igor Butman, clarnettist Giora Feidman, accordionist Yasuhiro Kobayashi, pianist Andrey Kondakov, composer Hughes de Courson, Leszek Lukas Barwinski (Universal Music), composer Dmitri Yanov-Yanovsky and Yorrick Benoist (Run Production). During the competition workshops and concerts of the jury were held. Award ceremony and gala-concert took place on 28 March in Saint Petersburg Philharmonia.\n\nTerem-Quartet participates in charities, giving concerts for benefit of cultural funds which are in charge of Russian art revival.\n\nTerem-Quartet organizes competition for gifted children \"TeremOK\". In 2007 about 1000 children participated in it. After that \"TeremOK\" album with songs in Russian and German was released. The winners were lucky to sing to the accompaniment of Terem-Quartet during the concert in Saint Petersburg State Academic Capella.\n\nIn 2010 Terem-Quartet took part in Long Night of Museums. The excursions showing musician's costumes, rarity photos, posters, awards, prizes and presents were held in ensemble art-center. One of this excursions was held by Andrey Konstantinov.\n\nTerem-Quartet regularly records ensembles in its own studio in Saint Petersburg.\n"}

He distinguished himself as professor of mathematical and mechanical philosophy in the college of Ragusa; but after residing there for several years he returned to his native city, where he became a professor in the Collegio Nazareno, and began to form the fine mineralogical collection in that institution.\n\nHis leisure was dedicated to geological researches in the papal states. His account of the aluminous district of Tolfa and adjacent hills, published in 1786, gained for him the notice of the king of Naples, who invited him to inspect the, mines and similar works in that kingdom, and appointed him professor of mineralogy to the royal artillery.\n\nThe vast works for the refining of sulfur in the volcanic district of Solfatara were erected under his direction. He afterwards made many journeys through the ancient Campania to illustrate its geology, and published in 1798 his \"Topografia fisica della Campania\", which contains the results of much accurate observation. Breislak was a pioneer in the collection and analysis of volcanic gas. Breislak also published an essay on the physical condition of the seven hills of Rome, which he regarded as the remains of a local volcano, an opinion shown to be erroneous by the later researches of G. B. Brocchi.\n\nThe political convulsions of Italy in 1799 brought Breislak to Paris, where he remained until 1802, when, being appointed inspector of the saltpetre and powder manufactories near Milan, he removed to that city. The mineral Breislakite was named after him. He died on 15 February 1826.

Howard, one of his original short stories about Conan the Cimmerian, however not published during his lifetime. The story was first published in \"The Magazine of Horror\" for Spring, 1967, and republished in the collection \"Conan of Cimmeria\" (Lancer Books, 1967). It has most recently been republished in the collections \"The Conan Chronicles Volume 1: The People of the Black Circle\" (Gollancz, 2000) and \"\" (Del Rey, 2003). It's set in the pseudo-historical Hyborian Age and details Conan rescuing a female Ophirean captive from the Bakalah tribe, on the (apparent) condition that he will receive sexual favors in return for his generosity.\n\nThe story begins with Livia, a soft and civilized woman, being held captive by the Bakalah tribe. They captured Livia and her brother, when the two were traveling across a remote jungle. Eventually, the natives kill Livia's brother in an act of excruciating torture. Conan appears as the leader of the Bamulas, a rival tribe. He negotiates a possible truce with the Bakalah, and plans for a joint attack on Jihiji. After realizing Conan is white and may feel some kinship towards her, Livia asks him for his assistance against the black tribesmen. When Conan rejects her proposal, Livia offers herself to him as a reward for rescuing her. \n\nKeeping his side of the bargain, Conan and his warriors proceed with a surprise attack on the Bakalahs in the middle of their celebratory feast. Soon, he slays their brutal chief by slicing his head off. The resulting carnage pushes the proper and civilized girl to her breaking point. When Livia sees Conan, drenched in blood and walking toward her bamboo hut while carrying the chief's head, she believes he is coming to claim his reward. Frightened, she breaks their agreement by fleeing on horseback into the nearby jungle.\n\nAfter escaping from the village, her horse stumbles and Livia is thrown onto the ground. Unharmed, she descends into a mysterious valley filled with beautiful orchids. The valley is also inhabited by a tribe of brown-skinned women with a lesbian culture. Believing she has found shelter from the blood-soaked \"male brutality\" of her Cimmerian savior, Livia feels safe around the eerie beauty of her surroundings. Mesmerized by the hallucinogenic scent of a native flower, Livia barely notices she's being led to an altar-like section of the glade, where she is to be sacrificed to a bat-like entity, a devil from the Outer Dark. \n\nConan, having pursued Livia and heard her cries for help, rushes to her aid. After a brutal fight, Conan drives away the bat-like creature. Conan tells Livia that he regrets the \"foul bargain\" he made with her and has no intention of forcing her into having sex, which in his view would have been as damnable an action as raping her. Since he believes Livia is not brave enough to survive within the Black Kingdoms, Conan tells her he'll guide her to the Stygian borders where they will send her home to Ophir. Embarrassed by her grateful reaction, he tells Livia she's too soft to be \"the proper woman for the war chief of the Bamulas\".\n\nJames Van Hise, reviewing \"The Vale of Lost Women\", stated \"\"The Vale of Lost Women\" is a minor effort\", and added \"it has more the air of a Conan pastiche than it does of Howard's more polished and well thought out tales.\" \nMarvel Comics' 1970s \"Conan the Barbarian\" comic spent a very long time detailing and adding to Conan's adventures on the Black Coast.

Howard, one of his original short stories starring the sword and sorcery hero Conan the Cimmerian. It is set in the pseudo-historical Hyborian Age, and concerns Conan becoming the captain of a pirate vessel while encountering a remote island with a mysterious pool which has the power of transmutation.\n\nFirst published in \"Weird Tales\" in October 1933, the story was republished in the collections \"The Sword of Conan\" (Gnome Press, 1952) and \"Conan the Adventurer\" (Lancer Books, 1966). It has more recently been published in the collections \"The Conan Chronicles Volume 1: The People of the Black Circle\" (2000) and \"\" (Del Rey, 2003).\n\n\"The Pool of the Black One\", which appeared in \"Weird Tales\" magazine a month after \"The Slithering Shadow\", is a pirate-themed adventure story and occurs in the Western Sea of the Hyborian Age. The story begins with Conan adrift at sea, after escaping from a council of pirates in the Barachan Isles. He climbs aboard the \"Wastrel\", a ship belonging to a different pirate order who are bitter rivals of the Barachan ones. After a tense conversation with the captain and his brawl with a Zingaran bully, Conan is begrudgingly accepted as a lowly member of the crew and is allowed to remain on board.\n\nThe vessel sails to a mysterious island, where the captain hopes to find a legendary treasure and, perhaps, much more. All hands go ashore, including the tyrannical captain and his mistress Sancha. The island seems deceptively inviting, as the crewmembers gorge themselves on sweet fruit - which causes them to fall asleep. While on the island, Conan confronts his captain alone in the jungle and slays him in a vicious duel. However, the mysterious kidnapping of Sancha and the disappearance of several crew members convinces Conan to travel deeper into the jungle. Meanwhile, the island is revealed to be inhabited by a tribe of tall black humanoids (not black as in kushite or zembabweian, but rather jet black with strange golden-glowing eyes and clawed hands) who captured the crew, force one of the pirates into performing an ancient ritual (which involves having him dance and cavort wildly to the tune of a bizarre flute-like instrument with the power to \"lay bare the most secret lusts and passions of one's soul\"), and proceed to dunk some of Conan's crewmembers in the eponymous pool, which transformed his men into shrunken figures. Thousands of such figures placed across shelves at the side of the pool indicate that the humanoids have been doing this for countless years, and this accounts for many ships which sailed into the west and never returned.\n\nConan rescues the remaining captives, including Sancha, and rallies them to fight against the black humanoids. After a brutal fight, Conan slays the leader of the black humanoids who, before falling dead, utters an ancient formula (the only words ever spoken by the taciturn beings) which triggers a self-destruct device inside the pool. Its sickly and verdant fluids erupt upwards like a geyser and, seemingly broke free of some mystical yoke, proceeds to chase after the surviving pirates, who all scamper wildly towards the \"Wastrel\". Fortunately, the crew manages to raise anchor and set sail literally seconds before the snake-like mass of fluid could touch their ship's hull.\n\nConan warns his crew about the powers of the greenish fluid, leading the way during their rush for the ship and jumping at the helm as soon as the \"Wastrel\" departs; bloodied by their battle against the Black Ones and shocked by these supernatural events, the surviving crew readily accept Conan as their new leader. Soon, Conan asserts his authority as captain and claims Sancha as his prize. The story concludes with the Cimmerian dreaming of raiding seaports and of the future plunder he will acquire.\n\nClark Ashton Smith, in a letter to H. P. Lovecraft dated October 1933, praised the story. Smith wrote \"Howard has some fine romantic fantasy in \"The Pool of the Black Ones\" \"[sic]\"\".\n\nThe story was adapted by Roy Thomas, John Buscema and Sonny Trinidad in \"Savage Sword of Conan\" #22 & 23 (Sept-Oct. 1977).\n\n"}

This may mean multiple different software licenses or sets of licenses. Prefixes may be used to indicate the number of licenses used, e.g. dual-licensed for software licensed under two different licenses.\n\nWhen software is multi-licensed, recipients can typically choose the terms under which they want to use or distribute the software, but the simple presence of multiple licenses in a software package or library does not necessarily indicate that the recipient can freely choose one or the other. In some cases, especially when the software has multiple origins, \"all\" the accompanied licenses apply at the same time. The applicability of the different licenses has to be individually checked. The distributor may or may not apply a fee to either option. The two usual motivations for multi-licensing are license compatibility and market segregation based business models.\n\nMulti-licensing is commonly done to support free software business models in a commercial environment. In this scenario, one option is a proprietary software license, which allows the possibility of creating proprietary applications derived from it, while the other license is a copyleft free software/open-source license, thus requiring any derived work to be released under the same license. The copyright holder of the software then typically provides the free version of the software at little or no cost, and profits by selling proprietary licenses to commercial operations looking to incorporate the software into their own business. This model can be compared to shareware.\n\nSince in most cases, only the copyright holder can change the licensing terms of a software, multi licensing is mostly used by companies that wholly own the software which they are licensing. Confusion may arise when a person outside the company creates additional source code, using the less restrictive license. Because the company with the official code is not the copyright holder of the additional code, they may not legally include this new work in their more restrictively licensed version. Companies may demand outside developers agree to a contributor license agreement, before accepting their work in the official codebase and source code repositories.\n\nMulti licensing is used by the copyright holders of some free software packages advertising their willingness to distribute using both a copyleft free software license and a non-free software license. The latter license typically offers users the software as proprietary software or offers third parties the source code without copyleft provisions. Copyright holders are exercising the monopoly they're provided under copyright in this scenario, but also use multi licensing to distinguish the rights and freedoms different recipients receive.\n\nSuch licensing allows the holder to offer customizations and early releases, generate other derivative works or grant rights to third parties to redistribute proprietary versions all while offering everyone a free version of the software.

These contributions can be the support of a dedicated user community, word of mouth marketing or modifications that are made available as stipulated by a copyleft license.

The license is only offered as a subscription, named MySQL Enterprise Edition Subscription. The same applies for MySQL Standard Edition (MySQL Standard Edition Subscription) and MySQL Cluster CGE (MySQL Cluster Carrier Grade Edition Subscription).\nThe other editions, such as the MySQL Classic Edition or MySQL Community Edition, are free to use with some restrictions. For instance, the MySQL Community Edition is a freely downloadable version, available under the GPL license and is supported by a community of open source developers.\n\nThe term \"single-vendor commercial open source\" was coined by Dirk Riehle in 2010, and has later been further popularized by other scholars, such as Simon R. B. Berdal.\n\nAccording to Riehle: \n\nIn contrast to traditional open source projects, a Single-vendor commercial open source project \"is controlled by exactly one stakeholder with the purpose of commercially exploiting it\". In this context, the open source community is less engaged in the development of core functionality, as they typically are in conventional (pure) open source projects. As the then CEO Mårten Mikos of MySQL said in an interview:\n\nHence, the community of multi-license software as a rule includes employees of the code-owning firm, as well as strategic partners that have vested interest in the software. As Riehle notes, \"In single-vendor open source, almost all of the core product development work is carried out by the commercial firm, with occasional contributions from the community.\"\n\nAs Berdal notes, the governance of the open source community becomes \"a key business management process\" in this context: \"As such, it needs to be aligned with other business activities. Governance models of dual-licensed OSS editions may therefore display a tendency towards commercial bias. To prevent the community from being provoked or alienated it may therefore seem imperative to balance commercial inclinations against “open” interests.\" This is by no means an easy task. As Berdal demonstrated through a case study of SugarCRM, this commercial open source software (COSS) business model can trigger substantial friction points, which can eventually lead to pure open source forks (table adapted from Berdal, Table 3, page 75):\n\nOnly a few months after these friction points were observed, a new fork of the SugarCRM Community Edition was announced.\n\nA second use of multi-licensing with free software is for license compatibility, allowing code from differently licensed free software projects to be combined, or to provide users the preference to pick a license.\n\nExamples include the source code of Mozilla Application Suite and previously Mozilla Thunderbird and Mozilla Firefox, that have used tri-licensing under the Mozilla Public License (MPL) 1.1, GNU General Public License (GPL) 2.0 or GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) 2.1 before the latter upgraded to GPL-compatible MPL 2.0, making the tri-licensing unnecessary. Other examples are Perl, which is dual-licensed under the GPL or Artistic License, and Ruby, whose license contains explicit GPL dual licensing.\n\nMulti-licensing is also used by distributors of non-free software. Sometimes this is done to proprietary software to segregate a market. By splitting customers into multiple categories such as home users, professional users, and academic users, copyright holders can set different prices for each group. However, among proprietary software companies, it is more common to release a \"home edition\" and a \"professional edition\" of a given product, which differ by the software and software features included, not just the license.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2266367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2266367", "title": "The Frost-Giant's Daughter", "text": "The Frost-Giant's Daughter\n\n\"The Frost-Giant's Daughter\" is one of the original fantasy short stories about Conan the Cimmerian, written by American author Robert E. Howard.\n\nIt's set in the pseudo-historical Hyborian Age and details Conan pursuing a spectral nymph across the frozen tundra of Nordheim. Rejected as a Conan story by \"Weird Tales\" magazine editor Farnsworth Wright, Howard changed the main character's name to \"Amra of Akbitana\" and retitled the piece as \"The Gods of the North\", in which it was published in the March 1934 issue of \"The Fantasy Fan\". It was not published in its original form in Howard's lifetime.\n\n\"The Frost-Giant's Daughter\" is the earliest chronological story by Robert E. Howard in terms of Conan's life. The brief tale is set somewhere in frozen Nordheim, geographically situated north of Conan's homeland, Cimmeria. Conan is depicted by Howard as an young mercenary, traveling among with the golden-haired Aesir in a war party. Shortly before the story begins, a hand-to-hand battle has occurred on an icy plain. Eighty men (\"four score\") have perished in bloody combat, and Conan alone survives the battlefield where Wulfhere's Aesir \"reavers\" faced the Vanir \"wolves\" of Bragi, a Vanir chieftain. Thus, the story opens.\n\nFollowing his fierce battle against the red-haired Vanir, Conan, lying exhausted on a corpse-ridden battlefield, is visited by a beautiful and partially-nude woman identifying herself as \"Atali\". Upon her bodice, she wears a transparent veil: a wisp of gossamer that wasn't spun by human origin. The mere sight of her strange beauty awakens Conan's lust and, when she repeatedly taunts him, he insanely chases Atali for miles across the snow-covered region while attempting to capture her.\n\nMocking him with each step, Atali lures Conan into an ambush. Undaunted by the snare, Conan slays her hulking twin brothers, two Frost Giants, and captures Atali in his arms. However, Atali calls upon her father, Ymir, to save her. Before Conan is able to ravish her, Atali disappears in a stroke of lightning which seemingly transforms the landscape and renders him unconscious.\n\nLater, when his Aesir comrades arrive, Conan believes he simply dreamed the bizarre encounter. Suddenly, Conan realizes he's still gripping onto a translucent veil which served as the sole garment of the Frost-Giant's daughter.\n\nThe utilization of poetic descriptions throughout this tale is quite strong, and on par with Howard's \"Queen of the Black Coast\". However, the narrative is often criticized by Howard scholars for not having the more detailed plotting of his superior Conan stories such as \"The Black Stranger\". Largely, this is because Howard was aiming for a mythological feel, something to which the story is eminently suited.\n\nThis is the only Conan story in which other characters refer to him as \"a southerner\". In all the rest of his wanderings, Conan is invariably \"a barbarian from the cold north\", but for the Aesir and Vanir, Cimmeria is a southern land, a bit less cold than theirs.\n\nWhile Robert E. Howard had already written many fantasy stories featuring northern Viking-like characters, the names and plot structure for \"The Frost-Giant's Daughter\" was derived in its entirety from Thomas Bulfinch's \"The Outline of Mythology\" (1913). Howard combined the legend of Atalanta with another reworked Bulfinch legend, that of Daphne and Apollo, but he reversed the roles. Whereas Apollo was a god and Daphne a mortal, Howard made Atali a goddess and Conan a mortal. In the original, Cupid had struck Apollo with an arrow to excite love for Daphne, but struck her with an arrow to cause her to find love repellent. Howard kept the idea of the love-maddened Apollo (rather a lust-maddened Conan) pursuing the girl until she invokes aid from her divine father.\n\nThe earlier version of the story was published in the collections \"The Coming of Conan\" (Gnome Press, 1953) and \"Conan of Cimmeria\" (Lancer Books, 1969). The last version, as left by Howard before his death, was first published in 1976 by Donald M. Grant in an edition of the Conan story \"Rogues in the House\". This version of the tale has most recently been republished in the collections \"The Conan Chronicles Volume 1: The People of the Black Circle\" (Gollancz, 2000) and \"The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian\" (Del Rey, 2004).\n\nThe story has been adapted into comics:\n\n\nThe story was adapted into the prologue to the unproduced sequel \"King Conan: Crown of Iron\" written by screenwriter/director John Milius. In the screenplay, Conan encounters the Frost-Giant's Daughter and defeats her brothers, as in the original. However, in Milius' adaptation, he is not interrupted by Ymir and impregnates Atali, who then disappears in apparent fear of \"The Ice Worm\". She bears him a son, named Kon, whose parentage takes on much significance over the course of the story.\n\n"}

His date may safely be put in the 6th century AD, for he mentions Aëtius Amidenus, who probably did not write until the end of the 5th or the beginning of the 6th century, and he is himself quoted by Paul of Aegina, who is supposed to have lived in the 7th century; besides which, he is mentioned as a contemporary of Agathias, who set about writing his \"History\" in the beginning of the reign of Justin II, about 565.\n\nAlexander had the advantage of being brought up under his father Stephanus, who was himself a physician, and also under another person, whose name he does not mention, but to whose son Cosmas he dedicates his chief work, which he wrote out of gratitude at his request. He was a man of an extensive practice, of a very long experience, and of great reputation, not only at Rome, but wherever he traveled in Spain, Gaul, and Italy, whence he was called by way of eminence \"Alexander the Physician\". Agathias speaks also with great praise of his four brothers, Anthemius, Dioscorus, Metrodorus, and Olympius, who were all eminent in their several professions. Alexander is not a mere compiler, like Aëtius Amidenus, Oribasius, and others, but is an author of quite a different stamp, and has more the air of an original writer. He wrote his great work in an extreme old age, from the results of his own experience, when he could no longer bear the fatigue of practice. His style in the main was, according to scholars such as John Freind, very good, short, clear, and (to use Alexander's own term) consisting of common expressions that, though not always perfectly elegant, very expressive and intelligible.\n\nGerman scholar Johann Albert Fabricius considered Alexander to have belonged to the sect of the Methodici, but in the opinion of Freind this is not proved sufficiently by the existing text.\n\nPerhaps the most curious art of Alexander's practice appears to be his belief in charms and amulets. For example, his suggestion for treatment of ague: \"Gather olive leaf before sunrise, write on it with common ink (\"ka roi a\"), and hang it round the neck.\" In exorcising gout he says, \"I adjure thee by the great name \" (\"Iao Sabaoth\"), and a little further on, \"I adjure thee with the holy names \" (\"Iao, Sabaoth, Adonai, Eloi\"), from which he would appear to have been either a Jew or a Christian, and, from his frequent prescription of pork, it is most probable that he was a Christian.\n\nAlexander's chief work, titled \"Twelve Books on Medicine\", first appeared in an old, imperfect Latin translation, with the title \"Alexandri Yatros Practica\", which was several times printed. It was first edited in Greek by Jac. Goupylus (Paris 1548, fol.), a beautiful and scarce edition, containing also \"Rhazae de Pestilentia Libellus ex Syrorum Lingua in Graecam Translatus\".\n\nThe other work of Alexander that is still extant is a short treatise, , \"De Lumbricis\", which was first published in Greek and Latin by Hieronymus Mercurialis (Venica 1570, 4to). Alexander seems also to have written several other medical works which are now lost. Alexander also is credited with the discovery that depression (melancholia) can lead to homicidal and suicidal tendencies (dianne, hales R. Depression). He expresses his intention of writing a book on Fractures, and also on Wounds of the Head. A treatise on Urine written by him is alluded to by Joannes Actuarius, and he himself mentions a work of his on Diseases of the Eyes, which was translated into Arabic. The other medical treatise on Pleurisy, which is said to have been also translated into Arabic, was probably only the sixth book of his great work, which is entirely devoted to the consideration of this disease. Two other medical works which are sometimes attributed to Alexander Trallianus (viz. a Collection of Medical and Physical Problems, and a treatise on Fevers) could also be attributed to Alexander of Aphrodisias.\n\n\n"}

Howard, one of his works featuring the sword & sorcery hero Conan the Cimmerian. It was written in the 1930s, but not published in his lifetime. When the original Conan version of his story failed to find a publisher, Howard rewrote \"The Black Stranger\" into a piratical Terence Vulmea story entitled \"Swords of the Red Brotherhood\".\n\nThe original version of the story was later rewritten by L. Sprague de Camp into a different Conan story and published in \"Fantasy Magazine\" in February 1953. It was retitled \"The Treasure of Tranicos\" for book publication later the same year. Its first hardbound publication was in \"King Conan\" by Gnome Press, and its first paperback publication was in \"Conan the Usurper\" published by Lancer Books in 1967. It was republished together with an introduction and two non-fiction pieces on the story and on Howard by de Camp with illustrations by Esteban Maroto as \"The Treasure of Tranicos\" by Ace Books in 1980. \n\nHoward's original version of the story was first published in 1987 in \"Echoes of Valor\" and more recently in the collections \"The Conan Chronicles Volume 2: The Hour of the Dragon\" (Gollancz, 2001) and \"\" (Del Rey Books, 2005).\n\nThe story begins with Conan in the Pictish Wilderness, fleeing native warriors who are now hunting him. To escape his pursuers, Conan ascends a nearby crag of rock. Suddenly, he sees the Picts inexplicably abandon their chase and turn back. Soon, Conan realizes this spot must be considered a forbidden place to the Picts. The hill turns out to hold a treasure cave along with the preserved bodies of a pirate captain, Tranicos, and his men. Conan's attempt to remove the treasure proves futile, as a demon of mist appears and attempts to strangle him. He barely escapes with his life, leaving the treasure undisturbed.\n\nCoinciding with Conan's attempt at looting the treasure is the main plot of a character named Count Valenso Korzetta, a former nobleman from Zingara. Vanlenso has fled his homeland to escape a demon whom he double-crossed, only to end up on the western shores of the Pictish territory. With his entourage are his niece, the Lady Belesa, and her handmaiden, Tina, along with other soldiers and retainers. The Count is stunned when he learns that a buccaneer, Black Zarono, has also landed on the shores, followed by the pirate Strombanni. Both pirates believe Valenso has traveled to this deserted region in search of the legendary Treasure of Tranicos. \n\nThe buccaneers are both bitter enemies and bring their feud towards the Count's stronghold. During a meeting one night between the Count, Black Zarono, and Strombanni, Conan surprisingly emerges from behind some drapery. All eyes are on Conan as he enters the room. The men learn from Conan that he, \"himself\", has discovered the Treasure of Tranicos and would be willing to share the loot with the others, if they help him retrieve it. They reluctantly make a thieves' pact and agree to join Conan, knowing full well that they will kill him once the treasure is in their possession. Conan, on the other hand, has something else in mind for his companions, chiefly trapping them in the treasure vault to have them be killed by the demon, taking the treasure with the crews of both ships, and sailing away. \n\nConan's scheme ultimately fails, and the sailors find themselves trapped by Picts surrounding the rocky crag. The pirates once again declare a truce to combat a common foe. Once the pirates escape the crag, it is a race to the Count's stronghold with the Picts in hot pursuit. The story ends with the defeat of the stronghold by the Picts as well as the deaths of the Count, Strombanni, and Black Zarono. However, Conan himself manages to escape across the fortress wall in the ensuing chaos, carrying both Belesa and Tina with him to safety.\n\nHoward's version of the story pointed toward a new piratical career for Conan; one of de Camp's major changes was to make it lead instead into the revolution that would bring the Cimmerian to the throne of Aquilonia. The Counts of Poitain arrive on the isolated shores, looking for Conan to lead them against the despotic King of Aquilonia, Numedides. Tranicos' treasure would be used to finance the rebel army which would transform Conan from a pirate and mercenary into a king.\n\nThough set in the Hyborian Age, a fictional past around 10,000 BC, the story has many connotations of the American Frontier, about which Howard also wrote some stories. The Picts are thinly-disguised Native Americans--with feathers in their hair, wearing moccasins, and wielding tomahawks. The situation of an isolated outpost behind its palisade, in the midst of a threatening forest, which is full of these hostile Picts is familiar from numerous historical and literary depictions of the frontier. Also, Conan makes several references to his being \"a white man\"--a racial bond uniting him, the \"barbarian\", with the other \"civilized\" protagonists, against their common foe: the Pictish \"savages.\"\n\nAs noted above, when the original Conan version of his story failed to find a publisher, Howard re-wrote \"The Black Stranger\" as \"Swords of the Red Brotherhood\" by placing it in a historical background of 17th century America. In this version, the location is moved to the Pacific shore of Central America, and Conan becomes the Irish pirate Black Terence Vulmea. Howard regarded Conan's Cimmerians as the ancestors of the Irish people and other Celts. The exile Zingaran, Lady Belesa, becomes a French noblewoman named Francoise d'Chastillon, the rival Zingaran and Barachan pirates become respectively French and English, the Picts become Native Americans (which they already resembled in the original), and the Treasure of Tranicos becomes the Treasure of Montesuma. The main differences with the original are a reduction of the supernatural element and that in the ending of this version, Black Vulmea is not offered any throne and is quite content to remain a pirate captain. \n\nIn both the original and this adaptation, the Cimmerian/Irish pirate protagonist is highly chivalrous. He saves the damsel in distress at considerable risk to himself, giving her as a parting gift a fortune in gemstones; big enough to have a comfortable wealthy life in Zingara/France. He asks for no sexual favors in return.\n\nJames Van Hise, reviewing the original Howard version of the story, stated that the \"writing is so good that it draws you into the situations of the supporting characters with surprising ease\" and added that \"\"The Black Stranger\" achieves the powerful epic scope of the best of the Howard Conan epics\". \n\nThe story was adapted by Roy Thomas and John Buscema in \"Savage Sword of Conan\" #47-48.\n\n"}

According to the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security's joint Terrorism Knowledge Base, the Army of God is an active underground terrorist organization in the United States that was formed in 1982. In addition to numerous property crimes, the group has committed acts of kidnapping, attempted murder, and murder. While sharing a common ideology and tactics, the group's members claim that they rarely communicate with each other; this is known more formally as leaderless resistance. The organization forbids those who wish to \"take action against baby killing abortionists\" from discussing their plans with anyone in advance.\n\nThe earliest documented incidence of the Army of God being involved with anti-abortion activity occurred in 1982. Three men stating that they were the \"Army Of God\" kidnapped Hector Zevallos, a doctor who performed abortions, and his wife, Rosalee Jean, and held them hostage. The hostages were later released unharmed after eight days. The \"East Coast division\" of the AOG claimed responsibility when three men, including Michael Bray, planted bombs at seven abortion clinics in Maryland, Virginia, and Washington D.C. in 1985.\n\nIn 1993, Shelly Shannon, a very active member of the Army of God, was found guilty of the attempted murder of Dr. George Tiller and sentenced to eleven years in prison. George Tiller was later assassinated in 2009 by Scott Roeder during a Sunday church service. Roeder admired Shannon greatly and had visited her many times while she was in prison. That same year, law enforcement officials found the \"Army of God Manual\", a tactical guide to arson, chemical attacks, invasions and bombings buried in Shelly Shannon's backyard. Paul Jennings Hill was found guilty of the murder of both Dr. John Britton and clinic escort James Barrett. The AOG claimed responsibility for Eric Robert Rudolph's 1997 nail bombing of abortion clinics in Atlanta and Birmingham as well as an Atlanta lesbian bar. The group is also responsible for sending a death threat via letter to former Supreme Court Justice Henry Blackmun who wrote the majority opinion for Roe v. Wade.\n\nClayton Waagner, claiming to act on the part of the \"Virginia Dare Chapter\" of the AOG, mailed over 500 letters containing white powder to 280 abortion providers in 2001. The letters claimed that the powder was anthrax. Though it was not identified as such, the tactic took advantage of the public's fear of biological warfare after the recent real anthrax attacks. Waagner is a known criminal who utilized a number of aliases to elude police throughout his criminal history. The mailing of the letters suspected to have been filled with anthrax was done after he escaped from Dewitt County Jail in Clinton, Illinois where he was being held prior to sentencing for previously committed crimes.\n\nThe group is also associated with a number of other abortion clinic bombings, arsons and murders of abortion providers. Some of those responsible claimed association with the AOG; in other cases, while the killers expressed no affiliation with the group, the AOG has endorsed their acts and taken up their cause, stating that any action which prevents abortion is justified. Hill was head of a precursor organization called Defensive Action, which issued signed statements to members of Congress in the early 1990s expressing similar sentiments about \"killing the killers\".\n\nAccording to the Global Terrorism Database, the group only ever managed to officially incur one fatality, police officer Robert Sanderson, during their 1998 attack at an abortion clinic in Birmingham, Alabama. However, individual members of the group were known and convicted killers. This includes Paul Hill who not only committed shootings of abortion providers himself but even went so far as to appear on ABC's \"Nightline\" to justify shootings carried out by other anti-abortionists.\n\nThe Army of God Manual is an anonymous document written and widely endorsed by anti-abortionist members of Army of God. According to the Army of God website, the manual \"is not to be construed as sanctioning any group or individual to perform any action.\" \n\nThe book, throughout eight chapters and various appendices, delves into various pillars of their ideology and is essentially a road map on how to commit violence against abortion clinics, abortion providers, and individuals associated with abortion. Parts of the book, specifically the appendices of chapters four, five and six, are not available for public consumption on the group's website due to federal laws. It is now in its third edition and is referred to by the group as a historical document.\n\nThe manual is available in its near entirety on the group's website which was formerly run by Donald Spitz. Spitz has no history of criminal activity but has historically used the website to publish short bios on high profile group members, publish anti-abortion propaganda, post photos of what are claimed to be bloody unborn fetuses that were aborted and uses the website as a means to justify the actions of the group and incite others to support the Army of God and what they stand for.\n\nThe AOG movement, along with select followers, are featured in the HBO documentary film \"Soldiers in the Army of God\" (2000), directed by Marc Levin and Daphne Pinkerson, as part of HBO's America Undercover series.\n\nA 2011 NPR report claimed that an associate of this group, Stephen John Jordi, was imprisoned in a highly restrictive Communication Management Unit.\n\n\n"}

Maintained by the General Services Administration, it is occupied by the Executive Office of the President, including the Office of the Vice President of the United States.\n\nLocated on 17th Street NW, between Pennsylvania Avenue and State Place, and West Executive Drive, the building was commissioned by President Ulysses S. Grant. It was built between 1871 and 1888, on the site of the original 1800 War/State/Navy Building and the White House stables, in the French Second Empire style. While the building exterior received substantial criticism at first, it has since been designated as a National Historic Landmark. It was for years the world's largest office building, with 566 rooms and about ten acres of floor space. Many White House employees have their offices in the EEOB.\n\nIn 1802, the Washington Jockey Club lay at the rear of what is now the site of Decatur House at H Street and Jackson Place, crossing Seventeenth Street and Pennsylvania Avenue to Twentieth Street—today the Eisenhower Executive Office Building—having been completed only four years earlier in 1798, as the stonemasons had finished the brick and painters applied white paint to the President's House.\n\nThe building—originally called the State, War, and Navy Building because it housed the Departments of State, War, and the Navy—was built between 1871 and 1888 in the French Second Empire style.\n\nIt was designed by Alfred B. Mullett, Supervising Architect. Patterned after French Second Empire architecture that clashed sharply with the neoclassical style of the other Federal buildings in the city, it was generally regarded with scorn and disdain, and Mullett, the exterior architect, ended his life by suicide, while in litigation. The OEOB was referred to by Mark Twain as \"the ugliest building in America.\" President Harry S. Truman called it \"the greatest monstrosity in America.\" Historian Henry Adams called it Mullett's “architectural infant asylum.”\n\nMuch of the interior was designed by Richard von Ezdorf using fireproof cast-iron structural and decorative elements, including massive skylights above each of the major stairwells and doorknobs with cast patterns indicating which of the original three occupying departments (State, Navy, or War) occupied a particular space. The total cost to construct the building came in at $10,038,482.42 when construction ended in 1888, after 17 years. The original tenants of the building quickly outgrew it and finally vacated it completely in the late 1930s. The building gradually came to be seen as inefficient and was nearly demolished in 1957. In 1969, the building received the highest recognition possible, becoming a National Historic Landmark.\n\nIn 1981, plans began to restore all the \"secretary of\" suites. The main office of the Secretary of the Navy was restored in 1987 and is now used as the ceremonial office of the Vice President of the United States. Shortly after September 11, 2001, the 17th Street side of the building was vacated and has since been modernized. The building continues to house various agencies that compose the President's Executive Office, such as the Office of the Vice President, the Office of Management and Budget, and the National Security Council. Its most public function is that of the Vice President's Ceremonial Office, which is mainly used for special meetings and press conferences.\n\nMany celebrated national figures have participated in historical events that have taken place within the Old Executive Office Building. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson, Gerald Ford, and George H. W. Bush all had offices in this building before becoming President. It has housed 16 Secretaries of the Navy, 21 Secretaries of War, and 24 Secretaries of State. Sir Winston Churchill once walked its corridors and Japanese emissaries met there with Secretary of State Cordell Hull after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.\n\nPresidents have occupied space in the EEOB as well. Herbert Hoover worked out of the Secretary of the Navy's office for a few months following a fire in the Oval Office on Christmas Eve 1929. President Dwight D. Eisenhower held the first televised Presidential news conference in the building's Indian Treaty Room (Room 474) on January 19, 1955. President Richard Nixon maintained a private \"hideaway\" office in room 180 of the EEOB during his presidency, from where he preferred to work, using the Oval Office only for ceremonial occasions.\n\nVice President Lyndon B. Johnson was the first in a succession of Vice Presidents who have had offices in the building. The first wife of a Vice President to have an office in the building was Marilyn Quayle, wife of Dan Quayle, Vice President to George H.W. Bush.\nThe Old Executive Office Building was renamed the Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Office Building when President Bill Clinton approved legislation changing the name on November 9, 1999. President George W. Bush participated in a rededication ceremony on May 7, 2002.\n\nA small fire on December 19, 2007 damaged an office of the vice-president's staff and included the VP ceremonial office. According to media reporting, the office of the Vice President's Political Director, Amy Whitelaw, was heavily damaged in the fire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Howard pertaining to the Hyborian Age, the fictional setting of his stories about Conan the Cimmerian. It was written in the 1930s but not published during Howard's lifetime. Its purpose was to maintain consistency within his fictional setting.\n\nThe essay sets out in detail the major events of Howard's pseudohistorical prehistory, both period before and after the time of the Conan stories. In describing the cataclysmic end of the Thurian Age, the period described in his Kull stories, Howard links both sequences of stories into one shared universe. The names he gives his various nations and peoples of the age borrow liberally from actual history and myth. The essay also sets out the racial and geographical heritage of these fictional entities, making them progenitors of modern nations. For example, Howard makes the Gaels descendants of his own Cimmerians.\n\nIn addition to its use as underpinning to his Kull and Conan stories, Howard drew on his invented prehistory in tales with later settings. For instance, \"Kings of the Night\" brings King Kull forward in time to fight the Roman legions, while \"The Haunter of the Ring,\" set in the modern age, makes use of a Hyborian artifact.\n\nAn unnamed Howard fragment published by Glenn Lord features two grave robbers, Allison and Brill, who discover in the Egyptian desert a structure older and different from anything they encountered before. Brill proposes that the structure is Stygian rather than Egyptian, and starts recounting the history of Stygia in nearly identical words to those used in \"The Hyborian Age\" - but making no mention of the Hyborian kingdoms to the north of Stygia. Brill's source for the information is the \"Unaussprechliche Kulte\" (also known as \"Nameless Cults\"), a fictional work of Cthulhu Mythos arcane literature, cited in other Howard stories. This historical exposition seems an earlier draft, which Howard later extended greatly and dropped the grave robbers frame story.\n\nHoward's story \"Men of the Shadows\" includes a long historical narrative, similar in style to \"The Hyborian Age\" but different in detail. \"The Hour of the Dragon\", the only Conan novel authored by Howard, expands upon the history of the world presented in this essay by introducing a new ancient empire called Acheron that had ruled the Hyborian kingdoms in the past.\nRobert Yaple wrote a semi-historical essay entitled \"Acheron - A Revisionary Theory\", emulating the style of Howard's \"The Hyborian Age\", tracing systematically the history of Acheron and integrating it within the data provided in Howard's essay.\n\n\"The Hyborian Age\" was also the name of a fanzine published in the 1930s.\n\nThe essay has been published as follows:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2266430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2266430", "title": "Ace High (1968 film)", "text": "Ace High (1968 film)\n\nAce High (, literally translated as \"The Four of the Hail Mary\") is a 1968 Italian Spaghetti Western film directed and written by Giuseppe Colizzi and starring Terence Hill, Bud Spencer and Eli Wallach. The film is the second in a trilogy started with \"God Forgives... I Don't!\" and ended with \"Boot Hill\".\n\nThe first in the trilogy ended with Cat and Hutch driving a horse wagon in which they possessed the gold from a train robbery (by Bill San Antonio) in \"God Forgives . . . I Don't.\" Bill had apparently died near the end of that movie in a dynamite blast. \"Aces High\" starts with Cat and Hutch arriving in El Paso in wagon apparently with that gold. In El Paso they unsuccessfully try to get bounty for Bill San Antonio from his last earthly remains – no more than Bill's boots and hat, even though they have no body or body parts. Without that bounty they go to the bank manager Harold – which Bill in the first film disclosed as his partner in setting up the robberies – and announce themselves as Bill to see if they are received. After using physical force they are received and convince him (with physical force) to make them a cashier’s check to be paid out in gold.\n\nThe banker visits the condemned man Cacopoulos, who is to be hanged the next day, and offers to help him escape if he restores the money. At night the deputy is knifed by two men, who let Cacopoulos out. He takes the dead man’s gun and shoots the two. He pours himself a footbath and tests the dead men’s boots to find a pair that fits. He then pays a visit to the bank manager. Cacopoulos reminds the manager that he and two others put him in jail for 15 years, and on his release framed him for murder with a stolen knife, that again was used to kill the deputy tonight. Consequently, he wants guarantees that he will not be tricked again. Harold throws the knife but Cacopoulos swings the chair so it strikes in the back, then swings back around and shoots the manager, adding that it is guaranty enough!\n\nDressed as a peon on a donkey Cacopoulos meets Cat and Hutch and robs them. They follow his trail south to Mexico and encounter people that he has given money – and a high wire performer Thomas, and assistant, that he offered money. They catch up with him in a village during a fiesta (that he has paid for). While Cat is lured away looking for him elsewhere, Caco, playing a joke on Hutch, appears before him and, in a quieter place, tells him about Harold and the other two ”friends” who shot his horse so he got caught after a bank robbery, and then framed him for murder. He says that he will give back their money, including what he has spent, if Hutch helps him collect his debts with the remaining two.\n\nThe first one is Paco who is a ”revolutionary” shown presiding over a kangaroo court condemning men to death for ”not fighting for country and freedom.” His men capture Cacopoulos and Hutch, but Cat enlists help from another ”revolutionary,” Canganceiro, by telling him about Cacopoulos´ ”treasure.” Together they defeat Paco’s men and the latter is killed by Cacopoulos, who in his wrath forgets to make him give back any money. After some pillaging by his men, Canganceiro starts another kangaroo court that executes people for ”fighting for country and freedom.” Cacopoulous is jailed until he tells where his treasure is. Caco attempts to escape by lulling the guards to sleep by telling the story of his heritage; his grandfather was a Greek who married a young Cherokee woman, and his father was one of their children. He told of how his father raised his family in a small mining town until he was mysteriously murdered, and how his grandfather, carrying little Caco, had to take his own son's body back to his own tribe. Hutch and Cat then help Cacopoulos escape, but he shoots off their saddles, quoting his grandfather that one partner is too little, and two are too many. They ambush the last two men of the pursuing Canganceiro bunch and take their horses.\n\nThey now follow Cacopoulos in the opposite direction, encountering dead Canganceiro men along the way, the last ones with their leader just outside Memphis. In Memphis they find Caco washing dishes in a saloon, together with the acrobat and assistant – because in this town people are only interested in gambling. That is substantiated by the fact that Cacopoulos has lost all his money while he was looking for Drake the third ”partner.”\n\nCat and Hutch visit Drake’s casino. Hutch loses all his money, while Cat spots the croupier looking at a hole in the ceiling. They put up Hutch to win money in a prizefight, buy weapons and give the rest to Cacopoulos with instruction for him to show up with it in the casino tomorrow.\n\nThat night, with some acrobatic prowess Thomas and Cat gain entrance to a room in the attic of the casino. There is the peek-hole down to the roulette table and a voice tube down to a basement room where a magnet can guide the roulette ball. Cat, Thomas and Hutch take positions in the two rooms. Cacopoulos however, seeks the company of a saloon girl and awakes in the morning robbed of his cash. He hastily replenishes it by forcibly inviting a bill collector to a ”game” of cards that Cacopoulos ”wins.” So Cacopoulos finally enters the casino, where he repeatedly puts the money on 13 until he breaks the bank with a $360,000 win. Drake and his men arrive and confront Cacopoulos leading to a showdown. The opposing parties wait for the roulette ball to stop, while the customers lie down on the floor and a Viennese Waltz is played (on suggestion from Cacopoulos). Drake’s men are shot and he is wounded, and taken by the vengeful customers, who realize they have been swindled. Cacopoulos faints from the shoot-out, but only his arm was wounded, and he leaves together with Cat and Hutch.\n\nIn his investigation of narrative structures in Spaghetti Western films, Fridlund writes that all the Colizzi westerns present clever variations on several different kinds of partnerships encountered in other films inspired by \"For a Few Dollars More\". Also, the pervading protagonists Cat and Hutch are differentiated by a set of physical and personal characteristics that reappear in the even more commercially successful \"They Call Me Trinity\" and \"Trinity Is Still My Name\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2266434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2266434", "title": "Best of all possible worlds", "text": "Best of all possible worlds\n\nThe phrase \"the best of all possible worlds\" (; ) was coined by the German polymath Gottfried Leibniz in his 1710 work \"Essais de Théodicée sur la bonté de Dieu, la liberté de l'homme et l'origine du mal\" (\"Essays of Theodicy on the Goodness of God, the Freedom of Man and the Origin of Evil\"). The claim that the actual world is the best of all possible worlds is the central argument in Leibniz's theodicy, or his attempt to solve the problem of evil.\n\nAmong his many philosophical interests and concerns, Leibniz took on this question of theodicy: If God is omnibenevolent, omnipotent and omniscient, how do we account for the suffering and injustice that exists in the world? Historically, attempts to answer the question have been made using various arguments, for example, by explaining away evil or reconciling evil with good.\n\nLeibniz outlined his perfect world theory in his work \"The Monadology\", stating the argument in five statements: \nTo further understand his argument, these five statements can be grouped in three main premises. The first premise (corresponding to the first and second statements) state that God can only choose one universe from the infinite amount of possible universes. (The term \"one universe\" does not necessarily mean a single three-dimensional physical reality, but refers to the sum total of God's creation, and thus might include multiple worlds.) The second premise (the third and fourth statements) state that God is a perfect existence, and he makes decisions based on reason. The third premise (the fifth statement) concludes that the existing world, chosen by God, is the best.\n\nLeibniz used Christianity to back up the validity of all the premises. For the first premise, God's existence and role as the creator of the world was proven by the Bible. The second premise is proven since \"God acts always in the most perfect and most desirable manner possible\". Therefore, His choice will always be the best, and only perfect existence can make perfect decision throughout time. Since all the premises are right, then Leibniz concluded, \"The universe that God chose to exist is the best of all possible worlds\".\n\nTo begin his argument, Leibniz conceded that God has created a world with evil in it and could have created a world without it. He argued that this is still the best world God could have made by claiming the existence of evil does not necessarily mean a worse world. In fact, he went as far as to claim that evil's presence creates a better world, as “it may happen that the evil is accompanied by a greater good”. In other words, Leibniz argued that the contrast provided by evil can result in the production of a greater good. Without the existence of evil, everything would be good; goodness would no longer appear good, it would simply be normal and expected, no longer praised. As put by Leibniz: “an imperfection in the part may be required for a perfection in the whole”.<ref name=\"Thomson/Wadsworth\"></ref> The reaction people have from evil can allow them to understand and make decisions that bring about a greater good. God allowed evilness in the world for us to understand goodness which is achieved through contrasting it with evil. Once we understood evil and good, it gives us the ability to produce the \"greatest possible good\" out of all the goodness. Evil fuels goodness, which leads to a perfect system.\n\nAlthough this appears like God created evil, which would seem to go against his nature, Leibniz borrowed the same idea Augustine used to fix this issue. “Evil, though real, is not a ‘thing,’ but rather a direction away from the goodness of the One”. Evil is the absence of good and exists in the same way the hole of a donut exists. The donut was created, but one would never say the hole itself was made; it was just never filled in. This also means there cannot be evil without more good, as you can never have the hole in the donut without having donut around it. “God is infinite, and the devil is limited; the good may and does go to infinity, while evil has its bounds”. Using Augustine's model of evil, Leibniz set up the foundation for why a world with evil brings more good, and is therefore better, than a world without evil.\n\nFor Leibniz, an additional central concern is the matter of reconciling human freedom (indeed, God's own freedom) with the determinism inherent in his own theory of the universe. Leibniz' solution casts God as a kind of \"optimizer\" of the collection of all original possibilities: Since he is good and omnipotent, and since he chose this world out of all possibilities, this world must be good—in fact, this world is the best of \"all\" possible worlds.\n\nConsidering the three factors: good, evil, and free will, God created that best possible world he could with the most good and the least evil, with regards to how free will affects people's choices. This is a short summary of Gottfried Leibniz's Best of All Possible Worlds philosophy regarding the \"problem of evil” and how the current world can still be the most viable option. Free will is defined as the “power or capacity to choose among alternatives or to act in certain situations independently of natural, social, or divine restraints”. This basically gives anyone the freedom to do whatever is in their capabilities and inclination—whether it be good or evil. When God breathed the world into existence, He accounted for free will to be a factor of human choice and all the issues it could bring alongside it, as addressed by Leibniz.\n\n“According to Leibniz there are three forms of evil in the world: moral, physical and metaphysical...Since He wills what is best, the world he created has the greatest number of compatible perfections”. These “compatible perfections” are referring to the good and bad effects of choices made through free will. Humans are obviously able to tell the difference from right to wrong, but how they act upon their knowledge is what creates a need for compatibility in the world. God is not the creator of evil, evil is simply the lack of human-induced good. Often, humans make the claim that evil exists because God allowed it into the world, however, “God is not the author of sin”. Sin is necessary in creating the best of all possible worlds and is a result of our free will. There has to be a balance between good and evil in order to maintain the gap between humans and God. If humanity were to be perfect, it would put them on the same level as God, which would destroy the need for grace. Instead, humans are weighed down by their own free will, in perfect contrast to the sovereignty of God. God accommodates for this issue with divine grace and endless mercy to solve the consequences of free will.\n\nIn his writing \"Discourse on Metaphysics\", Leibniz first establishes that God is an absolutely perfect being. He says people can logically conclude this through reason since \"the works must bear the imprint of the workman, because we can learn who he was just by inspecting them\". He calls this the Principle of Perfection, which says that God's knowledge and power is to the highest degree, more so than any human can comprehend. Due to God's omnipotence, Leibniz makes the premise that God has thought of every single possibility there is to be thought of before creating this world. His perfection gives him the ability to think \"beyond the power of a finite mind\", so he has sufficient reason to choose one world over the other.\n\nOut of all the possibilities, God chose the very best world because not only is God powerful, but he is also morally good. He writes \"the happiness of minds is God's principal aim, which He carries out as far as the general harmony will permit\", meaning a benevolent God will only do actions with the intention of good will towards his creation. If one supposed that this world is not the best, then it assumes that the creator of the universe is not knowledgeable enough, powerful enough, or inherently good, for an inherently good God would have created the best world to the best of his ability. It would overall be a contradiction to his good and perfect nature, and so the universe that God has chosen to create can only be the best of all possible worlds.\n\nOn the one hand, this view might help us rationalize some of what we experience: Imagine that all the world is made of good and evil. The best possible world would have the most good and the least evil. Courage is better than no courage. It might be observed, then, that without evil to challenge us, there can be no courage. Since evil brings out the best aspects of humanity, evil is regarded as necessary. So in creating this world God made some evil to make the best of all possible worlds. On the other hand, the theory explains evil not by denying it or even rationalizing it—but simply by declaring it to be part of the optimum combination of elements that comprise the best possible godly choice. Leibniz thus does not claim that the world is overall very good, but that because of the necessary interconnections of goods and evils, God, though omnipotent, could not improve it in one way without making it worse in some other way.\n\nGiovanni Gentile, in his work \"The General Theory of Mind as Pure Act\", claimed that if God had created everything to fall into line with the most favorable possible condition, it would suppose that all of reality is pre-realized and determined in the mind of God. Therefore, the apparent free will displayed by both God, by his necessity of being bound by what is the most good, and humanity in their limitations derived from God to be in line with the most good, are not free wills at all but entirely determinate. Thus ultimately relegated to blind naturalistic processes entrapping both God and humanity to necessity, robbing both of any true freely creative will.\n\nLeibniz, unlike Giovanni, does believe humans have free will despite the predetermined nature of the world. His argument revolves around the idea that “if it is certain that we shall preform them, it is not less certain that we shall choose to preform them.” He maintains that God has chosen this universe and that all things will fall in line with the best world, but we still have choice. For example: if you were to either between vanilla or chocolate ice-cream. You choose chocolate, the choice god knew you would. However, there is a separate, non-perfect, universe in which you chose vanilla. This gives you similar results to Multiverse theory.\n\nLeibniz's multiverse acts differently than ones we are accustomed to. Unlike modern multiverse or even unlike the ancient ideas posed by the atomists in ancient Greek times, Leibniz does not believe all the possible universes exist. Decisions do not create branching universes depending on your decision and there is no other, less perfect universe, existing alongside our own. It is only the perfect universe we live in. This is due to the nature of God choosing the universe. It is as if God sees all the possible universes and chooses the one he wants, the perfect one, and creates only that one.\n\nCritics of Leibniz, such as Voltaire, argue that the world contains an amount of suffering too great to justify optimism. While Leibniz argued that suffering is good because it incites human will, critics argue that the degree of suffering is too severe to justify belief that God has created the \"best of all possible worlds\". Leibniz also addresses this concern by considering what God desires to occur (his antecedent will) and what God allows to occur (his consequent will). Others, such as the Christian philosopher Alvin Plantinga, criticized Leibniz's theodicy by arguing that there probably is not such a thing as \"the best\" of all possible worlds, since one can always conceive a better world, such as a world with one more morally righteous person.\n\nThe \"Theodicy\" was deemed illogical by the philosopher Bertrand Russell. Russell argues that moral and physical evil must result from metaphysical evil (imperfection). But imperfection is merely finitude or limitation; if existence is good, as Leibniz maintains, then the mere existence of evil requires that evil also be good. In addition, libertarian Christian theology (not related to political libertarianism) defines sin as not necessary but contingent, the result of free will. Russell maintains that Leibniz failed to logically show that metaphysical necessity (divine will) and human free will are not incompatible or contradictory. He also claims that when Leibniz analyzes the propositions, he is “ambiguous or doubtful...” (O’Briant). Leibniz does not sound sure and is unsure of himself when he writes his premises. He says they do not work together without making Leibniz sound unsure of himself.\n\nAnother philosopher who weighs into Leibniz's philosophy is Kant. Although Leibniz influenced Kant a great deal, Kant found that Leibnizian philosophy “misleading.” (Kant and Early Moderns). He says that the misleading nature of Leibniz's works is due to the one-sidedness of the theory.\n\nThe physiologist Emil du Bois-Reymond, in his \"Leibnizian Thoughts in Modern Science\" (1870), wrote that Leibniz thought of God as a mathematician:\n\nDu Bois-Reymond went on to argue that even Charles Darwin supported a version of Leibniz's perfect world, since every organism can be understood as relatively adapted to its environment at any point in its evolution. \n\nNonetheless, the statement that \"we live in the best of all possible worlds\" drew scorn, most notably from Voltaire, who lampooned it in his comic novella \"Candide\" by having the character Dr. Pangloss (a parody of Leibniz and Maupertuis) repeat it like a mantra. From this, the adjective \"Panglossian\" describes a person who believes that the world about us is the best possible one.\n\nWhile Leibniz does state this universe is the best possible version of itself, the standard for goodness does not seem clear to many of his critics. To Leibniz, the best universe means a world that is “the simplest in hypotheses and the richest in phenomena”, in addition to the “happiness of minds” being God's main goal. Voltaire, Bertrand Russell, and other critics seem to equate goodness of the universe to no evil or evil acts whatsoever, presuming that a universe that did not contain evil would be \"better\" and that God could have created such a universe, but chose not to. According to Leibniz, that is not the case. He believes that if a better alternative existed “God would have brought it into actuality”. Essentially, Leibniz affirms that no human can truly think up of a better universe because they lack a holistic understanding of the universe, and God, who has that holistic understanding, has already chosen the best option. All of this shifts the meaning of goodness from morality and actions to the quality and phenomena of this universe's existence. Despite that, the concept of the goodness of the universe is still a point of major contention in Leibniz's argument, as someone could always argue about the lack of goodness in the universe based on those parameters.\n\nWhile not directly criticizing Leibniz, Spinoza holds a drastically different view on creation and the universe. Spinoza believes “that everything that God thinks or conceives must also exist”, and he combines God's will and God's understanding where Leibniz separates them. In other words, God cannot imagine an infinite number of worlds and “as a separate act of will” choose one of those to create. How does Spinoza explain creation then? To put it simply, everything in the universe “is a direct result of God's nature”. The moment God thinks of something, it exists. As there are not an infinite amount of universes (according to Spinoza and Leibniz) God must have only conceived of one universe. This, however, still runs into the problem of the existence of evil. How can God, in His perfection, create a world capable of evil if the world is an extension of his mind? In any case, Spinoza still tries to justify a non-infinite basis for the universe, where reality is everything God has ever thought of.\n\nLeibniz's theory leaves much to be desired. He was quite paradoxical in his theory. Leibniz claims that the world we live in now is the best world that could be created. He says in The Monadology that God has the idea of infinitely many worlds. If that is true, why would God make this one as we know it? What makes this one so special? If there are infinite worlds, then would not there be one that is slightly better than this one? And one better than that one? Leibniz to account for this concluded that “there can be no infinite continuum of worlds” (\"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\"). This contradicts his statement that “God has an idea of infinitely many universes?” (Monadology). The problem in Leibniz's philosophy is it has “paradoxical theses” (\"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\"). His thesis is like the question: What came first, the chicken or the egg? His paradoxical thesis is based on his conclusion contradicting his premises.\n\nAquinas, using Scholasticism, treats the \"Best of all possible worlds\" problem in the \"Summa Theologica\" (1273):\n\nHe counters this in general by the \"quinque viae\", and in particular with this refutation:\n\nThe theological theory of pandeism has been classed as a logical derivation of this proposition with the contention that:\n\n\n"}

Orphaned in infancy, he was reared by his grandparents and, at the age of 12, became a telegraph boy in Pittsburgh. Edward J. Allen became an early supporter and patron of John W. Alexander, adopting the orphaned Alexander while he worked at the Pacific and Atlantic Telegraph Co. as a young man. Allen brought Alexander to the Allen home at \"Edgehill\" where Alexander painted various members of the Allen family, including Colonel Allen. His talent at drawing attracted the attention of one of his employers, who assisted him to develop them.\n\nHe moved to New York City at the age of eighteen and worked in an office at \"Harper's Weekly\", where he was an illustrator and political cartoonist at the same time that Abbey, Pennell, Pyle, and other celebrated illustrators labored there. After an apprenticeship of three years, he travelled to Munich for his first formal training. Owing to the lack of funds, he removed to the village of Polling, Bavaria, and worked with Frank Duveneck. They travelled to Venice, where he profited by the advice of Whistler, and then he continued his studies in Florence, the Netherlands, and Paris.\n\nIn 1881 he returned to New York and speedily achieved great success in portraiture, numbering among his sitters Oliver Wendell Holmes, John Burroughs, Henry G. Marquand, R. A. L. Stevenson, and president McCosh of Princeton University.\n\nAlexander was married to Elizabeth Alexander Alexander, to whom he was introduced in part because of their shared last name. Elizabeth was the daughter of James Waddell Alexander, President of the Equitable Life Assurance Society at the time of the Hyde Ball scandal. The Alexanders had one child, the mathematician James Waddell Alexander II.\n\nMany of his paintings are in museums and public places in the United States and in Europe, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Art Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Butler Institute, and the Library of Congress in Washington D.C. In addition, in the entrance hall to the Art Museum of the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh, a series of Alexander's murals entitled \"Apotheosis of Pittsburgh\" (1905–1907) covers the walls of the three-storey atrium area.\n\nAlexander's Artist Proof of his portrait of Whitman, signed by the artist in April 1911, is in the Walt Whitman Collection at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nHis first exhibition in the Paris Salon of 1893 was a brilliant success and was followed by his immediate election to the Société Nationale des Beaux Arts. Many additional honors were bestowed on him. In 1889 he painted for Mrs. Jeremiah Milbank a well-received portrait of Walt Whitman and one of her husband, Jeremiah Milbank. In 1901 he was named Chevalier of the Legion of Honor, and in 1902 he became a member of the National Academy of Design, where he served as President from 1909–1915. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and President of the National Society of Mural Painters. Among the gold medals received by him were those of the Paris Exposition (1900) and the World's Fair at St. Louis (1904).\nHe served as President of the National Society of Mural Painters from 1914 to 1915.\n\nJohn White Alexander died in New York on 31 May 1915.\n\n"}

Currently presented by serving regular police officers, it showcases the work of the Singapore Police Force including solved cases, appeals for unsolved cases, as well as crime prevention advice. It is based on the German programme \"Aktenzeichen XY... ungelöst\", or \"\"File XY... Unsolved\"\". The series premiered on Channel 5 on 30 November 1986 and the Mandarin dubbing (\"绳之以法\") on 7 December on Channel 8. The series later implemented Malay dubs for Suria (\"Jejak Jenayah\") starting in 2000, followed by Tamil's Vasantham (\"Kutra Kannkaanippu\") in 2001.\n\n\"Crimewatch\" first premiered on 30 November 1986 with the first case featuring a case of unsolved murder of a 19-year-old national serviceman and a public appeal from the victim's parents. Less than two weeks after the episode was broadcast, police were able to identify and arrest the suspects based on information provided by viewers responding to the appeal. The series was met with positive reception and it has since aired on a monthly basis starting on 1993 with six episodes, before extending to ten episodes the following year. The series airs with only the Mandarin dubbing during the start, but it has since been extended to Malay in 1993, followed by Tamil in 1994.\n\nEach season of \"Crimewatch\" consist of ten episodes, aired on every end of the month between March and December every year, usually on the third or fourth Sundays (English), or every last Friday (Mandarin) of the month, and every first Monday (Malay) or Thursday (Tamil) of the succeeding month.\n\nEach episode featured a reenactment of crimes in Singapore that plays for the entirely of the episode and a short segment on other advisories (such as the annual Great Singapore Sale).

{"id": "2266452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2266452", "title": "Personality Assessment Inventory", "text": "Personality Assessment Inventory\n\nPersonality Assessment Inventory (PAI), developed by Leslie Morey (1991, 2007), is a self-report 344-item personality test that assesses a respondent's personality and psychopathology. Each item is a statement about the respondent that the respondent rates with a 4-point scale (1-\"Not true at all, False\", 2-\"Slightly true\", 3-\"Mainly true\", and 4-\"Very true\"). It is used in various contexts, including psychotherapy, crisis/evaluation, forensic, personnel selection, pain/medical, and child custody assessment. The test construction strategy for the PAI was primarily deductive and rational. It shows good convergent validity with other personality tests, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory and the Revised NEO Personality Inventory.\n\nThe PAI has 22 non-overlapping scales of four varieties: 1) validity scales, 2) clinical scales, 3) treatment consideration scales, and 4) interpersonal scales.\n\nThe validity scales measure the respondent's overall approach to the test, including faking good or bad, exaggeration, defensiveness, carelessness, or random responding.\n\nThere are also four supplementary validity scales:\n\nFurther identification of exaggeration and/or negative bias can be calculated used the NIM Predicted Profile\n\nAdditionally, one can also apply the use of the Negative Distortion Scale \n\nThe clinical scales measure the respondent's psychopathology using diagnostic categories that were judged by the developers to be relevant based on their historical and contemporary popularity among psychologists. Each clinical scale (except Alcohol Problems and Drug Problems) represents a particular trait, and each scale has sub-scales that represent more specific aspects of that trait.\n\n\nThe treatment consideration scales measure factors that may relate to treatment of clinical disorders or other risk factors but which are not captured in psychiatric diagnoses.\n\n\nThe interpersonal scales measure two factors that affect interpersonal functioning for the respondent. They are based on the circumplex model of emotion classification.\n\n\nThe rationale behind the development of the PAI was to create an assessment tool that would enable the measurement of psychological concepts while maintaining statistical strength. The development methodology was based on several advances that the field of personality assessment was witnessing at the time. Due to the fuzzy nature of constructs (concepts) in psychology, it is very difficult to use criterion-referenced approaches, such as those used in some parts of medicine (e.g. pregnancy tests). This is why construct validation is very important to personality test development. It is usually described as being involved when tests intend to measure some construct that is not \"operationally defined\". The PAI was developed because the authors of the instrument felt that there were a limited number of self-report questionnaires that were using this type of construct validation method to assess areas relevant to diagnoses and treatment planning.\n\nThe developers of the PAI examined various literary sources to come up with the five areas assessed by the PAI (validity of responses, clinical symptoms, interpersonal styles, complications for treatment, and characteristics of one’s environment). Constructs were included if they had been relatively stable in their importance of diagnosing mental disorders over time, and if they were important in contemporary clinical practice. The construct validation approach that was used to construct the PAI was used to maximize two types of validity: content validity and discriminant validity. To ensure that the PAI maximized content validity, each scale had a balanced sample of items that represented a range of important items for each construct. For example, the Depression scale has items involving physical, emotional, and cognitive content (as opposed to only questions about mood or interests). Each scale also assesses a range of severity for that scale; for example, the Suicidal Ideation scale has items that range from vague ideas about suicide to distinct plans for self-harm. To ensure that the PAI maximized discriminant validity, each of the scales should be relatively distinct from one another. For example, if the depression and anxiety scales had many of the same items on them, it would be difficult to tell if elevations on these scales meant that the person was experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety, or both. As such, the developers of the PAI stressed the fact that their measure has no overlapping items to ensure better interpretation of the scales.\n\nThe PAI focuses on the content of psychological concepts. The initial items were written so that the content would be directly relevant to the different constructs measured by the test. These items were rated for their quality, appropriateness, and bias. For example, a bias review panel identified items that could seem to be pathological but are actually normal within a subculture. After ensuring that the PAI addressed certain concepts in psychopathology, the developers proceeded to a second stage in the process. This stage involved the \"empirical evaluation\" of the items. The research team administered two versions of the test, first to a sample of college students and later to a normative sample. These versions were evaluated using several criteria, such as internal consistency of the scales (or how much the items in one scale correlate with each other). The ability to fake good or bad while taking the test was also evaluated using a sample of college students that were given different instructions on how to answer the test.\n\nThe PAI is often used in forensics and corrections, where increasing support for its validity has been noted. The PAI has a number of strengths for applied psychological assessment. First, the 4-point scale contributes to greater scale reliability and validity, as it provides respondents with the opportunity to give nuanced ratings of themselves (as opposed to a true-false scale). Second, it is relatively economical, assessing most of the constructs that are widely considered important in clinical personality assessment with only 344 items. Third, nearly all of the PAI items are readable at the 4th grade level. Brevity and straightforward item wording reduce the administrative burden on respondents. The lower reading level makes it accessible to those with lower levels of intelligence and reading ability. Fourth, the responses from each individual's profile can be compared to multiple large samples. The first sample consists of 1,000 people with similar demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity) to the U.S. Census data. Comparison with this group is useful to detect and estimate the severity of clinical problems relative to the average person. The second sample consists of 1,265 psychiatric patients. Comparison with this group helps assess the severity of psychopathology among other patients. There is also a sample of 1200 offenders from multiple correctional settings and a further sample of 1051 college students.\n\nAll of the constructs measured by the PAI are commonly used by psychologists and are named in such a way that they can be readily understood. Unlimited-use interpretive software that was written by the test author is available from the publisher, as well as an adolescent version of the test, the Personality Assessment Inventory-Adolescent (PAI-A), developed for use with adolescents 12 to 18 years of age; consisting of 264 items. This measure requires only fourth-grade reading level and takes only 45 minutes to complete. The PAI-A also has the advantage of assessing borderline features, which most other instruments used with adolescents do not include. The Personality Assessment Screener ) is a 22-item instrument that provides an index of the likelihood that an important clinical elevation would occur on the PAI. This screening tool can be used as an adjunct to the PAI in appropriate circumstances. Straightforward scale names combined with the interpretive and diagnostic hypotheses provided in the computer report limit the burden on the examiner.\n\nThere are also a number of psychometric (statistical) strengths of the PAI, importantly including content validity and discriminant validity (for a detailed review of the PAI and its validity, see.)\n\nFinally, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest the PAI has both clinical and forensic validity \n\nBecause the PAI does not measure some constructs that might be of concern in clinical assessment (e.g., eating disorders), it is often useful to supplement the PAI with other measures. Caution should be exercised in interpreting PAI data from non-English speakers or when administration breaks from the standard administration, as is the case for all psychometric instruments.\n\n"}

{"id": "2266487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2266487", "title": "Problem solving environment", "text": "Problem solving environment\n\nA problem solving environment (PSE) is a completed, integrated and specialised computer software for solving one class of problems, combining automated problem-solving methods with human-oriented tools for guiding the problem resolution. A PSE may also assist users in formulating problem resolution. A PSE may also assist users in formulating problems, selecting algorithm, simulating numerical value and viewing and analysing results.\n\nMany PSEs were introduced in the 1990s. They use the language of the respective field and often employ modern graphical user interfaces. The goal is to make the software easy to use for specialists in fields other than computer science. PSEs are available for generic problems like data visualization or large systems of equations and for narrow fields of science or engineering like gas turbine design.\n\nThe Problem Solving Environment (PSE) released a few years after the release of Fortran and Algol 60. People thought that this system with high-level language would cause elimination of professional programmers. However, surprisingly, PSE has been accepted and even though scientists used it to write programs.\n\nThe Problem Solving Environment for Parallel Scientific Computation was introduced in 1960, where this was the first Organised Collections with minor standardisation. In 1970, PSE was initially researched for providing high-class programming language rather than Fortran, also Libraries Plotting Packages advent. Development of Libraries were continued, and there were introduction of Emergence of Computational Packages and Graphical systems which is data visualisation. By 1990s, hypertext, point-and-click had moved towards inter-operability. Moving on, a \"Software Parts\" Industry finally existed.\n\nThroughout a few decades, recently, many PSEs have been developed and to solve problem and also support users from different categories, including education, general programming, CSE software learning, job executing and Grid/Cloud computing.\n\nThe shell software GOSPEL is an example of how a PSE can be designed for EHL modelling using a Grid resource. With the PSe, one can visualise the optimisation progress, as well as interact with other simulations.\n\nThe PSE parallelise and embed many individual numerical calculations in an individual numerical calculations in an industrial serial optimisation code. It is built in NAG's IRIS Explorer package to solve EHL and Parallelism problems and can use the gViz libraries, to run all the communication between the PSE and the simulation. Also use MPI, which is part of the NAG libraries, gives significant quick and better solution by combining the max. levels of continuation.\n\nMoreover, the system is designed to allow users to steer simulations using visualised output. An example is utilising local minima, or layering additional details when around a local in and out of the simulation and it can imagine the information which is produced in any sharp and also still allow to steer the simulation.\n\nPSEs are require a large amount of resources that strain even the most powerful computers of today. Translating PSEs into software that can be used for mobile devices in an important challenge that faces programmers today.\n\nGrid computing is seen as a solution to the rescue issues of PSEs for mobile devices. This is made possible through a \"Brokering Service\". This service is started by an initiating device that sends the necessary information for PSE to resolve task. The brokering service then breaks this down into subtasks that distributes the information to various subordinate devices that perform these subtasks. The brokering necessitates an Active Agent Repository (AAR) and a Task Allocation Table (TAT) that both work to manage the subtasks. A Keep-Alive Server is tapped to handle communication between the brokering service and the subordinate devices. The Keep-Alive server relies on a lightweight client application installed in the participating mobile devices.\n\nSecurity, transparency and dependability are issues that may arise when using the grid for mobile device-based PSEs.\n\nThere are a revolution for network-based learning and e-learning for education but it is very difficult to collect education data and data of the student activities. TSUNA-TASTE, is developed by T. Teramoto, a PSE to support education and learning processes. This system may create a new idea of the e-learning by supporting teachers and students in computer-related education. It consists of four parts, including agents of students, an education support server, a database system and a Web server. This system makes e-learning more convenient as information is earlier to store and collect for students and teachers.\n\nA computer-assisted parallel program generation support(P-NCAS), is a PSE, creates a new way to reduce the programming hard task for the computer programming. This program can avoid or reduce the chance that huge computer software breaking down so this restrict uncertainty and major accidents in the society. Moreover, partial differential equations(PDEs) problems can be solved by parallel programs which are generated by P-NCAS supports. P-NCAS employs the Single Program Multi Data (SPMD) and uses a decomposition method for the parallelisation. These enable users of P-NCAS to input problems described by PDES, algorithm and discretisation scheme etc., and to view and edit all details through the visualisation and windows for edition. At last, parallel program will be outputted in C language by P-NCAS and also include documents which show everything has inputted in the beginning.\n\nFirstly, it was difficult doing 2-D EHL problems because of the expense and computer power available. The development of parallel 2-D EHL codes and faster computers have now paved the way for 2-D EHL problem solving to be possible. Friction and lubricant data need a higher level of security given their sensitivity. Accounting for simulations may be difficult because these are done in rapidly and in the thousands. This can be solved by a registration system or a 'directory'. Collaborative PSEs with multiple users will encounter difficulties tracking changes, especially which specific changes were made and when those changes were made. This may also be solved with a directory of changes made.\n\nSecondly, future improvement of the Grid-based PSEs for mobile devices, the group aims to generate new scenarios through manipulation of the control variables available. By changing those control variables, the simulation software is able to create scenarios from each other, allowing for more scrutiny of the conditions in each scenario. It is expected that manipulation of three variables will generate twelve different scenarios.\n\nThe variables that we are interested in studying are network stability and device mobility. We feel that these variables will hater the greatest impact on grid performance. Our study will measure performance using task completion time as the primary outcome.\n\nAs PSEs grow more complex, the need for computing resources has risen dramatically. Conversely, with PSE applications venturing into fields and environments of growing complexity, the creation of PSEs have become tedious and difficult.\n\nHirumichi Kobashi and his colleagues have designed a PSE meant to create other PSEs. This has been dubbed as a 'meta PSE' or a PSEs. This was how PSE Park was born.\n\nThe architecture of PSE Park emphasises flexibility and extensibility. These characteristics make it an attractive platform for varied levels of expertise, from entry-level users to developers.\n\nPSE Park provides these through its repository of functions. the repository contains modules required to build PSEs. Some of the most basic modules, called Cores, are used as the foundation of PSEs. More complex modules are available for use by programmers. Users access PSE Park through a console linked to the programmers. Once the user is register, he/she has assess to the repository. A PIPE server is used as the mediator between the user and PSE Park. It grants access to modules and constructs the selected functions into a PSE.\n\nDevelopers can develop functions, or even whole PSEs, for inclusion into the repository. Entry-level and expert users can access these pre-made PSEs for their own purposes. Given this architecture, PSE Park requires a cloud computing environment to support the enormous data sharing that occurs during PSE use and development.\n\nThe PIPE Server differs from other servers in terms of how it handles intermediate results. Since the PIPE Server acts as a mediator in a meta-PSE, any results or variables generated by a core module are retrieved as global variables to be used by the next core. The sequence or hierarchy is defined by the user. The way, same name variables are revised to the new set of variables.\n\nAnother important characteristics of the PIPE Server is that it executes each module or core independently. This means that the language of each module does not have to be the same as the others in the PSE. Modules are implemented depending on the defined hierarchy. This feature brings enormous flexibility for developers and users who have varied backgrounds in programming. The modular format also enables that existing PSEs can be extended and modified easily.\n\nIn order be registered, a core must be fully defined. The input and output definitions allow the PIPE server to determine compatibility with other cores and modules. Any lack of definition is flagged by the PIPE server for incompatibility.\n\nThe registration engine keeps track of all cores that may be used in PSE Park. A history of use is also created.

{"id": "2266492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2266492", "title": "Rowland Hill", "text": "Rowland Hill\n\nSir Rowland Hill, KCB, FRS (3 December 1795 – 27 August 1879) was an English teacher, inventor and social reformer. He campaigned for a comprehensive reform of the postal system, based on the concept of Uniform Penny Post and his solution of pre-payment, facilitating the safe, speedy and cheap transfer of letters. Hill later served as a government postal official, and he is usually credited with originating the basic concepts of the modern postal service, including the invention of the postage stamp.\n\nHill made the case that if letters were cheaper to send, people, including the poorer classes, would send more of them, thus eventually profits would go up. Proposing an adhesive stamp to indicate pre-payment of postage – with the first being the Penny Black – in 1840, the first year of Penny Post, the number of letters sent in the UK more than doubled. Within 10 years, it had doubled again. Within three years postage stamps were introduced in Switzerland and Brazil, a little later in the US, and by 1860, they were in 90 countries.\n\nHill was born in Blackwell Street, Kidderminster, Worcestershire, England. Rowland's father, Thomas Wright Hill, was an innovator in education and politics, including among his friends Joseph Priestley, Tom Paine and Richard Price. At the age of 12, Rowland became a student-teacher in his father's school. He taught astronomy and earned extra money fixing scientific instruments. He also worked at the Assay Office in Birmingham and painted landscapes in his spare time.\n\nIn 1827, he married Caroline Pearson, who died on 27 May 1881, originally from Wolverhampton. Together they had four children, daughters Eleanor, Clara and Louisa and a son Pearson.\n\nIn 1819 he moved his father's school \"Hill Top\" from central Birmingham, establishing the Hazelwood School at Edgbaston, an affluent neighbourhood of Birmingham, as an \"educational refraction of Priestley's ideas\". Hazelwood was to provide a model for public education for the emerging middle classes, aiming for useful, pupil-centred education which would give sufficient knowledge, skills and understanding to allow a student to continue self-education through a life \"most useful to society and most happy to himself\". The school, which Hill designed, included innovations such as a science laboratory, a swimming pool, and forced air heating. In his \"Plans for the Government and Liberal Instruction of Boys in Large Numbers Drawn from Experience\" (1822, often cited as \"Public Education\") he argued that kindness, instead of caning, and moral influence, rather than fear, should be the predominant forces in school discipline. Science was to be a compulsory subject, and students were to be self-governing.\n\nHazelwood gained international attention when French education leader and editor Marc Antoine Jullien, former secretary to Maximilien de Robespierre, visited and wrote about the school in the June 1823 issue of his journal \"Revue encyclopédique\". Jullien even transferred his son there. Hazelwood so impressed Jeremy Bentham that in 1827 a branch of the school was created at Bruce Castle in Tottenham, London. In 1833, the original Hazelwood School closed and its educational system was continued at the new Bruce Castle School, of which Hill was head master from 1827 until 1839.\n\nThe colonisation of South Australia was a project of Edward Gibbon Wakefield, who believed that many of the social problems in Britain were caused by overcrowding and overpopulation. In 1832 Rowland Hill published a tract called \"Home colonies : sketch of a plan for the gradual extinction of pauperism, and for the diminution of crime\", based on a Dutch model. Hill then served from 1833 until 1839 as secretary of the South Australian Colonization Commission, which worked successfully to establish a settlement without convicts at what is today Adelaide. The political economist Robert Torrens was chairman of the Commission. Under the South Australia Act 1834, the colony was to embody the ideals and best qualities of British society, shaped by religious freedom and a commitment to social progress and civil liberties. Rowland Hill's sister Caroline Clark, husband Francis and their large family migrated to South Australia in 1850.\n\nRowland Hill first started to take a serious interest in postal reforms in 1835. In 1836 Robert Wallace, MP, provided Hill with numerous books and documents, which Hill described as a \"half hundred weight of material\". Hill commenced a detailed study of these documents and this led him to publish, in early 1837, a pamphlet called \"Post Office Reform its Importance and Practicability\". He submitted a copy of this to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Thomas Spring Rice, on 4 January 1837. This first edition was marked \"private and confidential\" and was not released to the general public. The Chancellor summoned Hill to a meeting in which the Chancellor suggested improvements, asked for reconsiderations and requested a supplement, which Hill duly produced and supplied on 28 January 1837.\nIn the 1830s at least 12.5% of all British mail was conveyed under the personal frank of peers, dignitaries and members of parliament, while censorship and political espionage were conducted by postal officials. Fundamentally, the postal system was mismanaged, wasteful, expensive and slow. It had become inadequate for the needs of an expanding commercial and industrial nation. There is a well-known story, probably apocryphal, about how Hill gained an interest in reforming the postal system; he apparently noticed a young woman too poor to claim a letter sent to her by her fiancé. At that time, letters were normally paid for by the recipient, not the sender. The recipient could simply refuse delivery. Frauds were commonplace: for example, coded information could appear on the cover of the letter; the recipient would examine the cover to gain the information, and then refuse delivery to avoid payment. Each individual letter had to be logged. In addition, postal rates were complex, depending on the distance and the number of sheets in the letter.\n\nRichard Cobden and John Ramsey McCulloch, both advocates of free trade, attacked the policies of privilege and protection of the Tory government. McCulloch, in 1833, advanced the view that \"nothing contributes more to facilitate commerce than the safe, speedy and cheap conveyance of letters.\" \nHill's pamphlet, \"Post Office Reform: its Importance and Practicability\", referred to above, was circulated privately in 1837. The report called for \"low and uniform rates\" according to weight, rather than distance. Hill's study reported his findings and those of Charles Babbage that most of the costs in the postal system were not for transport, but rather for laborious handling procedures at the origins and the destinations. Costs could be reduced dramatically if postage were prepaid by the sender, the prepayment to be proven by the use of prepaid letter sheets or adhesive stamps (adhesive stamps had long been used to show payment of taxes, on documents for example). Letter sheets were to be used because envelopes were not yet common; they were not yet mass-produced, and in an era when postage was calculated partly on the basis of the number of sheets of paper used, the same sheet of paper would be folded and serve for both the message and the address. In addition, Hill proposed to lower the postage rate to a penny per half ounce, without regard to distance. He first presented his proposal to the Government in 1837.\n\nIn the House of Lords the Postmaster, Lord Lichfield, a Whig, denounced Hill's \"wild and visionary schemes.\" William Leader Maberly, Secretary to the Post Office, also a Whig, denounced Hill's study: \"This plan appears to be a preposterous one, utterly unsupported by facts and resting entirely on assumption\". But merchants, traders and bankers viewed the existing system as corrupt and a restraint of trade. They formed a \"Mercantile Committee\" to advocate for Hill's plan and pushed for its adoption. In 1839 Hill was given a two-year contract to run the new system.\n\nFrom 1839 to 1842, Hill lived at 1 Orme Square, Bayswater, London, and there is an LCC plaque there in his honour.\nThe Uniform Fourpenny Post rate lowered the cost to fourpence from 5 December 1839, then to the penny rate on 10 January 1840, even before stamps or letter sheets could be printed. The volume of paid internal correspondence increased dramatically, by 120%, between November 1839 and February 1840. This initial increase resulted from the elimination of \"free franking\" privileges and fraud.\n\nPrepaid letter sheets, with a design by William Mulready, were distributed in early 1840. These Mulready envelopes were not popular and were widely satirised. According to a brochure distributed by the National Postal Museum (now the British Postal Museum & Archive), the Mulready envelopes threatened the livelihoods of stationery manufacturers, who encouraged the satires. They became so unpopular that the government used them on official mail and destroyed many others.\n\nHowever, as a niche commercial publishing industry for machine-printed illustrated envelopes subsequently developed in Britain and elsewhere, it is likely that it was the sentiment of the illustration that provoked the ridicule and led to their withdrawal. Indeed, in the absence of examples of machine-printed illustrated envelopes before this, the Mulready envelope may be recognised as a significant innovation in its own right. Machine-printed illustrated envelopes are a mainstay of the direct mail industry.\n\nIn May 1840 the world's first adhesive postage stamps were distributed. With an elegant engraving of the young Queen Victoria (whose 21st birthday was celebrated that month), the Penny Black was an instant success. Refinements, such as perforations to ease the separation of the stamps, were instituted with later issues.\n\nRowland Hill continued at the Post Office until the Conservative Party won the 1841 General Election. Sir Robert Peel returned to office on 30 August 1841 and served until 29 June 1846. Amid rancorous controversy, Hill was dismissed in July 1842. However, the London and Brighton Railway named him a director and later chairman of the board, from 1843 to 1846. He lowered the fares from London to Brighton, expanded the routes, offered special excursion trains, and made the commute comfortable for passengers. In 1844 Edwin Chadwick, Rowland Hill, John Stuart Mill, Lyon Playfair, Dr. Neill Arnott, and other friends formed a society called \"Friends in Council,\" which met at each other's houses to discuss questions of political economy. Hill also became a member of the influential Political Economy Club, founded by David Ricardo and other classical economists, but now including many powerful businessmen and political figures.\n\nIn 1846 the Conservative party split over the repeal of the Corn Laws and was replaced by a Whig government led by Lord Russell. Hill was made Secretary to the Postmaster General, and then Secretary to the Post Office from 1854 until 1864. For his services Hill was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1860. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society and awarded an honorary degree from University of Oxford.\n\nHill died in Hampstead, London in 1879. He is buried in Westminster Abbey; there is a memorial to him on his family grave in Highgate Cemetery. There are streets named after him in Hampstead (off Haverstock Hill, down the side of the Royal Free Hospital) and Tottenham (off White Hart Lane). A Royal Society of Arts blue plaque, unveiled in 1893, commemorates Hill at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead.\n\nHill has two legacies. The first was his model for education of the emerging middle classes. The second was his model for an efficient postal system to serve business and the public, including the postage stamp and the system of low and uniform postal rates, which is often taken for granted in the modern world. In this, he not only changed postal services around the world, but also made commerce more efficient and profitable, even though it took 30 years before the British Post Office's revenue recovered to its 1839 level. The Uniform Penny Post continued in the UK into the 20th century, and at one point, one penny (1d) paid for up to four ounces (113 g).\n\nThere are three public statues of Hill. The earliest is in Birmingham: a Carrara marble sculpture by Peter Hollins unveiled in 1870. Its location was moved in 1874, 1891 (when it was placed in the City's General Post Office) and 1934. In 1940 it was removed for safe keeping for the duration of the Second World War.\n\nA marble statue in Kidderminster, Hill's birthplace, was sculpted by Sir Thomas Brock and unveiled in June 1881. It is at the junction of Vicar and Exchange Streets. Hill is prominent in Kidderminster's community history. There is a J D Wetherspoon pub called The Penny Black in the town centre and a large shopping mall linking Vicar Street and Worcester Street is named The Rowland Hill Shopping Centre.\n\nIn London a bronze statue by Edward Onslow Ford, also made in 1881, stands in King Edward Street.\nThere are at least two marble busts of Hill, also unveiled in 1881. One, by W. D. Keyworth, Jr., is in St Paul's Chapel, Westminster Abbey. Another, by William Theed, is in Albert Square, Manchester.\n\nIn recognition of his contributions to the development of the modern postal system, Rowland Hill is commemorated at the Universal Postal Union, the UN agency charged with regulating the international postal system. His name appears on one of the two large meeting halls at the UPU headquarters in Berne, Switzerland.\n\nAt Tottenham, north London, there is a local history museum at Bruce Castle (where Hill lived during the 1840s) including some relevant exhibits.\n\nThe Rowland Hill Awards, started by the Royal Mail and the British Philatelic Trust in 1997, are annual awards for philatelic \"innovation, initiative and enterprise.\"\n\nIn 1882 the Post Office instituted the Rowland Hill Fund for postal workers, pensioners and dependants in need.\n\nFor the centenary of the first stamp, Portugal issued a miniature sheet with 8 stamps mentioning his name. Later, on his death centenary, an omnibus issue of stamps commemorating Hill was produced by about 80 countries. Altogether, 147 countries have issued stamps commemorating him.\n\n\n\n"}

Team. It was initially released on British label Memphis Industries on 13 September 2004, but was quickly reworked to avoid legal issues and re-released in October 2005. \n\nThe album was the project of founder member Ian Parton, who over the course of 2003 recorded demos and musical ideas after work onto many dozens of cassettes using a lo-fi 4-track recorder, and titled each tape with a potential song name idea. Each track on the album was created by combining five or six different ideas from this large assortment of tapes, trying out different chorus sections from one with the verse section of another, to give the music an overall feeling of constantly switching radio channels. 'Get It Together' was the first track Parton created where he felt he'd got the juxtaposition of differing styles within one song right, giving him the template and direction for the rest of the album.\n\nRecording took place in both the garage and kitchen of Parton's parents' house in Swansea while they were away on holiday, with him playing all live instruments himself (as at that time there were no other members of the band). The album was co-produced by his sound engineer brother Gareth Parton, who helped Ian set up the makeshift home recording facility in Wales, and later mixed the tracks at The Fortress Studios and Bluestone in London.\n\nThe original 2004 Memphis Industries release of the album (sometimes referred to as the 'Illegal version') had had none of its many samples cleared, as Parton didn't expect the album to attract much attention. However \"Thunder, Lightning, Strike\" received wide critical acclaim and was later nominated for the 2005 Mercury Music Prize. Thereupon a 'legally clean' version of the album was painstakingly recreated by the Parton brothers, containing only cleared or interpolated samples, and rewritten, resung lyrics, all under the guidance of a legal musicologist. Junior Kickstart, Bottle Rocket and Ladyflash were among the most heavily reworked tracks, whilst Get It Together was one of a few tracks that remained untouched. This revised 'legal' version of the album was re-released in the United Kingdom and the United States by Columbia Records in October 2005, with two additional bonus tracks. The album peaked at number 48 on the UK Albums Chart in February 2006, some 18 months after its original release.\n\nReception to \"Thunder, Lightning, Strike\" was very positive.

In the late 10th century, they were continued by the Lutici. In Einhard's \"Vita Karoli Magni\", the Wilzi are said to refer to themselves as \"Welatabians\".\n\nThe name \"Veleti\" stems from the root \"vel-\" ('high, tall'). The Veleti were called by other names, probably given by their neighbours, such as \"Lutices\", \"Ljutici\", or \"Volki\", \"Volčki\". The latter means 'wolf', and the former probably 'fierce creature' based upon the comparison with the Russian form \"lyutyj zvěr\".\"\"\n\nThe first mention of a tribe named Veltae is founding Ptolemy's Geography where, writing in the second century, Ptolemy states in Book III, chapter V: \"Back from the Ocean, near the Venedicus Bay [Baltic Sea], the Veltae dwell, above whom are the Ossi.\" The Bavarian Geographer's anonymous medieval document compiled in Regensburg in 830 contains a list of the tribes in Central Europe east of the Elbe. Among other tribes it also lists the \"Uuilci\" (Veleti), featuring 95 civitates.\n\nThe Veleti did not remain a unified tribe for long. Local tribes developed, the most important being: the Kissini (\"Kessiner\", \"Chizzinen\", \"Kyzziner\") along the lower Warnow and Rostock, named after their capital Kessin; the Circipani (\"Zirzipanen\") along the Trebel and Peene Rivers, with their capital believed to be Teterow and strongholds in Demmin and probably even Güstrow; the Tollenser east and south of the Peene along the Tollense River; and the Redarier south and east of the Tollensesee on the upper Havel. The Hevelli living in the Havel area and, though more unlikely, the Rujanes of Rugia might once have been part of the Veletians. Even the \"Leitha\" region of Lower Austria may have been named for a tribe of Veneti, the \"Leithi\".\n\nThis political splitting of the Veleti probably occurred due to the size of the inhabited area, with settlements grouped around rivers and forts and separated by large strips of woodlands. Also, the Veletian king Dragowit had been defeated and made a vassal by Charlemagne in the only expedition into Slavic territory led by Charlemagne himself, in 798, causing the central Veletian rule to collapse. The Veleti were invaded by the Franks during their continuous expeditions into Obodrite lands, with the Obodrites being allies of the Franks against the Saxons.

The car used the chassis and engine of the by then defunct Fiat/SEAT 850 and featured a new body in the style of the contemporary, somewhat smaller and only indirectly related Fiat 126.\n\nThe car was first exhibited at the Barcelona Motor Show in May 1974. Noteworthy at that time was the compression ratio of only 8:1, which permitted the car to run on 85 octane petrol/gasoline. This was still appropriate in Spain, but elsewhere in western Europe even \"regular\" fuel grades by now generally guaranteed a higher minimum octane rating.\n\nThe 133's design premise was that it had to be a cheap car both to develop and build. Thus, the final product inherited most of its components from the SEAT 850 (or very closely related Fiat 850). As with the 850, it was a rear-wheel drive, rear-engined car – a layout that was being supplanted by front-engined, front-wheel drive hatchbacks like the Renault 5 and Fiat's own Fiat 127 at the time.\nThe 133 effectively replaced the SEAT 850 and the SEAT 600 both of which had been produced in considerable numbers with around 800,000 of the more venerable 600 built – almost exclusively for the domestic market - by 1974.\n\nIt was developed in Spain by SEAT, with which Italian company Fiat had signed an agreement of collaboration in the 1950s. Initially the 133 was only sold in Spain and did not enjoy great success, since it suffered from frequent overheating problems. It was intended to replace the old 600 and 850 models, and was also meant to provide a means for SEAT to open new markets and make up for the loss of sales in Spain that would come with the disappearance of the restrictions in car imports during the 1970s. Export rates were higher than for the 133's predecessors (as well as the remainder of the SEAT range), reaching 36.7 percent in 1976. The SEAT 133 was exported to Germany from the autumn/Fall of 1974: there it found some success among rear-wheel-drive loyalists in the mid-seventies. It was also sold in Britain from June 1975. These countries had no SEAT dealership network at the time, and the cars were branded as Fiat 133s, to be marketed alongside the Fiats 126 and 127. The 133 later enjoyed success in other parts of the world, such as Egypt for example, where the car was kept in production for much longer.\n\nReflecting the rear engine lay-out, there was just a small well for parcels behind the back seats, with more room for luggage under the 'bonnet/hood' at the front of the car.\n\nUp to 200,000 SEAT 133s had been produced by 1979 in Spain. A further 15,821 were made in the Fiat/Sevel Plant at Córdoba in Argentina between 1977 and 1982.\n\nIn April 1977, it was announced that Egypt was about to become the world's 32nd car-producing country. This followed the signing of an agreement for the shipment of CKD kits from Seat's Barcelona plant to the Helwan premises of the Nasr Automotive Manufacturing Company for assembly, in order to supply the Egyptian market and for export to Iraq.\n\nFiat 133 was the name used for the car in certain export markets where the SEAT brand was unknown. Around 127,000 units were exported, mostly under the Fiat name.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1980 the Fiat Argentine subsidiary built them, also under the Fiat name.\n\nThe 133 is also popular in the low-budget Finnish motorsport called Jokkis, where over 30 percent of the drivers drive Fiat 133s.\n"}

The SEAT 131 was presented on May 1975 in the Barcelona Motor Show.\n\nWith SEAT having formed a partnership with Fiat, the SEAT 131 was a rebadged version of the Fiat 131, which had been presented nine months earlier in Turin. It received a few locally produced engines and other concessions to the Spanish market. The SEAT 131 entered production in early 1975 in Barcelona and up to the end of its production life cycle 412,948 units were produced.\n\nTwo sedan versions were offered: the \"SEAT 131 L\", featuring rectangular front lamps, 1438 cc OHC engine and four-speed gearbox, and the \"SEAT 131 E\" which featured four round headlamps, a 1592 cc DOHC engine, and a five-speed gearbox.\n\nThe range grew up in the spring of 1976 with the \"SEAT 131 5 puertas\" unofficially known as the SEAT 131 Familiar, which was the estate version offered with both engines. In 1977 the 131 Automatico (Automatic gearbox) was released and the following year a very short production of the SEAT 131 CLX 1800 was offered. Spain was the only place where the estate 131 was built, but in the export these were labelled Fiat 131 Familiare (\"Panorama\" after a facelift).\n\nIn 1978, the SEAT 131 evolves into the SEAT 131 Mirafiori/Supermirafiori (Panorama for the estate versions), with the same changes as seen on its Italian cousin. The engines remained largely the same, but a 1.8 liter Diesel Perkins 4.108 engine was available in 1979. In 1981, the Diesel version was developed with a new Sofim engine. This 2500 cc engine was much more powerful than the Perkins version (72 hp against only 49 hp) and was one of the most successful taxis in early '80s Spain.\n\nA new CLX edition was launched in 1980. Available only in metallic silver or metallic bronze colours, this 131 CLX had a 1919 cc engine, developing at 5800 rpm.\n\nIn 1982, the SEAT 131 changed again, gathering all the body changes seen on the Fiat 131 series 3. The 131 was now available in CL, Supermirafiori and Diplomatic versions. The Diplomatic was the top of the range, with a 1,995 cc engine and features such as power steering, power windows or air conditioning. The Panorama versions were the cars chosen by the \"Cuerpo Nacional de Policia\" (Spanish Police force) as patrol cars. In 1984, the whole SEAT 131 range was phased out, without a direct substitute. The brand new Fiat Regata-based SEAT Málaga took its place in 1985.\n\nThe implementation of the diesel engines in the SEAT 131 range took place almost four years after its launch. This would practically exclude the use of the SEAT 131 in the taxi fleet, in spite of its significant performance in both comfort and roominess. In the meantime however, for a great number of Spanish taxi owners and other professionals who were opting for the SEAT 131 as their taxicab of choice, a very common practice was the after-market replacement with a diesel engine of a newly purchased gasoline-powered SEAT 131. Engines that were widely used for this purpose were derived from Perkins, Barreiros, Mercedes-Benz and Sava, but the most widespread option was the 52CV Sava 1,795 cc engine.\n\n"}

During his teen years, Rich would sneak out of his house to fulfill his “glittery crowd calling” at Club I-Beam in San Francisco's famed Haight-Ashbury. While dancing on the bar, Rich was asked what his club name was. He easily replied “Richie Rich of course!!!.”\n\nThe Club Kid name “Richie Rich” derived from his experience at the hands of childhood classmates from kindergarten who jokingly teased...\"Hey Richie Rich, where’s your dog Dollar?” ; and with blonde hair and blue eyes, Richie owned the moniker.” While maintaining straights A’s during the day and unbeknownst to his parents, Richie Rich became synonymous with the San Francisco nightlife scene.\n\nIn the fall of 1992 club kid diva, Julie Jules, encouraged Rich to enter the “Club Kid Style Summit” contest.

It is possible to count from 0 to 31 (2 − 1) using the fingers of a single hand, from 0 through 1023 (2 − 1) if both hands are used, or from 0 to 1,048,575 (2 − 1) if the toes on both feet are used as well.\n\nIn the binary number system, each numerical digit has two possible states (0 or 1) and each successive digit represents an increasing power of two.\n\nNote: What follows is but one of several possible schemes for assigning the values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. to fingers, not necessarily the best. (see below the illustrations.): The rightmost digit represents two to the zeroth power (i.e., it is the \"ones digit\"); the digit to its left represents two to the first power (the \"twos digit\"); the next digit to the left represents two to the second power (the \"fours digit\"); and so on. (The decimal number system is essentially the same, only that powers of ten are used: \"ones digit\", \"tens digit\" \"hundreds digit\", etc.)\n\nIt is possible to use anatomical digits to represent numerical digits by using a raised finger to represent a binary digit in the \"1\" state and a lowered finger to represent it in the \"0\" state. Each successive finger represents a higher power of two.\n\nWith palms oriented toward the counter's face, the values for when only the right hand is used are:\n\nWhen only the left hand is used:\n\nWhen both hands are used:\n\nAnd, alternately, with the palms oriented away from the counter:\nThe values of each raised finger are added together to arrive at a total number. In the one-handed version, all fingers raised is thus 31 (16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1), and all fingers lowered (a fist) is 0. In the two-handed system, all fingers raised is 1,023 (512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1) and two fists (no fingers raised) represents 0.\n\nIt is also possible to have each hand represent an independent number between 0 and 31; this can be used to represent various types of paired numbers, such as month and day, X-Y coordinates, or sports scores (such as for table tennis or baseball).\n\nWhen used in addition to the right.\n\nJust as fractional and negative numbers can be represented in binary, they can be represented in finger binary. \n\nRepresenting negative numbers is extremely simple, by using the leftmost finger as a sign bit: raised means the number is negative, in a sign-magnitude system. Anywhere between -511 and +511 can be represented this way, using two hands. Note that, in this system, both a positive and a negative zero may be represented.\n\nIf a convention were reached on palm up/palm down or fingers pointing up/down representing positive/negative, you could maintain 2 - 1 in both positive and negative numbers (-1023 to +1023, with positive and negative zero still represented).\n\nThere are multiple ways of representing fractions in finger binary.\n\nFractions can be stored natively in a binary format by having each finger represent a fractional power of two: formula_1. (These are known as dyadic fractions.)\n\nUsing the left hand only:\n\nUsing two hands:\n\nThe total is calculated by adding all the values in the same way as regular (non-fractional) finger binary, then dividing by the largest fractional power being used (32 for one-handed fractional binary, 1024 for two-handed), and simplifying the fraction as necessary.\n\nFor example, with thumb and index finger raised on the left hand and no fingers raised on the right hand, this is (512 + 256)/1024 = 768/1024 = 3/4. If using only one hand (left or right), it would be (16 + 8)/32 = 24/32 = 3/4 also.\n\nThe simplification process can itself be greatly simplified by performing a bit shift operation: all digits to the right of the rightmost raised finger (i.e., all trailing zeros) are discarded and the rightmost raised finger is treated as the ones digit. The digits are added together using their now-shifted values to determine the numerator and the rightmost finger's original value is used to determine the denominator.\n\nFor instance, if the thumb and index finger on the left hand are the only raised digits, the rightmost raised finger (the index finger) becomes \"1\". The thumb, to its immediate left, is now the 2s digit; added together, they equal 3. The index finger's original value (1/4) determines the denominator: the result is 3/4.\n\nCombined integer and fractional values (i.e., rational numbers) can be represented by setting a radix point somewhere between two fingers (for instance, between the left and right pinkies). All digits to the left of the radix point are integers; those to the right are fractional.\n\nDyadic fractions, explained above, unfortunately have limited use in a society based around decimal figures. A simple non-dyadic fraction such as 1/3 can be approximated as 341/1024 (0.3330078125), but the conversion between dyadic and decimal (0.333) or vulgar (1/3) forms is complicated. \n\nInstead, either decimal or vulgar fractions can be represented natively in finger binary. Decimal fractions can be represented by using regular integer binary methods and dividing the result by 10, 100, 1000, or some other power of ten. Numbers between 0 and 102.3, 10.23, 1.023, etc. can be represented this way, in increments of 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, etc.\n\nVulgar fractions can be represented by using one hand to represent the numerator and one hand to represent the denominator; a spectrum of rational numbers can be represented this way, ranging from 1/31 to 31/1 (as well as 0).\n\nIn theory, it is possible to use other positions of the fingers to represent more than two states (0 and 1); for instance, a ternary numeral system (base 3) could be used by having a fully raised finger represent 2, fully lowered represent 0, and \"curled\" (half-lowered) represent 1. This would make it possible to count up to 59,048 (3−1) on two hands. In practice, however, many people will find it difficult to hold all fingers independently (especially the middle and ring fingers) in more than two distinct positions.\n\n\n\n"}

This version provides the premise for the films \"Dead Man on Campus\" and \"The Curve\", as well as episodes of several television series.\n\nIn his book \"Curses! Broiled Again!\", urban legend expert Jan Harold Brunvand investigated the claim that a student whose roommate commits suicide will receive straight As for that semester. He could not find any college or university which actually had such a rule. Sociologist William S. Fox described this legend and variants, such as the rule applying to any death of a roommate; he also concluded that the claim has no basis in fact. The website Snopes rates the story as false.\n\nMany schools and jurisdictions, while not adopting any blanket rule as claimed by the legend, may make allowances or adjustments for individual students in cases of hardship. In the United Kingdom, the Joint Council for Qualifications allows candidates to apply for an adjustment of their score (up to 5%) if they have met all the qualifications for the exam but suffer \"temporary illness, temporary injury or other indisposition at the time of the assessment\". If an eligible candidate dies before completing the examination, an \"honorary certificate\" can be requested.\n\nIn Victoria, Australia, a student takes the GAT midway through the year. If an event happens that affects their performance in the final exams, their results will be derived from their coursework marks and the marks they received on the GAT.\n\nOn 12 November 2019, Hong Kong police raided and destroyed the Chinese University of Hong Kong during midnight. The university management team thus announced a premature end of semester two days later and all students could proceed to the next semester.\n"}

The term MLP is used ambiguously, sometimes loosely to refer to \"any\" feedforward ANN, sometimes strictly to refer to networks composed of multiple layers of perceptrons (with threshold activation); see . Multilayer perceptrons are sometimes colloquially referred to as \"vanilla\" neural networks, especially when they have a single hidden layer.\n\nAn MLP consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. Except for the input nodes, each node is a neuron that uses a nonlinear activation function. MLP utilizes a supervised learning technique called backpropagation for training. Its multiple layers and non-linear activation distinguish MLP from a linear perceptron. It can distinguish data that is not linearly separable.\n\n<section begin=theory />\nIf a multilayer perceptron has a linear activation function in all neurons, that is, a linear function that maps the weighted inputs to the output of each neuron, then linear algebra shows that any number of layers can be reduced to a two-layer input-output model. In MLPs some neurons use a \"nonlinear\" activation function that was developed to model the frequency of action potentials, or firing, of biological neurons.\n\nThe two historically common activation functions are both sigmoids, and are described by\n\nIn recent developments of deep learning the rectifier linear unit (ReLU) is more frequently used as one of the possible ways to overcome the numerical problems related to the sigmoids.\n\nThe first is a hyperbolic tangent that ranges from -1 to 1, while the other is the logistic function, which is similar in shape but ranges from 0 to 1. Here formula_2 is the output of the formula_3th node (neuron) and formula_4 is the weighted sum of the input connections. Alternative activation functions have been proposed, including the rectifier and softplus functions. More specialized activation functions include radial basis functions (used in radial basis networks, another class of supervised neural network models).\n\nThe MLP consists of three or more layers (an input and an output layer with one or more \"hidden layers\") of nonlinearly-activating nodes. Since MLPs are fully connected, each node in one layer connects with a certain weight formula_5 to every node in the following layer.\n\nLearning occurs in the perceptron by changing connection weights after each piece of data is processed, based on the amount of error in the output compared to the expected result. This is an example of supervised learning, and is carried out through backpropagation, a generalization of the least mean squares algorithm in the linear perceptron.\n\nWe can represent the degree of error in an output node formula_6 in the formula_7th data point (training example) by formula_8, where formula_9 is the target value and formula_10 is the value produced by the perceptron. The node weights can then be adjusted based on corrections that minimize the error in the entire output, given by\n\nUsing gradient descent, the change in each weight is\n\nwhere formula_2 is the output of the previous neuron and formula_14 is the \"learning rate\", which is selected to ensure that the weights quickly converge to a response, without oscillations.\n\nThe derivative to be calculated depends on the induced local field formula_15, which itself varies. It is easy to prove that for an output node this derivative can be simplified to\n\nwhere formula_17 is the derivative of the activation function described above, which itself does not vary. The analysis is more difficult for the change in weights to a hidden node, but it can be shown that the relevant derivative is\n\nThis depends on the change in weights of the formula_19th nodes, which represent the output layer. So to change the hidden layer weights, the output layer weights change according to the derivative of the activation function, and so this algorithm represents a backpropagation of the activation function.\n<section end=theory />\n\nThe term \"multilayer perceptron\" does not refer to a single perceptron that has multiple layers. Rather, it contains many perceptrons that are organized into layers. An alternative is \"multilayer perceptron network\". Moreover, MLP \"perceptrons\" are not perceptrons in the strictest possible sense. True perceptrons are formally a special case of artificial neurons that use a threshold activation function such as the Heaviside step function. MLP perceptrons can employ arbitrary activation functions. A true perceptron performs \"binary\" classification, an MLP neuron is free to either perform classification or regression, depending upon its activation function.\n\nThe term \"multilayer perceptron\" later was applied without respect to nature of the nodes/layers, which can be composed of arbitrarily defined artificial neurons, and not perceptrons specifically. This interpretation avoids the loosening of the definition of \"perceptron\" to mean an artificial neuron in general.\n\nMLPs are useful in research for their ability to solve problems stochastically, which often allows approximate solutions for extremely complex problems like fitness approximation.\n\nMLPs are universal function approximators as shown by Cybenko's theorem, so they can be used to create mathematical models by regression analysis. As classification is a particular case of regression when the response variable is categorical, MLPs make good classifier algorithms.\n\nMLPs were a popular machine learning solution in the 1980s, finding applications in diverse fields such as speech recognition, image recognition, and machine translation software, but thereafter faced strong competition from much simpler (and related) support vector machines. Interest in backpropagation networks returned due to the successes of deep learning.\n\n"}
{"id": "2266648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2266648", "title": "Complementary code keying", "text": "Complementary code keying\n\nComplementary code keying (CCK) is a modulation scheme used with wireless networks (WLANs) that employ the IEEE 802.11b specification. In 1999, CCK was adopted to supplement the Barker code in wireless digital networks to achieve data rate higher than 2 Mbit/s at the expense of shorter distance. This is due to the shorter chipping sequence in CCK (8 bits versus 11 bits in Barker code) that means less spreading to obtain higher data rate but more susceptible to narrowband interference resulting in shorter radio transmission range. Beside shorter chipping sequence, CCK also has more chipping sequences to encode more bits (4 chipping sequences at 5.5 Mbit/s and 8 chipping sequences at 11 Mbit/s) increasing the data rate even further. The Barker code, however, only has a single chipping sequence.\n\nThe complementary codes first discussed by Golay were pairs of binary complementary codes and he noted that when the elements of a code of length N were either [-1 or 1] it followed immediately from their definition that the sum of their respective autocorrelation sequences was zero at all points except for the zero shift where it is equal to K*N. (K being the number of code words in the set).\n\nCCK is a variation and improvement on M-ary Orthogonal Keying and uses 'polyphase complementary codes'. They were developed by Lucent Technologies and Harris Semiconductor and were adopted by the 802.11 working group in 1998. CCK is the form of modulation used when 802.11b operates at either 5.5 or 11 Mbit/s. CCK was selected over competing modulation techniques as it used approximately the same bandwidth and could use the same preamble and header as pre-existing 1 and 2 Mbit/s wireless networks and thus facilitated interoperability.\n\nPolyphase complementary codes, first proposed by Sivaswamy, 1978, are codes where each element is a complex number of unit magnitude and arbitrary phase, or more specifically for 802.11b is one of [1,-1, j,-j].\n\nNetworks using the 802.11g specification employ CCK when operating at 802.11b speeds.\n\nThe CCK modulation used by 802.11b transmits data in symbols of eight chips, where each chip is a complex QPSK bit-pair at a chip rate of 11Mchip/s. In 5.5 Mbit/s and 11 Mbit/s modes respectively 4 and 8 bits are modulated onto the eight chips of the symbol c...,c, where\n\nformula_1\n\nand formula_2 are determined by the bits being modulated.\n\nIn other words, the phase change formula_3 is applied to every chip, formula_4 is applied to all even code chips (starting with formula_5), formula_6 is applied to the first two of every four chips, and formula_7 is applied to the first four of the eight chips. Therefore, it can also be viewed as a form of generalized Hadamard transform encoding.\n\n"}
{"id": "2266653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2266653", "title": "Plame affair", "text": "Plame affair\n\nThe Plame affair (also known as the CIA leak scandal and Plamegate) was a political scandal that revolved around journalist Robert Novak's public identification of Valerie Plame as a covert Central Intelligence Agency officer in 2003.\n\nIn 2002, Plame wrote a memo to her superiors in which she expressed hesitation in recommending her husband, former diplomat Joseph C. Wilson, to the CIA for a mission to Niger to investigate claims that Iraq had arranged to purchase and import uranium from the country, but stated that he \"may be in a position to assist\". After President George W. Bush stated that \"Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa\" during the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Wilson published a July 2003 op-ed in \"The New York Times\" stating his doubts during the mission that any such transaction with Iraq had taken place.\n\nA week after Wilson's op-ed was published, Novak published a column which mentioned claims from \"two senior administration officials\" that Plame had been the one to suggest sending her husband. Novak had learned of Plame's employment, which was classified information, from State Department official Richard Armitage. David Corn and others suggested that Armitage and other officials had leaked the information as political retribution for Wilson's article.\n\nThe scandal led to a criminal investigation; no one was charged for the leak itself. Scooter Libby was convicted of lying to investigators. His prison sentence was ultimately commuted by President Bush, and he was pardoned by President Donald Trump in 2018.\n\nIn late February 2002, responding to inquiries from the Vice President's office and the Departments of State and Defense about the allegation that Iraq had a sales agreement to buy uranium in the form of yellowcake from Niger, the Central Intelligence Agency had authorized a trip by Joseph C. Wilson to Niger to investigate the possibility. The former Prime Minister of Niger, Ibrahim Hassane Mayaki, reported to Wilson that he was unaware of any contracts for uranium sales to rogue states, though he was approached by a businessman on behalf of an Iraqi delegation about \"expanding commercial relations\" with Iraq, which Mayaki interpreted to mean uranium sales. Wilson ultimately concluded that there \"was nothing to the story\", and reported his findings in March 2002.\n\nIn his January 28, 2003, State of the Union Address, US President George W. Bush said \"The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.\"\n\nAfter the March 2003 invasion of Iraq, Joseph C. Wilson wrote a series of op-eds questioning the war's factual basis (See \"Bibliography\" in \"The Politics of Truth\"). In one of these op-eds published in \"The New York Times\" on July 6, 2003, Wilson argues that, in the State of the Union Address, President George W. Bush misrepresented intelligence leading up to the invasion and thus misleadingly suggested that the Iraqi government sought uranium to manufacture nuclear weapons.\n\nHowever, an article by journalist Susan Schmidt in \"The Washington Post\" on July 10, 2004, stated that the Iraq Intelligence Commission and the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence at various times concluded that Wilson's claims were incorrect. She reported that the Senate report stated that Wilson's report actually bolstered, rather than debunked, intelligence about purported uranium sales to Iraq. This conclusion has retained considerable currency despite a subsequent correction provided by the Post on the article's website: \"Correction: In some editions of the Post, a July 10 story on a new Senate report on intelligence failures said that former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV told his contacts at the CIA that Iraq had tried to buy 400 tons of uranium from the African nation of Niger in 1998. In fact, it was Iran that was interested in making that purchase.\" Wilson took strong exception to these conclusions in his 2004 memoir \"The Politics of Truth\". The State Department also remained highly skeptical about the Niger claim.\n\nFormer CIA Director George Tenet said \"[while President Bush] had every reason to believe that the text presented to him was sound\", because \"[f]rom what we know now, Agency officials in the end concurred that the text in the speech was factually correct – i.e. that the British government report said that Iraq sought uranium from Africa,\" nevertheless \"[t]hese 16 words should never have been included in the text written for the President.\" With regard to Wilson's findings, Tenet stated: \"Because this report, in our view, did not resolve whether Iraq was or was not seeking uranium from abroad, it was given a normal and wide distribution, but we did not brief it to the President, Vice-President or other senior Administration officials.\"\n\nEight days after Wilson's July 6 op-ed, columnist Robert Novak wrote about Wilson's 2002 trip to Niger and subsequent findings and described Wilson's wife as an \"agency operative\".\n\nIn his column of July 14, 2003, entitled \"Mission to Niger\", Novak states that the choice to use Wilson \"was made routinely at a low level without [CIA] Director George Tenet's knowledge.\" Novak goes on to identify Plame as Wilson's wife:\n\nWilson never worked for the CIA, but his wife, Valerie Plame, is an agency operative on weapons of mass destruction. Two senior administration officials told me that Wilson's wife suggested sending him to Niger to investigate the Italian report. The CIA says its counter-proliferation officials selected Wilson and asked his wife to contact him. \"I will not answer any question about my wife,\" Wilson told me.\n\nNovak has said repeatedly that he was not told, and that he did not know, that Plame was – or had ever been – a NOC, an agent with Non-Official Cover. He has emphatically said that had he understood that she was any sort of secret agent, he would never have named her.\n\nOn July 16, 2003, an article published by David Corn in \"The Nation\" carried this lead: \"Did Bush officials blow the cover of a U.S. intelligence officer working covertly in a field of vital importance to national security — and break the law — in order to strike at a Bush administration critic and intimidate others?\"\n\nIn that article, Corn notes: \"Without acknowledging whether she is a deep-cover CIA employee, Wilson says, 'Naming her this way would have compromised every operation, every relationship, every network with which she had been associated in her entire career. This is the stuff of Kim Philby and Aldrich Ames.'\" Wilson has said: \"I felt that ... however abominable the decision might be, it was rational that if you were an administration and did not want people talking about the intelligence or talking about what underpinned the decision to go to war, you would discourage them by destroying the credibility of the messenger who brought you the message. And this administration apparently decided the way to do that was to leak the name of my wife.\"\n\nIn October 2007, regarding his column \"A White House Smear\", Corn writes:\n\nOn September 16, 2003, the CIA sent a letter to the United States Department of Justice (DoJ), requesting a criminal investigation of the matter. On September 29, 2003, the Department of Justice advised the CIA that it had requested an FBI investigation into the matter.\n\nOn September 30, 2003, President Bush said that if there had been \"a leak\" from his administration about Plame, \"I want to know who it is ... and if the person has violated law, the person will be taken care of.\" Initially, the White House denied that Karl Rove, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff, and Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, Chief of Staff of Vice President Dick Cheney, were involved in the leak.\n\nAttorney General John Ashcroft recused himself from involvement with the investigation because of his close involvement with the White House, and the responsibility for oversight fell to James B. Comey, a former prosecutor who had just been appointed deputy attorney general three weeks previously. Comey then appointed Patrick Fitzgerald to investigate the matter as Special Counsel who convened a grand jury. The CIA leak grand jury investigation did not result in the indictment or conviction of anyone for any crime in connection with the leak itself. However, Libby was indicted on one count of obstruction of justice, one count of perjury, and three counts of making false statements to the grand jury and federal investigators on October 28, 2005. Libby resigned hours after the indictment.\n\nThe federal trial \"United States v. Libby\" began on January 16, 2007. On March 6, 2007, Libby was convicted on four counts, and was acquitted of one count of making false statements. Libby was sentenced to 30 months in prison, a fine of US$250,000, and two years of supervised release after his prison term.\n\nAfter the verdict, Special Counsel Fitzgerald stated that he did not expect anyone else to be charged in the case: \"We're all going back to our day jobs.\" On July 2, 2007, President Bush commuted Libby's jail sentence, effectively erasing the 30 months he was supposed to spend in jail. Libby was pardoned by Donald Trump on Friday, April 13, 2018.\n\nIn March 2008, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) revealed that the investigation had cost $2.58 million. The GAO also reported that \"this matter is now concluded for all practical purposes.\"\n\nAccording to testimony given in the CIA leak grand jury investigation and \"United States v. Libby\", Bush administration officials Richard Armitage, Karl Rove, and Lewis Libby discussed the employment of a then-classified, covert CIA officer, Valerie E. Wilson (also known as Valerie Plame), with members of the press.\n\nThe Wilsons also brought a civil lawsuit against Libby, Dick Cheney, Rove, and Armitage, in \"Wilson v. Cheney\". On July 19, 2007, \"Wilson v. Cheney\" was dismissed in United States District Court for the District of Columbia. On behalf of the Wilsons, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed an appeal of the U.S. District Court's decision the following day.\n\nIn dismissing the civil suit, United States District Judge John D. Bates stated:\n\nThe merits of plaintiffs' claims pose important questions relating to the propriety of actions undertaken by our highest government officials. Defendants' motions, however, raise issues that the Court is obliged to address before it can consider the merits of plaintiffs' claims. As it turns out, the Court will not reach, and therefore expresses no views on, the merits of the constitutional and other tort claims asserted by plaintiffs based on defendants' alleged disclosures because the motions to dismiss will be granted ... The alleged means by which defendants chose to rebut Mr. Wilson's comments and attack his credibility may have been highly unsavory. But there can be no serious dispute that the act of rebutting public criticism, such as that levied by Mr. Wilson against the Bush Administration's handling of prewar foreign intelligence, by speaking with members of the press is within the scope of defendants' duties as high-level Executive Branch officials. Thus, the alleged tortious conduct, namely the disclosure of Mrs. Wilson's status as a covert operative, was incidental to the kind of conduct that defendants were employed to perform.\n\nJudge Bates ruled that the \"plaintiffs have not exhausted their administrative remedies under the Federal Tort Claims Act, which is the proper, and exclusive, avenue for relief on such a claim.\" Bates ruled that the FTCA outlines the appropriate remedy since the FTCA \"accords federal employees absolute immunity from common-law tort claims arising out of acts they undertake in the course of their official duties,\" and the \"plaintiffs have not pled sufficient facts that would rebut the [FTCA] certification filed in this action.\"\n\nThe Wilsons appealed that decision the next day. On August 12, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the District Court's ruling in a 2–1 decision.\n\nThe Wilsons asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear their appeal of the U.S. Court of Appeals ruling. On May 20, 2009, the Justice Department, in a brief filed by Solicitor General Elena Kagan, Assistant Attorney General Tony West, and Justice Department attorneys Mark B. Stern and Charles W. Scarborough, took the position that, \"The decision of the court of appeals is correct and does not conflict with any decision of this Court or any other court of appeals, ... Further review is unwarranted.\" Melanie Sloan, an attorney for the Wilsons and the executive director of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, released a statement that read, \"We are deeply disappointed that the Obama administration has failed to recognize the grievous harm top Bush White House officials inflicted on Joe and Valerie Wilson ... The government's position cannot be reconciled with President Obama's oft-stated commitment to once again make government officials accountable for their actions.\"\n\nAccording to the brief filed by the Justice Department:\n\nOn June 22, 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court announced, without comment, it would not hear an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals ruling. According to a statement issued by CREW, the Supreme Court decision brings \"the case to a close.\" In the statement, Melanie Sloan responded to the ruling:\n\nThe Wilsons and their counsel are disappointed by the Supreme Court's refusal to hear the case, but more significantly, this is a setback for our democracy. This decision means that government officials can abuse their power for political purposes without fear of repercussion. Private citizens like the Wilsons, who see their careers destroyed and their lives placed in jeopardy by administration officials seeking to score political points and silence opposition, have no recourse.\n\nThe Wilsons, and CIA memoranda presented in the report by the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, indicate that Ambassador Wilson's diplomatic experience in Africa, and particularly in Niger, led to his selection for the mission to Niger. He is fluent in French, and, during his diplomatic career prior to the trip, he had served as a U.S. State Department general services officer in Niger, as an ambassador to Gabon and São Tomé and Príncipe, as Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) in both Brazzaville and Iraq (taking over as Chief of Mission during the 1990–91 Gulf War), in other diplomatic postings, and in subsequent national security and military advisory roles concerning U.S.-African affairs under Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton.\n\nAfter being consulted by her superiors at the CIA about whom to send on the mission, Valerie Plame, according to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, suggested that they ask Ambassador Wilson, her husband, whom she had married in 1998, whether or not he might be interested in making such a trip.\n\nIn the book \"Hubris: The Inside Story of Spin, Scandal, and the Selling of the Iraq War\" by Michael Isikoff and David Corn, as Corn observes (before its release on September 8, 2006), they consider the issue of \"whether Valerie Wilson had sent her husband to Niger to check out an intelligence report that Iraq had sought uranium there\", presenting \"new information undermining the charge that she arranged this trip. In an interview with the authors, Douglas Rohn, a State Department officer who wrote a crucial memo related to the trip, acknowledges he may have inadvertently created a misimpression that her involvement was more significant than it had been.\"\n\nIn his testimony to the grand jury, Libby testified that both he and Vice President Cheney believed that Joseph Wilson was qualified for the mission, though they wondered if he would have been selected had his wife not worked at the CIA.\n\nSubsequent press accounts reported that \"White House officials wanted to know how much of a role she had in selecting him for the assignment.\"\n\nIn his book, Tenet writes \"Mid-level officials in [the CIA's Counterproliferation Division (CPD)] decided on their own initiative to [ask Joe Wilson to look into the Niger issue because] he'd helped them on a project once before, and he'd be easy to contact because his wife worked in CPD.\"\n\nIn March 2007, Plame addressed the question while testifying before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform: \"I did not recommend him. I did not suggest him. There was no nepotism involved. I did not have the authority. ... It's been borne out in the testimony during the Libby trial, and I can tell you that it just doesn't square with the facts.\" She described that in February 2002, while discussing an inquiry from the office of Vice President Cheney about the alleged Iraqi uranium purchases, a colleague who knew of her husband's diplomatic background and previous work with the CIA suggested sending him, and that she agreed to facilitate the discussion between her husband and her superiors despite her own ambivalence about the idea.\n\nIn response to Plame's testimony, Republican Senators Kit Bond, Orrin Hatch, Richard Burr submitted additional views to the Senate report that stated \"Mrs. Wilson told the CIA Inspector General that she suggested her husband for the trip, she told our committee staff that she could not remember whether she did or her boss did, and told the House Committee, emphatically, that she did not suggest him.\" Also in the additional views is the full text of an e-mail message sent by Plame on February 12, 2002, to the Directorate of Operations at CPD, in which she writes that Joe Wilson \"may be in a position to assist\" the CIA's inquiries into the Niger reports.\n\nIn a review of Plame's memoir, \"Fair Game\", Alan Cooperman wrote for \"The Washington Post\" that \"by her own account, Valerie Wilson neither came up with the idea [of sending Joe Wilson to Niger] nor approved it. But she did participate in the process and flogged her husband's credentials.\" Plame writes in her book that Joe Wilson was \"too upset to listen\" to her explanations after learning years later about the February 12, 2002 email she had sent up the chain of command outlining his credentials.\n\nIn September 2003, on CNN's \"Crossfire\", Novak asserted: \"Nobody in the Bush administration called me to leak this. There is no great crime here,\" adding that while he learned from two administration officials that Plame was a CIA employee, \"[The CIA] asked me not to use her name, but never indicated it would endanger her or anybody else. According to a confidential source at the CIA, Mrs. Wilson was an analyst, not a spy, not a covert operative and not in charge of undercover operators.\"\n\nIn \"The CIA Leak\", published on October 1, 2003, Novak describes how he had obtained the information for his July 14, 2003, column \"Mission to Niger\":\n\nI was curious why a high-ranking official in President Bill Clinton's National Security Council (NSC) was given this assignment. Wilson had become a vocal opponent of President Bush's policies in Iraq after contributing to Al Gore in the last election cycle and John Kerry in this one. During a long conversation with a senior administration official, I asked why Wilson was assigned the mission to Niger. He said Wilson had been sent by the CIA's counter-proliferation section at the suggestion of one of its employees, his wife. It was an offhand revelation from this official, who is no partisan gunslinger. When I called another official for confirmation, he said: \"Oh, you know about it.\" The published report that somebody in the White House failed to plant this story with six reporters and finally found me as a willing pawn is simply untrue. At the CIA, the official designated to talk to me denied that Wilson's wife had inspired his selection but said she was delegated to request his help. He asked me not to use her name, saying she probably never again will be given a foreign assignment but that exposure of her name might cause \"difficulties\" if she travels abroad. He never suggested to me that Wilson's wife or anybody else would be endangered. If he had, I would not have used her name. I used it in the sixth paragraph of my column because it looked like the missing explanation of an otherwise incredible choice by the CIA for its mission.\n\nIn that column, Novak also claims to have learned Mrs. Wilson's maiden name \"Valerie Plame\" from Joe Wilson's entry in \"Who's Who In America\", though it was her CIA status rather than her maiden name which was a secret. Novak wrote in his column \"It was well known around Washington that Wilson's wife worked for the CIA,\" though that assertion is contradicted by Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald, Valerie Wilson, and the CIA.\n\nAccording to Murray S. Waas in \"The American Prospect\" of February 12, 2004, the CIA source warned Novak several times against the publication: two \"administration officials\" spoke to the FBI and challenged Novak's account about not receiving warnings not to publish Plame's name; according to one of the officials, \"At best, he is parsing words ... At worst, he is lying to his readers and the public. Journalists should not lie, I would think.\" \n\nNovak's critics argue that after decades as a Washington reporter, Novak was well aware of Plame's CIA status due to the wording he used in his column. A search of the \"LexisNexis\" database for the terms \"CIA operative\" and \"agency operative\" showed Novak had accurately used the terms to describe \"covert\" CIA employees, every time they appear in his articles.\n\nOn March 17, 2007, Plame testified before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. She was asked how she learned of Novak's reference to her in his column. Plame told the committee\n\nI found out very early in the morning when my husband came in and dropped the newspaper on the bed and said, 'He did it'. ... We had indications in the week prior that Mr. Novak knew my identity and my true employer. And I of course alerted my superiors at the agency, and I was told, don't worry; we'll take care of it. And it was much to our surprise that we read about this July 14. ... I believe, and this is what I've read, that the then-spokesman, Mr. Harlow, spoke directly with Mr. Novak and said something along the lines of, don't go with this; don't do this. I don't know exactly what he said, but he clearly communicated the message that Mr. Novak should not publish my name.\n\nNovak has written, \"the CIA never warned me that the disclosure of Wilson's wife working at the agency would endanger her or anybody else.\"\n\nAccording to \"The Washington Post\", Harlow conveyed in an interview, \"he warned Novak, in the strongest terms he was permitted to use without revealing classified information, that Wilson's wife had not authorized the mission and that if he did write about it, her name should not be revealed.\" Novak published a column refuting Harlow's claim. In his book, George Tenet wrote\n\nBill [Harlow] struggled to convince Novak that he had been misinformed [about Wilson's wife being responsible for sending her husband to Niger]-and that it would be unwise to report Mrs. Wilson's name. He couldn't tell Novak that Valerie Wilson was undercover. Saying so over an open phone line itself would have been a security breach. Bill danced around the subject and asked Novak not to include her in the story. Several years and many court dates later, we know that the message apparently didn't get through, but Novak never told Bill that he was going to ignore his advice to leave Valerie's name out of his article.\n\nIn a December 2008 interview with the \"National Ledger\", Novak was asked about his role in the Plame affair. Novak replied:\n\nIf you read my book, you find a certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I thought it was an important story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.\n\nOn July 11, 2006, Robert Novak posted a column titled \"My Role in the Valerie Plame Leak Story\": \"Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald has informed my attorneys that, after two and one-half years, his investigation of the CIA leak case concerning matters directly relating to me has been concluded. That frees me to reveal my role in the federal inquiry that, at the request of Fitzgerald, I have kept secret.\" Novak dispels rumors that he asserted his Fifth Amendment right and made a plea bargain, stating: \"I have cooperated in the investigation.\" He continues:\n\nFor nearly the entire time of his investigation, Fitzgerald knew — independent of me — the identity of the sources I used in my column of July 14, 2003. That Fitzgerald did not indict any of these sources may indicate his conclusion that none of them violated the Intelligence Identities Protection Act. ... In my sworn testimony, I said what I have contended in my columns and on television: Joe Wilson's wife's role in instituting her husband's mission was revealed to me in the middle of a long interview with an official who I have previously said was not a political gunslinger. After the federal investigation was announced, he told me through a third party that the disclosure was inadvertent on his part. Following my interview with the \"primary source\", I sought out the second administration official and the CIA spokesman for confirmation. I learned Valerie Plame's name from Joe Wilson's entry in \"Who's Who in America. (Italics added.)\n\nHarlow is the person whom Novak refers to as his \"CIA source\" for his column \"Mission to Niger\".\n\nMichael Isikoff revealed portions of his new book titled \"Hubris: The Inside Story of Spin, Scandal, and the Selling of the Iraq War\", co-authored with David Corn, in the August 28, 2006, issue of \"Newsweek\". Isikoff reports that then Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage had a central role in the Plame affair.\n\nIn their book \"Hubris\", Isikoff and Corn reveal – as both Armitage and syndicated columnist Robert Novak acknowledged publicly later – that Armitage was Novak's \"initial\" and \"primary source\" for Novak's July 2003 column that revealed Plame's identity as a CIA operative and that after Novak revealed his \"primary source\" (Novak's phrase) was a \"senior administration official\" who was \"not a partisan gunslinger\", Armitage phoned Colin Powell that morning and was \"in deep distress\". Reportedly, Armitage told Powell: \"I'm sure [Novak is] talking about me.\" In his \"Newsweek\" article, Isikoff states:\n\nThe next day, a team of FBI agents and Justice prosecutors investigating the leak questioned the deputy secretary. Armitage acknowledged that he had passed along to Novak information contained in a classified State Department memo: that Wilson's wife worked on weapons-of-mass-destruction issues at the CIA ... [William Howard Taft IV, the State Department's legal adviser] felt obligated to inform White House counsel Alberto Gonzales. But Powell and his aides feared the White House would then leak that Armitage had been Novak's source – possibly to embarrass State Department officials who had been unenthusiastic about Bush's Iraq policy. So Taft told Gonzales the bare minimum: that the State Department had passed some information about the case to Justice. He didn't mention Armitage. Taft asked if Gonzales wanted to know the details. The president's lawyer, playing the case by the book, said no, and Taft told him nothing more. Armitage's role thus remained that rarest of Washington phenomena: a hot secret that never leaked.\n\nAccording to Isikoff, as based on his sources, Armitage told Bob Woodward Plame's identity three weeks before talking to Novak, and Armitage himself was aggressively investigated by special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald, but was never charged because Fitzgerald found no evidence that Armitage knew of Plame's covert CIA status when he talked to Novak and Woodward.\n\nIn an August 27, 2006, appearance on \"Meet the Press\", Novak was asked if indeed Armitage was his source of Mrs. Wilson's identity as a CIA operative. Novak responded: \"I told Mr. Isikoff ... that I do not identify my sources on any subject if they're on a confidential basis until they identify themselves ... I'm going to say one thing, though, I haven't said before. And that is that I believe that the time has way passed for my source to identify himself.\"\n\nOn August 30, 2006, \"The New York Times\" reported that the lawyer and other associates of Armitage confirmed he was Novak's \"initial and primary source\" for Plame's identity. \"The New York Times\" also reported\n\nMr. Armitage cooperated voluntarily in the case, never hired a lawyer and testified several times to the grand jury, according to people who are familiar with his role and actions in the case. He turned over his calendars, datebooks and even his wife's computer in the course of the inquiry, those associates said. But Mr. Armitage kept his actions secret, not even telling President Bush because the prosecutor asked him not to divulge it, the people said ... Mr. Armitage had prepared a resignation letter, his associates said. But he stayed on the job because State Department officials advised that his sudden departure could lead to the disclosure of his role in the leak, the people aware of his actions said. ... He resigned in November 2004, but remained a subject of the inquiry until [February 2006] when the prosecutor advised him in a letter that he would not be charged.\n\nIn an interview with CBS News first broadcast on September 7, 2006, Armitage admitted that he was Novak's \"initial\" and \"primary source\" (Novak's words). In the interview, he described his conversation with Novak: \"At the end of a wide-ranging interview he asked me, \"Why did the CIA send Ambassador (Wilson) to Africa?\" I said I didn't know, but that she worked out at the agency, adding it was \"just an offhand question. ... I didn't put any big import on it and I just answered and it was the last question we had.\" After acknowledging that he was indeed Robert Novak's initial and primary source for the column outing Plame, Richard Armitage referred to what has been termed \"a classified State Department memorandum\" which purportedly refers to Valerie Wilson.\n\nWhile the document is \"classified\", Armitage stated, \"it doesn't mean that every sentence in the document is classified. ... I had never seen a covered agent's name in any memo in, I think, 28 years of government. ... I didn't know the woman's name was Plame. I didn't know she was an operative. ... I didn't try to out anybody.\" In a phone interview with \"The Washington Post\", Armitage reiterated his claim, stating that in 40 years of reading classified materials \"I have never seen in a memo ... a covert agent's name.\"\n\nAccording to \"The Washington Post\", Armitage attributed his not being charged in the investigation to his candor in speaking with investigators about his action; he says that he turned over his computers and never hired an attorney: \"'I did not need an attorney to tell me to tell the truth.'\"\n\nNovak disputed Armitage's claim that the disclosure was \"inadvertent\". In a column titled \"The real story behind the Armitage story\", Novak stated:\n\nFirst, Armitage did not, as he now indicates, merely pass on something he had heard and that he 'thought' might be so. Rather, he identified to me the CIA division where Mrs. Wilson worked, and said flatly that she recommended the mission to Niger by her husband, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson. Second, Armitage did not slip me this information as idle chitchat, as he now suggests. He made clear he considered it especially suited for my column ... he noted that the story of Mrs. Wilson's role fit the style of the old Evans-Novak column — implying to me it continued reporting Washington inside information.\n\nNovak also disputes Armitage's claim that he learned he was Novak's \"primary source\" (Novak's phrase) only after reading Novak's October 1 column: \"I believed [Washington lobbyist Kenneth Duberstein, Armitage's close friend and political adviser] contacted me October 1 because of news the weekend of September 27–28 that the Justice Department was investigating the leak.\"\n\nArmitage also acknowledged that he was Woodward's source. At the end of a lengthy interview conducted in the first week of September 2006, he describes his June 2003 conversation with Woodward as an afterthought: \"He said, 'Hey, what's the deal with Wilson?' and I said, 'I think his wife works out there.'\"\n\nIn his memoir, titled \"The Prince of Darkness: 50 Years of Reporting In Washington\", Novak wrote that after Armitage revealed to him that Joe Wilson's wife worked at the CIA, \"Armitage smiled and said: 'That's real Evans and Novak, isn't it?' I believe he meant that was the kind of inside information that my late partner, Rowland Evans, and I had featured in our column for so long. I interpreted that as meaning Armitage expected to see the item published in my column.\"\n\nOn November 11, 2007, Armitage appeared on \"Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer\" and was asked to respond to Valerie Wilson's assertion that Armitage \"did a very foolish thing\" in revealing her identity to Novak. Armitage and Blitzer had the following exchange:\n\nARMITAGE: They're not words on which I disagree. I think it was extraordinarily foolish of me. There was no ill-intent on my part and I had never seen ever, in 43 years of having a security clearance, a covert operative's name in a memo. The only reason I knew a \"Mrs. Wilson\", not \"Mrs. Plame\", worked at the agency was because I saw it in a memo. But I don't disagree with her words to a large measure.<br>\nBLITZER: Normally in memos they don't name covert operatives?<br>\nARMITAGE: I have never seen one named.<br>\nBLITZER: And so you assumed she was, what, just an analyst over at the CIA?<br>\nARMITAGE: Not only assumed it, that's what the message said, that she was publicly chairing a meeting.<br>\nBLITZER: So, when you told Robert Novak that Joe Wilson, the former U.S. ambassador's wife, worked at the CIA, and she was involved somehow in getting him this trip to Africa to look for the enriched uranium, if there were enriched uranium going to Iraq, you simply assumed that she was not a clandestine officer of the CIA.<br>\nARMITAGE: Well, even Mr. Novak has said that he used the word \"operative\" and misused it. No one ever said \"operative.\" And I not only assumed it, as I say, I've never seen a covered agent's name in a memo. However, that doesn't take away from what Mrs. Plame said, it was foolish, yeah. Sure it was.<br>\nBLITZER: So you agree with her on that.<br>\nARMITAGE: Yeah. Absolutely.\n\nIn July 2005, it was revealed that Karl Rove was Novak's second Bush administration source.\n\nIn his grand jury testimony, Rove testified he learned of Plame's CIA affiliation from journalists and not from government officials. Rove testified that Novak called him in July 2003 to discuss a story unrelated to Plame or Wilson. Eventually, according to Rove, Novak told him he planned to report in an upcoming column that Plame worked for the CIA. Rove told the grand jury that by the time Novak had called him, he had already learned of Plame from other reporters, but that he could not recall which reporters had told him. When Novak inquired about Wilson's wife working for the CIA, Rove indicated he had heard something like that, according to the source's recounting of the grand jury testimony for the Associated Press. Rove told the grand jury that three days later, he had a phone conversation with Time magazine reporter Matt Cooper and, in an effort to discredit some of Wilson's allegations, informally told Cooper that he believed Wilson's wife worked for the CIA, though he never used her name. Rove also testified to the grand jury that he had heard from Libby that Plame worked for the CIA. Rove testified that Libby told him that he heard the information from journalists.\n\nThe indictment of Libby states: \"On or about July 10 or July 11, 2003, LIBBY spoke to a senior official in the White House (\"Official A\") who advised LIBBY of a conversation Official A had earlier that week with columnist Robert Novak in which Wilson's wife was discussed as a CIA employee involved in Wilson's trip. LIBBY was advised by Official A that Novak would be writing a story about Wilson's wife.\" Though never confirmed by Fitzgerald, it has been reported that Rove was \"Official A.\"\n\nShortly after the publication of Novak's article, Rove also reportedly called Chris Matthews and told him off the record that \"Wilson's wife is fair game.\"\n\nOn July 2, 2005, Rove's lawyer, Robert Luskin, confirmed that Rove spoke to \"Time\" reporter Matt Cooper \"three or four days\" before Plame's identity was first revealed in print by commentator Robert Novak. Cooper's article in \"Time\", citing unnamed and anonymous \"government officials\", confirmed Plame to be a \"CIA official who monitors the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\" Cooper's article appeared three days after Novak's column was published. Rove's lawyer asserted that Rove \"never knowingly disclosed classified information\" and that \"he did not tell any reporter that Valerie Plame worked for the CIA.\" Luskin also has said that his client did not initiate conversations with reporters about Plame and did not encourage reporters to write about her.\n\nInitially, Rove failed to tell the grand jury about his conversations with Cooper. According to Rove, he only remembered he had spoken to Cooper after discovering a July 11, 2003, White House e-mail that Rove had written to then-deputy National Security advisor Stephen J. Hadley in which Rove said he had spoken to Cooper about the Niger controversy. Luskin also testified before the grand jury. He told prosecutors that \"Time\" reporter Viveca Novak had told him prior to Rove's first grand jury appearance that she had heard from colleagues at \"Time\" that Rove was one of the sources for Cooper's story about Plame. Luskin in turn said that he told Rove about this, though Rove still did not disclose to the grand jury that he had ever spoken to Cooper about Plame. Viveca Novak testified she couldn't recall when she spoke to Luskin. Rove testified a total of five times before the federal grand jury investigating the leak. After Rove's last appearance, Luskin released a statement that read in part: \"In connection with this appearance, the special counsel has advised Mr. Rove that he is not a target of the investigation. Mr. Fitzgerald has affirmed that he has made no decision concerning charges.\"\n\nOn July 11, 2006, Novak confirmed that Rove was his second source for his article that revealed the identity of Plame as a CIA agent, the source who confirmed what Armitage had told him.\n\nOn February 12, 2007, Novak testified in Libby's trial. As Michael J. Sniffen of the Associated Press reports: \"Novak testified he got confirmation from White House political adviser Karl Rove, who replied to him: 'Oh, you've heard that, too.' \"\n\nCourt documents reveal that in December 2004, Fitzgerald was considering pursuing perjury charges against Rove.\n\nOn July 8, 2007, Rove spoke publicly about the investigation at the Aspen Ideas Festival question-and-answer session. Rove told the audience \"My contribution to this was to say to a reporter, which is a lesson about talking to reporters, the words 'I heard that too,' ... Remember, the underlying offense of Armitage talking to Novak was no violation. There was no indictment.\"\n\nOn August 19, 2007, Rove was asked by David Gregory on \"Meet the Press\" about whether Rove considered Plame to be \"fair game\". Rove replied \"No. And you know what? Fair game, that wasn't my phrase. That's a phrase of a journalist. In fact, a colleague of yours.\" Rove has not denied he had a conversation with Matthews. \"Newsweek\" reported in October 2003 that a source familiar with Rove's side of the conversation told \"Newsweek\" that Rove told Matthews it was \"reasonable to discuss who sent [Joe] Wilson to Niger.\"\n\nAfter announcing his resignation from the Bush Administration, Rove appeared on Fox News Sunday and \"Meet the Press\", and discussed his role in the Plame affair. According to Rove, he didn't believe he was a confirming source for Robert Novak and Matt Cooper with regard to Plame. Rove also reiterated that he first learned of Plame from another reporter, though would not disclose which reporter. Rove told Gregory \"I acted in an appropriate manner, made all the appropriate individuals aware of my contact. I met with the FBI right at the beginning of this, told them everything. You're right, the special prosecutor declined to take any action at all. I was never a target.\" Rove told Chris Wallace on \"Fox News Sunday\" \"I didn't know her name, didn't know her status at the CIA.\"\n\nIn his memoir, \"Courage and Consequence\", Rove devotes three chapters to Wilson's \"New York Times\" op-ed and subsequent grand jury investigation. Rove writes that before his third appearance before the grand jury, Robert Luskin went back and looked through all of Rove's saved emails from April through September 2003. Luskin, according to Rove, uncovered an email Rove had written to Steve Hadley in which Rove discussed a conversation he had had with Matt Cooper concerning Wilson's op-ed. Rove writes that while the \"email didn't jog any better recollection of the call\", he immediately told Fitzgerald, after being sworn in, that he wanted to \"set the record straight.\" After presenting the email to Fitzgerald, Rove writes that \"it was as if I'd detonated a bomb in the shabby little room.\" Rove writes that before his fourth appearance before the grand jury he received a \"target warning\" by Fitzgerald. Rove describes his fourth appearance as \"brutal from the first moment\", and that the grand jury \"hung on Fitzgerald's every word.\" After Rove's testimony, Fitzgerald told Luskin \"All things being equal, we are inclined to indict your client.\" According to Rove, Luskin and Fitzgerald meet for hours in Chicago on October 20 to discuss the matter. At some point during the meeting, \"Fitzgerald turned to what was really bothering him: my conversation with Matt Cooper. Was I lying about not being able to recall my phone conversation with him the morning of July 11, 2003?\" Specifically, Rove writes, Fitzgerald wanted to know why \"in December 2003 or January 2004 did I ask my aides ... to find any evidence of contact with Matt Cooper.\" It was at this moment, according to Rove, that Luskin revealed his conversation with Viveca Novak in which Luskin learned that Cooper \"had insisted around \"Time\"s Washington bureau that he had talked to [Rove about Plame].\" Luskin then revealed to Fitzgerald that it was he who instructed Rove to have his aides find any records of that contact. According to Rove, Fitzgerald was \"stunned\", and stated to Luskin, \"You rocked my world.\" Rove writes that it \"was clear Fitzgerald had originally intended to indict Libby and me on the same day.\" Rove also writes that in the end, Luskin had a \"charitable view of Fitzgerald ... the prosecutor never leaked, and he treated Luskin with respect and was forthcoming about his evidence and concerns.\"\n\nThe grand jury Investigation indictment of Libby states:\n\nAccording to Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald, Libby first learned of Valerie Wilson's employment at the CIA in early June 2003 from Vice President Dick Cheney and proceeded to discuss her with six other government officials in the following days and months before disclosing her name to reporters Judith Miller and Matthew Cooper in early July 2003. Fitzgerald asserts that Vice President Cheney told Libby about Mrs. Wilson's CIA employment as the two crafted a response to an inquiry about Wilson's trip from reporter Walter Pincus. While her name was not disclosed to Pincus, Fitzgerald asserts that Pincus's inquiry \"further motivated [Libby] to counter Mr. Wilson's assertions, making it more likely that [Libby's] disclosures to the press concerning Mr. Wilson's wife were not casual disclosures that he had forgotten by the time he was asked about them by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and before the grand jury.\"\n\nLibby does not dispute that he initially heard about Mrs. Wilson from Cheney, but he claims that he had no recollection of that fact when he told the FBI in October 2003 and the grand jury in March 2004 that he remembered first learning about Mrs. Wilson in a conversation with NBC's Tim Russert on July 10, 2003.\n\nLibby told the grand jury \"it seemed to me as if I was learning it for the first time\" when, according to his account, Russert told him about Plame on July 10 or 11, 2003. Only later, when looking at his calendar and notes, Libby said, did he remember that he actually learned the information from Cheney in June 2003. Libby told the grand jury: \"In the course of the document production, the FBI sent us a request for documents, or Justice Department, I'm not sure technically. In the course of that document production I came across the note that is dated on or about June 12, and the note ... shows that I hadn't first learned it from Russert, although that was my memory, I had first learned it when he said it to me.\" The note Libby referred to contains no suggestion that either Cheney or Libby knew at the time of Ms. Wilson's undercover status or that her identity was classified, but they do show that Cheney did know and told Libby that Ms. Wilson was employed by the CIA and that she may have helped arrange her husband's trip.\n\nTestifying as a prosecution witness, Russert said that although he and Libby did indeed speak on July 10, 2003, they never discussed Plame during their conversation. Libby had claimed he had forgotten by the time of the conversation with Russert that he had earlier learned Ms. Plame's job from Cheney around June 12, 2003. Libby also testified to the federal grand jury that when Russert purportedly told him about Plame, he had absolutely no memory of having heard the information earlier from anyone else, including Cheney, and was thus \"taken aback\" when Russert told him. Libby told the FBI that Russert told him on July 10 or 11, 2003, that she worked at the CIA and \"all the reporters knew that.\" In his opening argument, Fitzgerald, referring to Libby's conversation with Russert on July 10, said: \"You can't be startled about something on Thursday [July 10] that you told other people about on Monday [July 7] and Tuesday [July 8].\" Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer testified as a prosecution witness that on July 7, 2003, Libby told Fleischer, \"Ambassador Wilson was sent by his wife. His wife works for the CIA.\" Fleischer testified that Libby referred to Wilson's wife by her maiden name, Valerie Plame, and \"he added it was hush-hush, on the Q.T., and that most people didn't know it.\" Libby was also alleged by prosecutors to have lied to the FBI and a federal grand jury in claiming that when he mentioned Plame's name to two reporters—Matthew Cooper, then of Time magazine, and Judith Miller, then of \"The New York Times\"—he was careful to point out to them he was simply repeating rumors that he had heard from Russert. Cooper and Miller testified that Libby stated no such qualifications to them in telling them about Plame.\n\nDuring Libby's trial, Libby's lawyers argued that Libby's testimony to the grand jury and his interviews with the Federal Bureau of Investigation may have contained inaccuracies but that they were the result of innocent memory lapses explained by his pressing schedule of national security issues. Libby's defense lawyers also challenged the memory and recollections of each prosecution witness.\n\nAccording to press accounts, Cheney told investigators that he had learned of Mrs. Wilson's employment by the CIA and her potential role in her husband being sent to Niger from then-CIA director George Tenet, though it's unclear whether Cheney was made aware of her classified status. Tenet has told investigators that he had no specific recollection of discussing Plame or her role in her husband's trip with Cheney. Tenet did recall, however, that he made inquiries regarding the veracity of the Niger intelligence information as a result of inquires from both Cheney and Libby. According to press accounts, Libby told investigators that on July 12, 2003, while aboard Air Force Two, he and Cheney may have discussed leaking information about Plame to reporters. Libby told investigators he believed at the time that the information about Plame had come from Russert. After arriving back in Washington, according to Cooper's and Miller's testimony at Libby's trial, Libby spoke to both of them by telephone and confirmed to them that Plame worked for the CIA and may have played a role in sending her husband to Niger. FBI agent Deborah Bond testified at Libby's trial that during Libby's second FBI interview in his office on November 23, 2003, Libby was asked about the July 12 flight. Bond testified Libby told the FBI \"there was a discussion whether to report to the press that Wilson's wife worked for the CIA.\" She added that Mr. Libby expressed some doubt, however, adding \"Mr. Libby told us he believed they may have talked about it, but he wasn't sure.\" She testified that Libby did say he had discussed Wilson's wife with Cheney sometime after allegedly discussing her with Russert. Libby reportedly told investigators that neither the president nor the vice president specifically directed him or other administration officials to disclose Plame's CIA employment to the press.\n\nAccording to court documents, by December 2004 Fitzgerald lacked evidence to prove Libby had violated the Intelligence Identities Protection Act and was pursuing charges related to \"perjury, false statements and the improper disclosure of national defense information.\"\n\nDuring Libby's trial, the prosecution focused the jury on a sequence of events occurring between May and July 2003. According to prosecutors, given the level of interest coming from the Vice President's office regarding Joe Wilson, it was impossible for Libby to have forgotten during his FBI interviews and grand jury testimony that he already knew that Wilson's wife worked for the CIA.\n\nOn March 6, 2007, Libby was found guilty on four of the five counts against him.\n\nAfter the verdict was read to the court, Denis Collins, a member of the jury and a journalist who has written for \"The Washington Post\" and other newspapers, spoke to the press. According to Collins, some in the jury felt sympathy for Libby and believed he was only the \"fall guy\". Collins said that \"a number of times\" the jurors asked themselves, \"what is [Libby] doing here? Where is Rove and all these other guys. I'm not saying we didn't think Mr. Libby was guilty of the things we found him guilty of. It seemed like he was, as Mr. Wells [Ted Wells, Libby's attorney] put it, he was the fall guy.\"\n\nAccording to Collins,\n\nWhat we're in court deciding seems to be a level or two down from what, before we went into the jury, we supposed the trial was about, or had been initially about, which was who leaked [Plame's identity]. Some jurors commented at some point: 'I wish we weren't judging Libby. You know, this sucks. We don't like being here.' But that wasn't our choice.\n\nCollins described how after 10 days of deliberations,\n\nWhat we came up with from that was that Libby was told about Mrs. Wilson nine times ... We believed he did have a bad memory, but it seemed very unlikely he would not remember about being told about Mrs. Wilson so many times ... Hard to believe he would remember on Tuesday and forget on Thursday.\n\nCollins told the press \"Well, as I said before, I felt like it was a long, you know, haul to get this jury done. And if Mr. Libby is pardoned, I would have no problem with that.\"\n\nAnother member of the jury, Ann Redington, who broke down and cried as the verdict was being read, also told Chris Matthews, in a March 7, 2007, appearance on \"Hardball\", that she hoped Libby would eventually be pardoned by President Bush; she told Matthews that she believed Libby \"got caught in a difficult situation where he got caught in the initial lie, and it just snowballed\" and added: \"It kind of bothers me that there was this whole big crime being investigated and he got caught up in the investigation as opposed to in the actual crime that was supposedly committed.\"\n\nOn May 25, 2007, in a court filing, Fitzgerald asked Judge Reggie B. Walton to sentence Libby to 30 to 37 months in jail, because Libby had \"expressed no remorse, no acceptance of responsibility and no recognition that there is anything he should have done differently.\" Fitzgerald stated \"Mr. Libby was a high-ranking government official whose falsehoods were central to issues in a significant criminal investigation, it is important that this court impose a sentence that accurately reflects the value the judicial system places on truth-telling in criminal investigations.\" The defense sought leniency based on Libby's record of public service.\n\nThe Probation Office's recommended sentence to Judge Walton was cited in court documents to be no more than 15 to 21 months of incarceration. According to court documents, the Probation Office states its opinion that the more serious sentencing standards should not apply to Libby since \"the criminal offense would have to be established by a preponderance of the evidence, ... [and] the defendant was neither charged nor convicted of any crime involving the leaking of Ms. Plame's 'covert' status.\"\n\nOn June 5, 2007, Libby was sentenced to 30 months in prison, a fine of US$250,000, and two years of probation (supervised release) after the expiration of his prison term. According to \"The Washington Post\", Judge Walton expressed his belief that the trial did not prove Libby knew that Plame worked in an undercover capacity when he disclosed her identity to several reporters. He added, however, that \"anybody at that high-level position had a unique and special obligation before they said anything about anything associated with a national security agency [to] ... make every conceivable effort\" to verify their status before releasing information about them. Walton stated \"While there is no evidence that Mr. Libby knew what the situation was, he surely did not take any efforts to find out, ... I think public officials need to know if they are going to step over the line, there are going to be consequences. ... [What Libby did] causes people to think our government does not work for them.\"\n\nOn July 2, 2007, President Bush commuted the sentence. No pardon was given, and the fine and probation, as well as the felony conviction remain. The statement said:\n\nMr. Libby was sentenced to thirty months of prison, two years of probation, and a $250,000 fine. In making the sentencing decision, the district court rejected the advice of the probation office, which recommended a lesser sentence and the consideration of factors that could have led to a sentence of home confinement or probation. I respect the jury's verdict. But I have concluded that the prison sentence given to Mr. Libby is excessive. Therefore, I am commuting the portion of Mr. Libby's sentence that required him to spend thirty months in prison. My decision to commute his prison sentence leaves in place a harsh punishment for Mr. Libby.\n\nOn July 5, 2007, it was reported that Libby had sent a cashier's check dated July 2 in the amount of $250,400 to the court clerk of the District of Columbia. NBC News reported that Libby paid the fine through his personal funds and not through a defense fund set up in his name.\n\nOn July 12, 2007, President Bush held a press conference and was asked about his commutation of Libby's prison sentence. Bush told reporters:\n\nFirst of all, the Scooter Libby decision was, I thought, a fair and balanced decision. Secondly, I haven't spent a lot of time talking about the testimony that people throughout my administration were forced to give as a result of the special prosecutor. I didn't ask them during the time and I haven't asked them since. I'm aware of the fact that perhaps somebody in the administration did disclose the name of that person, and I've often thought about what would have happened had that person come forth and said, I did it. Would we have had this, you know, endless hours of investigation and a lot of money being spent on this matter? But it's been a tough issue for a lot of people in the White House, and it's run its course and now we're going to move on.\n\nIn December 2007, Libby, through his attorney Theodore Wells, announced he had dropped his appeal of his conviction. A statement released by Wells read \"We remain firmly convinced of Mr. Libby's innocence. However, the realities were, that after five years of government service by Mr. Libby and several years of defending against this case, the burden on Mr. Libby and his young family of continuing to pursue his complete vindication are too great to ask them to bear.\" Wells also stated that an appeal \"would lead only to a retrial, a process that would last even beyond the two years of supervised release, cost millions of dollars more than the fine he has already paid, and entail many more hundreds of hours preparing for an all-consuming appeal and retrial.\"\n\nPress reports indicated that Vice President Cheney \"repeatedly pressed Bush to pardon Libby\" to no avail in the final days of the Bush administration. Cheney told \"The Weekly Standard\", \"[Libby] was the victim of a serious miscarriage of justice, and I strongly believe that he deserved a presidential pardon. Obviously, I disagree with President Bush's decision.\" Cheney was reportedly \"furious\" with Bush over his decision not to pardon Libby.\n\nOn April 13, 2018, President Donald Trump pardoned Scooter Libby, saying, \"I don't know Mr. Libby, but for years, I have heard that he has been treated unfairly ... Hopefully, this full pardon will help rectify a very sad portion of his life.\" In response to news of the pardon, Valerie Plame stated, \"Trump's pardon is not based on the truth,\" and case prosecutor Fitzgerald also said in a statement that Trump's decision to pardon Libby \"purports to be premised on the notion that Libby was an innocent man convicted on the basis of inaccurate testimony caused by the prosecution. That is false.\"\n\nIn January 2007, during the first week of Scooter Libby's trial, it was revealed in court proceedings that former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer was granted immunity from prosecution by Patrick Fitzgerald in February 2004. Fleischer reportedly acknowledged discussing Valerie Plame with reporters, but promised to cooperate with Fitzgerald's investigation only if granted immunity. When the deal was struck, Fleischer told Fitzgerald that he had discussed Plame with David Gregory of NBC News and John Dickerson of \"Time\" in July 2003, days before leaving his job at the White House. Fleischer testified that he first learned about Plame and her CIA affiliation during a July 7, 2003, lunch with Libby. Fleischer also testified that four days later, while aboard Air Force One and during a five-day trip to several African nations, he overheard Dan Bartlett reference Plame. According to Fleischer, Bartlett stated to no one in particular \"His wife sent him ... She works at the CIA.\" Shortly after overhearing Bartlett, Fleischer proceeded to discuss Plame with Gregory and Dickerson. According to Fleischer, neither Gregory nor Dickerson showed much interest in the information. Dickerson has denied Fleischer's account. Gregory has declined to comment on the matter. With regard to the immunity deal, Fitzgerald told the court \"I didn't want to give [Fleischer] immunity. I did so reluctantly.\" Libby's attorney, William Jeffress, sought to learn more about the deal, telling the court \"I'm not sure we're getting the full story here.\" According to Matt Apuzzo of the Associated Press, \"Prosecutors normally insist on an informal account of what a witness will say before agreeing to such a deal. It's known in legal circles as a proffer, and Fitzgerald said [in court] he never got one from Fleischer.\"\n\nIn the closing arguments of Libby's trial, defense lawyer Ted Wells told the jury \"The government in its questioning really tried to put a cloud over Vice President Cheney ... And the clear suggestion by the questions were, well, maybe there was some kind of skullduggery, some kind of scheme between Libby and the vice president going on in private, but that's unfair.\" Patrick Fitzgerald responded to this assertion by telling the jury, \"You know what? [Wells] said something here that we're trying to put a cloud on the vice president. We'll talk straight. There is a cloud over the vice president. He sent Libby off to [meet with former \"New York Times\" reporter] Judith Miller at the St. Regis Hotel. At that meeting, the two-hour meeting, the defendant talked about the wife [Plame]. We didn't put that cloud there. That cloud remains because the defendant obstructed justice and lied about what happened.\"\n\nAt a press conference after the verdict was read, Fitzgerald was asked about his statement to the jury that there is a \"cloud\" over the vice president. Fitzgerald stated:\n\nWhat was said in court was a defense argument made that we put a cloud over the White House, as if, one, we were inventing something or, two, making something up, in order to convince the jury that they ought to convict. And I think in any case where you feel that someone's making an argument that you are inventing something or improperly casting a cloud on someone, you respond. And we responded fairly and honestly by saying there was a cloud there caused by – not caused by us. And by Mr. Libby obstructing justice and lying about what happened, he had failed to remove the cloud. And sometimes when people tell the truth, clouds disappear. And sometimes they don't. But when you don't know what's happening, that's a problem. And so the fact that there was a cloud over anyone was not our doing. It was the facts of the case. It was the facts of the case. It was aggravated by Mr. Libby telling falsehoods. And that's what we said. We're not going to add to that or subtract to that. That's what we said in court, and that's the context in which we said it.\n\nAfter the trial ended, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) attempted to have the transcript of Cheney's interview with the special prosecutor released. The release was opposed by the Bush administration. In July 2009, the Department of Justice filed a motion with United States District Court for the District of Columbia stating that the position of the Obama administration was that the transcript should not be released. In the motion, the DOJ states:\n\nTherefore, if law enforcement interviews of the President, Vice President or other senior White House officials become subject to routine public disclosure, even upon the conclusion of an investigation, there is an increased likelihood that such officials could feel reluctant to participate in voluntary interviews or, if they agree to such voluntary interviews, could decline to answer questions on certain topics.\n\nIn October 2009, the courts ruled in CREW's favor and the US Justice Department was required to release a transcript of Cheney's testimony to the FBI regarding the Plame affair. According to Cheney's testimony, Cheney could not recall information 72 times.\nThis included that Cheney could not remember discussing Valerie Plame with Scooter Libby, although Mr. Libby testified that he remembered discussing Valerie Plame with Cheney on two occasions. Cheney had considerable disdain for the CIA, as he spoke of the incompetence of the organization, and three times said \"amateur hour\" in reference to CIA actions. Some observers say that Cheney's faulty memory was his method to avoid telling the truth, and to avoid potential prosecution. In closing arguments at Libby's trial, special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald said \"a cloud over the vice president, persisted.\"\n\nAccording to the court released transcript:\n\nIn a January 23, 2006, letter to Scooter Libby's defense team, Patrick Fitzgerald states: \"... [W]e advised you during the January 18 conference call that we were not aware of any reporters who knew prior to July 14, 2003, that Valerie Plame, Ambassador Wilson's wife, worked at the CIA, other than: Bob Woodward, Judith Miller, Bob Novak, Walter Pincus and Matthew Cooper.\"\n\nOn November 16, 2005, in an article titled \"Woodward Was Told of Plame More Than Two Years Ago\", published in \"The Washington Post\", Jim VandeHei and Carol D. Leonnig revealed that Bob Woodward was told of Valerie Wilson's CIA affiliation a month before it was reported in Robert Novak's column and before Wilson's July 6, 2003 editorial in \"The New York Times\". At an on-the-record dinner at a Harvard University Institute of Politics forum in December 2005, according to the \"Harvard Crimson\", Woodward discussed the matter with fellow Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein, responding to Bernstein's claim that the release of Plame's identity was a \"calculated leak\" by the Bush administration with \"I know a lot about this, and you're wrong.\" The \"Crimson\" also states that \"when asked at the dinner whether his readers should worry that he has been 'manipulated' by the Bush administration, Woodward replied, 'I think you should worry. I mean, I worry.'\"\n\nAlthough it had been reported in mid-November 2005 that Novak's source was National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley, almost a year later media reports revealed that the source of this information was Richard Armitage, which Armitage himself also confirmed.\n\nOn February 12, 2007, Woodward testified in \"Scooter\" Libby's trial as a defense witness. While on the witness stand, an audiotape was played for the jury that contained the interview between Armitage and Woodward in which Plame was discussed. The following exchange is heard on the tape:\n\n\"The New York Times\" reporter Judith Miller also claims to have learned Plame's CIA affiliation from Scooter Libby. Though she never published an article on the topic, Miller spent twelve weeks in jail when she was found in contempt of court for refusing to divulge the identity of her source to Fitzgerald's grand jury after he subpoenaed her testimony. Miller told the court, before being ordered to jail, \"If journalists cannot be trusted to keep confidences, then journalists cannot function and there cannot be a free press.\" Miller was released from jail on September 29, 2005, after Libby assured her in a telephone call that a waiver he gave prosecutors authorizing them to question reporters about their conversations with him was not coerced. Libby also wrote Miller a letter while she was in jail urging her to cooperate with the special prosecutor. The letter has come under scrutiny, and Fitzgerald asked Miller about it during her grand jury testimony. Fitzgerald attempted to enter the letter into evidence at Libby's trial, arguing it showed Libby tried to influence her prospective testimony to the grand jury. Judge Walton ruled it inadmissible.\n\nMiller testified twice before the grand jury and wrote an account of her testimony for \"The New York Times\".\n\nIn her testimony at Libby's trial, Miller reiterated that she learned of Plame from Libby on June 23, 2003, during an interview at the Old Executive Office Building, and on July 8, 2003, during a breakfast meeting at the St. Regis Hotel in Washington D.C. At the July 8 meeting, which occurred two days after Joe Wilson's op-ed in \"The New York Times\", Libby told the grand jury \"that he was specifically authorized in advance ... to disclose the key judgments of the classified [October 2002] NIE to Miller\" to rebut Wilson's charges. Libby \"further testified that he at first advised the Vice President that he could not have this conversation with reporter Miller because of the classified nature of the NIE\", but testified \"that the Vice President had advised [Libby] that the President had authorized [Libby] to disclose relevant portions of the NIE.\"\n\nMiller was pressed by the defense at Libby's trial about conversations she may have had with other officials regarding the Wilsons. Miller also testified that after her conversation with Libby, she went to \"The New York Times\" managing editor Jill Abramson and suggested the \"Times\" look into Wilson's wife. Abramson, however, testified at the trial that she had \"no recollection of such a conversation.\"\n\nAccording to Denver criminal defense attorney Jeralyn Merritt, a press-accredited blogger who attended the trial, \"After Judith Miller's testimony, Libby lawyer Ted Wells told the judge he would be moving for a judgment of acquittal on a count pertaining to her.\" Neil A. Lewis reported in \"The New York Times\" on February 9, 2007, that \"The Libby defense won a victory of sorts when Judge Reggie B. Walton agreed to exclude part of one of the five felony counts against Mr. Libby. But it remained unclear whether the change, which was not contested by the prosecutors, would matter in jury deliberations,\" and some speculated that Libby's conversation with Miller would be dropped from count 1 of the indictment. At Libby's sentencing hearing, Libby's lawyers filed a response to the Government's sentencing request. Libby's filing read, in part, \"At the close of the government's case, the defense moved to dismiss from the indictment the allegation that Mr. Libby had lied about his July 12 conversation with Ms. Miller, because the evidence did not support this allegation. The government did not oppose this motion, and the Court granted it.\"\n\nAfter the verdict was read, a juror told the press that while Miller's memory may have been bad, many on the jury felt sympathy for her due to the nature of her cross-examination. The juror also stated that Miller was deemed credible during deliberations because she had made notes of her meeting with Libby.\n\nJudith Miller writes that Joe Tate, Libby's lawyer until the criminal trial, revealed to her in a 2014 interview that Fitzgerald had \"twice offered to drop all charges against Libby if his client would 'deliver' Cheney to him.\" According to Miller, Tate stated that Fitzgerald told him, \"unless you can deliver someone higher up-the vice president-I'm going forth with the indictment.\" Miller also writes that Fitzgerald declined to discuss the case with her.\"\n\nOn April 14, 2018, Judith Miller wrote an op-ed for Foxnews.com in which she detailed her reasoning for being \"pleased\" with President Trump's decision to pardon Scooter Libby.\n\nWalter Pincus, a \"Washington Post\" columnist, has reported that he was told in confidence by an unnamed Bush administration official on July 12, 2003, two days before Novak's column appeared, that \"the White House had not paid attention to former Ambassador Joseph Wilson's CIA-sponsored February 2002 trip to Niger because it was set up as a boondoggle by his wife, an analyst with the agency working on weapons of mass destruction.\" Because he did not believe it to be true, Pincus claims, he did not report the story in \"The Washington Post\" until October 12, 2003: \"I wrote my October story because I did not think the person who spoke to me was committing a criminal act, but only practicing damage control by trying to get me to stop writing about Wilson. Because of that article, The Washington Post and I received subpoenas last summer from Patrick J. Fitzgerald.\"\n\nOn February 12, 2007, Pincus testified during Libby's trial that he learned Wilson's wife worked at the CIA from Ari Fleischer. According to Pincus, Fleischer \"suddenly swerved off\" topic during an interview to tell him of her employment. Fleischer, who was called to testify by the prosecution, had earlier testified he told two reporters about Valerie Plame, but on cross-examination testified that he did not recall telling Pincus about Plame.\n\nDays after Novak's initial column appeared, Matthew Cooper of \"Time\" magazine published Plame's name, citing unnamed government officials as sources. In his article, titled \"A War on Wilson?\", Cooper raises the possibility that the White House has \"declared war\" on Wilson for speaking out against the Bush Administration. Cooper initially refused to testify before the grand jury, and was prepared to defy a court order and spend time in jail to protect his sources. At a court hearing, where Cooper was expected to be ordered to jail, Cooper told U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan: \"I am prepared to testify. I will comply. Last night I hugged my son good-bye and told him it might be a long time before I see him again. I went to bed ready to accept the sanctions.\" Cooper explained that before his court appearance, he had received \"in somewhat dramatic fashion\" a direct personal communication from his source freeing him from his commitment to keep the source's identity secret. In an interview with \"National Review\", Robert Luskin, Rove's attorney, stated: \"Cooper's lawyer called us and said, 'Can you confirm that the waiver [Rove originally signed in December 2003 or in January 2004] encompasses Cooper?' I was amazed ... So I said, 'Look, I understand that you want reassurances. If Fitzgerald would like Karl to provide you with some other assurances, we will.'\" Cooper testified before the grand jury and wrote an account of his testimony for \"Time\". Cooper told the grand jury his sources for his article, \"A War on Wilson?\", were Karl Rove and Scooter Libby.\n\nDuring his appearance at Libby's trial, Cooper recounted how he first learned about Valerie Wilson on July 11, 2003, from Rove. Cooper testified that Rove told him to be wary of Joe Wilson's criticisms in \"The New York Times\". \"Don't go too far out on Wilson,\" Cooper recalled Rove saying, adding that Wilson's wife worked at \"the agency.\" Rove reportedly ended the call by saying, \"I've already said too much.\" Cooper testified that when he spoke to Libby, he told Libby that he had heard that Joe Wilson's wife worked at the C.I.A. According to Cooper, Libby responded, \"I heard that too.\" In Libby's grand jury testimony, Libby recalled telling Cooper that he'd heard something to that effect but that he didn't know for sure if it were true. In Libby's trial, Cooper's notes became the subject of intense scrutiny by the defense.\n\nLibby was acquitted on one count involving Cooper. A juror told the press that count three of the indictment came down to Libby's word versus Cooper's word, and thus provided enough reasonable doubt.\n\nAccording to Patrick Fitzgerald and the grand jury Investigation indictment, in his sworn testimony, Libby claimed to have heard of Plame's CIA status from Tim Russert.\n\nBoth Russert and Libby testified that Libby called Russert on July 10, 2003, to complain about the MSNBC program \"Hardball\" and comments that were made on that show about Libby and Cheney with regard to Wilson's Niger trip and subsequent op-ed. Libby contends, however, that at the end of that conversation, Russert asked him: \"Did you know that Ambassador Wilson's wife works at the CIA? All the reporters know it.\"\n\nAt Libby's trial, Russert was questioned by prosecutors for only 12 minutes, but underwent more than five hours of pointed cross-examination over two days from defense attorney Theodore Wells Jr. Russert told prosecutors that he could not have told Libby about Plame because he had not heard of her until she was publicly revealed by Novak on July 14, 2003, four days after Russert spoke with Libby by phone. Wells challenged Russert's memory and his version of the events that led to his crucial grand jury testimony. Wells also questioned Russert about his reaction to the announcement of Libby's grand jury indictment.\n\nWells also focused on a November 24, 2003, report by John C. Eckenrode, the FBI Special Agent who interviewed Russert as part of the DOJ investigation. In that report, Eckenrode writes:\n\nRussert does not recall stating to Libby, in this conversation, anything about the wife of former ambassador Joe Wilson. Although he could not completely rule out the possibility that he had such an exchange, Russert was at a loss to remember it, and moreover, he believes that this would be the type of conversation that he would or should remember. Russert acknowledged that he speaks to many people on a daily basis and it is difficult to reconstruct some specific conversations, particularly one which occurred several months ago.\n\nRussert testified, however, that he does not believe that he said what Eckenrode reports; while he acknowledged on cross examination that he was not asked about any conversations he may have had with David Gregory or Andrea Mitchell regarding Plame during his deposition with Fitzgerald, he also told the jury that \"they never came forward\" to share with him anything they were learning about Joe Wilson or Valerie Plame from administration officials, and he testified that after Novak's column was published, the NBC Washington bureau (which he heads) debated whether pursuing Plame's role in the story would compromise her job at the CIA and ultimately decided to pursue the story.\n\nAccording to multiple news accounts of the trial, Russert's testimony was key to Libby's conviction or acquittal, and on the day that the defense rested, February 14, 2007, the judge refused to allow the defense to call Russert back to the stand. A juror told the press that the members of the jury found Russert to be very credible in his testimony. \"The primary thing that convinced us on most of the counts was the conversation, alleged conversation with Russert,\" the juror told the press.\n\nThere are some major legal issues surrounding the allegations of illegality by administration officials in the CIA leak scandal, including Executive Order 12958, the Intelligence Identities Protection Act, the Espionage Act, Title 18 Section 641, conspiracy to impede or injure officers, the Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement, other laws and precedents, perjury, conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and compelling the media to testify.\n\nA topic of much public debate centered on whether Plame's CIA status fit the definition of \"covert\" outlined under Intelligence Identities Protection Act.\n\nThe government and Libby's defense filed sentencing memoranda after Libby's conviction. According to Fitzgerald:\n\nLibby's defense team countered:\n\nOn March 8, 2007, two days after the verdict in the Libby trial, Congressman Henry Waxman, chair of the U.S. House Committee on Government Reform, announced that his committee would hold hearings and ask Plame to testify on March 16, in an effort by his committee to look into \"whether White House officials followed appropriate procedures for safeguarding Plame's identity.\"\n\nOn March 16, 2007, Valerie E. Wilson testified before the committee. Henry Waxman read a prepared statement that was cleared by CIA director Michael Hayden, which, in part, states:\n\nDuring her employment at the CIA, Ms. Wilson was undercover. Her employment status with the CIA was classified information, prohibited from disclosure under Executive Order 12958. At the time of the publication of Robert Novak's column on July 14, 2003, Ms. Wilson's CIA employment status was covert. This was classified information. Ms. Wilson served in senior management positions at the CIA in which she oversaw the work for other CIA employees and she attained the level of GS-14—Step Six under the federal pay scale. Ms. Wilson worked on some of the most sensitive and highly secretive matters handled by the CIA. Ms. Wilson served at various times overseas for the CIA.\n\nMrs. Wilson's opening statement summarizes her employment with the CIA:\n\nIn the run-up to the war with Iraq, I worked in the Counterproliferation Division of the CIA, still as a covert officer whose affiliation with the CIA was classified. I raced to discover solid intelligence for senior policy makers on Iraq's presumed weapons of mass destruction program. While I helped to manage and run secret worldwide operations against this WMD target from CIA headquarters in Washington, I also traveled to foreign countries on secret missions to find vital intelligence.\"\n\nIn reply to the committee's request that she define the term \"covert\", she replied: \"I'm not a lawyer, but my understanding is that the CIA is taking affirmative steps to ensure that there is no links between the operations officer and the Central Intelligence Agency.\"\n\nWhen asked if she was ever told whether her status fit the definition under the Intelligence Identities Protection Act, Mrs. Wilson replied: \"No,\" adding: \"I'm not a lawyer, but I was covert. I did travel overseas on secret missions within the last five years ... [but] no, no one told me that [I fit the definition under the IIPA].\"\n\nValerie Wilson also told the committee: \"For those of us that were undercover in the CIA, we tended to use 'covert' or 'undercover' interchangeably. I'm not—we typically would not say of ourselves we were in a 'classified' position. You're kind of undercover or overt employees.\"\n\nShe told the committee that she believed that her \"name and identity were carelessly and recklessly abused by senior officials in the White House and State Department.\" She testified that \"I could count on one hand the number of people who knew where my true employer was the day that I was—my name was—and true affiliation was exposed in July 2003.\"\n\nAs a result of her exposure as a CIA operative, Mrs. Wilson testified: \"I could no longer perform the work for which I had been highly trained.\" In reply to a question about whether or not she had any evidence government officials knew she was covert when disclosing her identity to reporters, Mrs. Wilson responded: \"That, I think, is a question better put to the special prosecutor, Congressman.\"\n\nDr. James Knodell, Director of the Office of Security at the White House, testified before the committee as well. He was asked whether the White House conducted any internal investigation, as is required by Executive Order 12958. Knodell said that he had started at the White House in August 2004, a year after the leak, but his records showed no evidence of a probe or report: \"I have no knowledge of any investigation in my office,\" he said. When asked why no internal investigation was conducted or disciplinary actions taken after he took office, Knodell replied \"there was already an outside investigation that was taking place, a criminal investigation. So that's why we took no action.\" In response to Knodell's testimony, Waxman sent a letter to White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolton asking for clarification as to the \"steps that the White House took following the disclosure of Ms. Wilson's identity.\"\n\nAccording to Waxman: \"Mr. Knodell could not explain, however, why the White House did not initiate an investigation after the security breach. It took months before a criminal investigation was initiated, yet according to Mr. Knodell, there was no White House investigation initiated during this period.\"\n\nCiting Executive Order 12958, Waxman observes that the \"White House is required to 'take appropriate and prompt corrective action' whenever there is a release of classified information.\" On September 29, 2003, approximately two and a half months after the disclosure of Plame's identity and subsequent filing of a crimes report by the CIA with the Justice Department, White House press secretary Scott McClellan told reporters: \"The president believes leaking classified information is a very serious matter and it should be pursued to the fullest extent by the appropriate agency and the appropriate agency is the Department of Justice.\" McClellan also stated that the White House would not launch an internal probe and would not ask for an independent investigation into the matter.\n\nAttorneys Mark Zaid and Victoria Toensing also testified before the committee. Each testified that Plame may not have been covert under the IIPA, and that the legal definition is more narrow than the general CIA designation. Zaid told the committee, \"Mrs. Toensing is absolutely correct with many of her questions with respect to the Intelligence Identities Act, which has a very exacting standard. Mrs. Plame, as she indicated, was covert. That's a distinction between possibly under the Intelligence Identities Act, and that classified information was leaked. And the question then is it of a criminal magnitude versus something less than that and these could be any number of penalties.\"\n\nSpecial Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald was also asked to testify. In a letter to Waxman, Fitzgerald responded to Waxman's request, in part stating:\n\nI also do not believe it would be appropriate for me to offer opinions, as your letter suggests the committee may seek, about the ultimate responsibility of senior White House officials for the disclosure of Ms. Wilson's identity, or the sufficiency of the remedial measures that White House officials took after the leak. Prosecutors traditionally refrain from commenting outside of the judicial process on the actions of persons not charged with criminal offenses. Such individuals have significant privacy and due process interests that deserve protection as do the intemal deliberations of prosecutors relating to their conduct.\n\nAccording to Robert Novak, Rep. Peter Hoekstra and Hayden were in a conference together five days after the committee hearing. Novak reported that Hayden \"did not answer whether Plame was covert under the terms of the Intelligence Identities Protection Act\" when pressed by Hoekstra. Novak reported on April 12, 2007 that:\n\nHayden indicated to me he had not authorized Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman to say Plame had been a \"covert\" CIA employee, as he claimed Hayden did, but only that she was \"undercover\"... I obtained Waxman's talking points for the hearing. The draft typed after the Hayden-Waxman conversation said, \"Ms. Wilson had a career as an undercover agent of the CIA.\" This was crossed out, the hand-printed change saying she 'was a covert employee of the CIA' ... Hayden told me that the talking points were edited by a CIA lawyer after conferring with Waxman's staff. \"I am completely comfortable with that,\" the general assured me. He added he now sees no difference between \"covert\" and \"undercover\"... Mark Mansfield, Hayden's public affairs officer, next e-mailed me: \"At CIA, you are either a covert or an overt employee. Ms. Wilson was a covert employee\"... On March 21, Hoekstra again requested that the CIA define Plame's status. A written reply April 5 from Christopher J. Walker, the CIA's director of congressional affairs, said only that 'it is taking longer than expected' to reply because of \"the considerable legal complexity required for this tasking.\"\n\nThere has been debate over what kinds of damage may have resulted from the public disclosure of Valerie Wilson's identity as a CIA operative in Novak's column and its fallout, how far and into what areas of national security and foreign intelligence that damage might extend, particularly vis-à-vis Plame's work with her cover company, Brewster Jennings & Associates. Plame has characterized the damage as \"serious\", noting, \"I can tell you, all the intelligence services in the world that morning were running my name through their databases to see, `Did anyone by this name come in the country? When? Do we know anything about it? Where did she stay? Well, who did she see?'\" In an op-ed published by the \"Los Angeles Times\", Joe Wilson wrote \"She immediately started jotting down a checklist of things she needed to do to limit the damage to people she knew and to projects she was working on.\"\n\nOn October 3, 2004, \"The Washington Post\" quotes a former diplomat predicting immediate damage: \"[E]very foreign intelligence service would run Plame's name through its databases within hours of its publication to determine if she had visited their country and to reconstruct her activities. ... That's why the agency is so sensitive about just publishing her name.\"\n\nIn contrast, in an October 27, 2005, appearance on \"Larry King Live\", Bob Woodward commented: \"They did a damage assessment within the CIA, looking at what this did that [former ambassador] Joe Wilson's wife [Plame] was outed. And turned out it was quite minimal damage. They did not have to pull anyone out undercover abroad. They didn't have to resettle anyone. There was no physical danger to anyone, and there was just some embarrassment.\"\n\nIn an appearance the next night, October 28, 2005, on \"Hardball\", Andrea Mitchell was quoted as saying: \"I happen to have been told that the actual damage assessment as to whether people were put in jeopardy on this case did not indicate that there was real damage in this specific instance.\"\n\nFollowing Mitchell's appearance on \"Hardball\", on October 29, 2005, \"The Washington Post\"s Dafna Linzer reported that no formal damage assessment had yet been conducted by the CIA \"as is routinely done in cases of espionage and after any legal proceedings have been exhausted.\" Linzer writes: \"There is no indication, according to current and former intelligence officials, that the most dire of consequences—the risk of anyone's life—resulted from her outing. But after Plame's name appeared in Robert D. Novak's column, the CIA informed the Justice Department in a simple questionnaire that the damage was serious enough to warrant an investigation, officials said.\"\n\nMark Lowenthal, who retired from a senior management position at the CIA in March 2005, reportedly told Linzer: \"You can only speculate that if she had foreign contacts, those contacts might be nervous and their relationships with her put them at risk. It also makes it harder for other CIA officers to recruit sources.\"\n\nAnother intelligence official who spoke anonymously to Linzer cited the CIA's interest in protecting the agency and its work: \"You'll never get a straight answer [from the Agency] about how valuable she was or how valuable her sources were.\"\n\nOn October 28, 2005, the Office of Special Counsel issued a press release regarding Libby's indictment. The following is stated regarding Plame:\n\nPrior to July 14, 2003, Valerie Wilson's employment status was classified. Prior to that date, her affiliation with the CIA was not common knowledge outside the intelligence community. Disclosure of classified information about an individual's employment by the CIA has the potential to damage the national security in ways that range from preventing that individual's future use in a covert capacity, to compromising intelligence-gathering methods and operations, and endangering the safety of CIA employees and those who deal with them, the indictment states.\n\nIn a November 3, 2005, online live discussion, in response to a question about the Fitzgerald investigation, \"The Washington Post\"s Dana Priest, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist specializing in matters of national security, stated: \"I don't actually think the Plame leak compromised national security, from what I've been able to learn about her position.\"\n\nIn a January 9, 2006, letter addressed to \"Scooter\" Libby's defense team, Patrick Fitzgerald responded to a discovery request by Libby's lawyers for both classified and unclassified documents. In the letter, Fitzgerald writes: \"A formal assessment has not been done of the damage caused by the disclosure of Valerie Wilson's status as a CIA employee, and thus we possess no such document.\" He continues: \"In any event, we would not view an assessment of the damage caused by the disclosure as relevant to the issue of whether or not Mr. Libby intentionally lied when he made the statements and gave the grand jury testimony which the grand jury alleged was false.\"\n\nOn March 16, 2007, Valerie Wilson told the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform: \"But I do know the Agency did a damage assessment. They did not share it with me, but I know that certainly puts the people and the contacts I had all in jeopardy, even if they were completely innocent in nature.\"\n\nDuring Libby's trial, Judge Reggie Walton told the jury: \"No evidence will be presented to you with regard to Valerie Plame Wilson's status. That is because what her actual status was, or whether any damage would result from disclosure of her status, are totally irrelevant to your decision of guilt or innocence. You must not consider these matters in your deliberations or speculate or guess about them.\" During court proceedings, when the jury was not present, Walton told the court: \"I don't know, based on what has been presented to me in this case, what her status was. ... It's totally irrelevant to this case. ... I to this day don't know what her actual status was.\"\n\nLarisa Alexandrovna of The Raw Story reports that three intelligence officials, who spoke under condition of anonymity, told her that\n\nWhile Director of Central Intelligence Porter Goss has not submitted a formal damage assessment to Congressional oversight committees, the CIA's Directorate of Operations did conduct a serious and aggressive investigation.\n\nAccording to her sources, \"the damage assessment ... called a 'counter intelligence assessment to agency operations' was conducted on the orders of the CIA's then-Deputy Director of the Directorate of Operation James Pavitt ... [and showed] 'significant damage to operational equities.'\"\n\nAlexandrovna also reports that while Plame was undercover she was involved in an operation identifying and tracking weapons of mass destruction technology to and from Iran, suggesting that her outing \"significantly hampered the CIA's ability to monitor nuclear proliferation.\" Her sources also stated that the outing of Plame also compromised the identity of other covert operatives who had been working, like Plame, under non-official cover status. These anonymous officials said that in their judgment, the CIA's work on WMDs has been set back \"ten years\" as a result of the compromise.\n\nMSNBC correspondent David Shuster reported on \"Hardball\" later, on May 1, 2006, that MSNBC had learned \"new information\" about the potential consequences of the leaks: \"Intelligence sources say Valerie Wilson was part of an operation three years ago tracking the proliferation of nuclear weapons material into Iran. And the sources allege that when Mrs. Wilson's cover was blown, the Administration's ability to track Iran's nuclear ambitions was damaged as well. The White House considers Iran to be one of America's biggest threats.\"\n\nIn March 2007, Richard Leiby and Walter Pincus reported, in \"The Washington Post\", that Plame's work \"included dealing with personnel as well as issues related to weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and Iran.\" CBS news would later confirm that Plame \"was involved in operations to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons\", and may have been involved in Operation Merlin.\n\nOn September 6, 2006, David Corn published an article for \"The Nation\" titled \"What Valerie Plame Really Did at the CIA\", reporting that Plame was placed in charge of the operations group within the Joint Task Force on Iraq in the spring of 2001 and that, \"when the Novak column ran\", in July 2003: \"Valerie Wilson was in the process of changing her clandestine status from NOC to official cover, as she prepared for a new job in personnel management. Her aim, she told colleagues, was to put in time as an administrator – to rise up a notch or two – and then return to secret operations. But with her cover blown, she could never be undercover again.\n\nAccording to Vicky Ward, in \"Double Exposure\", \"In fact, in the spring [of 2003], Plame was in the process of moving from NOC status to State Department cover. [Joe] Wilson speculates that \"if more people knew than should have, then somebody over at the White House talked earlier than they should have been talking.\"\n\nIn testifying before Congress, Valerie Wilson described the damage done by her exposure in the following way:\n\nIn her memoir, \"\", Valerie Plame Wilson states that after her covert and then-still-classified CIA identity \"Valerie Plame\" appeared in Novak's column in July 2003, she feared for her children's safety but was denied protection by the Agency. On October 26, 2005, her former CIA colleague Larry Johnson told Wolf Blitzer, on the CNN program \"The Situation Room\", that she \"had received death threats overseas from Al-Qaeda\"; according to Johnson, after the FBI contacted her and told her of the threat made by al-Qaeda, she called the CIA and asked for security protection but was told: \"you will have to rely upon 9-1-1.\"\n\nOn November 12, 2010, \"The Washington Post\" published a letter to the editor written by R.E. Pound. According to the \"Post\", Pound served in the CIA from 1976 to 2009. Pound writes, \"I was at one point charged with looking into possible damage in one location caused by Valerie Plame's outing. There was none. ... It was wrong to expose Plame. It was ludicrous for her to claim that the exposure forced an end to her career in intelligence.\"\n\nIn his memoir, \"Company Man: Thirty Years of Controversy and Crisis in the CIA\", John A. Rizzo, a career lawyer at the CIA, details his involvement with the Plame investigation. According to Rizzo, after the CIA assessment of Novak's column, \"the Plame leak appeared to be a most unlikely candidate for a full blown Justice/FBI investigation.\" Rizzo writes that there was \"no evidence that any CIA source or operation-or Plame herself, for that matter-was placed in jeopardy as a result of the 'outing'.\" Rizzo also writes that \"dozens if not hundreds of people knew she was an Agency employee.\" While describing Plame as a \"capable, dedicated officer\", Rizzo lays blame on her husband for the end of her CIA career. Rizzo also writes that it was he who declined Plame's request for round-the-clock security protection. According to Rizzo, there was \"no credible information\" indicating she was in any danger.\n\n"}

The car was very successful in Spain having sold 896,136 units, and was produced in 4-door, 5-door station wagon (\"Familiar\") and 2-door coupé (\"Sport\") ( versions under various engines and trim levels.\n\nThe SEAT 124 model derived from the Italian Fiat 124 car and represented a great step forward for the automotive era in Spain when it was introduced. It aimed at the middle class, as it combined generous offerings and livability but at the same time in an accessible to buy and own package.\n\nDuring its launch time SEAT already sold the SEAT 1500, SEAT 600D and SEAT 850 models, and by the time the 124 model was retired it was succeeded by the SEAT Ritmo, fabricated in Spain from 1979 onwards.\n\nIn 1975 the model underwent a facelift by Giorgetto Giugiaro; the circular front headlights were replaced by rectangular ones and its rear was altered amid several modifications, while the SEAT 124 and SEAT 1430 ranges were unified under a single model officially named SEAT 124D versión 75. In 1976 production of the car was transferred from the Zona Franca to the Landaben plant in Pamplona, newly acquired from Authi, resulting in the elimination of the '124 Familiar' 5-door station wagon versions.\n\nThe four-cylinder twin-barrel carburetted 1197 cc motor originally delivered 60 CV (DIN), however in 1973 a new derivative was implemented with the introduction of the SEAT 124 LS which offered 65 CV (DIN).\n\nThe variants equipped with the Twin Cam motor, victorious for decades in all-type competition, were generally known as FL which had been the internal code name used by the brand.\n\nIts engine soon became famous for its nerve and offered high performance in many circumstances: either as a taxi cab, a police car, an ambulance, a hearse, or even a fire truck. As a race car, it won numerous competitions and trophies driven by pilots like Salvador Cañellas and Antonio Zanini amid others. Modified for this purpose in order to be used in rallies, its engine displacement was raised to reach as much as 2090 cc. In the 1977 Monte Carlo Rally, where Zanini finished third, the 124s were fitted with the same 1.8-liter 16-valve engine as the Fiat 131 Abarths.\n\nMore Sport versions were made with 1600 cc (1970–72), 1800 cc (1972–75) and 2000 cc (1978–79).\n\nIts sibling, the SEAT 1430 also originated from the Fiat 124 range when the latter received several elements borrowed from the higher-class Fiat 125 and gave birth to the Fiat 124 Special edition presented in 1968.\n"}

He also features in \"The Vampire Lestat\", \"The Queen of the Damned\", \"The Tale of the Body Thief\", \"Memnoch the Devil\", \"The Vampire Armand\", \"Merrick\", \"Prince Lestat\" and \"Prince Lestat and the Realms of Atlantis\".\n\nLouis de Pointe du Lac is born in France on October 4, 1766, to a Roman Catholic family who emigrated to North America when he was very young. His mother, sister and brother, Paul, live just outside New Orleans on one of their two indigo plantations, named Pointe du Lac after the family. Louis's brother, who insists that he has religious visions, dies after a terrible quarrel with Louis. Louis blames himself for his brother's death, becoming self-destructive, cynical, and desperate. He longs for the release of death, but lacks the courage to commit suicide. He takes to frequenting taverns and other places of ill repute, instigating fights and duels in order that someone might kill him.\n\nDuring an incident in a tavern, Louis catches the eye of the vampire Lestat de Lioncourt. Lestat appears to Louis as an angel and offers him an alternative to his desperate, meaningless life. Lestat, upon seeing for the first time Louis's \"fine black hair\" and deep green eyes, and sensing his passion, is seduced not only by Louis's beauty, but also by his tragedy and human heart; \"He seduced the tenderness in me.\" Lestat makes Louis into a vampire at the age of 25, his immortal companion in 1791, and lives with Louis for nearly 70 years.\n\nHowever, Lestat is damaged from his experiences in France and the Old World. He is not as gentle a tutor or as much of a friend as Louis would like, one of the central themes in \"Interview with the Vampire\". An example of this is an anguished comment recalled by Louis in his memoir, where he muses: \"I was thinking how sublime friendship between Lestat and me might have been; how few impediments to it there would have been, and how much to be shared.\"\n\nWhile Louis and Lestat are often at odds with one another, they eventually form an uneasy truce, with Lestat coming to regard Louis as a kind of soulmate, albeit one who resists his \"teachings\" on killing and living life as a vampire. There is an element of sexual attraction implicit in their relationship; in the books after \"Interview with the Vampire\", Lestat refers to Louis as his lover.\n\n\"Interview with the Vampire\" details an ersatz familial relationship between Louis, Lestat and a third vampire, Claudia. Louis, in a moment of weakness, feeds from a five-year-old orphan he finds in an abandoned house within the plague-ridden section of New Orleans. Lestat contrives to make her into a vampire to, in his own words, \"bind Louis to [him].\" In giving Louis Claudia to love and look after, he curses Claudia by condemning her to the form of a little girl.\n\nLouis accepts his \"family\", taking the \"maternal\" role with Claudia and finding contentment in their townhouse at Rue Royale. Claudia however, matures psychologically but remains in her child form. After decades of being trapped in the form of a small child, she comes to hate both of her \"parents\" for giving her immortality. She rebels against Lestat, poisoning him and setting their home ablaze with Lestat inside in 1860. She escapes with Louis to eastern Europe to look for other vampires. After years of searching and becoming disillusioned, they travel to Paris.\n\nIn Paris, they find fifteen vampires who have disguised themselves as human actors pretending to be vampires at the Théâtre des Vampires. However, in the eyes of this coven of vampires, Louis and Claudia are criminals. The coven finds out that both attempted to kill their maker Lestat, and believe they ought to pay for their crime with their lives since killing fellow vampires is against the rules of the vampiric lifestyle. Louis escapes death after Lestat pleads for his life. Claudia is exposed to the sun and destroyed.\n\nLouis burns down the Théâtre, killing the vampires there as revenge for Claudia's death and drifts through the world with the Theatre's former leader, Armand, whom he had fallen in love with. They separate in the 1920s in New Orleans.\n\nIn the early 1920s, Louis claims to have discovered Lestat in New Orleans, lost in a catatonic state. Louis turns his back on him in pity and disgust. (This may be a fabrication by Louis to lead Daniel to Lestat's haunt, on which Lestat remarks in his memoir, \"Louis [...] had all but drawn a map and placed an X on the very spot in New Orleans where I slumbered [...] and what his intentions were, were not clear.\" Lestat also mentions, in \"The Tale of the Body Thief\", that Louis \"made up\" this scene. In \"The Vampire Lestat\", Lestat does not mention meeting Louis again in New Orleans before undertaking his long sleep.)\n\nLouis and Lestat are reunited at the end of the novel \"The Vampire Lestat\" in 1985 when Lestat is a rock superstar. In the events of \"The Queen Of The Damned\", Louis and other vampires come together at Maharet's house in the Sonoma Compound to fight against Akasha.\n\nLouis is one of the only vampires to refuse the powerful blood offered by Maharet and Lestat, preferring to gain strength with age. However at the end of \"Merrick\", one of the \"Vampire Chronicles\", Louis puts himself into the sun after making Merrick a vampire. Lestat, David Talbot, and Merrick then give Louis some of their blood (Lestat and David's containing the power of some of the oldest and most powerful vampires in the world) to save Louis's life. It is noted by David Talbot that with this transfusion of blood Louis may have lost some of his humanity and become more vampiric in nature and has become almost equal to Lestat in power.\n\nIn \"Prince Lestat and the Realms of Atlantis\", Louis leaves Armand and his home at Trinity Gate to reunite with Lestat, who has now taken up the role as leader of the vampire tribe. Lestat requests Louis return with him to the chateau in France as his companion and confidante; Louis agrees and becomes consort to Lestat, taking an active role in solving the dilemma the tribe face in that novel.\n\n\nIn Neil Jordan's 1994 film adaptation of \"Interview with the Vampire\", Louis is portrayed by Brad Pitt.\n\nLouis appeared as a character in the short-lived Broadway show \"\" composed by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, and was played by Jim Stanek.\n\n"}
{"id": "2266702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2266702", "title": "Metal ammine complex", "text": "Metal ammine complex\n\nIn coordination chemistry, metal ammine complexes are metal complexes containing at least one ammonia (NH) ligand. \"Ammine\" is spelled this way due to historical reasons; in contrast, alkyl or aryl bearing ligands are spelt with a single \"m\". Almost all metal ions bind ammonia as a ligand, but the most prevalent examples of ammine complexes are for Cr(III), Co(III), Ni(II), Cu(II) as well as several platinum group metals.\n\nAmmine complexes played a major role in the development of coordination chemistry, specifically determination of the stereochemistry and structure. They are easily prepared, and the metal-nitrogen ratio can be determined by elemental analysis. Through studies mainly on the ammine complexes, Alfred Werner developed his Nobel Prize-winning concept of the structure of coordination compounds (see Figure).\n\nOne of the first ammine complexes to be described was Magnus' green salt, which consists of the platinum tetrammine complex [Pt(NH)].\n\nHomoleptic poly(ammine) complexes are known for many of the transition metals. Most often, they have the formula [M(NH)] where n = 2, 3, and even 4 (M = Pt).\nPlatinum group metals form diverse ammine complexes. Pentaamine(dinitrogen)ruthenium(II) and the Creutz–Taube complex are well studied examples or historic significance. The complex \"cis\"-PtCl(NH), under the name Cisplatin, is an important anticancer drug. Pentamminerhodium chloride is the dichloride salt of the dicationic pentammine complex [RhCl(NH)]. This salt is an intermediate in the purification of rhodium from its ores.\nThe ammines of chromium(III) and cobalt(III) are of historic significance. Both families of ammines are relatively inert kinetically, which allows the separation of isomers. For example, tetraamminedichlorochromium(III) chloride, [Cr(NH)Cl]Cl, has two forms - the \"cis\" isomer is violet, while the \"trans\" isomer is green. The trichloride of the hexaammine (hexamminecobalt(III) chloride, [Co(NH)]Cl) exists as only a single isomer. \"Reinecke's salt\" with the formula NH[Cr(NCS)(NH)].HO was first reported in 1863.\n\nZinc(II) forms a colorless tetraammine with the formula [Zn(NH)]. Like most zinc complexes, it has a tetrahedral structure. Hexaamminenickel is violet, and the copper(II) complex is deep blue. The latter is characteristic of the presence of copper(II) in qualitative inorganic analysis.\n\nCopper(I) forms only labile complexes with ammonia, including the trigonal planar [Cu(NH)]. Silver gives the diammine complex [Ag(NH)] with linear coordination geometry. It is this complex that forms when otherwise rather insoluble silver chloride dissolves in aqueous ammonia. The same complex is the active ingredient in Tollen's reagent. Gold(I) chloride forms a compound with six ammonia, but X-ray crystallography reveals that only two ammonia molecules are ligands.\n\nSince ammonia is a stronger ligand in the spectrochemical series than water, metal ammine complexes are stabilized relative to the corresponding aquo complexes. For similar reasons, metal ammine complexes are less strongly oxidizing than are the corresponding aquo complexes. The latter property is illustrated by the stability of [Co(NH)] in aqueous solution and the nonexistence of [Co(HO)] (which would oxidize water).\n\nOnce complexed to a metal ion, ammonia is not basic. This property is illustrated by the stability of some metal ammine complexes in strong acid solutions. When the M-NH bond is weak, the ammine ligand dissociates and protonation ensues. The behavior is illustrated by the non-reaction and reaction with [Co(NH)] and [Ni(NH)], respectively.\n\nThe ammine ligands are more acidic than is ammonia (pK ~ 33). For highly cationic complexes such as [Pt(NH)], the conjugate base can be obtained. The deprotonation of cobalt(III) ammine-halide complexes, e.g. [CoCl(NH)] labilises the Co-Cl bond, according to the Sn1CB mechanism.\n\nMetal ammine complexes find many uses. Cisplatin (PtCl(NH)) is a coordination compound containing two chloro and two ammine ligands. This is a drug used in treating cancer. Many other amine complexes of the platinum group metals have been evaluated for this application.\n\nIn the separation of the individual platinum metals from their ore, several schemes rely on the precipitation of [RhCl(NH)]Cl. In some separation schemes, palladium is purified by manipulating equilibria involving [Pd(NH)]Cl, PdCl(NH), and Pt(NH)[PdCl].\n\nIn the processing of cellulose, the copper ammine complex known as Schweizer's reagent ([Cu(NH)(HO)](OH)) is sometimes used to solubilise the polymer. Schweizer's reagent is prepared by treating an aqueous solutions of copper(II) ions with ammonia. Initially, the light blue hydroxide precipitates only to redissolve upon addition of more ammonia:\n\nSilver diammine fluoride ([Ag(NH)]F) is a topical medicament (drug) used to treat and prevent dental caries (cavities) and relieve dentinal hypersensitivity.\n\n"}
{"id": "2266706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2266706", "title": "Job security", "text": "Job security\n\nJob security is the probability that an individual will keep their job; a job with a high level of security is such that a person with the job would have a small chance of losing it.\n\nBasic economic theory holds that during periods of economic expansion businesses experience increased demand, which in turn necessitates investment in more capital or labor. When businesses are experiencing growth, job confidence and security typically increase. The opposite often holds true during a recession: businesses experience reduced demand and look to downsize their workforces in the short term.\n\nGovernments and individuals are both motivated to achieve higher levels of job security. Governments attempt to do this by passing laws (such as the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964) which make it illegal to fire employees for certain reasons. Individuals can influence their degree of job security by increasing their skills through education and experience, or by moving to a more favorable location. The official unemployment rate and employee confidence indexes are good indicators of job security in particular fields. These statistics are closely watched by economists, government officials, and banks.\n\nUnions also strongly influence job security. Jobs that traditionally have a strong union presence such as many government jobs and jobs in education, healthcare and law enforcement are considered very secure while many non-unionized private sector jobs are generally believed to offer lower job security, although this varies by industry and country.\n\nThis is a list of countries by job security, an important component in measuring quality of life and the well-being of its citizens. It lists OECD countries' workers' chance of losing their job in 2012, with some non-OECD countries also included. Workers facing a high risk of job loss are more vulnerable, especially in countries with smaller social safety nets . This indicator presents the probability to become unemployed, calculated as the number of people who were unemployed in 2012, but were employed in 2011 over the total number of employed in 2011.\n\nWhile all economies are impacted by market forces (which change the supply and demand of labor) the United States is particularly susceptible to these forces due to a long history of fiscal conservatism and minimal government intervention.\n\nMinimal government intervention has helped the United States create an at-will employment system that applies across many industries. Consequently, with limited exceptions, an employee's job security closely follows an employer's demand for their skills. For example, in the aftermath of the dot com boom of 1997-2000, employees in the technology industry experienced a massive drop in job security and confidence. More recently, in 2009 many manufacturing workers experienced a similar drop in job security and confidence. Closely following market forces also means that employment in the United States rebounds when industries adjust to new economic realities. For example, employee confidence and job security in both manufacturing and technology have rebounded substantially.\n\nIn the United States job insecurity is higher for men than women, with workers aged 30–64 experiencing more insecurity when compared with other age groups. Divorced or separated workers, and workers with less than a high school diploma also report higher job insecurity. Overall, workers in the construction industry have the highest rate of job insecurity at 55%.\n\nThe impact of unemployment and job insecurity on both mental and physical health is now the subject of a growing body of research. This will offer insights into why, for example, an increasing number of men in the United States are not returning to work. In 1960, only 5% of men ages 30–35 were unemployed whereas roughly 13% were unemployed in 2006. \"The New York Times\" attributes a large portion of this to blue collar and professional men refusing to work in jobs that they are overqualified for or do not provide adequate benefits in contrast to their previous jobs. It could also be attributed to a mismatch between the skills employees currently have, and the skills employers in traditionally male dominated industries (such as manufacturing) are looking for.\n\nAccording to data from 2014 employee confidence reports, 50% of all current workers 18 and over feel confident in their ability to find a new job if necessary, and 60% are confident in the future of their employer. Job insecurity, defined as being worried about becoming unemployed, is a concern to 25% of U.S. workers.\n\nOverseas outsourcing (sometimes called offshoring) may decrease job security for people in certain occupations such as telemarketers, computer programmers, medical transcriptionists, and bookkeeping clerks. Generally, to outsource work to a different country the job must be quick to learn and the completed work must be transferable with minimal loss of quality.\n\nThe main difference vis-à-vis the United States is the system of indefinite contracts. In most European countries many employees have indefinite contracts which, whilst not guaranteeing a job for life, make it very difficult for the employer to terminate a contract. Employees who have legally acquired these rights, for example because they have been with a company for two years continuously, can only be dismissed for disciplinary reasons (after a number of formal warnings and subject to independent appeal) or in the case of a company undergoing restructuring (subject to generous laws on redundancy payments and often with retraining paid for by the company). In Spain, for example, such employees are entitled to 45 days redundancy pay per year worked. The high cost of redundancy payments is in practice what gives employees job security.\n\nWhilst employees who have such legally binding, indefinite contracts are in the enviable position of knowing that they (and their family) have complete financial security for the rest of their lives, it is important to realise that these obligations work both ways. In some countries such as Germany a company may prevent an employee (whose occupational training they have paid for) from leaving to take up a better post elsewhere until compensation is agreed. Even an employee of a company which is known to be about to fold may find themselves compelled to stay with the company until the end even if they are offered work with a different firm.\n\nEvery company will have a mix of employees on different types of contract. Indefinite contracts can also exist for seasonal work. These so-called discontinuous contracts mean that a hotel, for example, may dismiss its staff in the autumn, but it must take the same people back on again the following spring.\n\nThe proportion of the workforce on indefinite contracts has fallen across Europe in response to increased competition and globalization. Companies may dismiss an employee just before they reach the two-year mark and then re-hire them as a new employee. Many economists argue that greater labour market flexibility is necessary. Economics professors argue that the threat of unemployment is necessary to maintain incentives to high productivity. Meanwhile, John Kenneth Galbraith has argued in \"The Affluent Society\" that some established economics professors simultaneously seek tenure. Jobs that are not backed by an indefinite contract are still poorly regarded in many European societies, often disparagingly described as \"precarious\" or \"McJobs\"—even when the company has good prospects.\n\nIn less regulated European economies, such as the United Kingdom, it is much cheaper to sack permanent employees. In Britain, employees are only entitled to a legal minimum of one week's redundancy pay per year worked (one and a half weeks for workers over 40 years old). Instead, private- and public-sector employees who feel they have been unfairly dismissed have the right to take the company to an Employment Tribunal in order to be re-instated or to obtain extra compensation. It is not necessary to go through the normal court system.\n\nIn Sweden, employment contracts can be time-limited, and can be extended for new time-limited periods, or not, without reason. This is only allowed for the first two years of employment. At expiration the employee will stand without job and without compensation if no extension takes place. Most unemployed people, if they get a job, get a time-limited contract in Sweden.\n\nIn all European Union countries an employee retains their existing contractual rights if their company is taken over under the Acquired Rights Directive (in the UK, known as TUPE) so the years spent working for the old company would count when calculating redundancy payments, etc.\n\n\n"}

The song has been sung and recorded by a number of Newfoundland musicians.\n\nWilliam James Emberley (June 26, 1876 – June 10, 1937) was a Newfoundland and Labrador fisherman who grew up in Bay de Verde, Newfoundland (now Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada), the son of Joseph and Jane (Russell). \n\nDuring the Great Depression of the 1930s, because of the collapse of the international economy, fishermen, including Emberley, were unable to sell their fish; many were reduced to living on the government dole, which was six cents a day. In 1936, Emberly adapted the English song, \"Rigs of the Times\", to reflect the fishermen's plight. He called it \"Hard, Hard Times\". \n\nEmberley's verses reflect a style commonly found in the 18th-century English broadside which made fun of various occupations and made light of difficult circumstances. The song soon became part of the Newfoundland historical tradition. The Emberley version was recorded by Dick Nolan, and was published in Edith Fowke's \"The Penguin Book of Canadian Folk Songs\" (Harmondsworth, England, 1973).\n\nAs \"Hard, Hard Times\" or \"Rigs of the Times\", the song has also been recorded by Shirley Collins, Martin Carthy, Maddy Prior and others. Steeleye Span recorded a related song from England after the Napoleonic Wars: \"Hard Times of Old England\".\n\nCome all you good people I'll sing you a song,<br>\nAbout the poor people, how they get along;<br>\nThey'll start in the Spring, finish up in the Fall,<br>\nAnd when it's all over they got nothin' at all.<br>\nAnd it's hard hard times.\n\nGo out in the mornin', go on if it's still,<br>\nIt's over the side you'll hear the line knell;<br>\nFor out goes the jigger and freezes the cold,<br>\nAnd as for the startings all gone in the hole.<br>\nAnd it's hard hard times.\n\nThe fine side of fishing we'll have by and by,<br>\nThe fine side of fishing we'll have a good buy;<br>\nSeven dollars for large and six-fifty for small,<br>\nTake out your West Indie, you've nothing at all.<br>\nAnd it's hard hard times.\n\nWhen you got some spearin' they're hung out to dry,<br>\nIt'll take all your time to brush off the flies;<br>\nTo keep off the flies it is more than you'll do,<br>\nThen out comes the sun and she all splits in two.<br>\nAnd it's hard hard times.\n\nThen next comes the carpenter to build you a house,<br>\nHe'll build her so snug you'll scarce find a mouse;<br>\nWith holes in the roof and the rain it will pour,<br>\nThe chimney will smoke and it's open the door.<br>\nAnd it's hard hard times.\n\nThen next comes the doctor the worst one of all,<br>\nSaying what is the matter with you all this Fall;<br>\nSays he will cure you of all your disease,<br>\nWhen the money he's got you can die if you please.<br>\nAnd it's hard hard times.\n\nThe best thing to do is to work with a will,<br>\nFor when it's all finished you're hauled on the hill;<br>\nYou're hauled on the hill and put down in the cold,<br>\nAnd when it's all finished you're still in the hole.<br>\nAnd it's hard hard times.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2266821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2266821", "title": "Maniots", "text": "Maniots\n\nThe Maniots or Maniates () are a Greek ethnic group native to the Mani Peninsula, located in western Laconia and eastern Messenia, in the southern Peloponnese, Greece. They were also formerly known as Mainotes and the peninsula as \"Maina\". \n\nManiots are described as descendants of the ancient Dorian population of the Peloponnese and as such related to the ancient Spartans. The terrain is mountainous and inaccessible (until recently many Mani villages could be accessed only by sea), and the regional name \"Mani\" is thought to have meant originally \"dry\" or \"barren\". The name \"Maniot\" is a derivative meaning \"of Mani\". In the early modern period, Maniots had a reputation as fierce and proudly independent warriors, who practiced piracy and fierce blood feuds. For the most part, the Maniots lived in fortified villages (and \"house-towers\") where they defended their lands against the armies of William II Villehardouin and later against those of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe surnames of the Maniots uniformly end in \"eas\" in what is now the Messenian (\"outer\" or northwestern) part of Mani, \"akis\" or \"-akos\" in what is now the Laconian (\"inner\" or southwestern and eastern) part of Mani and the occasional \"-oggonas\" .\n\nHomer's \"Catalogue of Ships\" in the \"Iliad\" mentions the cities of Mani: Messi (Mezapos), Oetylus (Oitylo), Kardamili (or Skardamoula), Gerenia, Teuthrone (Kotronas), and Las (Passavas). Under the Mycenaeans, Mani flourished and a temple dedicated to the Greek god Apollo was built at Cape Tenaron. The temple was of such importance that it rivaled Delphi which was then a temple dedicated to Poseidon. Eventually, the temple of Tenaron was dedicated to Poseidon and the temple at Delphi was dedicated to Apollo. According to other legends, there is a cave near Tenaro that leads to Hades. Mani was also featured in other tales such as when Helen of Troy (Queen of Sparta), and Paris spent their first night together on the island of Cranae, off the coast of Gytheio.\n\nDuring the 12th century BC, the Dorians invaded Laconia. The Dorians settled originally at Sparta, but they soon started to expand their territory and by around 800 BC they had occupied Mani and the rest of Laconia. Mani was given the social caste of Perioeci. During that time, the Phoenicians came to Mani and were thought to have established a colony at Gythion (Roman name: Gythium). This colony collected murex, a sea shell that was used to make purple dye and was plentiful in the Laconian Gulf.\n\nWhile the Spartans ruled Mani, Tenaron became an important gathering place for mercenaries. Gythium became a major port under the Spartans as it was only away from Sparta. In 455 BC, during the First Peloponnesian War, it was besieged and captured by the Athenian admiral Tolmides along with 50 triremes and 4,000 hoplites. The city and the dockyards were rebuilt and by the late Peloponnesian War, Gythium was the main building place for the new Spartan fleet. The Spartan leadership of the Peloponnese lasted until 371 BC, when the Thebans under Epaminondas defeated them at Leuctra. The Thebans began a campaign against Laconia and captured Gythium after a three-day siege. The Thebans only briefly managed to hold Gythium, which was captured by 100 elite warriors posing as athletes.\n\nDuring the Hellenistic period of Greece, Mani remained controlled by the Spartans. The Macedonians under the command of Philip V of Macedon tried to invade Mani and the rest of Laconia (219 BC-218 BC) and unsuccessfully besieged the cities of Gythium, Las and Asine. When Nabis took over the Spartan throne in 207 BC, he implemented some democratic reforms. One of these reforms entailed making Gythium into a major port and naval arsenal. In 195 BC, during the Roman-Spartan War, the Roman Republic and the Achaean League with assistance from a combined Pergamene and Rhodian force captured Gythium after a lengthy siege.\n\nThe allies went on to besiege Sparta and tried to force Nabis to surrender. As part of the terms of the peace treaty, the coastal cities of Mani were forced to become autonomous. The cities formed the Koinon of Free Laconians with Gythium as the capital under the Achaean League's protection. Nabis, not content with losing his land in Mani, built a fleet and strengthened his army and advanced upon Gythium in 192 BC. The Achaean League's army and navy under Philopoemen, tried to relieve the city but the Achaean navy was defeated off Gythium and the army was forced to retreat to Tegea. A Roman fleet under Atilius managed to re-capture Gythium later that year. Nabis was murdered later that year and Sparta was made part of the Achaean League. However, the Spartans, while searching for a port captured Las. The Achaeans responded by seizing Sparta and unsuccessfully forcing their laws on it.\n\nThe Maniots lived in peace until 146 BC when the Achaean League rebelled against Roman dominance, resulting in the Battle of Corinth. The conflict resulted in the destruction of Corinth by the forces of Lucius Mummius Achaicus and the annexation of the Achaean League by the Roman Republic. Even though the Romans conquered the Peloponnese, the Koinon was allowed to retain its independence. The Maniots suffered from pirate raids by Cretans and Cilicians who plundered Mani and pillaged the temple of Poseidon. The Maniots were delivered from the pirates when Pompey the Great defeated them. Most probably in gratitude, the Maniots supplied Pompey with archers in his battles against Julius Caesar during Caesar's civil war (49–45 BC) and were defeated.\n\nDuring the Civil war between Antony and Octavian (32–30 BC), the Maniots and the rest of the Laconians supplied Augustus with troops for his confrontation with Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII of Egypt at the Battle of Actium (September 2, 31 BC) and in gratitude they officially recognized Augustus as Emperor and invited him at Psamathous (near modern Porto Kagio), and their Koinon stayed an independent state. This signified the beginning of the \"Golden Age\" of the Koinon.\n\nContrary to the rest of Greece, Mani flourished under the Romans, because of its respectful obedience to Rome. The Koinon consisted of 24 cities (later 18), of which Gythium remained the most prominent. However, many parts of Mani remained under the also semi-independent (autonomous under Roman sovereignty) Sparta, the most notable being Asine and Kardamyli. Mani became a center for purple dye, which was popular in Rome, as well as being well known for its rose antique marble and porphyry. Las is recorded to have been a comfortable city with Roman baths and a gymnasium.\n\nPausanias has left us a description of Gythium as it existed during the reign of Marcus Aurelius (reigned 161–180). The agora, the Acropolis, the island of Cranae (Marathonisi) where Paris on his way to Troy celebrated his nuptials with Beautiful Helen after taking her from Sparta, the Migonium or precinct of Aphrodite Migonitis (occupied by the modern town), and the hill Larysium (Koumaro) rising above it. Nowadays, the most noteworthy remains of the theatre and the buildings partially submerged by the sea all belong to the Roman period.\n\nThe Koinon remained semi-independent (autonomous under Roman sovereignty) until the provincial reforms of Roman Emperor Diocletian in 297. With the barbarian invasion affecting the Roman Empire, Mani became a haven for refugees. In 375, a massive earthquake in the area took its toll on Gythium, which was severely devastated. Most of the ruins of ancient Gythium are now submerged in the Laconian Gulf.\n\nOn January 17, 395, Theodosius I, who had managed to unite the Roman Empire under his control, died. His eldest son, Arcadius, succeeded him in the Eastern Roman Empire, while his younger son, Honorius, received the Western Roman Empire. The Roman Empire had divided for the last time, and Mani became part of the Eastern or Byzantine Empire. Between 395 and 397, Alaric I and his Visigoths plundered the Peloponnese and destroyed what was left of Gythium. Alaric captured the most famous cities, Corinth, Argos, and Sparta. He was at last defeated by Stilicho and then crossed the Gulf of Corinth towards the north.\n\nIn 468, Gaiseric of the Vandals attempted to conquer Mani with the purpose of using it as a base to raid and then conquer the Peloponnese. Gaiseric tried to land his fleet at Kenipolis (near modern village of Kyparissos in Cape Tenaron), but as his army disembarked, the inhabitants of the town attacked the Vandals and made them retreat after heavy casualties.\n\nDecades later, the famed Byzantine general Belisarius, on the way to his victorious campaign against the Vandals, stopped at Kenipolis to get supplies, honor the Kenipolitans for their victory, and recruit some soldiers. According to Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, the Eurasian Avars (along with the Slavs) attacked and occupied most of the western Peloponnese in 590. However, there is no archaeological evidence for a Slavic (or Avar) penetration of imperial Byzantine territory before the end of the 6th century. Overall, traces of Slavic culture in Greece are very rare.\n\nThere is a description of Mani and its inhabitants in Constantine VII's \"De Administrando Imperio\":\n\nThe area inhabited by the Maniates (or Maniots) was first called by the name 'Maina' and was associated probably with the castle of Tigani (situated in the small peninsula of Tigani in Mezapos bay in northwestern Mani Peninsula). The Maniots at that time were called 'Hellenes'—that is, pagans (see Names of the Greeks)—and were only Christianized fully in the 9th century AD, though some church ruins from the 4th century AD indicate that Christianity was practiced by some Maniots in the region at an earlier time. The Maniots were the last inhabitants of Greece to openly follow the pagan Hellenic religion. This can be explained by the mountainous nature of Mani's terrain, which enabled them to escape the attempts of the Eastern Roman Empire to Christianize Greece by force.\n\nDuring the Fourth Crusade (1201–1204), the Crusaders captured Constantinople. The Eastern Roman Empire was partitioned between several Greek and Latin successor states, notably including (from west to east) the Despotate of Epirus, the Latin Empire, the Empire of Nicaea, and the Empire of Trebizond. These four empires produced rival emperors, struggling for control over each other and the rest of the semi-independent states emerging in the area. William of Champlitte and Geoffrey I Villehardouin defeated the Peloponnesian Greeks at the Battle of the Olive Grove of Koundouros (1205), and the Peloponnese became the Principality of Achaea. In 1210, Mani was given to Baron Jean de Neuilly as Hereditary Marshal, and he built the castle of Passavas on the ruins of Las. The castle occupied a significant position, as it controlled an important pass from Gythium to Oitylo and contained the Maniots.\n\nThe Maniots, however, were not easily contained, and they were not the only threat to the Frankish occupation of the Peloponnese. The Melengi, a Slavic tribe in the Taygetus mountain range, raided Laconia from the west, and the Tsakonians also resisted the Franks. In 1249, the new prince, William II of Villehardouin, acted against the raiders. He used the newly captured fortress of Monemvasia to keep the Tsakonians at bay, and he built the castle at Mystras in the Taygetus mountains overlooking Sparta in order to contain the Melengi. To stop the Maniot raids, he built the castle of Megali Maina, which is most probably Tigani. It is described as \"at a fearful cliff with a headland above\". A Latin bishop was appointed for Mani during the 1250s. In 1259, the bishop was captured during the Battle of Pelagonia by the renewed Byzantine Empire under the leadership of Nicaea.\n\nOn July 25, 1261, the Byzantines under Michael VIII Palaiologos recaptured Constantinople. Prince William was set free, on the condition that he had to surrender the fortresses of Megali Maina, Mystras, Geronthrae and Monemvasia, as well as surrender hostages including Lady Margaret, Baroness of Passavas. With the Franks gone from Laconia, the Maniots lived in peace under the Despotate of Morea, whose successive Despotes governed the province. Mani seems to have been dominated by the Nikliani family, who were refugees. However, the peace was terminated when the Ottoman Turks started their attacks on the Peloponnese.\n\nAfter the Ottoman Empire under Sultan Mehmet II took Constantinople in May 1453, Mani remained under the control of the Despotate of Morea. In May 1460, Mehmet occupied the Peloponnese. The Despotate of Morea had been ruled by the two brothers of Constantine XI, who had died defending Constantinople. However, neither Demetrios Palaiologos nor Thomas Palaiologos chose to follow his example and defend the Peloponnese. Instead, Thomas fled to Italy, while Demetrios sought refuge with Mehmet. Helena Palaiologina, a daughter of Demetrios and his second wife Theodora Asanina, was given in marriage to Mehmet II.\n\nKrokodeilos Kladas, a Greek from Laconia, was granted lordship by Mehmet over Elos and Vardounia in 1461. Mehmet hoped that Kladas would defend Laconia from the Maniots. During that time, Mani's population grew as a result of an influx of refugees who came from other areas of Greece. In 1463, Kladas joined the Venetians in their ongoing war against the Ottomans. He led the Maniots against the Ottomans with Venetian aid until 1479, when the Venetians made peace with the Ottomans and gave the Ottomans the right to rule the \"Brazzo di Maina\". Kladas refused to accept the conditions, and so the Venetians put a price on his head.\n\nAfter the end of the Turko-Venetian War, the Venetians left the Maniots to fend for themselves. Many of the Greeks who had revolted alongside the Venetians were massacred by the Ottomans, but many of them fled to find refuge in Mani. The Maniots continued to resist, and Mehmet sent an army of 2,000 infantry and 300 cavalry against Mani under the command of Ale Boumico. The Venetians, trying to gain favor with the Porte, handed over some Maniot rebels. The Ottomans reached Oitylo before Kladas, and the Maniots attacked and massacred them. Only a few escaped; amongst them was Ale Boumico. Kladas invaded the Laconian plain with 14,000 Maniots and killed the Turkish inhabitants.\n\nA month later, a larger force under the command of Ahmed Bey invaded Mani and drove Kladas to Porto Kagio. There, he was picked up by three galleys of King Ferdinand I of Naples. To delay the Turks long enough for Kladas to escape, the Maniot rear guard attacked the Turkish army. Kladas reached the Kingdom of Naples, whence he became a mercenary leader. He returned to Mani in 1490 and was killed in a battle at Monemvasia.\n\nFrom 1500 to 1570, Mani kept its autonomy without any invasion from the Ottomans. The Ottomans were busy driving the Venetians out of the Peloponnese and succeeded in 1540, when they conquered Monemvasia and Nafplio. The Ottomans under Selim II, preparing to invade the Venetian island of Cyprus, built a fortress in Mani, at Porto Kagio, and they also garrisoned Passavas. The aim of this was to disrupt the Venetians' communication lines and to keep the Maniots at bay. Alarmed, the Maniots called upon Venetian assistance, and the Venetian navy in combination with the Maniot army captured the castle.\n\nCyprus fell later that year, but the fleet of the Holy League defeated the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto (1571). The Greeks assumed that John of Austria would champion their revolt under the command of the bishop of Monemvasia. The promised army never arrived, and by 1572 the bishop was forced to retreat to Mani. The Maniots did not succeed when they appealed to Pope Gregory VIII to convince Philip II of Spain to provide military support.\n\nIn 1603, the Maniots approached Pope Clement VIII, who had recently taken up the cross. Clement died two years later, and the Maniots began to seek a new champion, centering their attention on the King of Spain, Philip III. They urged him to land his army at Porto Kagio and promised to join him with 15,000 armed men as well as 80,000 other Peloponnesians. The Maniots also sent envoys to some major powers of the Mediterranean, as for example the Republic of Venice, the Kingdom of France, the Republic of Genoa, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and once again Spain. These states were interested and sent several expeditionary forces to Mani, but with the exception of a Spanish expedition that sacked Passavas, they all failed to achieve anything.\n\nThe Maniots found a champion in 1612, Charles Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua and Nevers. Charles was a descendant of the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos through his grandmother, who was of the line of Theodore I of Montferrat, Andronikos' son. Through this connection he claimed the throne of Constantinople. He began plotting with the Maniots, who addressed him as \"King Constantine Palaiologos\". When the Porte heard about this, they sent Arslan in command of an army of 20,000 men and 70 ships to invade Mani. He succeeded in ravaging Mani and imposing taxes on the Maniots (which they did not pay). This caused Nevers to move more actively for his crusade. Nevers sent envoys to the courts of Europe looking for support. In 1619, he recruited six ships and a number of men, but he was forced to abort the mission because of the beginning of the Thirty Years' War. The idea of the crusade faded and Nevers died in 1637.\n\nIn 1645, a new Turkish-Venetian War, the so-called \"Cretan War\" began, during which the Republic of Venice was attempting to defend Crete, one of their provinces since 1204, from the Ottoman Empire, initially under Ibrahim I. The Maniots supported the Venetians by offering them ships. In 1659, Admiral Francesco Morosini, with 13,000 Maniots as his allies, occupied Kalamata, a large city near Mani. In 1667, during the Siege of Candia, some Maniot pirate ships sneaked into the Ottoman fleet and managed to loot and burn some ships. However, Candia fell in 1669, and Crete became part of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nWith Crete captured, the Ottomans turned their attention to Mani. The Grand Vizier, Köprülü Fazıl Ahmet Pasha, sent the pirate Hasan Baba to subdue Mani. Baba arrived in Mani demanding that the Maniots surrender hostages, but instead he was answered with bullets. During the night, ten Maniots went and cut the hawsers of Hasan's ships. This caused some of Baba's ships to founder on some rocks, and the Maniots, taking advantage of the situation, attacked and killed the Turks and seized the ships. Baba managed to escape with only one ship.\nIn the Bagnio of Constantinople, there was a notorious twenty-five-year-old Maniot pirate named Limberakis Gerakaris. At the age of fifteen, he was in the Venetian galleys as a rower. After being released by the Venetians, he continued piracy and was captured by the Turks in 1667. The Grand Vizier decided to give him amnesty if he cooperated with the Turks and helped them conquer Mani. Gerakaris agreed and in 1670 became the bey of Mani. One of Gerakis' first acts was to exile his clan's enemies, the Iatriani family and the Stephanopoulos family from Oitylo. The Iatriani fled in 1670 and settled in Livorno, Tuscany. The Stephanopoulos clan was forced to leave Oitylo in 1676, and after having gained permission from the Republic of Genoa, went to Corsica. The Stephanopoulos family first lived in the town of Paomia before moving to Cargese, and to this day consider themselves Greeks.\nLimberakis soon fell out of favor with the Turks since he joined his fellow Maniots in piracy and was captured in 1682. With Ottoman forces preoccupied with the Austrians, the Venetians under Morosini saw their opportunity to take over Turkish-held territories in the Peloponnese, beginning the Morean War. The Turkish general in the Peloponnese, Ismael, discovered this plan and attacked Mani with 10,000 men. The Turks ravaged the plains, but during the night the Maniots attacked and killed 1,800 Turks. The other Turks retreated to the castles of Kelefa and Zarnatas, where they were besieged by the Maniots. After brief sieges, the Maniots managed to capture both Koroni and Kelefa. However, Ismael returned with 10,000 infantry and 2,500 artillery and started besieging the Maniots at Kelefa. The Turks nearly succeeded in breaching the walls before 4,500 Venetians under the command of Morosini arrived and forced the Turks to retreat to Kastania with the Maniots in pursuit.\n\nThe Venetians, with assistance of the Greeks, conquered the rest of the Peloponnese and then besieged Athens. During the siege of Athens, the Ottomans used the Parthenon as an ammunition depot. When artillery fire from the Venetians struck the depot, the resulting explosion damaged large portions of the Parthenon. The desperate Ottomans freed Limberakis and gave him the title \"His Highness, the Ruler of Mani\". Limberakis immediately launched several raids into Venetian-held territories of the Peloponnese. However, when the Ottomans attempted to poison Limberakis, he defected to the Venetian side. The Venetians made Limberakis a Knight of St. Mark and recognized him as ruler of Roumeli. Limberakis first attacked the city of Arta, when the Ottomans destroyed his estates at Karpenisi. He captured and plundered the city before going back to Mani. The Arteans sent a committee to Venice and reported everything to the Doge. Ultimately, Limberakis moved to Italy where he died fourteen years later.\n\nIn 1715, the Ottomans attacked the Peloponnese and managed to drive out the Venetians within seventy days. The Venetians won some minor naval battles off Mani but abandoned the Peloponnese in 1715. The next year, the Treaty of Passarowitz was signed, and the Venetians abandoned their claim to the Peloponnese.\n\nGeorgios Papazolis, a Greek officer of the Russian army, was a friend of the Orlovs and had them convince Catherine the Great to send an army to Mani and liberate Greece. A Russian fleet of five ships and 500 soldiers under the command of Aleksey Grigoryevich Orlov sailed from the Baltic Sea in 1769 and reached Mani in 1770. The fleet landed at Oitylo, where it was met by the Maniots. It was decided to divide the army into two groups, the \"Western Legion\" and the \"Eastern Legion\". The Eastern Legion, under the command of Barkof, Grigorakis, and Psaros, consisted of 500 Maniots and 6 Russians. The Western Legion, under the command of John Mavromichalis (nicknamed \"The Dog\"), Piotr Dolgorukov, and Panagiotis Koumoundouros, consisted of 200 Maniots and 12 Russians.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian fleet was besieging Koroni with assistance from the Western Legion. The siege proved to be difficult, and soon Orlov got into a dispute with John the Dog. Mavromichalis stated to Orlov that if they wanted to start a real war, they had to occupy Koroni, and that if they did not, they should not excite the Greeks in vain. Orlov replied by calling the Maniots \"ragged\" and \"rude booty men\". To this, Mavromichalis replied, \"The last of these ragged booty men keeps his freedom with his own sword and deserves more than you, slave of a whore!\" The Russians left and conducted their own operations until the end of the year, when they ultimately sailed back to Russia.\n\nThe Eastern Legion met with success when it defeated an army of 3,500 Turks. The Ottomans responded to this by sending an army of 8,000 to invade the Peloponnese. The Ottoman army first plundered Attica before entering the Peloponnese. At Rizomylos in Messenia, they were blocked by John Mavromichalis and 400 of his followers. The Maniots held them off for a while, but the Ottoman forces eventually did not lose due to their superior numbers. They captured John Mavromichalis, who was not only seriously wounded but also the last survivor of the battle. He was ultimately tortured to death. They then invaded Mani and began ravaging the land near Almiros (near the modern village of Kyparissos). During the night, an army of 5,000 Maniot men and women attacked the enemy camp. The Ottoman forces lost 1,700, while the Maniots only suffered thirty-nine casualties.\n\nAround 1770, the Ottoman commander Hasan Ghazi with 16,000 men besieged the two fighting towers (pyrgoi) of Venetsanakis clan in Kastania. The defenders were Constantine Kolokotronis and Panagiotis Venetsanakis with 150 men and women. The fight lasted for twelve days: most of the defenders were killed, and all prisoners of war were tortured and dismembered. The wife of Constantine Kolokotronis was dressed like a warrior and fought her way out carrying her baby, Theodoros Kolokotronis, the future commander of the Greek War of Independence.\nFrom Kastania, Hasan Ghazi advanced towards Skoutari and laid siege to the tower of the powerful Grigorakis clan. The tower contained fifteen men, who held out for three days until the Turks undermined the tower, placed gunpowder, and blew up the entire garrison. By this time, the main Maniot army of 5,000 men and 2,000 women had established a defensive position which was on mountainous terrain above the town of Parasyros. The entire army was under the command of Exarchos Grigorakis and his nephew Zanetos Grigorakis. The Ottoman army advanced to the plain of Agio Pigada (meaning \"Holy Well\"). They sent envoys to the Maniots telling them that Hasan wanted to negotiate. The Maniots knew that if they sent envoys to the Turks, they would be executed by Hasan if the negotiations failed. However, the Maniots sent six men to discuss the terms.\n\nSix Maniot envoys were sent to Hasan and, without bowing, asked him what he wanted. Hasan's demands entailed the children of ten captains as hostages, all Maniot-held arms, and an annual head-tax to be paid as punishment for supporting the Russians. The Maniots answered Hasan's demands saying, \"We prefer to die rather than give to you our guns and children. We don't pay taxes, because our land is poor.\" Hasan became furious and had the six men decapitated and impaled on stakes so that the Maniots could see them.\n\nAfter the envoys were killed, the remaining Maniots attacked the Ottomans. The fighting was fierce, and only 6,000 Turks managed to reach Mystras. No one knew exactly how many casualties the Maniots suffered, but the Turks definitively lost 10,000 men. In 1780, Hasan Ghazi, the Bey of the Peloponnese, tried to weaken the Grigorakis family by arranging the assassination of Exarchos Grigorakis. He invited him to Tripolitsa and treated him as an honored guest but then had him hanged. On Easter Sunday, Exarchos' mother incited the men of Skoutari to take revenge for the death of her son. Commanded by Zanetos Grigorakis, the men of Skoutari dressed as priests and were allowed into Passavas. Once inside, the Skoutariotes took out their concealed weapons and killed all the inhabitants of Passavas.\n\nIn 1782, the Ottomans lured Michalis Troupakis, Bey of Mani, onto a ship and sent him to Lesbos, where he was executed for piracy. The Porte tried to get Zanetos Grigorakis to replace him, but Zanetos refused until he was lured onto a ship and forced to become bey.\n\nSoon after the Orlov Expedition, a number of Maniots entered Russian military service. Remnants of the two legions joined Russian sea forces as marines, participating in operations in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean. Two leaders of these volunteers, Stephanos Mavromichalis and Dimitrios Grigorakis, were scions of the main Maniot clans, each rising to the rank of major.\n\nDuring Zanetos' rule, Mani became a base for many klephts and other Greek bandits. Among them was the famous Greek pirate and officer of the Russian army, Lambros Katsonis, who helped the Russians with their wars against the Ottomans, Andreas Androutsos (father of Odysseas), and Zacharias Barbitsiotis. On January 9, 1792, Catherine II of Russia had her representative Alexander Bezborodko sign the Treaty of Jassy with Grand Vizier Koca Yusuf Pasha of the Ottoman Empire. The treaty ended the Russo-Turkish War, recognized Russia's 1783 annexation of the Crimean Khanate, and transferred Yedisan to Russia, making the Dniester the Russo-Turkish frontier in Europe while leaving the Asiatic frontier (Kuban River) unchanged. Lambros Katsonis said: \"Aikaterini (Greek: Catherine) made her treaty, but Katsonis didn't make his treaty with the enemy.\"\n\nKatsonis, together with Androutsos and Barbitsiotis, built a gun battery at Porto Kagio. He gathered a small army and a navy of eleven ships and attacked Ottoman ships in the area. However, not being able to maintain his ships, he started attacking ships from other countries. Later that year, he sank two French ships, which was the beginning of the end for Katsonis. An Ottoman fleet of thirty ships and a French destroyer attacked Katsonis at Porto Kagio. Katsonis' men fled to land; Katsonis himself escaped to Odessa on one of the ships.\n\nAndroutsos with 500 men tried to cross the Peloponnese and enter Roumelia. Barbitsiotis in a rear-guard action managed to help fight his way through the Peloponnese and into Roumelia. In 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte, at the time a general serving in the French Revolutionary Wars under the orders of the French Directory, sent two members of the Stephanopoulos family to Mani in order to convince the Maniots to attack the Ottomans from the Peloponnese while he attacked from Egypt. Zacharias Barbitsiotis and Zanetbey (Zanetos Grigorakis) accepted the offer, and Napoleon sent them weapons. When the Turks discovered this, they had Zanetos replaced as bey with Panagiotis Koumoundouros.\n\nDuring 1803, the Ottomans deposed Panagiotis Koumoundouros, because he was not capable of subduing Zanetos Grigorakis, who was still receiving weapons from the French at his castle at Cranae. The Ottomans replaced him with Antony Grigorakis or Antonbey, cousin of Zanetos. The Turkish fleet under the command of the admiral Seremet, was unable to capture Cranae and was soon forced to retreat.\n\nIn 1805, Seremet attacked Zacharias Barbitsiotis at his fortress in the Taygetus mountains and managed to kill him. In 1807, the Ottomans attacked Antonbey at Gytheio, because he was unwilling to suppress his cousin, who was still attacking the Turks. The Turks were once again forced to retreat. Three years later, Antonbey resigned in favor of his son-in-law, Konstantis Zervakos, who was favorable to the bey of the Peloponnese. However, the Maniots did not agree with the choice and deposed Zervakos.\n\nLater that year, the Maniot leaders gathered at Gytheio and elected Theodoros Zanerakos or Theodorobey, nephew of Zanetos Grigorakis, as Bey of Mani. During 1815, the Ottomans attacked Mani but were driven back. Theodorobey was removed from power later that year and was replaced by Petros Mavromichalis or Petrobey.\n\nPierros Grigorakis, a son of Zanetos, entered Russian service on Zante and commanded a force of some 500 Maniots known as the Spartan Legion. This was part of the Legion of Light Riflemen, a force made up of mainland refugees that defended the Ionian Islands and participated in Russian operations in the Mediterranean in the years 1805–1807. Many veterans of this unit later joined the secret society Filiki Eteria (\"Friendly Company\") and participated with the Greek Revolution, including Elias Chrisospathis, who initiated the Maniots into the secret society, as well as Pierros and his brothers Giorgos and Zanetakos.\n\nPetros Mavromichalis was John the Dog's nephew. He was the first Maniot bey from Mesa Mani (Inner Mani). In 1798, he had also been approached by Napoleon to join the war on the Ottomans, but after the failure of the French invasion of Egypt, Petros joined the French army only for a while and fought in the Ionian Islands. It was rumored at the time that he was appointed bey only because his uncle was not killed, had converted to Islam, and had become an officer in the Ottoman army.\nIn 1819, he joined the Filiki Eteria, which by 1821 was prepared to revolt.\n\nManiots, known for their martial qualities, were the very first to join the Greek liberation movement (a claim shared with many other Greek areas) and their contribution proved to be pivotal. The society called the Filiki Eteria sent their representatives Perrevos and Chrisospathis to organize the Maniots. On March 17, 1821, 12,000 Maniots gathered in the church of the Taxiarchs (Archangels) of the town of Areopoli and declared war against the Ottoman Empire, preceding the rest of Greece by about a week. Their flag was white with a blue cross in the center. Atop the flag was the motto \"Victory or death\". The Maniots were responsible for writing \"Victory\" and not \"Freedom\" on their banner, since Mani was always free. At the bottom of the flag was an ancient Spartan inscription, \"With the shield or on the shield.\"\nOn March 21, an army of 2,000 Maniots under the command of Petros Mavromichalis, Theodoros Kolokotronis, and Papaflessas marched towards Kalamata. On March 23, they captured the city. From Kalamata, Mavromichalis wrote letters to the states of Europe, informing them of what the Greeks were doing and signing them as \"Commander in Chief of the Spartan Forces\". The Messenian Senate was also held in Kalamata. Kolokotronis wanted to attack Tripolitsa and capture the main Turkish city in the Peloponnese. However, Mavromichalis wanted to capture the smaller towns first and then take Tripolitsa. The Senate agreed with Mavromichalis, and the Maniots attacked the Turks of Messenia and Laconia.\n\nKolokotronis, convinced that he was correct, moved into Arcadia with 300 Maniots. When he entered Arcadia his band of 300 fought a Turkish force of 1,300 men and defeated them. On April 28, a few thousand Maniot soldiers under the command of Petros Mavromichalis' sons joined Kolokotronis' camp outside Tripolitsa. On September 12, 1821, the Turkish capital in the Peloponnese fell. On July 4 1822, Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis, Petros Mavromichalis' younger brother, was killed in Splantza, near the Souliote fortress of Kiafa. \n\nMahmud II became desperate and during 1824 called on his Viceroy, Muhammad Ali of Egypt, to aid him to attack Mani. Ali promised to aid him in return for the islands of Crete and Cyprus, as well as making his eldest son, Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt, pasha of the Peloponnese. Mahmud II accepted the offer and Ali sent his son in command of the expedition. Meanwhile, the Greeks were in disarray because of political rivalries, which caused a civil war. Kolokotronis was arrested, his son Panos was killed, and his nephew Nikitaras fled.\n\nIbrahim made good use of this turmoil and landed with his army (25-30,000 infantry, cavalry and artillery supported by the Ottoman-Egyptian fleet) at Methoni. Ibrahim soon had recaptured the Peloponnese except for Nafplio and Mani. When he tried to capture Nafplio, he was repelled by Dimitrios Ypsilantis and Konstantinos Mavromichalis, Petros' brother.\n\nIbrahim then decided to head for Mani. He sent an envoy to the Maniots demanding that they surrender or else he would ravage their land. Instead of surrendering, the Maniots replied:\n\n\"From the few Greeks of Mani and the rest of Greeks who live there to Ibrahim Pasha. We received your letter in which you try to frighten us saying that if we don't surrender, you'll kill the Maniots and plunder Mani. That's why we are waiting for you and your army. We, the inhabitants of Mani, sign and await you.\"\n\nEnraged by the Spartan reply, Ibrahim, commanding an army of 7,000 men, attacked Mani on June 21, 1826. He was stopped at the walls of Almiros and Verga, which ran for around 500 meters. Defending the walls were 2,000 Maniots under the command of Ilias Mavromichalis (Katsakos) and 500 Greek refugees. As Ibrahim moved his infantry and cavalry against the Maniot position, he also ordered two of his ships, including the one he was on, to attack the Maniot fortifications from the sea with their artillery. The Egyptian army attacked the Maniot position eight times and was thrown back. The fighting continued for a few more days before the Egyptians retreated when rumors that Kolokotronis was approaching their rear with 2,000 men proved true. The Maniots pursued the Egyptians all the way to Kalamata before returning to Verga. This battle not only was costly for Ibrahim, who suffered 2,500 casualties, but also ruined his plan to invade Mani from the north.\n\nWhile Ibrahim was beginning his attack on the Maniot position at Verga, he decided to launch a small fleet and attack Areopoli. This plan was described by Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos as \"excellent\" because it would catch Areopoli by surprise since it was ill defended. By capturing Areopoli, Ibrahim could disrupt the Maniot communication lines and control the mountain passes that led to Gytheio. This would also allow the Egyptians to attack the Maniots at Verga from the rear.\n\nOn June 24, Ibrahim sent a small fleet carrying 1,500 troops to land at the Bay of Diros and capture Areopoli. As the Egyptians landed on the beach, the alarm bells rang. Soon, 300 women and old men who had been harvesting the crops gathered and, armed only with their scythes and cudgels, charged at the Egyptians. The Egyptians, not expecting any resistance, were caught by surprise at this sudden attack and were forced to retreat to a fortified position on the beach where they could receive support from their ships. Eventually, 300 Maniots arrived from other towns, and the Egyptians were forced to either swim to their ships or be slain. Not only was Ibrahim's defeat costly, as he lost 1,000 men, but his plan to invade and conquer Mani was utterly ruined. Later on, the women of Diros were dubbed the 'Amazons of Diros'.\n\nIbrahim, annoyed by his defeats at Verga and Diros, plundered the Peloponnese for a month before turning his attention back to Mani. He sent an army of 6,000 Arabs to advance to the Taygetus and capture Gytheio and Laconian Mani. In command of the army was a Greek traitor from the village of Vordonia, called Bosinas. As he advanced towards Polytsaravos (nowadays a deserted place in the southern part of Taygetus), he was stopped by Theodoros Stathakos, who together with his family of thirteen people was waiting in their tower. Bosinas tried to make Stathakos surrender, and when the latter feigned surrender, Bosinas came towards the tower. However, once Bosinas was within range, Stathakos and his small band killed him. In retaliation, Bosinas' army shot at the tower with their cannons and destroyed it.\n\nThe Egyptians then proceeded towards the town of Polytsaravos and reached it on August 28. The inhabitants of the town had sent the women and children to take refuge in the mountains before improving the fortifications they had there. The town militia was reinforced by other Maniots, and soon the defenders numbered 2,500 men. The Egyptians had trouble advancing to Polytsaravos, because it was surrounded by rocks situated on high ground. As soon as the Arabs arrived, the Maniots rallied around their fortifications and attacked the Arabs. The Arabs retreated from Polytsaravos after sustaining 400 casualties while the Maniots only suffered nine. Even though this campaign is overshadowed by other battles of the revolution, it was one of the most important, according to Maniot regional historians. The Maniots stopped the Egyptians and Ibrahim Pasha who had not been defeated this decisively before. This was the last invasion of Mani by the Egyptians or the Ottomans, as the Peloponnese, central Greece, and some of the Aegean islands were liberated in 1828 after the naval forces of Bourbon Restoration France under Henri de Rigny, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland under Edward Codrington, and the Russian Empire under Login Geiden defeated Ibrahim at the Navarino in 1827.\n\nIn 1831, Ioannis Kapodistrias became governor of Greece. Kapodistrias quarreled with the Mavromichalis clan because the Maniots refused to pay taxes to the new government. Kapodistrias requested that Tzanis, Petros' brother, go to Nafplio, then capital of Greece, and negotiate. As soon as Tzanis arrived, he was arrested and imprisoned. Kapodistrias then sent soldiers to Mani and had Petros arrested, imprisoned, and charged with high treason. His brother Konstantinos, the defender of Nafplio, and Petros' son, Georgios Mavromichalis, were put under house arrest in the capital.\n\nOn September 27, 1831 (October 9 in the Gregorian calendar), Kapodistrias went to attend a church service at the Church of Saint Spyridon. He noticed that Konstantinos and Georgios were waiting at the church doors. As he passed them, he briefly stopped before proceeding into the church. As he was about to step into the church, Konstantinos used his gun and the bullet hit Kapodistrias at the back of the head while at the same time Georgios stabbed him through the heart. Kapodistrias collapsed into the arms of his attendants. Kapodistrias' bodyguard shot Konstantinos as he was running, and Konstantinos was hit by several more bullets before he died. Kostantinos' body was then dragged by an angry mob, who threw it into the sea. Georgios was captured and executed on the island of Bourzi, off the coast of Nafplio, while his father watched.\n\nIn 1833, Otto von Wittelsbach, a son of Ludwig I of Bavaria and Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen, became King of Greece after he was appointed by the Great Powers. Since he was underage, he had a Council of Regency headed by Josef Ludwig von Armansperg governing the country for him. One of the Council's first acts was to try to subdue the unruly Maniots and pull down their towers; another was to free Petros and Tzanis from their prisons. The council sent an army of Bavarians in order to tame Mesa Mani. They made it to Areopoli, but during the night the Maniots surrounded and captured them, forcing them to leave the area.\n\nOn May 14, 1834, four companies of Bavarian troops, assisted by four cannons, besieged the town of Petrovouni. Ultimately, 800 Maniots from the surrounding towns attacked the Bavarians. The Bavarians were massacred as most of them were either slain by the Maniots or fell into a ravine near the town while escaping. Later that year, an army of 6,000 men with five cannons under the command of General Christian von Schmaltz, assisted by five squadrons of royalist Maniots, once again besieged Petrovouni. When news of an army of 1,000 Maniots was approaching, they retreated to Gytheio.\n\nThe Council decided that they could not subdue the Maniots by force, so they decided to send a diplomat, Max Feder, with the intention of subduing Mani by playing the love of money against the love of independence. He went to different Maniot families and offered them positions if they supported the king. Many of the Achamnomeri (see note α below) and some Megalogenites were convinced by his offers and submitted. However, several of the older families and the poorer Achamnomeri rejected the offer, because the former did not want to be dependent on a king and the latter did not want governors with superior rights.\nIn Kitta, this division caused bloodshed when the king's supporters started fighting the other Maniots under the command of Giorgaros Skylakakos. Feder soon arrived with his new allies and exploded Skylakakos and all his allies in his towers. Thus the Bavarians managed to annex the whole peninsula to the Greek kingdom.\n\nDuring Otto's rule, blood was spilled in Mani because of the vendettas, which have plagued the area for centuries. The vendettas continued until 1870, when a Maniot vendetta was halted by the efforts of a regular army with artillery support. In 1841, Crete revolted against the Ottomans. The Maniots, described as \"cousins\" of the Cretans, rushed to Crete to support them. The Cretans, together with the Maniots, forced the Turks into a fortress, where they besieged them. A combined Ottoman-British fleet managed to subdue the Cretans, but the undefeated Maniots chose to go back to Mani. In 1866, a new revolution sparked in Crete, and 2,000 Maniots under the command of Petropoulakos went to assist their cousins. However, the Cretans were defeated, and the undefeated Maniots again returned to Mani.\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, Greece was involved with the Macedonian Struggle, military conflicts against the Bulgarian organization known as the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, and Turkish forces in Ottoman-occupied Macedonia. Many volunteers from Mani took part in the war such as soldiers from the Dritsakos, Koutsonikolakos, Kosteas, Georgopapadakos, Iliopiereas, Loukakos, Kyriakoulakos, and Kalantzakos families. The Maniots also took part in the series of wars that followed including the Balkan Wars, World War I, and the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922). The participation of troops from Mani in these wars under Constantine I of Greece, created strong royalist feelings amongst Maniots. That is why most Maniots remained loyal to Constantine during the Greek National Schism.\n\nDuring World War II, the Maniot armed forces significantly helped the Hellenic Army to win the Battle of Greece. A Maniot named Colonel Konstantinos Davakis was among the leaders of the armed forces. Davakis, in command of the Pindus Detachment, defeated the elite Italian SOF brigade \"Julia\" at the Battle of Pindus (October 28-November 13, 1940), despite the Italians having more advanced weaponry.\n\nLater, Maniots won another victory when the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom defeated the Regia Marina of Italy in the Battle of Cape Matapan (March 27-March 29, 1941) on Cape Tenaro. However, Nazi Germany attacked Greece in order to support the Italians. The Greeks were forced to retreat, and soon Mani revived its forgotten role as a center for refugees. During April 1941, the British started evacuating their troops from Porto Kagio. By the end of that month, Mani and the rest of Greece were under Italian and German occupation.\n\nDuring the occupation, Mani became a stronghold of the Security Battalions, because of the anti-communist sentiment of the Maniots. The Germans and Italians left Greece in 1944, but as soon as they left the Greek Civil War began. The armies of the Communist Party of Greece, ELAS, and DSE, fought against the Hellenic Army and the royalists. Mani never recovered from both wars, and soon many of the young people of Mani left for Athens, the United States, and Australia.\n\nNowadays, Mani is divided between two regional units: Laconia and Messenia. Mani has around 18,000 inhabitants, with the most important and populous town being Gytheio. Mani's main source of income is tourism. The most famous of the tourist attractions are the Caves of Diros, which are two caves that have underwater rivers flowing through them.\n\nThe Maniot dialect of Modern Greek has several archaic properties that distinguishes it from most mainstream varieties. One of them, shared with the highly divergent Tsakonian as well as with the old dialects spoken around Athens until the 19th century, is the divergent treatment of historical (written <υ>). Although this sound merged to everywhere else, these dialects have instead (e.g. versus standard 'wood'). These varieties are thought to be relic areas of a previously larger areal dialect group that used to share these features and was later divided by the penetration of Arvanitika settlement in much of its area in the late Middle Ages.\n\nOther features of the Maniot dialect include the palatalization of velar consonants, i.e. the realization of as ( or before . This feature is shared with many southern dialects of Greek, especially Cretan.\n\nThere is little information on the economy of Mani during the early stages of Ottoman dominance of Greece, and what is known of the economy in the 17th and 18th centuries is from foreign observers. In Exo Mani ('outer Mani'), olives were grown in great numbers but it was not until the 18th century that olives were widely spread in Mesa Mani ('inner Mani'). Exports from Exo Mani also included pine for masts as well turpentine, hides as well as a tanning agent and , a crimson-colored dye. The north-west parts of Mesa Mani were rich in mulberries and silk. Honey is also of superior quality. Another important part of the Maniot economy was piracy. Nowadays the main industries in Mani are agriculture and tourism.\n\nTwo dances come from Mani: (, ) and the Modern Maniatiko. The Palio Maniatiko is only found in Mani and is described as an ancient dance. The Modern Maniatiko is the modern version of the Palio Maniatiko dance and includes certain aspects of the Kalamatiano dance in it. Like the Palio Maniatiko, it is only performed in Mani.\n\nPart of Maniot culture involved piracy. The Maniots were famous and fearsome pirates whose ships dominated the Maniot coastline. The Maniots became pirates because Mani was not a very fertile land and the Maniots did not have many natural resources. The Maniots considered piracy a legitimate response to the fact that their land was poor, and it became their main source of income. The pirate raids were not stopped by the local priests of the Eastern Orthodox Church, who in fact blessed the ships before they left and sometimes accompanied them on raids. Most of the Maniot pirates came from (, 'Inner Mani'). The main victims of Maniot pirates were the Ottomans, but the ships of powerful European nations were targeted as well.\n\nThere is a strong history of superstition and folklore in Maniot culture; most common stories revolve around witches, demons, vampires, and ghosts. When Henry Herbert, 3rd Earl of Carnarvon, was touring Mani in 1839, he found a fresh egg by the side of the road and offered it to a Maniot soldier who escorted him, who declined the offer explaining that if a hag had enchanted it he would have to marry her. The Maniots thought that certain areas were haunted by demons.\n\nAnother important aspect of Maniot culture were the vendettas which frequently plagued Mani. Usually, the decision to start a vendetta was made at a family gathering. The main aim of a vendetta was usually to wipe out the other family. The families involved locked themselves in their towers and whenever they got the chance murdered members of the opposing family. The other families in the village normally locked themselves in their towers in order not to get in the way of the fighting.\n\nVendettas could go on for months, sometimes years, and usually ended when one family was exterminated or left the town. In some cases (like the tit for tat killing of a murderer) vendettas would be concluded after the 'guilty' individual(s) were killed. In other cases vendettas, particularly long running ones, were ended in a peaceful to terms or exchange of property. In the case of long vendettas, families often agreed upon a temporary (, 'truce') in order to allow for crop harvests or the attendance of religious ceremonies; when the ended, the killing could resume. A cornerstone of the Maniot's vendetta culture was the agreement that all vendettas immediately stop in a universal whenever the community faced a Turkish threat. The longest of all was announced by the Mavromichalis clan when war was declared on the Ottoman Empire in March of 1821, beginning the Greek War for Independence. Vendettas continued after the liberation of Greece even though the Regency tried to demolish the towers. The Maniot vendetta culture is considered one of the most vicious and ruthless of all the Mediterranean vendetta cultures. One of the last large scale vendettas on record required the Greek Police, 1,000 Greek Army soldiers, and 200 Greek Navy sailors to stop.\n\nLocal specialities:\n\n\nThe inhabitants of Mani claim to be direct descendants of the ancient Spartans and are considered more \"pure-blooded\" Greeks. According to their story, after the Romans took over Laconia, many of the Spartan citizens who were loyal to the Spartan laws of Lycurgus decided to go to the Spartan mountains of Mani with the rest of the Spartans rather than be in Achaean or, later, Roman service. Kassis claims that Maniots rarely mated with non-Maniots until the 20th century.\n\nMani became a refuge during the 4th century when the Barbarian invasions started in Europe. When the Avars and Slavs invaded the Peloponnese, many Greek refugees fled to Mani since the invaders could not infiltrate the mountainous terrain. According to Constantine Porphyrogenitus, the Maniots were not conquered by the Slavs and were descended from the ancient 'Romaioi'. Historian David Howarth states: \"\"The only Greeks that have had an unbroken descent were the few small clans like the Maniotes who were so fierce, and lived so far up the mountain, that invaders left them alone.\"\"\n\n"}

He was also the younger brother of Mi Zhu, who also served Liu Bei. In 219, Mi Fang surrendered to Liu Bei's ally-turned rival Sun Quan, directly resulting in the loss of Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) and the death of Guan Yu. The Australian sinologist Rafe de Crespigny notes that Mi Fang had the remarkable record of serving each of the leaders of the Three Kingdoms during his lifetime.\n\nMi Fang was from Qu County (), Donghai Commandery (), which is present-day Lianyungang, Jiangsu. He was born in an extremely rich merchant family, which had over 10,000 slaves and guests. Mi Fang and his elder brother Mi Zhu were said to be proficient in horsemanship and archery. Along with the Chen clan (led by Chen Gui and Chen Deng), the Mi family served under Tao Qian, the Governor of Xu Province (徐州; present-day northern Jiangsu).\n\nUpon Tao Qian's death, the influential Mi clan strongly advocated the governorship be passed on to Liu Bei, to whom Mi Fang had his sister married. Thereafter, the Mi brothers joined Liu Bei's army to Xuyi and Huaiyin (淮陰; in Guangling, south of Xu Province) to counter-attack the warlord Yuan Shu in 196 CE. Zhang Fei, who was left behind by Liu Bei to guard Xiapi (capital of Xu Province at the time), killed Cao Bao, the chancellor of Xiapi when Tao Qian was still in charge of Xu Province, after an intense quarrel over some trivial things. Cao Bao's death caused unrest in the city, and the locals opened the city gate for Lü Bu, who then seized control of the city, capturing the families of Liu Bei and Mi Fang during the process. Upon hearing the news, Liu Bei's soldiers started to desert, and the remnant was defeated by the enemy commander Ji Ling. Liu Bei then retreated to Haixi (), Donghai Commandery (). Faced with enemies on both sides and a lack of supplies, the Mi brothers encouraged Liu Bei and used their personal wealth to support the army. Seeing no other viable option, Liu Bei requested for a truce with Lü Bu, who accepted and returned Liu Bei's family as an act of good faith. In fear of being isolated by Yuan Shu, Lü Bu obstructed further attempts by Yuan Shu to eliminate Liu Bei.\n\nLiu Bei moved his camp to Xiaopei where he was financed by the Mi brothers to rebuild his army, gathering over 10,000 men. Lü Bu became concerned and attacked Xiaopei. Liu Bei then fled to Xuchang, where warlord Cao Cao set his base. When Liu Bei served under Cao, the latter enticed Mi Zhu and Mi Fang by offering them governorships of Ying Commandery (嬴郡; northwest of present-day Laiwu, Shandong) and Pengcheng Commandery respectively, but both chose to follow Liu Bei when their brother-in-law left Cao Cao, giving up the high positions for an unknown future.\n\nLater, Liu Bei betrayed Cao Cao, and fled to the south after being defeated several times by the latter. After the battle of Jiangling, Liu Bei successfully negotiated the southern warlord Sun Quan to lend him Nan Commandery (南郡; present-day Jiangling, Hubei) of Jing Province, and Mi Fang was assigned the post of the Administrator of the commandery. When Liu Bei embarked for Yi Province, Mi Fang was ordered to stay behind with Guan Yu in Jing Province.\n\nIn 219, Guan Yu launched an invasion against Cao Cao, leaving Mi Fang with the defence of the base city in Jiangling, and Shi Ren in Gong'an County. Earlier, Mi Fang had accidentally set some military equipment ablaze, and Guan threatened to dish out harsh punishment should he triumph over Cao Cao. Since then, Mi Fang had been fraught with fear and receiving letters from Sun Quan, who was also a brother-in-law to Liu Bei, and also disgraced by Guan Yu's insolence.\n\nThus, when Sun Quan launched a surprise attack on Jiangling, Mi Fang listened to Shi Ren's suggestion and surrendered. Sandwiched on both sides by enemies, Guan Yu was captured by Lü Meng and executed. Mi Zhu was deeply ashamed of his brother's betrayal, and soon died of sickness. Mi Fang was not only blackened by Yang Xi () of Shu Han for his betrayal, but had also been derided by Yu Fan of Eastern Wu for the very same reason.\n\nIn June, 223, an Eastern Wu commander named Jin Zong in charge of Qichun () defected to Wei by launching a rebellion, so Sun Quan ordered He Qi to put down the rebellion. Mi Fang then served under He Qi as a commander, along with another two generals named Liu Shao (劉邵, not to be confused with 劉劭) and Xianyu Dan (), and they succeeded the mission, capturing Jin Zong alive and retaking Qichun. That was the last historical record of Mi Fang, after which he was not mentioned again.\n\nOnce, Mi Fang's boat met with that of Yu Fan in a narrow waterway, the servants on Mi Fang's boat demanded Yu Fan to move out of the way by shouting: \"Get out of the way for our general's boat.\" Yu Fan shouted back angrily in response: \"How can one serve the lord when he had lost his loyalty? And how can one be called a general when he caused his [former] master to lose two cities?\" Mi Fang was very ashamed and let Yu Fan's boat to pass instead. Another incident also involved Yu Fan when he had to pass through Mi Fang's camp. The officers at Mi Fang's camp did not open the gates, and Yu Fan angrily shouted: \"How can one do this when what is supposed to be open is closed, but what is supposed to be closed is open instead?\" Mi Fang was even more ashamed than he was in the waterway. Despite the ridicule, Sun Quan still treated Mi Fang with trust and dignity.\n\nIn the 14th-century historical novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\", both Mi Fang and Shi Ren (erroneously referred to as \"Fu Shiren\" in the novel) served in the Eastern Wu military after they surrendered to Sun Quan. In chapter 83, Liu Bei personally led a force against Eastern Wu to avenge Guan Yu. When they discovered that their men were plotting to kill them and surrender to Liu Bei, Mi and Fu assassinated their superior Ma Zhong () and surrendered to Liu Bei. However, the unimpressed Liu ordered Guan Xing, son of Guan Yu, to execute the traitors as a sacrifice to Guan Yu.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2266829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2266829", "title": "Alwin Nikolais", "text": "Alwin Nikolais\n\nAlwin Nikolais (November 25, 1910 – May 8, 1993) was an American choreographer.\n\nNikolais was born in Southington, Connecticut. He studied piano at an early age and began his performing career as an organist accompanying silent films. As a young artist, he gained skills in scenic design, acting, puppetry and music composition. It was after attending a performance by the German dancer Mary Wigman that he was inspired to study dance. He received his early dance training at Bennington College from the great figures of the modern dance world: Hanya Holm, Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman, Louis Horst, and others.\n\nIn 1940, in collaboration with Truda Kaschmann, his first modern dance teacher, Nikolais received a commission to create \"Eight Column Line\", his first ballet. The work was presented at one of the events of Hartford social season that counted Salvador Dalí and Léonide Massine as honorary patrons and was well received.\n\nAfter teaching two years at his own studio and touring the US with dancers from Hanya Holm's company, Nikolais did active duty in the Army during World War II as a master sergeant in criminal investigation. Nikolais relocated to New York City following the war and resumed studying with Hanya Holm. Eventually, he became Holm's assistant, teaching at her New York school and at Colorado College during the summers. In 1948, Nikolais was appointed director of the Henry Street Playhouse, which had been left in a state of transition and had to be entirely re-established. He formed the Playhouse Dance Company, which was later renamed and known as the Nikolais Dance Theatre. It was at Henry Street that Nikolais began to develop his own world of abstract dance theatre, portraying man as part of a total environment. Nikolais redefined dance, as \"the art of motion which, left on its own merits, becomes the message as well as the medium\". He Stated \"The Province of art is to explore the inner mechanisms and extra dimensional areas of life and, out of the exploration, to produce its findings translated into the form of the artist's media.\" It was also at Henry Street Playhouse that Mr. Nikolais was joined by Murray Louis, who was to become a driving force in the Playhouse Company, Nikolais' leading dancer and longtime collaborator.\n\nIn 1956, the Nikolais Dance Theater was invited to its first of many appearances at the American Dance Festival. With this, and a number of appearances on televisions The Steve Allen Show, his total dance theatre had begun to take shape, and the company established itself in the forefront of American contemporary dance. In the 1960s his choreographic artistry was showcased once again on live network television for the \"CBS Repertoire Workshop.\"\n\nFollowing the Audio Engineering Society convention, in October 1964, Nikolais saw and immediately placed an order for the first Moog analog synthesizer system.\n\nWith the company's 1968 Paris season at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, Nikolais' impact on dance grew internationally. Following Paris, the company began performing around the world. Here began a long artistic relationship with the Théâtre de la Ville which began in 1971 and continues now after his death.\n\nIn 1978, the French National Ministry of Culture invited him to form the Centre Nationale de la Danse Contemporaine in Angers, France. In December 1980, he created his 99th choreographic work Schema, for the Paris Opera. At the same time, his choreography for an opera by Gian Carlo Menotti was being staged at the Vienna Staatsoper.\n\nIn 1987, Nikolais was awarded the National Medal of Arts, bestowed by President Ronald Reagan, and the Kennedy Center Honors, conferred during a three-day round of official Washington events, which culminated in a CBS telecast featuring the Nikolais Dance Theater. Alwin Nikolais gave the world a new vision of dance and was named the \"father of multi-media theater.\" He received the City of Paris' highest honor, the Grande Medaille de Vermeille de la Ville de Paris, as well as medals from Seville, Spain, Athens, Greece, and 30 other cities both foreign and national as well as a special citation from New York City's Mayor, which he shared with Murray Louis. Often referred to as the American Patriarch of French modern dance, Nikolais is a knight of France's Legion of Honor and a commander of the Order of Arts and Letters.\n\nHis accolades from the world of arts and letters included the Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award; the Capezio Award; Circulo Criticos Award, Chile; Emmy Citation Award; Dance Magazine Award; the Tiffany Award; and the American Dance Guild Award. In 2000 he was inducted into the National Museum of Dance's Mr. & Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame.\n\nNikolais was granted five honorary doctorate degrees, was twice designated a Guggenheim Fellow, and was the recipient of a three-year creativity grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Mr. Nikolais and his work have been featured in numerous films and television programs in the US and abroad. In July 1987, \"Nik and Murray\", a feature-length documentary film about Nikolais and Murray Louis, directed by Christian Blackwood, aired on the PBS series \"American Masters\".\n\nNikolais was renowned as a master teacher, and his pedagogy is taught in schools and universities throughout the world. He died of cancer May 8, 1993, in New York and is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.\n\nNikolais employed lights, slides, electronic music, and stage props to create environments through which dancers moved and, more important, into which they blended (Dance Magazine). He would commonly use props with aesthetic as well as functional purposes; for instance, a traveler moving across the stage would hide a crossing and simultaneously create a volume of motion. His production MASKS, PROPS, and MOBILES was accredited to have created and popularized modern multimedia theater (Mazo, Joseph), although, some critics rejected Nikolais work as dance, especially when Nikolais transformed the bodies of dancers by covering them in plastic bags that would stretch and change shapes in Noumenon; a section from Masks, Props and Mobiles (1953). He avoided overused themes like psychosexuality, good vs. evil, or heroes and heroines. Instead, he chose to move away from the life of the individual and focus on group action. He preferred also to develop his own style of movement, and not to replicate the moves of previous time periods or other composers.\n\nNikolais' V artistic mandate was for meaning to be conveyed strictly through movement. He characterized his stage presentations as \"decentralizing\" the dancer, so that humans were only one of the theatrical elements on stage. Nikolais despised of modern dance's obsession with self. Nikolais's dance technique is a barefoot one, a tradition handed down from the days of Isadora Duncan, who, we are told, took off her shoes in empathy for the ancient Greeks. However, Nikolais does not use bare feet out of homage. To him the bare foot is practical. Its muscular and tactile functions are essential to the performance of the total body. Nor does he utilize the bare foot and then ignore it. Apparent mutilation of the body design by the termination of the costume may disturb the image and when it does, he uses whatever device will serve his aesthetic. Many such devices are primary to the concept. In \"Discs,\" the opening dance in Kaleidoscope, the dancers wear large colored aluminum discs on one foot, which serve in various aesthetic capacities. Originally intended simply to extend the dancer's range of balance by providing a larger than normal base, they also add a vertical extension as a great \"toe shoe\" might; they increase motional dynamics with their added weight in swinging. The shape, color, and material were aesthetic decisions, producing moving visual elements in themselves, and the heavy aluminum gives a satisfying, large, loud clang when the dancers stomp the floor. In a section of Stratus and Nimbus (1961) and again in Scenario the dancers wear small sound-producing fiberboard circles on each foot. The use, the material, and the size of these \"tappers\" were aural decisions. The specific sound was the initial criteria. Although they are not seen, they do alter kinetic values by the manner in which the dancers must move to produce the desired sound.\n\nIn the 1950s a black face in a cast caused a sensory blocking. The theatergoer saw race, and all the social implication that race bore at that time. Whether positive or negative vibrations ensued in the spectator's sensorium made little difference to Nikolais. The spectator whose senses were preoccupied with racial differentiation was not perceiving Nik's images. Hence, his early treatment of the face was concerned not only with varying its uni-statement but also with preventing audiences from experiencing this sensory blocking. He used makeup: purple, red, green, yellow, half a face one color—half another, as in Kaleidoscope; or strips of color following the costume design, as in Prism; or he used whiteface, as in Imago. This use of makeup does not create character, but rather design, and is a part of the total concept of the dances in which it occurs.\n\nHe was notoriously well known in the dance industry because of his use of lighting. He would use light sources from every direction and level to create new shapes, spaces, and silhouettes. With his modern, new style, he felt that most music was ill-suited for it. He went back to his days as an early musical composer and designed his own score on electronic tape. Within the Henry Street Playhouse, the tapes would be played over a seven speaker system distributed throughout the room to give another time and space dimension. The combination of cast, original lighting and music, with modern dance techniques, gained The Nikolais Dance Theatre a world-renowned reputation in the theatrical arts. Receiving high regards from New York State Council on the Arts, Hofstra University, Rutgers University, Duke University, Hunter College, and Brigham Young University. With his own school and theatre, he withdrew from the spotlight of the dance world, known amongst colleagues and peers as a shy, reserved individual, allowing his partner Murray Louis to deal with more public affairs. Mr. Nikolais was renowned as a master teacher, and his pedagogy is taught in schools and universities throughout the world. Nikolais, referring to his students: \"Each student is encouraged toward the highest aesthetic values, and upon creative fluency and achievement, as well as technical skill. The job of the teacher is to pursue, institute and constantly anticipate the best possible activities coinciding with this idealistic thesis.\"\n\nThe first production by Nikolais, after the creation of the Henry Street Playhouse, now Abrons Arts Center, was called KALEIDOSCOPE and premiered at the American Dance Festival. It aired in the spring of 1956 and showcased his company of seven dancers, intensively trained by him, for the past 7 years. The next production to follow PRISM, BEWITCHED, AND CANTOS was an improvisational performance by the dancers that utilized mirrors and the specific use of score and lighting. The act was performed on four separate occasions and was different each time. TOTEM, an act centered on religion and fetish with an element of barbarism, was performed at the Fifth Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy. The act received serious criticism. Following this, Nikolais went the complete opposite direction for his next performance, IMAGO. This act was meticulous and orderly; the performers were placed in similar make-up and headdress to accentuate unity. A much larger production, SANCTUM, showcased 27 performers, compared to the standard 10-15 Nikolais commonly used. This act dealt with opposites: natural vs. man-made, reality vs. imagination, primitive vs. sophisticated. The performance sold-out for 6 straight weeks in New York.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2266832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2266832", "title": "Jordaan", "text": "Jordaan\n\nThe Jordaan is a neighbourhood of the city of Amsterdam, Netherlands. It is part of the borough of Amsterdam-Centrum. The area is bordered by the Singelgracht canal and the neighbourhood of Frederik Hendrikbuurt to the west; the Prinsengracht to the east; the Brouwersgracht to the north and the Leidsegracht to the south. The former canal Rozengracht (now filled in) is the main traffic artery through the neighbourhood.\n\nOriginally a working-class neighbourhood, the Jordaan has become one of the most expensive, upscale locations in the Netherlands. It is home to many art galleries, particularly for modern art, and is also dotted with speciality shops and restaurants. Markets are held regularly at Noordermarkt, the Westerstraat (the Lapjesmarkt textile market) and Lindengracht.\n\nRembrandt spent the last years of his life in the Jordaan, on the Rozengracht canal. He was buried in the Westerkerk church, at the corner of Rozengracht and Prinsengracht, just beyond the Jordaan. The Anne Frank House, where Anne Frank went into hiding during World War II, is located on the edge of the Jordaan, on the Prinsengracht canal.\n\nThe most common theory on the origin of the name is as a derivation of the French word \"jardin\", meaning garden: most streets and canals in the Jordaan are named after trees and flowers. Another theory is that the Prinsengracht canal was once nicknamed Jordaan (the Dutch name for the river Jordan), and that the neighbourhood beyond the canal came to be called this as well.\n\nThe Jordaan has a high concentration of \"hofjes\" (inner courtyards), many of them with restored houses and peaceful gardens. These courtyards were built by rich people for elderly women, as a kind of charity. By the 1970s most of these courtyards were in very bad shape, like the rest of the neighbourhood. Since then, many have been restored and are now inhabited mainly by artists, students and some elderly people. During the summer some of these yards are opened on Sundays during free concerts known as \"hofjesconcerten\".\n\nMany houses in the Jordaan have a stone tablet on their facade, a stone sign displaying the profession or family sign of the inhabitants. For instance a butcher displayed a pig and a tailor a pair of scissors, carved in stone above the entry. The first such stone tablets were made in the 16th century, when citizens were ordered to use these tablets instead of big wooden gables that obstructed the traffic in the narrow streets.\n\nConstruction of the Jordaan began in 1612, when it was called \"Het Nieuwe Werck\" (The New Work). The streets and canals were built according to the old ditches and paths, which explains its unusual orientation compared to the rest of the city. In the 19th century, six of the Jordaan's canals were filled in, including the Rozengracht.\n\nThe neighbourhood was traditionally a leftwing stronghold, with a stormy history. Heavy riots broke out in 1835, 1886, 1917 and 1934. The February strike of 1941 started with meetings on Noordermarkt square.\n\nThe Jordaan had a lively music scene in the 20th century. Several of the most popular musicians now have a statue in their memory at the corner of Prinsengracht and Elandsgracht. The singer Willy Alberti is commemorated with a memorial plaque on the Westerkerk church. The Jordaanfestival, celebrating the neighbourhood's music tradition, is held annually.\n\nStarting in the 1960s, many of the neighbourhood's original working-class residents moved out of the city to more affordable locations, mainly to Almere and Purmerend.\n\n"}

The Sea Center focuses on the marine life and the related conservation of the Santa Barbara Channel.\n\nThe Sea Center, first opened in 1986, was forced to close almost immediately owing to a fire under the Stearns Wharf pier on which it sits, and opened again a year later after repairs and more exhibits were added. Among the highlights of the original museum, and which still exist today, are a life-size model of a grey whale and her calf, aquaria, and static exhibits about marine life and ocean ecology. After many successful years, an opportunity became available to expand, adding building space, larger touch tanks, and new exhibits. The Center reopened in 2005 at a cost of $6.5 million. The expanded building's major donor at that time was businessman Ty Warner, also a local resident. Following a rebranding of the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History in 2016, the Sea Center returned to its original name.\n\n\n"}

The Etesian winds are a dominant weather influence in the Aegean Basin.\n\nThey are at their strongest in the afternoon and often die down at night, but sometimes meltemi winds last for days without a break. Similar winds blow in the Adriatic and Ionian regions. Meltemi winds are dangerous to sailors because they come up in clear weather without warning and can blow at 7–8 Beaufort. Some yachts and most inter-island ferries cannot sail under such conditions. However, they often provide a good, steady sailing wind favored by leisure sailors.\n\nThe word \"etesian\" ultimately derives from the Greek word \"etos\" \"year\", connotating the yearly fluctuation in frequency of appearance of these winds. Etesians have been described since ancient times; their Turkish and the Modern Greek names are probably a loan from Italian \"mal tempo\" 'bad weather'. Though it is sometimes called a monsoon wind, the meltemi is dry and does not correspond to an opposite wind in the winter. However, the etesians are distantly correlated with the summer monsoons of the Indian subcontinent, as it is a trough of low pressure into the Eastern Mediterranean region that enforces, if not causes, the etesians to blow in summer. A Mediterranean climate is sometimes called an etesian climate.\n\nEtesians are due chiefly to the deep continental depression centered over southwest Asia and blow from a direction which may be anywhere between north-east and north-west depending on local topography; meltemi weather is ordinarily fine and clear, the northerly winds tempering the fierce summer heat of the region.\n\nIn the Northern Aegean sea, the etesians blow as winds of northeasterly to northerly direction. Moving south, in the central Aegean, they blow as winds of northerly direction, while in the southern Aegean, the Cretan and the Carpathian sea, they blow as northwesterlies. The same winds blow in Cyprus as westerlies to southwesterlies, being more humid.\n\nHistorically, Philip II of Macedon timed his military operations so that powerful southern fleets could not reach him: their ships could sail north only very slowly while the Etesian winds were blowing.\n\n\n"}

Hebert Law Center, often styled \"LSU Law\", is a public law school in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. It is part of the Louisiana State University System and located on the main campus of Louisiana State University.\n\nBecause Louisiana is a civil law state, unlike its 49 common law sister states, the curriculum includes both civil law and common law courses, requiring 94 hours for graduation; the most in the United States. In the Fall of 2002, the LSU Law Center became the sole United States law school, and only one of two law schools in the Western Hemisphere, offering a course of study leading to the simultaneous conferring of a J.D. (Juris Doctor), which is the normal first degree in American law schools, and a D.C.L. (Diploma in Comparative Law), which recognizes the training its students receive in both the common and the civil law.\n\nUntil voting in April 2015 to realign itself as an academic unit of Louisiana State University, the Paul M. Hebert Law Center was an autonomous campus of, rather than a dependent academic unit of the larger university. Its designation as a Law Center, rather than Law School, derives not only from its formerly independent campus status, but also from the centralization on its campus of J.D. and post-J.D. programs, foreign and graduate programs, including European programs at the Jean Moulin University Lyon 3 School of Law, France, and the University of Louvain, Belgium, and the direction of the Louisiana Law Institute and the Louisiana Judicial College, among other initiatives.\n\nAccording to the school's 2017 ABA-required disclosures, 81.3% of the Class of 2017 obtained full-time, long-term, bar passage-required employment nine months after graduation, excluding solo practitioners.\n\nIn 1904, LSU constitutional law professor Arthur T. Prescott, who earlier had been the founding president of Louisiana Tech University, became the first to propose the establishment of a law school at LSU.\n\nThe law school came to fruition in 1906, under LSU president Thomas Duckett Boyd, with nineteen founding students. Since 1924, the LSU Law Center has been a member of the Association of American Law Schools and approved by the American Bar Association. The Law Center was renamed in honor of Dean Paul M. Hebert (1907–1977), the longest serving Dean of the LSU Law School, who served in that role with brief interruptions from 1937 until his death in 1977. One of these interruptions occurred in 1947-1948, when he was appointed as a judge for the United States Military Tribunals in Nuremberg.\n\nIn 2011, the Law Center received 1,437 applications for the J.D./C.L. program for an enrolled class of 239.

It was the first model for the Spanish brand entirely developed in its newly opened Martorell Technical Centre, and was thus immensely important for SEAT. When launched it was powered by the bigger 1,197 cc engine of carried from the SEAT 124, which in this application was transversely mounted and canted forwards by 16°. This engine through a four-speed gearbox transmission gave the little 2+2 a top speed of . Despite its sporting aspirations, power output was limited by a relatively low compression ratio, reflecting the fuel octane levels available on its home market.\n\nThe sharp-edged body design had a drag coefficient (c) of 0.37 and was purchased from NSU of Germany, after the German firm had abandoned its plans to launch its own small car, the based on the NSU Prinz rear-engined NSU Nergal model, presented as a prototype in the 1970 Turin Motor Show and designed by the Italian designer Aldo Sessano. It was Antoni Amat, the technical director of Inducar (Industrias de la Carrocería) i.e. an external provider for SEAT, the man who conceived the idea of proposing the whole project to SEAT with the mediation of Günter Óistrach, after the former's visit and contacts at the Turin Motor Show, with the Terrassa-based Inducar company undertaking from SEAT the production of the chassis for its SEAT 1200 Sport car. The purchased rights Nergal design had been sublimed to modifications in a mixture of elements with another Sessano's concept car i.e. the \"OTAS KL112\", in order to fit in with the underpinnings meant to be used by SEAT, as it was based upon the ones of a Fiat 127. However the remainings of the original NSU Nergal design were still present in the SEAT production model: the air-vents in the third pillar just above the rear wheel arch were likely indicating the presence of the rear-mounted engine in NSU's donor design. In fact though SEAT's engineers first examined the possibility to keep the rear-engine layout in the SEAT 1200 Sport, they made the final choice in favor of a front-engined one. Its boot featured a remote opening through a handle on to driver's door and had a capacity of 339 litres.\n\nIn 1977, the SEAT 1430 Sport Coupé was introduced, using the same body, but with a retuned version of the engine from the SEAT 1430. In this application, the 1,438-cc engine provided a power output of and a top speed of .\n\nThe Sport versions were offered mainly in the Spanish market, but also some cars were officially offered in other European countries such as Germany, Holland, Belgium, and France. Both models, 1200 and 1430, were discontinued in 1979, along with the SEAT 128, SEAT 133, and CKD-built Lancia Beta and Beta HPE, as part of the important restructuring of the SEAT range for 1980. A total of 19,332 units was sold in the Spanish market, with 11,619 cars being equipped with the 1200 engine and some 7,713 units with the more powerful but late-launched 1430 motor.\n\nThe car was widely known as the \"\"Boca negra\"\" (\"black mouth\" in Spanish) because of the color and shape of its always black plastic front panel, which embraced the front grille and the headlights and incorporated, by 1970s standards, a prominent front bumper. In 2008, SEAT presented the SEAT Bocanegra concept car at the Geneva Motor Show. It received this name as a homage to the classic 1200 Sport, as it also had a black front end. It is sold as a special-edition Ibiza model from the second half of 2009, based on the SEAT Ibiza FR and Cupra versions.\n\nSince its launch in 1975 up to 1981, 19,332 SEAT 1200 and 1430 Sport cars have been sold and produced (11,619 units for the SEAT 1200 Sport and 7,713 for the SEAT 1430 Sport version).\n\nThe total production per year of SEAT 1200 Sport and SEAT 1430 Sport cars is shown in the following table :\n"}

Its capital is the city of Chania. Chania borders only one other regional unit: that of Rethymno to the east. The western part of Crete is bounded to the north by the Cretan Sea, and to the west and south by the Mediterranean Sea. The regional unit also includes the southernmost island of Europe, Gavdos.\n\nChania regional unit, often informally termed 'Western Crete', is a part of the island which includes the districts of Apokoronas, Sfakia, and Selino in the far South West corner. Other towns in the Chania prefecture include Hora Sfakion, Kastelli-Kissamos, Palaiochora, Maleme, Vryses, Vamos, Georgioupolis and Kalives.\n\nThe natural park of Samariá Gorge, a tourist attraction and a refuge for the rare Cretan wild goat or \"kri-kri\", is in the South of the regional unit. The White Mountains or \"Lefka Ori\", through which the Samaria, Aradena, Imbros and other gorges run, are the limestone peaks topped by snow until May that occupy much of Chania regional unit. They contain more than 40 peaks over 2,000 meters high. The highest peak in this area is Pachnes, at 2,453 meters above sea level.\n\nThe regional unit also includes three headlands, known as the \"three heads\" of Crete. From east to west, they are: Akrotiri, Rodopos (also called Spatha) and Gramvousa.\n\nWestern Crete is popular with tourists for its spring flowers that linger on into early May in the mountains. Birdwatching is also common, with the lammergeier and golden eagle especially sought for. As an island, Crete has many endemic species of plant and animal.\n\nCrete's only freshwater lake, Lake Kournas, is in the regional unit close to the border with Rethymno regional unit, 47 km from Chania. It is relatively large, with a perimeter of 3.5 km. The lake used to be called 'Korisia' after ancient 'Korion', a city thought to be in the area with a temple to Athena. The lake used to be reportedly full of eels but now is better known for its terrapins and tourists. Tavernas and pedalo rental shops line part of the shore. Chania is the regional unit of Crete that receives the most precipitation.\nThe Exkursionsflora von Kreta by Jahn & Schoenfelder has a precipitation map and text confirming that in general, western Crete, in casu Chania prefecture, has more precipitation than any other region on an average basis.\n\nThe regional unit Chania is subdivided into seven municipalities.

Set in Depression era, it is \"the tragi-comedy of Dove Linkhorn\", a naive Texan drifting from his hometown to New Orleans.\n\nAlgren noted, \"The book asks why lost people sometimes develop into greater human beings than those who have never been lost in their whole lives. Why men who have suffered at the hands of other men are the natural believers in humanity, while those whose part has been simply to acquire, to take all and give nothing, are the most contemptuous of mankind.\"\n\nIt is most often quoted for Algren's \"three rules of life\": \"Never play cards with a man called Doc. Never eat at a place called Mom's. Never sleep with a woman whose troubles are worse than your own.\"\n\nFitz Linkhorn barely managed to make a living pumping out cesspools, but his consuming vocation was \"Born Again\" preaching from the courthouse steps in 1930 Arroyo, Texas; it was a small, mostly Hispanic, and heavily Catholic town in the Rio Grande Valley. Fitz denounced all sins except drinking; because, being a drunk himself, he made sure he was both eloquently, and tastefully drunk as often as possible. He had two sons, Byron, who was weak and sickly, and Dove.\n\nDove had no education because his father had not wanted to send him to a school with a Catholic principal (And what else could there have been in Arroyo?). Instead, he was supposed to see movies with Byron to learn about life, but Dove never got to go; his brother did not have the price of a ticket. Dove got his education from the hoboes who hung around the Santa Fe tracks, telling one another what towns, lawmen, jails, and railroad bulls (deputized railroad police), to avoid.\n\nDove began hanging around the La Fe en Dios chili parlor in the ruins of the Hotel Crockett on the other side of town. The hotel was the place where Fitz had met the mother of his boys. The hotel was closed, but the seldom-visited café was run by Terasina Vidavarri, a wary woman traumatized by her marriage, aged sixteen, with a middle-aged ex-soldier who raped her with a swagger stick on their wedding night. She continued Dove's education by teaching him how to read from two books. One of the books was a children's storybook; the other was about how to write business letters. When he was old enough (to enjoy her teaching); Terasina broadened Dove's education, by her and him becoming lovers.\n\nByron blackmailed Dove into stealing from the café, and Terasina knew that Dove had taken money out of the cash register. She kicked him out, but not before he raped her. Dove then left Arroyo on a freight train in early 1931. Dove took up with a girl named Kitty Twist, a runaway from a children's home, and saved her life when she was about to fall under the wheels of a train. When they attempted a burglary in Houston, Kitty was caught. Dove got away on a freight to New Orleans. One of the first things he saw in New Orleans was a man cutting the heads off turtles that were to be made into turtle soup and throwing the bodies into a pile. Even with the heads cut off, the bodies tried to climb to the top of the pile. One turtle was able to reach the top of the pile before it slid back to the bottom.\n\n\"Dove didn't hesitate. 'I'll take the tarpon soup.' He didn't yet know that there was also room for one more at the bottom.\"\n\nIn the port city, with its many different influences and cultures, Dove experienced his most interesting adventures. He worked as a painter on a steamship (but did not paint anything), fooled a prostitute who was trying to rob him, sold coffeepots and \"beauty certificates\" (which supposedly entitled the bearer to a treatment at a beauty shop) while seducing the women to whom he was selling, and, in his most memorable escapade, worked in a condom factory. The condoms, which were called O-Daddies and bore interesting names and colors, were made in a house by a mom-and-pop firm, Velma and Rhino Gross.\n\nDove's lengthiest stay was with the people who inhabited the twin worlds of Oliver Finnerty's brothel and Doc Dockery's speakeasy. In the brothel he found, in addition to his old friend Kitty Twist, who had become a prostitute, Hallie Breedlove, a onetime schoolteacher who was the star of Finnerty's string of girls. Hallie was in love with Achilles Schmidt, a former circus strongman whose legs had been cut off by a train. \"Legless\" Schmidt's upper body was still powerful and every day he surged into Dockery's bar with the air of one who could beat up anyone there—and he could. Dove's main job at Finnerty's was to couple with the girls in the place, who were pretending to be virgins being deflowered, while customers watched through peepholes. Hallie, who still retained vestiges of her former life as a teacher, was interested in Dove's mind and helped him to continue to learn to read. Then she left town.\n\nDove drowned his sorrow in alcohol. Finnerty fled with the money after calling the cops. Dove spent five months in jail with the colorful petty criminals of \"Tank Ten\". Once out, he ran in Dockery's bar into Schmidt, now wise to Dove's affair with Hallie. Schmidt beat Dove until he became permanently blind, then people threw out Schmidt whose platform rolled downhill to his death. Dove made his way back to his hometown for 1932, where his brother was now dead and his father now a joke, and went back to Terasina. \"If God made anything better than a girl,\" Dove thought, \"He sure kept it to Himself.\"\n\nAlgren reworked some of his material from his first novel \"Somebody in Boots\" (1935) in this later work. He also borrowed from his short stories \"Kewpie Doll\" (for the death scene of the little girl), \"Mr. Goodbuddy and the Mighty Dripolator\" (for the gift dripolator scene), \"Lovers, Sec-fiends, Bugs in Flight\" (for the jail scene with that quote), and \"The Face on the Barroom Floor\" (for the fight scene between Dove and Schmidt).\n\nAccording to Algren, the title refers to the 1952 song \"The Wild Side of Life\".\n\nIn 1962 Algren's novel was adapted for the film \"Walk on the Wild Side\", directed by Edward Dmytryk. The screenplay was written by John Fante, with Edmund Morris and Ben Hecht (the latter uncredited), and the film starred Laurence Harvey, Capucine, Jane Fonda, Anne Baxter, and Barbara Stanwyck.\n\nIn 1970, Lou Reed was approached about a project to turn \"A Walk on the Wild Side\" into a musical, a story he tells during his song of the same name on his 1978 \"\" album. The project never materialized, but he used the title for his song, \"Walk on the Wild Side\", describing the lives of the transsexuals and transvestites he saw at The Factory.\n\nIt is referred to in Hunter S. Thompson's \"Hells Angels\" (1966) in the context of the mobility of certain elements of society, like the main characters, and how the Angels are a manifestation of that principle.\n\n"}

A remastered edition was reissued in 2003 through Capitol Records.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Queensrÿche was known as The Mob, a cover band that played songs from popular heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. Their line-up consisted of guitarists Chris DeGarmo and Michael Wilton, drummer Scott Rockenfield and bassist Eddie Jackson. Without a singer, they performed several shows with Geoff Tate, who at the time was the front man of the local band Babylon, and later of Myth. Tate chose not to join The Mob, because he was not interested in performing heavy metal covers.\n\nInspired by the positive responses from their performances at local rock festivals, The Mob decided to switch from playing cover songs to writing original music. The four members, who were between 17 and 19 years old, rehearsed five days a week in the basement of Rockenfield's parents, and took on at least two jobs each to earn enough money to record a 24-track demo tape. They booked the graveyard shifts from Monday through Friday at Triad Studios in Redmond, Washington to record four songs. Tate was asked to join the band for the recording sessions, and in the same week write the lyrics to one unfinished song, which became \"The Lady Wore Black\". The whistle at the beginning of \"The Lady Wore Black\" was unintentional, as Brett Miller recalls: \"Geoff needed to set the mood, so he had the lights turned off and sang with a single candle burning in the studio. While waiting for his first verse to come up, he whistled along with the opening guitar not realizing they were taping him. He told them it was a mistake, but everyone agreed it was cool, so they kept it.\"\n\nAttempts to be signed to a label through the demo were unsuccessful. Kim and Diana Harris, the owners of Easy Street Records, ultimately offered The Mob a management contract. As the band name \"The Mob\" was not available, it was changed to \"Queensrÿche\". Kim Harris sent the demo tape and a band photo to a friend at the British music magazine \"Kerrang!\", resulting in a glowing review and causing a growing buzz in both the United States and Europe, following which the Harrises released Queensrÿche's demo tape as a self-titled EP on their independent 206 Records label in 1983. After the EP garnered international praise, receiving much airplay and selling an unusual number of copies for a small independent release, Tate agreed to leave Myth and become Queensrÿche's permanent lead singer.\n\nKim Harris convinced EMI-America A&R manager Mavis Brodey to see Queensrÿche perform as the opening act for Zebra in Portland and Seattle on June 29–30, 1983. Brodey offered Queensrÿche a contract with EMI, spanning 15 years and encompassing seven albums. To support the EP, the band toured with Quiet Riot through the south and with Twisted Sister to the East Coast and Canada, and played in Seattle opening for Dio. After the tour had ended in November 1983, the band began preparations for their first studio album, \"The Warning\".\n\nShortly after Queensrÿche were signed, EMI re-released the EP \"Queensrÿche\" to moderate success, peaking at No. 81 on the Billboard charts. \"Queen of the Reich\" was released as a single.\n\nThe 1988 reissue by EMI saw the addition of a bonus track, \"Prophecy\", which was recorded during the \"Rage for Order\" sessions in 1985–86. This song was performed live by the band circa 1983, and was included on the 1984 \"Live in Tokyo\" home video. A demo version of \"Prophecy\" appears on the soundtrack for the movie \"\", and on the deluxe edition of \"\".\n\nOn the 2003 remastered edition, tracks 5–14 were live recordings of Queensrÿche's second performance in the tour supporting \"The Warning\", held August 5, 1984 at the Nippon Seinenkan in Tokyo, Japan. The performance was previously released on VHS in 1984 as \"Live in Tokyo\", but is now out of print.\n\nIn 2005, \"Queensrÿche\" was ranked number 336 in \"Rock Hard\" magazine's book of \"The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time\".\n\nAllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia noted an \"obvious Iron Maiden influence\" and the \"'dungeons and dragons' lyrical themes\" of the EP's songs. Rivadavia praised the song \"The Lady Wore Black\" for \"display[ing] more maturity – a sign of things to come.\" Rivadavia concluded his review by saying \"this is a must-have release for Queensrÿche fans.\"\n\n\n"}

Born in Brooklyn, New York, he grew up in Manhattan near Henry Street where he would later attend class at the Henry Street Playhouse and also start his company. He was one out of five children and his mother died when he was eight years old. He was then sent to an orphanage until he was twelve. At this time his sister Ethel, who was studying dance at the time, took him to many modern dance concerts. He graduated from Samuel J. Tilden High School in 1944.\n\nLouis was discharged from the U.S. Navy in 1946 and began to live in San Francisco, California. He then enrolled at Colorado College for a summer session conducted by Hanya Holm in 1949. It was there during one of their workshops where he met Alwin Nikolais, who would later become his mentor and lifelong partner. That year he moved back to New York to pursue a Dramatic Arts degree at New York University and attend class with Nikolais at Henry Street Playhouse. Louis made his debut as the lead soloist in Nikolais’ newly formed Playhouse Dance Company (which would later be renamed the Nikolais Dance Theater). He died in New York City on February 1, 2016 at the age of 89.\n\nLouis was chosen as Associate Director to Nikolais and together they created the Nikolais/Louis dance technique, which would go on to become a major influence on modern dance and is still taught by his students. Louis founded his own company in 1968 known as the Murray Louis Dance Company. His company was then chosen to represent the U.S. State Department on a two-month tour of India in 1968. In 1972 he piloted the “Artist in School” program. He also created two works for Rudolph Nureyev which premiered on Broadway in 1978. Louis additionally worked in television in the United States and Europe. For example, in the 1960s his artistry as both a dancer and choreographer were showcased on live network television for the \"CBS Repertoire Worhshop\". In 1984 the Murray Louis Dance Company collaborated with the Dave Brubeck Quartet and had four very successful seasons, which were broadcast in the United States, Europe and Japan. Some of his choreographed works produced for television station outside of the United States include; Pulcinello for the Batsheva Dance Company on Israeli television and The Tales of Cri-Cri for Mexico City television. In July 1987 PBS televised \"Nik and Murray\", an award-winning documentary film by Christian Blackwood, in their American Masters series.\nThe Princeton Book Publishing Company released a video called \"Murray Louis in Concert\", a collection of solos in 1989.\n\nLouis also had his collection of essays, \"Inside Dance\", published by St. Martin’s Press and released a five-part film series, \"Dance as an Art Form\", which is now used as an introduction series for Educational Arts programs in the United States. A Cappella Books published his second book of essays, \"On Dance\". Louis’s and Nikolais’ dance companies merged in 1989. On May 8, 1993 Louis’s most influential mentor and partner, Alwin Nikolais, died. Louis did not dance for 2 years after Nikolais’ death. In 1995 his company performed at Carnegie Hall for 10,000 children during their “LINK” program and in 1996 he completed a five-part video series titled, The World of Alwin Nikolais.\n\nLouis had many accomplishments and received copious numbers of awards, recognitions, and honorary degrees. He received the Dance Magazine award in 1977, which was presented to him by his former dance instructor Hanya Holm. He also received a Thank You letter from President Harry Truman, the Colorado Contemporary Dance Award, two John Simon Guggenheim Fellowships and the Scripps/American Dance Festival award (June 18, 2006). In 1998, he was selected as a Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar for a “distinguished lecture” tour of twelve universities and colleges in the United States. Louis received his first Honorary Degree from Indiana University in 1970, his Honorary Doctorate of Performing Arts from Ohio University in 1999, his second Honorary Degree from Rutgers University in 2000, and his third Honorary Degree from the Boston Conservatory in 2004. In 1998 Louis started assembling his archives and they are now available at the Ohio University’s Vernon R. Alden Library in Athens, Ohio. He created more than one hundred works (including 70 ballets), performed in 20 nations and every state of the United States, and toured five continents. He is one of the few choreographers to have danced in his own creations and a variety of composers produced music for him and his performances. He also choreographed to the music of Bach, Brahms, Schubert, Stravinsky, Tchaikovsky and many others composers. Some of the companies he choreographed dances for include; the Royal Danish Ballet, the Jose Limon Company, the Hamburg Opera Ballet, the Scottish Ballet, the Berlin Opera Ballet, and the Cleveland Ballet.\n\nLouis speaking of his choreography once said, “I don’t have a style. I come out of dance itself. I operate the principles of dance the way I talk. I get a point of view. Each piece has its own identity. It’s what choreography is all about.”\n\nMurray Louis lived and worked in New York City, New York.\n\n"}

It was one of the most radical of the experimental aircraft built during World War II. Ultimately, it was unsuccessful and did not enter production.\n\nThe initial idea for the XP-56 was quite radical for 1939. It was to have no horizontal tail, only a small vertical tail, used an experimental engine, and be produced using a novel metal, magnesium. The aircraft was to be a wing with a small central fuselage added to house the engine and pilot. It was hoped that this configuration would have less aerodynamic drag than a conventional airplane.\n\nThe idea for this single-seat aircraft originated in 1939 as the Northrop N2B model. It was designed around the Pratt & Whitney liquid-cooled X-1800 engine in a pusher configuration driving contra-rotating propellers. The U.S. Army ordered Northrop to begin design work on 22 June 1940, and after reviewing the design ordered a prototype aircraft on 26 September 1940. Shortly after design work had begun, Pratt & Whitney, however, stopped development of the X-1800. The Pratt & Whitney R-2800 engine was substituted, although it was considered not entirely suitable. Although the new engine was more powerful (2,000 hp vs 1,800 hp) it had a larger diameter and required a larger fuselage to house it. This change delayed the program by five months. It was expected that the new engine would require a 2,000 lb weight increase and cost 14 mph in top speed.\nSince this tailless design was novel and considered high risk, it was decided to construct a small, lightweight plane of similar configuration for testing called the Model N-1M. In parallel with the design of the XP-56, successful flight trials of the configuration were conducted utilizing this airframe, confirming the basic layout. Two small Lycoming engines powered this aircraft. These trials confirmed the stability of the radical design and, upon review, the Army decided to construct a second prototype, which was ordered on 13 February 1942.\n\nNorthrop constructed the XP-56 using magnesium alloy for the airframe and skin, because aluminium was forecast to be in short supply due to wartime demands. At the time there was little experience with magnesium aircraft construction. Because magnesium cannot be easily welded using conventional techniques, Northrop hired Vladimir Pavlecka to develop the heliarc welding technique for magnesium alloy. (Later it was discovered that in the 1920s General Electric had already developed similar techniques.)\n\nFirst engine runs in the aircraft were conducted in late March 1943, but excessive propeller shaft flex caused the engine to fail. Pratt & Whitney did not send another engine until August, causing a five-month delay.\n\nTaxi tests of the XP-56 began on 6 April 1943 and showed a serious yaw problem. At first, it was thought to be caused by uneven wheel brakes, and considerable effort was placed into fixing this problem. Manual hydraulic brakes were installed and the aircraft flew on 30 September 1943 at Muroc Air Base in southern California. Eventually, the yaw problem was traced to a lack of aerodynamic stability, and to fix this the upper vertical stabilizer was enlarged from a mere stub, to one virtually matching the ventral unit in shape and area.\n\nAfter a number of flights, the first XP-56 was destroyed 8 October 1943 when the tire on the left gear blew out during a high-speed (~130 mph) taxi across Muroc Dry Lake. The pilot, John Myers, survived with minor injuries which he credited to his innovative wearing of a polo player's helmet. Myers was the test pilot for several of Northrop's radical designs during the war.\n\nA number of changes were made to the second prototype, including re-ballasting to move the center-of-gravity forward, increasing the size of the upper vertical tail, and reworking the rudder control linkages. This second prototype was not completed until January 1944. The aircraft flew on 23 March 1944. The pilot had difficulty lifting the nose wheel below 160 mph (257 km/h). He also reported extreme yaw sensitivity. This flight lasted less than eight minutes, but subsequent flights were longer, and the nose heaviness disappeared when the landing gear was retracted. Only relatively low speeds were attained, however. While urging NACA to investigate the inability to attain designed speeds, further flight tests were made. On the 10th flight, the pilot noted extreme tail heaviness, lack of power, and excessive fuel consumption. Flight testing was then ceased as too hazardous, and the project was abandoned after a year of inactivity. By 1946, the U.S. Army Air Forces was developing jet-powered fighters, and had no need for a new propeller-driven fighter aircraft.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is located approximately 100 kilometres south of Ottawa and is midway between Kingston and Montreal, Quebec.\n\nThe Municipality of South Dundas comprises a number of villages and hamlets, including the following communities:\n\n\nThe municipal administrative offices are located in Morrisburg.\n\nThe county was named in 1792 to honour Henry Dundas, who was Lord Advocate for Scotland and Colonial Secretary at the time. Matilda and Williamsburgh were two of Upper Canada's original eight Royal Townships. The northern portions of Matilda and Williamsburg townships were separated in 1798 to form the new townships of Mountain and Winchester within Dundas County.\n\nThe McIntosh apple was discovered and cultivated in South Dundas near Williamsburg. John McIntosh's parents emigrated from Inverness, Scotland to the Mohawk Valley in New York, and John moved to Upper Canada in 1796. In 1811 he acquired a farm in Dundela, and while clearing the land of second growth discovered several apple seedlings. He transplanted these, and one bore the superior fruit which became famous as the McIntosh Red apple. John's son Allan established a nursery and promoted this new species extensively. It was widely acclaimed in Ontario and the northern United States, and was introduced into British Columbia about 1910. Its popularity in North America and propagation in many lands attest the initiative and industry of John McIntosh and his descendants .\n\nMorrisburg took its name from James Morris, Canada's first postmaster general. Morris also played an important role in canal-building in the area.\n\nJames Pliny Whitney, Ontario's sixth premier, is buried here in the cemetery of Holy Trinity Anglican Church in Riverside Heights, just east of Morrisburg and north of County Road 2 (formerly Highway 2). Whitney was born in Williamsburg in 1843, represented Dundas County in the Legislature from 1888 to 1914 and served as Premier from 1905 to 1914.\nMorrisburg and Iroquois were partially flooded by the creation of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1958. Unlike the Lost Villages of Cornwall and Osnabruck Townships, however, the two towns were simply relocated to higher ground in the same area. There was an international design competition in 1954 to design the new Iroquois townsite. Canadian-British architect Wells Coates was among those who submitted redevelopment concepts.\n\nAn artificial lake, Lake Saint Lawrence, now extends from a hydroelectric dam at Cornwall to the control structure at Iroquois, and replaces the formerly narrow and turbulent section of river that was impassable to large vessels. It replaces, in part, the Long Sault rapids.\n\nSeveral buildings from the Lost Villages were moved to a site near Morrisburg to create Upper Canada Village, a living museum which depicts 19th century life in Upper Canada.\n\nIn 1976, stuntman Ken Carter attempted to jump a one-mile portion of the Saint Lawrence River by taking a one million dollar Lincoln Continental rocket car off an eight-storey ramp. This was billed as \"The Super Jump\". The ramp and its runway were located in a field just west of Hanes Road, South of County road 2. The ramp has since been demolished, but the concrete runway still exists as of 2012.\n\nThe municipality was established on January 1, 1998, with the amalgamation of the former townships of Matilda and Williamsburg, along with the former villages of Iroquois and Morrisburg.\n\nCharles A. Barkley, who was elected mayor of the municipality in the 2006 municipal elections, died unexpectedly on June 17, 2009. He was a municipal politician since 1981 when he joined the Township of Matilda council. He was succeeded by deputy mayor Robert Gillard.\n\nThe only provincial highway directly serving the municipality is Highway 401. All other highway routes in the municipality, including Highway 2 and Highway 31, were decommissioned by the province in the 1990s, and were folded into Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry's county road system. Highway 416, the main route from the 401 to Ottawa, has its southern terminus at \nJohnstown in the neighbouring township of Edwardsburgh/Cardinal.\n\nMorrisburg is served by a small, unattended airport adjacent to Upper Canada Village.

{"id": "2266966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2266966", "title": "Villa del Poggio Imperiale", "text": "Villa del Poggio Imperiale\n\nVilla del Poggio Imperiale (English: Villa of the Imperial Hill) is a predominantly neoclassical former grand ducal villa in Arcetri, just to the south of Florence in Tuscany, central Italy. Beginning as a villa of the Baroncelli of Florence, it was seized by the Medici, became the home of a homicidal and unfaithful husband, and a lavish retreat for a Grand Duchess with imperial pretensions. Later given to Napoleon's sister, it was reclaimed by the hereditary rulers of Tuscany before being finally converted to a prestigious girls' school. During its long history, it has often been at the centre of Italy's turbulent history, and has been rebuilt and redesigned many times.\n\nThe Villa was once the property of the Grand Dukes of Tuscany — the Medici. However, the documented history begins in the 15th century when a small villa on the site known as \"Villa del Poggio Baroncelli\", was built by the Florentine merchant Jacopo Baroncelli The villa was sold to Bartoncelliu's creditor in 1487, and in turn to Pietro Salviati in 1548. The Salviati were an ancient Florentine noble family. Pietro embellished the property, and added Andrea del Sarto's \"Assumption of the Virgin\" to the villa's chapel. In 1565 at Pietro's death the Salviati property was confiscated by Cosimo I, who gave the villa to his daughter Isabella de' Medici who was married to Paolo Giordano Orsini, duke of Bracciano, who made an occasional appearance. At this favoured retreat Isabella held her stylish and intellectual court. Following Isabella's murder by her husband in 1576, the villa passed to her son Don Virginio Orsini, duke of Bracciano.\n\nIn 1618 the villa was purchased from the Orsini by Archduchess Maria Maddalena of Austria, wife of the future Grand Duke Cosimo II, and was completely rebuilt between 1622 and 1625 to the design of the architect Giulio Parigi. The villa was doubled in size with a large corps de logis flanked by two canted lower wings. The interior of the villa was decorated to the Grand Duchess' requirements by the artist Matteo Rosselli. It was at this time that the Villa was linked to the city by a monumental tree-lined avenue and given its \"Imperial\" title \"Villa del Poggio Imperiale\" — Maria Magdalena was the sister of the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand II.\n\nThe building work was very costly, as was the near simultaneous work at the Palazzo Pitti. The Medicis' finances had deteriorated since the time of Cosimo the Elder, and the Grand Duke's decision to close what few branches remained of the Medici Bank at this time meant that the people of Tuscany were forced to pay increased taxes to finance the building projects. Following the death of Cosimo II and the joint regency of Maria Magdalena and her mother-in-law Christine of Lorraine, the extravagances and unprecedented luxury of the court at the Villa del Poggio Imperiale and the Palazzo Pitti severely depleted the Medici finances.\n\nIn 1659 the estate was acquired by Ferdinand II and his wife Vittoria Della Rovere, who had the Villa further enlarged and embellished with marbles and intarsia. However it was to be under the successors to the Medici, the House of Habsburg-Lorraine that the Villa was to reach its zenith.\n\nThe Villa was again redesigned and renovated in 1776 by for Leopold II. The work was prolonged over 15 years and included much stucco and plaster work to the interior. Extra wings were created and various secondary facades were redesigned in the neoclassical style; only the principal facade remained unaltered.\n\nThe Villa was always a secondary home for Tuscany's ruling families, favoured during spring and autumn. Conveniently close to the court, which resided at the Palazzo Pitti, and surrounded by an estate of 17 farms, it was a rural retreat from the city. However, it was always only one of several villas and palaces available to the Grand Ducal family, and its popularity and use waxed and waned. At the end of the 18th century, Grand Duke Ferdinand III leased the villa to King Charles Emanuel IV of Sardinia. Charles Emanuel lived here for just a month from 17 January 1799. It was at the Villa that on meeting Count Vittorio Alfieri (companion of Louise Stuart, wife of the \"Young Pretender\" Charles Edward Stuart, claimant to the British throne), Charles Emanuel uttered the much-quoted phrase \"\"Voici votre tyran!\"\" (Behold your tyrant).\n\nThe present monumental principal facade was created in 1807 for the newly elevated Grand Duchess of Tuscany, Elisa Bonaparte. The architect chosen was , who designed the great facade using drawings by Paoletti's admirer and imitator Pasquale Poccianti, an architect better known for his later work the Cisternoni of Livorno.\n\nNeoclassicism was a style which evolved as a contrasting reaction to the more ornate Baroque and Rococo styles which preceded it. It was not a trend to make pastiches of classical designs but a force creating a new form of architecture based on simple but rational forms with clear and ordered plans. Milan became the centre of Italy's neoclassical architecture. The works of Leopoldo Pollack, in particular his Villa Belgiojoso, and Giuseppe Piermarini, was similar to the neoclassicism found from London to Munich. However, in Italy, outside Milan these new ideals were often more pronounced and more severe than in northern Europe. Florence was for once the birthplace of a new architectural form, and the facades of the Villa del Poggio Imperiale are austere even by the standards of Italian neoclassicism.\n\nThe facade is severe and plain, the only variation and ornament being the five-bayed projecting central block. This block has a rusticated ground floor pierced by five arches leading to the inner courtyard. On the first floor is a glazed loggia, also of five bays. This block of only two floors crowned by a low pediment is flanked by two symmetrical wings of even greater severity. Each of two floors with a low mezzanine above are the same height as the central pedimented block, which is given extra prominence by raised parapet behind the pediment.\n\nThe severities of the exterior of the Villa were compensated for by the exuberance of the interior. A series of large salons were decorated with plaster work in the classical styles. The chapel, frescoed by Francesco Curradi, remained unaltered from the 17th century.\n\nFrom 1849 the political history of Florence and Tuscany became troubled. Leopold II, the last ruling Grand Duke, was replaced by a republican constitution. The Grand Duke, although later appointed a constitutional head of the republic, was forced to abdicate. \nOn 27 April 1859, the Grand Duchy ceased to exist and the last ruling Grand Duke of Tuscany and his family peacefully quit Florence. It had been a bloodless overthrow and the family left with \"respectful farewell greetings of the people.\" Tuscany now became part of the short lived United Provinces of Central Italy.\n\nOn 5 March 1860, Tuscany voted in a referendum to join the Kingdom of Sardinia. This was an important step in the unification of Italy (\"Risorgimento\") which was to follow shortly. In 1865, Florence became for a brief period the capital of a united Italy. The Palazzo Pitti became the Italian royal palace. The new King of Italy, Victor Emmanuel II, with many palaces at his disposal and an obligation to travel across Italy in the interests of the unification, had little need for a second large palace, such as Villa del Poggio Imperiale, in such close proximity to the Palazzo Pitti.\n\nThe unwanted and, by now, fairly neglected villa, now in the ownership of the state, became an exclusive girls' boarding school, the Istituto Statale della Ss. Annunziata. The school had been founded under the patronage of Leopold II and his wife, Maria Anna of Saxony in 1823 to provide education for the daughters of the Florentine nobility. Its original home in the \"Via della Scala\" in the centre of the city was required for government offices, so in 1865 a simple exchange was made. The school has occupied the building ever since. In January 2004, the school's use of the villa was formalized in an official government announcement that granted the school free use of the state-owned property in perpetuity. Only the state rooms, some of them with frescoes by Matteo Rosselli, are open by appointment to the public.\n\nThe only remaining part of the original 15th-century Villa di Poggio Baroncelli is the small courtyard. This, the smallest of the Villa's three courtyards, is sited immediately though the main entrance. Here, four cloister-like corridors illuminated by segmental windows provide abundant light. The corridors are adorned with antique busts placed on ledges and niches constructed in the eighteenth century. This decoration and embellishment of a substantial collection of antique busts was made by Vittoria della Rovere, who brought the sculptures to Florence to embellish the Villa.\n\nOn the first floor, one of the most prominent additions to the villa was the development of the \"Salone delle feste\", built between 1776 and 1783, and decorated with embellished stucco reliefs which are predominantly white in color.\n\nIn one of the adjacent \"Chinese\" wings, are four rooms decorated with circa 1775 Chinese hand-crafted wallpaper, which came from Canton workshops, specialized for export, and represented the important influence of the \"chinoiserie\" style then being experienced throughout Europe. The refined paintings of the China wing represent an idealized world of flowers, exotic birds and scenes of daily Chinese life, often borrowed from the period literature depicting Chinese life and culture. A fifth room contained, originally, 88 pictures (about 20 × 30 cm each) which were displayed with these various scenes from Chinese life. These probably came from a collection that was in the villa from about 1784. Today, only about twenty are displayed, with their repair and reconditioning being underway in an ongoing restoration project, which will eventually recreate their original layout.\n\nMany Chinese paintings, probably from the same source as those of the Villa, were given by Leopold II of Austria to his sister Maria Caroline, who became Queen consort, and de facto ruler, of Naples and Sicily. A portion of these painting were taken by her to Palermo where they remain today in the Royal Palace and Palazzina Cinese.\n\nThe original 1487 plan of the Poggio Imperiale bears little resemblance to the present day neoclassical layout. Originally, the building was a country manor house belonging to the Baroncelli family; this passed to the Pandolfini family, and eventually in 1622 it was sold to the Grand Duchess Maria Maddelena of Austria. This change of ownership was to mark the beginning of a slow transformation from provincial country manor to grand, imperial villa. The Grand Duchess immediately commissioned the building's \"restoration, enlargement, and embellishment.\"\n\nThe commission was granted to the architect Giulio Parigi, who between 1622 and 1625, introduced a more ornate Baroque style, and the later version of Baroque, Rococo. This was achieved with an expanded floor plan, lengthening the facades and elevations. These longer facades were in the late 18th century deprived of their Baroque ornament to create the chaste austere neoclassical architecture seen at the villa today.\n\n\"The eminent architectural historian Carlo Cresti describes Parigi's 1624 design as yielding a corps de logis flanked by two lower, symmetrical wings with terraces and semicircular concave profiles. Inside the Villa, Parigi restructured the old central courtyard and the rooms of the grand-ducal apartment, which were frescoed by Matteo Rosselli and his pupils.\"\n\nA further period of enhancement took place when the villa passed to the Grand Duchess Vittoria della Rovere who created the ground-floor rooms situated at the crest of the inner courtyard designed by Giacinto Maria Marmi. Between 1681 and 1683, the courtyard and its surrounding loggias were further re-designed by the architect Giovanni Battista Foggini.\n\nBetween 1766-1783, the architect Gaspare Paoletti, during the third and final renovation of the villa, accomplished the definitive restructuring of the villa to twice its previous size. Paoletti added the two flanking inner courtyards to the central courtyard, and also designed the rear facade and the great ballroom on the \"piano nobile\". This was embellished with the notable stuccowork by Giocondo and Grato Albertolli.\n\nThe principal facade, however, was not to be transformed until ownership of the villa passed to Maria Louisa of Bourbon, the Queen of Etruria, who in 1806 assigned the project to the architect Pasquale Poccianti. Poccianti extended this effort of complete neoclassical transformation (of the facade) to include a rusticated five-bay portico flanked by a theater and a chapel. The facade was completed under the eventual ownership of Napoleon's sister Elisa Baciocchi, then the Grand Duchess of Tuscany, who hired the architect Giuseppe Cacialli to freely adapt the completion of Poccianti's original plans. The free adaptation by Cacialli allowed him to supplement the original \"piano nobile\" with luminous peristyle including stuccowork and wall paintings. With the return of the House of Lorraine in 1814, the previously designed chapel and guard house were at last built, and a number of rooms were embellished by the painters Domenico Nani and Giorgio Angiolini.\n\nWith the extensive redesign and renovation in the eighteenth century, many of the original chapels in the Villa were lost. Today, only the Chapel of the Annunciation remains which the architect Giuseppe Cacialli included as part of the 1820 neoclassical renovation.\n\nThe design of the chapel is divided into three naves with a semicircular tribune. The redesign preserved the pre-existing eighteenth century decorations and embellishments which included statues of the Virtues in separate niches, as well as stucco friezes depicting biblical scenes on the walls and ceiling dome in tempura depicting the Assumption of the Virgin by Francesco Ninci.\n\nThe remarkable wealth of the works of art and opulent reliquary of priestly use held in the chapel have been expertly cataloged and documented in the short volume by Brigida D'Avanzo in Italian titled: \"Oggetti di arte sacra alla Villa del Poggio Imperiale Firenze\" in 1990. Two of the dozens of exceptional holdings in the chapel include the \"Il Ritrovamento della Croce\" of 1686 attributed to Luca Giordano, and the \"Madonna col Bambino e S. Giovannino\" of the sixteenth century attributed to the school of Puligo. A short essay in the D'Avanzo volume by Rosanna Caterina Proto Pisani documents several dozen of the objects of art held in the chapel. The extensive history of the relation of these exceptional holdings together with their cross-listing and shared use with the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, along with the art holdings identified with the Villa in general, has yet to be completely studied as a separate subject of the relation between the Villa and the Uffizi Gallery.\n\n\n\n"}

Farsala is located 38 km south of Larissa, 41 km east of Karditsa, 44 km north of Lamia and 49 km west of Volos.\n\nThe municipality Farsala has an area of 739.74 km, the municipal unit Farsala has an area of 121.433 km, and the community Farsala has an area of 57.928 km.\n\nThe Homeric Phthia of the Mycenaean period, capital of the Kingdom of the Myrmidons and of Peleus, father of Achilles, has sometimes been identified with the later city of Pharsalos (Greek: Φάρσαλος), now Farsala. A Cyclopean Wall which protected a city still exists today near modern Farsala, as does a vaulted tomb from that period.\n\nThere is a theory that claimed the existence of an earlier Pharsalos in the form of a locality identified as Palaepharsalus. This is supported by excavated remains of a fortified site called Xylades near Enipeus, which is located in the easternmost part of the Pharsalian territory. This ancient site was also associated by accounts of ancient writers with a holy place dedicated to Thetis called Thetidium. For instance, Euripides used this as a setting for \"Andromache\".\n\nThe Pharsalos of the historic era was built over a hillside of the Narthacius mountains at an elevation of some 160 m, where modern Farsala stands. It was one of the main cities in Thessaly and was the capital of the Phthian tetrarch. It was also a polis (city-state).\n\nIn the Persian Wars it sided with the Athenians. A distinctive tribe of the city was that of Echecratidon. In 455 BC Pharsalos was besieged by the Athenian commander Myronides, after his victory in Boeotia, but without success.</ref> At the commencement of the Peloponnesian War, Pharsalus was one of the Thessalian towns that sent succour to the Athenians. Medius of Larissa took Pharsalus by force, about 395 BC. Pharsalus, under the conduct of Polydamas, resisted Jason of Pherae for a time, but subsequently formed an alliance with him.\n\nIn the early 4th century BC, the city was a part of the Thessalian Commons. Later, it joined the Macedonian Kingdom under Philip II. The area became a theatre of war where the Aetolians and the Thessalians clashed with the Macedonians, especially during the Second and the Third Macedonian Wars.\n\nThe city during the classical period was influential as demonstrated in the influence wielded by the tetrach Daochos, who ruled from Pharsalos. He was part of the Council of Amphictyonic League, administered the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, and conducted the Pythian Games. Daochos built several monuments at Pharsalos dedicated to members of his family. Parts of the eight portraits that survived showed classical style, depicting subjects in their youthful vigor.\n\nIn the war between Antiochus III and the Romans, Pharsalus was for a time in the possession of the Syrian monarch; but on the retreat of the latter, it surrendered to the consul Acilius Glabrio in 191 BC.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Macedonian Kingdom, Pharsalos and the whole area became a part of the Roman Republic.\n\nThe whole area suffered great destruction during the Roman Civil War. The Battle of Pharsalus, where Julius Caesar defeated Pompey and changed the course of the Roman Republic forever, took place in 48 BC in the fields of the Pharsalian Plain.\n\nThe geographer Strabo speaks of two towns, Old Pharsalos, Παλαιοφάρσαλος (Palaeopharsalos) and Pharsalos, existing in historical times. His statement (9.5.6) that the Thetideion, the temple to Thetis south of Scotussa, was “near both the Pharsaloi, the Old and the New”, seems to imply that Palaeopharsalos was not itself close by Pharsalos. Although the battle of 48 BC is called after Pharsalos, four ancient writers – the author of the \"Bellum Alexandrinum\" (48.1), Frontinus (\"Strategemata\" 2.3.22), Eutropius (20), and Orosius (6.15.27) – place it specifically at \"Palaeo\"pharsalos. In 198 B.C. Philip V had sacked Palaeopharsalos (Livy 32.13.9). If that town had been close to Pharsalos he would have sacked both, and Livy would have written “Pharsalus” instead of “Palaeopharsalus”. The British scholar F. L. Lucas demonstrated (\"Annual of the British School at Athens\", No. XXIV, 1919–21) that the battle of 48 BC must have been fought \"north\" of the Enipeus, near modern-day Krini. It has been suggested that Krini was built on the site of Palaeopharsalos, where the old road south from Larissa emerged from the hills on to the Pharsalian Plain.\n\nIn the time of Pliny the Elder, Pharsalus was a free state. It is also mentioned by Hierocles in the sixth century.\n\nFarsala was known as \"Çatalca\" during Ottoman rule.\n\nFollowing the Treaty of Berlin the city became part of the Hellenic Kingdom together with the rest of Thessaly in 1881. During the First Greco-Turkish War (1897), a took place in the vicinity of Farsala.\n\nThe contemporary town has no historical or medieval buildings left as a result of a World War II bombardment and a catastrophic earthquake that struck the area in 1954. Small scale urbanization processes attracted population from surrounded villages during the 80's and 90's creating an urban landscape typical of Greek cities with small apartment buildings in nearby plots of land.\n\nThe municipality Farsala was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 4 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\n\nThe province of Farsala () was one of the provinces of the Larissa Prefecture. It had the same territory as the present municipality. It was abolished in 2006.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2267003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267003", "title": "Kitay-gorod", "text": "Kitay-gorod\n\nKitay-gorod (), also referred to as the Great Possad () in the 16th–17th centuries, is a cultural and historical area within the central part of Moscow in Russia, defined by the remnants of now almost entirely razed fortifications, narrow streets and very densely built cityscape. It is separated from the Moscow Kremlin by Red Square. Kitay-gorod does not constitute a district (\"raion\"), as there are no resident voters, thus, municipal elections are not possible. Rather, the territory has been part of Tverskoy District, and the Central Administrative Okrug authorities have managed the area directly since 2003.\n\nThe origins of the name \"Kitay-gorod\" are unclear. \"Gorod\" is the Russian word for \"city\", derived from the ancient \"gord\".\n\n\"Kita\" (pl. \"kity\") is a somewhat obsolete word for \"plait\" or \"an item made by braiding\". A 17th-century Russian source states \"\"У шапок янычары имели киты\"\" (\"\"U shapok yanychary imeli kity\"\"), meaning \"The Janissaries had braids hanging from their caps\". Author Robert Wallace asserts in his 1967 book \"Rise of Russia\" the term might mean a rough-hewn defensive bulwark made from woven wicker baskets filled with earth or rock – and thus \"Kitay-gorod\" means \"Basket city\". \"Kitay\" could also be derived from an old word for the wooden stakes used in construction of the quarter's walls.\n\nThe walls were erected from 1536 to 1539 by an Italian architect known under the Russified name Petrok Maly and originally featured 13 towers and six gates. They were as thick as they were high, the average being six meters in both dimensions. The last of the towers were demolished in the 1930s, but small portions of the wall still stand. One of two remaining parts of the wall is located in Zaryadye and the other near the exit from the Okhotny Ryad station of Moscow Metro behind the Hotel Metropol.\n\nRecently the mayor of Moscow announced plans for a full-scale restoration of the wall. City officials also plan to close Kitay-gorod to automobile traffic. Since 1995 the wall has been extensively rebuilt, and a new tower has been added. Inside the tower are a couple of restaurants and bars.\n\nApart from Red Square, the quarter is bordered by the chain of Central Squares of Moscow, notably Theatre Square (in front of Bolshoi Theatre), Lubyanka Square (in front of the KGB headquarters), and Slavyanskaya Square. Bourse Square on Ilyinka Street is situated entirely within Kitay-gorod.\n\nKitay-gorod, developing as a trading area, was known as the most prestigious business area of Moscow. Its three main streets — Varvarka, Ilyinka, and Nikolskaya — are lined with banks, shops, and storehouses like the historicistic shopping mall GUM which confines Kitay-gorod towards Red Square.\n\nOne of the most beautiful churches in Moscow, St. Nicholas Church on the Ilyinka (1680–89), informally known as the Great Cross, was a landmark in Kitay-gorod but was destroyed in 1933. This district also features the Church of Cosmas and Damian and the Trinity Church of Nikitniki, which today is nestled among city buildings. It was built in the 1630s on the land of Moscow merchant, Grigory Nikitnikov.\n\nNikolskaya Street is famous for being the site of Moscow's first university, the Slavic Greek Latin Academy, housed in extant Zaikonospassky monastery (1660s). Another monastery cathedral, the main church of Epiphany Monastery (1690s), stands in the middle of Kitay-gorod in the eponymous Bogoyavlensky Lane. The 18th century survives in the exterior walls of the otherwise rebuilt Gostiny Dvor (Guest Merchant's Court) by Giacomo Quarenghi.\n\nIn the 19th century, Red Square was lined by a neoclassical domed structure of Upper Trade Rows by Joseph Bove. However, in the 1890s it was torn down and replaced with the new, eclectic Upper Trading Rows (by Alexander Pomerantsev and Vladimir Shukhov) and the similar Middle Trading Rows (by Roman Klein). The rest of Kitay-gorod was densely filled with offices, warehouses and hotels, to the point where real estate developers had to build streets, not buildings – like the Tretyakovsky Proyezd project by Pavel Tretyakov and Alexander Kaminsky.\nAlso in the 1890s, developers consolidated large land lots on the perimeter of Kitay-gorod. Savva Mamontov launched an ambitious civic center, built around an opera hall, which was completed as the Metropol Hotel in 1907, the largest early Art Nouveau building in Moscow, containing artwork by Mikhail Vrubel, Alexander Golovin and Nikolai Andreev. The eastern segment (Staraya Square) was rebuilt by the Moscow Merchant Society, with the late Art Nouveau \"Boyarsky Dvor\" offices (by Fyodor Schechtel) and the neoclassical 4, Staraya Square (by Vladimir Sherwood, Jr., 1912–1914) which later housed the Central Committee of the Communist Party.\n\nThe present-day offices and clock tower of Constitutional Court of Russia were financed by the Northern Insurance Society (1910–1912) and built by Ivan Rerberg, Marian Peretiatkovich and Vyacheslav Oltarzhevsky; this project is also notable as the first professional employer of young Ilya Golosov.\n\nSince the early 1990s, many historical buildings have been torn down or rebuilt by facadist methods, tearing down everything beyond the street facade. Apart from the Gostiny Dvor, recent losses include the Tyoplye Trade Rows (Теплые ряды, demolished 1996–1997) and the recently reopened block at 10, Nikolskaya Street. The degree of destruction cannot be assessed in full, since many properties are operated by the federal government and closed to the general public.\n\nA whole quarter of Kitay-gorod adjacent to the Moskva River and known as Zaryadye was demolished in three rounds (1930s, late 1940s, 1960s), sparing only those structures that were classified as historic monuments. These include the Cathedral of the Sign (1679–84), the Church of All Saints (1680s), St. George's Church on Pskov Hill (1657), St. Maksim's Church (1698), St. Anna's Church at the Corner (1510s), St. Barbara's Church (1796–1804), the Old English Embassy (1550s), and the 16th century Romanov boyar residence. There is no other such cluster of old edifices left anywhere else in Moscow. The district's main structure, Rossiya Hotel (1967), was demolished in 2007 to make space for the new Zaryadye Park which was opened in 2017.\n"}

It is part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system and the only academic medical center for health education, research, and patient care serving Brooklyn’s 2.5 million residents. As of Fall 2018, it had a total student body of 1,846 and approximately 8,000 faculty and staff.\n\nDownstate Medical Center comprises a College of Medicine, Colleges of Nursing and Health Related Professions, Schools of Graduate Studies and Public Health, and University Hospital of Brooklyn. It also includes a major research complex and biotechnology facilities.\n\nSUNY Downstate ranks eighth nationally in the number of alumni who are on the faculty of American medical schools. More physicians practicing in New York City graduated from Downstate than from any other medical school. With 1,040 residents (young physicians in training), Downstate's residency program is the 16th largest in the country.\n\nSUNY Downstate Medical Center is the fourth largest employer in Brooklyn. Eighty-six percent of its employees are New York City residents; 68 percent live in Brooklyn. The medical center's total direct, indirect, and induced economic impact on New York State is in excess of $2 billion. SUNY Downstate Medical Center attracted close to $100 million in external research funding in 2011, which includes $26 million from federal sources. It ranks fourth among SUNY campuses in grant expenditures, and second among SUNY's academic health centers.\n\nIn 2010 SUNY Downstate celebrated its sesquicentennial, commemorating the year that the Long Island College Hospital (as it was then known) first opened its doors to students. Yet Downstate traces its roots back even further (to 1856) when a small group of physicians set up a free dispensary in Brooklyn to care for poor immigrants.\n\nKnown as the German General Dispensary, its original aim was to care for indigent Germans living in Brooklyn, but changing demographics soon required it to broaden its outreach. In 1857 it was reorganized as a charitable institution and renamed The St. John’s Hospital—the first of many name changes.\n\nOfficially chartered by the state in 1858 as the Long Island College Hospital of the City of Brooklyn, it was authorized to operate a hospital and confer medical degrees on candidates who attended two lecture courses and completed a three-year preceptorship under a practicing physician. The notion that care at the hospital bedside should be included as an essential part of medical training was revolutionary for its time, but other medical schools soon adopted the approach and it came to be regarded as essential pedagogy.\n\nIn 1860 the school officially opened its doors to 57 (male) students. It was one of only 11 medical schools to admit African American students. The first faculty included many distinguished physicians, such as Dr. Austin Flint Sr., remembered for his role in introducing the stethoscope into standard medical practice in this country. Dr. Flint delivered the commencement address on July 24, 1860, when the school graduated its first new doctors.\n\nIn the following decades The Long Island College Hospital greatly expanded both its facilities and medical school curriculum. By the time of the First World War, admission was opened to women and postgraduate training had been introduced. In 1930 the college and hospital were separated from one another so that each would be under its own governing board. The following year, the school was rechartered as the Long Island College of Medicine.\n\nIn 1945, the college purchased a large tract of land that would become the site of the future Downstate Medical Center. The “Downstate” era began on April 5, 1950, with the signing of a merger contract between the State University of New York (SUNY) and the Long Island College of Medicine. The medical center came to be known as Downstate to distinguish it from the SUNY medical center in Syracuse, New York, which is known as “Upstate”. Several years later the current campus was built in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn.\n\nIn 1954 President Dwight D. Eisenhower laid the cornerstone for the Basic Sciences Building. In the following years, the complex grew rapidly, with the addition of a student center and residence halls, as well as a nurses' residence. In 1966 Governor Nelson Rockefeller officiated at the dedication of University Hospital of Brooklyn (UHB), Downstate’s own teaching hospital. The School of Graduate Studies, the College of Health Related Professions, and the College of Nursing were established that same year. In 1987 Governor Mario Cuomo and Mayor Edward Koch helped break ground for the new Health Science Education Building, where most student classes now take place.\n\nMore recently, the medical center has entered a period of renewed growth and expansion. In addition to the completion of a multimillion-dollar capital improvement program for the hospital and new clinical and research facilities, the campus has expanded to include a Biotechnology Park and Advanced Biotechnology Incubator, and School of Public Health. The School of Public Health was structurally engineered by Leslie E. Robertson Associates, and designed by Ennead Architects.\n\nThe Advanced Biotechnology Incubator, designed for start-up and early-stage biotech companies, includes a commercial synthetic chemistry facility. Construction is underway to develop biotech research and manufacturing at the Brooklyn Army Terminal. These initiatives are part of a strategic plan to position SUNY Downstate as the center for biomedical discovery and development in Brooklyn.\n\nSUNY Downstate offers students a broad professional education that prepares them for practice or careers in any location and community. The vast majority of students are drawn from the New York City metropolitan area. Many have immigrant backgrounds and are members of racial and cultural groups who are underrepresented in the health professions. The differences in background and outlook enhance the quality of the educational experience of all students.\n\nDownstate's Colleges of Medicine, Nursing, and Health Related Professions and its School of Graduate Studies and School of Public Health collectively offer more than 30 health-focused programs.\n\nThe College of Medicine, which grants the MD degree, is the 32nd oldest college of medicine in the country. With approximately 800 enrollees, it is one of the largest colleges of medicine in New York State. It ranks eighth out of 140 accredited medical schools in the nation in the number of alumni who hold faculty positions at U.S. medical schools. More physicians practicing in New York City graduated from Downstate's College of Medicine than from any other medical school.\n\nIn addition to granting the MD degree, the College sponsors a combined MD/PhD degree with the School of Graduate Studies.\n\nOf the School of Graduate Studies' three multidisciplinary core programs, Neural and Behavioral Science is the oldest. Faculty research in the neurosciences is especially deep, ranging from the molecular to the behavioral. The Program in Molecular and Cellular Biology has concentrations in cardiovascular, fundamental cellular and molecular biology, cancer biology, and more. The Program in Biomedical Engineering, run jointly with the Polytechnic Institute of NYU, features concentrations in neurorobotics, imaging, and materials.\n\nThe School of Graduate Studies has also partnered with the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CSNE) of the University at Albany to offer a combined MD/PhD degree program in nanoscale medicine. This clinical scientist education program provides hands-on training in the development and application of nanotechnology to advance health care. MD training at Downstate is coupled with PhD training in either nanoscale science or nanoscale engineering.\n\nThe first new school established at SUNY Downstate since 1966, the School of Public Health was launched in 2001 as an MPH degree program within the Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health in the College of Medicine. In 2008 it declared school status and was fully accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health in 2010. It currently offers five master's and three doctoral programs, as well as combined degree programs.\n\nAn upper-division undergraduate and graduate school, the College of Health Related Professions has graduated close to 4,000 allied health professionals since its establishment in 1966. Approximately 80 percent of students have four-year college degrees in other fields upon enrollment. Its direct-entry midwifery program was the first of its kind in the nation.\n\nThe College of Nursing offers an undergraduate, upper-division RN-to-BS degree program for students who are already licensed as professional nurses and an Accelerated BS program for students who hold a degree in another field and seek basic preparation for beginning nursing practice. The college is one of only four nursing schools in New York State to offer master's degree programs in all advanced nursing practice roles.\n\nUniversity Hospital of Brooklyn (UHB) offers comprehensive, advanced medical care throughout Brooklyn. It includes a full-service, comprehensive hospital site (UHB at Central Brooklyn) plus a free-standing Urgent Care and Ambulatory Surgery Center in Bay Ridge and nine ambulatory satellite sites. UHB is licensed for 882 beds and annually provides care to over 300,000 patients. UHB is an 8-story facility with 8 intensive care and step-down units, 12 operating rooms, an adult and pediatric ER, diagnostic and ambulatory surgery facility, and 75 outpatient clinics. The flagship location for UHB, Central Brooklyn includes three community-based health centers in the neighborhoods of East New York, Bedford-Stuyvesant, and Midwood, plus a freestanding Dialysis Center.\n\n\nHEAT is a program established and directed by Dr. Jeffrey Birnbaum which offers culturally competent care for youth who are living at high risk of developing HIV/AIDS. HEAT has a special focus on care for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth but does not limit its services to these populations. The program offers comprehensive clinical services for HIV/AIDS patients as well as sexual health and transgender care services.\n\nHEAT is actively involved in community outreach and Dr. Brinbaum has received various awards for his efforts in combating HIV/AIDS \n\nThe Brooklyn Free Clinic (BFC) is a student-run free clinic operated primarily by the students of the College of Medicine. The BFC offers medical and psychiatric care and health maintenance screening to the uninsured populations of Brooklyn.\n\nThe clinic hosts an annual conference on health seen through the eyes of medicine, art, technology and community called BFC What's Next. The clinic has won multiple awards for its advertisement campaigns including a gold medal in conjunction with CDMiConnect at the 2014 MMM Awards for their \"We Need U\" campaign and a bronze medal at the CLIO Healthcare Awards.\n\nSUNY Downstate at Bay Ridge serves the communities of Bay Ridge/Dyker Heights, Bensonhurst, and Sunset Park. It features a walk-in Urgent Care Center, Ambulatory Surgery Center, Advanced Endoscopy Center, and Laser Vision Correction Center. It has onsite laboratory and radiology diagnostic facilities and medical offices for doctors in many clinical specialties.\n\nSUNY Downstate is an important research facility where scientists and clinicians explore many urgent health problems. Historically, areas of research strength include cardiovascular biology, neuroscience, and instrumentation. Current strengths include GABAergic inhibition, learning and memory mechanisms; pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and cardiomyopathy; robotic prosthetic devices; HIV/AIDS; pain and addiction; optical tomography imaging technology; and fundamental cell biology (mechanisms of transcription and translation).\n\nDownstate’s role as the only academic medical center in Brooklyn is central to its powerful role in clinical, translational, and public health research. Downstate’s research spans the entire “bench to bedside” spectrum as an integrated entity, bringing together basic scientists, clinical researchers, and practitioners with common interests.\n\nDownstate is the fourth highest grant recipient of SUNY’s 64 campuses. In FY 2011, sponsored research programs, including those funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), DARPA, and private foundations, totaled over $60 million. Downstate is the only healthcare facility in Brooklyn that holds the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology.\n\nIn 2013, SUNY Downstate released a court ordered financial audit which found the institution in need of capital funds citing large losses from 2007 through 2011. The audit cited bloated salaries for top administrators, underuse and poor financial decisions contributed to the losses.\n\nIn January 2020, two SUNY Downstate surgeons filed lawsuits accusing the medical center of retaliation against them for reporting patient safety and death concerns in the heart-surgery and organ-transplant programs.

The album was recorded in various recording studios in London with Pink Floyd-producer James Guthrie.\n\nIn 2013, lead singer Geoff Tate explained the band's dissatisfaction with the album's mix: \"The only time I ever experienced [a record label restricting creative freedom] was during the recording of Queensrÿche's first album, \"The Warning\". We went $300,000 over budget and the label took the record out of our hands and gave it to someone else to mix. ... The guy that mixed the album had no clue what Queensrÿche was. He never listened to hard rock music and didn't take input from anyone in the band. He just mixed it according to how he thought it should sound. No-one in the band could listen to that record. We all hated it.\"\n\n\"The Warning\" shows the band in an early stage of development, playing straight heavy metal songs unlike later albums in which more experimentation was expressed. It was a moderate commercial success in the United States, although none of the singles charted domestically. However, \"Take Hold of the Flame\" was an international hit, particularly in Japan.\n\nIn support of the release, Queensrÿche went on a worldwide tour from August 1984 through to July 1985. During the American leg of their tour, they were the opening act for Kiss on their 1984–85 Animalize Tour and Iron Maiden on their 1984–85 World Slavery Tour, while in Europe they opened for Dio on their The Last in Line tour 1984.\n\nThe album's original track sequence and sound mix that the band had approved, was changed by mix engineer Val Garay under orders from EMI-America, against the wishes of the band. This original intended sequence is identical to the final track listing but with the following exceptions: \"N M 156\" as the opening song, \"Warning\" as the second to last track, and \"Deliverance\" and \"No Sanctuary\" appearing in the opposite order. The band first learned of this in August 1984, while on tour in Japan.\n\n\n\n"}

There were competitions for professional and amateur teams. Participating nations were Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania, Switzerland and (in the final competition) Yugoslavia. Poland and Romania only competed in the amateur competition.\n\nPlayed as a league on a home and away basis, it was contested six times and each single tournament usually took more than two years to complete. The last two tournaments lasted five years. It was discontinued in 1960, when the European Football Championship started. Winners of the competition included the Austrian \"Wunderteam\" of the early 1930s, the Italy team that also won two World Cups in the 1930s, the Golden Team of Hungary and the Czechoslovakia team that later finished as World Cup runners up in 1962. \n\nThe trophy of the early competitions was named \"Švehla Cup\" after Antonín Švehla, the prime minister of Czechoslovakia, who donated it. After the Second World War the new trophy was known as the Dr. Gerö Cup in honour of Josef Gerö, a director of the Austrian Football Association and former match referee.\n\nThe competition was conceived by the Austrian football pioneer Hugo Meisl, regarded by some as one of the fathers of European football. Meisl was also behind the launch of the Mitropa Cup, a knockout competition for club teams from the same countries which also began in 1927. He also managed Austria during the \"Wunderteam\" era of the 1930s and led them to victory in the 1931-32 competition. \n\nThe first tournament played between 1927 and 1930 had been won by an Italy team inspired by Giuseppe Meazza. Meazza and Italy also won the 1933-35 competition. This time the team was coached by Vittorio Pozzo and either side of winning this competition they also won two World Cups in 1934 and 1938. The fourth tournament which began in 1936 was eventually abandoned due to the Anschluss Crisis and because of the Second World War, while a fifth tournament was not held until 1948. This tournament marked the advent of the Golden Team of Hungary, coached by Gusztáv Sebes and featuring Ferenc Puskás, Zoltán Czibor, Sándor Kocsis, Nándor Hidegkuti, József Bozsik and Gyula Grosics.

He was also Liu Bei's brother-in-law, as his sister, Lady Mi, married Liu Bei. Mi Zhu was essential to Liu Bei during the defeats of the latter, financing Liu Bei's army in critical times where there was no tax base. Mi Zhu was extremely well educated and helped Liu Bei develop relationships with wealthy rivals such as Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu and Liu Biao. He was also the elder brother of Mi Fang, who served Liu Bei as well until his defection to Liu Bei's ally-turned-rival Sun Quan in 220. Mi Zhu served Liu Bei loyally for more than 25 years, as a high civil official of Liu during all the later's tenures as governor of Xu, Jing and Yi provinces, the former's ideas were regularly and widely circulated to the common people which greatly helped Liu Bei's political movement as Han loyalist and Confucian but, historians would argue it mere rhetoric as Liu ruled more in the tradition of legalism. Nonetheless, Mi along with Jian Yong, Sun Qian, and later Yi Ji, greatly contributed to the Liu's populist movement to restore the Han dynasty through literature and essays. Mi Zhu was thought to be Liu's best friend and most favored subject, he died of illness a little over a year after Liu Bei declared himself emperor.\n\nMi Zhu was from Qu County (), Donghai Commandery (), which is present-day Lianyungang, Jiangsu. He was born in an extremely rich merchant family. According to \"In Search of the Supernatural\" () by Gan Bao (), a work largely consisting of legends and hearsays, Mi Zhu was once returning home from the capital Luoyang when he met a lady by the road. He gave her a lift out of kindness. When she alighted, she revealed that she was an emissary from Heaven on a mission to burn down Mi Zhu's house. However, to repay his kindness, she agreed to walk slowly so as to allow Mi Zhu the time to evacuate the house. A huge fire indeed broke out at noon as the lady promised.\n\nLegends aside, Mi Zhu initially served under Tao Qian, the governor of Xu Province (present-day northern Jiangsu). Upon his death, Tao Qian passed on the governorship to Liu Bei, to whom Mi Zhu thereafter rendered his service. In 196, Lü Bu seized control of Xiapi, the capital of Xu Province, and proclaimed himself the governor. Henceforth, Liu Bei was forced into exile, forming a series of temporary alliances with different warlords, including Cao Cao, Yuan Shao and Liu Biao. Throughout this trough in Liu Bei's career, however, Mi Zhu stayed loyal. When Liu Bei was defeated by Lü Bu, Mi Zhu sponsored Liu Bei with his all of his family wealth and also married his younger sister to the latter. Cao Cao had once attempted to entice Mi Zhu and Mi Fang to serve him by offering them governorships of Ying Commandery (northwest of present-day Laiwu, Shandong) and Pengcheng Commandery respectively but was turned down, and the brothers fled with Liu Bei.\n\nAfter Liu Bei conquered Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) in 214, Mi Zhu was promoted to General Who Pacifies Han (). Although he was not given any troops to command, as military manoeuver were not his expertise, he was nonetheless the most highly esteemed among Liu Bei's subjects. He was viewed as a role model official for the state of Shu and many young civil officials looked up to him as they did to Zhuge Liang, Fa Zheng, Dong He and Xu Jing.\n\nIn 219, Mi Fang defected to Sun Quan when Sun's general Lü Meng launched a surprise attack on Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan), which resulted in the death of Guan Yu. Mi Zhu bound himself and came to Liu Bei, pleading guilty for his brother's crime. Although Liu Bei did not fault him, Mi Zhu was so ashamed that he soon fell sick and died slightly more than a year later.\n\n\n"}

James Stanes was a glass and china shipping merchant who established the Stanes' presence in India by sending several of his sons to the country. In 1848, James Stanes junior (1830–1852), the second son, arrived in southern India and established the Runnymede Coffee Estate near Coonoor in Madras Presidency. He was drowned in May 1852 while traveling near Kulhutty. Later that year, following the death of James Stanes junior, William Henry Stanes (12 May 1826 – 31 January 1865), his eldest brother, was sent to India. He was followed by the fourth son, Thomas Stanes (6 January 1837 – 30 January 1905), who arrived at Madras on the SS \"Hindustan\" on 26 June 1855. James Stanes senior visited his sons William and Thomas in Madras Presidency in 1855, accompanied by his third son, Henry Thomas Stanes (1835–1917), who ran the London end of the family's businesses. The greatest impact in India was made by Robert Stanes, the youngest son, who arrived in India on 24 December 1858 on his father's ship the SS \"Trafalgar\" while still a boy of seventeen.\n\nRobert immediately launched himself on a successful career as a coffee planter in Coimbatore. Five years later he established the first inland coffee-curing plant in India, In 1885, Stanes & Co went out of business. Stanes recalled that \"the firm suffered great losses and Messrs Stanes Watson failed in business, which led to the collapse of my firm. I had to begin all over again, all that I had was 500 rupees\" (about £40 at that date). Failure in business was at that time a disgrace and Robert Stanes's son, Fred, who was five at the time, remembered both the shame and also having to return to England on a cargo boat. Stanes wrote that \"my dear wife endured it all without a murmur and with the greatest patience\". He started again and the business again prospered. By the time of his death he owned cotton mills, coffee and tea plantations, coffee curing plants, motor works and tire retreading plants; Coimbatore is still a major industrial city today, largely through Stanes's contribution.\n\nWhen Coimbatore City Council was formed, he became chairman. He set up the Stanes School in the city in 1862. His elder brother, Thomas Stanes, had established the Stanes School in Coonoor, in 1858.\n\nIn 1913, he was awarded the Kaiser-i-Hind Gold Medal for services to Coimbatore and to education and he was knighted in the 1920 New Year Honours.\n\nSir Robert died in Coimbatore in 1936 and is buried alongside his wife, Harriet Huntingdon Harris (1843–1901), at All Saints church, Coonoor.\n\n"}

It is based on Arthur Herzog's novel of the same name. The film follows a male orca whale tracking down and getting revenge on a boat captain for killing the whale's pregnant mate and their unborn calf.\n\nUpon release, the film was a minor box office success, but received mostly unfavorable reception from critics and audiences alike due to its similarities to the film \"Jaws\", released two years prior.\n\nCaptain Nolan is an Irish Canadian who catches marine animals in order to pay off the mortgage on his boat and eventually return to Ireland. Nolan's crew is currently looking for a great white shark for a local aquarium, but a scientist named Ken is targeted by the shark. An orca intervenes and kills the shark, saving Ken's life. This switches Nolan's target to the orca. Later while hunting with his crew, Nolan tries to capture what he believes to be a male orca, but mistakenly harpoons a pregnant female. Nolan and his crew get the orca on board, where she subsequently miscarries. The captain tosses the dead fetus overboard as her mate looks on, screaming in anguish.\n\nSeeking release for his near-dead mate, the male orca tries to sink the ship. One of Nolan's crew members, Novak, cuts the female off the ship, but the male leaps up and drags him into the sea too. The following day, the orca pushes his now-dead mate onto shore. Al Swain berates Nolan for his actions after finding the dead whale. Nolan denies responsibility, but Swain and the villagers eventually find out his involvement. The villagers insist that he kill the orca, as the whale's presence is causing the fish that are vital to the village's economy to migrate. The orca then terrorizes the village by sinking fishing boats in broad daylight and then breaking pipelines, thus destroying the village's fuel reserves.\n\nDr. Rachel Bedford, a colleague of Ken's and a whale expert, shows him how similar whales are to humans and tells Nolan that, \"If he (the orca) is like a human, what he wants isn't necessarily what he should have\". Nolan confesses to Bedford that he empathizes with the whale, as his own wife and unborn child had previously been killed in a car crash caused by a drunk driver. Nolan promises Bedford that he will not to fight the whale, but the orca attacks his seafront house where his injured crew member, Annie, is staying. The house starts slipping into the sea and the whale bites Annie's left leg off. Nolan decides to fight the orca, however with Novak dead, and Annie maimed and unable to help, Nolan and Paul are now the only crew members left to pursue the Orca. Bedford and Ken join the pursuit, along with a Native American man, Jacob Umilak, enlisted for his knowledge on orcas.\n\nThe crew begins to follow the whale after he signals Nolan to follow him. Ken is leaning over the side when the whale surfaces and grabs him, killing him in the process. They follow the whale until they reach the Strait of Belle Isle but when Paul starts to get into a lifeboat, the orca knocks Paul out of the boat and drowns him. The next day, the whale shoves an iceberg into the boat and starts to sink it. Nolan manages to harpoon the whale just as he and Bedford escape from the boat, however Umilak is crushed beneath an avalanche of ice just after sending out an SOS.\n\nNolan and Bedford hide on an iceberg, although Nolan slips onto another. The orca separates the icebergs, trapping Nolan. The whale jumps onto the ice, causing it to tilt and sending Nolan into the water. The whale lifts Nolan up with his tail and throws him onto another iceberg, killing him. Bedford looks on helplessly as Nolan slips into the water in a cross shape. With his revenge complete, the whale swims southward under the ice, while a helicopter is seen coming to rescue Bedford.\n\nAs the credits begin to roll, the orca is shown swimming beneath the thick Arctic ice and butting his head against it, attempting unsuccessfully to surface for air.\n\n\nProducer Luciano Vincenzoni was first assigned to give the film a head start after being called by Dino de Laurentiis in the middle of the night in 1975. Upon admitting that he had watched the film \"Jaws\", Vincenzoni was instructed by de Laurentiis to \"find a fish tougher and more terrible than the great white\". Having had little interest in sea life beforehand, Vincenzoni was directed to killer whales by his brother Adriano, who had a personal interest in zoology. Filming took place largely in Newfoundland during the fishing season. Most filming took place in the town of Petty Harbour, about 15 kilometres south of the capital city, St. John's.\n\nThe main orcas used for filming were trained animals from Marineland of the Pacific and Marine World Africa (Six Flags Discovery Kingdom), though artificial rubber whales were also used. These models were so lifelike that several animal rights activists blocked the trucks transporting them, confusing them for real orcas. The shark used early in the film was captured by noted shark hunter Ron Taylor. The scenery meant to represent a remote polar region of Labrador was fabricated in Malta by designer Mario Garbuglia. The 46-year-old Richard Harris insisted on performing his own stunts in the polar sequences and was nearly killed on several occasions.\n\nThe film grossed $3.5 million from 775 theatres in its opening weekend and went on to gross $14,717,854 in the United States and Canada.\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 10% based on 31 reviews and an average rating of 3.67/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Content to regurgitate bits of better horror movies, \"Orca: The Killer Whale\" is a soggy shark thriller with frustratingly little bite.\" A contemporary review published by \"Variety\" called the film \"man-vs-beast nonsense\", and lamented that \"fine special effects and underwater camera work are plowed under in dumb story-telling.\" Richard Schickel of \"Time\" wrote that the filmmakers behind \"Orca\" \"thumbed heavily through the literature of the sea in their search for dramatic cliches\", and called the film \"inept\" and \"suspenselessly shot\". Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" criticized the film's special effects and referred to it as \"essentially a rehash of an earlier De Laurentiis hit, \"Death Wish\", with the killer whale in Charles Bronson role.\"\n\n\"Orca\" has been unfavorably compared to \"Jaws\". Both Schickel and Arnold drew comparisons between the films, and Bob Thomas of the Associated Press called it \"just another attempt to copy \"Jaws\"\". Dave Kehr of the \"Chicago Reader\" called the film an \"incoherent blend of \"Moby-Dick\", \"King Kong\", and \"Jaws\", hindered by what appears to be extensive reediting\". However, Richard Harris enjoyed his experiences during filming and took offence at comparisons between \"Orca\" and \"Jaws\".\n\n\n"}

Characters modelled on and named after him appear in two novels by Wilson Tucker, \"To the Tombaugh Station\" and \"Resurrection Days\".\n\nOutside of science fiction, he worked as a technical writer. Coulson died on February 19, 1999, following a long illness.\n\nCoulson's novels include \"But What of Earth?\" (1976, ) (with Piers Anthony), \"To Renew the Ages\" (1976, ), and \"Lazer Tag: Adventure No 1: High Spy\" (1987, ).\nWith Gene DeWeese, he wrote two novels set in science fiction fandom, \"Now You See It/Him/Them...\" (1975, ) and \"Charles Fort Never Mentioned Wombats\" (1977, ); and two Man from U.N.C.L.E novels under the pseudonym of Thomas Stratton, \"The Invisibility Affair\" and \"The Mind-Twisters Affair\" (both 1967). Thomas Stratton may be the only author to have a book accepted and the dedication rejected (the editor thought 'To my wives and child' was too risque for the intended audience).\n\n"}

The four venues are: Academy 1, 2 and 3 and Club Academy. Utilized by the Students' Union, the venues are housed in two buildings, the original Students' Union built in 1957 and the Academy, built in 1990. In 2004, after the merging of the universities, the venues carried the \"Academy\" moniker.\n\nKnown as Victoria University, the Student Union building was erected in 1957. It began hosting concerts in 1963. The venue hosted many jazz artists in its early dates. The first performance was by Humphrey Lyttelton and His Band, 16 November 1963. The main building housed three of its original venues: the \"Main Debating Hall\" (now \"Academy 2\"), the \"Hop and Grape\" (later became known as \"Solem Bar\" and now \"Academy 3\") and \"The Cellar\" (also known as \"Cellar Disco\" and now \"Club Academy\"). Other music venues on campus were Whitworth Hall and \"The Squat\". While the Main Debating Hall hosting jazz artist, The Squat was becoming popular among international acts. After operating for eight years, the building was demolished and became a carpark. With the music scene expanding in Manchester, there was a need for a larger capacity venue on the campus, in 1984, a proposal was submitted for building a concert venue, adjacent to the original Student Union.\n\nIt opened on 18 October 1990 and was first performed in by Buzzcocks. It was closed completely between March and October 2007 when a major refurbishment and rebuilding programme began, completed in early 2008. It had had a capacity of 2000 and hosted about 50 gigs a year prior to closure, the capacity was increased to around 2,300 with the expansion and further increased to 2,600 in September 2013.\n\n\nThe following list is composed of musicians performing at either the old or new buildings, from 1963-present.\n\nFollowing the re-opening of Academy 1 in October 2007, University of Manchester Students' Union came under much criticism for large parts of the refurbishment being incomplete. Customers originally had to use portable toilet facilities outside, suffered long queues for the one small bar and had no access to a cloakroom. These problems were eventually rectified with the opening of the completely rebuilt foyer, which included a sizeable bar and VIP balcony and lounge (also open to customers with disabilities).\n\nManchester Academy has attracted positive publicity after being referred to as the UK's \"greenest venue\" with a third of the £3.5 million refurbishment budget going towards minimising the environmental impact and improving the sustainability of the reconstructed venue, as well as making substantial accommodation for disabled music fans. It also received the title of \"Best Entertainment Venue\" in the 2007 MCR Awards.\n\n"}

It consists of an inflated rubber hemisphere attached to a rigid platform. The device is often used for balance training. When the dome side faces up, the BOSU ball provides an unstable surface while the device remains stable. This combination of stable/unstable allows a wide range of users, from the young, elderly, or injured to the elite level athlete. With the dome side up, the device can be used for athletic drills and aerobic activities. The device can be flipped over so that the platform faces up. In this position, the device is highly unstable and can be used for other forms of exercise.\n\nThe name initially came from an acronym standing for \"Bionic Oscillatory Stabilization Unit (BOSU)\" - a reference to the two ways a BOSU ball can be positioned. It is also referred to as the \"blue half-ball\", because it looks like a stability ball cut in half. The acronym now favored by the creators is \"BOth Sides Utilised\" \n\nIn a scientific experiment conducted at Eastern Illinois University in 2009, 12 men performed various physical exercises (back squat, deadlift, overhead press, and curl lifts) with and without the BOSU ball. Using the BOSU ball did not create a real difference in the activity of their muscles. Therefore, it was concluded that the BOSU ball did not bring a significant improvement for these physical exercises and that these exercises performed on stable grounds were as efficient as the ones performed on the BOSU ball. A second study which concentrated on single-leg stance shows very similar results (no difference in muscle activity with and without the BOSU ball). However, an unstable surface increases activation of the rectus abdominis and allows for greater activity per exercise when compared to a stable surface. Exercises such as a curl-up on an exercise ball yields a greater amount of electromyography (EMG) activity compared to exercises on a stable platform.\n\n"}

A preview issue was released at E3 2001, with another preview issue in November 2001. The magazine was bundled with a disc that included game demos, preview videos and trailers, and other content, such as game or Xbox updates and free gamerpics. The discs also provided the software for the Xbox 360 for backward compatibility of original Xbox games for those without broadband and Xbox Live access. As of January 2012, OXM no longer includes a demo disc. In mid-2014, the U.S. version was merged into the UK version on the website, which lasted only a few months until Future plc announced that it was closing its website along with all the other websites that Future has published, including \"Edge\" and \"Computer and Video Games\". In February 2015, \"OXM\" and all of Future's video game websites were redirected into GamesRadar. \n\nThe magazine was shut down in March 2020 by owners Future Publishing, in a review of titles. Covid-19 was given as one of the reasons.\n\nOn the Disc (Discontinued in 2012)\n\nEach issue originally contained a demo disc with both Xbox 360 and Xbox Live Arcade games. However, beginning in January 2012, OXM stopped including demo discs, saying \"You've told us you don't want the DVD anymore, and we listened...\".\nEach demo contained unlockable content like gamer pics and hidden demos. There was also a sim-like game called 'OXM Universe'. Gamers played the games on disc and viewed the videos on the disc to gain points, but only 800 points were needed for the unlockable content. The points had another use in which gamers used their points to research and build equipment for the in-game game 'OXM Universe'. 'OXMU' was discontinued in OXM's 100th issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section contained Xbox business articles, gaming news, 'Hard Stuff' (a section that reviews contraptions related to an Xbox console), '2,000 Pennies or Less' (a section that showed the best cheap games that can be bought for either Xbox or Xbox 360), the codes of the month, 'Forza Showroom' (a brief column that showed some of the best \"Forza Motorsport 2\" car designs that people have made), a section for competing against the OXM crew in games like \"Lost Planet\", \"Halo 3\", \"Gears of War\", and more, 'Media Ho!' (a section that talked about movies, books, and other items related to games), 'Live Space' (a section which showed gamers' Xbox Live gamertags, 'Ask Dr. Gamer' (a section in which gamers would ask Health doctor, Freddy Chen, gaming related information), and 'The (insert something here) of Xbox' (a section that talked about business and other things of the Xbox gaming world. The column 'The Business of Xbox' was written by Geoff Keighley through the May 2007 issue, but until 2015, the column was written, on a less frequent basis, by Chris Morris (columnist). As of Issue #71, the end page rotated columnists, with guests including game creators Tim Schafer, Denis Dyack, and Randy Pitchford.\n\nUK and US Edition\n\nUntil issue #52, the \"Official Xbox Magazine (OXM)\" used a 100-point system, scoring games out of 10.0 with .1 increments. The games that received at least a 9.0 were given an Editor's Choice award. Beginning with issue #53 (Holiday 2005), the US \"OXM\" switched to a 20-point scoring system, scoring games out of 10.0 with increments of 0.5. The UK edition though switched to a 10-point scoring system, scoring games out of 10. This ratings scale was detailed on the introduction page to every issue's review section. A score of 10.0 was not considered perfect, but is called \"Classic\" and is considered to be \"one of those rare and very best of games.\" \"OXM\"'s review scale did include a score of 11.0 (termed \"Mecha Godzilla's Choice\") as \"Perfect,\" however the description for that score was \"The unicorn. Will never happen. Never.\"\n\nTwenty games received a 10/10 score from OXM, but only \"BioShock\", \"\" and \"Grand Theft Auto V\" had been given this score by both the US and UK editions. The nine 10/10 games from the US edition included: \"Fight Night Round 3\", \"Gears of War\", \"Fallout 3\", \"Halo 3\", \"\", \"Mass Effect\", \"Gears of War 3\" and \"\". Whereas the nine 10/10 games from the UK edition included: \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", \"Project Gotham Racing 4\", \"\", \"\", \"Mass Effect 2\", \"\", \"Portal 2\", \"\" and \"Mass Effect 3\".\n\n\"OXM\" also had begun reviewing Xbox Live Downloadable Content (DLC), on a three-point scale: Buy, Fanboys Only, and Deny. The exception was \"\" expansion pack in issue 70, which, due to the game's size, being \"much more than a simple map pack\" was reviewed on the normal 20-point scale, receiving an 8.5 (Great). (The game was later released as an expansion on DVD.)\n\nSome disks came with additional material for Xbox games. Early issues' demo disk included a costume expansion to \"Dead or Alive 3\" and Easter eggs unlockable via inputting a code via the controller. Some material seen only available for download on Xbox Live was included on demo disks. Until 2015, most US demo discs included gamer pics centered on a game.\n\n\nKOXM was the weekly Official Xbox Magazine podcast, hosted by OXM Senior Editor Dave Rudden. The show was previously hosted by Ryan McCaffrey until he left Official Xbox Magazine to work at IGN. Dan Amrich used to be a McCaffrey's co-host, but he left the magazine and podcast to work at Activision/Blizzard. The audio podcast featured a recap in the week's past events and game releases, two trivia contests (\"Name That Xbox Sound Effect\" and \"Stick it to the Dan\" (formerly Dan's Useless Trivia)) for a prize (usually a tee shirt or Xbox Live Arcade game), and developer interviews. The show was produced by Andy Bauman.\n\nUntil 2015, the OXM Video Podcast was updated much less frequently, with gaps over a month or more. The video podcast slowed until it was picked up again in the form of Inside Xbox, a short Xbox Live program that OXM became a part of in 2008. The OXM Report on Inside Xbox featured similar video content to the original video podcast, but with more timely information on games such as \"Gears of War 2\" and \"Mirror's Edge\" It was posted on Xbox Live every other Sunday.\n\nOn October 12, 2007, the UK edition was awarded 'Best Xbox Magazine' at the Games Media Awards.\n\n"}

The album was re-released on May 6, 2003 with four bonus tracks.\n\n\"Rage for Order\" was more progressive than the band's previous releases, with a layered and complex musical structure that employs a two-guitar approach, but also brought keyboards forward in the mix. Lyrically, the album explored social/personal, political and technological themes, among others highlighting the dangers of artificial intelligence and government intrusion. The concept of robotics would also be emphasized through the use of staccato rhythms and vocal effects such as a reverse echo.\n\nThe band's management insisted on Queensrÿche taking an image associated more with glam rock, glam metal or gothic metal. As a result, the promo photos and album artwork depicted the band members wearing trench coats, heavy make-up and perms.\n\nThe cover of the Dalbello song \"Gonna Get Close to You\" was chosen as the album's first single.\n\nThe tour supporting \"Rage for Order\" spanned approximately seven months and included being the opening act for Ratt, AC/DC, Bon Jovi and Ozzy Osbourne, although their music wasn't quite compatible.\n\nSome tracks recorded during the sessions for \"Rage for Order\" were not used on the album. \"Prophecy\" was released as the B-side of \"Gonna Get Close to You\" and later included on the 1989 re-issue of the \"Queensrÿche\" EP. Other songs such as \"From the Darkside\" and \"The Dream\" remained demos. The band had also written \"Rage for Order\" as a title track. Although it was not included on the album, the main riff from this song was worked into an instrumental piece played during some shows on the tour in support of this album, and eventually morphed into the track \"Anarchy-X\" on the \"\" album, released in 1988.\n\n\"Rage for Order\" was the first album cover of Queensrÿche to prominently feature the band's Tri-Ryche logo, as nearly all later album covers would, each time with subtle changes made to the logo. Although not credited, the front cover was designed by the late English-born metal and rock journalist Garry Sharpe-Young, who later also founded MusicMight. It had originally been proposed for a 12\" picture disc, which never materialized, but was used by EMI-America without permission for the album cover. A few thousand initial copies bear a bluish-silver banner that was later changed to black, in order to make the artist and title easier to read. The original cassette edition also had all the gold accents on the cover changed to white. CDs bearing the blue ring cover are even more rare. Only a few hundred copies were printed before the ring was switched to black.\n\nDespite the bands emphasis on keyboards and digital technology tricks such as the \"reverse echo\" this album was recorded and mixed in analog. On a short television documentary which aired in 1986, Scott Rockenfield stated that the drums were recorded in a stone warehouse using Le Mobile recording studios. Michael Wilton said that to get a guitar sound that they were happy with they \"used two old Marshall's that were on the verge of exploding\" by using a Variac causing the transformers to work harder.\n\nIn 2005, \"Rage for Order\" was ranked number 343 in \"Rock Hard\" magazine's book of \"The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Rage for Order\" was ranked No. 88 on \"Kerrang!\" magazine's \"100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums Of All Time\" in January 1989.\n"}

The CEC was founded in 1959 and has offices in Brussels and Strasbourg.\nCEC assemblies take place once every five years. The 4th CEC assembly (1964) had to be held on a ship on the Baltic Sea owing to the difficulties of obtaining visas for delegates from eastern European countries.\n\n\nUntil 2013, the CEC was governed by an annual Central Committee meeting between assemblies. The 12th Assembly of the Conference of European Churches (Trondheim, 2003) elected the 40-member Committee. This Committee, according to the CEC Constitution, was \"empowered to conduct the business of the Conference when the Assembly is not meeting\". At the 14th CEC Assembly (Budapest 2013) the Central Committee was replaced by a 20-member Governing Board. The Governing Board meets twice annually to oversee the implementation of the decisions of the Assembly. (art. 6.1) Recent meetings of the Central Committee took place in Geneva (2003), Prague (2004), Crete (2005), Derry (2006) and Crete (2012).\n\nThe President of the CEC (from 2009 to 2013) was H.E. Metropolitan Emmanuel of France. He was succeeded in 2013 by Christopher Hill, a retired Church of England bishop (formerly Bishop of Guildford. On 4 June 2018, Rev. Christian Krieger, from the Reformed Church in Alsace and Lorraine was elected President, in Novi Sad, Serbia.\n\nThe longstanding membership status of the Associated Organisations from all strands of the ecumenical movement was cancelled after a controversial debate by the 14th CEC Assembly in a second vote during a closed session requested by the Evangelical Church in Germany, one of the main contributors to the CEC budget. The organisations excluded were offered a non-voting status of organisations in partnership like national councils of churches in the CEC. It is affiliated with the World Council of Churches (WCC).\n\nThe offices of the Conference of European Churches are (since 2014) based in Brussels, Belgium - formerly the offices used by the Church and Society Commission of the CEC. The CEC General Secretariat and the (former) Churches in Dialogue Commission were previously located in the Ecumenical Centre, Geneva, Switzerland - which remains also the headquarters building of the World Council of Churches. The position of the General Secretary at CEC is vacant at the moment. The former General Secretary is Fr. Heikki Huttunen from the Orthodox Church of Finland. He succeeded Rev. Dr Guy Liagre, formerly President of the United Protestant Church in Belgium and Rev. Prof. Dr Viorel Ionita who served as Interim General Secretary from 2010. The former General Secretary (2005-2010) was the Venerable Colin Williams, formerly Archdeacon of Lancaster in the Church of England; he succeeded the Rev. Dr Keith Clements.\n\nBy 2014 the two former Commissions of the CEC were fully integrated into the core work of the CEC.\n\nIn 1999 the European Ecumenical Commission on Church and Society (EECCS) merged with the CEC, becoming the CEC's Church and Society Commission. The Church and Society Commission's secretariat was located in offices in Brussels, Belgium and Strasbourg, France. The Director of the Church and Society Commission from 2002 until 2013 was the Rev. Rüdiger Noll. Recent annual plenary meetings of the Church and Society Commission have been held in El Escorial, Spain (2003), Wavre, Belgium (2004), Dunblane, Scotland (2005), Sigtuna, Sweden (2006), Etchmiadzin, Armenia (2007), Prague, Czech Republic (2008) and Nyborg, Denmark (2009). Following the 14th CEC Assembly in Budapest in 2013 the programmes of the Church and Society Commission were integrated fully into the work of the CEC, a move completed in 2014.\n\nBased in Geneva, the staff member in charge was until July 2012, Rev. Professor Father Viorel Ionita, of the Romanian Orthodox Church. The new General Secretary of the CEC, Rev. Dr Guy Liagre succeeded him from 2012. From 2013 the work of the Churches in Dialogue Commission has been fully integrated in the work on ecumenical relations led by the CEC General Secretary.\n\nThe largest Christian body, the Roman Catholic Church, is not a member of the CEC for the same reasons that it abstains from officially participating in the World Council of Churches, which is that such organizations do not recognize any kind of Roman Catholic primacy in the governance of the universal Church.\n\nThe Third European Ecumenical Assembly (co-organised by the CEC and the CCEE) was held in Sibiu, Romania, 4–9 September 2007.\n\n\n\n"}

She is currently music director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and chief conductor of the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra. In 2020 she was elected to the American Philosophical Society.\n\nAlsop was born in New York City to professional musician parents, and was educated at the Masters School. She attended Yale University, but later transferred to the Juilliard School, where she earned a bachelor's and a master's degree in violin. While studying at Juilliard, Alsop played with orchestras such as the New York Philharmonic and the New York City Ballet. She founded the string ensemble String Fever in 1981. In 1984, Alsop founded Concordia, a 50-piece orchestra specializing in 20th-century American music. She won the Koussevitzky Prize as outstanding student conductor at the Tanglewood Music Center in 1989, where she met her hero and future mentor Leonard Bernstein.\n\nAlsop was music director of the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music from 1992 to 2016. From 1993 to 2005, she was first principal conductor and then music director of the Colorado Symphony. She is now the orchestra's conductor laureate. Alsop has also served as associate conductor of the Richmond Symphony in Richmond, Virginia from 1988 to 1990, music director of the Eugene Symphony in Eugene, Oregon from 1989 to 1996, and Creative Conductor Chair for the St. Louis Symphony from 1994 to 1996. In 2002, Alsop started the Taki Concordia Conducting Fellowship for female conductors. On September 20, 2005, Alsop became the first conductor ever to receive a MacArthur Fellowship.\n\nIn September 2007, Alsop was appointed the 12th music director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra (BSO), having been named Music Director Designate for the 2006–2007 concert season. Selecting her was noteworthy because Alsop is the first woman to hold this position with a major American orchestra. The initial controversy surrounding the announcement that she would be the BSO's next Music Director stemmed from significant resistance from the orchestra's players, who insisted they had not had enough voice in the search process. The orchestra and Alsop met after the announcement and apparently smoothed over some of their differences. In June 2009, the orchestra announced the extension of her contract for another five years, through August 2015. In July 2013, the BSO announced a further extension of her contract as music director through the 2020-2021 season. In February 2020, the Baltimore Symphony announced that Alsop is to conclude her music directorship of the orchestra at the close of the 2020-2021 season, and to take the title of Music Director Laureate.\n\nAlsop's initiatives with the Baltimore SO have included the \"Webumentary Film Series\", a free iTunes podcast, \"Clueless About Classical\", and the \"OrchKids\" programme, the last directed at underprivileged Baltimore children and based on Venezuela's El Sistema program. Alsop was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2008. In August 2015, Alsop was appointed Director of Graduate Conducting at the Peabody Institute of the Johns Hopkins University, succeeding one of her mentors, Gustav Meier.\n\nIn the UK, Alsop has served as principal guest conductor with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and with the City of London Sinfonia. Alsop was Principal Conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra (Bournemouth SO) from 2002 to 2008, the first female principal conductor in the orchestra's history. She was voted \"Gramophone\" magazine's Artist of the Year in 2003 and won the Royal Philharmonic Society's conductor's award in the same season. In April 2007, Alsop was one of eight conductors of British orchestras to endorse the 10-year classical music outreach manifesto, \"Building on Excellence: Orchestras for the 21st Century\", to increase the presence of classical music in the UK, including giving free entry to all British schoolchildren to a classical music concert. Alsop received an honorary degree of Doctor of Music from Bournemouth University on 7 November 2007. Alsop served as an Artist-in-Residence at the Southbank Centre, London, for the 2011-2012 season.\n\nIn 2012, Alsop became principal conductor of the São Paulo State Symphony Orchestra (OSESP), the first female principal conductor of OSESP. In July 2013, OSESP granted her the title of music director and in April 2015 extended her contract to the end of 2019. Alsop led the orchestra on a European tour, including its first-ever appearance at the Proms in August 2012, the first Proms appearance by any Brazilian orchestra. They returned to Europe in October 2013, with concerts in Berlin, London, Paris, Salzburg and Vienna and to the Proms in August 2016. In December 2017, OSESP announced that Alsop is to stand down as its music director in December 2019, and subsequently to take the title of honorary conductor.\n\nOn 7 September 2013, Alsop became the first female conductor of the Last Night of The Proms, and returned to conduct the Last Night on 12 September 2015. On 4 September 2014, at the Proms, she was awarded Honorary Membership of the Royal Philharmonic Society.\n\nIn 2014, Alsop first guest-conducted the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra (Vienna RSO). In January 2018, the Vienna RSO announced the appointment of Alsop as its next chief conductor, effective 1 September 2019, with an initial contract of 3 years. She is the first female conductor to be named chief conductor of the Vienna RSO. Alsop is to hold the title of chief conductor designate with immediate effect, through the 2018-2019 season.\n\nAlsop was a recipient of one of the 25th Annual \"Crystal Awards\" for 2019 at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nSince 2020 she is Artist in Residence at the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna.\n\nSince 1990, Alsop's partner has been Kristin Jurkscheit, a horn player. They have a son, and Alsop has spoken publicly about her family. While Alsop was conducting the Colorado Symphony, of which her partner was a member, their relationship provoked controversy, though Alsop replied that the relationship predated her appointment to lead the orchestra and had no bearing on her job performance.\n\nAlsop conducted her first recording in 2000 with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra in a selection of works by Samuel Barber, which was released as part of the \"American Classics Series\" on Naxos Records. This disc was followed by four more released between 2001–2004 dedicated to the works of Samuel Barber. In 2003, she released her first disc of Leonard Bernstein, recorded with the Bournemouth SO and Chorus. Following this, in 2005, Alsop’s fully staged production of Bernstein’s \"Candide\" with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra was nominated for an Emmy Award (DVD: PBS Great Performances/ Image Entertainment).\n\nIn June 2006, Alsop conducted the Baltimore SO and violinist Joshua Bell in John Corigliano's Violin Concerto \"The Red Violin\", recorded by Sony Classics and released in September 2007. She and the Baltimore SO made their first-ever live recording release for iTunes of Igor Stravinsky’s \"The Rite of Spring\". Following her advent to the Baltimore post, one of her first projects as Music Director was a series of recordings of Dvořák for Naxos. The first disc in the series, featuring Symphony No. 9, \"From the New World\", and \"Symphonic Variations\", was released in February 2008, and was nominated for \"BBC Music Magazine\"’s 2008 Album of the Year.\n\nOther recordings by Alsop with Naxos include a Johannes Brahms symphony cycle with the London Philharmonic Orchestra (the first commercially recorded Brahms symphony cycle by a female conductor), and an continuing series of Bournemouth SO recordings, which include Bartók’s \"The Miraculous Mandarin\", Bernstein’s \"Chichester Psalms\" and the symphonies of Kurt Weill.\n\nIn 2009, Alsop released a recording of Leonard Bernstein’s \"Mass\" with the Baltimore SO that earned a Grammy nomination for Best Classical Album. In 2010, her recording of Jennifer Higdon’s Percussion Concerto with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and soloist Colin Currie won a Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition.\n\nOther recent releases include Dvořák symphonies No. 7 & No. 8 with the Baltimore SO, \"Nixon in China\", and works by Roy Harris, Aaron Copland, and Barber, all on the Naxos label. In 2012, Alsop and the Baltimore SO released a recording of Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 1, also on Naxos.\n\n"}

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. It was designed by Alfred Waterhouse and completed in 1892. It was the first purpose-built building for what was to become the University of Liverpool, with accommodation for administration, teaching, common rooms and a library. The building was the inspiration for the term \"red brick university\" which was coined by Professor Edgar Allison Peers. In 2008 it was converted into the Victoria Gallery & Museum.\n\nIn 1882, University College, Liverpool, opened in a disused lunatic asylum and by 1887 it was decided that a purpose-built headquarters should be erected. Alfred Waterhouse was appointed as architect and money was raised towards the construction. Much of this was raised by a public appeal and the private donors included Henry Tate, who gave £20,000 towards the building and a further £5,500 for books in the library, and William Hartley, who paid £4,300 for the clock and bells in the tower. The builders were Brown and Backhouse and the brickwork was contracted to Joshua Henshaw and Sons. Victoria Building was officially opened in December 1892 by Lord Spencer, the Chancellor of the Victoria University.\n\nThe building housed lecture rooms, staff offices, common rooms and, on the top floor, the Tate Library. As the university grew, departments gradually moved out of the building, which became increasingly used for administration. In 1938 the Harold Cohen Library opened and the contents of the library were moved out of the Victoria Building. The former library became the Tate Hall which was used for exhibitions, formal events and as an examination room. In 1970 the administration moved from the Victoria Building into the Senate House. In 2008, to coincide with Liverpool being European Capital of Culture, the building was converted into the Victoria Gallery and Museum.\n\nVictoria Building is constructed in Ruabon brick and common brick with terracotta dressings under a slate roof. It is an L-shaped building in three stories with 13 bays facing Brownlow Hill and five bays in Ashton Street. The southerly eight bays have alternate gables and gabled dormers. The ninth bay forms the tower. It has an arched entrance over which is an oriel window and, above this a three-light window. Over this are the royal coat of arms, a mosaic panel with an inscription and machicolation. The top stage has a four-face clock. At each angle of the tower are buttresses which rise to form pinnacles with lead spirelets. Over all is a lead spire with two tiers of lucarnes. The tenth bay has staircase windows with a gable above. The end bays curve round behind an octagonal tower with a spire.\n\nThe building is fire-proof, and constructed around an iron frame, with concrete floors. Internally the entrance hall is faced in Burmantofts terracotta, which is mainly brown but with some blue. An arcaded staircase leads to the first floor which has a lecture theatre occupying the apse at the north end. The top floor consists of a large space which contained the previous library. In the entrance hall is a life-size marble statue by Albert Bruce-Joy, the University war memorial and on the stairs are memorial plaques. The clock in the tower was made by William Potts & Sons of Leeds. Also in the tower is a chime of five bells cast by Taylors of Loughborough. Each bell is inscribed with a line from Tennyson's \"In Memoriam\".\n\nThe \"Victoria Gallery & Museum\" is open to the public from Tuesday to Saturday each week and admission is free. On the ground floor is the Waterhouse Café and a shop. On the first floor is the art collection which comprises paintings, sculptures and ceramics. Artists represented include Joseph Wright of Derby, J. M. W. Turner, Jacob Epstein, Lucian Freud, Elizabeth Frink and John James Audubon. A series of special exhibitions is organised. Also on this floor is the Leggate Lecture Theatre in which educational talks are given.\n\nThe top floor comprises the \"Tate Hall Museum\" which contains exhibits on a variety of subjects, including zoology, medicine, dentistry, archaeology, engineering and oceanography.\n\n\n"}

This appearance led to small parts in television series like \"Quatermass\" and \"Hazell\", and was also noticed by the \"Coronation Street\" casting offices, who gave Ivy Tilsley, the oft-seen Baldwin's worker, a son. Quinten was then signed to the programme, for which he worked for over a decade. His pairing with Gail Potter (played by Helen Worth) proved very popular for the serial in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1989, Quinten told the casting office that he was going to move to the United States to marry his then-fiancée, American talk show host Leeza Gibbons. The couple had met in 1988 in New Zealand while appearing on a Telethon, and Quinten had been hoping to stay in Coronation Street as a part-time character, but the producers rejected his offer to stay on part-time, and at the end of 1988 the decision was made to kill the character off. His final episode was aired on 15 February 1989, when Brian Tilsley was stabbed to death by a gang of teenagers outside a nightclub.\n\nOnce settled in the United States, Quinten and Gibbons worked together on the film \"RoboCop 2\" (in which he played a reporter), and had one daughter, Lexi Quinten. The couple divorced in 1991. Quinten married Paula Holmes in 1992, but they are now separated.\n\nQuinten returned to Britain and appeared on various chat shows. In 1994, he played Mr. Barraclough in an episode of the ITV comedy series \"Surgical Spirit\". In 1998, it was reported that he was now touring the country with a one-man comedy rock act, and was also working as an after-dinner speaker. In 2000, he briefly returned to television acting with a guest role in the BBC soap opera \"Doctors\".\n\nQuinten has had a long career in pantomimes. In 2010 he played Abanazar in the Consett Empire's production of \"Aladdin\", and Ramsbottom in \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" at Oswaldtwistle Civic Theatre in 2011.\n\nHe appeared in Peter Kay's Sit Down for Comic Relief sketch alongside Rustie Lee & Bob Carolgees. In 2016 it was reported that Quinten now works at Stringfellows erotic nightclub in London.\n\nIn April 2020, he appeared in an episode of \"Hollyoaks\" as Mark Kelly.\n\nIn August 2005, Quinten was charged with rape. In June 2006, he was cleared of this charge.\n\nWith partner Alison Slater (ex-Stringfellow's dancer), he has a daughter Sydney (b. 2005).\n\nQuinten was married to American talk show host Leeza Gibbons from 1989–91.\nOn 10 June 2019, Quinten got engaged to his lap dancer girlfriend, Robyn Delabarre, on her twenty-first birthday.\n"}

{"id": "2267234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267234", "title": "Objective approach", "text": "Objective approach\n\nTaking an objective approach to an issue means having due regard for the known valid evidence (relevant facts, logical implications and viewpoints and human purposes) pertaining to that issue. If relevant valid evidence is denied, an objective approach is impossible. An objective approach is particularly important in science, and in decision-making processes which affect large numbers of people (e.g. politics).\n\nScientific progress can be regarded as a three-way contest between rival theories and a stock of evidence held in common. If rival interpretations are denied or if evidence is denied, then this impairs the possibility for rational debate and criticism, and consequently the growth of knowledge. On that ground, many scientists have proclaimed themselves in favour of freedom of thought and expression. If evidence is falsified as for example in conducting a control experiment knowledge is gained leading to the progress of an objective argument as the falsification resembles proof.\n\nIn decisions affecting large numbers of people (such as in politics) ignoring relevant evidence or alternative interpretations could lead to policies which, although perhaps well-intentioned, have the opposite effect of what was really intended.\n\nIn this context, it is often argued that although democracy might hamper swift, decisive action, it is nevertheless the best guarantee that all relevant facts and interpretations are included in the decision-making process, resulting in policies with greater long-term benefits.\n549749\n\nTaking an \"objective approach\" may not always be relevant, particularly in cases where it is impossible to be objective either because the relevant facts and viewpoints necessary are lacking, or because it is the subjective opinion or response that happens to be important. Thus it is possible to take an \"objective approach\" inappropriately in situations which call for an expression of subjective thought or feeling.\n\nSometimes it is argued that an objective approach is impossible because people will naturally take a partisan, self-interested approach.\nThat is, they will select out those views and facts which agree with their own (cf. confirmation bias). However this view fails to explain why, for example, people will do things which are not in their self-interest, based on what they believe to be an objective approach.\n\nA scientist or politician may never be \"neutral\" (they may have a vested interest in particular theories or policies) but they might also take an objective approach in the sense of remaining open to alternative viewpoints and new evidence.\n\nIn a rational discourse, such an \"open-minded\" stance is important, especially because it may not be known in advance which facts and arguments are truly relevant to resolving an issue. A \"closed\" stance would foreclose discussion and debate, usually on the assumption that the relevant facts and arguments are already known and judged.\n\nTaking an objective approach often contrasts with arguments from authority, where it is argued that \"X\" is true because an authority \"Y\" says so. The presumption is that \"Y\" is an authority capable of taking the most objective approach. But it may be necessary to evaluate the view of \"Y\" against other authorities likewise claiming to take an objective approach. This is an important aspect of academic scholarly method in the modern sense. Also, note that Wikipedia is not an uncontroversial (and some would argue not objective) source, and one should consider this when using it for research (which you should not do uncritically or unreservedly).\n\n"}

The series ran for three seasons; in the first season (1990), it aired once a week (usually on Saturday or Sunday), and in the second season (1991), the series expanded to weekdays. The show featured environmentalist themes and was recognized by the National Education Association as recommended viewing for children.\n\nThe show focused on a short purple extraterrestrial from the planet Widget who could shapeshift by spinning like a top into different forms. He and a group of young human friends - brothers Kevin and Brian, and their teenage sister Kristine - protect the natural environment from those who wish to plunder or harm it. Later on they are joined by fellow shapeshifter Half-Pint, Widget's mischievous and overly-curious cousin. Widget is frequently accompanied by the Mega Brain, an intelligent but somewhat clumsy being who appears as a floating head (with a transparent cranium) and floating hands.\n\nThe show was produced by Calico Creations to teach children about the dangers of pollution. Each episode would have Widget contending with a villain from either Earth or outer space wishing to exploit Earth's environment or natural resources, like Dr. Dante, Mega Slank, and his evil twin, Ratchet. In this respect, Widget, the World Watcher is very similar to \"Captain Planet and the Planeteers\" and \"Toxic Crusaders\", as all those heroes attempt to save the Earth from ecological disaster. As in those series, Widget occasionally fought against malicious entities spawned by copious pollution. For example, in one episode Widget battled a fellow shapeshifter; a sentient but hostile life form, disguised as a toxic ooze/slick, who was contaminating Earth's beaches and oceans.\n\nThe TV series ran for 65 episodes: 13 in the first season, 40 in the second season, and 12 in the third season.\n\nIt also aired on TVO and CFA in Canada and later on ITV, The Children's Channel, Sky One and Channel 4 in the UK, TV3 in Sweden, RTÉ1 and RTÉ2 in Ireland, Fun Channel in Chile, Bop TV, SABC1 and M-Net in South Africa, Saudi 2 in Saudi Arabia, Dubai 33 in the United Arab Emirates, KBS, KBS2 and American Forces Korea Network in Korea, UniMás in Spain, TV1 and TV3 in Malaysia, Canal+ and FR3 in France, ZBC TV in Zimbabwe, Channel One in Russia, Channel 5 in Singapore, KUAM-TV in Guam, NBC in Namibia, Swazi TV in Eswatini, TVP1, TVP2 and TVP Polonia in Poland, ProSieben and Armed Forces Network (with the original English recorded version) in Germany, IBC in the Philippines, RTB in Brunei, Canale 5 in Italy, Channel 2 in Israel and the ABC in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\"Widget\" was produced by Zodiac Entertainment, a Studio City, California-based firm backed by British media company Central Independent Television.

{"id": "2267236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267236", "title": "Mordechai Eliyahu", "text": "Mordechai Eliyahu\n\nMordechai Tzemach Eliyahu (, March 3, 1929 – June 7, 2010, on the Hebrew calendar: 21 Adar I, 5689 - 25 Siwan, 5770), was a prominent rabbi, posek, and spiritual leader. He served as the \"Rishon LeZion\" (Chief Rabbi of Israel) from 1983 to 1993.\n\nMordechai Eliyahu was born in the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem, the son of Iraqi Jewish Rabbi Salman Eliyahu, a Jerusalem Kabbalist, and his wife Mazal, who was a sister of Yehuda Tzadka. The surname was Hebraicised from Elias. He had an older brother, Naim Ben Eliyahu, a younger sister Rachel, and brother Shimon. Salman was a disciple of the Ben Ish Hai, who was Mazal's great-uncle. The family was poor, so Mordechai improvised ways in which to study, which he often did by candlelight. Salman died when Mordechai was eleven, but not before he instilled in his son a love of Torah and Kabbalah.\n\nIn his youth, Eliyahu attended Porat Yosef Yeshiva, and had the opportunity to learn from many great teachers such as Ezra Attiya, Sadqa Hussein, and the Chazon Ish. He would later come into contact with Mordechai Sharabi, Yaakov Mutzafi, and Yitzhak Kaduri. Later in life, he would go on to cultivate a unique relationship with the Lubavitcher Rebbe.\n\nAs a teenager, Eliyahu teamed up with Shabtai Yudelevitz to conduct Jewish outreach. In 1950–1951, Mordechai was among the leaders of Brit HaKanaim (Hebrew: בְּרִית הַקַנַאִים, lit. Covenant of the Zealots), a radical religious Jewish underground organization which operated against the widespread trend of secularization in the country. They torched cars of people who drove on Shabbat, and butcher shops where non-kosher meat was sold. They once plotted to toss a smoke bomb into the Knesset during a debate on drafting Orthodox women into the IDF. A member of the group was in the audience during the debate with the smoke bomb in his pocket, but lacked the opportunity to activate it.\n\nOn May 14, 1951, the group's members were arrested by the Shabak. Mordechai was sentenced to ten months imprisonment for his part in the group's deeds.\nLater in his life, he stated that even though his opinions did not change, \"The path that I chose in the past was mistaken.\"\n\nEliyahu received semicha from Sephardic Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Nissim. The latter requested from him to arrange for the reinterment of the Hida from Livorno, Italy to Israel. On May 17, 1960, the Hida was laid to rest at Har HaMenuchot in Jerusalem.\n\nThat year, he was appointed dayan in Beersheba, the youngest one in the country. He was often involved in adjudicating complicated family issues.\nEliyahu was a favorite of the Baba Sali, who lived nearby in Netivot. One day, the latter insisted Eliyahu stop whatever he was doing and come visit him for a glass of arak. Not wishing to upset the holy man, Eliyahu accepted the invitation, only to find out later that a disgruntled ex-litigant had gone to the beth din seeking to do him harm.\n\nFour years later, Eliyahu was transferred to the Jerusalem regional beth din, and later was elected to the Supreme Rabbinical Court in Jerusalem, a position he would retain during his term as Chief Rabbi of Israel and afterwards.\n\nOn March 18, 1983, Eliyahu was appointed \"Rishon LeZion\" (Chief Rabbi of Israel) at the Yochanan Ben Zakai Synagogue in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem. He served concurrently with Chief Ashkenazi Rabbi Avraham Shapira until their terms expired in 1993.\n\nDuring Eliyahu's term as Chief Rabbi, one of his focuses was on attempting to reach out to secular Israeli Jews, giving them a better understanding of Jewish customs and their importance. He traveled extensively throughout Israel and the world, often together with Shapira, emphasizing the importance of Jewish education, Shabbat observance, family purity, fighting assimilation, and making aliyah. Eliyahu showed a willingness to go to secular environments in order to connect with other Jews, occasionally lecturing in secular moshavim and kibbutzim.\n\nAfter stepping down from his official post, Eliyahu remained active, even ramping up his work for the Jewish community in Israel and the diaspora.\n\nEliyahu worked for the preservation of the Iraqi Jewish rite and the opinions of the Ben Ish Hai, and opposed the attempts of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef to impose a uniform \"Israeli Sephardi\" rite based on the Shulchan Aruch and his own halachic opinions. He published a prayer book called \"Qol Eliyahu\", based on this stance.\n\nEliyahu was one of the spiritual leaders of the Religious Zionist movement, and was an outspoken opponent of the Gaza Disengagement of 2005. He was considered somewhat controversial for his decades-long support of what some characterize as the radical right of the Religious Zionist movement. Eliyahu was a supporter of Rabbi Meir Kahane, and friendly with his family. He officiated at the marriage of Kahane's son, Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane, and delivered the eulogy at Meir Kahane's funeral. He was a long-time supporter of Jonathan Pollard, and became Pollard's spiritual mentor while the latter served in prison.\n\nDuring the Gaza disengagement, Eliyahu made statements interpreted as forbidding Orthodox Jews from participating in or facilitating the expulsion of the Jews from Gaza. Eliyahu later said he did not mean for soldiers to engage in \"active refusal\".\n\nIn January 2005, Eliyahu stated that the 2004 tsunami was (pre-emptive) \"divine punishment\" for Asian governments supporting Israel's unilateral disengagement plan.\nIn March 2006, three days before the 2006 Israeli legislative election, Eliyahu stated that it was forbidden to vote for any Israeli political party that had backed the disengagement, and stressed that anyone who voted for Kadima was \"assisting sinners\". Eliyahu stressed the importance of voting for a party committed to religious education and yeshivas, but urged against voting for those religious parties that had supported the disengagement, and called for members of the religious Shas party to repent for supporting the Oslo Accords.\n\nIn May 2007, he wrote a letter to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert which suggested \"that there was absolutely no moral prohibition against the indiscriminate killing of civilians during a potential massive military offensive on Gaza aimed at stopping the rocket launchings\". Shmuel Eliyahu explained that his father opposed a ground troop incursion into Gaza that would endanger IDF soldiers. Also in 2007, in a radio interview given to Haredi radio station \"Kol Haemet\" on the eve of Holocaust Memorial Day, when asked what was the sin of the six million Jews who perished in the Holocaust, he replied: \"Those people were innocent, but Reform started in Germany. Those reformers of religion started in Germany, and because it is said that the wrath of God does not distinguish between the righteous and the evil ones - this was done.\" \n\nIn 2008, at a service to remember the death of 8 Israeli students killed in the Mercaz HaRav massacre, he said: \"Even when we seek revenge, it is important to make one thing clear – the life of one yeshiva boy is worth more than the lives of 1,000 Arabs. The Talmud states that if gentiles rob Israel of silver, they will pay it back in gold, and all that is taken will be paid back in folds, but in cases like these, there is nothing to pay back, since as I said – the life of one yeshiva boy is worth more than the lives of 1,000 Arabs\".\n\nAt the age of 24, Eliyahu married Tzviya, the daughter of his rebbe Nissim David Azran, the founder and rosh yeshiva of Bet Shmuel Yeshiva in Nachlaot, Jerusalem. She bore him three sons; Shlomo, a lawyer;\nShmuel Eliyahu, Chief Rabbi of Safed; Yosef Eliyahu, dean of Darchei Hora'ah LeRabbanim; and Merav, a daughter.\n\nEliyahu suffered from a heart condition. On August 24, 2009, he collapsed in his home, and was rushed to the hospital while unconscious. He died on June 7, 2010, at Shaare Zedek Medical Center from complications related to his heart condition. He was 81 years old. An estimated 100,000 people attended his funeral in Jerusalem, which began at 10:00 PM on Monday, June 7, 2010. He was interred on Har HaMenuchot adjacent to the Hida.\n\nEliyahu founded the Heichal Yaakov Synagogue, named for Jacob Safra, and Darchei Hora'ah LeRabbanim yeshiva in the Kiryat Moshe neighborhood of Jerusalem, which is now headed by his son Yosef Eliyahu.\n\n\n\n"}

The invasion was a success, although the extent to which this can be attributed to the ruse is unknown.\n\nMichael was born in Aberbargoed in Monmouthshire in south Wales. Before leaving the town, he held part-time jobs as a gardener and labourer. His father Thomas, a coal miner, killed himself when Michael was 15 and his mother died when he was 31. Michael, homeless, friendless, depressed and with no money, drifted to London, where he lived on the streets. \n\nHe was found in an abandoned warehouse close to King's Cross, seriously ill from ingesting rat poison that contained phosphorus. Two days later, he died at age 34 in St. Pancras Hospital. His death may have been suicide, although he may have simply been hungry, as the poison he ingested was a paste smeared on bread crusts to attract rats.\n\nAfter being ingested, phosphide reacts with hydrochloric acid in the stomach, generating phosphine, a highly toxic gas. Bentley Purchase, coroner of St Pancras District, explained, \"This dose was not sufficient to kill him outright, and its only effect was so to impair the functioning of the liver that he died a little time afterwards\". When Purchase obtained Glyndwr's body, it was identified as being in suitable condition for a man who would appear to have floated ashore several days after having died at sea by hypothermia and drowning.\n\nBefore Michael, finding a usable cadaver had been difficult, as indiscreet inquiries would cause talk, and it was impossible to tell a dead man's next of kin what the body was wanted for. The dead man's parents had died and no known relatives were found. The body was released on the condition that the man's real identity would never be revealed. Ewen Montagu later claimed the man died from pneumonia, and that the family had been contacted and permission obtained, but neither of those claims was true.\n\nOn 30 April, Lt. Norman Jewell, captain of the submarine HMS \"Seraph\", read the 39th Psalm, and Michael's body was gently pushed into the sea where the tide, aided by the push of the submarine's propellers, would bring it ashore off Huelva on the Spanish Atlantic coast.\nAttached to Michael's body was a briefcase containing secret documents that had been fabricated by the British Security Service. The purpose was to make German intelligence (which was known to have operatives in Huelva) think Michael had been a courier delivering documents to a British general. The documents were crafted to deceive the Germans into thinking that the British were preparing to invade Greece and Sardinia, rather than Sicily, and they succeeded in doing so.\n\nMichael's body was picked up by a fisherman and he was buried, with full military honours, as Major William Martin. His grave, No.1886, is in the San Marco section of the cemetery of Nuestra Señora, in Huelva, Spain. The headstone reads:\n\nWilliam Martin, born 29 March 1907, died 24 April 1943, beloved son of John Glyndwyr Martin and the late Antonia Martin of Cardiff, Wales, Dulce et Decorum est pro Patria Mori, R.I.P.\"\n\nThe Latin phrase translates as \"It is sweet and fitting to die for one's country.\" In 1998, the British Government revealed the body's true identity. A new inscription was added to the gravestone:\n\nGlyndwr Michael Served as Major William Martin, RM\n\nA plaque commemorating Glyndwr Michael has been added to the war memorial in Aberbargoed. It is headed \"Y Dyn Na Fu Erioed\" (translation – \"The Man Who Never Was\").\n\n"}

She was named after her paternal great-grandmother, who was born Princess Elisabeth of Prussia. Her paternal aunt had the same name and was also nicknamed Ella. Elisabeth's early death was rumored to be a result of poison meant for her uncle, Tsar Nicholas II, but the court physician said she died of virulent typhoid, probably caused by her taking a drink of water from a contaminated stream.\n\nHer parents, nicknamed 'Ernie' and 'Ducky,' were first cousins who married at the instigation of their common grandmother, Queen Victoria. The marriage was an unhappy one from the start. Princess Victoria Melita was eighteen at the time of Elisabeth's birth. She was fond of Elisabeth, but found it hard to compete with Ernst's devotion to their daughter. Ernst was convinced even before Elisabeth could speak that he alone could understand her. At the age of six months, she was scheduled to move to a new nursery and her father 'consulted' her on her color preferences. He claimed that she made 'happy little squeals' when he showed her a particular shade of lilac material. Ernst then decorated her nursery in shades of lilac. He later had a playhouse built for his daughter that stood in its own garden. Adults were forbidden to enter \"much to the frustration of royal nurses and tutors, who could be seen pacing up and down impatiently outside as they waited for their high-spirited young charges to stop their games and emerge.\"\n\nMargaretta Eagar, a governess for the daughters of Tsar Nicholas II, described Elisabeth as \"a sweet and pretty child, with wide grey-blue eyes and a profusion of dark hair. She was much like her mother, not only in face, but also in manner.\" The four-year-old Elisabeth wanted a baby sister and tried to persuade her aunt and uncle to let her parents adopt one of her paternal first cousins, Tatiana or Maria. Her parents had only one other child together, a stillborn son, in 1900.\nShe was a favorite with her great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, who called the little girl \"my precious.\" Queen Victoria refused to permit the unhappily married Victoria and Ernst to divorce for the sake of Elisabeth. It was Elisabeth whom Queen Victoria asked to see first and to receive eightieth birthday greetings from in 1899. When the child heard Queen Victoria's pony cart approaching on the road below Windsor Castle, the four-year-old Elisabeth ran out on the balcony, waving and calling, \"Granny Gran, I'm here!\" Elisabeth's playfulness made the queen laugh out loud. Elisabeth's grandmother, Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, the Duchess of Edinburgh, brought five-year-old Elisabeth to see Queen Victoria on her death bed on 22 January 1901. After the queen died, the child was taken in to see her body and told that her great-grandmother had gone to be with the angels. \"But I don't see the wings,\" Elisabeth whispered. Elisabeth sat next to her second cousin, Prince Edward of York (called David by family and friends, later to become King Edward VIII) during Queen Victoria's funeral. \"Sweet little David behaved so well during the service,\" wrote his aunt Maud, \"and was supported by the little Hesse girl who took him under her protection and held him most of the time round his neck. They looked such a delightful little couple.\"\n\nIn his memoirs, written more than thirty years after her death, her father wrote of Elisabeth's \"deep sensitivity\" and \"very large heart.\" He wrote that \"I never knew a child who had so much influence on adults. Her inner personality was very strong, and she had a natural quality that protected her from being spoiled.\" In October 1901, after the death of Queen Victoria, Elisabeth's parents finally divorced. Her mother had rekindled a previous romance with another cousin, her future husband, Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich of Russia. Her father, according to letters written by her mother, had been caught cavorting with domestic servants. Her parents' divorce meant that Elisabeth divided her year between Darmstadt and her mother's new home in Coburg. Elisabeth was at first mistrustful of her mother and resented the divorce, although Victoria did her best to mend her relationship with her daughter during her visit with Elisabeth in the spring of 1902. She was only partially successful, though Victoria enjoyed turning her daughter into an outstanding horsewoman.\n\nIn his memoirs, Ernst said he had difficulty persuading Elisabeth to visit her mother. Before one visit, he found the child \"whimpering under a sofa, full of despair.\" He assured Elisabeth that her mother loved her too. \"Mama \"says\" she loves me, but you \"do\" love me,\" Elisabeth replied. Margaret Eagar thought the child's eyes were the saddest she had ever seen. \"Looking at her I used to wonder what those wide grey-blue eyes saw, to bring such a look of sadness to the childish face,\" she wrote. Eagar wondered if Elisabeth had a premonition of her own death because she often told her cousin Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia that \"I shall never see this again.\" However, despite Elisabeth's sad eyes, she was generally a sweet, happy child who was a peacemaker when her cousins had a dispute.\n\nOn 6 October 1903, Ernst hosted a large family gathering at Darmstadt for the wedding of his niece, Princess Alice of Battenberg, to Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark. A few weeks later he took Elisabeth to stay with his younger sister, Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, her husband, Tsar Nicholas II, and their family. At the imperial family's hunting lodge in Skierniewice, Poland, Elisabeth went on long walks and had picnics in the forest with her cousins.\n\nHer nanny, who called Elisabeth \"my baby,\" woke Elisabeth in the middle of the night and settled her in a window seat of the nursery so that she might look out on the game spread out upon the grounds below. One morning, the eight-year-old awoke with a sore throat and pains in her chest, which the Russian Court doctor put down to too much excitement with her cousins the previous day. Her fever rose to 104 degrees. The imperial party didn't believe her illness was a serious one and went ahead with their plans for the day and attended the theater as planned. By the evening Elisabeth was in even more severe pain and had started gasping for breath. A specialist was summoned from Warsaw. The specialist gave her injections of caffeine and camphor to stimulate her slowing heart, but without success.\n\n\"Suddenly she sat up in her bed and looked from one to the other of us with wide, frightened eyes,\" wrote Eagar. \"She cried out suddenly, 'I'm dying! I'm dying!' She was coaxed to lie down again, but remained agitated. \"The child turned to me, and said anxiously, 'Send a telegram to mama.'\" Eagar promised it would be done. \"She added, 'immediately.' ... We continued to fan the feeble spark of life, but moment by moment it declined. She began to talk to her cousins, and seemed to imagine she was playing with them. She asked for little Anastasie and I brought the wee thing into the room. The dying eyes rested on her for a moment, and Anastasie said, 'Poor cousin Ella! Poor Princess Elizabeth!' I took the baby out of the room.\" Doctors told Alexandra that the child's mother should be notified, but the telegram did not arrive until the following morning, when Elisabeth had already died. An autopsy following her death confirmed that she had died of virulent typhoid, although it was rumored she had eaten from a poisoned dish intended for the Tsar.\n\n Elisabeth's body was placed in a silver casket, a gift from Nicholas II, for the journey back to Darmstadt. Her father arranged a white funeral, with white instead of black for the funeral trappings, white flowers, and white horses for the procession. The Hessian people came out by the thousands to view the funeral procession and \"sobbed in unison so that I could hear it,\" Ernst wrote. A cousin, Kaiser Wilhelm II, expressed shock at the child's death in a letter to Tsar Nicholas II on the day after. \"How joyous and merry she was that day at Wolfsgarten, when I was there, so full of life and fun and health ... What a terrible heartrending blow for poor Ernie, who doted and adored that little enchantress!\" Elisabeth was buried in the Rosenhöhe with other members of the Hessian grand ducal family. A marble angel was later installed to watch over her grave. In a final gesture to Elisabeth and Ernst, Victoria Melita placed her badge of the Order of Hesse, granted to her upon her marriage, into Elisabeth's coffin. Ernst was still devastated by the memory of his daughter's death thirty years later. \"My little Elisabeth,\" he wrote in his memoirs, \"was the sunshine of my life.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2267305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267305", "title": "Electromagnetic suspension", "text": "Electromagnetic suspension\n\nElectromagnetic suspension (EMS) is the magnetic levitation of an object achieved by constantly altering the strength of a magnetic field produced by electromagnets using a feedback loop. In most cases the levitation effect is mostly due to permanent magnets as they don't have any power dissipation, with electromagnets only used to stabilize the effect.\n\nAccording to Earnshaw's Theorem a paramagnetically magnetised body cannot rest in stable equilibrium when placed in any combination of gravitational and magnetostatic fields. In these kinds of fields an unstable equilibrium condition exists. Although static fields cannot give stability, EMS works by continually altering the current sent to electromagnets to change the strength of the magnetic field and allows a stable levitation to occur. In EMS a feedback loop which continuously adjusts one or more electromagnets to correct the object's motion is used to cancel the instability.\n\nMany systems use magnetic attraction pulling upwards against gravity for these kinds of systems as this gives some inherent lateral stability, but some use a combination of magnetic attraction and magnetic repulsion to push upwards.\n\nMagnetic levitation technology is important because it reduces energy consumption, largely obviating friction. It also avoids wear and has very low maintenance requirements. The application of magnetic levitation is most commonly known for its role in Maglev trains.\n\nSamuel Earnshaw was the one to discover in 1839 that “a charged body placed in an electrostatic field cannot levitate at stable equilibrium under the influence of electric forces alone”. Likewise, due to limitations on permittivity, stable suspension or levitation cannot be achieved in a static magnetic field with a system of permanent magnets or fixed current electromagnets. Braunbeck’s extension (1939) states that a system of permanent magnets must also contain diamagnetic material or a superconductor in order to obtain stable, static magnetic levitation or suspension.\n\nEmile Bachelet applied Earnshaw's theorem and the Braunbeck extension and stabilized magnetic force by controlling current intensity and turning on and off power to the electromagnets at desired frequencies. He was awarded a patent in March 1912 for his “levitating transmitting apparatus” (patent no. 1,020,942). His invention was first intended to be applied to smaller mail carrying systems but the potential application to larger train-like vehicles is certainly apparent.\n\nIn 1934 Hermann Kemper applied Bachelet’s concept to the large scale, calling it “monorail vehicle with no wheels attached.” He obtained Reich Patent number 643316 for his invention and is also considered by many to be the inventor of maglev.\n\nIn 1979 the Transrapid electromagnetically suspended train carried passengers for a few months as a demonstration on a 908 m track in Hamburg for the first (IVA 79).\n\nThe first commercial Maglev train for routine service was opened in Birmingham, England in 1984, using electromagnetic suspension, and a linear induction motor for propulsion.\n\nWhen a current passes through a wire, a magnetic field around that wire is generated. The strength of the generated magnetic field is proportional to the current through the wire. When a wire is coiled, this generated magnetic field is concentrated through the center of the coil. The strength of this field can be greatly increased by placing a ferromagnetic material in the center of the coil. This field is easily manipulated by passing a varying current in the wire. Therefore, a combination of permanent magnets with electromagnets is an optimal arrangement for levitation purposes. To reduce average power requirements, often the electromagnetic suspension is used only to stabilise the levitation, and the static lift against gravity is provided by a secondary permanent magnet system, often pulled towards a relatively inexpensive soft ferromagnetic material such as iron or steel.\n\nThe position of the suspended object can be detected optically or magnetically, other schemes may sometimes be used.\n\nThe feedback circuit controls the electromagnet to try to keep the suspended object at the correct position.\n\nHowever, simply controlling the position usually leads to instability, due to the small time delays in the inductance of the coil and in sensing the position. In practice then, the feedback circuitry must use the change of position over time to determine and damp the speed.\n\nMaglev (magnetic levitation) is a transportation system in which a vehicle is suspended on a guiding rail by the principle of electromagnetic suspension. Maglev has the advantages of being quieter and smoother than wheeled transportations due to the elimination of much of the physical contact between wheels and track. Since maglev requires a guiding rail, it is mostly used in railed transport systems like trains.\n\nSince the first commercial maglev train was opened in Birmingham, England in 1984, other commercial EMS maglev train systems, such as the M-Bahn and the Transrapid have also been put into limited use. (Maglev trains based on electrodynamic suspension technology have also been developed and deployed.) With the possible exception of the 30.5 km Shanghai Maglev Train, major long-distance EMS maglev routes have not yet been built.\n\nAn active magnetic bearing (AMB) works on the principle of electromagnetic suspension and consists of an electromagnet assembly, a set of power amplifiers which supply current to the electromagnets, a controller, and gap sensors with associated electronics to provide the feedback required to control the position of the rotor within the gap. These elements are shown in the diagram. The power amplifiers supply equal bias current to two pairs of electromagnets on opposite sides of a rotor. This constant tug-of-war is mediated by the controller which offsets the bias current by equal but opposite perturbations of current as the rotor deviates by a small amount from its center position.\n\nThe gap sensors are usually inductive in nature and sense in a differential mode.\nThe power amplifiers in a modern commercial application are solid state devices which operate in a pulse width modulation (PWM) configuration. The controller is usually a microprocessor or DSP.\n\nNASA has been developing a launch aid using a magnetic levitation system to propel a spaceship. Proponents of maglev launch aid posit that it saves on design and launching costs, while providing a safer launching method.\n\n\nBOSE Electromagnetic Suspension:\n"}

The game consists of throwing wooden balls at a row of coconuts balanced on posts. Typically a player buys three balls and wins each coconut successfully dislodged. In some cases other prizes may be won instead of the coconuts.\n\nThe word \"\" in this context means to toss or throw.\n\nThe origins of the game are unclear, but early references to it appear in the late 1800s. It probably derives from the game of Aunt Sally, with coconuts being seen as an exotic prize in the late 19th century and into the 20th century. The National Fairground Archive holds a photograph of a coconut shy dating from 1890. The game is mentioned by H. G. Wells in his book \"The Invisible Man\" in 1897, by E. Nesbit in \"The Story of the Treasure Seekers\" in 1899. and by P.G. Wodehouse in his short story, \"The Purity of the Turf\". The term is first listed in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in 1903.\n\nOne theory suggests the coconut shy may have originated at the annual Pleasure Fair in Kingston upon Thames in 1867. That event took place on the town's Fairfield, not far from a coconut fibre mill on the Hogsmill river. The Surrey Comet reported how \"for the small sum of one penny, you could have three throws with sticks with the prospect of getting a cocoa nut...\". The coconuts could have come from nearby Middle Mill that advertised in the Surrey Comet as \"The Patent Cocoa Fibre Co Ltd the only cocoa nut fibre manufactory in Surrey. All descriptions of mats in cocoa nut fibre made to order wholesale\". Today the only reminder of Kingston's association with coconuts is a pub in Mill Street, which was the principal route between Fairfield and Middle Mill for several centuries. Called \"The Cocoanut\", it is not only spelled the old way but is furthermore the only pub in Britain with that name.\nHowever, there is a similar game shown in etchings by Thomas Rowlandson. 1804 \"Sketch on York Race Ground\" shows a carnival game where sticks are thrown at various shaped objects atop posts; the drawing was etched and printed in 1805 titled \"Gaffers at a Country Fair\", and a revised version was printed in 1808 titled \"Doncaster Fair the Industrious Yorkshirebites\" (source: British Museum). An image in the lower left corner of \"A Prospect of Greenwich Fair\", from Manners and Cvstoms of ye Englyshe in 1849, no 13, Getty Images, shows the same game with taller poles and the coconuts shown atop them.\n\nIn the first episode of the second season of \"Midsomer Murders\", a murder takes place at a church charity fair while Detective Sgt. Troy is shown repeatedly attempting (and failing) to win at coconut shy. At one point he finally asks the children running the game, \"Are these things nailed on!?\"\n\nThe game is celebrated in the 1944 music hall song \"I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts\", best known from recordings and performances by Merv Griffin in the 1950s. More recently the song was used by Disney in the film \"The Lion King\".\n\nIn Rumer Godden's short story \"Candy Floss,\" the titular Candy Floss is a doll who \"assists\" in running a coconut shy along with her owner. The story describes the set-up and management of an early 20th century coconut shy and life on the road as the group follows the fair in a van.\n\nOn \"The Mighty Boosh\", Howard Moon makes a joke to Vince's coconut friend, Precious, about being \"coconut shy\", in the episode entitled \"The Nightmare of Milky Joe\".\n\nIn the song he wrote as part of the \"Submarine\" OST, \"Hiding Tonight\", Alex Turner talks about playing the coconut shy, winning a prize even if it's rigged, and not knowing when to stop\n\nIn an episode of the first series of \"Downton Abbey\", Lady Mary Crawley and Matthew Crawley meet at a coconut shy at the village fair. In the eighth episode of the final season, while discussing whether the unconscious Thomas would mind if his wet clothes were removed, Mrs Hughes remarks, \"He's past minding if we put him in a shy and threw coconuts.\"\n\nIn the second episode of the second season of \"Fleabag\", a church fundraising event features a coconut shy. As Fleabag is leaving the event, she is seen carrying a coconut (presumably won from the coconut shy) before being stopped by the priest who asks for the coconut back as they are on hire. \n\nThe 1981 Squeeze song \"Vanity Fair\" contains the lyrics \"Coconut shy but vanity fair\".\n\nIn the episode \"Coconut Shy\" of \"Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,\" Mr. Bean plays a coconut shy at a funfair, but, after failing to win, he sneaks inside and finds it is a cheat.\n\nIn German-speaking countries the game of \"Dosenwerfen\" (throw cans) is popular for school parties as well as in professional stalls at fairgrounds. It involves throwing balls at stacks of empty tin cans. In France, a similar game known as \"Chamboule-Tout\" is frequently found at fun fairs.\n\n\n"}

The Jagdfaust was developed to address this problem. A 5 cm shell was mounted in a launch tube held in place by a pair of thin pins. Four such tubes were mounted vertically (to fire upward) in each wing. To ensure it would be fired at the correct time, the weapon featured a simple form of automated trigger in which an optical photocell detected the dark silhouette of an Allied bomber replacing bright blue sky and triggered the firing of the armed Jagdfaust guns. When the weapon fired, the force of the launch would break the pins holding the tube in place and the heavy tube would be ejected downward to offset the momentum of the explosive force of the shell. As a result, the plane's flight was not affected.\n\nThe Jagdfaust used a 5 cm \"Minengranate\" shell, whose thin walls traded fragmentation for additional explosives; when detonated within an aircraft with sheet metal skin, the skin would be blown off to devastating effect. The entire weapon was designed for economy. Because it was intended for short range use, the shell had an aerodynamically inefficient shape that could be easily forged or stamped. Its tolerances were loose, as its long-range accuracy was not an issue. Instead of a driving band, the shell flared at its base and was machined to engage the rifling. The launch tube was made of soft unalloyed steel since it would not need to keep its rifling over repeated firings. The shell used a simple type of fuse instead of the more complex and expensive AZ 39 Safety Fuse. It was probably shipped pre-assembled and ready to install.\n\nThe weapon system is credited with one kill: on April 10, 1945 Fritz Kelb downed an RAF Lancaster using it. Though initial results were promising, the war ended before it could see extensive deployment. It is believed only two aircraft were ever outfitted with it.\n\n\n"}

The first volume was published in the Spring of 1990.\n\nThe first volume includes a list of 2,000 mosques that he claims were built on Hindu temples, based primarily on the books of Muslim historians of the period or inscriptions found on mosques. The second volume excerpts from medieval histories and chronicles and from inscriptions concerning the destruction of Hindu, Jain and Buddhist temples. The authors claim that the material presented in the book as \"the tip of an iceberg\".\n\nThe book contains chapters about the Ayodhya debate. The appendix of the first volume contains a list of temple-destructions and atrocities that the authors claim took place in Bangladesh in 1989. The book also criticizes Marxist historians, and one of the appendices of the second volume includes a questionnaire for \"Marxist professors\", one of which the authors sent to well-known Indian historian Romila Thapar.\n\nIn August 1990, while releasing the book \"Hindu Temples – What Happened To Them\", Bharatiya Janta Party leader L. K. Advani chided Goel for using \"strong language\". There were proposals in November 1990 in Uttar Pradesh to ban the book.\n\nCynthia Talbot in 1995 claimed that Goel's list of destroyed temples is \"greatly inflated\", but also called for a systematic and unbiased study of the subject, without which it is very difficult to gauge the extent of damage wrought on Indian temples. Cynthia Talbot noted that in the decades after 1565, temple desecration were on the rise in Andhra Pradesh, which is in accord with the dates of temple destructed provided by Goel's list (in Goel's chapter \"Let the Mute Witness speak\"). Reflecting on Goel's list, Talbot states: \"Five date from the fourteenth century (phase one), six come from phase two, and nineteen date from 1565 to 1650 CE (phase three). The remaining thirty or so cases stem from the century after 1650, with a notable bunching of incidents in the late 1600s, when the Mughal empire was absorbing the former Qutb Shahi kingdom of Golconda.\"\n\nManini Chatterjee, in a review in the \"Calcutta Telegraph\", called Goel's book a \"very bad book\". Richard Eaton also criticized the book. Eaton discussed one of the cases in Goel's list of destroyed temples: \"an inscription dated 1455, found over the doorway of a tomb-shrine in Dhar, Madhya Pradesh\" which mentions \"the destruction of a Hindu temple by one Abdullah Shah Changal during the reign of Bhoja, a renowned Paramara king who had ruled over the region from 1010 to 1053\". Eaton says that the inscription is \"hardly contemporary\" and \"presents a richly textured legend elaborated over many generations of oral transmission until 1455\". He acknowledges that \"Goel does, however, consider it more likely that the event took place during the reign of Raja Bhoja II in the late thirteenth century rather than during that of Raja Bhoja I in the eleventh century.\" Richard Eaton thinks that \"we cannot know with certainty\" if the temple destruction did take place. Eaton also claimed that Goel has used \"selective translations of premodem Persian chronicles, together with a selective use of epigraphic data\". According to Vimal Yogi Tiwari, such an historical assessment as in Goel's book \"Hindu Temples\" has by and large been missing in India.\n\nGoel's book also includes an exchange of comments between Romila Thapar and Goel. Romila Thapar has criticized Goel, claiming that he does not understand how to use historical sources, without actually refuting any of the facts presented by Goel.\n\n\n\n"}

The album was planned to consist of 3 LPs and cover a broad range of musical styles.\n\"Crystal Ball\" can be traced to late 1985 with what would be Prince and The Revolution's final album, \"Dream Factory\". Since \"Purple Rain's\" release, each successive album became more of a collaborative effort between Prince and band members Wendy and Lisa in addition to full band performances on certain songs. \"Dream Factory\" evolved quickly from a 9-track single album to a double-LP with an ever-changing track list of songs. A final configuration of the album was finally decided upon and the album was mastered. But, during 1986 Wendy and Lisa had increasingly become disgruntled with Prince's decision to expand the Revolution with non-musicians Wally Safford and Gregory Allen Brooks along with the attitude that these new members brought with them. Unhappy and outspoken about their feelings, they had to be convinced to remain with the band and go on tour for that year's Parade Tour. However, Prince himself felt slighted and by the end of the tour fired most of The Revolution. Thus, the album was never released. The versions of the songs that would get an official release years later had the contributions made by Wendy & Lisa either toned down or completely removed.\n\nOnce Prince abandoned the project, he began recording a new album. He first recorded a track, \"Housequake\", in a sped-up vocal style similar to the title track of \"Dream Factory\". Pleased with the results, Prince continued to record in this style and ended up recording an entire album of songs in this new vocal style. Prince adopted the idea of releasing an album under the pseudonym \"Camille\" with no picture on the album cover to mystify the public and see if the album would stand on its own without Prince's name attached to it. The album reached the mastering stage, but as Prince continued recording songs, he felt the need to expand beyond a single album. Eventually he decided to combine various tracks from \"Dream Factory\", \"Camille\" and other newly recorded tracks into a 3-LP album called \"Crystal Ball\". Warner Bros. balked at the idea, convinced the album would not perform well as a three-album set, especially after the relatively poor sales for his previous release, \"Parade\". Warner Bros. and Prince compromised and settled on a double album. Prince added a duet with Sheena Easton, but cut seven tracks. The set was renamed \"Sign o' the Times\".\n\nThough seven tracks were cut from \"Crystal Ball\", they have all been released in some form over the years. \"Shockadelica\" was the first to be publicly released as the B-side to \"If I Was Your Girlfriend\" in 1987. \"Rockhard in a Funky Place\" was slated to be the closing track on \"The Black Album\" which was shelved by Prince in late 1987 and heavily bootlegged by fans. It finally saw a limited official release in 1994. \"The Ball\" was reworked, given new lyrics and became \"Eye No\", the opening track to 1988's \"Lovesexy\". Later in 1988, \"Good Love\" was released on the soundtrack to \"Bright Lights, Big City\". Prince released \"Joy in Repetition\" on his \"Graffiti Bridge\" soundtrack in 1990 (and many critics hailed it as the best track on the album). In 1998, Prince revived the concept of \"Crystal Ball\" with the release of a 3-CD album of the same name. The title track was the same one from the original 3-LP version; however, the set had little to do with the original concept other than the title track, a slight edit of \"Good Love\" and the fact that it contained three discs. Finally in 2001, a live rehearsal of \"Rebirth of the Flesh\" recorded with the \"Sign o' the Times\" band was released on Prince's website; however, this version had profanity edited from the lyrics. Though the studio version officially remains in the vault, it has surfaced occasionally on file sharing programs.\n\n\n"}

It has no overall winner—although American cyclist Lance Armstrong originally won the event, the United States Anti-Doping Agency announced in August 2012 that they had disqualified Armstrong from all his results since 1998, including his seven Tour de France wins from 1999 to 2005; the Union Cycliste Internationale has confirmed this verdict.\n\nThe Tour started with an individual time trial in Futuroscope (not an official prologue because it was longer than 8 km) and ended, traditionally, in Paris. The distance travelled was 3663 km (counter-clockwise around France). The Tour passed through Switzerland and Germany.\n\nBefore the race started, there were several favourites: Armstrong, after his 1999 Tour de France victory; Jan Ullrich, having won the 1997 Tour de France, finishing second in the 1996 and 1998 tours, and not entering the 1999 Tour due to an injury; and 1998 Tour winner Marco Pantani. Richard Virenque finished 8th place in the 1999 Tour despite bad preparation, and for the 2000 edition he was considered an important rider. Fernando Escartín, Bobby Julich, Alexander Vinokourov and Alex Zülle were also considered contenders.\n\n17 teams were automatically selected based on their UCI rankings. In addition, three teams were given wildcards by organisers of the Tour, Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO). Each of these 20 teams sent 9 cyclists, for a total of 180: Before the start, each rider had to do a health check. Three riders failed this health check; Sergei Ivanov, from Farm Frites; Rossano Brasi, from ; Andrei Hauptman, from ; all because they had a hematocrit value above 50%. The race thus started with 177 cyclists.\n\nThe teams entering the race were:\n\nQualified teams\n\nInvited teams\n\nThe highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 15.\n\nThe first stage was won by British cyclist David Millar, with Lance Armstrong only 2 seconds behind in second place. Of the other pre-race favourites, Laurent Jalabert, Jan Ullrich and Alex Zülle all lost less than 20 seconds. Virenque, Vinokourov and Escartin lost around 1:30 on Armstrong, while Marco Pantani lost more than 2 minutes. The next two stages were sprinter stages, both won by Tom Steels, not changing much in the overall classification. Stage 4, a team time trial, was won by the ONCE cycling team, and after that stage the top 10 included 8 ONCE cyclists, including leader Laurent Jalabert.\n\nIn stage 6, 12 cyclists broke away and kept a 7:49-minute lead, which shook up the classification. Alberto Elli, one of the escapees, took over the yellow jersey.\n\nIn stage 10, the Tour entered the mountains. The stage, which finished at Hautacam, was won by Spaniard Javier Otxoa, but Lance Armstrong finished second and took the yellow jersey, with Ullrich in second place, more than 4 minutes behind. The 12th stage, finishing on Mont Ventoux, was won by Marco Pantani, but Lance Armstrong finished second with the same time, so Armstrong increased his lead. Stage 15 was also won by Pantani, but again Armstrong gained time on second-place Ullrich, who was 7:26 behind. On the 16th stage, Armstrong had a bad day and lost time. Ullrich's gap shrunk to 5:37.\n\nOn stage 17, Erik Dekker won his third stage of the Tour. Stage 19, an individual time trial, was the last chance to change the general classification, although it was very unlikely that time trial specialist Armstrong would lose his 5:37 lead. Armstrong eventually went on to win the stage, and secured his Tour win. He maintained his lead in the final two stages.\n\nSubsequent to Armstrong's statement to withdraw his fight against United States Anti-Doping Agency's (USADA) charges, on 24 August 2012, the USADA said it would ban Armstrong for life and stripped him of his record seven Tour de France titles. Later that day it was confirmed in a USADA statement that Armstrong was banned for life and would be disqualified from any and all competitive results obtained on and subsequent to 1 August 1998, including forfeiture of any medals, titles, winnings, finishes, points and prizes. On 22 October 2012, the Union Cycliste Internationale endorsed the USADA sanctions, and decided not to award victories to any other rider or upgrade other placings in any of the affected events.\n\nThere were several classifications in the 2000 Tour de France. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\n\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\n\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either \"hors catégorie\", first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\n\nThe fourth individual classification was the young rider classification. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders under 26 years were eligible. Up until 1989 the leader received a white jersey. After 1989 the white jersey was no longer awarded, but the classification was still held. In 2000 the race organisers decided to start awarding the white jersey.\n\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time.\n\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass-start stage to the cyclist considered most combative, who wore a red number bib the next stage. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Erik Dekker won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Galibier. This prize was won by Pascal Hervé during stage 15. There was also a Souvenir in honour of Gino Bartali, winner of the 1938 and 1948 Tours, given first rider atop the Col d'Izoard on stage 14. This award was won by Santiago Botero.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The IK-2 was designed by French-trained engineers Kosta Sivčev and Ljubomir Ilić, who saw the desirability of developing a home-grown aircraft industry. A gull-wing design, it was armed with a hub-firing autocannon and fuselage-mounted synchronised machine guns. Just 12 production models were built, as the aircraft was obsolescent at the time it was brought into service in 1935, and only eight were serviceable at the time of the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. After the defeat of Yugoslavia, the remaining four aircraft were taken onto the strength of the air force of the Axis puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia, but none survived the war.\n\nIn the late 1920s, a scheme promoted by the Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force (, VVKJ) and the Royal Aero Club of Yugoslavia sent aspiring aeronautical engineers to France to develop their knowledge. It was intended that after this advanced training, they would return to Yugoslavia and be offered specialist roles in the VVKJ or in the aeronautical industry. Ljubomir Ilić and Kosta Sivčev went through this program, but when they returned to Yugoslavia, both were employed in administrative work. Frustrated by this, in 1931 they decided to design a replacement for the Czechoslovakian-built Avia BH-33E biplane fighter then in service with the VVKJ. Working in a basement in Belgrade, then in Ilić's apartment in Novi Sad, they devoted their spare time to secretly working on their design. Their original concept was for a low-wing monoplane with a retractable undercarriage, but contemporary thinking led them to modify their initial design into a strut-braced high-wing monoplane armed with a hub-firing autocannon and fuselage-mounted synchronised machine guns. The gull-wing design emphasised power and manoeuvrability over other characteristics.\n\nThe aircraft was designed around a French-made 12-cylinder Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs engine with a Hispano-Suiza HS.404 autocannon mounted between the cylinder banks of the engine and firing through the propeller hub. This powerful engine combined with the hub-firing cannon mandated the use of a metal fuselage. Other armament consisted of two synchronised French-made Darne machine guns, mounted under and to each side of the engine. The wing was braced with two struts on each side of the fuselage; the fixed conventional landing gear was spatted and mounted off the wing struts. The fixed tailwheel was also spatted. The enclosed cockpit was located behind the wing. The horizontal stabilizer on each side was braced from below with two rigid braces from the lower tailcone, and tied from above with two flying wires from the vertical stabilizer. The three-bladed propeller was manually adjustable in pitch.\n\nConsiderable work was needed to fully develop the design but, by early 1933, the two men had moved the project through the pre-project, basic aerodynamic and evaluation stages, including the building of a wooden scale model that Ilić took to Paris to test in the Eiffel-built wind tunnel. Up to this point, the two men had received no outside help, and had been forced to borrow from family to keep the project going. They then decided to approach the head of the technical department of the VVKJ, \"Potpukovnik\" (Lieutenant Colonel) Srbobran Stanojević, with their design. Stanojević was surprised but impressed with their work and an official report proposing to build the design was presented on 22 September 1933. Some senior VVKJ officers opposed the concept, as did \"Kapetan\" (Captain) Leonid Bajdak, an \"acknowledged outstanding exponent of fighter tactics\", who considered that a biplane with a engine was the ultimate in fighter design.\n\nDespite this opposition, support from Stanojević and some younger pilots meant that the concept was approved, and in 1934 a prototype was ordered from the Ikarus A.D. factory in Zemun near Belgrade, for delivery by the end of that year. The prototype was designated IK-1, with the \"IK\" standing for (Ljubomir) Ilić and Kosta (Sivčev). It is believed that the prototype was complete by September 1934, but the first flight was delayed due to concerns about the wing structure. The following month, Bajdak was appointed as test pilot for the prototype, but he did not co-operate in the preparations for the maiden flight, and decided to develop his own test program.\n\nPermission was granted for flight testing to begin in April 1935, and Bajdak conducted his first flight in the prototype on 22 April 1935. For this initial uneventful flight, no weapons were installed and a light fuel load was used. The following day, Bajdak put the IK-1 into unplanned aerobatic manoeuvres, after which the wing fabric was observed as being slack. An official from Ikarus checked it and stated that this would resolve once the fabric varnish had completely dried. Bajdak took the aircraft for a third test flight the next day, which involved more unplanned aerobatics. When the aircraft was at , Bajdak put it into a shallow dive and pulled up abruptly at high speed, at which point the wing fabric began to tear rapidly, to the extent that it could be seen from the ground. The aircraft dropped into a spin to starboard, and Bajdak baled out safely while the IK-1 crashed into the ground.\n\nCritics exploited the accident to undermine the IK-1 concept, with Bajdak joining those criticising the aircraft. The three flights were not considered sufficient to give a verdict on the design, and the debate over its future was fierce. This placed significant pressure on the designers, as every element of the aircraft design was subsequently attacked. Eventually, it was generally agreed that the aircraft was well-designed, but it needed more testing. At this point, Ikarus decided to build a second prototype, as it was evident that the hand-sewn fabric seam on the wing had not stood up to the strain of aerobatics, and their workmanship was in question. The second prototype took 10 months to build, with the two designers closely involved.\n\nThe main difference from the IK-1 was that the IK-2 had wings covered with metal sheeting, leaving only the rear fuselage and tailplane fabric covered. The new wing was tested with both fabric and metal covering at the request of the VVKJ. Other changes were a radiator of reduced size and improved shape, and modified air intakes, making for a more streamlined fuselage. The two Darne machine guns were replaced with two Browning/FN machine guns.\n\nAfter the second prototype was delivered, the aircraft was placed in the hands of a different test pilot, \"Poručnik\" (1st Lieutenant) Janko Dobnikar, who conducted its first flight on 24 August 1934. Dobnikar had worked closely with the designers and Ikarus during its construction and static testing, and his suggestions had resulted in an improved cockpit layout. He strictly followed a completely new test program, while installed testing equipment recorded the various characteristics of the aircraft. After gaining complete mastery of the aircraft, he conducted some aerobatic manoeuvres during a visit by the future Turkish president İsmet İnönü, which included a complete inverted loop. In mid-October 1935, Dobnikar used the second prototype to break the unofficial European air speed record for an aircraft with a fixed undercarriage, attaining a speed of , which was also a Yugoslav air speed record. The aircraft was able to achieve greater than expected power at altitudes of . Dobnikar completed the testing program and submitted his report to the VVKJ on 23 May 1937.\n\nAfter VVKJ acceptance, a group of pilots conducted 16 mock dogfights between the IK-2 and the Hawker Fury I biplane already in service with the VVKJ, during which the IK-2 displayed overall superiority over the British-built aircraft. At one point, Bajdak declared his continuing doubts about the aircraft, and Dobnikar challenged him to a duel, with Bajdak flying his preferred aircraft, the Fury I. After Dobnikar won the climbing competition and a race to Zemun and back from Belgrade, the final dogfight forced Bajdak to concede that the IK-2 was the better aircraft. On 20 November 1937, the VVKJ submitted a proposal to order a batch of 12 IK-2s, which was approved the following month. The production version included some additional improvements, but continued testing resulted in further delays, with the aircraft not entering service for another year. By this time, international consensus had coalesced around the superiority of the low-wing monoplane, and the IK-2 was already obsolescent by the time it was delivered to VVKJ fighter units.\n\nThe first six production aircraft were delivered to the 6th Fighter Regiment of the VVKJ, based at Zemun, in early 1939. The pilots subjected them to considerable additional testing, before they entered normal service around mid-year. The remaining six entered service during the remainder of 1939. The aircraft were delivered without radios or armament, which were fitted in VVKJ workshops. In October 1939, the IK-2s were transferred to the 4th Fighter Regiment in Zagreb until licence-built Hawker Hurricanes were delivered from Zemun, after which the IK-2s were to be transferred to the 5th Fighter Regiment in Niš. By the end of 1940, all the production IK-2s were concentrated in the 107th Fighter Squadron of the 34th Fighter Group, which consisted solely of IK-2s. This was only an interim allocation, as the other squadron of the group was equipped with Hurricanes, and as soon as the 107th Fighter Squadron could be equipped with Hurricanes, the IK-2s were to move to the 5th Fighter Regiment. The threat of war overtook this planned deployment, and on 13 March 1941, the IK-2s of the 107th Fighter Squadron were moved to Bosanski Aleksandrovac near Banja Luka, under the command of \"Kapetan\" Zarko Vukajlović.\n\nWhen the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia commenced on 6 April 1941, only eight IK-2s were serviceable. One had been damaged in a landing accident, two were at the workshops in Zagreb being repaired, and the fourth unserviceable machine was in a badly damaged condition at Bosanski Aleksandrovac. That day and the next, the 107th Fighter Squadron patrolled over Bosnia but did not make any contact with the enemy. Two machines conducted a combat air patrol over the airfield of the 8th Bomber Regiment at Nova Topola. This pattern continued the following day without incident, but patrol duration and coverage was limited by the short range of the aircraft. On 8 April, a patrol unsuccessfully gave chase to a lone German reconnaissance aircraft, and later in the day, one of the IK-2s force landed, leaving seven operational aircraft.\n\nAbout 14:00 on 9 April, two \"Staffeln\" of German Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters from II. Gruppe of \"Jagdgeschwader 54\" were observed heading towards Nova Topola just as two IK-2s were landing after a patrol in poor flying weather. One of the IK-2s managed to overshoot and climbed to meet them, but the other was unable to, and had to complete its landing. \"Podnarednik\" (Junior Sergeant) Branko Jovanović used the extreme manoeuvrability of his IK-2 to avoid the nine Bf 109s that swooped in to attack, while a total of eight Hurricanes and five more IK-2s from the 4th Fighter Regiment scrambled to meet the Germans. For the following seven or eight minutes, a furious dogfight ensued over Novo Topola, during which two German aircraft were claimed and two Hurricanes and one IK-2 were lost. German records indicate that only one of their aircraft was lost, and that the pilot survived. \"Podnarednik\" Stikić survived the loss of his IK-2, but was badly wounded. The Germans, low on fuel, broke off and headed north.\n\nThe following day, one IK-2 force landed due to engine failure, reducing the number of serviceable IK-2s to five. Despite deteriorating weather conditions and revolts within the Yugoslav forces, combat patrols continued. At 12:00 on 11 April, all aircraft were grounded by the weather. On 12 April, aircraft of the 4th Fighter Regiment took to the air again, chasing German reconnaissance aircraft, but the IK-2s did not record any victories. The following day, the 4th Fighter Regiment continued carrying out sorties, but around 12:00 the commander of the 2nd Mixed Air Brigade ordered the remaining aircraft of the 4th Fighter Regiment to be destroyed, and all personnel to withdraw via road to Sarajevo.\n\nAt the end of the brief campaign, the Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia (, ZNDH) made the three or four surviving IK-2s serviceable using other captured aircraft for spares. At the beginning of 1942, there were four IK-2s in service with the ZNDH, but they lacked spare parts. Later that year, an operational IK-2 was observed at Rajlovac airfield near Sarajevo, and in October 1943, two of the IK-2s were operating from Zalužani airfield north of Banja Luka, and remained there for nearly a year conducting strafing missions. At the end of 1943, all four IK-2s were still in service, but at the end of the following year, just two IK-2s remained. No IK-2s survived the war.\n\nA proposed development of the IK-2 was the IK-4, a dual control two-seater fast reconnaissance monoplane, but it was never ordered.\n\n\nSource: \n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2267358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267358", "title": "Hypermart USA", "text": "Hypermart USA\n\nHypermart USA was a demonstrator project operated by Walmart in the 1980s and 1990s, which attempted to combine groceries and general merchandise under one roof at a substantial discount. The hypermart concept was modeled after earlier efforts from other retailers, notably French retailers such as Auchan and Carrefour, and the Midwestern big retailer Meijer.\n\nAll stores used a floorplan that exceeded . They featured a mini-mall, food court, arcade, bank, and other kiosk operations. The ones in Kansas City and Topeka featured McDonald's, Subway, and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen in their food courts.\n\nThe prototype did not go as well as planned. Walmart was unaccustomed to operating such massive stores, and an economic recession had brought on a decline in retail sales. Although the stores were profitable, sales projections were too optimistic and the company did not anticipate the great heating and cooling costs, the resistance of customers towards parking and congestion issues.\n\nThe first Walmart Supercenter, which used a floorplan in the range, was opened in 1988 in Washington, Missouri. As the Supercenter proved to be a much more profitable experiment, Walmart renamed the stores \"Wal-Mart's Hypermart USA\" in April 1990, and eventually began either converting them to Supercenter operations or closing them.\n\nThe Hypermart USA concept was officially discontinued in 2000, when Walmart announced it was converting the Kansas City Hypermart USA into a Walmart Supercenter. The former Kansas City store, then a Supercenter, ultimately closed in January 2007. The original Hypermart in Garland, Texas closed in May 2008. The Topeka, Kansas, hypermarket, located on Southwest Wanamaker Road, is still open, although its exterior has been remodeled as well as the Arlington, Texas, location on South Cooper Street.\n\nGarland, Texas (December 28, 1987)\n\nThis location was converted several years later to a Walmart Supercenter and lost its Hypermart USA branding. By May 2008, Walmart announced it would replace this store with a smaller Supercenter nearby. In October 2017, it was announced that the city of Garland would buy the vacant site with intentions of redeveloping it as a \"gateway\" to the city. It was demolished in the summer of 2018.\n\nTopeka, Kansas (January 1988)\n\n, the Topeka, Kansas, Hypermart USA store is still operating as a Walmart Supercenter.\n\nArlington, Texas (August 1988)\n\n, the Arlington, Texas, Hypermart is still operating as a Walmart Supercenter.\n\nThe Kansas City, Missouri, location opened on February 20, 1990. Located just northeast of the now-closed Bannister Mall in the Benjamin Plaza development, the South Kansas City store was the last Hypermart USA to open. It was the largest of the four Hypermart stores at 256,637 sq ft. Described as Walmart's \"mall without walls,\" the Kansas City Hypermart included a number of restaurants and specialty outlets in addition to the combination grocery and general merchandise discount store. \n\nIn May 2000, Walmart announced it would spend $4.9 million to convert the Kansas City Hypermart USA to a Walmart Supercenter. Walmart indicated that it was converting its last remaining Hypermart, because the stores were too big and too inconvenient for customers. Walmart explained that the effort offer everything under one roof was more of a European style of retail, and it was overwhelming to the American shopper. Kansas City Councilman Chuck Eddy claimed that there were other reasons for the failure of the Kansas City Hypermart. Eddy cited a high volume of complaints from residents about the store, including time-consuming lines at checkout counters, trash and runaway carts in the parking lot, dirty restrooms, and overall messy conditions and poor management. Walmart wanted to build a new Supercenter store in South Kansas City on State Line Road near 135th Street, so city leaders pressured Walmart to make improvements to the conditions of the Hypermart location before they would be given approval to move forward with the new South Kansas City store. At the time, Walmart said it would cost almost $5 million to renovate the Hypermart store. Walmart moved forward with the renovation and conversion of the Hypermart store, along with bringing in new management to address the concerns of poor management at the store. In 2006, Walmart began construction on a new Walmart Supercenter on the site of the former Blue Ridge Mall. The new Supercenter was to be the first of Walmart's new \"high-efficiency\" stores. As a result of the new Supercenters on State Line Road and the former Blue Ridge Mall site, along with declining business and a growing number of retail closings in Bannister Mall and Benjamin Plaza, Walmart announced that it would close former Hypermart store in mid-January 2007. The 400 employees were offered jobs at the new Blue Ridge store and other area Walmart stores. After 7 years of vacancy, the former Kansas City Hypermart was demolished in 2014 along with much of the surrounding vacant retail developments as part of a large redevelopment project.\n\n"}
{"id": "2267364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267364", "title": "Heishiro Mitsurugi", "text": "Heishiro Mitsurugi\n\n, better known as just Mitsurugi, is a fictional character in the \"Soulcalibur\" series of fighting games by Namco. He is a mainstay and one of most iconic characters in the franchise as one of only four characters to appear as a playable character in every installment since 1995's \"Soul Edge\". In the games' lore, Mitsurugi is a master swordsman from Japan turned a wandering mercenary ever looking for the ultimate sword and a challenge, who is a rival of Taki and Algol and the enemy of Setsuka.\n\nMitsurugi quickly became and then remained one of the most iconic and popular \"Soulcalibur\" characters, also often having been noted as a well balanced fighter in the terms of gameplay. In the first \"Soulcalibur\", he has been replaced in Korea by Arthur who later became a standalone character in \"Soulcalibur III\".\n\nIn the backstory of \"Soul Edge\", Heishiro is an orphaned son of a Japanese farmer, who after suffering years of witnessing his homeland being ravaged by bandits and war, he decided to take up swordsmanship. At the age of 14, having picked up a sword and the last name Mitsurugi, he went to train under the Murakami clan. Mitsurugi, noted as a great warrior, received numerous commendations and rose in the ranks, but his only true desire was a worthy opponent. After leaving the Murakami clan, Mitsurugi continued to fight in the great civil war in Japan as a hired mercenary. Having originally dismissed the firearm as a novelty, he was shocked to see the riflemen obliterate the Takeda cavalry at the Battle of Nagashino. He decided he needs to find a stronger weapon for himself: the magic sword of legend: Soul Edge.\n\nMitsurugi encountered the female ninja Taki during this time, but was unable to find any trace of the legendary \"Hero's Sword\". In his frustration of finding no signs of Soul Edge, he returned home and challenged Teppou Hei, a man wielding the tanegashima to a duel, but suffered an embarrassing defeat, leaving him with a scar of a gunshot wound on his right shoulder and forcing him to depart in shame on a second quest to perfect his swordsmanship so that he might eventually defeat the gun. It was during this quest that he learned of the Azure Knight, Nightmare, who terrorized Europe with a sword deemed invincible, and set out after him in order to find what he considered a worthy challenge (this being his motivation through the remainder of the series since \"Soulcalibur\"). Nightmare's trail eventually disappeared, but Mitsurugi was unwilling to give up, and gradually improved his fighting style to the point riflemen were no longer a threat. Returning from his quest Mitsurugi challenged Teppou Hei again, but this time Mitsurugi managed to kill the man with a single strike with his sword.\n\nFour years later, during the events of \"Soulcalibur II\", Mitsurugi stumbled upon the trail of Soul Edge while visiting a castle in Xiwei, where a mysterious dying man, after being saved by him from a group of assassins, handed him a shard of the cursed blade. Although skeptical at first, Mitsurugi accepted the gift. Soon afterward, an incident occurred in which a servant of the Emperor of Ming marched to the castle, demanding the \"Hero's Sword\", and was slain when he refused to leave without it. Mitsurugi sensed that war was coming, but Soul Edge meant nothing to him. He had crossed countless battlefields, defeating every conceivable enemy, even those with rifles. What had once been his greatest enemy was none of his concern, as it no longer proved to be a threat. His only concern was with finding an opponent stronger than himself. Wondering what was happening in Japan at that time, and whether or not he could have a final showdown with Taki, he decided to return to his homeland.\n\nBy the time of \"Soulcalibur III and Soulcalibur IV\", the Murakami clan, with whom Mitsurugi stayed upon his return, refused to join with Toyotomi Hideyoshi, choosing instead to protect their existence as fierce pirates and rulers of the sea. Since Mitsurugi could find no trace of Taki, he went to aid the Murakami and aided them in their naval victory. Soon, he learned of the arrival of Nightmare, whom he had lost track of before. Mitsurugi left the Murakami and went to the West again. Ever-searching for a worthy adversary to test his skills, Mitsurugi journeyed to Ostrheinsburg, where he entered a chaotic alternate dimension and faced the Hero King, Algol, high atop a colossal tower. The two warriors clashed when suddenly Algol disappeared, along with the tower and all their surroundings—a dimensional convergence had warped Mitsurugi back to reality before the duel could be decided. He had also unknowingly make rival with Setsuka, after he mortally wounded her master during a battle that eventually led to his death, although he did not realize it until they fight sometime during the events of \"Soulcalibur IV\", at which he defeated her by stunning Setsuka with a punch, but lost his katana Shishi-Oh in the battle.\n\nIn \"Soulcalibur V\", after the warring period of Japan had ended, Mitsurugi has settled a quiet life as a farmer for seventeen years. He regains his fighting spirit when he heard about Soul Calibur and goes on a journey to once again continue the battle with Algol that was left unfinished years before.\n\nA young Mitsurugi returns in the reboot/altered timeline-themed game \"Soulcalibur VI\". It was revealed that his failed attempt to fight Nightmare is because Taki was sent by Edge Master to keep him away from end having an awful encounter with the Azure Knight. Misturugi made a friendly rivalry with a universe-displaced The Witcher Geralt of Rivia, and his long waited rival who is also his counterpart from SNK Corporation, \"Samurai Shodown\"’s protagonist Haohmaru.\n\nMitsurugi also appeared in \"Namco × Capcom\" as a playable character along with Taki, with whom he makes a temporary alliance there. He also appears as a limited card in \"Outcast Odyssey\". Yuri Lowell from the \"Tales\" series can wear Mitsurugi's costume as his alternate outfit. He is also referenced in \"Ridge Racer 6\" with the car named Mitsurugi Meltfire.\n\n\"Soulcalibur \"producer Motohiro Okubo described Mitsurugi as the character who \"naturally plays the most like a samurai\" which is what they had in mind while creating and developing him. Mitsurugi's character was inspired by real-life swordsman Miyamoto Musashi. His backstory is also similar to Toshiro Mifune's character in the film \"The Seven Samurai\", including that he was raised by farmers that were killed, became a swordsman, has a cocky and angry demeanor, and earned the title of a samurai by his valor and fighting prowess. Furthermore, his \"Soulcalibur V\" appearance is based on Mifune himself (who coincidentally has played Miyamoto Musashi several times in his career). Mitsurugi is one of only three characters to show physical signs of aging from the time skip, the others being Siegfried and Hilde. While developing \"Soulcalibur VI\", Mitsurugi and Sophitia have been the first characters to be created and then used \"as a foundation\" for the decisions regarding the other characters' movements, visuals, and so forth.\n\nMitsurugi's proud and reckless attitude made him similar to Paul Phoenix from Namco's own \"Tekken\" universe, and his facial build is also alike that of \"Tekken\"'s Kazuya Mishima. Setsuka's fighting style has common qualities with Mitsurugi's and Taki's. Mitsurugi's 2P costume in \"Soulcalibur II\" makes him resemble Haohmaru from SNK's \"Samurai Shodown\" series. Samanosuke from Capcom's later \"\" looks similar to Mitsurugi from the first \"Soulcalibur\".\n\nIn \"Soul Edge\", Mitsurugi and Hwang are very similar with the exception of a few attacks. In later games, both characters have been given new attacks, but Hwang ended up keeping most of the ones that both had used. Mitsurugi fights quite differently in the \"Soulcalibur\" games when compared to \"Soul Edge\". In both the \"Tekken\" and the \"Soulcalibur\" series, Yoshimitsu borrows some of Mitsurugi's moves while Mitsurugi borrowing one of his from \"Tekken\".\n\n\"Ultra Game Players\" guide to \"Soul Edge\", which recommended him for his overall balance, combos and speed, states: \"One of the more popular characters, Mitsurugi is also one of the easiest characters to use. Since he is so well-rounded, [players] should use him with a more aggressive, offensive style in mind.\" \"Das offizielle PlayStation Magazin\" opined he is the best all-rounder in \"Soul Edge\" and ideal to learn the basics. According to \"Computer and Video Games\", Mitsurugi \"is the 'average' fighter of \"Soul Edge\", but has the potential to blosom into the most lethal fighter in the game.\" Overall, the magazine recommended him as a \"solid character for both the beginners and masters alike.\" In the opinion of top British player of \"Soulcalibur\", Martin Casey, Mitsurugi was the best character in this game.\n\n\"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" opined Mitsurugi in \"Soulcalibur II\" \"is most effective when played aggressively, pressing the attack with his katana whenever possible. He has a couple of alternate stances, a potent, unblockable low attack, and dangerous juggle moves.\" \"EGM\" recommended him for beginners and \"button mashers\". Conversely, \"GamePro\"'s guide to \"Soulcalibur II\" listed his strong points as being \"an excellent defensive character, very agile, and with a great side step and good reach,\" but offset by his \"poor long range offensive options\" and a necessity to \"master a lot of moves to make use of his pros.\" Noting his very high popularity in that game, GameSpy's guide states Mitsurugi \"is one of the characters that benefit a lot from the new systems\" in \"Soulcalibur II\" and \"while he may not have the best sidestep in the game, his ability to contain opponents and snuff them out makes him absolutely fearsome.\"\n\nAccording to IGN, \"Whereas most \"SC\" fighters are either nimble little backstabbers or giant, hulking brutes, Mitsurugi strikes a nice balance between power and agility. He isn't always the easiest character to dominate with, but experienced players often gravitate towards this wandering samurai for a good reason.\" The battle director of \"Soulcalibur VI\" said that in this game Mitsurugi can be used by the players with a wide range of skill, from beginner to advanced.\n\nArthur (アーサー \"Āsā\") is a playable character introduced in the first \"Soulcalibur\", where he replaced Mitsurugi in Korea due to the local sensibilities regarding the subject of the samurai. Arthur is an orphaned European who has become a swordsman in Japan. In his first appearance, he looks exactly like Mitsurugi except with blond hair and an eye patch, and his weapon, movelist and ending are identical to Mitsurugi's. Arthur returned as a bonus character in all versions of \"Soulcalibur III\", representing the \"Katana\" Create-a-Fighter discipline. In this game he is given unique facial characteristics and a weapon of his own, with his outfit based on that of Mitsurugi in \"Soulcalibur II\". Arthur's Destined Battle enemy in \"Soulcalibur\" is against Taki (the same as Mitsurugi's), while in \"Soulcalibur III\" it is Mitsurugi.\n\nMitsurugi, declared the \"coolest of all \"Soulcalibur\" characters\" by the O\"fficial Dreamcast Magazine UK\" in 1999, has become and then remained a popular fan favourite and even arguably most iconic character in the \"Soulcalibur\" series. He was initially received so well that the original plan for the sequel to \"Soul Edge\", codenamed \"\"Soul Edge 2\"\" (not to be mistaken with a later another project of the same working title that later became \"Soulcalibur V\"), was to have an all-new cast except only him. In a 2002 official poll by Namco prior to the release of \"Soulcalibur II\" regarding their favorite character, Mitsurugi placed ninth with 2.5% of the tally, tied with Siegfried. In a 2012 \"battle royale\" popularity contest of iconic fighting game characters in \"Pembroke Daily Observer\", he won against Iori Yagami but was defeated by Liu Kang. In another official Namco poll, 13 years later in 2015, Mitsurugi placed third overall as the most popular male character.\n\nMitsurugi has been nominated to \"Ultra Game Players\"' 1997 Ultra Awards as one of the four characters in the category \"Videogame Hunk\" and Kotaku later included him among the most attractive game characters of the 1990s. In 2002, \"Official Xbox Magazine\" called him \"the best \"Soul Calibur\" guy ever.\" In 2008, Mitsurugi was ranked number seven top \"Soulcalibur\" fighter by IGN. Gizmodo Japan included him among top ten swordsmen in video games. Nathan Ditum from \"PlayStation Official Magazine – UK\" chose him as his personal favourite out of the cast of \"Soulcalibur V\". In 2013, \"Complex\" ranked him as the second best character in the series regarding his gameplay options, especially the balance.\n\n"}

The status is referred to in Oregon law as a domestic partnership, avoiding the use of the terms \"marriage\" or \"civil union\". Governor Ted Kulongoski signed the bill on May 9, 2007. While January 1, 2008 was the date the statute would have taken effect, a court challenge had delayed its implementation. It was resolved on February 1, 2008, and the law went into effect that day, with registrations beginning on February 4, 2008.\n\nOn July 8, 2005, Oregon state senators approved legislation to allow same-sex civil unions. As originally written, Oregon Senate Bill 1000 would create civil unions and prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation in housing, employment, public accommodations and public services. The vote at the Oregon State Capitol in Salem was 19-10 in favor of the measure.\n\nThe Republican Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives, Karen Minnis, announced that she would not let the bill be passed. On July 21, the House performed a series of moves where the bill was amended, removing most of its language and replacing it with different text (seen by some to be a \"gut and stuff\" maneuver). The new text of Senate Bill 1000 no longer contained language about sexual orientation, prohibition of discrimination, nor civil unions. Instead, it reaffirmed the recent state constitutional prohibition of same-sex marriage and proposed to create \"reciprocal beneficiary agreements\". \"Reciprocal beneficiaries\" could be any two people prohibited by law from marrying each other, such as a \"widowed mother and her unmarried son\", and would not have the rights and obligations of married persons, specifically excluding employer-granted benefits such as health insurance or retirement benefits. Reciprocal beneficiaries would be granted inheritance rights, and the power to make medical or financial decisions if the reciprocal beneficiary was incapacitated.\n\nThe changes effectively killed momentum to pass the bill, which died in committee.\n\nHowever, after the November 2006 mid-term elections Democrats won a majority of the formerly Republican-controlled House, and in early 2007, Democrats re-introduced a bill in the House similar to the 2005 legislation. The bill adopted the term \"domestic partnership\" to describe these unions; the terms \"marriage\" or \"civil union\" were absent. This bill enjoyed a relatively easy passage through the legislature, when compared to its 2005 predecessor. Passed by the House on April 17, 2007 (by a vote of 34-26) and by the Senate on May 2, 2007 (by a vote of 21-9), Governor Kulongoski signed the Oregon Family Fairness Act on May 9, 2007. The law was scheduled to take effect January 1, 2008, but was delayed by a preliminary injunction until after a hearing on February 1, 2008, where the injunction was lifted. Domestic partnerships became effective from February 4, 2008.\n\nGiven the use of the term \"domestic partnerships\", the Oregon legislation is more in line with Washington state's recognition of same-sex relationships and California's recognition of same-sex relationships, as opposed to the civil union legislation created in Vermont, New Jersey, and New Hampshire. However, unlike the registries in California and Washington state, domestic partnerships in Oregon are not available to opposite-sex couples.\n\nOregon's legislation has no ceremony requirement. All marriage and civil union legislation require a ceremony, whether religious or civil, to be considered valid. In Oregon couples are required only to register their domestic partnerships through the submission of a paper form. Additionally, the Oregon statute states that \"the legal recognition of domestic partnerships under the laws of this state may not be effective beyond the borders of this state and cannot impact restrictions contained in federal law.\"\n\nHouse Bill 2839 was introduced during the 2009 legislative session to make some technical fixes to the state's exiting domestic partnership legislation, including in the areas of taxation and health insurance benefits and entitlements, taking a domestic partner's surname, and clarifying the term \"domestic partnership\" and \"civil union\" as used in other states, so that the state of Oregon would recognize them as \"domestic partnerships\". The Governor signed the bill into law on June 25, 2009.\n\nIn 2007, an attempted referendum to repeal these laws before they take effect failed to gather enough signatures. Such an effort, accomplished by a petition putting the laws to voter approval via a ballot question, would have delayed enforcement of the law to January 1, 2009. In September 2007, groups challenging the amendment submitted approximately 63,000 signatures in favor of repealing the legislation; the minimum number of signatures required for a referendum is 55,179. The Secretary of State's office later determined that only 55,063 valid signatures were collected, thereby removing a barrier to a January 1, 2008 effective date. On December 28, federal judge Michael W. Mosman issued an injunction preventing implementation of the law, after hearing a legal challenge (by a group opposing the measure) criticizing the method used by the Secretary of State's office to determine what constitutes a valid signature. A hearing on this issue was then scheduled for February 1, 2008, when the injunction was lifted, allowing the law to go in force immediately, with registrations beginning on February 4, 2008.\n\n\n"}

Ancona\n\nAssociazione Calcio Ancona, commonly referred to as Ancona, was an Italian football club based in Ancona, Marche. It was founded in 1905 as Unione Sportiva Anconitana, changing its name to Ancona Calcio in 1982 and being refounded in 2004 (using clause in the Article 52 of N.O.I.F.) with its last denomination. Since 2010 the club is in liquidation and the current liquidator is Giorgio Paolo Raffaele Perrotti. Another club of the city, U.S. Ancona 1905 claimed as the phoenix club. However, the club also folded in 2017, with a second phoenix club was founded in amateur league.\n\nThe nicknames of the team were \"i Dorici\" (The Dorians) and \"i Biancorossi\" (The Red and Whites).\n\nAncona had spells in Serie B before World War II and shortly after, but would not return to that level until 1988. Under coach Vincenzo Guerini, the club's rise was meteoric: 5th place in 1990 and promotion was achieved two years later. Although they would finish 17th and were relegated after just one year, the club nonetheless played in some memorable high-scoring games including a 3–0 home win over Inter. Midfielder Lajos Detari, winger Fabio Lupo and striker Massimo Agostini ensured Ancona had a respectable \"Goals For\" tally but conceded goals at an alarming rate.\n\nThe following year, Ancona reached an Italian Cup final but were heavily beaten by Sampdoria. Near misses in the promotion race was followed by relegation in 1996 and again in 1998. After returning to Serie B in 2000, Ancona would achieve another promotion in 2003.\n\nIts second Serie A season would be one of the worst of any Serie A club, with a record-equalling 28-game winless streak from the start. They finished the season with a pitiful 13 points. This was followed by bankruptcy and condemnation to Serie C2.\n\nAncona finished 5th in 2005–2006 season and lost promotion play-off against Sassuolo by finishing best place but promoted after expulsions of Gela and Sassari Torres due to financial troubles. They finished 16th in Serie C1/B and played relegation play-off against Teramo in 2006–2007 season. Ancona won 4–2 by aggregate and remained in Serie C1.\n\nIn October 2007 it was reported that Centro Sportivo Italiano (CSI), run by the Vatican's Conference of Bishops, had purchased an 80% share in the club. The report read:\n\"It is a way to moralise football, to bring some ethics to a sector that is going through a deep crisis of values,\" said Ancona Archbishop Edoardo Menichelli, who recently played a benefit game against an Italian national team of singers.\n\nCSI president Edio Costantini said the centre wanted \"to invest in the true meaning of sport. We want football to be again a means of education and not tied to strictly monetary values\".\n\n\"We will show that, for boys, football is not just an illusion or a bad example.\"\nAccording to Catholic World News on 9 October 2007, the Vatican was distancing itself from the move, claiming the CSI was a group of 'lay Catholics' and the Vatican had 'nothing to do' with the project. Yet in a Reuters report on 11 October 2007, both the Vatican Secretary of State and the Pope endorsed the move, quoted as saying respectively:\nVatican Secretary of State Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone praised the project in a statement read at its presentation, saying it was designed to 'bring out the human and spiritual values in sport'.\n\nPope Benedict XVI also encouraged the team after receiving a shirt with his name and the number 16 on from them at a general audience in St Peter's Square\nThe club has had several Papal connections. The 'Project Soccer' initiative was blessed by Pope Benedict XVI with a letter sent by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone to the Centro Sportivo Italiano. The 'Del Conero' stadium was visited by Pope John Paul II twice.\n\nThe club has been promoted back to Serie B after winning promotion playoff after defeating Perugia by finished best place and Taranto by 2–1 aggregate in 2007–2008 season. Ancona finished 19th at Serie B at next season and faced with Rimini at play-outs. Ancona won them with a 2–1 aggregate and remained in it.\n\nAncona played the 2009–10 season in Serie B, finishing 17th despite 2 points deduction due to financial irregularities in the season and avoiding relegation, but eventually filed for bankruptcy and was unable to join any of the lower divisions. The club, however, managed to submit application for a place in Terza Categoria, the lowest level of the Italian football league system. Their application was accepted on 13 September 2010, as they were granted a playing ground by the city administration. However, they were still lacking players and a manager and were subsequently forced to forfeit the first four games of the season. According to FIGC regulations, this led to the club's removal from the league and they are now expected to undergo liquidation.\n\n\"This list of former players includes those who received international caps while playing for the team, made significant contributions to the team in terms of appearances or goals while playing for the team, or who made significant contributions to the sport either before they played for the team, or after they left. It is clearly not yet complete and all inclusive, and additions and refinements will continue to be made over time.\"\n\nThe main rivals of Ancona was Ascoli.\n\nTwo illegitimate phoenix clubs had formed in Ancona:\n\n"}

The parish is on Wiltshire's southern boundary with Dorset and the village is southeast of the Dorset town of Shaftesbury.\n\nThe \"Royal\" in the name refers to the royal hunting lodge that was used for hunting on the Chase.\n\nThe earliest known record of the Church of England parish church of St. Peter ad Vincula dates from 1291. Early English style features that survive from this time include the tower arch, a doorway and several windows, including two in the nave. The bell tower was built after a gift of £10 for the purpose in 1412.\n\nThe earliest record of the church's dedication to St. Peter ad Vincula (\"\"St Peter in Chains\"\") dates from 1469. It is one of only 15 churches in England with this dedication, which is after the Basilica of San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome.\n\nLate in the 15th and early in the 16th centuries extensive Perpendicular Gothic alterations were made to the church. The tower was rebuilt and the south porch and three-bay north aisle were added and the nave was increased in height.\n\nA west gallery was added in 1714 and later removed, probably during rebuilding work in the 1850s. The works included rebuilding the north aisle, removing the chancel arch and blocking up the east window. In 1966 the church was designated as Grade II* listed.\n\nIn 1553 the church had three bells and a sanctus bell. One was recast by William Tosier of Salisbury in 1728 and another by Mears and Stainbank in 1882 but the third mediaeval bell still hung in the tower in 1927. Two more bells were cast by Mears and Stainbank and added to the tower in 1889. In 1999 the three Mears and Stainbank bells and the mediaeval bell were replaced with a ring of six bells cast by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. The 1728 bell has not been recast but it is no longer rung. The sanctus bell has also been retained; it was cast in Salisbury in about 1400.\n\nThe parish had a Methodist congregation by 1773. For several decades the Methodists worshipped in private homes licensed for the purpose. In 1879 a Primitive Methodist chapel was built of brick. It was closed in 1957.\n\nTollard Royal has a public house, the King John Inn.\n\nSandroyd School, an independent junior school, is near the village. The nearest state schools are at Ludwell and Shaftesbury, the village's 19th-century National School having closed in 1962.\n\nRotherley Downs, a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest, is partly within the parish.\n\nLieutenant-General Augustus Pitt Rivers, army officer and founder of modern archaeology, created a pleasure garden in 1880 at the Rushmore Estate near Tollard Royal. This was the first private garden to be opened for public enjoyment in the United Kingdom. Since 1990 the annual Larmer Tree Festival of music and arts has been held here.\n\nAshcombe House and its estate lies between Tollard Royal and Berwick St John, in Berwick parish. Photographer and designer Cecil Beaton lived there between 1930 and 1945; it was bought by entertainer Madonna and her husband Guy Ritchie in 2002, and transferred to Ritchie in 2009 as part of their divorce settlement.\n\n"}

On his return to the princes at Blankenburg am Harz, he was regarded with suspicion, and he departed for Paris to await events. He is thought to have indicated to the French Directory the possession by the Comte d'Antraigues, an agent of Louis XVIII, of documents compromising Pichegru. In April 1798 he surrendered to Claude Roberjot, at the time envoy of the Directory to the government of Hamburg (nominally, to the Hanseatic League), other papers relating to the matter.\n\nHe followed Roberjot to the Batavian Republic, and there wrote a memorandum to prove that the only hope for France lay in the immediate return of Bonaparte from the , followed by assumption of the supreme power. This note reached Bonaparte in Alexandria, after passing through of Berlin and Constantinople.\n\nAfter the 18 Brumaire coup, when he returned to Paris in the hope of recognition by Napoleon, Rocques was imprisoned, and on his release he was kept under police supervision. Napoleon, who appreciated his real insight into European politics and his extraordinary knowledge of European courts, attached him to the Empire's secret cabinet in spite of his past intrigues.\n\nHe received a salary of 14,000 francs, reduced later to 6,000, for reports on political questions for Napoleon's use, and for pamphlets written to help the imperial policy. He tried to dissuade Napoleon from his Habsburg matrimony plans with Marie Louise and the invasion of Russia, and warned against expansion of the Empire beyond the Rhine, the Alps and the Pyrenees.\n\nThe Bourbon Restoration made no change in his position: he was maintained as confidential adviser on foreign and home politics, and gave apt advice to the new government. His career ended after the July Revolution, and he died in obscurity at Chaillot.\n\n"}

{"id": "2267406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267406", "title": "The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band", "text": "The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band\n\nThe West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band (WCPAEB) was an American psychedelic rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1965. The group created music that possessed an eerie, and at times sinister atmosphere, and contained material that was bluntly political, childlike, and bizarre. Representing different musical backgrounds among band members, the group, at times, resembled a traditional Byrds-esque folk rock ensemble, but the WCPAEB also, within the same body of work, recorded avant-garde music marked by multi-layered vocal harmonies.\n\nAspiring musician and scenester Bob Markley managed to join the group the Laughing Wind in exchange for his connections in the music industry and substantial bankroll. The original five-piece line-up consisted of Michael Lloyd (rhythm guitar, vocals), Shaun Harris (bass guitar, vocals, Danny Harris (lead guitar, vocals), John Ware (drums), and Markley (tambourine, vocals).\n\nThe band debuted with the album \"Volume One\" in 1966 on the small FiFo record label. In the early years of the group, much was made of the WCPAEB's elaborate psychedelic light shows, which became the focal point of their live performances in Los Angeles. Following the release of \"Volume One\", the WCPAEB signed with Reprise Records, recording three albums with the company, including arguably their most accomplished work \"\" in 1968. Two additional albums, \"Where's My Daddy?\" and \"Markley, A Group\", were distributed on independent labels before the group disbanded in 1970.\n\nThe group was formed in August 1965 when Los Angeles playboy Bob Markley, a wealthy law graduate and adopted son of an oil tycoon, organized a party at his home in Beverly Hills. Markley previously hosted the television program \"Oklahoma Bandstand\" in 1958, until he was signed by a Warner Bros. Records executive, and purchased a luxury mansion in Los Angeles. He released two commercially unsuccessful singles, \"Will We Meet Again\" and \"Summer's Comin' On\", between 1960 and 1961, and produced recordings for some musical acts, including Lucifer and the Peppermints, Bobby Rebel, and Sonny Knight on Markley's own local record labels. In attendance at Markley's party were dozens of journalists, deejays, and various individuals of the \"in-crowd\", as well as live performances by Al Kooper followed by the Yardbirds. Producer Kim Fowley introduced Markley to Michael Lloyd, and brothers Shaun and Danny Harris, members of the group the Laughing Wind.\n\nLloyd began his music career in 1962 in an instrumental surf rock band which included Jimmy Greenspoon, known as the New Dimensions and later the AlleyKats. The group entered Stereo Masters studio to record three albums, during which time Lloyd first became acquainted with Fowley. While attending the Hollywood Professional School, Lloyd befriended the Harris brothers, who recorded the regional hit \"Ski Storm\" with rival act the Snowmen. In early 1965, Shaun Harris collaborated with Lloyd in his newly formed band the Rogues, releasing the Harris-Lloyd composition \"Wanted: Dead or Alive\", on Fowley's Living Legend label. Shortly thereafter, with Danny Harris and drummer John Ware in the fold, Lloyd and Shaun formed the Laughing Wind, which recorded the single \"Good to Be Around\" for Tower Records later that year. Recordings made or produced by these pre-WCPAEB acts were collected years later on the compilation album, \"The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band Companion\" in 2011.\n\nMarkley became motivated by the large crowd a rock band like the Yardbirds attracted, particularly the number of teenage girls, and proposed he would finance and secure a recording contract for the Laughing Wind, in exchange for his inclusion into the group. Impressed and slightly seduced by the much older Markley's wealth and entourage, the band accepted his offer. The decision to record as the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band, rather than the Laughing Wind, was made by Markley, who envisioned the band as a west coast counterpart to the Velvet Underground. Looking to have something tangible to represent the band, in 1966, the WCPAEB released their debut album on Markley's FiFo label, \"Volume One\". Much of the album was recorded at Lloyd's personal studio and a rented store-front on La Cienega Boulevard, before Markley joined the group; however, tracks such as \"Don't Break My Balloon\" and \"If You Want This Love\" indicate he had some influence over the later sessions for the album's development. While \"Volume One\" did feature a small selection of original material, the majority of the album was cover versions including \"Louie Louie\", \"You Really Got Me\", and \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\".\n\nThe WCPAEB embarked on their first tour in June 1966, establishing themselves as a live favorite with Los Angeles hippies at venues such as the Other Place and Wild Thing. The group shared the bill with the Mothers of Invention, the Seeds, Iron Butterfly, and the Yardbirds, among others. According to Ware, the group's performances were \"the ultimate street happening for a while\"; highlighted by their ambitious psychedelic light show, which was operated by Buddy Walters, who also arranged light shows for Jimi Hendrix and the Animals. In a review of a gig in 1967, the \"Los Angeles Free Press\" commended the WCPAEB's musicianship, but was critical of Markley for his \"hypster\" attitude and non-rhythmic tambourine playing. Although his bandmates did not like his pretentious on and off-stage antics, Markley did manage to negotiate a three-album deal with talent scouts of Reprise Records who had attended WCPAEB's performances.\n\nIn May 1967, the band recorded and released their first album for Reprise, \"Part One\". By the time recording sessions began, Markley had assumed absolute control of the WCPAEB's publishing rights, which explains his unusual selection for the A-side of the album's singles: a \"spoken rap\" composition \"1906\", co-penned with session musician Ron Morgan, and a cover of the Mothers of Invention's song \"Help, I'm a Rock\". The album itself featured songs that exhibited a wide-ranging stylistic variety, including Byrds-esque folk rock, garage rock, and Baroque pop. The song \"I Won't Hurt You\" was one of two compositions (the other being \"If You Want This Love\") from the group's debut album re-recorded for \"Part One\", where it was given a much more subdued atmosphere and a heartbeat rhythm. Shaun Harris sang the reworked version of \"I Won't Hurt You\", rather than Lloyd, who, aside from some backing vocals on the album, would not sing lead on a WCPAEB release until the 1969 album \"Where's My Daddy?\".\n\nMarkley and Lloyd did not get on, which led to the latter leaving the group and Morgan joining full-time. According to Lloyd, Markley became increasingly overbearing on the WCPAEB's creative output, and \"he started to believe that he was like, you know, the real deal, as opposed to the guy who doesn't sing and doesn't really have any musical thoughts and stuff like that. He wasn't content anymore just being the guy who ended up with the girls that he could get from it\". Lloyd remained in Los Angeles and participated in a number of studio projects with Fowley and Mike Curb such as October Country, the Smoke, St. John Green, and the Fire Escape.\n\nIn August 1967, just prior to recording sessions for the WCPAEB's third Reprise album, Shaun Harris took a hiatus from the band. His departure was partly due to his disillusionment with the group, primarily with the WCPAEB's lack of success, and it served as a waiting period while his brother, Danny, was being treated for depression. He formed the California Spectrum with Danny, Lloyd, and Jimmy Greenspoon. The group toured the Midwest with Markley's state-of-the-art light show, and released two singles in its brief recording career, \"Sassafras\" (the same version featured on \"Volume One\") and a cover of the Left Banke's \"She May Call You Up Tonight\", none of which were met with much attention. When Harris returned to the WCPAEB in 1968, he touted a completely different line-up, and promoted the California Spectrum with his column in the teen zine \"Tiger Beat\" until the group disbanded sometime in early 1969.\n\nIn late 1967, the WCPAEB released their third album, \"Vol. 2 (Breaking Through)\", which was the band's most ambitious, albeit less consistent than its predecessor, work to date. The album featured a peculiar cover photo of Markley and the Harris brothers sitting bare-chested in a silver bathroom, and a bold declaration on the backside: \"Every song in this album has been written, arranged, sung and played by the group. No one censored us. We got to say everything we wanted to say, in the way we wanted to say it\". For the first time, each track was credited either in whole or in part to members of the WCPAEB; however, Markley's manic narratives and questionable lyrical content (particularly young girls) dominate the record. An edited version of the Morgan-Markley composition \"Smell of Incense\" was issued just ahead of \"Vol. 2 (Breaking Through)\", but it failed to chart. The Dallas psychedelic pop group Southwest FOB covered the song in 1968, which reached No. 56 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Among its ten tracks, the album included the politically-satirical \"In the Arena\", possibly inspired by the Watts riots. \"Vol. 2 (Breaking Through)\" also features the anti-war song \"Suppose They Gave a War and No One Comes\", the full version of \"Smell of Incense\", and a rare instance of Markley singing is found on \"Unfree Child\".\n\nThe WCPAEB's fourth album \"\" was released in July 1968. The album represented a creative leap forward for the band and is often considered their most accomplished work. Band biographer Tim Forster described \"Volume 3\" as the group's \"most extraordinary achievement\", one which utilized a \"bizarre fusion of innocence and malice\" heavily affected by the \"exuberance of the British Invasion, folk rock, and flower power-era\" being \"swept away in a tide of bad drugs, paranoia, and protest\". The album also saw Morgan experimenting with the droning quality of the electric sitar, featured prominently on \"Ritual #1\", \"Until the Poorest of People Have Money\", the title track, and \"Ritual #2\". In addition, \"Volume 3\"'s front cover design showcased the \"butterfly mind\" artwork of John Van Hamersveld, who also is credited with the covers of \"Crown of Creation\", \"Exile on Main St.\", and \"Magical Mystery Tour\". Like the WCPAEB's earlier albums, \"Volume 3\" failed to sell in sufficient quantities to reach the U.S. charts, and Reprise dropped the band.\n\nLate in 1968, Jimmy Bowen established his label Amos Records and signed the group the following year. While the band worked on the \"Where's My Daddy?\" album, Danny Harris rejoined and Lloyd returned to provide backing vocals and co-write \"Where's My Daddy?\", \"Where Money Rules Everything\", and \"Coming of Age in L.A.\" with Markley. It became apparent on the album, however, that the echoing vocal harmonies found on the band's preceding works were replaced by a closely-miked sound. The album loosely possessed the components of a concept piece, narrated through the eyes of a young homeless girl named \"Poor Patty\" as she journeys through the chaos of post-Summer of Love Los Angeles. However, \"Where's My Daddy?\", as well as its accompanying single \"Free as Bird\", failed to reverse the WCPAEB's commercial fortunes, and it is regarded by critics and fans as the group's most lackluster album release.\n\nLloyd negotiated with Curb to distribute the group's fifth and final album on Forward Records. Released in 1970, Markley insisted the album, originally self-titled, should be released under the name \"Markley, A Group\". The album benefited from the full involvement and production experience of Lloyd, who sang the majority of the lead vocals, provided keyboards, and organized the orchestral arrangements. Danny Harris was a key influence on the album, writing half of its tracks. However, although the album is generally considered an improvement over \"Where's My Daddy?\", the group could no longer cope with Markley's erratic behavior, and disbanded soon after the album's release.\n\nMarkley continued his playboy lifestyle at a beach house he purchased in Los Angeles. He produced Jim Stallings' (J. J. Light) European hit \"Heya\" and the album of the same name before vanishing from the music business. According to various accounts by band members and Fowley, in 1972 Markley had evaded imprisonment and kept a low-profile after an incident involving two underage girls. Markley sporadically contacted his former bandmates; however, Fowley recollected a conversation with Stallings in 1992: \"He [Stallings] told me that Bob had been sitting in this rowing boat on a lake near Las Vegas - he was like a recluse. It got loose from its moorings and he drifted off alone for a day and a half. He was already pretty messed up, but he got very badly dehydrated. When they eventually found him he was taken to some hospital and placed on a life-support system, unable to speak or think\". Markley died on September 9, 2003 in a hospital in Gardena, California; he was 68.\n\nAt age 20, Curb appointed Lloyd vice-president of MGM Records. In the 1970s, he became a successful record producer for teen idols, including the Osmonds, Shaun Cassidy, and Leif Garrett. In 1986, he was music supervisor for the soundtrack of the film \"Dirty Dancing\", and has been involved in several other movie soundtracks well into the 2000s. Shaun Harris collaborated with Lloyd to release Harris's self-titled debut solo album in 1973, which explored his country rock influences. Later on, he became the president of Barry Manilow's publishing company and most recently Harris has written a play about his life. Although Danny Harris was initially disillusioned with the music industry, he recorded the gospel album \"Thank Him Every Day\" in 1980. He also worked as a folk musician and actor before dying on the set of \"Saving Mr. Banks\" from a heart attack on October 1, 2012. Morgan helped found Three Dog Night (though left before they found commercial success) and joined the Electric Prunes for their album \"Just Good Old Rock and Roll\". He died in 1989 aged 44.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2267418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267418", "title": "Sucrose gap", "text": "Sucrose gap\n\nThe sucrose gap technique is used to create a conduction block in nerve or muscle fibers. A high concentration of sucrose is applied to the extracellular space, which prevents the correct opening and closing of sodium and potassium channels, increasing resistance between two groups of cells. It was originally developed by Robert Stämpfli for recording action potentials in nerve fibers, and is particularly useful for measuring irreversible or highly variable pharmacological modifications of channel properties since untreated regions of membrane can be pulled into the node between the sucrose regions.\n\nThe sucrose gap technique was first introduced by in 1954 who worked with Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley between 1947 and 1949. From his research, Stämpfli determined that currents moving along nerve fibers can be measured more easily when there is a gap of high resistance that reduces the amount of conducting medium outside of the cell. Stämpfli observed many problems with the ways that were being used to measure membrane potential at the time. He experimented with a new method that he called the sucrose gap. The method was used to study action potentials in nerve fibers.\n\nHuxley observed Stämpfli's method and agreed that it was useful and produced very few errors. The sucrose gap technique also contributed to Stämpfli's and Huxley's discovery of inhibitory junction potentials. Since its introduction, many improvements and alterations have been made to the technique. One modification of the single sucrose gap method was introduced by C.H.V. Hoyle in 1987.\nThe double sucrose gap technique, which was first used by Rougier, Vassort, and Stämpfli to study cardiac cells in 1968, was improved by C. Leoty and J. Alix who introduced an improved chamber for the double sucrose gap with voltage clamp technique which eliminated external resistance from the node.\n\nA classic sucrose gap technique is typically set up with three chambers that each contain a segment of the neuron or cells that are being studied. The test chamber contains a physiological solution, such as Krebs or Ringer's solution, which mimics the ion concentration and osmotic pressure of the cell's natural environment. Test drugs can also be added to this chamber to study the effect that they have on cellular function. Ag-AgCl or platinum wire electrodes are generally used for stimulating the cells in the test solution. The sucrose chamber (or gap) is the middle chamber that separates the two other chambers, or sections of the nerve fiber or cells. This chamber contains an isotonic sucrose solution of a high specific resistance. Specific resistance describes the ability of a material or solution to oppose electric current, so a sucrose solution of a high specific resistance is effective in electrically isolating the three chambers. The third chamber usually contains a KCl solution that mimics the intracellular solution. The high potassium concentration in this chamber depolarizes the immersed segment of the tissue, allowing potential differences to be measured between the two segments separated by the sucrose gap. Vaseline, silicon grease, or a silicon-vaseline mixture is used to seal the nerve or tissue in position and prevent diffusion of solution between the chambers. A pair of agar-bridged Ag-AgCl electrodes are placed in the test and KCl chambers to record the changes in membrane potential.\n\nThe single sucrose gap technique is used to study the electrical activity of cells. It is useful in the study of small nerve fibers and electrically connected cells such as smooth muscle cell. The method creates conduction block in a nerve or muscle fiber by introducing a gap of high resistance between two groups of cells. A nonionic sucrose solution is used to increase resistance in the extracellular area between the two groups. This allows all of the current originating on one side of the gap to flow to the other side only through the interior of the nerve or tissue. Changes in electrical potential between the two groups relative to each other can be measured and recorded.\n\nAlterations have been made to the single sucrose gap technique. One modification is called the double sucrose gap technique. This is used to measure resistance and membrane potential at the same time. Two chambers containing sucrose solutions are used to isolate a node of the nerve or tissue, which is immersed in a physiological solution. The two ends of the nerve or tissue are depolarized by a solution rich in potassium ions. The potential differences between the node, or test chamber, and one of the potassium-rich chambers can be measured, while the potential in the node can be modified by the current degenerated between the other potassium-rich chamber and the node. The information that is obtained can be used, along with the Ohm's law equation, to determine the membrane resistance of the cells within the node. The double sucrose gap can be used as a voltage clamp as well. When used with proper electronics, the double sucrose gap can be used to voltage clamp the membrane potential of the nerve or tissue segment contained in the test chamber.\n\nThe sucrose gap technique allows ion currents to be measured in multicellular tissues. Although voltage clamp and patch clamp methods are also effective in studying the functions of neurons, the sucrose gap technique is easier to perform and less expensive. Furthermore, the sucrose gap technique can provide stable recordings from small cells, such as nerve fibers or smooth muscle cells, for an extended period of time. It is very complicated, however, to achieve similar measurements with intracellular or patch-clamp electrodes because they can physically damage small axons or cells. Because of the arrangement of the sucrose gap chambers, the technique of stimulating the neuron or cell is simple and reliable. This method is also useful in studying the changes in membrane potential in response to different pharmacologically active agents, which can be introduced in the test chamber.\n\nA major limitation of the single sucrose gap is that it cannot determine the real values of the membrane potential and action potential amplitudes. It can only measure the relative changes in the potential between the regions separated by the sucrose solution because of the shunting effect. Double sucrose gap, however, can measure the membrane potential and resistance. Another limitation is that membrane potentials cannot be obtained from tissues where there is no electrical coupling between the cells (i.e. when the spatial constant, λ, is close to zero). Also, the sucrose solution, which has a low ionic concentration, can deplete the exposed cells of vital intracellular ions such as sodium and potassium, which can affect their viability. This can cause the membrane to become hyperpolarized and affect the conduction of action potentials along the cell. Despite these limitations, the many advantages of the sucrose gap method makes it a useful and reliable technique in neuroscience studies.\n\nThe sucrose-gap technique is used to record membrane activities from myelinated nerves, unmyelinated nerves, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle. Along with microelectrode methods and patch-clamp methods, the sucrose gap is often used by experimenters to study the nervous system and can serve as an effective method to investigate the effects of drugs on membrane activities. Studies on the effects of choline, acetylcholine, and carbachol on the resting potentials of the superior cervical ganglion in rabbits were conducted using the sucrose-gap method. The recording of membrane potentials in the superior cervical ganglion was made simple with the sucrose-gap method as it allows for separated depolarizing of the ganglion and the internal carotid nerve.\n\nThe sucrose-gap technique has been applied to determine the relation between external potassium concentration and the membrane potential of smooth muscle cells using guinea-pig ureters. It has also been used to rectify inaccurate membrane potential measurements resulting from leakage currents through the membrane and extracellular resistance. Correction of an inaccurate membrane current reading is also possible through utilization of the sucrose-gap method.\n\nDevelopments in the sucrose-gap method have led to double sucrose-gap techniques. A double sucrose-gap is generally advantageous when used to electrically isolate smaller segments of nerve fibers than would be possible with a single sucrose-gap, as was done in studies on membrane potentials and currents in sheep and calf ventricular muscle fibers. The double sucrose-gap technique is also utilized over the single sucrose-gap to study cardiac muscle, where it allows for clearer resolution of early currents, those occurring within the first 10-100 milliseconds of depolarization.\n"}

He served as Additional Solicitor General of India (December 1989 – December 1990) and President of the Supreme Court Bar Association on three occasions (1995–96, 1997–98 and 2001–2002). In 2004 general elections, he won the Chandni Chowk constituency of New Delhi with 71% vote share. In 2014 general elections, he received 18% of the votes and trailed at third position for Chandni Chowk constituency, behind.\n\nSibal was born on 8 August 1948 in Jalandhar in Punjab. His family migrated to India during the partition in 1947. Kapil Sibal moved to Delhi in 1964. After his schooling from St John's High School, he joined St. Stephen's college, University of Delhi, he earned his LL.B degree from Faculty of Law, University of Delhi, and later an M.A. in history. He joined the bar association in 1972. In the year 1973, he qualified for Indian Administrative Services and was offered an appointment. But he declined the offer and decided to set up his own law practice. Afterwards, he attended the Harvard Law School where he enrolled for an LL.M. which he completed in 1977. He was designated as senior lawyer in 1983. In 1989, he was appointed the Additional Solicitor General of India. In 1994, he was the only lawyer to appear in the Parliament, and successfully defended a Supreme Court judge during impeachment proceedings. The impeachment motion was placed in the assembly for debate and voting on 10 May 1993. Of 401 members present in the assembly that day, there were 196 votes for impeachment and no votes against and 205 abstentions by ruling Congress and its allies.

He has also contributed several articles on various prominent issues such as security, nuclear proliferation, and terrorism in national dailies and periodicals. In the 2004 general elections, Sibal became an MP by winning the Chandni Chowk constituency against TV actor Smriti Irani of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the National Capital Territory representing the Congress Party and was inducted into the Cabinet under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as Union Minister for Science, Technology and Earth Sciences. He won the constituency of Chandni Chowk for the second time for the Indian National Congress in the Lok Sabha elections of 2009.\n\nOver the years, he has held several important positions in the Government of India and the Society, such as: Additional Solicitor General of India (December 1989 – 1990); Member, Board of Management, Indira Gandhi National Open University (1993); President, Supreme Court Bar Association (1995–96, 1997–98 and 2001–2002); Member, Rajya Sabha (July 1998); Member, Executive Council, Institute of Constitutional and Parliamentary Studies (July, 2001); Member, Business Advisory Committee (August, 2001); Member, Committee on Home Affairs (January, 2002); Co-chairman, Indo-US Parliamentary Forum (2002); Member, Board of International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (2002); Member, Programme Board of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's Indian AIDS initiative (2003); Member, Working Group on Arbitrary Detention set up by the Human Rights Commission, Geneva.\n\nDuring his tenure as Telecom Minister his comment about the loss in the 2G spectrum case being only notional and causing \"zero loss\" created a public outcry and he had to clarify it later. Kapil Sibal was indicted by CAG for favoring M/S Phoenix Rose LLC by overlooking rules and regulations and handpicking that company for creating a database for over 500,000 working professionals of People of Indian Origin settled in the US. CAG's report said that the project's cost was $ but three years after the initiation, the company has dumped the networking site, completing just over 16% of the targeted work.\n\nAlso during his time in that office, his move to regulate internet content was criticized across many social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter and Google+.\n\nHe represented India in the Annual Meetings of the World Economic Forum in 2005 and 2009 held at Davos, Switzerland. He led the Indian delegation to the Annapolis Conference, USA, held to gather International support for establishment of a Palestinian state and the realization of Israeli–Palestinian peace during November 2007. He led the Indian delegation to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at Bali in December 2007.\n\nSibal approved the creation of an Indian Institute of Technology Muddenahalli as part of the 11th 5 year plan.\nHe is also the person who introduced the Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) system in India for Class IX and Class X and he has also started the changes in the IIT JEE pattern.

{"id": "2267424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267424", "title": "Beck's cognitive triad", "text": "Beck's cognitive triad\n\nBeck's cognitive triad, also known as the negative triad, is a cognitive-therapeutic view of the three key elements of a person's belief system present in depression. It was proposed by Aaron Beck in 1976. The triad forms part of his cognitive theory of depression and the concept is used as part of CBT, particularly in Beck's \"Treatment of Negative Automatic Thoughts\" (TNAT) approach.\n\nThe triad involves \"automatic, spontaneous and seemingly uncontrollable negative thoughts\" about:\n\nExamples of this negative thinking include:\n\nFrom a cognitive perspective, depressive disorders are characterized by people's dysfunctional negative views of themselves, their life experience (and the world in general), and their future—the cognitive triad.\n\nPeople with depression often view themselves as unlovable, helpless, doomed or deficient. They tend to attribute their unpleasant experiences to their presumed physical, mental, and/or moral deficits. They tend to feel excessively guilty, believing that they are worthless, blameworthy, and rejected by self and others. They may have a very difficult time viewing themselves as people who could ever succeed, be accepted, or feel good about themselves and this may lead to withdrawal and isolation, which further worsens the mood. \n\nBeck proposes that those with depression develop cognitive distortions, a type of cognitive bias sometimes also referred to as faulty or unhelpful thinking patterns. Beck referred to some of these biases as \"automatic thoughts\", suggesting they are not entirely under conscious control. People with depression will tend to quickly overlook their positive attributes and disqualify their accomplishments as being minor or meaningless. They may also misinterpret the care, good will, and concern of others as being based on pity or susceptible to being lost easily if those others knew the “real person\" and this fuels further feelings of guilt. The main cognitive distortions according to Beck are summarised below:\n\nDepressed people view their lives as devoid of pleasure or reward, presenting insuperable obstacles to achieving their important goals. This is often manifested as a lack of motivation and leads to the depressed person feeling further withdrawal and isolation as they may be seen as lazy by others. Everything seems and feels “too hard to manage” and other people are seen as punishing (or potentially so). They believe that their troubles will continue indefinitely, and that the future will only bring further hardship, deprivation, and frustration. “Paralysis of the will” results from the depressed patients' pessimism and hopelessness. Expecting their efforts to end in failure, they are reluctant to commit themselves to growth-oriented goals, and their activity level drops. Believing that they cannot affect the outcome of various situations, they experience a desire to avoid such situations.\n\nSuicidal wishes are seen as an extreme expression of the desire to escape from problems that appear to be uncontrollable, interminable, and unbearable.\n\nBeck also believed that a depressed person will, often from childhood experiences, hold a negative self-schema. This schema may originate from negative early experiences, such as criticism, abuse or bullying. Beck suggests that people with negative self-schemata are liable to interpret information presented to them in a negative manner, leading to the cognitive distortions outlined above. The pessimistic explanatory style, which describes the way in which depressed or neurotic people react negatively to certain events, is an example of the effect of these schemata on self-image. This explanatory style involves blaming oneself for negative events outside of their control or the behaviour of others (personalisation), believing that such events will continue forever and letting these events significantly affect their emotional wellbeing.\n\nA number of instruments have been developed to attempt to measure negative cognition in the three areas of the triad. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a well-known questionnaire for scoring depression based on all three aspects of the triad. Other examples include the Beck Hopelessness Scale for measuring thoughts about the future and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale for measuring views of the self. The Cognitive Triad Inventory (CTI) was developed by Beckham \"et al.\" to attempt to systematically measure the three aspects of Beck's triad. The CTI aims to quantify the relationship between \"therapist behaviour in a single treatment session to changes in the cognitive triad\" and \"patterns of changes to the triad to changes in overall depressive mood\". This inventory has since been adapted for use with children and adolescents in the CTI-C, developed by Kaslow \"et al.\" \n\n"}

The wrestling school operated after the same principles of a university, divided into classes with several terms where wrestlers would \"graduate\" (debut) at the same time. The Ultimo Dragon Gym's first graduating term consisted of Cima, Don Fujii, Dragon Kid, Magnum Tokyo and Suwa who collectively became known as \"Toryumon Japan\" (a name that would be used for the first four terms). Toryumon promoted their first show on May 11, 1997, in Naucalpan, Mexico on a show that was co-promoted with International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG). Toryumon and IWRG would co-promote shows in Japan from 1997 until 2001, allowing the Ultimo Dragon Gym graduates to work on IWRG shows and even saw several graduates wrestlers win IWRG Championship. Through his contacts with WCW Último Dragón also arranged for some of his first term graduates to wrestle on World Championship Wrestling shows. On January 1, 1999, Toryumon held its first show in Japan and from that point forward began promoting regular shows in Japan. Toryumon's combination of traditional Japanese Puroresu, Mexican Lucha Libre and elements of Sports Entertainment that Último Dragón had observed while working for WCW such as outside interference and referee's being knocked out, something that at the time was not traditionally used in Japanese wrestling. The second class of Último Dragón Gym graduates began their own promotion, called the Toryumon 2000 Project, or T2P for short. The T2P promotion debuted on November 13, 2001, and became known for their use of the six-sided wrestling ring, the first promotion to regularly use such a ring shape. T2P wrestlers primarily used a submission based style called \"Llave\" (Spanish for \"Key\" the lucha libre term for submission locks). T2P ran until January 27, 2003, when the roster was absorbed into Toryumon. The third graduating class was known as \"Toryumon X\" and like T2P also started their own promotion under their class name. Toryumon X made its debut on August 22, 2003, and lasted until early 2004.\n\nÚltimo Dragón had been forced to retire from active competition in 1998 after a mistake during an elbow surgery that caused nerve damage. In 2001 Dragón had another round of surgery on his elbow, restoring mobility and feeling. Following his rehabilitation Último Dragón made his return to active wrestling on a Toryumon / T2P co-promoted pay-per-view on September 8, 2002. In the following months Dragón wrestled regularly for Toryumon and various companies around the world. Because of his active scheduled Último Dragón stepped down as the director of Toryumon leaving the job to Takashi Okamura. Okamura handled the job while Dragón began working full-time for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in the United States. After his run with WWE ended Dragón returned to Japan and announced that he was leaving Toryumon and taking all the trademarks he owned with him. Toryumon Japan changed its name to Dragon Gate as a result of this, continuing the traditions of Toryumon Japan including references to Último Dragón. Since the break Toryumon has primarily promoted shows in Mexico, featuring students trained by Dragón and Jorge \"Skayde\" Rivera and a number of wrestlers from various Mexican and American promotions.\n\nIn Japan a group of remaining Toryumon students, including ousted members of Dragon Gate, joined with the internet-firm Livedoor to create the promotion dragondoor, a promotion that only ran six shows. The group launched another wrestling venture in 2006 called El Dorado: Next Door Project.\n\nToryumon Japan ran a series of PPVs under the names \"Vamonos Amigos\" (\"Let's go friends\" in Spanish) and \"Revolucion\" (\"Revolution\") as well as an annual anniversary show. They also held an annual \"Numero Uno\" League that became one of the highlights of the promotional year. Since the split in 2004 Toryumon has not promoted any major shows or PPVs, focusing their promotional efforts on Toryumon Mexico. In Mexico Dragón promotes an annual DragonMania show, with the last being DragonMania XI held on May 28, 2016.\nIn August 2017 Toryumon Mexico started working with All Japan Pro Wrestling in with a collaborated event tour called Lucha Fiesta.\n\nBefore the Dragon Gate split in 2004 Toryumon Japan promoted a series of championships, only one of which originated in the promotion, Último Dragón Gym Championship, the rest were either bought from its previous owner or acquired after promotions closed. When the promotion turned to Dragon Gate all its championships were vacated, leaving only the Toryumon Mexico promoted titles.\n\nSuzuki Cup is a Team Tournament that began in 2007\n\n\nEvery year Toryumon Mexico holds the Young Dragons Cup, an annual tournament that began in 1997. The tournament is used to showcas Dragon Gym students. Originally it was a traditional single-elimination tournament, in 2006 it was changed into a \"torneo cibernetico\" and has had that format ever since. Rocky Romero, Kota Ibushi, Ryuji Yamaguchi and Trauma II are the only tournament winners who were not actually trained by Último Dragón.\n\n\nToryumon Mexico holds the Yamaha Cup about once a year, although there have been years without a Cup.

Prospector, performer, and con man Walter Scott, born in Cynthiana, Kentucky, also known as \"Death Valley Scotty,\" convinced Chicago millionaire Albert Mussey Johnson to invest in Scott's gold mine in the Death Valley area. Though initially angered when the mine turned out to be fraudulent, Johnson was fascinated with the colorful Scott and the two men struck up an unlikely friendship. By 1937, Johnson had acquired more than in Grapevine Canyon, where the ranch is located.\n\nAfter Johnson and his wife Bessie made several trips to the region, and his health improved, construction began. It was Mrs. Johnson's idea to build something comfortable for their vacations in the area, and the villa eventually became a winter home.\n\nThe Johnsons hired Martin de Dubovay as the architect, Mat Roy Thompson as the engineer and head of construction, and Charles Alexander MacNeilledge as the designer.\n\nUnknown to the Johnsons, the initial survey was incorrect, and the land they built Death Valley Ranch on was actually government land; their land was farther up Grapevine Canyon. Construction halted as they resolved this mistake, but before it could resume, the stock market crashed in 1929, making it difficult for Johnson to finish construction. Having lost a considerable amount of money, the Johnsons used the Death Valley Ranch to produce income by letting rooms out, upon the suggestion of Scott.\n\nThe Johnsons died without heirs and had hoped that the National Park Service would purchase the property, and in 1970, the National Park Service purchased the villa for $850,000 from the Gospel Foundation (the socially-oriented charity Johnson founded in 1946), to which the Johnsons had left the property.\nWalter Scott, who was taken care of by the Gospel Foundation after Johnson's passing, died in 1954 and was buried on the hill overlooking Scotty's Castle next to a beloved dog.\n\nApproximately 100,000 people tour the villa each year. The Johnsons' original furnishings and clothing can still be seen today. The National Park Service gives guided tours of Scotty's Castle for a fee. Park rangers dress in 1930s style clothes to help take the visitor back in time. During the tour, guests are treated to the sounds of a 1,121-pipe Welte theater organ.\n\nAn underground mystery tour is also available for those wishing to see the inner workings of the building. One-quarter mile of tunnels run under the building, where visitors can visit the powerhouse and see thousands of tiles that were to be used for the never-finished swimming pool. The tunnels also contain hundreds of nickel-iron battery cells, used to regulate power and provide backup power. The main house tour is ADA accessible, but the underground tour is not.\n\nThe springs of Grapevine Canyon provided the water supply for the ranch and were used to generate electricity. The springs, located about higher than the villa, generated enough water flow and pressure to turn a Pelton wheel, which ran the generator that furnished the villa's electricity. The power was regulated and backed up by the large bank of nickel–iron batteries in the house's tunnels. The springs provided enough water to meet all the needs of the ranch, with enough left for other uses.\n\nA water fountain was constructed in the Great Hall, where water dripped down a rock face creating evaporative cooling and into a catch basin for recirculation. A 1930s solar hot water heater, much larger than today's solar water heaters, is near the main house, and a large stock of railroad ties salvaged from the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad is in the area.\n\nOn October 18, 2015 the Death Valley area was hit by a significant rain storm, receiving nearly 3 inches of rain as the storm stalled over the Grapevine Canyon area for five hours. Flash flooding struck Scotty's Castle, leaving mud and debris stacked along the perimeter of the structures, up to a foot high inside the visitor center, and the access road to the property was destroyed. The flood caused the property to be closed for an extended period of time while repairs to the property are carried out and a new access road is built. The NPS has stated that the castle itself is not likely to re-open to the public until 2021, though \"flood recovery tours\" of the grounds happened between December 2017 and April 14, 2018.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2267445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267445", "title": "The Story of the Night", "text": "The Story of the Night\n\nThe Story of the Night is a Bildungsroman by Irish novelist Colm Tóibín. The novel interweaves the personal story of Richard Garay, a gay Argentinian man with an English mother, and the political history of Argentina through the late 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nTold entirely in the first person, the novel presents a wholly convincing picture of a character who could almost be described as an anti-hero, and who distills not just the Argentinian but the global late 20th century mix of sexual and economic \"freedoms\" in a single life: a \"story of the night\" lights otherwise shadowy places.\n\nThe publisher's blurb puts emphasis on the first part of the novel, by focusing, in particular, on the protagonist's involvement in the Falklands War and by omitting important themes and topics such as AIDS that are revealed in the second and third parts. This suggest a willingness to mislead and attract potential readers into buying a book they might not otherwise consider.\n\nThe novel is split into three parts across various settings in Argentina and in Barcelona, and takes place in both domestic and public spaces.\n\n\nThe Story of the Night opens with a discussion of Richard's mother – her patriotism towards England before her death, and how Richard imagines she would have responded to the Falklands War. Richard experienced a lack of political awareness before the war when the generals were in power, but he recalls one time he was having sex with a dark-haired man and heard a revving sound outside. When Richard asked his partner what the noise was, he responded that the police station opposite were using a car to power cattle rods for torture.\n\nRichard attends university during the Dirty War. He befriends Jorge Canetto, the (straight) son of a wealthy family; he teaches Jorge English and develops a crush on him. He eventually confesses to Jorge that he is gay, to Jorge's disapproval. One evening his mother asks him if Jorge is gay and Richard, surprised, reveals his homosexuality to his mother.\n\nThe novel then flashes back to Richard's childhood. His mother's family immigrated from England to Argentina when she was a child and, as a result, Richard himself felt he was English growing up. After his father's death, he and his mother were left without funds. Richard's aunts and uncles on his father's side were stingy, and provided little money. His mother decided they would stay with her sister (Aunt Matilda) in Molino, but they soon discover that Matilda and her family are very poor. They are put up in a shed by Matilda's tiny cottage. In the following days, Richard's cousin takes him to play with other boys who live on the estate. Three of these boys take Richard to a barn where they all disrobe and masturbate together. Richard develops a crush on one of the boys (Juan), but discovers that there are rules to this \"game\" after Juan calls him \"queer\" for trying to kiss him. Eventually his Uncle and mother fall out, and so Richard and his mother move back to Buenos Aires. Back at home his mother finds a job working in a \"very refined\" hotel, and is given some money by the English community in Buenos Aires to tide her over.\n\nBack in the present-day, Richard attends university and his mother works in the hotel. Jorge invites Richard on a three-week visit to Barcelona, a friend of Jorge's had pulled out at the last minute. Whilst there, the two meet up with a group of young Chilean refugees from the Pinochet regime. Elena, one of the two Chilean girls, attaches herself to Jorge, but Jorge prefers the other girl, Maria Jose. Nonetheless, Jorge has sex with Elena every night. As Jorge and Richard are sharing a room, Jorge makes Richard pretend to be asleep whilst they are in the bed next to him.\n\nIt is revealed that two or three of the Chileans had been arrested and Raul, who had not been very political, had been tortured. Jorge sleeps with Maria Jose and then leaves Barcelona with her for a while. Richard continues to spend time with the Chileans and develops a crush on Raul. Elena gives Richard details about Raul's torture. She says that soon their group will be dispersed and they will have to settle in different places. Jorge and Maria Jose return and spend time alone away from the rest of the group. When it is time for Jorge and Richard to leave, Jorge gives the Chileans a fake address, in case they are arrested again. Jorge is afraid of what might happen if his address was found on them. Richard gives them his real address. They say goodbye and Richard and Jorge return to Argentina.\n\nRichard's mother seems much older and frailer than she did before he left for Spain. She begins to hate Argentina and wishes her father had stayed in England. She eventually becomes too incapacitated to work and so Richard gets a job teaching English. She has a stroke and loses her ability to speak. After a while she dies.\n\nRichard is emotionally numb for months after her death, but eventually begins to feel sexual desire again. He brings a man he met in the street back to his apartment. He starts to go to a sauna twice a week to meet other gay men.\n\nArgentina takes hold of the Malvinas. People treat Richard with a little suspicion due to his being half English, but Richard wholeheartedly supports Argentina.\n\nJorge's father, Senor Canetto, invites Richard to their house for dinner. There are a number of middle-aged army men in attendance, all of whom are Peronists. As negotiations fail and the Falkland war breaks out, Richard often goes to the Canetto's for dinner and to discuss politics and the war. The men at these dinners are certain that Argentina will win but Richard is sceptical. Richard feels a great sense of shame for his country when Britain wins the war. Richard is at these dinners when important political changes happen; when Alfonsin is elected president, when the generals are put on trial etc. Richard discovers that Canetto has political ambitions, and hopes for American funding. Canetto invites Richard to meet some American diplomats. These Americans are hosting receptions and need someone who can talk to them about democratic possibilities, and who can speak both Spanish and English.\n\n\nHe goes to a party where he meets these American diplomats; Susan and Donal Ford. Initially he represents Canetto's interests, Canetto plans to run for president and needs someone who speaks English to convince the diplomats to fund him. Richard finds that he changes into someone new, someone more confident and assured when he talks to them. After this party he meets with Susan privately where they talk intimately; Richard tells her about his parents deaths and his relationship with his father. He goes to dinner with Susan and Donald where they talk politics. Richard says he thinks Argentinians are more concerned with issues like economics, employment and welfare than they are about people disappearing. The three of them begin having drinks and dinner often. They talk about informal things and relax together.\n\nRichard begins to hate his teaching job. One day he goes to the sauna and seduces a young man, but this seduction takes a long time so Richard decides not to go to work that day. He and the man have sex, and then Richard goes to a movie alone during his evening classes. He tells the Ford's how he despises his job and Susan offers him a new job looking after a group of American economists. The economists are coming to Argentina to suggest ways the country can reduce spending so that they can pay debts. Richard doesn't go back to his teaching job, after two weeks he is given a cheque and a letter of dismissal. He stays in a hotel with the economists and works with them well.\n\nDonald talks to Richard about a potential job working towards the privatisation of the oil industry. Whilst at a dinner with the economists, Richard talks to a friend from university who had also been working with the economists. Richard had been discussing with the Americans how he didn't know anyone who had disappeared and that the disappearances weren't important to his life. His friend from university talks about his girlfriend who he is certain was murdered when she disappeared.\n\nRichard returns to his apartment and finds letters from Jorge. Senor Canetto is exasperated and impatient to know whether the Americans will fund him. He meets with Susan and shows her these letters. She suggests that Canetto have a fund-raising party which they will attend to get to know him. She tells him more about the work he will do in the Oil industry. Richard goes to the Canetto's house to tell them Susan's suggestion and he meets Jorge's brother Pablo for the first time Jorge sets up a tennis game – he and Pablo play against Richard and Donald.\n\nDonald and Richard begin playing tennis privately. After one game Donald puts his arms around Richard whilst they are both naked and tries to lift him up. When Donald sees that Richard has an erection his suspicion that Richard is gay is confirmed.\n\nThe Canettos throw their party, but Donald and Susan are unimpressed.\n\nRichard decides to go to a new sauna – it is Sunday and his usual one is closed. The new sauna is dingy, with a smell of rot and gay porn playing on a TV. In the changing rooms he runs into Pablo. Richard is desperate to talk to him, but cannot find him after Pablo disappears into the Sauna.\n\nDonald and Susan convince Richard to rent an office and become an independent consultant and translator. An oil tycoon, Frederico Arenas, offers Richard a job involving the \"transport\" of some goods, saying that no-one would question if these goods were called \"oil\" and transported as oil. Richard refuses his contract.\n\nSusan invites Richard for dinner while Donald is away. After dinner she brings him to her room. They both get naked and begin kissing but Richard cannot get an erection. Susan finds out he is gay. They cuddle in bed and Susan tells him that she was complicit in the overthrow in Chile. This upsets Richard as he remembers how Raul was tortured.\n\nFrederico Arenas calls Richard again, and Richard refuses his offer again.\n\nSusan finds out about a man running for president from La Rioja, his name is Menem. She asks Richard if he thinks Menem has a chance of winning the presidency. Richard flies out to meet her in La Rioja to check him out, and finds her there with Jorge. Jorge is unsubtle about his relationship with Susan, and the way he flaunts their affair echoes back to his actions in Barcelona.\n\nWhen Richard arrives home he agrees to Frederico Arenas's offer and becomes friends with him.\n\nRichard also becomes friends with Senor Canetto, who he tells about the oil industry. Canetto introduces Richard to an investment banker who will lend him large sums at a good rate of interest. They both invest in oil. Richard becomes incredibly rich through his investments, and his contract with Arenas.\n\nRichard attends dinner with the Canettos and runs into Pablo again. When Jorge and Pablo drive him to the train station after dinner, Pablo unties Richard's shoelaces in a flirty manner.\n\n\nPart three is shaped around Richard's relationship with Pablo. As this section opens, Richard's infatuation with Pablo grows, but he is still unsure as to whether Pablo reciprocates his feelings. Susan sets Richard up on a date with an American, and he is surprised when Charles (the American) asks him to use a condom during sex due to his fear about aids. He phones Pablo shortly after this encounter and they start dating. Pablo tells Richard the real reason he moved to America to study; the family maid walked in on Pablo having sex with his friend, and shortly afterwards his father pushed for him to go to America. Pablo never asked his father if the maid told him what had happened, but decided he would rather move than ask him.\n\nRichard and Pablo fall in love. When Richard takes Pablo to visit his parents grave he thinks that after years of missing them and being alone he is finally content. They spend a weekend in Motevideo together. Whilst there they go to a gay club where they can kiss and slow dance in public without fear of judgement.\n\nRichard sublets an upscale marina house from a US diplomat and invites Pablo to share it with him. They move in together, pretending to Pablo's family that he is only moving into the spare room so Richard can save on rent.\n\nPablo has two of his friends from California to stay, Mart and Jack who have been together for twelve years. When Pablo and Richard go to pick them up from the airport they learn that Mart has been treated badly by the airport security after they saw his AIDS medication. The four of them spend time together and Jack tells Richard that Pablo's ex-boyfriend died of aids, something which affected Pablo deeply. They think that Mart might have an infected line and take him to a doctor called Doctor Cawley. Before his friends leave, Pablo takes them and Richard to a restaurant and then to a bath-house where they scout for people to sleep with. Richard is initially reluctant to go to the bathhouse, but ends up enjoying sex with a stranger whilst there.\n\nDonald and Susan reveal that they will be leaving Argentina soon. At a tense dinner Donald asks Richard how long Susan and Jorge have been sleeping together, and Richard reveals to Susan that he has been dating Pablo.\n\nSusan and Donald have a farewell party. The next day Susan comes to say goodbye to Richard and they part. During this, it becomes clear that Mart is going to die and so Pablo decides to visit San Francisco where he and Jack live.\n\nRichard goes to Miami for work, and hooks up with Tom Shaw, a blonde American he'd met a few times during previous trips. Pablo phones Richard once, but then doesn't phone back or respond to any of Richard's calls. When Richard arrives home he sees that Pablo has moved out of their house, and left a note breaking up with him.\n\nRichard, devastated by the break-up, arranges to go to Tom Shaw's for the weekend and flies to New York. They do a lot of cocaine and have a lot of sex, but Tom is cold, only interested in physical gratification. Richard falls ill and decides he has to return to Argentina as soon as possible. On the flight home he cannot stop coughing, and is in agonising pain.\n\nRichard goes to the Hospital who tell him he has pneumonia. Whilst in the hospital he realises he doesn't have anyone to put as his emergency contact, and gives his dead mother's phone number and information. Doctor Cawley visits him and tells him he has Aids. Upon release from the hospital, he calls Susan and breaks down crying as he tells her of his illness. He moves back into his old apartment, goes back to work, and slowly becomes used to the fact that he is going to die.\n\nAfter his second meeting with Dr Cawley Richard runs into Pablo in the Doctor's waiting room. Pablo reveals that he was diagnosed with Aids during the weekend that Mart died. The pair lean on each other. Pablo has to stay in hospital to treat CMV, an eye disease that can cause blindness, and to have a line put in his chest. Richard visits him every day and when Pablo is released he takes him back to their house. The book ends as with Pablo deciding to live with Richard for a while, in their house by the Marina.\n\n\nTóibín's work regularly explores the themes of living abroad, creativity and personal identity, focusing especially on homosexual identity, and on identity when confronted with loss.\n\nGaray's identity is complex and layered. His homosexuality is for the most part hidden; he has mixed origins (an English mother); his class status is fragile (he and his mother are middle class but impoverished); he is affected, like all Argentinians, by the atmosphere of fear marking the years of military dictatorship; the neoliberal turn in Argentina provides him with the opportunity to adopt new identities but they come across as just that – adopted.\n\nOther figures in the novel have an impact on Richard's expression of his own identity. He is son, brother, colleague, friend, and lover throughout the novel and at different stages, but his sexuality remains a certainty.\n\nThe relationship with his mother, her alienation, deterioration, and ultimately her death can be seen as the rejection of his British identity for an acceptance of his homosexuality and identity as an Argentinian (and not half British) man. His mother embodied binary heteronormative behaviour, embracing Britishness and heterosexuality, and was dismissive of any sense of the \"other\". The alienation from the mother figure in favour of proximity with his partner Pablo, and other lovers, reinforces a negative portrayal of the constraints within a mother-son relationship.\n\nRichard describes how in his youth he flirted with cross-dressing and a female persona. As an adult he is attracted to distinctly masculine men. He enjoys working with the American businessmen and ‘mimicking their masculinity’ as it gives him a sense of control. With his lover Pablo however, he finds himself able to be gentle and protective and to elicit the same responses from Pablo. His sexual responses to male figures in the novel are noticeably aesthetic, in that the attraction is primarily physical before anything else. The portrayals are realistic and allow the reader to fully appreciate the development of the romantic relationship between Pablo and Richard when it happens.\n\nOverriding the novel is the polarised political situation of Argentina which is dominated by the masculine. The portrayal of the family is strictly nuclear, and all those who have the potential to be considered as powerful in Argentina are men with subordinate wives. Susan, although in a position of equality with her husband, is portrayed as conforming to a typically patriarchal view of women by attempting to seduce Richard, and later Jorge. She becomes a seductress with a strong sexual appetite and cannot just remain a diplomat in her own right.\n\nRichard's mother's preoccupation with Englishness is a mirror of her failure to flourish in Argentina, particularly once her Argentinian husband has died leaving her reliant on the limited charity of in-laws and the local Anglican church, in particular its vicar. Mother and son live together in a shabby apartment, but Richard distances himself from his mother's outlook. This may be in part because of his concealed homosexuality, which she only becomes aware of shortly before she dies. The Falkland War follows soon after. Richard's responds as a patriotic Argentinian, even though his acquaintances at times are concerned for him, given his part-English origins. Richard's bilingualism opens the way to many opportunities but they draw him into the orbit of the United States, not England, about which he exhibits neither interest nor a desire to visit.\n\nCostello-Sullivan argues that, as with other Toibin novels, Argentina as the setting with its  \"social and political exclusions\" and the \"representation of Argentina’s oppressive, silencing polity invariably resonates with the Irish context\" (97-98).\n\nIn an important discussion, the Chilean refugees acquaint Richard with their experiences when the Allende government was overthrown. In particular Raul's torture at the hands of the incoming Pinochet regime is detailed. Richard realizes he has always averted his gaze from evidence of police and official brutality in then military-ruled Argentina, the era of the Dirty War. At other points of the book two instances are detailed. The first occurs when Richard is having sex against a backdrop of noise from car engines revving and then being told by his pickup that the cars were powering cattle prods used to torture suspects at the police station opposite: \"I still do not know if what he said was true . . . I did not pay much attention [then], I remember the pleasure of standing at the window with him, my hands running down his back, more than anything else.\" (p. 8). Years later an acquaintance from his university days, Francisco, challenges Richard over his seeming indifference to the disappearance and likely death of one of their fellow students at the hands of the authorities – Richard claims ignorance (pp 118–20). Later again, Susan Ford confesses to Richard that she was working for US intelligence in Santiago at the time of the overthrow of Allende (albeit in a subordinate role). Only years on did she fully realize her complicity in what happened at that time (pp 157–58). The theme is never fully worked out – that is, Richard does not become more morally aware in the course of the novel, unless his loyalty to Pablo could be so construed. The theme seems to be used to signal how morally numbed an individual can become living in a police state, or perhaps in almost any circumstances.\n\nThe two Americans, Susan and Donald Ford, are exemplary of the US wish to incorporate post-military Argentina into the US-led liberal world order. This includes shoring up a democratic political system but one which would not allow the return of Peronism, Argentina's mid-century experiment in radical (but more or less democratic) economic nationalism, to which the US had always been hostile. Lacking any strong political attachment Richard goes along with this, in part because he is made to see (a telling episode comes when he assists some visiting IMF officials: \"did I know, they asked me that the train system of Buenos Aires lost five time its annual revenue?\", p 115) that the existing political economy of Argentina was deeply corrupt. On another occasion he himself becomes complicit in a corrupt transaction. Rueful after the event, he is told some time later by Federico, his accomplice, that \"things were different now . . . every move you make is watched, everything is countersigned\" (p 245). At one point during the lobbying over the privatization of the country's oil industry, Richard becomes convinced that the privatization would be bad for Argentina (p 260), but the insight is not further developed nor does it lead to any change of course on Richard's part.\n\nThe novel was published in 1996, at a time when new drugs, in particular AZT and protease inhibitors, were holding out the possibility of living rather than dying with HIV/AIDS. The novel captures a time – from the mid 1980s to the mid-1990s – when AIDS was not only deadly and fearsome but played havoc with many for whom neither their sexuality, nor the cause or character of their ill-health, could be disclosed to their families. No explicit parallel is drawn between this phase of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the advent of economic liberalism in Argentina, but it could be argued that Richard's ignorance to the devastation wrought by the Dirty War and his ignorance to the HIV/AIDS epidemic operate in conjunction with one another.\n\nThe use of space in the novel is important in highlighting the sexual repression in Argentinian society. Richard initially seeks comfort from the space provided by the saunas during the novel, as a place where he can express his sexuality and seek refuge from the external stress of his daily life. His apartment after the death of his mother acts as a place for Richard to return to the reality of his life before his social and economic advancements; but soon becomes a place of stagnancy and deterioration from which he longs to escape. Likewise, the saunas become another setting for the expression of the silence, isolation, and uncertainty that was congruent with being homosexual at the time. As Tóibín notes, \"…while I was there, I kept meeting gay people who had never told a single person that they were gay…\" (O'Toole, ‘Interview’, p 97). Communication through spoken word is rare in the saunas too, and so the importance of silence is established because it manifests the sense of fear of the individuals in being discovered as homosexual in a largely homophobic society. Richard comes to realise, when discussing a gay bar with friends, that \"everyone [there] is frightened. They stare straight ahead as though someone is going to tell everyone their big secret\" (p 249).\n\nThe novel opens when the National Reorganization Process were in Power. The National Reorganization Process was a military dictatorship that controlled Argentina from 1976 to 1983. The Dirty War was also happening during this time, where the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (AAA) killed thousands of left-wing activists. It is estimated that 30,000 people disappeared. When Richard's friend from university says that his girlfriend disappeared during this time, he says that the AAA 'drugged their victims and hauled them into aircraft and threw them into the sea' – a reference to the Death flights that happened during this era.\n\nIn 1982 the Falklands War broke out after Argentina invaded the British-owned Falkland Islands. The National Reorganization Process hoped that by taking back the islands they could increase patriotism and support for their regime. Richard celebrates the invasion on p67 of the novel, and discusses the progress of the war with Senor Canetto in the following pages. Argentina lost the war, and Britain took back control of the islands.\n\nThe Generals who had held power during the military dictatorship were put on trial, and democracy was restored to Argentina. Alfonsín was elected President. In the novel we can see Senor Canetto's response to this change as he attempts to run for president. Susan and Donald's involvement in getting Menem elected is also a result of the Foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration after the war.\n\nIn order to understand the social context in which this novel takes place, from the late 1970s to the 1980s, it is important to look at the development of the LGBT rights in Argentina that were taking place alongside the political restructuring of the country. Prior to and during the earlier period of the 60s, political attitudes were vague and somewhat contradictory. Yet, like a lot of the western world, Argentina's LGBT movements gained momentum during the 1970s, with the establishment of the first LGBT organisation in 1967 called ‘Nuestro Mondo’.\n\nUnlike western groups, however, Nuestro Mondo and other LGBT groups did not seek political activism or change, but sought to bring awareness to the movement.

He's a master of using this apparent simplicity to convey powerful atmospheres that remain with the reader long after the experience of reading the novel is finished. Reading his work a second time is strongly recommended, as there are layers of nuance to be discovered and explored (Sette, Jorge).\n\nThe tone is cool and discreet; Tóibín's fondness for understatement when describing emotional turbulence is admirable and quite effective.\n\nThe genre is ambiguous as the novel can fit into a plethora of categories not limited to and including: a political novel, gay romance, historical fiction, a thriller, a mystery, etc.\n\nTóibín seems to be fascinated with the ways that suppressed feelings can shape and deform character, and the often destructive and always disruptive manner in which long repressed emotions can emerge (Kirkus Reviews).\n\n\"A brave and remarkable novel, the impact of which no reader will shed\" Dermot Bolger, Sunday Independent\n\n\"The Story of the Night is a love story of the most serious and difficult kind. Tóibín has told it with profound artistry and truth\" Tobias Wolff\n\n\"Nobody before Tóibín has made such honesty stand so clearly for political and personal integrity…In each of his first three novels he has invented a strong central character but Garay is by far his most memorable\" Edmund White, Sunday Times\n\n\"He writes sentences of classical elegance with staccato insistence… Tóibín is not a writer who lets reders go once he has them in his grasp. There is always, you feel, the potential for surprise, that silences will be exploded, that a revelation is coming\" Alan Taylor, Scotsman\n\nHowever, some reviewers have also argued that Tóibín's political views often overshadow the more personal themes in his works, citing \"Homage to Barcelona\" and \"The Story of the Night\" as examples (\"eNotes\").\n\nIt won the Ferro-Grumley Award for the \"Best Gay Novel of 1997\".\n\n"}

He co-wrote the book \"U potrazi za staklenim gradom\" (\"In pursuit of the glass city\").\n\nIn the period between 1970 and 1974 he studied philosophy and mass media in India and the Indian philosopher Swami Ashram Shama, which allowed him to gain more insight into Indian society. He ended studies as the best foreign student. He received diploma personally from Indian president V. V. Giri. In India, he worked for the producers Don Charnon, Canadian film ltd, Indian film division, and for the government of the state Rajasthan. In 1977 he led an expedition for Zagreb television entitled \"Journey to the East\", which had great success.\n\nIn 1982 he became the leader of professional expeditions, and worked for the Institute of Ecotechnics which has its headquarters in London. For the U.S. company Tropic Ventures he operated one of the largest expedition the world called \"Around the Tropic World\" (1982–1986). He is the author of the documentary series with the expedition entitled \"Journey to other worlds.\" Speleological participating in expeditions that achieved the world accepted the results in the scientific world (the discovery of the longest olm).\n\nMalnar authored over 100 documentary films and reports from Turkey, Jordan, Ethiopia, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Tibet, Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Panama, Ecuador, Samoa, the South Pacific, New Hebrides, Solomon Islands, etc. He received many awards throughout the world - Chicago International Film Festival, Barcelona Film Festival, etc. In 1986 he got the city keys to Fort Worth, Dallas in the U.S. state of Texas from mayor Bob Bolan as a reward for bringing cultures and peoples. He is the only holder of foreign titles SEIU (chiefs speaking) Polynesian states Samoa.\n\nIn 1992, Malnar started producing \"Nightmare Stage\", a show that hosted many picturesque characters from the streets of Zagreb (Cro Rom, Stankec, Tarzan, Jaran, Laki, Ševa etc.). Malnar proclaimed himself the president of the so-called Republic of Peščenica (Zagreb suburb) in the beginning of the 1990s, a satirical-parodical project, a parody on contemporary Croatian political scene.\n\nIn 2004, the City Council of Zagreb nominated Željko Malnar for the city award (\"plaketa\") for his work on \"Nightmare Stage\", for the show's \"authenticity, brave opposition to an artificial virtual world, false greatness and hypocrisy in the society\".\n\nIn 2005, Malnar's TV show included shots from a local pornographic movie, which caused the Croatian agency for electronic media regulation to censure his then-station OTV and force it off the air for a period of 24 hours.\n\nThe \"Nighmare Stage\" was later broadcast on the TV station Z1.\n\nŽeljko Malnar died at age 69 in Zagreb. He was cremated and his ashes will be scattered in the Adriatic Sea.\n\nMalnar has always been fascinated by Alexander III of Macedon (Alexander the Great) and his travels by horse. He decided to repeat Alexander's trip to Afghanistan by horse. As he later said, it was for him the highest and most difficult expedition that he did not finish. After two years of preparation on 30 May 1991. Malnar with his four friends, four horses and a jeep took off to the East. They began in Karlovac, Croatia and traveled through Macedonia and Bulgaria to Turkey. In Turkey, Malnar found out that the war broke out in Croatia so he decided to travel under Croatian flag instead of Yugoslav, resulting in cancellation of sponsorship which lead to financial problems. At the entrance to Syria Bassel al-Assad heard about their expedition and provided all the supplies, because he felt they were conducting a worldwide venture. In Lebanon, Malnar was a guest of Sheik Abbas al-Musawi, who died ten days later in an Israeli attack. They were also received by Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah. The journey was interrupted in 1993 in Jordan, near the border with Saudi Arabia, due to a personal loss in Malnar's family.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was among the 20 men to sign the Act of Independence of Lithuania on February 16, 1918.\n\nBorn in the Anykščiai district, then in Imperial Russia, Kairys graduated from the Institute of Technology in Saint Petersburg. Due to conflicts with the academic administration concerning his participation in student clubs and dissident demonstrations, his studies were intermittently interrupted. Following graduation he worked for several years in railroad construction in the Samara and Kursk regions of Russia. He returned to Lithuania in 1912 and worked on city sanitation and water supply systems in Vilnius, and following the Polish occupation of the city left to the temporary capital of Lithuania, Kaunas. After 1923, he taught at the University of Lithuania in Kaunas, where in 1940, he received an honorary doctorate in engineering.\n\nKairys joined the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party in 1900. The party had already separated itself from the Russian Social Democrats and sought independence for Lithuania. Kairys was elected to the Central Committee of the party next year and remained in the leadership roles until the party ceased its activities in 1944. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, he participated in the Great Seimas of Vilnius as a member of presidium. The Great Seimas clearly expressed Lithuania's intentions to become an independent state, or at least to gain considerable autonomy from the Russian Empire. In 1907, Kairys helped to the 5 Lithuanian social democrats elected to the second Duma write speeches and letters. Before World War I, Kairys worked to promote his party and social democracy.\n\nAfter the German occupation during the war, Kairys became actively involved with people seeking independence for Lithuania. In 1917 he attended Vilnius Conference where he got elected to the 20-member Council of Lithuania. The council was formed by the conference to declare and establish independence of Lithuania. The task, however, was extremely tough because of the German Wehrmacht presence in the state. The Germans promised to recognize the state if the council agreed to form a firm and permanent federation with Germany. The council issued a declaration to that effect on December 11, 1917. However, Germany did not keep its word and did not recognize the state. The council was torn apart and Kairys with three others withdrew on January 26, 1918. However, on February 16, 1918 they returned to sign the Act of Independence of Lithuania. The act did not mention anything in specific about relations to Germany.\n\nThe council proceeded to negotiate with Germany, which now demanded to void the February 16 decision and recognized the state based on the December 11 declaration. On July 13, 1918, the council, in hopes to avoid being incorporated into a personal union with the Hohenzollern dynasty, elected Mindaugas II as King of Lithuania. This was unacceptable for Kairys and he left the council, this time permanently. However, he remained active in the politics: he was elected to the Constituent Assembly and all three Seimas before the coup d'état of 1926. The authoritarian regime of Antanas Smetona placed Kairys in an opposition.\n\nAfter the 1940 Soviet invasion of Lithuania, the Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania ( or \"VLIK\") was formed and Kairys became its chairman. The organization united people of different political views. In April 1944 majority of the members were arrested by the Gestapo. Kairys changed his name to Juozas Kaminskas and tried to escape to Sweden. Before moving to the United States in 1952, he lived in Germany, where VLIK was revived. Kairys attempted to gain political support for a democratic socialist opposition among other exiles and expatriates. For the last decade of his life, he battled illness and could not fully participate in various political organizations. Two volumes of his memoirs were published. He died in 1964 in New York. Kairys was reinterred in Petrašiūnai Cemetery of Kaunas.\n\n\n"}

The occasional main card member of the roster will compete as well. This is done to further enhance the experience to be gained for the trainees and teach the outsiders how to compete in the Dragon System of wrestling.\n\nThe vast majority of NEX shows are called \"Sanctuary\" and are held twice a month. They generally draw an attendance of around 90 fans due to the limited size and space of the venue. There are also special event shows called \"Premium,\" which are the equivalent in atmosphere to a pay-per-view.

{"id": "2267488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267488", "title": "Mule (smuggling)", "text": "Mule (smuggling)\n\nA mule or courier is someone who personally smuggles contraband across a border (as opposed to sending by mail, etc.) for a smuggling organization. The organizers employ mules to reduce the risk of getting caught themselves. Methods of smuggling include hiding the goods in vehicles or carried items, attaching them to one's body, or using the body as a container.\n\nIn the case of transporting illegal drugs, the term drug mule applies. Other slang terms include Kinder Surprise and Easter Egg. Small-scale operations, in which one courier carries one piece or a very small quantity, are sometimes called the ant trade.\n\nMethods of smuggling include hiding the goods in a vehicle, luggage, or clothes. In a vehicle, the contraband is hidden in secret compartments.\n\nSometimes the goods are hidden in the bag or vehicle of an innocent person, who does not know about the contraband, for the purpose of retrieving the goods elsewhere.\n\nSome contraband is legal to possess but is subject to taxes or other import restrictions, such as second-hand clothes and computers, and the purpose of the smuggling is to get around these restrictions. In this case, smuggling may be done in plain sight, in smaller quantities, so that a suitcase full of used clothes or a new computer can be passed off as a personal possession rather than an importing business.\n\nThe practice of transporting goods outside or inside of the body is called body packing. This is done by a person usually called a mule or bait. The contraband is attached to the outside of the body using adhesive tape, glue, or straps, often in such places as between the cheeks of the buttocks or between rolls of fat. Other inconspicuous places, like the soles of cut out shoes, inside belts, or the rim of a hat, were used more often prior to the early 1990s. Due to increased airport security the \"body packing\" method is rarely used any more.\nSome narcotics-trafficking organizations, such as the Mexican cartels, will purposely send one or two people with drugs on the outside of their body to purposely be caught, so that the authorities are preoccupied while dozens of mules pass by undetected with drugs inside their body. However, even these diversionary tactics are becoming less prevalent as airport security increases.\n\nThis is often done using a mule's gastrointestinal tract or other body cavities as containers. Swallowing has been used for the transportation of heroin, cocaine, and MDMA/Ecstasy. A swallower typically fills tiny balloons with small quantities of a drug. The balloons may be made with multilayered condoms, fingers of latex gloves, or more sophisticated hollow pellets. One smuggling method involves swallowing the balloons, which are recovered later from the excreted feces. Alternately, the balloons may be hidden in other natural or artificial body cavities – such as rectum, colostomy, vagina, and mouth – although this method is far more vulnerable to body cavity searches. A drug mule may swallow dozens upon dozens of balloons. The swallower then attempts to cross international borders, excrete the balloons, and sell the drugs.\n\nIt is most common for the swallower to be making the trip on behalf of a drug lord or drug dealer. Swallowers are often impoverished and agree to transport the drugs in exchange for money or other favors. In fewer cases, the drug dealers can attempt extortion against people by threatening physical harm against friends or family, but the more common practice is for swallowers to willingly accept the job in exchange for big payoffs. As reported in \"Lost Rights\" by James Bovard: \"Nigerian drug lords have employed an army of 'swallowers', those who will swallow as many as 150 balloons and smuggle drugs into the United States. Given the per capita yearly income of Nigeria is $2,100, Nigerians can collect as much as $15,000 per trip.\" Swallowers have been apprehended from a variety of age groups, including adults, teens, and children.\n\nRoutine detection of the smuggled packets is extremely difficult, and many cases come to light because a packet has ruptured or because of intestinal obstruction. Unruptured packets may sometimes be detected by rectal or vaginal examination, but the only reliable way is by X-ray of the abdomen. Hashish appears denser than stool, cocaine is approximately the same density as stool, while heroin looks like air.\n\nAn increasingly popular type of swallowing involves having the drug in the form of liquid-filled balloons or condoms/packages. These are impossible to detect unless the airport has high-sensitivity X-Ray equipment, as a liquid mixture of water and the drug will most likely not be detected using a standard X-Ray machine. Most of the major airports in Europe, Canada, and the US have the more sensitive machines.\n\nIn most cases, it is only necessary to wait for the packets to pass normally, but if a packet ruptures or if there is intestinal obstruction, then it may be necessary to operate and surgically remove the packets. Oil-based laxatives should never be used, as they can weaken the latex of condoms and cause packets to rupture. Emetics like syrup of ipecac, enemas, and endoscopic retrieval all carry a risk of packet rupture and should not be used. Repeat imaging is only necessary if the mule does not know the packet count.\n\nRuptured packets can be fatal and often require treatment as for a drug overdose and may require admission to an intensive care unit. Body packers are not always reliable sources of information about the contents of the packages (either because of fears about information being passed on to law enforcement agencies or because the mule genuinely does not know). Urine toxicology may be necessary to determine what drugs are being carried and what antidotes are needed.\n\nElectronic products such as iPhones sell cheaper in Hong Kong, one of China's Special Administrative Regions where the tax laws are relaxed. Smugglers buy them in Hong Kong and employ mules that strap iPhones around their waists and ankles, and smuggle them across the border from Hong Kong to Shenzhen. According to Customs Law of China and Smuggling Penalties, a person shall be subject to a criminal charge if found smuggling small quantities of goods three times in one year. The maximum jail sentence is three years.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court dealt with body packing in \"United States v. Montoya De Hernandez\". In \"Hernandez\", a woman attempted to smuggle 88 balloons of cocaine in her gastrointestinal tract. She had been detained for over 16 hours by customs inspectors before she finally passed some of the balloons. She was being held because her abdomen was noticeably swollen (she claimed to be pregnant), and a search of her body had revealed that she was wearing two pairs of elastic underpants and had lined her crotch area with paper towels. This is done because balloon swallowing makes bowel movements difficult to control. The woman claimed her Fourth Amendment rights had been violated, but the court found in favor of the border authorities.\n\nWith regard to traffic from South America to the US, the US Drug Enforcement Administration reports: \"Unlike cocaine, heroin is often smuggled by people who swallow large numbers of small capsules (50–90), allowing them to transport up to 1.5 kilograms of heroin.\n\nIn 2003, over 50% of foreign females in UK jails were drug mules from Jamaica. Nigerian women make a large contribution to the remaining figure.\n\nIn all, around 18% of the UK's female jail population are foreigners, 60% of whom are serving sentences for drug-related offences – most of them drug mules.\n\n"}

{"id": "2267531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267531", "title": "International Boundary and Water Commission", "text": "International Boundary and Water Commission\n\nThe International Boundary and Water Commission () is an international body created by the United States and Mexico in 1889 to apply the rules for determining the location of their international boundary when meandering rivers transferred tracts of land from one bank to the other, as established under the Convention of November 12, 1884. \n\nThe organization was created as the International Boundary Commission by the Convention of 1889 between the United States and Mexico. It was given its present name under the 1944 \"Treaty relating to the Utilization of Waters of the Colorado and Tijuana Rivers and of the Rio Grande\". Under these agreements, the IBWC has a U.S. section and a Mexican section, headquartered in the adjoining cities of El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua. The U.S. section is administered by the Department of State, and the Mexican part by the Secretariat of Foreign Relations.\n\nSome of the rights and obligations administered by the IBWC include: \n\nThe U.S. and Mexican commissioners meet at least weekly, alternating the place of meetings, and are in almost daily contact with one another. Each section maintains its own engineering staff, a secretary, and such legal advisers and other assistants as it deems necessary.\n\nThe Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 2 February 1848 fixed the international boundary between El Paso – Ciudad Juárez and the Gulf of Mexico. The Gadsden Purchase Treaty of 30 December 1853 extended the southern boundary of New Mexico and Arizona southwards to enable the United States to construct a railroad to the west coast along a southern route and to resolve a question arising from the 1848 Treaty as to the location of the southern boundary of New Mexico. Temporary commissions were formed by these boundary treaties to perform the first joint mission of the governments of the United States and Mexico, which was to survey and demarcate the boundary on the ground in accordance with the treaties. Another temporary commission was created by the 1852 Boundary Convention (29 July), which surveyed and increased the number of monuments marking the land boundary westward from El Paso and Ciudad Juárez. As settlements sprang up along the boundary rivers and the adjoining lands began to be developed for agriculture in the late 19th century, questions arose as to the location of the boundary when the rivers changed their course and transferred tracts of land from one side of the river to the other. The two governments, under the 1884 Border Convention (12 November), adopted certain rules designed to deal with such questions.\n\nBy the 1889 Border Convention (1 March), the two governments created the International Boundary Commission (IBC), to consist of a United States section and a Mexican section. The IBC was charged with the application of the rules of the 1884 Convention, for the settlement of questions arising as to the location of the boundary when the rivers changed their course. That convention was modified by the Banco Convention of 20 March 1905 to retain the Rio Grande and the Colorado River as the boundary.\n\nThe 1906 Boundary Waters Convention (21 May) provided for the distribution between the United States and Mexico of the waters of the Rio Grande above Fort Quitman, Texas, for the 143-km (89-mile) international boundary reach of the Rio Grande through the El Paso–Juárez Valley. This convention allotted to Mexico annually of the waters of the Rio Grande to be delivered in accordance with a monthly schedule at the headgate to Mexico's Acequia Madre just above Ciudad Juárez. To facilitate such deliveries, the United States constructed, at its expense, the Elephant Butte Dike in its territory. The convention includes the proviso that in case of extraordinary drought or serious accident to the irrigation system in the United States, the amount of water delivered to the Mexican canal shall be diminished in the same proportion as the water delivered to lands under the irrigation system in the United States downstream of Elephant Butte Dike.\nIn the 1933 Border Convention (1 February), the two governments agreed to jointly construct, operate, and maintain, through the IBC, the Rio Grande Rectification Project, which straightened and stabilized the 249-km (155-mile) river boundary through the highly developed El Paso–Juárez Valley. The project further provided for the control of the river's floods through this valley. Numerous parcels of land (174) were transferred between the two countries during the construction period, 1935 – 1938. At the end, each nation had ceded an equal area of land () to the other.\n\nThe Treaty relating to the utilization of waters of the Colorado and Tijuana Rivers and of the Rio Grande of 3 February 1944 distributed between the two countries the waters of the Rio Grande from Fort Quitman to the Gulf of Mexico, and the waters of the Colorado River. Of the waters of the Rio Grande, the treaty allocates to Mexico: \n\nThe treaty allocates to the United States: \n\nThe 1944 treaty further provided for the two governments to jointly construct, operate, and maintain on the main channel of the Rio Grande the dams required for the conservation, storage, and regulation of the greatest quantity of the annual flow of the river to enable each country to make optimum use of its allotted waters. The treaty also provides that of the waters of the Colorado River, Mexico is to receive: \n\nTo enable diversion of Mexico's allotted waters, the treaty provided for the construction by Mexico of a main diversion structure in the Colorado River, below the point where the California–Baja California land boundary line intersects the river. It also provided for the construction at Mexico's expense of such works as may be needed in the United States to protect its lands from such floods and seepage as might result from the construction and operation of the diversion structure.\n\nIn the 1944 treaty, the two governments agreed to give preferential attention to the solution of all border sanitation problems. This treaty entrusts the IBWC (the renamed International Boundary Commission of the 1889 Convention) with the application of its terms, the regulation and exercise of the rights and obligations which the two governments assumed thereunder, and the settlement of all disputes to which its observance and execution may give rise. The treaty also provides that the IBWC study, investigate, and report to the governments on such hydroelectric facilities as the IBWC finds should be built at the international storage dams and on such flood control works, other than those specified in the treaty, that the IBWC finds should be built on the boundary rivers, the estimated cost thereof, the part to be built by each government, and to be operated and maintained by each through its section of the IBWC.\n\nUnder the terms of the 1944 treaty, the two governments reached agreement for the solution of the international problem of the salinity of the Lower Colorado River (30 August 1973), and the IBWC submitted and the two governments approved \"Recommendations for the Solution of the Border Sanitation Problems\" (24 September 1979).\n\nThe Chamizal Convention of 29 August 1963 resolved the nearly 100-year-old boundary problem at El Paso and Ciudad Juárez. Known as the Chamizal Dispute, this involved some of territory that were transferred from the south to the north bank of the Rio Grande by movement of the river during the latter part of the 19th century. By this convention, the two governments gave effect to a 1911 arbitration award under 1963 conditions. The convention provided for the relocation by the IBWC of the 7 km (4.4 miles) of the channel of the Rio Grande so as to transfer a net amount of 176.92 ha (437.18 acres) from the north to the south side of the river. U.S. President Lyndon Johnson met Mexican President Adolfo López Mateos in El Paso on 24 September 1964 to commemorate the ratification of the Chamizal Convention.\n\nThe 1970 Boundary Treaty (23 November) resolved all pending boundary differences and provided for maintaining the Rio Grande and the Colorado River as the international boundary. The Rio Grande was re-established as the boundary throughout its 2,019-km (1,254 mile) limitrophe section. The treaty includes provisions for restoring and preserving the character of the Rio Grande as the international boundary where that character has been lost, to minimize changes in the channel, and to resolve problems of sovereignty that might arise due to future changes in the channel of the Rio Grande. It provides for procedures designed to avoid the loss of territory by either country incident to future changes in the river's course due to causes other than lateral movement, incident to eroding one of its banks and depositing alluvium on the opposite bank. This treaty, too, charged the IBWC with carrying out its provisions.\n\nThe Boundary Treaty of 1970 transferred of Mexican territory to the U.S., in areas near Presidio and Hidalgo, Texas, to build flood-control channels. In exchange, the U.S. ceded to Mexico, including five parcels near Presidio, the Horcon Tract containing the little town of Rio Rico, Texas, and Beaver Island near Roma, Texas. The last of these transfers occurred in 1977.\n\nOn November 24, 2009, the U.S. ceded six islands in the Rio Grande to Mexico, totaling . At the same time, Mexico ceded three islands and two cuts to the U.S., totaling . This transfer, which had been pending for 20 years, was the first application of Article III of the \"1970 Boundary Treaty\". In recent years, the IBWC has been criticized as an institutional anachronism, bypassed by modern social, environmental, and political issues. The U.S. section has been described as secretive, beholden to special interests, and indifferent to environmental problems. The State Department has attempted to distance itself from responsibility for the U.S. section, even disclaiming jurisdiction, notwithstanding numerous statutes to the contrary. Critics, including the agency's employees, say poor leadership has led to deteriorating levees, dams, and water-treatment facilities.\n\nThe IBWC addresses boundary and water issues. International delegations meet with the IBWC. The IBWC commissioners speak at national and international water conferences.\n\n\n\n"}

Then an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, Dietz testified that at the time of the shooting, Hinckley knew what he was doing, knew it was wrong, and had the capacity to control his behavior thus was not legally insane.\n\nDietz is also a criminologist, and in 1987 he created the specialty of workplace violence prevention in founding Threat Assessment Group, Inc. (TAG), which specializes in analyzing and managing threatening behavior and communications, stalking, risks arising from domestic violence, and other abnormal activity in corporations, colleges, and schools. As of 2013, more than 20,000 senior corporate managers have attended TAG training seminars.\n\nA separate company, Park Dietz & Associates (PD&A), is a forensic consulting firm specializing in criminal behavior analysis, forensic psychiatry, forensic psychology and other forensic sciences, serving prosecutors, criminal defense attorneys, and attorneys representing defendants and plaintiffs in civil litigation. PD&A's national roster of experts includes physicians, psychologists, and retired FBI agents with wide expertise on the forensic aspects of fields as diverse as neurology, social work and pathology. Both TAG and PD&A are headquartered in Southern California with PD&A having a second office in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn addition to his work as a forensic psychologist, Dietz has consulted for television shows including \"Law & Order\" and \"\".\n\nDietz was born on August 13, 1948 and raised in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Harrisburg. His mother, Marjorie Dietz, who had trained as a nurse and did hospital volunteer work including activities at a local mental institution. His father, Raymond Dietz, was a physician, as was Dietz's grandfather.\n\nDietz graduated from Camp Hill High School in 1966 and that same year enrolled at Cornell University to major in Psychology and Biology. He was a member of Cornell's Theta Delta Chi fraternity. In 1970 he graduated with an A.B. cum laude in Psychology, and was a Phi Beta Kappa.\n\nIn 1970, Dietz received a senatorial scholarship to study at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, transferring in 1972 to Johns Hopkins University. There, he was among a handful of students in the M.D.-Ph.D. Program in Behavioral Sciences funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences and the Grant Foundation of New York. From 1972-1975, while completing medical school and course requirements for a Ph.D. in Social Relations, Dietz also earned a Master of Public Health (MPH) degree.\n\nDietz worked with the school's noted public health professor Susan Baker on a study of drowning cases and their prevention and epidemiology, using the Haddon Matrix paradigm to categorize specific prevention measures for specific injuries. In 2012, Baker wrote that Dietz, \"later applied the Matrix to the problem of rape, showing its value in formulating approaches to intentional injury…and the Haddon Matrix probably played a role in his development of an entire industry addressed to workplace violence prevention.\"\n\nAfter completing his residency in psychiatry at Johns Hopkins in 1978, Dietz began teaching at Harvard Medical School, where at age 29 he was the school's youngest assistant professor. While teaching at Harvard, Dietz also was the director of forensic psychiatry at Bridgewater State Hospital, a facility for the criminally insane in Bridgewater, Massachusetts.\n\nAfter four years at Harvard, Dietz became an associate professor at the University of Virginia in 1982, teaching law, behavioral medicine and psychiatry at the UVA School of Law while also being the medical director at UVA's Institute of Law, Psychiatry and Public Policy. He taught on the Charlottesville campus for six years, and was promoted to Professor of Law in the School of Law and Professor of Behavioral Medicine and Psychiatry in the School of Medicine.\n\nJohn W. Hinckley, Jr. attempted to assassinate President Reagan outside Washington, D.C.'s Hilton Hotel on March 30, 1981, and Hinckley's 1982 trial included Dietz as an expert prosecution witness (while he still was teaching at Harvard). In his five days of testimony, Dietz told the jury that Hinckley told him that he felt shooting the president accomplished his goal of trying to impress actress Jodie Foster. Dietz quoted Hinckley as saying, \" 'Actually, I should feel good because I accomplished everything on a grand scale… I did it for her (Foster's) sake…' \"\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Roger Adelman, the chief prosecutor, argued that Hinckley may have been emotionally unstable at the time of the shooting, but that he was not so mentally disturbed that he could not understand what he did when he shot Reagan. Dietz and the colleagues whom he led wrote the prosecution's 628-page report on Hinckley's mental state.\n\nDietz diagnosed Hinckley with personality disorders: narcissistic, schizoid, and a mixed personality disorder with passive-aggressive and borderline traits, plus persistent sadness. Hinckley had, according to the Dietz-authored report, \"a pattern of unstable relationships; an identity disturbance… chronic feelings of emptiness and boredom…inability to sustain consistent work behavior…lack of self-confidence.\" But Dietz also told the jury that none of these personality issues free Hinckley from legal responsibility for shooting Reagan. \"On March 30, 1981, Mr. Hinckley, as a result of mental disease or defect, did not lack substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct.\"\n\nDietz used Hinckley's assessment of the assassination location, as Reagan walked outside the Hilton Hotel, as an example of how Hinckley did, \"appreciate the wrongfulness,\" of his actions, but nonetheless went forward. Dietz said Hinckley had a, \"long-standing interest in fame and assassination,\" and that he had studied, \"the publicity associated with various crimes.\"\n\nHinckley's mental health state was clear enough that he knew the type of bullet that would do the most damage, Dietz told the jury, plus the step-by-step movements needed to get close to Reagan on March 30. \"He was able to make other decisions on that date,\" Dietz said. \"He decided where to go for breakfast, what to eat…He made personal decisions of that sort….He deliberated and made a decision to survey the scene at the Hilton Hotel. There was no voice commanding him to do that…He decided, as he tells us, to go to the Hilton to check out the scene to see how close he could get.\" He also explained that Hinckley summarized, \"…the situation as having poor security…He saw that the range was close and within the distance with which he was accurate, and at the precise moment that he chose to draw his revolver there was a diversion of attention from him…The Secret Service and others in the presidential entourage looked the other way just as he was pulling the gun…Finally, his decision to fire, thinking that others had seen him…indicates his awareness that others seeing him was significant because others recognized that what he was doing and about to do were wrong.\"\n\nHinckley's defense team argued that he was schizophrenic and thus not criminally responsible for his actions. After eight weeks of testimony, the jury on June 21, 1982 found Hinckley not guilty on all 13 counts by reason of insanity, a verdict that so shocked the nation that Senator Arlen Specter held a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee to question the jurors and both the American Psychiatric Association and American Bar Association appointed task forces to work on a revised test of insanity to clarify federal law.\n\nThe trial catapulted Dietz into the national spotlight: attorneys took special note of his unique knowledge of deviant behavior, with the FBI also seeking his expertise. His concurrent teaching at the University of Virginia from 1982 to 1988 ended with Dietz moving to Southern California to start his forensic consulting firm.\n\nSerial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered 17 boys and men from 1978 to 1991, all but one of them in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Dietz was hired by the prosecution to evaluate Dahmer's claim that he was \"guilty but insane.\" Dietz interviewed him for 18 hours, with the psychiatrist describing Dahmer as, \"articulate, rational and motivated to speak the truth.\" During his two days of testimony, Dietz explained to the jury that Dahmer was not insane or driven to commit murder but, instead, had sexual disorders and exhibited sexually deviant behavior with his victims, but purposely drank himself to the point of intoxication when he killed. Dahmer, he said, also kept the skulls of 11 of his victims: far from being insane, Dietz said Dahmer, calmly and rationally, knew that keeping, \"some of his favorite items, these keepsakes, [meant taking] a very big risk of being detected for all these serious crimes.\"\n\nDietz was impressed at how Dahmer remembered intricate details of each murder. The two men watched some of Dahmer's cinematic favorites including \"\", \"The Exorcist III\", plus gay pornography.\n\nDahmer also gave Dietz plans for a temple he wanted to build for most of the 11 victims' skulls that he kept, with plans to paint them. \"Mr. Dahmer drew for me a diagram of what he had in mind—planned for the temple,\" Dietz told the jury. \"And that diagram of the temple shows 10 skulls on a table, with incense burning on both ends, and two whole skeletons on either end of the black table…and a special globe lamp to impart an eerie sense of lighting. And he wanted a black leather chair so that he could sit in the leather chair and admire his collection. If he did this, and had it set up this way, he…could somehow get in touch with some spiritual force or power.\"\n\nBoth the \"Star Wars\" and \"Exorcist\" films had evil characters that inspired the temple, specifically the emperor in \"Return of the Jedi\" and the devil in \"The Exorcist III\". \"He identified with the characters,\" Dietz told the jury, \"because he felt that he was thoroughly evil and corrupt.\"\n\nAt the conclusion of his 1992 trial, Dahmer was convicted of the 15 Wisconsin murders to which he had confessed, and received 15 life sentences.\n\nThe \"Unabomber\" terrorist Ted Kaczynski injured 23 people and killed three more using homemade bombs from 1978 to 1995. Kaczynski pleaded guilty to all federal charges including murder just after his 1998 trial began: though Dietz was unable to interview him before that for federal prosecutors, the psychiatrist did read his journals, interviewed those who knew him, and reviewed all of the evidence gathered by investigators. Kaczynski's writings, he said in an interview with \"The New Yorker\" magazine, \"scream geek, not schizophrenic,\" contrary to the defense team's psychiatric evaluation of Kaczynski as a paranoid schizophrenic. \"They're full of strong emotions, considerable anger, and an elaborate, closely reasoned system of belief about the adverse impact of technology on society,\" Dietz said. \"The question always is: Is that belief system philosophy or is it delusion? The answer has more to do with the ideology of the psychiatrist than with anything else.\"\n\nDietz attracted considerable controversy following his testimony in the 2002 trial of Andrea Yates, a woman convicted of drowning her five children in a bathtub. Dietz was the prosecution's lone mental health expert, and testified that shortly before Yates committed the crime, the television crime drama franchise \"Law & Order\" had aired an episode about a woman who drowned her children and was found innocent by reason of insanity. No such \"Law & Order\" episode existed, and when the error became known, Yates' murder conviction was overturned by an appeals court. The negative publicity following the Yates trial led Dietz to be dropped as an expert from Marcus Wesson's murder trial.\n\nDietz was one of 12 people appointed in 1985 to President Reagan's Attorney General's Commission on Pornography, better known as The Meese Commission after then-U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese. The commission's final, 1,960-page, five-part, 35-chapter, report was published in July 1986. At the University of Virginia law school library's special collection department, the inventory of Dietz's papers includes 16 boxes dedicated solely to his work on the commission, covering a broad range of sexuality issues from nude sunbathing to bondage publications and \"Playboy\" magazine cartoons plus one box bearing a title with the now-antiquated phrase, \"Dial-a-Porn.\"\n\nIn his personal statement in the commission's report, Dietz contrasted his commission work with his many years of studying the psychopathic behavior of killers, writing that when he joined the commission, \"…the morality of pornography was the farthest thing from my mind... Thus, I was astonished to find that by the final meeting of the Commission, pornography had become a matter of moral concern to me. While other Commissioners may have learned things about the dark side of life that they had never known, I remembered something about the higher purposes of life and of humanity's aspirations that I had forgotten during too many years working on the dark side.\"\n\nDietz also stated in the final report, \"In my opinion, we know enough now to be confident in asserting that a population exposed to violent pornography is a population that commits more acts of sexual brutality than it otherwise would and to suggest somewhat less confidently that the same is probably true of a population exposed to degrading pornography.\"\n\nDietz's extensive commission statement outlined eight areas in which pornography creates, or helps foster, \"a medical and public health problem.\" Surveying these issues, Dietz wrote, in part:\n\n\nDietz also wrote that pornography is, \"both causal and symptomatic of immorality and corruption. A world in which pornography were neither desired nor produced would be a better world, but it is not within the power of government or even of a majority of citizens to create such a world…a great deal of contemporary pornography constitutes an offense against human dignity and decency that should be shunned by the citizens, not because the evils of the world will thereby be eliminated, but because conscience demands it.\"\n\n"}

A two-time world champion, Vise went on to compete for the University of Oklahoma.\n\nBorn in Dallas, Texas, Vise is not the only athlete in her family. Her brothers are active in many different sports and Vise's mother was also a gymnast when she was younger. Her grandfather, the character actor Burton Gilliam, was a Golden Gloves boxer who won more than 200 bouts before turning to acting.\n\nVise started gymnastics at age three and advanced so quickly that she could not compete in Level 5 of USA Gymnastics' Junior Olympic program because she did not meet the age requirement of six. She began training at World Olympic Gymnastics Academy (WOGA) in Plano, Texas, along with teammates Katie Dailey and Mellissa Smith, when she reached Level 8 at seven years old. At the age of 11, she passed over Level 10 and became an elite gymnast.\n\nVise was known for her long body lines, graceful style, and extreme flexibility. One of her signature skills on beam was her mount, where she jumped to a cheststand and then arched her legs over. She also performed a needle scale. These two poses were very photogenic and contributed to Vise's fame as a gymnast.\n\nThroughout her elite career, she was trained by former Russian acrobat Evgeny Marchenko. Her teammates at WOGA included 2004 Olympic all-around champion Carly Patterson and 2008 Olympic all-around champion Nastia Liukin.\n\nVise is best remembered for her gold medals at the 2003 World Championships in the team and uneven bars events.\n\nVise competed on uneven bars and balance beam in the team competition. Immediately prior to her routine, it was discovered that her number was not attached to the back of her leotard, a violation that automatically incurs a 0.2 deduction. Coaches quickly scribbled her number on a spare sheet of paper, safety-pinned it to her back, and sent her out. This was controversial, however, because she had already been signaled to start her routine when her coaches realized her number was missing, and she spent more than the allowed time for starting her routine (30 seconds) putting her number back on. Once she began her routine, Vise mistimed her Ono pirouette (a 360-degree turn on one arm) and fell on the piked Jaeger release that came immediately after. She scored an 8.875, much lower than the two athletes who went before her on the apparatus, who had scored in the 9.6 range. Nevertheless, she regrouped to put out a respectable performance on balance beam (9.512) that helped the U.S. team to its first team world gold. In the event finals, Vise scored 9.612 to tie Chellsie Memmel for the title. She and Memmel were the only members of the American team to take home individual gold medals from the World Championships, along with the team gold.\n\nA back injury caused Vise to withdraw from the 2004 U.S. National Championships. She competed on uneven bars and balance beam at the 2004 Olympic Trials, though several moves demonstrating her extreme flexibility had to be removed. She finished third and fifth, respectively. A fall on balance beam during the Olympic Selection Camp may have contributed to her failure to make the Olympic team. The team needed vault specialists, and Vise was a bar and beam specialist.\n\nVise earned a full scholarship to University of Oklahoma and competed for the Sooners starting in the 2006–07 season. At her first collegiate meet at Arizona State University, she scored 9.800 on beam. A week later, she scored 9.825 on beam at Iowa State University, tying for fourth place.\n\nVise showed consistency on beam in the 2011 season, scoring a 9.725 against Texas Woman's University when she added a front handspring before her dismount adding more difficulty. She scored a career-best 9.85 to tie for fourth on beam against Pittsburgh. She recorded the Sooners' second-best beam score (9.825) at the Big 12 Championship and helped her team finish in second place.\n\nOn May 2, 2015, Vise married Alex Naddour, a member of the U.S. men's national gymnastics team. She gave birth to a daughter, Lilah, in February 2016 and a son, Crew, in June 2018.\n\n"}

{"id": "2267608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267608", "title": "Friedrich Halm", "text": "Friedrich Halm\n\nBaron Eligius Franz Joseph von Münch-Bellinghausen () (2 April 180622 May 1871) was an Austrian dramatist, poet and novella writer of the Austrian Biedermeier period and beyond, and is more generally known under his pseudonym Friedrich Halm.\n\nHe was the son of a district judge at Kraków in Poland, at this time part of the Austrian Empire. Early in his literary career he adopted the \"nom de plume\" of Friedrich Halm (\"Halm\" means a blade of grass or a blade of straw), and became one of the most popular dramatists in Vienna around the middle of the 19th century. His novellas are now regarded as more significant from a literary point of view than his dramatic writings.\n\nMünch-Bellinghausen was educated at the seminary of Melk Abbey and later at Vienna, where he studied philosophy and jurisprudence, and where he began his career in 1826.\n\nAs a boy he took a keen interest in the theater, and from 1833 enjoyed the friendship of his former teacher, the Benedictine Michael Leopold Enk von der Burg, who encouraged the poet to offer his drama \"Griseldis\" to the Hofburg theatre. \nIts successful production in 1835 established Halm's reputation as a playwright and henceforth he continued to write for the stage with varying success.\n\nMünch-Bellinghausen became Regierungsrat (government councillor) in 1840 and (chief keeper) of the Court Library in 1844, a position that Franz Grillparzer had sought in vain. He was elected member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in 1852, and life member of the Austrian Herrenhaus in 1861. In 1867, he was appointed superintendent of the two court-theatres, but three years later resigned this position which disputes had made distasteful to him. His health also had been failing.\n\nFriedrich Halm's earliest full-length drama, \"Schwert, Hammer, Buch\", completed in 1833 but never published, explores three various routes in quest of happiness: that of the warrior, that of the artisan, and that of the artist. \nThis massive drama of several hundred pages, although still a piece of 'juvenilia', has numerous effective passages and anticipates the literary talent that was to burst upon the Viennese literary scene just three or four years later with the publication of Halm's tragedy, \"Griseldis\". \nOf his many dramatic works the best known are, indeed, \"Griseldis\" (1837); \"Der Adept\" (1836; publ. 1838), \"Camoens\" (1838), \"Der Sohn der Wildnis\" (1842), and \"Der Fechter von Ravenna\" (1857). \n\"Griseldis\" is based on the well-known story of the faithful wife whose loyalty and devotion are put to the severest tests but who triumphs in the end. \"Der Sohn der Wildnis\" (\"The Son of the Wilderness\") is a romantic drama depicting the power of womanly love and virtue over rude barbarian strength. \nIt was presented on the English stage under the title of \"Ingomar the Barbarian\". \"Der Fechter von Ravenna\" (\"The Gladiator of Ravenna\"), regarded as one of Halm's best dramas, is a tragedy having for its hero Thumelicus the son of Arminius, the liberator of Germany from Roman rule. According to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" Eleventh Edition, \"[his plays] are distinguished by elegance of language, melodious versification and clever construction, and were for a time exceedingly popular.\"\n\nTheatrically these plays are very effective, but the characters are improbable and the situations are often strained. Their popularity, which they owe largely to their smooth, polished and beautiful diction and skillfully interspersed lyrics, has not been lasting. Of Halm's numerous other dramas we may mention the vivid and powerful \"Sampiero\" (1856, depicting the tragic loss of humanity attendant upon political fanaticism); \"Iphigenie in Delphi\" (1856); \"Begum Somru\" (1863); \"Wildfeuer\" (1864); a German version of Shakespeare's \"Cymbeline\" that appeared on the stage in 1842, and an extremely effective and humorous comedy entitled \"Verbot und Befehl\" (\"Prohibition and Decree\", 1856).\n\nHe is also the author of lyrics, short stories, and of a narrative poem \"Charfreitag\" (\"Good Friday\") (1864). His poems, \"Gedichte\", were published in Stuttgart, 1850 (new ed. Vienna. 1877). His pessimistic seems to have been formed very early on in life and never to have deserted him, as evidenced by early poems such as \"Eine Makame\" and later poems, \"Schwere Jahre\". These describe how life is seen as essentially a vale of tears and filled with suffering, and only made bearable by the hope of a blissful and tranquil life of the spirit. These will supervene after physical death.\n\nHalm's high reputation during his lifetime is indicated by the stone bust which was carved of him and which still sits on top of the famous Burgtheater in Vienna, alongside those of Schiller, Goethe and Grillparzer.\n\nFrom an early age, Halm showed an aptitude for fictional narrative, perhaps first exemplified in the charming tale, \"Die Abendgenossen\", written when Halm was in his early twenties. Another early novella from this period, \"Ein Abend zu L\", contains insights on sex and homosexuality which anticipate Freudian psycho-analytical notions. Dr. Tony Page writes on this:\n\n\"In view of its daring delineations of human sexuality and repressed sexual urges, its potentially progressive view of same-sex love and general exploration of the human psyche in the grip of passion, \"Ein Abend zu L.\" constitutes a remarkable early 19th-century literary document, providing pre-echoes of psycho-analytical ideas that would take the Western world by storm less than a century later.\"\nHalm's other short stories, or novellas, which tend to focus on spiritual issues and self-destructive monomaniacal characters, are far superior to most of his dramas and are striking and impressive in content, full of psychological insights—especially his earliest major story, \"Das Auge Gottes\" (\"The Eye of God\"), a lengthy novella written in 1826, about the supernatural reverberations of the blasphemous act of the desecration of a holy icon, and his final narrative masterpiece, \"Das Haus an der Veronabrücke\" (\"The House on Verona Bridge\"), centring on the inner collapse of a man given over to a morally repellent but overriding (the enforced sexual coupling of his wife with another man). His novella, \"Die Marzipan-Lise\" (\"Marzipan Lise\"), is credited with being one of the first \"criminal fiction tales\" of German literature and is now available as an audio book on CD. Furthermore, the composer, Brahms, used some of Halm's verse as the basis for a number of his Lieder.\n\nOverall it can be said that it is as a short-story or \"novella\" writer that Halm has secured a place in the history of German/Austrian literature. His novellas mark Halm out as a writer of talent, psychological penetration and substance. His novella, \"The House at Verona Bridge\" (\"Das Haus an der Veronabruecke\") alone stands as a milestone in 19th-century Austrian literature for its probing and insightful treatment of an obsessive mentality that inevitably leads its possessor into tragedy and death.\n\nHis collected works, \"Samtliche Werke\", were published arranged in chronological order in eight volumes (1856–1864), to which four posthumous volumes were added in 1872. Also published were \"Ausgewählte Werke\", ed. by Anton Schlossar in 4 vols. (1904). Published in the 21st century in Amazon Kindle format were a collection of poems entitled \"Unpublished Poems of Friedrich Halm\" (2011), the full text of Halm's novella, \"Das Auge Gottes\" (2011), as well as Halm's novella, \"Ein Abend zu L.\" (2012), in addition to Halm's essay on literary aesthetics, \"Sendschreiben an J. C. R.\" (2012), all transcribed and edited by Dr. Tony Page.\n\n\n\nEnglish translations of the novellas, \"Das Haus an der Veronabrücke\" and \"Das Auge Gottes\":\n\n\n\n\n"}
