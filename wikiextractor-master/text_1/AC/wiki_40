Classical authors give various accounts of the Celtici's relationships with the Gallaeci, Celtiberians and Turdetani.\n\nSeveral classical sources, Greek and Roman, mentioned the Celtici.\n\nThe Celtici were not considered a barbarian people. On the contrary, they were what the Greeks considered a civilized people, almost in the same degree as the Turdetani.\n\nTheir main cities were Lacobriga (probably Lagos in the Algarve), Caepiana (in Alentejo), Braetolaeum, Miróbriga (near Santiago do Cacém), Arcobriga, Meribriga, Catraleucus, Turres, Albae and Arandis (near Castro Verde and Ourique). Other important cities were Nertobriga, Turobriga, Segida, Ebora, Caetobriga and Eburobrittium (Óbidos), among other settlements.\n\nThey appear to be the main group responsible for the \"celticization\" of the Conii, in the Algarve.\n\nThe origin of the Baeturian Celts was, according to Pliny, from the Celtici of Lusitania and were also kin to the Gallaeci:\n\nThese migratory patterns have persisted on the same axis until modern times, supporting a centuries-old traditional and seasonal farming and animal husbandry transhumance along the ancient Roman or Carthaginian Silver road that served for its rich mines production transport, and for the Astorga region peddlers and wagoneers, the Maragatos.\n\nPliny also noted that already in Roman times the inhabitants of Miróbriga (one of the Celtic cities of the region, near Santiago do Cacém) used the surname of \"Celtici\": \"Mirobrigenses qui Celtici cognominantur\". In the sanctuary of Miróbriga a resident leaves their Celtic origin recorded:\n\nTraditional theories hold that the Celtici were a group that included several \"populi\", namely the Saefes and the Cempsii, of unknown origin, which according to modern research possibly belonged to one of the first settlements of Celtic origin; and initially perhaps also the possible proto-Lusitanians (the \"Ligus\", \"Lusis\" or \"Lycis\"), all mentioned in the \"Ora Maritima\" (\"Sea Coasts\") of Avienus, and possibly reinforced with subsequent waves.\n\nThe main Eburones’ cities were their presumed capital \"Ebora\" (Évora), \"Segovia\" (archeological site near Campo Maior, Elvas), the coastal town of \"Mirobriga Celticorum\" (archeological site near Santiago do Cacém), and five other towns within Alentejo. Around the 3rd Century BC they managed to push southwards towards the western Algarve coast where they founded the port of \"Laccobriga\" (Monte Molião, near Lagos) in Conii territory. In Baeturia, the Bituriges set their capital at \"Nertobriga\" (Cerro del Coto, Fregenal de la Sierra – Badajoz) whilst the Turones placed theirs at \"Turobriga\" (Llanos de La Belleza, near Aroche – Huelva) and both peoples controlled six other cities.\n\nIn Baetica the Celtici held or had a presence in some city-states, namely \"Celti\" (Peñaflor – Seville), \"Urso\" (Osuna – Seville), \"Obulco/Obulcula\" (Castillo de la Monclova, Fuentes de Andalucía – Seville; Iberian-type mint: \"Ipolca\"), \"Tribola\" (Baena – Córdoba), \"Munda\" (Montilla? – Córdoba), \"Tucci/Itucci\" (Los Martos, near Jaén – Córdoba), \"Turobriga\" (Turón – Granada), \"Cartima\" (Cártama – Málaga), \"Arunda\" (Ronda – Málaga) and \"Acinipo\" (Ronda la Vieja – Málaga).\n\nFurther North in Gallaecia, another group of Celtici dwelt the coastal areas. They comprised several \"populi\", including the Celtici proper: the \"Praestamarci\" south of the Tambre river (\"Tamaris\"), the \"Supertamarci\" north of it, and the \"Neri\" by the Celtic promontory (\"Promunturium Celticum\"), whom Strabo considered related to the Celtici of Lusitania, settled in Gallaecia after a military campaign held jointly with the Turduli Veteres. Pomponius Mela affirmed that all the inhabitants of the coastal regions, from the bays of southern Gallaecia and up to the Astures, were also Celtici: \"All (this coast) is inhabited by the Celtici, except from the Douro river to the bays, where the Grovi dwelt (…) In the north coast first there are the Artabri, still of the Celtic people (\"Celticae gentis\"), and after them the Astures.\" He also mentioned the fabulous isles of tin, the \"Cassiterides\", as situated among these Celtici.\n\nThe Celtici Supertarmarci have also left a number of inscriptions, as the Celtici Flavienses did. Several villages and rural parishes still bear the name \"Céltigos\" (from Latin \"Celticos\") in Galicia. This is also the name of an archpriesthood of the Catholic Church, a division of the archbishopric of Santiago de Compostela, encompassing part of the lands attributed to the Celtici Supertamarci by ancient authors.\n\nArchaeology confirms that the material culture of the southwestern Celtici was deeply influenced by the Arevaci of Celtiberia and beyond, as their metalwork shows strong parallels with south-central Gaul, Liguria, Etruria, and central Italy. The Baetic Celtici soon fell under the cultural influence of their Iberian Turdetani neighbors, as well as receiving Hellenistic elements from the Carthaginians.\n\nSubmitted to Carthaginian rule just prior to the 2nd Punic War, the Celtici of Alentejo and Beturia recovered their independence in 206 BC whereas their Baetic counterparts simply shifted their allegiance from Carthage to the Roman Republic. In 197 BC the \"Ultima Celtiberia\" was included in the new Hispania Ulterior Province, though they were only conquered by the Ulterior \"Praetor\" Tiberius Gracchus the Elder in 179 BC. \nThe Beturian Celtici tribes however, rose in support of a Turdetanian rebellion soon afterwards, and allied with the Lusitani and Vettones, promptly began to raid the lands of the Roman Spanish allies in Baetica and the Cyneticum throughout the 2nd Century BC. They proved to be the most reliable allies of the Lusitani – whose chieftain Viriathus used western Beturia as a rear base for its military operations on the south – in deep contrast to the Celtici city-states of Baetica, who frequently changed sides according to circumstances.\nWhen the tide turned against the Lusitani in 141 BC, the Beturian Celtici were subjected to the punitive campaigns conducted in the Iberian southwest by Consul Quintus Fabius Maximus Servilianus, who invaded eastern Beturia and plundered five towns allied with Viriathus.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2099797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099797", "title": "Covers (Show of Hands album)", "text": "Covers (Show of Hands album)\n\nCovers is the eighth studio album by English acoustic roots duo Show of Hands. The album was released in 2000 by the duo's own label Hands on Music. The album exclusively features cover versions of thirteen songs by the duo, chosen and recorded to reflect the band's contemporary musical influences. As such, the album contains no Steve Knightley compositions. The album was recorded over two days in Chudleigh Town Hall, Devon, with producer Gerald O'Farrell, and features only \"straight performances\", with its songs being untouched by post-production or techniques such as overdubbing or double tracking, presenting a \"live\" sound. The album followed their limited edition release \"Folk Music\" (1998), which featured the band's versions of traditional folk songs, and was the duo's first array into creating an album of music without Knightley compositions.\n\nThe album was released to a positive critical reception, with Dave Tuxford of \"Living Tradition\" was \"superbly produced\" and that \"it's unlikely that you'll be less than impressed.\" The album's cover version of Billy Joel's \"The Downeaster 'Alexa'\" was featured on the band's compilation album \"\" (2007). A follow-up album of cover versions, \"Covers 2\", was recorded with Miranda Sykes and released in November 2010.\n\nIn 1996, Show of Hands performed at the Royal Albert Hall, London, with the performance resulting in the live album \"Live at the Royal Albert Hall\". The performance was not expected to be a success, but tickets sold out in advance, and the live album became the band's best-selling album. Steve Knightley of the duo noted that as a result of its success, \"it's easier to get in local papers. But we now need to replace that with a story about the music. That's the dilemma.\" The following album \"Dark Fields\" (1997) was ultimately a critical success, despite its single \"Crazy Boy\" underperforming commercially.\n\nAfter touring in promotion of \"Dark Fields\", the duo recorded \"Folk Music\" (1998), an album featuring the band's new versions of traditional folk songs, released only for a short time at the band's concerts and on their website. The duo had not previously recorded an album of music that did not feature any compositions by Knightley, disregarding the album's rendition of \"The Train\". Although the album was a limited edition, its concept would prove inspirational on the duo for their next album. With Knightley releasing his solo album \"Track of Words\" (1999), Show of Hands did not want to work on another album featuring Knightley's songs so quickly, and instead, the duo decided to record an album of cover versions that reflected the band's increasing number of contemporary influences.\n\nThe album was recorded at the Town Hall of Chudleigh, Devon, over two days in January 2000. Recording with regular producer Gerald O'Farrell, the duo decided on capturing a \"live\" sound for the album, with no post-production work. The album contains what Knightley described as \"straight performances\"; the duo set up a small PA system in the hall and recorded into it, with Knightley noting that what \"came out on the other end was the finished production\". As such, the album contains no multitracking or overdubs, and the duo are the only musicians to feature on the album, becoming their first album not to feature guest musicians.\n\nThe album contains thirteen cover versions, chosen by the duo to reflect some of their contemporary musical influences. The album has been described as \"eclectic\". One of the songs, \"Counting is a Pleasure\", is a traditional song, featuring Nic Jones' arrangement of the song. The album opens with a \"sensitive reading\" of Ian Anderson's \"Wond'ring Around\". Their cover version of Lowell George's \"Willin'\" was described as \"gutsy\", whilst their version of Mike Chapman's \"lament to a lost love\", \"No Song to Sing\", is complemented by their version of Ralph McTell's \"leaving song\", \"The Setting\", which the duo had \"skilfully interwoven\" with the traditional Celtic piece \"Mary from Dungloe\". The album concludes with an acoustic version of The Kinks' \"Waterloo Sunset\".\n\nThe album was released in early 2000 on the band's own label Hands on Music with the catalogue number HMCD12. The album's artwork is completely black and white, bar the silver face of the CD. The album received a positive reception from music critics. Dave Tuxford of \"Living Tradition\" praised the album as an \"eclectic collection ranging from Tom Robinson to Bob Dylan\" and noted to readers that \"if you're a fan you're bound to enjoy this CD, superbly produced as usual by Gerard O'Farrell. Even if you're not, it's unlikely that you'll be less than impressed.\"\n\nFollowing its release, the band returned to recording albums of their own compositions, beginning with \"Cold Frontier\" (2001). Nonetheless, in November 2010, they released a follow-up album to \"Covers\" entitled \"Covers 2\". The album, a collaboration with Miranda Sykes, was again an attempt to reflect the duo's influences. In 2007, the duo's cover of Billy Joel's \"The Downeaster 'Alexa'\" from \"Covers\" was featured on the band's best-of retrospective compilation album \"\". The cover appeared on the second disc, \"Longdogs\", whose track list was decided by fans of the band were asked to choose their favourite songs from each of the duo's albums on polls created on the band's former internet forum Longdogs.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2099799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099799", "title": "Edward McTiernan", "text": "Edward McTiernan\n\nSir Edward Aloysius McTiernan, KBE (16 February 1892 – 9 January 1990), was an Australian lawyer, politician, and judge. He served on the High Court of Australia from 1930 to 1976, the longest-serving judge in the court's history.\n\nMcTiernan was born in Glen Innes, New South Wales. He graduated from the University of Sydney in 1915, and was called to the bar the following year. McTiernan was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1920, representing the Labor Party, and was soon after appointed Attorney-General of New South Wales. He served as attorney-general under John Storey, James Dooley, and Jack Lang, but left state politics in 1927. McTiernan was elected to the House of Representatives in 1929, but served for little over a year before Prime Minister James Scullin nominated him to the High Court. He was 38 at the time; only H. V. Evatt (another Scullin nominee) was appointed at a younger age. On the court, McTiernan was considered a moderate, and was known for the consistency of his decisions. He generally favoured the position of the federal government, upholding the constitutionality of contentious legislation from both sides of politics. McTiernan retired reluctantly at the age of 84, after just under 46 years on the High Court bench. He lived to the age of 97, and was the last surviving MP from the 1920s.\n\nMcTiernan was born in Glen Innes, New South Wales, the second of three sons born to Isabella (née Diamond) and Patrick McTiernan. His parents were Irish Catholic immigrants; his father worked as a policeman. McTiernan began his education at Metz Public School, located in a small settlement west of Hillgrove. He and his family moved to Sydney in 1900, when he was about eight. He completed his education at Catholic schools, Christian Brothers' High School, Lewisham, and St Mary's Cathedral College.\n\nMcTiernan left school in 1908 initially lacking the funds to attend university, instead joining the Commonwealth Public Service as a clerk. He eventually began studying part-time at the University of Sydney, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1912. He subsequently served his articles of clerkship at Sly & Russell while completing a Bachelor of Laws, graduating with first-class honours in 1915. He was called to the bar the following year and was taken on as an associate of Justice George Rich, whom he would eventually join on the High Court. He was rejected for military service during World War I due to an arm fracture sustained in childhood that had never properly healed.\n\nAfter five years as a barrister, McTiernan was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1920 as the Member for Western Suburbs. McTiernan served in the ministry as Attorney-General of New South Wales from April 1920 to April 1922 and again from June 1925 to May 1927, He was heavily involved in Premier Jack Lang's attempt to abolish the New South Wales Legislative Council. He retired from the Assembly in 1927 and took up a position as a law lecturer with his \"alma mater\". Two years later, however, he was elected to federal parliament as the member for Parkes. This was to be short-lived, as in 1930, one year into McTiernan's term, Prime Minister James Scullin nominated him to the High Court of Australia, along with H. V. Evatt. Their appointment was controversial, due to their youth (McTiernan was 38 and Evatt 36), perceived inexperience, and political connections – both were members of the Labor Party up until taking office, and the Labor caucus had publicly resolved \"that the government should appoint to the bench two men known to have social views sympathetic to Labor\".\n\nAs a judge of the High Court, McTiernan was involved in several significant cases in Australian legal history, including \"Bank of New South Wales v Commonwealth\", which struck down an attempt to nationalise the banks, \"Australian Communist Party v The Commonwealth\", which struck down an attempt to ban the \"Communist Party of Australia\" and \"R v Kirby; ex parte Boilermakers' Society of Australia\", which reinforced the doctrine of the separation of powers. He was the sole dissenter in \"Attorney-General (Vic) ex rel Dale v Commonwealth\" (1945), which struck down the Chifley Government's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and triggered a constitutional amendment. He served under five Chief Justices - Sir Isaac Isaacs, Sir Frank Gavan Duffy, Sir John Latham, Sir Owen Dixon and Sir Garfield Barwick, and was knighted himself in 1951.\n\nMcTiernan was one of only eight justices of the High Court to have served in the Parliament of Australia prior to his appointment to the Court; the others were Edmund Barton, Richard O'Connor, Isaac Isaacs, H. B. Higgins, John Latham, Garfield Barwick, and Lionel Murphy. He was also one of six justices to have served in the Parliament of New South Wales, along with Barton, O'Connor, Albert Piddington, Adrian Knox and H. V. Evatt.\n\nMcTiernan was a member of the High Court for 46 years, making him the longest-serving judge in its history. This record is unlikely to be broken, as a constitutional change in 1977 introduced compulsory retirement ages for federal judges; a justice of the High Court must now retire at 70. McTiernan had no intention of resigning from the bench even into the 1970s, but, after breaking a hip at the age of 84 in 1976 while chasing a cricket in his hotel with a rolled up newspaper, Chief Justice Barwick's refusal to include a wheelchair ramp in the design of the new High Court building prompted his retirement.\n\nIn 1943, McTiernan was approached by Attorney-General H. V. Evatt to conduct an inquiry into claims that test results at the Aircraft Production Commission Testing Laboratory in Sydney had been fabricated. This might have compromised the structural integrity of Bristol Beaufort bombers being used by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Arthur Calwell, the Minister for Information, applied strict wartime censorship to the inquiry, with no press coverage allowed. The full report has never been made public, although a summary prepared for cabinet is held by the National Archives. McTiernan was effectively granted the powers of a Royal Commissioner. His inquiry is the third and most recent occasion on which a sitting High Court judge was called upon to investigate a matter on behalf of the federal government (usually regarded as a breach of separation of powers). The other two instances occurred during World War I, when George Rich and Samuel Griffith conducted Royal Commissions.\n\nAccording to Jack Lang, McTiernan was \"very much attached to his parents\". He did not marry until the age of 56, wedding Kathleen Lloyd on 27 December 1948 at St Roch's Catholic Church, Glen Iris, Melbourne. The couple had no children. McTiernan died in Turramurra, Sydney, on 9 January 1990, at the age of 97. He was buried in Rookwood Cemetery. He is the oldest lived High Court judge, and at the time of his death was the last remaining member of parliament from the 1920s.\n"}

He is also known for his contributions as a singer, rhythm guitarist and songwriter for the post-hardcore band Alexisonfire. In 2005, he debuted his first full-length album, \"Sometimes\", which achieved platinum certification in 2006. City and Colour began performing in small intimate venues between Alexisonfire tours. The name \"City and Colour\" comes from his own name: \"Dallas\", a city, and \"Green\", a colour. His reasoning for the name was that he felt uneasy \"putting the album out under the name Dallas Green\".\n\nGreen was born on September 29, 1980 in St. Catharines, Ontario. Green was named after Philadelphia Phillies manager Dallas Green. Green has stated that he had gone without a name at first; his mother was considering naming him Graham-Todd Green, but his father had bet on the Phillies during the 1980 World Series that October and, after the team won, his parents decided on the name Dallas after the Phillies' manager.\n\nGreen started playing piano at the age of 8 and writing music since he was around the age of 14. The first album that he bought with his own money was Alice in Chains' \"Dirt\" (1992). He bought it on his 12th birthday, on September 29, 1992. Green said that if people want to get to the bottom of why he makes music the way that he does, it is because of Alice in Chains.\n\nRegarding the songs released on his first album, \"Sometimes\", Green said that he had been writing material for it as early as when he was 16 years old, and finished writing songs for it in 2005.\n\nBefore joining Alexisonfire, Green was in a band called Helicon Blue, producing several songs before breaking up. The three piece band also featured Marcel Lanteigne on bass and vocal, and Nicholas Osczypko on drums. The band recorded a self-titled release on their own, subsequently recording a second EP with Greg Below from Distort Entertainment. A collection of nine Helicon Blue tracks were released by Dine Alone Records in 2016 as a part of their 10-year anniversary celebrations.\n\nDallas began playing with Alexisonfire in late 2001. They released four albums (\"Alexisonfire\", \"Watch Out!\", \"Crisis\", and \"Old Crows / Young Cardinals\") and two EPs before disbanding in 2011 due to Dallas' decision to focus on his work in City and Colour full-time.\n\nDallas came up with the name of the band from an episode on Discovery Channel. This specific episode was about contortionism. In this show there was a segment on a stripper who added contortionism into her show, as well as lactating and breathing fire. The woman's stage name was Alexis Fire, and the segment was called Alexisonfire. He thought that this would be a cool name for a band, and that is where it all started.\n\nIn 2003, Dallas appeared (along with Alexisonfire vocalist George Pettit) on Jude the Obscure's album \"The Coldest Winter\", doing additional vocals on 3 songs. He contributed vocals to Neverending White Lights' collaborative album \"\", released in 2005, on the song \"The Grace\". Green provided additional vocals on the track \"INRihab\" with Every Time I Die as well as on the track \"Black Albino Bones\" with Fucked Up on their second full-length album, \"The Chemistry of Common Life\".\n\nGreen began releasing City and Colour songs on the internet for fans to download. Eventually, he compiled and rewrote several of these songs to make his first album, \"Sometimes\". The full-length debut was released on November 1, 2005, to a good reception, described by one reviewer as \"dynamically gentle and vulnerable\". The cover art was designed by Scott McEwan, in a tattoo-esque style; Green \"still may decide to have some of them inked at a later point in time\".\n\nGreen indicated that his view that the \"best music for [him] is sad music\", influenced the type of songs he created. He also said that he \"love[s] music to sort of escape to\" and the idea of sad music that people could identify with. Green said of the album that, \"a lot of those songs are written on some of the experiences I've been through and stuff and that's just how I deal with it. I just write songs when I'm bummed out and I feel happier.\" \"Sometimes\" won the 2007 Juno award for Alternative Album of the Year.\n\n\"Bring Me Your Love\" is Green's second full-length album. It was released on February 12, 2008 and features a wide array of instruments not used on his previous recordings (such as harmonica, banjo, drums and lap steel) giving it a more folk-influenced sound. The album also features collaborations with other musicians, such as Canadian musician Gordon Downie of The Tragically Hip on the track \"Sleeping Sickness\", and additional instrumentals done by Matt Sullivan and the members of Attack in Black. The lead single, \"Waiting...\", peaked at No. 32 on the Canadian Hot 100.\n\nThe album is named after a short story by Charles Bukowski. It is also a line sung in the closing track, \"As Much As I Ever Could.\" Green has stated that he saw Bukowski's book in a book store while on tour and adopted the title for his new album.\n\nOn September 26, 2008, City and Colour embarked on their first American tour, in support of \"Bring Me Your Love\". On the tour, the band supported Tegan and Sara along with Girl in a Coma. This tour was followed by a headlining tour of the US in January 2009, with support from William Elliott Whitmore. In October 2008, Dine Alone Records announced a special 2-disc limited edition of \"Bring Me Your Love\" to be released on December 2, 2008. Only 6,000 copies were available; 5,000 in North America and 1,000 in Australia.\n\nIn January 2010, City and Colour embarked on an additional US headlining tour, again supporting \"Bring Me Your Love\", with supporting act Lissie, and an additional UK tour in June 2010, supporting P!nk, along with Butch Walker, along with a few headlining dates. On these tours, Dallas Green has performed two new songs by the titles of \"Silver and Gold\" and \"Oh Sister\", as well as a couple of never-played-before covers - \"Murderer\", originally by Low, and \"Grinnin' In Your Face\", originally by Son House. In an interview with Alter the Press, Green has revealed that he has written a bunch of new songs and he just needs to record them for his next record, hinting on a possible early 2011 release date for his third studio album. He said that there are 15 songs that he really likes and he expects around 10 to appear on his next album.\n\nOn September 2, 2010, it was announced on MTV News Canada that Green had been in the studio with Polaris Prize nominee Shad working on a remix of a Shad song as well as an original song to be released as a 12\" vinyl single. Dallas was quoted as saying \"I've always wanted to be the Mary J. Blige to somebody's Method Man\". The remix is to Shad's song \"Listen\" from his latest album \"TSOL\", and the new song that Green co-wrote is titled \"Live Forever\". On September 30, 2010, it was announced that Green planned to start recording his third studio album in January 2011, after demoing 14 songs. \"There are a lot of musically unusual songs.\" Green has said about the record, \"There's a lot more piano on these songs, keyboards and stuff. And there are a couple of songs almost I would say a bit rockin', if that makes any sense, not in a heavy metal kind of way, but just a little bit more upbeat than what you're used to hearing from me.\"\n\nOn November 9, 2010, Green announced via Twitter that he would be releasing a new single on iTunes called \"At the Bird's Foot\" which will be on a compilation album called \"Gasoline Rainbows\", which also features new songs by such artists as Damien Rice and Amy Kuney. The song was written by Green in response to the oil spill in the Gulf. All proceeds from the album will go directly to Global Green USA. \"At the Bird's Foot\" was first made available for 48-hour streaming on the Gasoline Rainbows Myspace page on November 23, 2010, and features Amanda Zelina of the band The Coppertone on vocals. In an interview with Reverb Magazine's Sean Frazer, Green spilled news of an upcoming 2011 album release, saying \"Hopefully I am going to start recording in January so I'm hoping that there will be another album by next Summer/Spring.\"\n\nOn February 15, 2011, Green performed a specially recorded version of \"Northern Wind\" on the Valentine's Day episode of One Tree Hill. On February 23, 2011, it was officially announced on the Dine Alone Records website that City and Colour's third album will be titled \"Little Hell\" and is set for release in June 2011. On March 23, 2011, the official track listing was posted on City and Colour's official website. Release date for the album was set to June 7, 2011. In an interview with Radar Radio's Reegan McLaughlin, Green said 'I look at people like Bob Dylan back in the day and he'd have pages of lyrics and would have to decide out of seven, eight of nine verses which three were the best. I think to myself, I have to struggle to get two verses I am happy with in a song' Green also said 'I think melodies come relatively easy to me because I've been singing so long but lyrics, it's a battle to get to a point when I am happy with a song.'\n\nOn March 27, 2011, City and Colour performed Neil Young's \"Old Man\" as part of the four song tribute to Toronto during the Juno Awards of 2011. On April 5, 2011, \"Fragile Bird\", the first single off \"Little Hell\" was released to the radio. The song had its world premiere on Australian radio station Triple J, where the band was touring a sold-out tour at the time. The single became City and Colour's highest charting single, reaching No. 1 on the Canadian rock/alternative chart. City and Colour has been announced to be performing as part of The Voodoo Experience 2011, which is held at City Park in New Orleans, Louisiana on October 28–30. On August 5, 2011, Alexisonfire announced their break-up. George Pettit wrote a message on the band's official website saying Dallas had been planning to leave to focus on City and Colour, as balancing the two bands had become too difficult.\n\nOn December 17, Biffy Clyro announced that City and Colour would be the main support on their 2013 arena tour, in support of their new album.\n\nCity and Colour announced the release of the new album entitled \"The Hurry and the Harm\" to be released on June 4, 2013. The song \"Of Space and Time\" was released on March 11, 2013 prior to the announcement of the new album. The track listing includes 12 songs; the special iTunes deluxe version, available for pre-order in April, will include 3 extra tracks for a total of 15 new songs. The song \"Thirst\" was released on April 1, 2013 on City and Colour's Soundcloud page. The album was unofficially leaked on May 22, 2013. The album cover shows Green's face which felt weird for him, since he always wanted his music to be about his songs and not about himself.\n\nIn October 2014, City and Colour was selected as the headline act for the grand opening of the Meridian Centre, St. Catharines' new 50 million dollar hockey and performance arena.\n\nCity and Colour announced the release of the new album entitled \"If I Should Go Before You\" to be released on October 9, 2015. The song \"Woman\" was released exclusively on Beats 1 station on Apple Music on July 16, 2015, hosted by Zane Lowe.\n\nIn September 2018, City and Colour announced the release of a new compilation album of live songs called \"Guide Me Back Home\". It was recorded during Dallas' 2017 \"An Evening with City and Colour Solo Canadian tour\", to be released digitally on October 5, 2018, and physically on November 23, 2018, via Still Records, a new record company set up by Dallas himself.\n\nThree tracks from the album were released digitally on September 21, 2018, \"Casey's Song\", \"Sensible Heart\" and \"As Much as I Ever Could\". A further three tracks were released a week later on September 21, 2018, \"The Girl\", \"O'Sister\" and \"Lover Come Back\".\n\nIn April 2019, City and Colour was the opening act for Alice in Chains' Canadian tour and other three U.S. concerts in support of their album \"Rainier Fog\". Green is a longtime fan of the band and has cited them as one of his early influences. He joined them on stage for a rendition of their song \"Nutshell\" (a song that Green would often cover) during their concerts at the Budweiser Gardens in London, Ontario on April 23, 2019, and at the FirstOntario Concert Hall in Hamilton on April 24, 2019. He also sang \"Got Me Wrong\" with the band on April 25 in Rama, on April 27 in Montreal, and on April 28 in Quebec. Alice in Chains' guitarist and vocalist Jerry Cantrell gave one of his guitars to Green after they performed together at the MTELUS in Montreal on April 27, 2019. Green has stated that Cantrell made him fall in love with playing a guitar.\n\nOn June 3, 2019, the band debuted their first new song in four years called \"Astronaut\" and also announced a 22-date North American tour starting in October 2019. A further single called \"Strangers\" was released on June 21.\n\nOn August 15, 2019, the band's album \"A Pill for Loneliness\" was announced and at midnight on August 16, a third song, \"Living in Lightning\", was also released as a single. Green said in a statement about the album, \"I wrote a lot of dark songs and wrapped them in the most beautiful sounds we could find, there are personal connotations, but they're also relatable. I'm thankful for the opportunity to create.\" The album was released on October 4, 2019. In January 2020, the album received a Juno Award nomination for the Adult Alternative Album of the Year.\n\nOn September 8, 2014, Green announced a collaboration with Pink.

The results of a census he passes on to us informs about the following: «The jurisdiction of Lucus contains 15 peoples both unimportant and bearing outlandish names, excepting the Celtici and the Lemavi, but with a free population amounting to about 166,000. In a similar way the 24 states [civitates] of Braga contain 285,000 persons, of whom besides the Bracari themselves may be mentioned, without wearying the reader, the Biballi, Coelerni, Callaeci, Equaesi, Limici and Querquerni (Naturalis Historia, III, 3, 28).\n\nThe main city of the Coelerni was Coeliobriga, now Castromao in Celanova (Ourense, Galicia, Spain). This Castro was inhabited from the 6th century BC until the beginning of the 4th century CE.\n\nA Treaty of Friendship between the Coelerni and the Romans was made in 132. A Tessera Hospitalis was found stating a pact of hospitality between the tribe of the Coelerni, thus accepting their peaceful integration in Hispania Citerior, and the Roman military commander of the Legion VII Gemina Civitas Limicorum, Gneo Antonius Aquilus Novaugustanus, in exchange for their defence under Emperor Hadrian.\n\nThe exact text of the Tessera Hospitalis states:\nG(neo) IVLIO. SERVIO. AUGURINO. G(eneo) TREBIO.\nSERGIANO. CO(n)S(ulibus).\nCOELERNI. EX-HISPANIA. CITERIORE.\nCONVENTUS. BRACARI. CVM. G ( neo). AN\nTONIO. AQUILO. NOVAUGUSTANO.\nPRAEF(ecto). COH(ortis). I.

{"id": "2099823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099823", "title": "Nordic Passport Union", "text": "Nordic Passport Union\n\nThe Nordic Passport Union allows citizens of the Nordic countriesIceland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finlandto travel and reside in another Nordic country (and Svalbard) without any travel documentation (e.g. a passport or national identity card) or a residence permit. Since 25 March 2001, all five states have also been within the Schengen Area. The Faroe Islands are part of the Nordic Passport Union but not the Schengen Area, while Greenland and Svalbard are outside both.\nHowever, Greenland has an open border with all Nordic countries, and allows Nordic citizens to enter, settle and work without requiring a passport or permits. Svalbard allows Nordic citizens to settle and work without permits, as a result of the Svalbard Treaty, however with the exception of Norwegian citizens, valid travel documentation (such as a passport, or a national identity card from a European Union or EFTA country) is required to enter Svalbard. Furthermore, as citizens of a Nordic country, those from Svalbard and Greenland are permitted to reside in any other Nordic country.\n\nFor Nordic citizens, no identity documentation is legally required to enter or reside within any Nordic country. However, identity documentation is still useful, as companies may require proof of identity for certain services, such as trains, airports, age check for alcohol purchase, or for services aimed at residents, like banking, picking up postal packages or dealing with authorities. Usually any valid proof of identity is accepted, in many cases local identity documentation like ID card from bank or other trusted private institute are accepted. An important exception is the \"temporary\" border controls which were introduced in 2015 and which as of 2020 still are in place.\n\nWhen traveling to other countries than the Nordics, public officials in the foreign services of any of the Nordic countries are to assist citizens of another Nordic country if that country is not represented in the territory concerned, according to the Helsinki treaty.\n\nThe Nordic Passport Union was established in three stages. In 1952, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland agreed to abolish passports for travel between them and to readmit citizens of other countries who had entered illegally into one of the four countries from another. On 1 July 1954, the agreement was extended to allow citizens to reside and work in any of the four countries without a residence or work permit. Iceland implemented the agreement on 1 January 1966. Passport checks for citizens of non-member countries at the borders between member countries were removed by a treaty between Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland signed on 12 July 1957 and which came into force on 1 May 1958. The treaty was extended to Iceland on 24 September 1965 and to the Faroe Islands on 1 January 1966. Greenland and Svalbard remain outside the passport union.\n\nIn December 1996 the two non-EU member states Norway and Iceland signed an association agreement with the signatories of the Schengen Agreement to become part of the Schengen Area. While this agreement never came into force, both countries did become part of the Schengen Area after concluding similar agreements with the EU. The Schengen Convention itself was not open for signature by non-EU member states.\n\nFrom 25 March 2001, the Schengen \"acquis\" applied to the area of the Nordic Passport Union with the exception of the Faroe Islands. Border checkpoints have been removed within the Schengen Area, in addition to those that had been abolished previously within the Nordic Passport Union. In the case of the Faroe Islands, which are not part of the Schengen Area but remain part of the Nordic Area, the strict Schengen rules apply to travellers from the Faroe Islands into the Schengen Area, including the Nordic countries, but the Nordic rules allowing for an open border apply to those going the other way from the Nordic countries, but not necessarily from the other Schengen countries. However, citizens of the Nordic Passport Union countries enjoy extra rights within the Nordic area, not available under Schengen, such as less paperwork if moving to a different Nordic country, and fewer requirements for naturalization or citizenship. Within the Nordic area, any Nordic identity documentation (e.g. a driving license) is valid as proof of identity for Nordic citizens because of the Nordic Passport Union, while a national identity card or a passport can be required in other Schengen countries. Most Scandinavian people do not own any Schengen approved national ID card, so they need a passport when visiting most Schengen countries outside the Nordic area, having in mind that most Schengen countries on the continent require possession of identity documentation by anyone, generally checked by hotels.\n\nBefore 2001, full customs checks were required for ferry travel when travelling from Denmark to other Nordic countries. There was no land border with Denmark before July 2000 when the Öresund Bridge was opened, which had relaxed customs check from the start. Nordic citizens did not need to be in possession of a passport. Other citizens needed a passport. As a part of the customs check, at least when arriving from Denmark and non-Nordic countries, every car driver was asked about where they had been. For land and ferry travel into Denmark and between Sweden, Norway and Finland, there were much more relaxed customs and passport checks, and often no checks at all. For air travel, there were full passport and customs checks, even though verbally claiming Nordic citizenship with a Scandinavian language, plus showing the ticket for the intra-Nordic flight, or any Nordic identity documentation, was usually enough to pass the passport check. It happened that Nordic citizens without a passport were not allowed to pass until a thorough identity investigation had been made. Passengers travelling by public transport, such as train or air, were usually not interviewed by the customs control. \n\nFrom March 2001, the Schengen rules have given more relaxed customs checks from Denmark, including no passport checks at airports, since intra-Schengen travellers are separated from the travellers from outside the Schengen area. Still laws give police and guards the right to demand an identity document at airports which is usually not enforced inside Nordic countries, at least not before 2015.\n\nThe protocol concerning the abolition of passports for travel between Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway was signed on 14 July 1952, in Stockholm.\n\nThis protocol was implemented by the individual but concurrent decisions of the four governments. It abolished the need for citizens of the four countries to carry a passport when travelling in the three other countries provided that the trip was for such a short time that a residence permit was not necessary.\n\nThe agreement could be revoked in case of war, danger of war, or extraordinary international or national circumstances.\n\nOn 26 July 2014 the Norwegian police for the first time suspended this agreement due to a perceived terrorist threat.\n\nThe agreement for the readmittance of aliens, was signed on 14 July 1952, in Stockholm.\n\nThe agreement provides that any alien, i.e. persons not citizens of the Nordic countries, having illegally entered one of the Nordic countries directly from another Nordic country should be readmitted by that country, unless that person has stayed at least a year in that country or has received either a residence or work permit.\n\nThe protocol concerning the exemption of nationals of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden from the obligation to have a passport or residence permit while resident in a Nordic country other than their own, was signed on 22 May 1954 in Copenhagen.\n\nThe protocol was implemented by individual but concurrent decisions by the governments of each of the countries, and can be revoked in case of war, danger of war, or other extraordinary international or national circumstances.\n\nThe protocol provides that citizens of the Nordic countries can travel without passport or other travel documentation to any other Nordic country. Citizens of the Nordic countries can reside without residence permit in any other Nordic country.\n\nPolice authorities in the Nordic countries shall make all necessary information available to ascertain a person's identity and citizenship in a Nordic country.\n\nThe agreement between Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden to remove passport control at the internal Nordic borders, was signed on 12 July 1957 in Copenhagen and came into force on 1 May 1958.\n\nThis agreement removed all passport checks at the internal Nordic borders, and required the Nordic countries to uphold passport control at the external borders. Aliens with residence permits are allowed to stay up to three months in other Nordic countries, except for seeking employment or conducting business.\n\nAliens who are denied entry into one Nordic country should also be denied entry into the other Nordic countries. The Nordic countries are also obliged to readmit aliens that should have been denied entry at the first point of entry.\n\nIn November 2015, Sweden and Norway introduced temporary border controls, and requirements for all international airlines and ferries to check identity documents, due to the European migrant crisis. From 4 January 2016, Sweden required bus and train carriers to perform identity checks on the Danish side of the Denmark–Sweden border, while still retaining the border controls on the Swedish side. These controls where heavily criticised for violating the rules laid out in title III of the Schengen acquis prohibiting such carrier responsibility within the Schengen area, and were subsequently abolished by the Swedish government on 4 May 2017 to avoid potential formal sanctions. At the border, a traveller will need to be able to present a passport (and appropriate Schengen visa if required), an EU/EEA national ID card, or a Nordic driver's license. However, identity cards recognised in the Nordic countries, like ID cards issued by banks or by the Swedish Tax Agency are not accepted.\n\nThe European Commission has been notified regularly of the ongoing temporary border controls at internal borders at every extension of the duration. As of August 2019, 7 extensions have been made and are currently in force to the 12 November 2019\n\nThis table refers to intra-Nordic passport controls, which violate the intention behind the Nordic Passport Union. They are legal according to the treaty since it is adopted to the Schengen agreement. Besides these intra-Nordic passport controls, Denmark has passport controls at its land border to Germany, and Sweden, Norway, and Denmark have passport controls on airports and seaports for arrivals from the continent.\n\n"}

Harrenstein. Its purpose is to provide a site-independent, machine readable date and time.\n\nThe Time Protocol may be implemented over the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). A host connects to a server that supports the Time Protocol on port 37. The server then sends the time as a 32-bit unsigned integer in binary format and in network byte order, representing the number of seconds since 00:00 (midnight) 1 January, 1900 GMT, and closes the connection. Operation over UDP requires the sending of any datagram to the server port, as there is no connection setup for UDP.\n\nThe fixed 32-bit data format means that the timestamp rolls over approximately every 136 years, with the first such occurrence on 7 February 2036. Programs that use the Time Protocol must be carefully designed to use context-dependent information to distinguish these dates from those in 1900.\n\nMany Unix-like operating systems used the Time Protocol to monitor or synchronize their clocks using the rdate utility, but this function was superseded by the Network Time Protocol (NTP) and the corresponding ntpdate utility. NTP is more sophisticated in various ways, among them that its resolution is finer than one second.\n\nOn most UNIX-like operating systems a Time Protocol server is built into the inetd (or xinetd) daemon. The service is usually not enabled by default. It may be enabled by adding the following lines to the file /etc/inetd.conf and reloading the configuration.\n\n\n"}

His name was derived as a result of his association with the city of Madurai as a protector of the city.\n\nMadurai veeran is worshiped as a guardian deity by the Tamils. The folklore is that the town of Madurai was troubled by bandits and the Pandyan king ordered Veeran to resist. Veeran then met Vellaiyammal, a royal danseuse, who was attracted to him because of his looks and skill in various arts. She asked him to teach her the Natya Shastra (tenets of dancing).\n\nThe Pandyan king, who was himself attracted to Vellaiyammal, did not appreciate this development and viewed this as an affair. Some of his generals, who hated the closeness of Veeran to the king, used the opportunity to inform the king that the delay in suppressing the robbers was deliberate as Veeran was conniving with the robbers themselves. Furious, the king ordered a traitor's death for Veeran, who was taken to the gallows and had his limbs chopped off. Hearing of this, Bommi and Vellaiyammal attend the gallows to see the severed limbs and chastise the king for his injustice.\n\nThe legend says that Veeran is brought back to life by the virtues of both these women and is vindicated by the presence of gods.

{"id": "2099842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099842", "title": "Salfords", "text": "Salfords\n\nSalfords ) is a village in the borough of Reigate and Banstead in Surrey, England. It lies approximately south of Redhill on the A23 London to Brighton road. The village is within the civil parish of Salfords and Sidlow which covers a population of 3,069, and has a parish council.\n\nSalfords means \"willow-tree ford\" from Old English \"sealh\"/\"salh\" \"willow\" and \"ford\" \"ford. The name was recorded \"Selefrid\" in 1193. This is similar to the derivation of Salford, Greater Manchester. \n\nThe village has its own 20th century church, Christ The King, primary school, cricket club, some shops, cafes, a social club, a tanning salon, a number of restaurants and a take away. Salfords Stream runs through the village and can cause flooding in the autumn and winter months. The southern boundary is marked by the Burstow stream. Both are minor River Mole tributaries, itself a tributary of the River Thames. The only buildings old enough to be listed structures in the village are two adjoining houses on Brighton Road and The Mill House Hotel on the Salfords Stream.\n\nThe village once boasted a wooden watermill with two sluice gates next to the Mill House Hotel. It produced breakfast cereals in the early twentieth century. By the 1950s it was defunct and has since been dismantled and partly washed away.\n\nSalfords made the national news in January 2008 when a farmer named Robert Fidler built a personal home at Honeycrock Farm similar in style to a Tudor castle and disguised it with hay bales and tarpaulin for four years in an attempt to avoid planning permission from Surrey County Council.\n\nSurrey Police applied for planning permission in 2010 for permission to build a 30-cell custody suite at the IO business centre to replace the existing facility at Reigate. This was extremely unpopular with the residents who packed out two meetings with Surrey Police in the local village hall to air their concerns over increases in crime and traffic, resulting in the first meeting being postponed to a larger venue. Surrey Police continued with the planning application despite the overwhelming opposition of the community, but the application was subsequently refused by Reigate and Banstead Council in June 2010. Surrey Police announced in December that they were appealing the decision; this has now been referred to the Planning Inspectorate.\n\nSubsequently the Planning Inspectorate decided to ignore the wishes of both the local community and the council and have granted permission to Surrey Police to build the facility to a revised design.\n\nUntil the 1970s Salfords was part of Horley and with its own Victorian Chapel Church, owing its existence to the construction of the A23 road. The original trackway passed just to the east, on the other side of what is now the London to Brighton railway, dated as pre medieval.\nThis trackway came from Redhill, passing in front of the Royal Earlswood Hospital, through Whitebushes and crossing the stream/river 'Sal' at Dean Farm, Salfords. It then ran in front of the former Monotype Corporation site towards the Horley gasometer, passed the moated Thunderfield Castle (a 13th-century manor) on 'Harolds Lea' and reached the south coast near Brighton.\n\nIn the 1870s a state school was built on the fork between the London Road and Pendleton Road on Petridge Common. The school consisted of four classrooms three were divided by sliding glass doors. The head teacher was located upstairs above the cloakrooms. In World War II two air raid shelters were built on opposite sides of the long tapering playground. In the mid-1950s the then \"Salfords County Primary School\" started to expand and relocated to Copsleigh Avenue.\n\nThe railway station was built in 1915 to enable workers access to the Monotype Corporation factory. Today it is served by London Bridge/London Victoria to Horsham trains. On the main road Hall & Co, the dominant building materials supplier in the south east of England had their regional maintenance depot, used in WWII to repair war tanks.\n\nSalfords Cricket Club is a village cricket club. The club runs two Saturday League sides in the Surrey Downs League and a Sunday friendly side. The club host a \"Cricket Week\" of mid-week games each July, and a tour every August. The club now play on a council-owned ground on Petridge Wood Common, off Woodhatch Road. Salfords Cricket Club was formed in 1921. The Club's first captain was Tom Enever, whose photograph can be seen in the pavilion today. The Council relocated the club to its present ground at Petridge Wood Common in 1960.\n\n"}
{"id": "2099845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099845", "title": "Crowd control (video games)", "text": "Crowd control (video games)\n\nCrowd control (also called CC) is a term used in MMORPGs (Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games) and MOBAs (Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas) to refer to the ability to limit the number of mobs actively fighting during an encounter. It can also refer to abilities that influence or prevent the abilities or actions of other characters. Crowd control can be extremely powerful, controlling the possible outcomes of an encounter, as it forces opponents to use a smaller set of abilities/actions. Players use crowd control to create offense/defense ratio imbalances between themselves and their opponents; used properly, CC often renders an opponent nearly useless, allowing the CCer to use abilities/actions against an opponent without fear of retaliation or response. In a group setting, crowd control often makes combat safer, easier, or viable.\n\nAll crowd control abilities fall into one or more of three broad categories.\n\nThe ability to move faster than an opponent provides a form of crowd control, often through kiting. Any modifier that decreases an opponent's speed will allow more efficient kiting.\n\nMany forms of crowd control use this type of modifier. Traditionally, \"root\" and \"snare\" effects that directly modify opponents' movement rates by lowering them or simply preventing movement have been the staple of this type of crowd control.\n\nThe abilities include, but are not limited to:\n\n\nAbilities that can decrease the number of times one can perform an action in a given time (usually by increasing cast time and/or cooldown time) or stop a player from performing actions all together.\n\nAbilities in this group may include, but are not limited to:\n\nThese abilities can also affect the amount of \"energy\" to perform an action, be it mana or otherwise.\n\nOthers can decrease damage given from actions, or increase healing from allies.\n\nThis is the most unusual category of crowd control spells, but abilities that fall under it are often considered the most powerful. These abilities force an opponent to use certain abilities without their consent.\n\nExamples include, but are not limited to:\n\n\nCrowd control is generally considered critical in EverQuest, because most monsters in the modern version of the game are a match for an entire group of player characters.\n\nIn \"EverQuest\", crowd control is usually handled by the Enchanter and Bard classes, who can mesmerize (\"mez\") opponents through spells or songs. These stop a monster from being able to attack players; however, if the monster is affected in such a way that its hit points are reduced, the mesmerization is broken and the monster will immediately begin to attack. The duration of these effects varies by class and level. Bards can generally only mesmerize for 18 seconds at a time, but higher level Enchanters can mesmerize monsters for upwards of 72 seconds. Several types of monsters are entirely immune to this effect, and all mesmerization spells will only mesmerize monsters up to a certain level.\n\nStuns can be used for crowd control in \"EQ\" as well. Enchanters are the primary class for this method, with a full range of point-blank AOE (PBAOE) stuns. With three or more loaded PBAOE stuns, they can \"stun lock\" opponents by casting the next stun before their previous stun expires. Some other classes, such as the Cleric and Necromancer, also have a limited ability to perform crowd control in this fashion, generally by using short-duration targeted stuns.\n\nAnother method of \"Everquest\" crowd control is to keep the monster occupied, such as by assigning a player to \"tank\" it. This is made much more effective by the use of abilities that Taunt targets, forcing them to attack the user. Only certain classes can Taunt. Monsters can also be charmed and sent against other mobs. Only creatures up to a certain level can be charmed, and charms are usually of random duration. With additional skills, charms can be made fixed duration or even permanent. Charms generate a lot of hate, so the character doing the charming runs the risk of becoming the target of attacks from the mob.\n\nIn \"World of Warcraft\" different classes have different crowd control abilities. As of version 1.12, every class has at least one spell that can render an enemy target (player or non-player) unable to move and/or attack for a short period of time. Some of these spells have a cooldown, while others can be chain cast and used to incapacitate a non-player target for as long as required.\n\nIn general, longer and more powerful crowd control effects render the victims immune to damage or will break after they take damage, and in PvP combat these effects have so-called diminishing returns, which means applying the same effect repeatedly will decrease the length of the effect for the next application. Generally, the third application of the same effect in a short period of time renders the target immune to that effect for 15 seconds, which is also the time for the diminishing returns' timers for an effect to reset.\n\nDeath knights can silence enemies and interrupt their spell-casting, stop them and make them gradually regain their full movement speed, and if specialized for it, fully incapacitate all targets around them for a short period of time by encasing them in blocks of ice. In addition, death knights have a unique spell called Death Grip, which can also be considered a crowd control effect as the ability instantly pulls an enemy target to them.\n\nDruids can put beast and dragonkin type monsters to sleep, root enemies in place with a vine spell, and incapacitate any enemy (player or non-player) for a short duration with Cyclone, which causes the victim to be immune to any damage or healing.\n\nHunters are able to set up freeze traps that can encase an opponent in a solid block of ice as they walk over it, frost traps to slow movement considerably in a small radius, and snake traps which slow movement and cause damage. They can also scare beasts making them run \naround in fear for a while. If specialized for it, hunters can also cast a scatter shot which disorients the target or a wyvern sting which puts the target to sleep.\n\nMages can use a spell called Polymorph to turn humanoid and beast type enemies into harmless sheep or other critters for 50 seconds (10 seconds in PvP), although the victim will regenerate health very quickly in this state. Any damage done to the target will remove the effect and will be in vain if the victim is polymorphed again, as the victim will regenerate to full health in just a few seconds. Mages can cripple their opponents' spell casting ability as well by using Counterspell, which will force the target to interrupt their spellcasting and block similar spells for a few seconds. The Frost Nova spell roots multiple targets in place around the mage for several seconds and can also be used for crowd control, while Blast Wave allows mages specialized in it to snare enemies in a radius.\n\nPriests can perform an AoE fear every 30 seconds and they have the ability to Mind Control enemies. They also can shackle undead type enemies, rendering them unable to move or attack for 50 seconds.\n\nPaladins can stun enemies for six seconds with the Hammer of Justice spell every minute and fear undead and demon monsters, preventing attacks and forcing them to run away.\n\nRogues, while in stealth and out of combat, are able to Sap a humanoid opponent that is not in combat, incapacitating it for up to one minute. Most methods of crowd control in WoW, will initiate combat with the target, so the victim will attack the player when the incapacitating effect wears off. However, Sap is a notable exception; neither the Sapped victim nor the surrounding enemies will engage in combat. Like most crowd control spells, the Sap effect will also be removed by any damage, but it cannot be applied repeatedly in combat. Rogues have other types of crowd control effects mostly for PvP combat, such as stuns, poisons.\n\nShamans have the ability to reduce a single opponent's movement speed (Frost Shock) and a group of opponents' movement speed (Earthbind Totem). They can also interrupt a target's spellcasting with Wind Shear, similarly to the way mages can with Counterspell, however Wind Shear's cooldown and duration of the spell block effect is lower. Hex, introduced in the \"Wrath of the Lich King\" expansion, allows shamans to turn enemies into a frog for a short period of time, rendering them unable to attack but free to move around.\n\nWarlocks can banish elementals and demons, making them immune to everything, but unable to move or attack. Using a Succubus (a summoned demon), warlocks can seduce humanoids, causing them to stand love struck and unable to act. Warlocks can also cast Fear on their opponents, making them run around in panic. There is no cooldown on this ability and it can affect any creature type.\n\nWarriors have various stun and spell casting interrupt abilities. Protection warriors (tanks) can stun a whole pack of enemies in front of them with their Shockwave ability. Warriors can also intimidate enemies around them with a fierce shout, making them run around or freeze in fear for a short time.\n\nIn \"City of Heroes\" and its expansion, \"City of Villains\", the Controller archetype is the primary provider of crowd control effects. Controllers, depending on their primary power set, have a variety of options for crowd control—essentially all of the effects in the above list—but the most commonly used effect is the Hold, which prevents an opponent from attacking or moving at all for a time. Dominators, a \"City of Villains\" archetype, share the Controllers' crowd control abilities, but with substantially reduced duration under most circumstances. To balance this limitation, a Dominator has access to an inherent power called \"Domination.\" After a Dominator has inflicted enough damage with his or her attacks, this power can be activated, which doubles the duration and \"magnitude\" of his crowd control effects for a short time. Domination allows the Dominator, when it is most needed, to provide considerable crowd control and damage.\n\nHowever, while Controllers and Dominators are designed to provide crowd control, all other archetypes have access to some crowd control effects; for instance, all Blasters have access to Immobilization effects in their secondary power sets. Crowd control in \"City of Heroes\" is generally very short in duration and not particularly effective on large groups of opponents or powerful opponents (such as Bosses, Archvillains, and Giant Monsters), in keeping with the game's design principles. This limitation is a function of \"magnitude,\" which can be circumvented to a degree by using multiple crowd control effects or by augmenting magnitude using Domination. Because of these problems, crowd control is not considered an essential function in \"City of Heroes\", and many groups operate effectively without a Controller or any appreciable use of crowd control effects by simply overwhelming their opponents with massive force. In Issue 5, all crowd control was substantially weakened by reducing the duration and increasing the recharge of powers that offer it, especially if those powers could affect multiple targets. This has further deemphasized its role in gameplay.\n\nAs in \"EverQuest\", crowd control can also be provided by having a sufficiently resistant character, such as a Tanker, Scrapper, or Brute archetype character, keep the opponents occupied by \"tanking\" them. Tankers and Brutes are intended to be much more effective in this role, and it is not unheard of for a Tanker to \"tank\" upwards of 10 opponents at once and survive. Tankers, Scrappers, and Brutes all have powers that Taunt, which makes this task easier, but changes to the game in Issue 5 limit the number of targets that can be effectively controlled in this fashion, and the overall reduction in character defense makes tanking more dangerous. As of Issue 7, the Mastermind archetype has an inherent power called \"Bodyguard\" that, under specific circumstances, allows him to redistribute damage taken to his pets. Despite his limited hit points, a Mastermind can act as a \"tank\" using this power if carefully played.\n\nIn \"City of Heroes\" PvP combat, Controllers and Dominators who successfully Hold an opponent inflict triple normal damage with their powers. In Issue 5, Controllers gained a similar version of this advantage in the rest of the game through a new inherent power called \"Containment.\" This power allows a Controller to inflict double damage against any target that is suffering from a Hold, Immobilize, Sleep, or Disorient effect. A similar version of Containment is part of the inherent power of Stalkers, Assassination. These characters have a chance to land a critical hit for double damage against any target under a Hold or Sleep effect in both PvP and PvE combat.\n\nIn \"Ultima Online\", the most common CC spells are Paralyze and Poison (although Poison is meant to be a debuff or damage over time, it also prevents a character from healing himself with certain methods). There are other CC abilities that also prevent healing as well as a spell known as Force Field, meant to block passages. Two skilled players can create a \"cross\" by casting Force Field along the X and Y axes of the map, locking the target in place for a time much longer than Paralyze. This allows them to subsequently cast spells for a longer time without fear of retaliation from the target (unless the target can attack from afar, like archers and magical users).\n\nIn MOBAs, crowd control refers to anything which prevents or limits a player or mob’s ability to fight, as well as impair their ability to move. There are a wide variety of types of crowd control, and most player-controlled characters have some means of crowd control. The most common forms of CC are slows, which decrease the player’s movement, cripples which reduce attack speed, and stuns, which stop the player from moving or performing any actions. The support (tank) role will usually have more forms of CC than other roles due to their playstyle being more about defense and area control.\n\nThere are also other forms of CC in MOBAs, including silences, which remove the player’s ability to cast spells or abilities; taunts, which force the player to run to a certain point or character (usually the caster of the taunt); hex, which transforms the player into a harmless creature and unable to perform any actions other than moving; fears, which force the player to run away from a certain point or character (usually the caster of the fear), and many other forms of CC that take place in their respective game.\n"}

He mounted his first horse ever at 16.5 years old and was racing professionally by 18. At only 19 years old (his first year as a jockey) Chris McCarron wove a spell that brought his mounts to the winner's circle 547 times in 1974, breaking all records for most races won in a year. The previous record was set by Sandy Hawley in 1973 with 515 wins in a year.\n\nHe was introduced to the sport of thoroughbred racing by his older brother, jockey Gregg McCarron. Chris McCarron began riding professionally in 1974 at East Coast racetracks where he won the 1974 Eclipse Award for Outstanding Apprentice Jockey in the United States.\n\nHe moved to race in California in 1977, a year he scored his first of three wins in the Kentucky Oaks. In 1980 he won the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Jockey as best overall jockey and that same year his peers voted him the prestigious George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award. In 1991, he was voted the Mike Venezia Memorial Award for \"extraordinary sportsmanship and citizenship\".\n\nMcCarron won nine Breeders' Cup races, including five Breeders' Cup Classics, and rode six winners in the U.S. Triple Crown Races. Other major wins for McCarron include the Del Mar Oaks (4), Del Mar Futurity (4), Del Mar Handicap (6), Del Mar Debutante Stakes (3), La Jolla Handicap (7), San Bernardino Handicap (6), Clement L. Hirsch Handicap (7), San Felipe Stakes (7), Florida Derby, Eddie Read Handicap, Bing Crosby Handicap, Jockey Club Gold Cup (2), Arlington Million, Fantasy Stakes (4), San Clemente Handicap (5), Hollywood Gold Cup, Woodward Stakes (2), Santa Anita Handicap (3), Haskell Invitational (2), Santa Anita Derby (4), San Diego Handicap (6), Pacific Classic, Canadian International and Japan Cup. McCarron led all North American jockeys in earnings in 1980, 1981, 1984 and 1991. He also topped the leaderboard in wins in 1974, 1975 and 1980.\n\nIn 1989, Chris McCarron was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. After 28 years in racing he retired in June 2002. He finished as thoroughbred racing's ALL-TIME leader in purse earnings with more than $264 million in winnings and 7,141 races won. He won about 21% of the races he rode, a percentage that only 5 jockeys have ever held.\n\nIn 2003, McCarron served as a technical advisor, racing designer and actor in the 2003 film \"Seabiscuit\". That same year he was hired by Magna Entertainment Corp. to serve as Vice President and General Manager of Santa Anita Park. After resigning his job at Santa Anita in January 2005, he announced he would be opening the first ever riding academy in the United States: the North American Racing Academy which is part of the Kentucky Community and Technical College System. In 2008, he was working as a racing analyst for TVG Network for only a year.\n\n\n"}

Also, TNN poorly advertised and promoted ECW, producing barely any press releases or TV ads, even though ECW was TNN's highest rated weekly program at that point. The only real time that TNN actually advertised ECW was during the ECW program itself. In fact, during ECW broadcasts, there were actually commercial ads for the archrival WCW's programs, such as \"Thunder!\" Heyman decided to recruit Don Callis, who played the part of Cyrus, to serve as a metaphor, so to speak, for the real problems between ECW and TNN at that point.

Following the duo's successful Royal Albert Hall performance in 2001 which was televised as \"The Big Gig\", the duo released the studio album \"Cold Frontier\" in September of that year, which saw the duo use a more basic instrumental set up that what they had grown accustomed to. A critical success, they followed it with The Cold Frontier Tour in November 2001. The tour was unusual in that the duo opted to perform both obscure older material and cover versions in re-arranged formats, in addition to material from \"Cold Frontier\". Many of the tracks had never featured on a Sho of Hands album before. A critical success, the duo and Mick Dolan had recorded performances from the tour for usage as the live album \"Cold Cuts\".\n\nThe album was released on 22 July 2002 by the duo's own record label Hands on Music. It reflects the unusual tour's track listing and re-arrangements, and was a critical success, being seen as more than just a souvenir for the tour and being a worthwhile acquisition in its own right. Despite being their sole live album to contain unreleased material, the album is often overlooked by the duo. Unlike other CD-released albums by the duo, none of its songs feature on their retrospective compilation album \"\" (2007), nor is the album referred to in its booklet.\n\nAfter releasing their sixth studio album \"Dark Fields\" (1997), Show of Hands focused on releasing albums of material by other artists, namely an album of traditional folk music, \"Folk Music\" (1998), and an album of contemporary cover versions designed to reflect the duo's contemporary influences, \"Covers\" (2000). The latter album presented a stripped down sound with no overdubs or multitracking. They followed this with their second concert at the Royal Albert Hall which was filmed for their VHS concert film \"The Big Gig – Show of Hands @ The Royal Albert Hall\" (2001). The film was filmed by ITV franchise holder Carlton Productions, who broadcast it on ITV Carlton as two dedicated half-hour programmes. The performance and television transmission, which themselves were a measure of the reputation the duo had built up until then, had increased interest in the duo. They recorded their ninth studio album, \"Cold Frontier\" (2001), which was co-produced between the duo and Mick Dolan, engineer for Steve Winwood, after their previous producer and manager Gerrard O'Farrell left for Australia.\n\n\"Cold Frontier\" was their first album composed by Steve Knightley of the duo since \"Dark Fields\". Recorded in early 2001 by the River Exe in Countess Wear, Devon, the album saw the duo return \"to a more basic instrumental setup\" than what they had grown accustomed to. One description noted that the duo had \"created their own unique musical style by combining the narrative strengths of English and Celtic traditional music with instruments and textures from other cultures.\" The album was critically acclaimed, and they followed this with the seven-date The Cold Frontier Tour in November 2001. The tour was unlike previous tours by the duo; in addition to performing songs from \"Cold Frontier\", the opportunity was taken to revisit older material and showcase some new arrangements of songs from other writers both familiar and unfamiliar. The tour, which was called a \"triumph\" by one critic, was recorded in part by Mick Dolan for usage as a live album. The duo's previous live albums, \"Show of Hands Live\" (1992) and \"Live at the Royal Albert Hall\" (1996), both document a single concert each, but the Cold Frontier Tour live album would be a compilation of tracks recorded across the tour. The duo named the album \"Cold Cuts\" (cold cuts), both a pun on \"Cold Frontier\" and also a reference to \"deep cuts\", a musical term meaning music that is generally not well known, reflecting the content of the tour and album itself.\n\n\"Cold Cuts\" was recorded over each concert of the tour and, according to the duo, features \"the new, the rearranged, and the previously unreleased songs\" that they played on the tour. The album features a track list faithful to the material on the tour, featuring songs from \"Cold Frontier\", obscure older material and showcase some new arrangements of songs from other writers both familiar and unfamiliar. Roughly half of the album is cover versions, some of which had been in the duo's repertoire for a while but not all of which had previously been recorded or released onto an album. One review noted that some of the cover versions are \"quite radical rethinks\", but that \"none prove any less than pretty fine as covers go\". The cover versions of Free's \"My Brother Jake\", Leonard Cohen's \"First They Take Manhattan\" and Mike Lennon's \"Rose in the Thorn\" have been described as being \"surprising choices\" upon initial inspection, but that \"show Of Hands really make them their own\". The \"submarine-driven reading\" of Cyril Tawney's \"Sally Free and Easy\" is energetic.\n\nKnightley's own Show of Hands songs on the album has mostly been re-arranged from their original versions. \"Faith in You\" and \"Track of Words\" feature pared down settings and revised pace, which puts a different complexion on the songs from their fulsome production on the earlier studio recordings. The latter song was never previously recorded by Show of Hands, originally being the title track on his 1999 album of the same name. An inspired medley, where \"The Battle of the Somme\" and \"Time After Time\" frame \"The Keeper\", features over three songs.\n\nThe album was released 22 July 2002 by the duo's own record label Hands on Music, with the catalogue number HMCD17. It was their first album packaged in a digipak since \"Dark Fields\". All of the duo's subsequent albums released on Hands on Music have been released in digipaks. The album was released to a positive critical reception. Dave Kidman of \"NetRhythms\" said that \"\"Cold Cuts\" presents a sequence of live recordings from that tour, and gives a very good indication of the duo's compelling live presence and uniformly high level of instrumental and vocal accomplishment.\" He was particularly praiseful of the re-arrangements of the duo's own material, and concluded that \"all in all, \"Cold Cuts\" does its job really well, and in the end represents rather more than just a satisfying add-on tour memento for existing fans, being a worthwhile acquisition for its own sake.\" Despite the critical favour, the album been somewhat ignored by the duo. No recordings from the album featured on their retrospective compilation album \"\" (2007). The second disc of that album, subtitled \"Longdogs\", featured one track each from every one of their albums, the specific tracks being chosen by an individual poll on the duo's former internet forum Longdogs. Whilst the rest of the duo's albums are covered, except for the early cassette releases which were effectively replaced with the compilation \"Backlog 1987–1991\" (1995), \"Cold Cuts\" was the sole album omitted from the track listing. Additionally, it is also not written about in the liner notes.\n\nAll songs written by Steve Knightley, except where noted.\n\n\nAll tracks were recorded during November 2001.\n"}

He is the second and current Archbishop of Galveston-Houston, serving since 2006. He previously served as Bishop of Sioux City from 1998 to 2004. On November 12, 2013, he was elected as the Vice President of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. On November 15, 2016, he was elected as the President of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, exercising a leading administrative role in the Catholic Church in the United States, until his term ended in November of 2019.\n\nDiNardo was elevated to the College of Cardinals by Pope Benedict XVI in 2007. He is the first cardinal from a diocese in the Southern United States.\n\nDaniel DiNardo was born in Steubenville, Ohio, to Nicholas and Jane (née Green) DiNardo. One of four children, he has an older brother, Thomas; a twin sister, Margaret; and a younger sister, Mary Anne. The family later moved to Castle Shannon, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh. As a child, DiNardo would pretend to celebrate Mass in vestments sewn by his mother and at an altar his father constructed.\n\nHe attended St. Anne Elementary School from 1955 to 1963, and graduated from the Jesuit Bishop's Latin School in 1967.\n\nHe then entered St. Paul Seminary at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, where he was a classmate of David Zubik (who later became Bishop of Pittsburgh). In 1969, DiNardo was accepted as a Basselin Scholar in philosophy at Theological College at Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. and earned a BA in 1971 and MA in 1972, both in philosophy.\n\nHe continued his studies in Rome, earning a S.T.B. at the Pontifical Gregorian University and a S.T.L. at the Patristic Institute \"Augustinianum.\"\n\nDiNardo was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Vincent Leonard on July 16, 1977. He then served as parochial vicar at St. Pius X Church in Brookline until 1980. In 1981, he was named Assistant Chancellor of the Diocese of Pittsburgh and part-time professor at St. Paul Seminary. While at St. Paul, he served as spiritual director to the seminarians.\n\nFrom 1984 to 1990, DiNardo worked in Rome as a staff member of the Congregation for Bishops in the Roman Curia. During this time, he also served as the director of \"Villa Stritch\" (1986–1989), the house for American clergy working for the Holy See, and as an adjunct professor at the Pontifical North American College.\n\nUpon his return to the United States in 1991, he was named Assistant Secretary for Education for the Pittsburgh diocese and concurrently served as co-pastor with Paul J. Bradley of Madonna del Castello Church in Swissvale. He became the founding pastor of Saints John & Paul Parish in Franklin Park in 1994.\n\nOn August 19, 1997, DiNardo was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Sioux City, Iowa, by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following October 7 from Bishop Lawrence Soens, with Bishops Donald Wuerl and Raymond Burke serving as co-consecrators, in the Church of the Nativity of Our Lord Jesus Christ. He adopted as his episcopal motto: \"Ave Crux Spes Unica\", taken from the Latin hymn \"Vexilla Regis\" and meaning, \"Hail, O Cross, Our Only Hope.\"\n\nHe succeeded Soens as the sixth Bishop of Sioux City upon the latter's retirement on November 28, 1998.\n\nDiNardo was later named Coadjutor Bishop of Galveston-Houston, Texas, on January 16, 2004. The diocese was elevated to the rank of a metropolitan archdiocese by John Paul II on the following December 29, and he thus became Coadjutor Archbishop. When Pope Benedict XVI accepted the resignation of Joseph Fiorenza, DiNardo succeeded him as the second Archbishop of Galveston-Houston on February 28, 2006. He received the pallium, a vestment worn by metropolitan bishops, from Benedict XVI on June 29 of that year.\n\nHe once commented, \"There is a certain sense of the church in Texas...It is more laid-back, informal, which I think is good.\"\n\nHe was created Cardinal-Priest of S. Eusebio in the consistory of November 24, 2007. In 2008 he was awarded Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.\n\nOn January 17, 2009, he was made a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture. In March 2009, he described the choice of President Barack Obama to be the commencement speaker for the University of Notre Dame's graduation ceremony as \"very disappointing,\" given Obama's support for legal abortion.\n\nOutside of the Archdiocese, Cardinal DiNardo serves on the Board of the National Catholic Partnership for Persons with Disabilities, a position to which he brings a certain empathy, contending as he does with significant hearing loss in both ears. He also serves on the Board of Trustees of Catholic University of America, is an advisor to the National Association of Pastoral Musicians, is a member of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People and is part of the Ad Hoc Committee to Oversee the Use of the Catechism for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. He is the Grand Prior of the South West Lieutenancy of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, a Papal order of Knighthood, in which he holds the rank of Knight Grand Cross.\n\nHe was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2013 papal conclave that selected Pope Francis.\n\nOn November 14, 2014, at the fall meeting of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Cardinal DiNardo was elected as a delegate to the 2015 Synod of Bishops on the Family, pending Vatican approval.\n\nOn November 20, 2018, it was reported that Cardinal DiNardo has kept two priests accused of past abuse in current active ministry. John LaBonte accused the Rev. John Keller of sexually molesting him at age 16. The abuse allegedly included attempting to get him drunk and fondling him in bed. LaBonte first reported his allegation to the archdiocese of Galveston-Houston in 2002. The archdiocese said in a reply that Keller admitted to \"holding [LaBonte] in a manner inappropriate for a priest\" and promised to admit him to therapy. However, it also stated that Keller \"[denied] any sexual intent\" and claimed that it \"could not conclude that\" what happened \"constituted sexual abuse.\" Keller remained in ministry. Furthermore, in a sworn affidavit, an alleged victim accused Rev. Terence Brinkman of sexual misconduct. The events allegedly took place during the 1970s. The archdiocese stated that the person making the accusation \"provided a physical description that does not match Father Brinkman.\" DiNardo promised to release a list of credibly accused priests in January 2019. In November, CBS News spoke to 20 people who claim to have knowledge of incidents of misconduct, and none of them had been contacted.\n\nOn January 30, 2019, DiNardo released a list of names of 40 priests from the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston who have faced allegations of sexual misconduct deemed credible by archdiocese officials in the past 70 years. One of them was Keller. However, he was criticized for allowing Keller to offer Mass publicly at his parish the morning after the list was released.\n\nDiNardo wears hearing aids because calcium deposits in his ears have impaired his hearing. Despite his hearing difficulties, he still prefers to sing or chant parts of the Mass.\n\nDiNardo suffered a stroke on March 15, 2019.\n\n"}

It was founded in 1960, although it had roots going back several years earlier. It was dissolved in 1992. The membership peaked in 1971 at 1,434.\n\nThe origins of the YSA were in a regroupment of younger members of the SWP with others in the aftermath of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. The principal other component was a group from the Young Socialist League, the youth group of an adult organization called the Independent Socialist League, led by Max Shachtman. The principal figures from the YSL were Tim Wohlforth, Shane Mage, and James Robertson, who joined with young members of the SWP (hence the word \"alliance\") to found the \"Young Socialist\" newspaper. A founding conference of the Young Socialist Alliance was held in April 1960 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, though local Young Socialist supporter groups had existed in several cities for a few years beforehand.\nThe initial YSA central leadership was comprised two rival groups: Wohlforth, Robertson, and Mage who had come over from the YSL, and SWP majority supporters represented by Nora Roberts, Bert Deck, and others. In late 1961 at the second YSA convention, held in Chicago, the SWP central leadership arranged the removal of Wohlforth and Robertson from the YSA on age grounds and replaced the initial majority group with Barry Sheppard and Peter Camejo from Boston, Sheppard as national chairman and Camejo as national secretary. At that time the Young Socialist Alliance had approximately 150 members nationally\n\nAn early activity of the YSA was a national campaign in defense of three of its members who were students at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, Tom Morgan, Ralph Levitt, and Jim Bingham, who were indicted in 1963 by local prosecutor Thomas Hoadley under a little used anticommunist statute. The students were eventually acquitted.\n\nAt the YSA's fourth convention, held over the 1964-65 New Year weekend in Chicago, Jack Barnes succeeded Barry Sheppard as YSA national chairman. Barnes had joined the SWP in Minneapolis while a student at Carleton College in Minnesota. He in turn recruited a number of fellow students, including several who went on to become prominent in the Socialist Workers Party leadership of the next two decades.\n\nThe YSA achieved substantial influence in the anti-Vietnam War movement between 1965 and the early 1970s, including near complete control over the Student Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, a national campus organization with a peak membership of some 100,000.\n\nThe organization went into rapid decline with the end of the war in Vietnam in 1975. By 1980 its membership had fallen to 468, of whom only about 275 were not also members of the Socialist Workers Party. The YSA formally dissolved in 1992. Two years later the Socialist Workers Party created a new youth organization called the Young Socialists.\n\n"}

His first music teacher was most likely his father, organist of the Beauvais Cathedral. At some point during his youth Dumage moved to Paris and studied under Louis Marchand. He also befriended Nicolas Lebègue, who in 1703 procured for Dumage a position of organist of the Saint-Quentin collegiate church. In 1710 Dumage was appointed titular organist of the Laon Cathedral. Due to strained relations with his superiors in the cathedral chapter, Dumage left on 30 March 1719, at the age of 45, and became a civil servant. He apparently neither played nor composed music professionally until his death.\n\nDumage's only surviving work is \"Premier livre d'orgue\", published in 1708. This collection is dedicated to the chapter of Saint Quentin. It contains a single \"Suite du premier ton\": eight pieces in the traditional French forms: \"Plein jeu\", \"Fugue\", \"Trio\", \"Tierce en taille\", \"Basse de Trompette\", \"Récit\", \"Duo\" and \"Grand jeu\". In the brief preface Dumage explains that these are his first works, and that he modelled them after the music of his former teacher Marchand. Dumage's music is, however, of very high quality, and entirely representative of French organ music of the period. Musicologists Félix Raugel and Willi Apel both singled out Dumage's \"Récit\" for its \"delicate and gentle lyricism\", and Apel also praised the \"Tierce en taille\" and the \"Grand jeu\" as particularly striking. Dumage's second \"livre d'orgue\" was presented in 1712 to the chapter of Laon Cathedral, but has never been found.\n\n\n"}

Written, produced, and directed by Andrew L. Stone, the film stars Dirk Bogarde, Maria Perschy, and Alfred Lynch. It is a lighthearted take on the true story of Sergeant-Major Charles Coward, written under the pseudonym John Castle by Ronald Charles Payne and John Williams Garrod.\n\nSergeant-Major Charles Coward (Dirk Bogarde) is a senior British NCO incarcerated in the prisoner of war camp Stalag VIII-B. He encourages his fellow inmates to escape, and tries to humiliate the German army guards at every opportunity.\n\nWhen he was being transferred to Stalig VIII-B, the injured Coward escaped from a forced POW march, finding refuge in a French farmhouse and barn that is soon requisitioned by a German army unit needing to set up a field hospital. Inadvertently thought to be a wounded German soldier, Coward is taken to a hospital, where his identity is soon discovered, but not before he is awarded the Iron Cross as he lies in his hospital bed.\n\nCoward is sent on to POW camp Stalig VIII-B, but on the way to the camp he engineers the total destruction of a passing enemy ammunition train using tossed bundles of straw, lit on fire with his cigarette lighter. At the camp, he is involved in the camp's elaborate tunnel digging schemes and plans an escape with fellow prisoner Bill Pope (Alfred Lynch). Unfortunately, an older, closed tunnel is discovered by camp officials, but not their primary tunnel. Coward then attempts to deceive his camp commander and Luftwaffe officials that he has knowledge of a secret allied bomb sight. He receives special favours, which he uses to bribe guards to get vital materials needed for the coming escape.\n\nWhen his ruse is discovered, Coward is transferred to a Polish work camp where he is set up by the Germans as a traitor, with the camp's commanding officer trying to use his fellow British prisoners to kill Coward. When the scheme fails, he blackmails the Unteroffizier (Reginald Beckwith), who thinks he was responsible for a devastating fire that Coward had actually engineered. Coward extracts an extraordinary privilege in being able to go to and from the neighbouring town without an escort. When he makes contact with an attractive Polish resistance agent (Maria Perschy), he attempts to leave Germany by rail with his new friend providing assistance, but he is captured at a railway station.\n\nAfter the failure of that escape, Coward, along with his other escape partner, Pope, are assigned to the IG Farben work camp. They manage to escape again by masquerading as workmen clearing rubble in a rural area. After learning that the American front line is only a mile away, they steal an unattended fire engine in order to get past the enemy soldiers blocking their escape. Their plan works. A German troop convoy on the road moves aside to allow them to speed past to get to a non-existent fire, and they drive off to freedom.\n\n\nCast notes:\n\n\"The Password Is Courage\" is based on John Castle's biography of Sergeant-Major Charles Coward. Serving as technical advisor during the filming, Coward also has a cameo appearance in the film during a party scene. The film is shot entirely in England; street scenes were filmed in the Chiltern market towns of Amersham and Chesham.\n\nThe film raised some debate among ex-prisoners of war. There are no known survivors of any of Coward's escapes, and the National Ex-Prisoner of War Association (in their Autumn 2006 newsletter) suggested that some of the stories in his biography might have happened to other men in the camps, with some events \"borrowed\" for the book and, subsequently, for the film. In 2013, Shimon Peres, then President of Israel, disclosed that his father, Yitzchak Perski, who immigrated from Poland to Mandatory Palestine in 1932, had joined the British Army in 1939 and was captured by the Germans in Greece in 1941. Perski and Coward had been fellow prisoners, and Peres claimed that some episodes in the film were based on his father's exploits at that time.\n\nThe original cinema version of \"The Password Is Courage\" contained a sequence set in Auschwitz concentration camp, illustrated by drawings. That sequence has been cut from television broadcast prints, but a credit for the drawings remains listed in the film credits.\n\n\"The Password is Courage\" received mixed reviews from critics because this true story of a prisoner of war was done in a jocular vein, and was considered inauthentic as a result. The review in \"Variety\" noted: \"Andrew L. Stone’s screenplay, based on a biog of Sergeant-Major Charles Coward by John Castle, has pumped into its untidy 116 minutes an overdose of slapstick humour. Result is that what could have been a telling tribute to a character of guts and initiative, the kind that every war produces, lacks conviction\".\n\nExplanatory notes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n"}

It has been suggested that the Paesuri were of Thracian origin, though to what extent they were celticized by their neighbors, the Lusitani, Gallaeci and Turduli Veteres, remains unclear.\n\nLocated between the rivers Douro and \"Vágia\" (Vouga), in the modern northern central Portugal, the Paesuri comprised four subtribes – Ireucoutiori, Aravoni, Seareas and Paisicaicoi – which settled the mountains of Freita, Arada, and the northern slopes of Caramulo around the 5th Century BC.\n\nLike their neighbours the Turduli Veteres and Gallaeci, the Paesuri did not fall under Carthaginian rule at the later 3rd Century BC and appear to have not taken part in the 2nd Punic War. It is still not clear if they played any significant role in the Lusitanian Wars of the 2nd century BC. Allied with the Lusitani, they bore the brunt of the first Roman thrusts into the Iberian northwest. In 138-136 BC Consul Decimus Junius Brutus certainly devastated their lands during his punitive campaign against the Lusitani and the Turduli Veteres.

James story \"Casting the Runes\" (1911).\n\nThe film's storyline concerns an American psychologist who travels to England to investigate a satanic cult suspected in more than one death.\n\nThe production was turbulent due to artistic differences that arose between producer Hal E. Chester on one side and director Tourneur and writer Charles Bennett on the other. The original plan was not to show the demon on screen, but Chester inserted a special effects creature over the objections of the writer, the director and lead actor Dana Andrews. To accelerate the pace, the 95 minute British feature was trimmed down to 83 minutes and retitled \"Curse of the Demon\" for the US market, playing there in June 1958 as the second half of a double feature with either \"The True Story of Lynn Stuart\" or \"The Revenge of Frankenstein\" (1958), depending on the local film market.\n\nIn England, Professor Harrington (Maurice Denham) begs his rival, Dr. Julian Karswell (Niall MacGinnis), to rescind the curse he inflicted on Harrington; in return, Harrington will cease his investigation into Karswell's Satanic cult. After learning that a parchment he gave Harrington has been destroyed, Karswell ushers him out and promises to do what he can. As Harrington arrives home, he perceives a gigantic demon materializing in the trees. Harrington tries to escape in his car but crashes into power lines. The authorities declare electrocution as the cause of death.\n\nDr. John Holden (Dana Andrews) arrives in Britain to attend a convention at which Harrington had intended to expose Karswell's cult. He is informed that the only link between Harrington's death and Karswell's cult is a man suspected of murder, Rand Hobart (Brian Wilde), who has fallen into a catatonic stupor. While Harrington's collaborators consider the possibility of supernatural forces, Holden rejects the idea as superstition.\n\nHolden meets Karswell at the Reading Room of the British Museum. When a rare book that Holden requests goes missing, Karswell offers to show Holden his own copy at his mansion. At Harrington's funeral, Holden meets the dead man's niece, Joanna (Peggy Cummins). She gives him Harrington's diary which details Harrington's increasing fear of Karswell's power. Holden remains sceptical, but goes with Joanna to Karswell's mansion the next day. When a very strong windstorm abruptly starts, Karswell claims to have created it with a spell. When Holden mocks him, Karswell grows angry and predicts that Holden will die in three days.\n\nHolden and his colleagues discuss Karswell and make plans to further examine Rand Hobart. Then Holden goes to dinner with Joanna and she shows him her uncle's diary. Harrington's diary mentions a parchment with runic writing on it that was passed to him by Karswell, and Holden finds a similar parchment that Karswell secretly passed to him at the library. A powerful wind comes through the window, blowing the parchment from his fingers towards the fireplace, only to be stopped by the fire guard. Holden then recovers and pockets it.\n\nHolden begins to feel more uneasy after a visit to Hobart's family to seek permission to hypnotise Hobart and find out about the death he is suspected of. The mother gives her consent but says that the family are 'believers'. As Holden leaves, the parchment is blown from his hand again. Hobart's family become fearful and declare Holden to be \"chosen\". Later, Holden compares the parchment's runes to ones inscribed on the nearby stone circle at Stonehenge.\n\nJoanna takes Holden to a séance at the invitation of Karswell's mother (Athene Seyler). The male medium claims to channel Harrington, who tells them that Karswell has the key to reading the runes in his copy of the rare book, but Holden abruptly exits, saying it is all nonsense. After they leave, Joanna says she intends to search for the book's key and they drive to Karswell's mansion. There, Holden insists he will break into the house while she waits outside. Entering through an open window, he is attacked by a cat which seems to morph into a panther. Holden is rescued by Karswell entering and switching on the light, saying he knew Holden would come. Against Karwell's warning, Holden leaves through the woods, as he had arrived, and believes he is chased by a mysterious cloud of smoke and fire before escaping. He and Joanna report the events to the police, but he feels embarrassed by their scepticism and leaves.\n\nUnder hypnosis, the suspect Hobart reveals to Holden that he was \"chosen\" to die by having a runic parchment passed to him, but avoided death by passing it back to the person who had given it to him. When Holden shows Hobart the parchment he had received from Karswell, Hobart thinks he is trying to give it to him and goes berserk and jumps out of a window to his death.\n\nHolden learns Karswell is taking a train to Southampton, and on the train discovers that he has kidnapped and hypnotised Joanna. As the time for Holden's predicted death draws near, Karswell becomes agitated, and when the train stops at the next station, he tries to leave. Holden manages to sneak the parchment into his coat pocket, but when Karswell retrieves it, it flies from his hand. He chases it down the tracks, but as he reaches it the parchment combusts. As an oncoming train approaches, the demon manifests and violently attacks Karswell. When his corpse is found by the tracks, the police believe that he was struck and dragged by the train. Holden is shaken and, instead of going to inspect the body, accepts Joanna's advice that \"it's better not to know\", and they leave together.\n\n\nScreenwriter Charles Bennett owned the rights to the original story \"Casting the Runes\" and wrote a screenplay loosely based on it, using the title \"The Haunted\". He sold his script to independent producer and former child actor Hal E. Chester shortly before going to America. Bennett later regretted selling the script, because on arrival in America he was approached by RKO, who wanted to purchase it and allow Bennett to direct the film. Actors Robert Taylor and Dick Powell had been in line for the leading roles if this production had taken place.\n\nJacques Tourneur was brought in by Chester on the recommendation of Ted Richmond, the producer of Tourneur's previous film, \"Nightfall\" (1957). However, Tourneur and Chester had serious disagreements during filming. One argument was about the wind scene; Tourneur tried to convince Chester to replace two electric fans with two aeroplane engines. When Chester hesitated, star Dana Andrews threatened to leave the picture if Chester did not let \"the director direct the picture\". Locations for the film include Brocket Hall, Hertfordshire (as Lufford Hall), Stonehenge, Bricket Wood railway station and the Reading Room of the British Museum.\n\nAfter completion of the principal shooting, producer Chester decided to show the demon at the beginning and end of the film. Tourneur later said that he was against the addition: \"The scenes where you see the demon were shot without me...the audience should never have been completely certain of having seen the demon\". Stop motion master Ray Harryhausen was requested by Columbia Pictures to create the demon for the production, but he was already committed to his Dynamation film \"The 7th Voyage of Sinbad\" with producer Charles H. Schneer. Author Tony Earnshaw's book \"Beating the Devil: The Making of Night of the Demon\" argues that showing the demon was planned early on in the production (despite Tourneur's protests to the contrary), in order to heighten the tension in the film by letting the audience know the demonic powers were real. Bennett, also angry at the script changes, said \"If [Chester] walked up my driveway right now, I'd shoot him dead\".\n\nThe film was released in the United Kingdom for its theatrical run in December 1957; at its original 96-minute length, it was shown as a double feature with the American film \"20 Million Miles to Earth\". In the United States, it was released as \"Curse of the Demon\". According to Charles Bennett, the title was changed because the studio didn't want it confused with the similarly titled \"The Night of the Iguana\". Columbia cut the film down to 81 minutes for the June 1958 US release. The scenes removed included a visit to the Hobart family farm, a trip to Stonehenge, and snippets of the séance scenes and conversations between Karswell and his mother. \"Curse of the Demon\" toured drive-ins and theatres as a double feature with \"The True Story of Lynn Stuart\" and \"The Revenge of Frankenstein\".\n\nIn the United States, the film was released on VHS in 1986 by Columbia TriStar Home Video with a run time of 81 minutes. A second VHS with the original British 96-minute running time was released by Goodtimes Home Video Corp in 1988. In the same year, the film was released on LaserDisc by Image Entertainment/Columbia Pictures with an 81-minute running time. Including both the UK version (\"Night of the Demon\") and the edited US version (\"Curse of the Demon\"), the film was released on DVD in August 2002.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Night of the Demon\" was released on VHS in 1995 by Encore Entertainment/Columbia TriStar Home Video. The film was released on DVD in the United Kingdom for the first time on 18 October 2010. This release also includes both the UK and US versions of the film. A Blu-ray edition from Powerhouse Films' Indicator label, featuring four different cuts of the film, was released as a UK all-region release on 22 October 2018.\n\nAt the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100%, based on , with an overall weighted average rating of 8.2/10.\nIn a contemporary review, the \"Monthly Film Bulletin\" commented that Tourneur's direction was \"handled with much of the assurance the same director brought to \"Cat People\"\" and that the film was \"way above average\". The review commented on the image of the demon, stating whenever the demon takes on a visible form, \"especially the ending\", it seemed more like a product of \"a child's nightmare than an adult's imagination\".\n\nIn the early 2010s, \"Time Out\" conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. \"Night of the Demon\" placed at number 52 on their top 100 list. Director Martin Scorsese placed \"Night of the Demon\" on his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time.\n\nThe Kate Bush song \"Hounds of Love\" (1985) begins with a sample from the film, using the line \"It's in the trees! It's coming!\"\n\n\n\n"}

Local shopkeeper had objected to the construction of a large mosque in a congested area, so Bukhari Khan acquired a fatwa from local religious leaders in order for construction to begin.\n\nDuring Sikh rule, the mosque was seized by Sikh authorities and converted into a gurdwara, after a copy of the Guru Granth Sahib was installed in the mosque following Sikhs complaints that the Muslim call to prayer from the mosque was disturbing their religious ceremonies at a newly constructed \"baoli\" (stepped well) nearby.\n\nThe mosque was restored in the late 1820s after Fakir Azizuddin persuaded Ranjit Singh to transfer ownership back to the Muslim community. The Muslim community was required to reduce the volume of the call to prayer, and forfeited rent from the leasing of shopfronts.\n\nThe mosque was built on a plinth elevated 11 feet off of the bazaars surface, with shops occupying the ground floor beneath the mosque. The shops rents were used to pay for the mosque's upkeep.

As a result, Crush proceeded to form his own Hells Angels-themed stable. The group consisted of Chainz, Skull and 8-Ball (both of whom are real-life cousins of Chainz). They were introduced on the June 23, 1997 edition of \"Raw is War\" and proceeded to feud with the new Nation of Domination led by Faarooq and Los Boricuas led by Savio Vega.\n\nLate in 1997, Crush left the group, and the WWF in protest of the Montreal Screwjob, and believing he would fare better in WCW. The WWF addressed this by saying Crush was Kayfabe put out of action by Kane. DOA continued as a stable with Chainz assuming leadership. With the loss of Crush, DOA started to team on a semi-regular basis with Ken Shamrock and Ahmed Johnson to battle The Nation of Domination. They also feuded against the Truth Commission and their spiritual leader, The Jackyl.\n\nDuring this time, DOA would make their ring entrances astride custom-made Titan Motorcycles.\n\nAs time passed, Skull and 8-Ball began to focus on their tag team career, leaving Chainz to compete as a singles wrestler. In June 1998, Chainz left the WWF, and Skull and 8-Ball continued as a tag team using the DOA name. They entered a feud with The Legion of Doom and Droz, during the course of which the Legion's former manager Paul Ellering turned on his former charges and sided with DOA. However, that angle soon died out and DOA entered a brief feud with Southern Justice. Soon after that, Ellering left the duo and they formed a short lived alliance with Brian Christopher and Scott Taylor known then as Too Much. Their last match in WWF as a tag team was a defeat to Ken Shamrock and Mankind on May 14, 1999 at a house show. Soon after that angle, DOA left the WWF later in May 1999.

He served in the Norwegian government from 2005 to 2012 as Minister of International Development and Minister of the Environment, and as Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations and Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme from 2016 to 2018. Solheim is a member of the Green Party.\n\nSolheim was formerly a politician for the Socialist Left Party (SV); he led its youth branch, the Socialist Youth, from 1977 to 1981, was party secretary from 1981 to 1985, and served as a member of the Parliament of Norway from 1989 to 2001. He was leader of the Socialist Left Party from 1987 to 1997. During Solheim's tenure as party leader the party moved closer to the centre and abandoned many former hard-left stances. Within the party, Solheim was considered part of the right wing, and his reforms made him strongly unpopular on the left wing of his own party.\n\nIn 2000 Solheim left Norwegian politics to take up an appointment as a special adviser in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs working as a participant in the Norwegian delegation that unsuccessfully attempted to resolve the Sri Lankan Civil War before the outbreak of Eelam War IV. Solheim returned to Norwegian politics in 2005 when he was appointed Minister of International Development. In 2007 he additionally became the Minister of the Environment, and he held both offices until 2012.\n\nAfter leaving the government in 2012, he returned to his previous position as a special adviser in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and from 2013 to 2016 Solheim was Chair of the OECD Development Assistance Committee in Paris. He was Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations and Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme from 2016 to 2018. In November 2018 he stepped down following an internal UN audit that criticized his frequent international travel and some internal rule breaking.\n\nSince he left the government, Solheim sometimes made critical remarks about the Socialist Left Party. Solheim later expressed his support for the centrist Green Party and was active as a strategic adviser for the party during the 2015 elections. He became a member of the Green Party in 2019.\n\nBorn in Oslo, Solheim attended high school at Oslo Cathedral School and, after serving conscription for the Norwegian Air Force in Bodø (1974–75), graduated from the University of Oslo in 1980 with a cand.mag. degree after studying history, sociology and political science. After 11 years in parliament he worked for five years for the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs before being appointed Minister.\n\nSolheim was the leader of Socialist Youth 1977–1980 and party secretary of the Socialist Left Party 1981–1985. In 1987, he became leader of the Socialist Left Party and rose quickly to become a popular figure in Norwegian politics. In the 1989 election he was elected to Parliament from Sør-Trøndelag in what was to then SVs best election, but was the following two elections (in 1993 and 1997 Solheim was elected from Oslo). He was controversial within his own party because he was considered to be too right-wing. In 1997, after ten years as party leader, he stepped down and was succeeded by Kristin Halvorsen. Through the 1990s Solheim became one of the most prominent figures in Norwegian politics, and lead his party through a period of rising popularity. In later years he has received criticism from some older party colleagues for moderating his views on the European Union and becoming a supporter of Norway's membership in NATO.\n\nSolheim was appointed Minister of International Development on 17 October 2005 as part of Stoltenberg's Second Cabinet, the first time Solheim's party sat in the Cabinet. On 18 October 2007, he was also appointed Minister of the Environment. He held both posts until 23 March 2012, when he was—against his own wish—moved by newly appointed party leader Audun Lysbakken.\n\nFrom the spring of 2000 he was granted a leave of absence from parliament to serve as special advisor to the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Sri Lanka. He went on to become one of the most recognizable figures in the peace negotiations between the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tigers.\n\nSolheim helped negotiate a truce in 2002. On 17 October 2005, he continued his engagement with international affairs when he was appointed Minister of International Development in the cabinet of Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg. In this position, he was able to continue his work on the Sri Lanka issue.\n\nSolheim met with the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister and U.S. Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns on 23 January 2006.\n\nAfter meeting with the officials, Solheim told journalists in Colombo, \"Everyone is worried with the present deteriorating security situation. It is hard to see the present situation continuing indefinitely. Sri Lanka is at a crossroads.\"\n\nAfter meeting with Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse, Undersecretary Burns expressed hope that \"the LTTE understands that it will have no relations with my country, and for that matter any effective relations with any country in the world, on the barrel of the gun.\"\n\nPresident Rajapakse and Solheim met the day after. Solheim then went north and met with Tamil Tiger rebel leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and rebel negotiator Anton Balasingham. Dumeetha Luthra of BBC News said Solheim's visit was seen as crucial to saving the truce.\n\nSolheim announced on 12 September 2006 that the Government of Sri Lanka and the Tamil Tigers had agreed to hold \"unconditional peace talks\" in October in Oslo.\n\nSolheim told BBC News officials that \"Both parties have expressed willingness to come back to the table. We expect the violence will be stopped. The government has throughout its existence for 10 months repeatedly told us that they are ready for talks without any preconditions and the LTTE has today confirmed that they are ready for talks without any preconditions.\"\n\nKeheliya Rambukwella, a spokesman for the Sri Lankan government, acknowledged that the government was ready for talks, \"but we did not agree on Oslo for unconditional peace talks.\" Officials from the European Union, Japan, Norway and the United States, meeting in Brussels to discuss the conflict, released a statement in support of the peace talks.\n\nGovernment spokesman Rambukwella denied that the government agreed to unconditional negotiations, saying, \"We will put forward our conditions.\" Rambukwella criticized the Norwegian government for announcing the talks without consulting the Sri Lankan government: \"The government has not been consulted on any future discussions. Norway, or anybody, can't announce dates and venues. We will take it up very seriously. We are a sovereign state. They are only facilitators. We have not delegated any of our powers to them.\"\n\nThe Sri Lankan Government's chief negotiator, Nimal Siripala De Silva, filed an official complaint about Solheim's announcement to the press to Norwegian Ambassador Hans Brattskar when they met, along with Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary S. Palihakkara and Norwegian Embassy spokesman Eric Nurnberg, at the Norwegian Foreign Ministry. Minister De Silva said he hoped to discuss the \"future role of the international community in the Sri Lankan Peace Process and the future course of action on the peace front\" at this meeting. He also expressed a desire for a \"sincere commitment to the process from the LTTE leader Prabakaran\" to reporters.\n\nHis attempts of peacemaking were in the end unsuccessful, with the \"Asian Tribune\" concluding that \"his handling relationship with Sri Lanka\" was an \"utter failure\". In 2010, Minister of Foreign Affairs Jonas Gahr Støre thus instead took control over the bilateral relations between Sri Lanka and Norway, with Eva Kristin Hansen stating that \"Norway will ensure that Norway-Sri Lanka relations are brought back to the way they were.\"\nIn January 2011 Erik Solheim offered to play the role of a “dialogue partner” between the Sri Lankan government and communities living in exile, possibly a reference to the Tamil Diaspora or the LTTE supporters who have formed a government in exile.\n\nIn an interview with journalists Easwaran Rutnam and Jamila Najmuddin, the Norwegian Minister of Environment, who has been often labelled in Sri Lanka as being pro-LTTE, said that the recent Wikileaks reports on him proved that he was not biased towards one party.\nSolheim also rejected the idea of a separate State in Sri Lanka and urged the Tamil Diaspora to seek dialogue and work through democratic means to achieve their goals. The LTTE had recently created a government in exile, also known as the Transnational government of Tamil Ealam which demands for a separate State and obtained the support of the Tamil Diaspora especially those living in Canada.\n\nIn an interview with Sri Lanka's \"Daily News\", Colonel Karuna, a former LTTE regional commander and a current member of the Sri Lankan parliament, levelled claims of Norwegian support for the LTTE and the existence of an exchange of goods, including gifts such as TVs and large sums of money existed between Solheim and LTTE leadership.\nSolheim has denied the allegations made against him and has complained that these accusations are the fabrications of the media.\nThe Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that they are surprised about the \"obvious lies about Mr. Solheim\". also stating that there is \"no basis in reality\" for the accusations. In an open letter to the editor of the \"Sunday Times\" newspaper, in reply to an article published on 15 April 2007, the Norwegian Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Hans Brattskar, also \"categorically refuted allegations made by a Norwegian national, who happened to be a convicted murderer and his organization Norwegians Against Terrorism, to the effect that Norway has funded terrorism.\" also stating that \"Unfortunately, similar allegations based on the very same source, have lately also been published and broadcast by other parts of the Sri Lankan media.\" \"Norwegians Against Terrorism\" is a one-man band led by convicted murderer Falk Rune Rovik. Rovik also posted a video of LTTE leadership visiting the Norwegian Special Forces Training Camp in Rena, which showed the LTTE receiving instruction on their weapons, tactics and military strategies. The content or authenticity of this video was never refuted by Solheim or the Norwegian government.\n\nIn May 2011, \"Aftenposten\" stated that Norwegian Embassy personnel in Colombo had secretly helped LTTE personnel to leave Sri Lanka. This practice was defended by Erik Solheim, who stated that Norway had a long tradition of helping people at risk.\n\nBefore being asked to resign as head of UNEP, Solheim was criticized for his promotion of a vast and environmentally controversial Chinese infrastructure project, the Belt and Road Initiative, as well as Chinese investments in Africa. Solheim defended himself against accusations of nepotism and conflict of interest. Deutsche Welle editorialized that \"his actions paint a questionable picture of a corrupt politician using a position of privilege to his own advantage.\"\n\nIn January 2013, Erik Solheim was appointed head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Development Assistance Committee (DAC). He took over from Brian Atwood who stepped down in December 2012. The DAC is an international forum for bilateral providers of development co-operation. It aims to promote development co-operation in order to contribute to sustainable development. Solheim focussed on reform of official development assistance, providing more support to the least developed countries. He has also sought to blend development assistance with private investment and better taxation systems in recipient countries.\n\nIn May 2016, Solheim was appointed Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme. He succeeded Achim Steiner in that post in June 2016.\n\nA 2018 internal audit by the United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) questioned Solheim's ability to lead the UNEP, particularly in light of his \"extensive travel patterns\" and general management style. As a consequence, the governments of Denmark, Sweden, Japan, Belgium and the Netherlands halted their funding to UNEP, leaving the organisation facing a major funding crisis. On 20 November 2018, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres accepted Solheim’s resignation, after asking him to step down.\n\n"}

It is intended for testing, debugging, and measurement purposes. The protocol is rarely used, as its design flaws allow ready misuse.\n\nA host may connect to a server that supports the Character Generator Protocol on either Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port number 19. Upon opening a TCP connection, the server starts sending arbitrary characters to the connecting host and continues until the host closes the connection. In the UDP implementation of the protocol, the server sends a UDP datagram containing a random number (between 0 and 512) of characters every time it receives a datagram from the connecting host. Any data received by the server is discarded.\n\nOn most Unix-like operating systems, a CHARGEN server is built into the inetd or xinetd daemon. The CHARGEN service is usually not enabled by default. It may be enabled by adding the following lines to the file /etc/inetd.conf and telling inetd to reload its configuration:\n\nThe CHARGEN service may be used as a source of a byte-stream for debugging TCP network code for proper bounds checking and buffer management. It may also be a source of generic payload for bandwidth measurement and/or QoS fine-tuning. Although consideration must be given if hardware compression is active, as the output from the CHARGEN service is easily and efficiently compressed. This compression can cause bandwidth tests to report the size of the data \"after\" decompression, instead of the actual amount of data which passed the wire.\n\nA typical CHARGEN service session looks like this: The user connects to the host using a telnet client.\nThe user receives a stream of bytes. Although the specific format of the output is not prescribed by , the recommended pattern (and a de facto standard) is shifted lines of 72 ASCII characters repeating.\n\nThis continues until the TCP connection is closed as shown in the trace by ending the telnet session.\n\nThe service was used maliciously to crash Microsoft domain name servers (DNS) running Windows NT 4.0 by piping the arbitrary characters straight into the DNS server listening port (telnet ntbox 19 | telnet ntbox 53). However, the attack may have been a symptom of improper buffer management on the part of Microsoft's DNS service and not directly related to the CHARGEN service.\n\nUDP CHARGEN is commonly used in denial-of-service attacks. By using a fake source address the attacker can send bounce traffic off a UDP CHARGEN application to the victim. UDP CHARGEN sends 200 to 1,000 times more data than it receives, depending upon the implementation. This \"traffic multiplication\" is also attractive to an attacker because it obscures the attacker's IP address from the victim.\n\nCHARGEN was widely implemented on network-connected printers. As printer firmware was rarely updated on older models before CHARGEN and other security concerns were known, there may still be many network-connected printers which implement the protocol. Where these are visible to the Internet, they are invariably misused as denial of service vectors. Potential attackers often scan networks looking for UDP port 19 CHARGEN sources.\n\nSo notorious is the availability of CHARGEN in printers that some distributed denial of service trojans now use UDP port 19 for their attack traffic. The supposed aim is to throw investigators off the track; to have them looking for old printers rather than subverted computers.\n\n"}
{"id": "2099977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099977", "title": "Alistair Smythe", "text": "Alistair Smythe\n\nAlistair Smythe () is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He was one of Spider-Man's enemies and the son of Spencer Smythe. Although he used a wheelchair at one point, he later gained the ability to walk after transforming himself into what he called the Ultimate Spider-Slayer.\n\nAlistair Smythe first appeared in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" Annual 19 (November 1985), created by Louise Simonson and Mary Wilshire. Alistair Smythe died in \"The Superior Spider-Man\" #13 (September 2013).\n\nThe Spider-Slayers were a series of robots that sought to destroy Spider-Man. The initial generation of Spider-Slayers were created by his father Spencer Smythe. After Spencer failed to kill Spider-Man—and ended up dying as a result of prolonged exposure to the radioactive samples involved—Alistair inherited his father's legacy and gained a new-found hatred toward Spider-Man. His initial attempt, however, failed when, in a rather humorous misunderstanding, he mistook Mary Jane Watson for Spider-Man; playing along with it to give Peter Parker time to come up with a plan while Mary Jane used a super-powered suit designed by aliens) until he was defeated by the real wall-crawler. He initially worked for the Kingpin but left in disagreement over how to deal with Spider-Man and went solo.\n\nAfter being confined in an asylum, Alistair released himself and took several other inmates with him in order to construct a new series of Spider-Slayers that tracked Spider-Man across the city. With a plan of revenge, he forced the inmates to assist him in the machines' construction. After sending a series of slayers after Spider-Man (and all of their inevitable destruction with assistance from others including Scorpion and the Black Cat), Alistair lured Spider-Man to his residence for one final battle. In order to defeat Spider-Man on his own, Alistair enhanced himself by encasing his entire body in a bioorganic carapace that not only served as a full body armour, but increased his strength and gave him the ability to walk again by interconnecting with his spine. The physical structure of the carapace gave Alistair bird-like talons for feet; a long, curved blade-like weapon jutting from each shoulder; a pair of smaller, jagged blade weapons on each forearm; and a specially made web-shooter that fires from the forearm area. Eventually, Spider-Man defeated Alistair and made sure he'd been taken to custody as well as the other asylum inmates who survived the ordeal.\n\nDuring Scarlet Spider's brief stint as sole web-slinger in town, Smythe (still carapaced as the Ultimate Spider-Slayer) started a war utilizing a new set of slayers he intended to sell on the black market. These Cyber-Slayers, which could be controlled remotely by turning one's thoughts into the slayers' actions, were initially targeted at Lady Octopus and her crew. The Scarlet Spider ended up in the middle of things and temporarily allied with the Cyber-Slayers, a fact that did not go over well with Smythe.\n\nSmythe, no longer in his carapace but with his ability to walk restored by his earlier use of it, found his way outside prison and sought revenge on both Spider-Man and J. Jonah Jameson for the death of his father. He coerced Jameson to alter the stories in the Daily Bugle or else he'd kill JJJ's wife and son John Jameson. Once Spider-Man caught on to Smythe's trail, he followed it back to the Bugle where Smythe assaulted him with recreated versions of every spider-slayer ever sent after Spider-Man in the past plus a pair of new creations—a miniature model designed to latch onto Spider-Man's face and penetrate his mind through use of radiation and a larger six-armed model arguably stronger than any other created. While attached to Spider-Man's head, the miniature spider-slayer psionically connected to Spidey's mind, copied thoughts of his loved ones, and broadcast that information to all the other mini-slayers. Smythe gave Spider-Man the choice of either stopping them or preventing the six-armed slayer from destroying Jameson. Spider-Man eventually shut down all the spider-slayers at the same time, but it was Jameson who beat Smythe to the verge of death with a baseball bat for threatening his family. Smythe made another return in which he used a poisonous spider he made and attacked John Jameson and caused him to end up in the hospital.\n\nDuring the \"\" storyline, Alistair Smythe returns with a new metallic body armor and is hunting down all of J. Jonah Jameson's friends and families. He decides to seek out Mac Gargan for help, who is currently locked away in jail. Posing as a scientist, Smythe infiltrates the Raft and makes off with Gargan. He then performs a cybernetic operation on him, turning him into a cyborg Scorpion, and convinces him to join his crusade against Jameson. At this point, Smythe has amassed a small army of cyborg minions, all of whom want revenge on Jameson. Smythe, Scorpion, and a new villain named Fly-Girl lead their army to attack the site of John Jameson's latest space mission, sabotaging the launch and holding John for ransom. Smythe's new plan was to kill all those close to Jameson, but not to kill Jameson himself so Jameson could feel the same suffering that he did losing his father. Smythe's actions get Jameson's wife Dr. Marla Jameson killed, as well as seemingly permanently negating Spider-Man's spider-sense when a device Spider-Man designed to overload a link between Smythe's current Slayers also damaged his spider-sense. J. Jonah Jameson plans to have the death penalty given to Alistair Smythe for what happened to Marla.\n\nDuring the \"Spider-Island\" storyline, J. Jonah Jameson brings Alistair Smythe from Ryker's Island to demand his help in resolving the spider-flu plague transforming ordinary citizens into Homo Archanis. Alistair Smythe laughed at the irony of how Jameson has gained spider powers. At the moment, Jameson transforms and seriously wounds Smythe by biting a chunk out of his neck.\n\nDespite his injuries, Alistair Smythe is seen alive and well as a prisoner in the Raft. Alistair Smythe is a witness of the escape of Doctor Octopus (who has swapped his mind with Spider-Man) and was denied to join up with him.\n\nMayor J. Jonah Jameson calls in Superior Spider-Man to help oversee the execution of Alistair Smythe so that he would not escape. Superior Spider-Man confronts Smythe, who tries to taunt him by mentioning Marla Jameson's death. Since Smythe is unaware of the mindswap and that Otto was not paying attention due to him remembering his time locked up during his final days as Doctor Octopus, Superior Spider-Man brushes him off. Mayor Jameson alongside Superior Spider-Man, his assistant Glory Grant, and Bugle reporter Norah Jones watch the procedure of Smythe's execution while he claims to be a \"better person\". Superior Spider-Man tries to reply that no one would buy that, only to stop himself once he remembers that he just pulled that trick. Just as Smythe's execution begins, a swarm of mini Spider-Slayers attack the place allowing Smythe to move freely. However, they are counteracted by Otto's Spider-Bots. Smythe attempts to escape, but he finds out that Otto has prepared himself for every method of escape he may try, prompting Smythe to shift his plan to kill Spider-Man for which he was also prepared. The mini Spider-Slayers enter the infirmary where they surround Boomerang, Vulture, and Scorpion. The mini Spider-Slayers heal and enhance them where they get one request from Smythe to kill Superior Spider-Man.\n\nSuperior Spider-Man is seen fighting Smythe and is mocking him for being weak in comparison to his father Spencer Smythe. When Superior Spider-Man says that he has called the Avengers for backup, Smythe states that he has his own backup as Boomerang, Scorpion, and Vulture show up. Superior Spider-Man admits that the Mini-Slayers were clever but inadvertently reveals that his countermeasures are being powered by the Raft's Power Generators distracting him at the revelation. Smythe takes the upper hand until he is narrowly shot down by Mayor Jameson disguised as a Raft guard. Superior Spider-Man hunts Smythe through his comm system only to discover that he did the same trick and informed his allies (all heading for a full front assault against Superior Spider-Man) who tries to convince them that Smythe is using them and will take back their enhancements once he has out. All of them agree that even though that might happen, they will make the best of the situation against him. Smythe manages to reach the Raft's generators, destroying them to shut down the power in the entire island, allowing the Lizard to escape. Once Smythe tries to escape, Superior Spider-Man reminds him about the emergency generators. Smythe warns Superior Spider-Man that just like he does with his Spider-Bots, he can see through his Mini-Slayers catching up on Mayor Jameson and the trapped civilians sending their locations to the group. Scorpion rejects it at first, but is easily convinced once Smythe tells him that one of his targets is Mayor Jameson himself. After Boomerang is defeated, Smythe warns Superior Spider-Man that he is still caught in a predicament since Scorpion is heading to his personal vengeance against Jameson and Vulture is ready to kill the group of civilians so he must make a choice only to be surprised when Superior Spider-Man replies that he will not follow any of them. Instead, Superior Spider-Man determined to complete his mission of slaying him.\n\nSuperior Spider-Man succeeds in killing Smythe but only physically his corpse, with his mind intact, attacks the survivors, disarming the guards. Superior Spider-Man tackles Smythe and they fall onto the shore below, Smythe attempts to transfer his mind into Superior Spider-Man, however, Superior Spider-Man had already done this and equipped the mask with armored plating. Before Alistair dies, Superior Spider-Man taunts him by revealing being Otto and that Otto already beat the true Spider-Man to the mind transfer. His body is presumably carried away.\n\nDuring the \"\" storyline, Doctor Octopus' conscious in an Octobot infiltrates New U Technologies and finds that the Jackal has obtained the body of Alistair. Jackal managed to make a clone of Alistair alongside his father.\n\nAlistair Smythe is a scientific genius specializing in robotics, cybernetics and genetics. His most notable inventions are the Spider-Slayers, robots built for the express purpose of capturing or killing Spiderman. Though the creation and idea for these originally came from his father, Alistair has made advances and improvements on the originals and current generations are extremely sophisticated and formidable. The Spider-Slayers often operate in groups and Alistair is tactically skilled in his deployment of them. Smythe invented a bio-organic carapace that serves as a full body armor. It gives him increased strength and the ability to walk again by interfacing with his spine. The carapace has bird-like talons for feet, a long, curved bladed weapon jutting from each shoulder and smaller, jagged blades on each forearm. It also has web-shooter that fires from the forearm area. While wearing this armor, Smythe has superhuman strength, durability, speed and agility.\n\nIn the \"House of M\" reality, a furious J. Jonah Jameson hired Alistair Smythe, an associate of Norman Osborn, to build a Spider-Slayer to get revenge against the Parkers.\n\n\nAlistair Smythe appears in \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\", portrayed by B.J. Novak. An insulting supervisor at Oscorp, he orders Max Dillon to check the electrical fault on his subordinate's birthday which causes the man's transformation into Electro.\n\n"}

His father, Hryhoriy Timofiyovych Tychynin, was a village deacon and a teacher in the local grammar school. His mother, Maria Vasylivna Tychynina (Savytska), was eleven years younger than Pavlo's father. Pavlo had nine siblings: five sisters and four brothers. At first young Tychyna studied at the district's elementary school which was opened in Pisky in 1897. His first teacher was Serafima Morachevska who later recommended him to try his talent in chorus. In 1900 he became a member of an archiary chorus in the Trinity (Troitsky) monastery near Chernihiv. Simultaneously young Tychyna studied in the Chernihiv theological school. In 1906 Pavlo's father died. In 1907 Pavlo finished his school.\n\nIn 1907-1913 Tychyna continued his education in the Chernihiv Theological Seminary. There he became friends with the future poet, Vasyl Ellan-Blakytny. He also met Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky who greatly influenced his early works. In 1912-1913 Tychyna's works get published in the various local publications. In 1913-1917 he was studying at the Economics department of the Kiev Commercial Institute which he did not finish. At the same time, he worked on the editorial boards of the Kiev newspaper Rada and the magazine Svitlo (1913–14). In summers he worked for the Chernihiv statistical bureau. Later he worked as the assistant to chorus-meister in the Mykola Sadovsky theater.\n\nWhen World War I broke out the institute transferred to Saratov. Tychyna, whilst on the road to the institute's new location, became ill and was forced to stop and recover from his sickness. He found sanctuary at the house of another poet, Volodymyr Samiylenko, in Dobrianka. During the war he worked with various Ukrainian publications. In 1920 Pavlo became a member of Pluh. After an immediate success with his poetry, in 1923 he moved to Kharkiv (Kharkov), entering the vibrant world of early post-Revolution Ukrainian literary organizations. In 1923 he joined the organization Hart after moving to Kharkivn and in 1927 the famed VAPLITE. In the 1920s Tychyna was a member of Kharkiv city council as an independent. Controversy about the ideological tendencies of VAPLITE and the content of several of Tychnya's poems led to him being criticized for ideological reasons. As a response, Tychyna stopped writing and everybody assumed that it was the end to his writings. Later he became a member of Chervonyi Shliakh, and started to study Armenian, Georgian, and Turkic language, and became the activist of the Association of Eastern Studies in Kiev.\n\nHis initial work had strong connections to the symbolist literary movement, but his style transformed a number of times during his long career and frequently aped the acceptable socialist realism. His first works exploded onto the avant-garde Ukrainian scene with their colorful imagery and dynamic rhythms. However, as the Communist approach to artistic expression hardened and the role of a state-supported artist became more defined and restricted, Tychyna's poetry shifted rather dramatically, using clear pro-Communist political language, including a famous ode to Joseph Stalin, and the lyrics of the state anthem of the Ukrainian SSR. In 1933 the newspaper \"Pravda\" published his poem \"The Party leads\" in the Ukrainian language. Tychyna was often criticized by Ukrainian exiles for the praising of Communism in his work and co-option by the regime, but recent scholarship has stressed his subtle distancing and mocking of Communist excesses and brutality through over-the-top suffusive praise.\n\nTychyna represents a complicated figure in both a political and academic sense. Many Ukrainian exile intellectuals and scholars involved in the analysis of Ukrainian literary history could not accept Tychnya's submission to political authority and apparent abandonment of many of his literary companions to the horrors of Stalinism. The true merit of his later poetry has been difficult to judge in such a bitter environment, which is only now relaxing. It also becomes difficult to determine Tychyna's true intent and emotions in such a repressive environment.\n\nTychnya's willingness to work with authorities, however, did not prevent Soviet authorities from forcing him to write a letter rejecting his candidature for a Nobel Prize, likely due to his Ukrainian heritage.\n\n\nThe poems of Pavlo Tychyna were translated into English by Stephen Komarnyckyj.\n\n\n\n"}

All of the members had previous experience as session musicians. Thiers decided on the name of the band after visiting an Indian restaurant in London together with German-Israeli artist Moti Argaman, where they had the \"special\" (extra spicy) dish of the house.\n\nIt was not until 1985 that the band became successful. Although their first single, \"Stop! Girls Go Crazy\", did not chart, the follow-up, \"Cold Days, Hot Nights\", was a major hit in Europe, reaching number 3 in Germany. The third single \"Don't Be So Shy\" made it to number 9. The band's first album, \"Motivation\", reached number 20 on the charts in that same year.\n\nMichael Cretu left the band to pursue his solo career, and production work with various artists, including his wife, 80s superstar sensation Sandra.\n\nNothing was heard of from the band again until 1989, when a new single, In Love We Stand, was released. The album, along with its title-track, \"Dancing For Victory\" were not that well-received as the first album was. Two new members had also been added: Frank Adahl – vocals/keyboards and Anders Mossberg – basses. They were both session-musicians from Sweden. By then, Tuxen and Tarrach were the only original members still in the band.\n\nMichael Cretu has since had a successful career, as a solo artist, collaborator, writer, producer, and most notably, as the creator of Enigma. He also recorded an album with Manfred Thiers as Cretu & Thiers. Their album \"Belle Epoque\" was released in 1988.\n\nManfred Thiers is still working as a session bass player, and in 2005 performed on the album \"The Voice of Leonard Bernstein\", alongside Leonard Bernstein, José Carreras, and Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, as well as many other great performers. More importantly, he is also a member of Schiller-live Band (Weltreise/Voyage, Leben/Life and Tag und Nacht/Night and Day live tour). \n\nIn 2006, official remixes of \"Cold Days, Hot Nights\" (by DJ/producer Arnold Palmer) took the track, now re-titled simply as \"Cold Days\", into the Top 5 of the Official German Dance Charts.

The Turduli who lived mainly in the south and centre of modern Portugal – in the east of the provinces of Beira Litoral, coastal Estremadura and Alentejo along the Guadiana valley, and in Extremadura and Andalusia in Spain.\n\nTheir capital was the old oppidum of \"Ibolca\" (sometimes transliterated as \"Ipolka\"), known as Obulco in Roman times, and which currently corresponds to the city of Porcuna, currently located between the provinces of Córdoba and Jaén.\n\nApart from \"Ibolca\", the pre-Roman towns most strongly associated with the Turdulli include \"Budua\" (Badajoz), \"Dipo\" (Guadajira), \"Mirobriga\" (Capilla), and \"Sisapo\" (Almadén).\n\nWhile they are sometimes described, in the available ancient sources, as being related ethnically to the neighboring Turdetani of Baetica (modern Andalusia), the exact ethnic origins remain obscure.The only evidence regarding the original Turdulian language are a few funerary inscriptions. Linguistic studies of these texts suggest that the early Turduli spoke an Indo-European language. Some scholars have put forward evidence that the language belonged to the Anatolian branch of Indo-European and was similar, in particular, to Paeonian-Mysian. There may also have been cultural links to the Ligurians and Illyrians (who were native to the western Balkans). However, the Turduli were later generally regarded as Celts, suggesting that they were significantly influenced by neighboring tribes like the Celtici.\n\nAccording to the 4th century BC Greek geographer and explorer Pytheas, quoted by Strabo in the 1st century AD, their ancestral homeland was located north of Turdetania (the region where was located the semi-legendary Kingdom of Tartessos, in the Baetis River valley, the present-day Guadalquivir), in the modern Spanish eastern Extremadura region, where their ancient capital \"Regina Tourdulorum\" (Reina – Badajoz) once stood.\n\nThe collapse of Tartessos in around 530 BC, and migrations by the Celtici in the 6th-5th centuries BC appear to have also caused mass migrations by the Turduli. The majority settled the middle \"Anas\" (Guadiana) basin, a region known as \"Beturia\" or \"Baeturia Turdulorum\" roughly corresponding to parts of eastern Alentejo, and the western half of the modern Badajoz and southeastern Huelva provinces, hence the name Baetici Turduli. Others went west, colonizing the central coastal Portuguese region of Estremadura and became known as Turduli Oppidani. Some went south, where they settled the present Setubal peninsula along the Tagus river mouth and the lower \"Sardum\" (Sado; \"Kallipos\" in the Greek sources) river valley as the Bardili. The remnants, designated Turduli Veteres in the ancient sources, migrated northwards in conjunction with the Celtici and ended settling the Beira Litoral, a coastal region situated along the lower Douro and \"Vacca\" (Vouga) river basins.\n\n\n\n"}

Since 1906, it has been used as a garden ornament in the garden of Buckingham Palace, London.\n\nEmperor Napoleon I of France, passing through Tuscany on his journey to the Russian front, was shown a single massive block of marble; he asked for it to be preserved. It is thought that Napoleon may have ordered it to be roughly hewn into the present urn shape, leaving the panels undecorated in readiness to commemorate his expected victories.\n\nFollowing the French defeat in the Napoleonic Wars, the vase was presented unfinished to the Prince Regent in 1815 by Ferdinand, Grand Duke of Tuscany, via the British ambassador, Lord Burghersh. The Prince Regent, soon to become George IV, had the vase completed by the sculptor Richard Westmacott with the intention that it be the focal point of the new Waterloo chamber at Windsor Castle, commemorating the Battle of Waterloo, one of numerous triumphal commissions for Westmacott after Waterloo. \n\nInspired by Ancient Roman models, such as the Borghese Vase and the Medici Vase, the Waterloo Vase was carved with bas-reliefs of George III (long removed from public view) on his throne, Napoleon unhorsed, and various allegorical figures. Two winged busts of angels leap incongruously from the sides of the vase, resembling more the figureheads of an ancient ship than the handles of an elegant marble vase. \n\nVarious sources give differing descriptions of the vase's weight, with the 1968 book \"Buckingham Palace and its treasures\" stating a weight of twenty tons. No floor could bear the weight of the vase, so it was presented to the National Gallery in 1836. The Gallery finally returned the white elephant to the sovereign in 1906, and Edward VII had the vase placed outside in the garden at Buckingham Palace where it now remains standing some distance from the palace in a wooded area to the northwest of the main building, on an austere brick paved plinth, the marble showing signs of severe erosion from atmospheric pollution.\n\n"}

Alongside the Celtici, the Turduli Veteres migrated northwards around the 5th century BC, before settling in a coastal region situated along the lower Douro and \"Vacca\" (Vouga) river basins (i.e. north-western parts of present-day Beira Litoral).\n\nUnlike related and neighbouring peoples, the Turduli Veteres did not fall under Carthaginian rule during the later 3rd Century BC. Neither is there any evidence that they took part in the 2nd Punic War. It is still not clear if they played any significant role in the Lusitanian Wars of the 2nd century BC. Moreover, the Turduli Veteres, unlike the Turduli Oppidani (located in coastal areas of modern Portugal), appear to have remained independent until the late 2nd century BC and to have resisted attempts to incorporate them into federations, by the Lusitani and Gallaeci.\n\nBeing relatively unaccustomed to interaction with and dominance by other peoples, the Turduli Veteres (like the Lusitani and Gallaeci), bore the brunt of the first Roman forays into north-west Iberia. According to Roman accounts, the Veteres assisted the Lusitani in attempting to resist the Romans; in retaliation, during 138-136 BC, the Roman \"Consul\" Decimus Junius Brutus temporarily occupied the Veteres' stronghold of Talabriga and laid waste a significant proportion of the Veteres' lands. In 61-60 BC, the Veteres and the Oppidani were defeated and incorporated into Hispania Ulterior province by the \"Propraetor\" Julius Caesar. In 27–13, the Veteres were aggregated into the Roman province of Lusitania (during the reign of Emperor Augustus).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2100022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100022", "title": "Dorothy West", "text": "Dorothy West\n\nDorothy West (June 2, 1907 – August 16, 1998) was an American novelist and short story writer during the time of the Harlem Renaissance. She is best known for her novel \"The Living Is Easy\", as well as many other short stories and essays, about the life of an upper-class black family.\n\nDorothy West was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on June 2, 1907, to Virginian Isaac Christopher West, who was formerly enslaved and later became a successful businessman, and Rachel Pease Benson of Camden, South Carolina, one of 22 children. The poet Helene Johnson was her cousin. West reportedly wrote her first story at the age of seven. Her first short story, \"Promise and Fulfillment\", was published in the \"Boston Post\" when she was 14 years old, and she won several local writing competitions. West attended Girls' Latin school, now called Boston Latin Academy, graduating at 16, and went on to Boston University and the Columbia University School of Journalism.\n\nIn 1926, she tied for second place in a writing contest sponsored by \"\", a journal published by the National Urban League, with her short story \"The Typewriter\". The person West tied with was future novelist Zora Neale Hurston.\n\nBetween 1928 and 1930, some of West's other early writings were published in the \"Saturday Evening Quill\", a short-lived annual literary magazine that grew out of a literary club of the same name, of which West was a founding member.\n\nShortly before winning the \"Opportunity\" writing contest, West moved to Harlem with her cousin, the poet Helene Johnson. There West met other writers of the Harlem Renaissance, including Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, and the novelist Wallace Thurman. West was quoted as saying in 1995: \"We didn't know it was the Harlem Renaissance, because we were all young and all poor.\" Hughes gave West the nickname of \"The Kid\", by which she was known during her time in Harlem, and she was among a group of African Americans who traveled with him on a trip to Russia in 1932 for a film about American race relations. The film never came to fruition, though she and Hughes remained in Russia for a year. Her 1985 essay \"An Adventure in Moscow\" (published in the \"Vineyard Gazette\") records an encounter with the film director Sergei Eisenstein.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, West's principal contribution to the Harlem Renaissance was to publish the magazine \"Challenge\", which she founded with $40 in 1934, the final issue being published in spring 1937. She also published the magazine's radical though shortlived successor, \"New Challenge\", which published Richard Wright's groundbreaking essay \"Blueprint for Negro Writing\", together with writings by Margaret Walker and Ralph Ellison, but closed after one issue.\n\nIn her later years West had become aware that, up until the Harlem Renaissance, it was almost impossible for a black woman to sustain a career in writing. She was in fact one of the first black female writers to have her works published. This later served as a permanent reminder that African-American women were not always recognized. West had explained in an interview that, due to the publishers' lack of interest, the audience never had a chance to be present. She also attributed her spark of inspiration, to her aunt's subscription to the NAACP's magazine \"Crisis\". Two years before she died, West won an Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for Lifetime Achievement.\n\nAfter both magazines folded because of insufficient financing, West worked for the Works Progress Administration's Federal Writers' Project until the mid-1940s. During this time she wrote a number of short stories for the \"New York Daily News\", where she was the first black writer published. She then moved to Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard, where she wrote her first novel, \"The Living Is Easy\". Featuring an ironic sense of humor unique to West's style, the story chronicles the life of a young southern girl in pursuit of the upper class lifestyle. Published in 1948, the novel was well received critically but did not sell many copies.\n\nIn the subsequent four decades, West worked as a journalist, primarily writing for a small newspaper on Martha's Vineyard. In 1948, she started a weekly column about Oak Bluffs people, events, and nature. In 1982 The Feminist Press brought \"The Living Is Easy\" back into print, giving new attention to West and her role in the Harlem Renaissance; she was included in the 1992 anthology \"Daughters of Africa\" (ed. Margaret Busby). As a result of this renewed attention, at the age of 85 West finally finished a second novel, entitled \"The Wedding\", which portrayed the message that while race may be a false distinction, love knows no bounds. Published to acclaim in 1995 — the \"Publishers Weekly\" review stated: \"West's first novel in 45 years is a triumph.\" — the novel was a best-seller and resulted in the publication of a collection of West's short stories and reminiscences called \"The Richer, the Poorer\". Oprah Winfrey turned the novel into a 1998 two-part television miniseries, \"The Wedding\".\n\nWest died on August 16, 1998, at the age of 91, at the New England Medical Center in Boston. Though her cause of death was never officially released, it is suspected that she died of natural causes. At her death, she was one of the last surviving members of the Harlem Renaissance. When asked what she wanted her legacy to be, she responded with \"That I hung in there. That I didn't say I can't.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2100026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100026", "title": "Mimizan", "text": "Mimizan\n\nMimizan is a commune in the Landes department in Nouvelle-Aquitaine in south-western France. There are two separate districts of the town: Mimizan-Bourg (town center) and Mimizan-Plage (resort).\n\nMimizan is a seaside resort on the Atlantic Ocean in southwestern France.\n\nThis Mimizanaise resort was divided in two by the current: Mimizan North Beach where the majority of summer activities take place, the seasonal markets, the pedestrian street and Mimizan South Beach with cycling paths and walking trails make it an exceptional holiday location.\nThe stretches of fine sand of the Mimizan Beach acquired the nickname the \"Pearl of the Silver Coast\" when the poet Maurice Martin made a stop with his caravan in 1905. Mimizan Beach has also witnessed major events such as the emergency landing of the \"Canary Bird\", also commonly referred to as the \"Yellow Bird\", out of fuel on the Plage-des-Ailes on 16 June 1929. Coming from Old Orchard (the United States), on the occasion of France's first Atlantic crossing by plane (see Alcock and Brown, 1919, for the first transatlantic flight), the young flamboyant crew included Jean Assolant, René LeFevre, Armand Lotti, and a stowaway named Arthur Schreiber, whose extra weight was the reason for the fuel shortage.\n\nComing out of Aureilhan lake, Mimizan Current that is 7 km long is also the spillway for the three lakes in the North of Landes (Cazeaux-Sanguinet, Parentis-Biscarosse and Aureilhan-Mimizan). A natural boundary, it marks out the north and south areas of the district.\nIts history is like the meanders of its course. In 1812, it flowed into the ocean at 3.5 km more in the south (a locality named Maillouyère). In 1928, a strong current of water destroyed the littoral dune on the origin mouth. Two dikes built by man dictate its course today. But sea erosion does not always suit the infrastructures and the current is still subject to close monitoring.\nAt the edge of Courant, enthusiasts meet throughout the year to partake in the age-old, and strictly regulated, sport of elver fishing.\nDuring the summer months children can also learn the delights of rod fishing; lessons can be arranged at the fishing school near the lake.\n\n\nIn Neolithic times, the countries of the oceanic fringe were populated by people who hunted and fished, leaving archaeological evidence behind. At the end of the Neolithic Age, small groups of farmers began to settle.\nDuring the first Iron Age (7th to 5th c. BC), small tribes who can be considered as proto-Celts, settled in the area. The presence of a civilization called the Boïens installed in the Buch countryside and who moved down to Born country have also been recorded. However, these small tribes were not deeply implanted in the Lande. When the Romans invaded the Aquitaine, they discovered tribes quite distinct from these Celtic tribes, more like the Iberians, organized in ethnic groups known under the name of the Novempopulania.\n\nAt the end of the third century the region under Rome’s rule organized itself into one province: Aquitania Tertia. It would be lined with roads listed in the Antonine Itinerary, which in the early fourth century retraced the Roman routes, symbols of an economic opening, e.g., the \"coastal\" path and the railway station of Segosa (Saint-Paul-le-Vieux). In Born and Marensin, the bays which had not yet been closed off by dunes obviously served as ports that permitted trade and commerce, such as that of resin collected in the ancient dune forests.\n\nThe period of barbarian invasion was subject to controversy because several legends took birth there (like at Mimizan that at the battle where St. Galatoire perished under the assault of invaders). However, it was unquestionably after the Roman era the invasion of sand forming modern dunes saw the closure of bays and then the ruin of little ports. Among the people that we meet between the 5th and 10th centuries are the Gascons. In 602 the name Vasconia appeared for the first time, to describe the countryside situated between Garonne and the Pyrenees. The Carolingian influence transformed Vasconia into Gascogne. Next the country was to face the Norman invasions.\n\n\nThe Aquitaine duchy sprawling out from the Loire to the Pyrenees was constructed in the 11th century. It was also from this time on, and for seven centuries, that the pilgrimage to saint Jacques de Compostelle began. Pilgrims came from all over Europe crossing the Landes. They followed itineraries that outlined resting stops, places of worship, castles or mottes surrounded by stakes. They used three routes including that of the coast. A number of commandaries or hospitals erected by the Templars or the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem (e.g., Contis, Saint-Paul-en-Born, Parentis, etc.) were regrouped on this coast road. Mimizan was created as a Sauveté (a sacred refuge created by the church for the protection of the weak).\nIts limits were set by nine monumental posts (safety posts) in the form of pyramids. Today, only five still exist and are classified as historical monuments. If the first mention of \"salvitas\" (\"sauvetat\") did not appear until 1270, the term \"frangitas\" was employed during 1009–1032.\nIn 1154, the Aquitaine Duchy entered into the Kingdom of England by the marriage of Alinéor (Eleanor) of Aquitaine with Henri II Plantagenêt, and remained so up to 1453. Born was part of the diocese of Bordeaux. The large Albret family played on the rivalry between the King of France and the King-Duke. They came from the heart of the Landais countryside and carried the modest title of \"senhor\" of Labrit up to 1312, then through purchases, marriages, and inheritances went on to settle in Marensin and Born and then Bazadais. In writings the name of another family who would go on to mark history also appears: Foix-Béarn.\n\n\nAfter 1890, the construction of railway tracks opened up the country. The forges closed down one by one but sawmills and distilleries of resin products multiplied.\nThe renewal of Landes, desired by the Emperor Napoleon III, the arrival of the trains of the Mediterranean Railway Companies (from 1907 up to 1960), the trend of bathing in the sea inspired by the Empress Eugenie and the benefits of the sea air on the health of those with tuberculosis all aided in the rapid expansion of the seaside resort of Mimizan-Plage (first called Mimizan-les-Bains). The town is graced with a sea-bathing establishment constructed out of wood. This drew a number of tourists and contributed to the fame of Mimizan.\nOne of the events to mark this period was the passage of a caravan named by the journalist and writer Maurice Martin and driven by Maurice Vignau and Alphonse Bacon. It traveled around Landes from Arcachon to trace a route for automobiles toward Biarritz. Maurice Martin was in awe of the beauty of the countryside (sky, ocean, forest) and would during a banquet on 20 March 1905 baptize the place \"La Côte d’Argent\" (The Silver Coast).\n\nChâteau Woolsack, \"A Royal Shrine at the Edge of the Lake\"\nIn 1911 Hughes Richard Arthur Grosvenor, Duke of Westminster, had this sublime building erected as a royal reward in recognition of his bravery during the Boer War. Designed by architects Detmar Blow and Fernand Billerey, Woolsack Castle welcomed numerous famous people during the interwar period. For 10 years Coco Chanel came here to relax, sometimes in the company of the seamstresses of her workshop to whom she offered this dream holiday in a villa situated at Mimizan-Plage (now Pylone holiday camp): paid holiday before its time! Charlie Chaplin, Salvador Dalí, Suzanne Leglen all came in their time to profit from this jewel of Victorian architecture. Winston Churchill, a close friend of the Duke’s, even painted some 20 paintings on the banks of Lake Aureilhan. After its purchase by the Gascogne Group, the Woolsack Castle is today privately owned.\n\nThe largest cultivated forest in Europe was imagined by man who fought with a hostile insanitary territory made up of invasive sands, marshes, dried-up moors, where the fragile balance of an agro-sylvo-pastoral economy subsisted. The dunes became stable thanks to local plant species. By his ingenuity, man dried out the marshes and planted thousands of acres of maritime pines.\nProfiting from an embargo by the United States during its Civil War, harvesting resin really took off in France, and this right up to the 19th century. Prices started to fall until a total cease of activity around 1970. The Landais had to adapt, once again, to an economic reconversion, and the production of wood has been the main forest industry since then.\nThe Landes Forest can still be distinguished today by it unique species of \"maritime pine\" and its straight lines the symbol of a rigorous silvicultural exploitation, the most beautiful trees destined for the most modern sawmills (to be turned into beams, wooden houses, floors, paneling, and plywood). Less interesting trees, the by-products of the forest are turned into paper and different types of wood-fiber or particle boards.\nConstantly over 50 percent replanted, this PEFC certified forest (Pan European Forest Certification) is the pledge of sustainable management of the environment.\nThe top local employer, the wood industry generates one job out of three and constitutes the second largest industrial employer in the Aquitaine region. The forest is the source of a multitude of activities and was able to adapt to modern demands.\nCultivated and 94% privately owned, this young and fragile ecosystem is nonetheless open to the public through an immense network of cycling paths, walking trails, guided tours for all ages and fun activities for children.\n\nThe Landes has a history as dense as the dunes which make it so special. The combined effect of the winds and marine regression is at the origin of these \"sand mountains\" obstructing river estuaries, to slowly but surely create a number Landais lakes and ponds.\nAureilhan-Mimizan Lake, Bias pond, Mailloueyre ponds and surroundings, all assemble different types of environments : dunes, waterways, rivers, marshlands and forests.\nThese environments are ideal for the observation of flora and fauna by the relevant competent services and make the ideal location for water and outdoor activities that can be enjoyed all-year round.\nAnd if, on a path detour you come across a hairy bovine, don’t worry, he is working to maintain the pastures that welcome tired and hungry birds from their migratory trip.\n\nIn the microclimate of coastal Aquitaine you will find characteristic flora that can be discovered randomly along paths and trails. Coastal dunes on the edge of Lande, broom, gorse, heather, oak (green or cork) line the landscape. For food lovers, the walk transforms into a hunt for wild strawberries, blackberries, or delicious mushrooms (chanterelles, pine mushrooms).\nTo find just as astonishing specimens head towards Saint-Paul-en-Born. In this small flowery village by the side of the forest, you will find centuries old majestic trees as well as numerous overhanging forest trees. These natural wonders cover all the rivers running through the town.\nFauna includes deer, roe deer, foxes, badgers, martens, hedgehogs, squirrels, wild boar, hares and rabbits. If you lift your eyes to the sky you might see birds flying such as chickadees, cuckoos, finches, owls and other nesting birds whose nests can be found in the branches of pine trees. At certain moments during the year you can even witness the amazing scene of migration birds such as wood pigeons, ortolans, ducks, woodcocks and other cocks that have decided to spend winter in the Landais climate.\n\nIn nearly 50 years, the \"Villes et Villages Fleuris\" label has become the symbol of a real social phenomenon. This phenomenon is ever increasing: each year 12,000 communities present their accomplishments at the Floral Towns and Villages competition; 3,258 communes have been awarded, 201 which won either the Quatre Fleurs (Four Flowers) or the Grand Prize.\n\nThe jury takes the following three criteria into consideration : \nFor over 30 years, the Community of Mimizan Communes has been actively involved in improving the quality of the environment.\nMimizan commune obtained its first Fleur in 1981 and its fourth in 1995 rewarding all of daily efforts of the environmental service (16 full-time and five seasonal employees).\nSince 1996, the communes of Pontenx-les-Forges and of Saint-Paul-en-Born are equally committed to improving the living environment of their commune, and are achieving this through regular gardening managed by the relevant services and the participation by the population. This is how the commune of Pontenx-les-Forges obtained a Fleur, in 2002, and Saint-Paul-en-Born obtained 2 Flowers in 2003.\nFinally, for those who take pleasure in rich aromas and colors the appropriately named Floral Promenade reserves an unequaled show. floral paradise, bordering Aureilhan pond is really worth seeing and accessible throughout the year.\n\"L’Île de la Promenade Fleurie\" (The Isle of the Flowery Promenade) is an amazing floral haven, situated in the inlet of the lake joining land via a wooden bridge; it hosts over 300 different varieties of plants.\n\nPaper mill (Groupe Gascogne Co), tourism (seaside resort).\n\nMimizan is twinned with Old Orchard Beach, Maine, United States.\n\nThe bell tower of the old church is on UNESCO's World Heritage List as part of the Sites of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France. The hunting lodge Château de Woolsack was built in 1911 for the British Duke of Westminster (the architect was Detmar Blow).\n\nPioneer aviators Assolant, Lefèvre and Lotti linked Old Orchard Beach (USA) to Mimizan (landing on 16 June 1929) on board the \"Oiseau Canari\".\n\nCouturier Coco Chanel was a frequent holidaymaker at the Château Woolsack.\n\nPopular activities include surfing, fishing, cycling and sunbathing.\n\n\n"}

The photographs of the \"Bade Baba\" statue have been widely used in many publications, calendars and posters.\n\nAcharya Vidyasagar has been the main source of inspiration for the construction and development of the new main temple and some of the recent structures at Kundalpur. He is often referred to as \"Chhote Baba\" in relation to the Bade Baba image.\n\nConstruction of a massive and spacious new Bade Baba temple was initiated in 1999 after consulting architectural and religious experts. The main statue was transferred to the sanctum of the new structure on 15 January 2006. The new temple will be in the classical Nagar style with some elements of the modern Rajasthani architecture. The temple also has a dharamshala equipped with all modern facilities.\n\nThe Bade Baba temple is the oldest temple at Kundalpur. According to an inscription of Vikram Samvat 1757, the temple was re-discovered by Bhattaraka Surendrakirti of Mulasangha-Balatkaragana-Sarasvati Gachchha and was rebuilt from ruins by his disciple, with assistance from Bundela ruler Chhatrasal.\n\nThe statue of Bade Baba (Lord Adinath) was transferred to a new temple under construction on 17 January 2006. The transfer was a dramatic event involving a confrontation between the district administration and the Jain community that was peacefully resolved. The transfer is narrated and eulogized in a poetic and lyrical composition \"Purudev Stavan\" by Aryaka Mridumati Mata\n\nThere is a 24 lines inscription of time of \"Maharaja-dhiraja\" Sri Chhatra Sala dating 1700 AD, the line 4 mentions the name of Mahavira and line 8 mentions terms \"Jina marga\" and \"Jina Dharma\".\n\nThe temples are square blocks with dome roofs and pinnacles dating back to 8th-9th century. The main temple has an image of Neminatha along with an inscription mounted on wall.\n\nThe kundalpur fair takes place in month of march, beginning with yearly gathering of Jains, immediately after Holi and last a fortnight. \n\nNearby cities include Damoh (35 km), Sagar (113 km), Jabalpur (143 km). Nearest railway station is Damoh which is 38 km from Kundalpur bus stand. Nearest airport is Dumna Airport in Jabalpur (150 km).\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1954 by Donald \"Buddy\" LaRosa, along with partners Richard \"Muzzie\" Minella, Mike Soldano and Frank \"Head\" Serraino. Originally called Papa Gino's, LaRosa later bought out his partners, and changed the name to LaRosa's.\n\nIn addition to serving guests in its pizzerias, LaRosa's is also the exclusive pizza served at the Kings Island and Coney Island amusement parks, the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden, Riverbend Music Center, Perfect North Slopes and the Great American Ball Park (home of the Cincinnati Reds).\n\nThe first store opened March 24, 1954, on Boudinot Avenue in the Westwood area of Cincinnati. The family and franchise owners now operate more than 60 pizzerias, with total annual sales of over $130 million. The sales put the company as the 14th largest pizza-chain in the US in 2014.\n\nIn 1991, LaRosa's invested heavily in the implementation and marketing of a single number call distribution center for delivery and carry out orders. Its phone number is prominently featured in advertising. LaRosa's is very popular in Greater Cincinnati, exceeding Domino's, Donatos Pizza, Pizza Hut and Papa John's in consumer reported purchase frequency.\n\nLaRosa's has always been active in the neighborhoods it serves, sponsoring local youth sports programs with their LaRosa's MVP of the Week and Hall of Fame. In the 1990s, the company started the Buddy Card fundraising program – allowing groups and organizations to sell Buddy Cards, offering a free pizza with purchase, and keep a percentage of the money earned.\n\nOn February 27, 2008, Michael Larosa became CEO of LaRosa's, Inc., succeeding T. D. Hughes (CEO, LaRosa's 1990–2007).\n\nThe company began talking about expansions outside of Cincinnati in 2011, aiming to open stores in Columbus, Indianapolis, Lexington, Louisville and Nashville.\n\nIn 2014, the company signed with Boudinot South, LLC to franchise the first LaRosa's in Tennessee. The store opened in Knoxville's Cedar Bluff area.\n\nIn 2015, the company announced plans to open their first Central Kentucky location in Nicholasville to open in 2016.\n\nIn 2017, Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley honored the founder by renaming a part of Elder St. to Buddy LaRosa Way and declaring April 26 to be Buddy LaRosa Day in Cincinnati.\n\nIn March 2018, the company broke ground for the first franchise location in Lexington, Kentucky. The restaurant officially opened in May 2019.\n\nLaRosa's signature pizza is made with a distinctive thick, sweet sauce (a family recipe created by Buddy's Aunt Dena) and topped with provolone cheese. Their menu also includes subs or \"hoagies\" with a variety of fillings and condiments, as well as calzones, salads, and pastas with over 40 Italian items on the menu. At Cincinnati grocery stores, the company has 15 products with their brand name attached – including olive oil, salad dressings, frozen ravioli, and their pizza sauce.\n\n"}

A supposed original printing of the document surfaced in 1985 and was touted as the oldest surviving print in the United States, but it was later revealed to be the work of prominent forger Mark Hofmann.\n\nThe “Oath” was a vow of obedience to the Company's government and a promise not to conspire against it. Previous examples of oaths in England pledged loyalty to the Crown. The absence of references to the King made the “Oath” a uniquely American document. The earliest known version of the “Oath” was handwritten by Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop in 1631. Governor Winthrop stated in his diary that the “Oath” was the “first thing” printed by Stephen Daye in 1638 or 1639. Stephen Daye was an English locksmith who sailed to Boston in 1638 with a Puritan cleric who had smuggled a printing press on board the ship. After the cleric and his printer died at sea, Daye and his sons took possession of the press and set up Cambridge Press, the first printing company in America, in Boston. Before 1638, all printed materials in America were produced in England and shipped across the Atlantic. The earliest known American imprint that had been found prior to 1685 was the Bay Psalm Book, which Daye printed in 1640. Daye's printing of the “Oath” had not been reported as seen since 1647, and according to historian Lawrence C. Wroth, “the probability that one will some day be found has never ceased to excite the New England collector.”\n\nThe break from English monarchy, combined with the document's status as the first document printed in America, conferred a special status on the “Oath.” Thus, the long-anticipated discovery of an original printing of the “Oath” created a fervent reception when a rare-documents dealer named Mark Hofmann claimed to have found a broadside of the “Oath” in a New York bookstore in 1985. In 1985, Hofmann's print of the “Oath” was offered for sale to both the Library of Congress and the American Antiquarian Society, at a reported asking price of $1.5 million. The Library of Congress declared that the discovery “would be one of the most important and exciting finds of the century” and stated that its examination “found nothing inconsistent with a mid-17th century attribution.” The American Antiquarian Society had possession of the document for two months and announced, “as far as we know, there are no anomalies.” Both organizations wanted to undertake further testing of the “Oath” to determine its authenticity and remained interested in acquiring the document despite some troubling events after its discovery. Steven Christensen, a prominent leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and one of Hofmann's customers, had been killed by a pipe bomb left at his office in downtown Salt Lake City in October 1985. A day later, Hofmann was badly injured by a pipe bomb placed in his automobile. Hoffman later pled guilty to the bombings.\n\nHofmann demonstrated considerable skill in the creation of his forgeries. He acquired or stole paper that was manufactured appropriate to the time of the documents he forged. He made his own ink and used chemical processes to age his documents in order to make them look authentic. He learned to hypnotize himself in order to fluidly copy the signatures of historical figures. His forgeries fooled experts in the field, such as Charles Hamilton, Kenneth W. Rendell, and investigators at the National Archives and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. During his confession, Hofmann stated that he did most of his printing from plates that he made himself but “got lazy and had the ‘Oath’ plate made professionally.\" Ultimately, Hofmann's laziness and lack of paper money, which required him to write a $2 check, exposed him as a forger.\n\n"}

{"id": "2100075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100075", "title": "Information revolution", "text": "Information revolution\n\nThe term information revolution describes current economic, social and technological trends beyond the Industrial Revolution. The information revolution was enabled by advances in semiconductor technology, particularly the metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) and the integrated circuit (IC) chip, leading to the Information Age in the early 21st century.\n\nMany competing terms have been proposed that focus on different aspects of this societal development.\nThe British polymath crystallographer J. D. Bernal introduced the term \"\"scientific and technical revolution\"\" in his 1939 book \"The Social Function of Science\" to describe the new role that science and technology are coming to play within society. He asserted that science is becoming a \"productive force\", using the Marxist Theory of Productive Forces. After some controversy, the term was taken up by authors and institutions of the then-Soviet Bloc. Their aim was to show that socialism was a safe home for the scientific and technical (\"technological\" for some authors) revolution, referred to by the acronym STR. The book \"Civilization at the Crossroads\", edited by the Czech philosopher Radovan Richta (1969), became a standard reference for this topic.\n\nDaniel Bell (1980) challenged this theory and advocated post-industrial society, which would lead to a service economy rather than socialism. Many other authors presented their views, including Zbigniew Brzezinski (1976) with his \"Technetronic Society\".\n\nThe main feature of the information revolution is the growing economic, social and technological role of information. Information-related activities did not come up with the Information Revolution. They existed, in one form or the other, in all human societies, and eventually developed into institutions, such as the Platonic Academy, Aristotle's Peripatetic school in the Lyceum, the Musaeum and the Library of Alexandria, or the schools of Babylonian astronomy. The Agricultural Revolution and the Industrial Revolution came up when new informational inputs were produced by individual innovators, or by scientific and technical institutions. During the Information Revolution all these activities are experiencing continuous growth, while other information-oriented activities are emerging.\n\nInformation is the central theme of several new sciences, which emerged in the 1940s, including Shannon's (1949) \"Information Theory\" and Wiener's (1948) \"Cybernetics\". Wiener stated: \"information is information not matter or energy\". This aphorism suggests that information should be considered along with matter and energy as the third constituent part of the Universe; information is carried by matter or by energy. By the 1990s some writers believed that changes implied by the Information revolution will lead to not only a fiscal crisis for governments but also the disintegration of all \"large structures\".\n\nThe term \"information revolution\" may relate to, or contrast with, such widely used terms as Industrial Revolution and Agricultural Revolution. Note, however, that you may prefer mentalist to materialist paradigm. The following fundamental aspects of the theory of information revolution can be given:\n\n\nFrom a different perspective, Irving E. Fang (1997) identified six 'Information Revolutions': writing, printing, mass media, entertainment, the 'tool shed' (which we call 'home' now), and the information highway. In this work the term 'information revolution' is used in a narrow sense, to describe trends in communication media.\n\nPorat (1976) measured the information sector in the US using the input-output analysis; OECD has included statistics on the information sector in the economic reports of its member countries. Veneris (1984, 1990) explored the theoretical, economic and regional aspects of the informational revolution and developed a systems dynamics simulation computer model.\n\nThese works can be seen as following the path originated with the work of Fritz Machlup who in his (1962) book \"The Production and Distribution of Knowledge in the United States\", claimed that the \"knowledge industry represented 29% of the US gross national product\", which he saw as evidence that the Information Age had begun. He defines knowledge as a commodity and attempts to measure the magnitude of the production and distribution of this commodity within a modern economy. Machlup divided information use into three classes: instrumental, intellectual, and pastime knowledge. He identified also five types of knowledge: practical knowledge; intellectual knowledge, that is, general culture and the satisfying of intellectual curiosity; pastime knowledge, that is, knowledge satisfying non-intellectual curiosity or the desire for light entertainment and emotional stimulation; spiritual or religious knowledge; unwanted knowledge, accidentally acquired and aimlessly retained.\n\nMore recent estimates have reached the following results:\n\n\n"}

Nielsen was influential in systematics and Lepidoptera research, and was an early proponent of biodiversity informatics. The journal \"Invertebrate Systematics\" was established with significant contributions from Nielsen and he assisted in the founding of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Nielsen authored several books, published over eighty scientific papers, and was highly regarded within the scientific community. Following his death, the GBIF organised the Ebbe Nielsen Prize in his memory, awarded annually to promising researchers in the field of biodiversity informatics. The moth \"Pollanisus nielseni\" is dedicated to Nielsen.\n\nNielsen was born on 7 June 1950 in Ry, Denmark. His parents were farmers and he and his brother frequently explored the surrounding Jutland countryside, playing in forests and by the shores of Mossø, a lake near their home. Inspired by reading about collecting and identifying moths and butterflies, Nielsen began gathering specimens at the age of fourteen and later joined an entomology club based in Århus.\n\nNielsen attended Aarhus University while working part-time for a local museum. Following graduation, he was solicited to join a project on the ecosystem of Danish beech forests, which the museum had been involved in. With this appointment, Nielsen began his masters research, collecting numerous specimens as part of the project and studying their phenology and distribution, gaining his MSc in zoology in 1976.\n\nFollowing writing a volume on the moth family Elachistidae and working on the checklist of Danish Lepidoptera, Nielsen was invited through the University of Copenhagen to participate in a six-month expedition to South America. The trip commenced in 1978 and focused on extensive biodiversity surveys of the Patagonia region. Nielsen managed much of the expedition and was involved with it for the whole of the period, one of only two of the original fifteen scientists to see the project through to completion. The experience provided him with considerable material for his PhD and he developed an appreciation for the fauna of the southern hemisphere, where he would live for the next two decades.\n\nNielsen acquired his PhD from the University of Copenhagen in 1980. A year later, he was engaged by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) to work in Australia on primitive Lepidoptera and other Lepidoptera inventories. He focused less on pure research after 1990, when he was appointed director of the Australian National Insect Collection in Canberra. He was instrumental in the establishment of CSIRO Publishing in 1996, and in particular the journal \"Invertebrate Taxonomy\" (known as \"Invertebrate Systematics\" since the beginning of 2002). He chaired the editorial committee for the journal and was a frequent contributor.\n\nNielsen enthusiastically advocated for a comprehensive repository of data on species and their characteristics, recognising informatics as a key to understanding and managing biodiversity. During the 1990s, he and other scientists pushed for an extensive global biodiversity resource, designed to utilise up-to-date informatics software and capable of collating data held on various separate databases. In 1999, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development endorsed a proposal for the establishment of 'a global biodiversity information facility', and on 1 March 2001, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility was officially launched. As Australia's Head of Delegation for the GBIF and a founding member, Nielsen was en route to Montreal to attend the first meeting of the governing board when he died of a heart attack.\n\nThe Karl Jordan Medal for lepidopterology was awarded to Nielsen by the Lepidopterist' Society in 1990, and he was later a member of the award committee. That same year he was the recipient of the David Rivett Medal from the Australian Academy of Science, and in 1992 of the Ian Mackerras Medal, awarded to him by the Australian Entomological Society. Nielsen was a member of several committees, societies, and advisory boards, was a Foreign Associate of the United States National Academy of Sciences, and a Foreign Fellow of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters.\n\nAs an author and co-author, Nielsen published eight books and monographs, and as an editor and co-editor, was involved with many more. He was also the author of over eighty other published pieces, mostly research and academic papers. The majority of his publications were on the topics of systematics, Lepidoptera, biological inventories, biodiversity, and informatics.\n\nNielsen died in his sleep of a heart attack on 7 March 2001. He was in California for a conference, while on his way to Montreal from Australia, to attend the inaugural session of the governing board for the newly established GBIF, a project with which he'd been significantly involved. A few days after his death, and during the meeting Nielsen had been due to participate in, the GBIF Ebbe Nielsen Prize was conceived to honour his memory. The annual prize recognized a researcher who had made substantial contributions to biodiversity informatics. In 2015, GBIF revamped the award as an incentive competition, now known as the GBIF Ebbe Nielsen Challenge..\n\nA special issue of \"Invertebrate Systematics\" was published in 2003 as a tribute to Nielsen, and contained articles written by his friends and colleagues about him and his work. In 1995, a new species of moth was discovered in Western Australia and in 2005 it was formally described by Gerhard M. Tarmann. The moth, of the genus \"Pollanisus\", was given the specific epithet \"nielseni\" by Tarmann, in memory of his colleague's extensive work in lepidopterology.\n"}

It had its origins in the Industrial Revolution in Britain, where industrial production in large factories transformed working life. At that time, the working day could range from 10 to 16 hours, the work week was typically six days a week and the use of child labour was common. Robert Owen had raised the demand for a ten-hour day in 1810, and instituted it in his socialist enterprise at New Lanark. By 1817 he had formulated the goal of the eight-hour day and coined the slogan: \"Eight hours' labour, Eight hours' recreation, Eight hours' rest\". Women and children in England were granted the ten-hour day in 1847. French workers won the 12-hour day after the February Revolution of 1848. A shorter working day and improved working conditions were part of the general protests and agitation for Chartist reforms and the early organisation of trade unions.\n\nThe International Workingmen's Association took up the demand for an eight-hour day at its Congress in Geneva in 1866, declaring \"The legal limitation of the working day is a preliminary condition without which all further attempts at improvements and emancipation of the working class must prove abortive\", and \"The Congress proposes eight hours as the legal limit of the working day.\"\n\nKarl Marx saw it as of vital importance to the workers' health, writing in \"Das Kapital\" (1867): \"By extending the working day, therefore, capitalist production...not only produces a deterioration of human labour power by robbing it of its normal moral and physical conditions of development and activity, but also produces the premature exhaustion and death of this labour power itself.\"\n\nAlthough there were initial successes in achieving an eight-hour day in New Zealand and by the Australian labour movement for skilled workers in the 1840s and 1850s, most employed people had to wait to the early and mid twentieth century for the condition to be widely achieved through the industrialised world through legislative action.\n\nThe first country to adopt eight-hour working day nationwide was Uruguay on November 17, 1915, by the government of José Batlle y Ordóñez. Nevertheless, the law was not effective on all type of works.\n\nSpain became on April 3, 1919 the first country in the world to introduce a universal law effective on all type of works, restricting the workday to a maximum of eight hours. The \"Real decreto de 3 de abril de 1919\" was signed by the prime minister, Álvaro de Figueroa, 1st Count of Romanones.\n\nThe first international treaty to mention it was the Treaty of Versailles in the annex of its thirteenth part establishing the International Labour Office, now the International Labour Organization.\n\nThe eight-hour day was the first topic discussed by the International Labour Organization which resulted in the Hours of Work (Industry) Convention, 1919 ratified by 52 countries as of 2016.\n\nThe eight-hour day movement forms part of the early history for the celebration of Labour Day, and May Day in many nations and cultures.\n\nIn Iran in 1918, the work of reorganizing the trade unions began in earnest in Tehran during the closure of the Iranian constitutional parliament Majles. The printers' union, established in 1906 by Mohammad Parvaneh as the first trade union, in the Koucheki print shop on Nasserieh Avenue in Tehran, reorganized their union under leadership of Russian-educated Seyed Mohammad Dehgan, a newspaper editor and an avowed Communist. In 1918, the newly organised union staged a 14-day strike and succeeded in reaching a collective agreement with employers to institute the eight-hours day, overtime pay, and medical care. The success of the printers' union encouraged other trades to organize. In 1919 the bakers and textile-shop clerks formed their own trade unions.\n\nHowever the eight-hours day only became as code by a limited governor's decree on 1923 by the governor of Kerman, Sistan and Balochistan, which controlled the working conditions and working hours for workers of carpet workshops in the province. In 1946 the council of ministers issued the first labor law for Iran, which recognized the eight-hour day.\n\nThe first company to introduce an eight-hour working day in Japan was the Kawasaki Dockyards in Kobe (now the Kawasaki Shipbuilding Corporation). An eight-hour day was one of the demands presented by the workers during pay negotiations in September 1919. After the company resisted the demands, a slowdown campaign was commenced by the workers on 18 September. After ten days of industrial action, company president Kōjirō Matsukata agreed to the eight-hour day and wage increases on 27 September, which became effective from October. The effects of the action were felt nationwide and inspired further industrial action at the Kawasaki and Mitsubishi shipyards in 1921.\n\nThe eight-hour day did not become law in Japan until the passing of the Labor Standards Act in April 1947. Article 32 (1) of the Act specifies a 40-hour week and paragraph (2) specifies an eight-hour day, excluding rest periods.\n\nIn Indonesia, the first policy regarding working time regulated in Law No. 13 of 2003 about employment. In the law, it stated that a worker should work for 7 hours a day for 6 days a week or 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, excluding rest periods.\n\nThe 8-hour work day was introduced in Belgium on September 9, 1924.\n\nThe 8-hour work day was first introduced in 1907. Within the next few decades, the 8-hour system spread gradually across technically all branches of work. A worker receives 150% payment from the first two extra hours, and 200% salary if the work day exceeds 10 hours.\n\nThe eight-hour day was enacted in France by Georges Clemenceau, as a way to avoid unemployment and diminish communist support. It was succeeded by a strong French support of it during the writing of the International Labour Organization Convention of 1919.\n\nThe first German company to introduce the eight-hour day was Degussa in 1884. The eight-hour day was signed into law during the German Revolution of 1918.\n\nIn Hungary, the eight-hour work day was introduced on April 14, 1919 by decree of the Revolutionary Governing Council.\n\nIn Poland, the eight-hour day was introduced November 23, 1918 by decree of the cabinet of the Prime Minister Jędrzej Moraczewski.\n\nIn Portugal a vast wave of strikes occurred in 1919, supported by the National Workers' Union, the biggest labour union organisation at the time. The workers achieved important objectives, including the historic victory of an eight-hour day.\n\nIn USSR, the eight-hour day was introduced four days after the October Revolution, by a Decree of the Soviet government in 1917–1928, and later 1940-1957 (World War II).\n\nIn the region of Alcoy, a workers strike in 1873 for the eight-hour day followed much agitation from the anarchists. In 1919 in Barcelona, after a 44-day general strike with over 100,000 participants had effectively crippled the Catalan economy, the Government settled the strike by granting all the striking workers demands that included an eight-hour day, union recognition, and the rehiring of fired workers.\nTherefore, Spain became on April 3, 1919 the first country in the world to introduce a universal law effective on all type of works, restricting the workday to a maximum of eight hours: \"Real decreto de 3 de abril de 1919\", signed by the prime minister, Álvaro de Figueroa, 1st Count of Romanones.\n\nThe Factory Act of 1833 limited the work day for children in factories. Those aged 9–13 could work only eight hours, 14–18 12 hours. Children under 9 were required to attend school.\n\nIn 1884, Tom Mann joined the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) and published a pamphlet calling for the working day to be limited to eight hours. Mann formed an organisation, the Eight Hour League, which successfully pressured the Trades Union Congress to adopt the eight-hour day as a key goal. The British socialist economist Sidney Webb and the scholar Harold Cox co-wrote a book supporting the \"Eight Hours Movement\" in Britain.\nThe first group of Workers to achieve the 8 hour day were the Beckton [ East London] Gas workers after the strike under the leadership of Will Thorne, a member of the Social Democratic Foundation. The strike action was initiated on March 31, 1889 after the introduction of compulsory 18 hour shifts, up from the previous 12 hours. Under the slogan of \" shorten our hours to prolong our lives\" the strike spread to other gas works. He petitioned the bosses and after a strike of some weeks, the bosses capitulated and three shifts of 8 hours replaced two shifts of 12 hours. Will Thorne founded the Gas Workers and General Labourers Union, which evolved into the modern GMB union.\n\nWorking hours in the UK are currently not limited by day, but by week, as first set by the Working Time Regulations of 1998, which introduced a limit of 40 hours per week for workers under 18, and 48 hours per week for over 18s. This was in line with the European Commission Working Time Directive of 1993. UK regulations now follow the EC Working Time Directive of 2003, but workers can voluntarily opt out of the 48 hour limit. A general 8 hour limit to the working day has never been achieved in the UK.\n\nThe labour movement in Canada tracked progress in the US and UK. In 1890, the Federation of Labour took up this issue, hoping to organise participation in May Day.\nIn the 1960s Canada adopt the 40-hour work week.\n\nThe Mexican Revolution of 1910–1920 produced the Constitution of 1917, which contained Article 123 that gave workers the right to organise labour unions and to strike. It also provided protection for women and children, the eight-hour day, and a living wage. \"See Mexican labour law\".\n\nIn the United States, Philadelphia carpenters went on strike in 1791 for the ten-hour day. By the 1830s, this had become a general demand. In 1835, workers in Philadelphia organised the first general strike in North America, led by Irish coal heavers. Their banners read, \"From 6 to 6, ten hours work and two hours for meals.\" Labor movement publications called for an \"eight-hour day\" as early as 1836. Boston ship carpenters, although not unionised, achieved an eight-hour day in 1842.\n\nIn 1864, the eight-hour day quickly became a central demand of the Chicago labor movement. The Illinois legislature passed a law in early 1867 granting an eight-hour day but it had so many loopholes that it was largely ineffective. A citywide strike that began on 1 May 1867 shut down the city's economy for a week before collapsing.\n\nOn 25 June 1868, Congress passed an eight-hour law for federal employees which was also of limited effectiveness. It established an eight-hour workday for laborers and mechanics employed by the Federal Government. President Andrew Johnson had vetoed the act but it was passed over his veto. Johnson told a Workingmen's party delegation that he couldn't directly commit himself to an eight-hour day, he nevertheless told the same delegation that he greatly favored the \"shortest number of hours consistent with the interests of all.\" According to Richard F. Selcer, however, the intentions behind the law were \"immediately frustrated\" as wages were cut by 20%.\n\nOn 19 May 1869, President Ulysses Grant issued a National Eight Hour Law Proclamation.\n\nIn August 1866, the National Labor Union at Baltimore passed a resolution that said, \"The first and great necessity of the present to free labor of this country from capitalist slavery, is the passing of a law by which eight hours shall be the normal working day in all States of the American Union. We are resolved to put forth all our strength until this glorious result is achieved.\"\n\nDuring the 1870s, eight hours became a central demand, especially among labor organisers, with a network of Eight-Hour Leagues which held rallies and parades. A hundred thousand workers in New York City struck and won the eight-hour day in 1872, mostly for building trades workers. In Chicago, Albert Parsons became recording secretary of the Chicago Eight-Hour League in 1878, and was appointed a member of a national eight-hour committee in 1880.\n\nAt its convention in Chicago in 1884, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions resolved that \"eight hours shall constitute a legal day's labour from and after May 1, 1886, and that we recommend to labour organisations throughout this jurisdiction that they so direct their laws as to conform to this resolution by the time named.\"\n\nThe leadership of the Knights of Labor, under Terence V. Powderly, rejected appeals to join the movement as a whole, but many local Knights assemblies joined the strike call including Chicago, Cincinnati and Milwaukee. On 1 May 1886, Albert Parsons, head of the Chicago Knights of Labor, with his wife Lucy Parsons and two children, led 80,000 people down Michigan Avenue, Chicago, in what is regarded as the first modern May Day Parade, with the cry, \"Eight-hour day with no cut in pay.\" In support of the eight-hour day. In the next few days they were joined nationwide by 350,000 workers who went on strike at 1,200 factories, including 70,000 in Chicago, 45,000 in New York, 32,000 in Cincinnati, and additional thousands in other cities. Some workers gained shorter hours (eight or nine) with no reduction in pay; others accepted pay cuts with the reduction in hours.\nOn 3 May 1886, August Spies, editor of the \"Arbeiter-Zeitung\" (Workers Newspaper), spoke at a meeting of 6,000 workers, and afterwards many of them moved down the street to harass strikebreakers at the McCormick plant in Chicago. The police arrived, opened fire, and killed four people, wounding many more. At a subsequent rally on 4 May to protest this violence, a bomb exploded at the Haymarket Square. Hundreds of labor activists were rounded up and the prominent labor leaders arrested, tried, convicted, and executed giving the movement its first martyrs. On 26 June 1893 Illinois Governor John Peter Altgeld set the remaining leader free, and granted full pardons to all those tried claiming they were innocent of the crime for which they had been tried and the hanged men had been the victims of \"hysteria, packed juries and a biased judge\".\n\nThe American Federation of Labor, meeting in St Louis in December 1888, set 1 May 1890 as the day that American workers should work no more than eight hours. The International Workingmen's Association (Second International), meeting in Paris in 1889, endorsed the date for international demonstrations, thus starting the international tradition of May Day.\n\nThe United Mine Workers won an eight-hour day in 1898.\n\nThe Building Trades Council (BTC) of San Francisco, under the leadership of P. H. McCarthy, won the eight-hour day in 1900 when the BTC unilaterally declared that its members would work only eight hours a day for $3 a day. When the mill resisted, the BTC began organising mill workers; the employers responded by locking out 8,000 employees throughout the Bay Area. The BTC, in return, established a union planing mill from which construction employers could obtain supplies – or face boycotts and sympathy strikes if they did not. The mill owners went to arbitration, where the union won the eight-hour day, a closed shop for all skilled workers, and an arbitration panel to resolve future disputes. In return, the union agreed to refuse to work with material produced by non-union planing mills or those that paid less than the Bay Area employers.\n\nBy 1905, the eight-hour day was widely installed in the printing trades – see – but the vast majority of Americans worked 12- to 14-hour days.\n\nIn the 1912 Presidential Election Teddy Roosevelts Progressive Party campaign platform included the eight-hour work day.\n\nOn 5 January 1914, the Ford Motor Company took the radical step of doubling pay to $5 a day and cut shifts from nine hours to eight, moves that were not popular with rival companies, although seeing the increase in Ford's productivity, and a significant increase in profit margin (from $30 million to $60 million in two years), most soon followed suit.\n\nIn the summer of 1915, amid increased labor demand for World War I, a series of strikes demanding the eight-hour day began in Bridgeport, Connecticut. They were so successful that they spread throughout the Northeast.\n\nThe United States Adamson Act in 1916 established an eight-hour day, with additional pay for overtime, for railroad workers. This was the first federal law that regulated the hours of workers in private companies. The United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Act in \"Wilson v. New\", .\n\nThe eight-hour day might have been realised for many working people in the US in 1937, when what became the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S. Code Chapter 8) was first proposed under the New Deal. As enacted, the act applied to industries whose combined employment represented about twenty percent of the US labor force. In those industries, it set the maximum workweek at 40 hours, but provided that employees working beyond 40 hours a week would receive additional overtime bonus salaries.\n\nIn Puerto Rico in May 1899, while under US administration, General George W. Davis acceded to Island demands and decreed freedom of assembly, speech, press, religion and an eight-hour day for government employees.\n\nThe Australian gold rushes attracted many skilled tradesmen to Australia. Some of them had been active in the Chartist movement in Britain, and subsequently became prominent in the campaign for better working conditions in the Australian colonies. Workers began winning an eight-hour day in various companies and industries in the 1850s.\n\nThe Stonemasons' Society in Sydney issued an ultimatum to employers on 18 August 1855 saying that after six months masons would work only an eight-hour day. Due to the rapid increase in population caused by the gold rushes, many buildings were being constructed, so skilled labour was scarce. Stonemasons working on the Holy Trinity Church and the Mariners' Church (an evangelical mission to seafarers), decided not to wait and pre-emptively went on strike, thus winning the eight-hour day. They celebrated with a victory dinner on 1 October 1855 which to this day is celebrated as a Labour Day holiday in the state of New South Wales. When the six-month ultimatum expired in February 1856, stonemasons generally agitated for a reduction of hours. Although opposed by employers, a two-week strike on the construction of Tooth's Brewery on Parramatta Road proved effective, and stonemasons won an eight-hour day by early March 1856, but with a reduction in wages to match.\n\nAgitation was also occurring in Melbourne where the craft unions were more militant. Stonemasons working on Melbourne University organised to down tools on 21 April 1856 and march to Parliament House with other members of the building trade. The movement in Melbourne was led by veteran Chartists, and masons James Stephens, T.W. Vine and James Galloway. The government agreed that workers employed on public works should enjoy an eight-hour day with no loss of pay and stonemasons celebrated with a holiday and procession on Monday 12 May 1856, when about 700 people marched with 19 trades involved. By 1858, the eight-hour day was firmly established in the building industry and by 1860, the eight-hour day was fairly widely worked in Victoria. From 1879, the eight-hour day was a public holiday in Victoria. The initial success in Melbourne led to the decision to organise a movement, to actively spread the eight-hour idea, and secure the condition generally.\n\nIn 1903, veteran socialist Tom Mann spoke to a crowd of a thousand people at the unveiling of the Eight Hour Day monument, funded by public subscription, on the south side of Parliament House on Spring St. It was relocated in 1923 to the corner of Victoria and Russell Streets outside Melbourne Trades Hall.\n\nIt took further campaigning and struggles by trade unions to extend the reduction in hours to all workers in Australia. In 1916 the \"Victoria Eight Hours Act\" was passed granting the eight-hour day to all workers in the state. The eight-hour day was not achieved nationally until the 1920s. The Commonwealth Arbitration Court gave approval of the 40-hour five-day working week nationally beginning on 1 January 1948. The achievement of the eight-hour day has been described by historian Rowan Cahill as \"one of the great successes of the Australian working class during the nineteenth century, demonstrating to Australian workers that it was possible to successfully organise, mobilise, agitate, and exercise significant control over working conditions and quality of life. The Australian trade union movement grew out of eight-hour campaigning and the movement that developed to promote the principle.\"\n\nThe intertwined numbers 888 soon adorned the pediment of many union buildings around Australia. The Eight Hour March, which began on 21 April 1856, continued each year until 1951 in Melbourne, when the conservative Victorian Trades Hall Council decided to forgo the tradition for the Moomba festival on the Labour Day weekend. In capital cities and towns across Australia, Eight Hour day marches became a regular social event each year, with early marches often restricted to those workers who had won an eight-hour day.\n\nPromoted by Samuel Duncan Parnell as early as 1840, when carpenter Samuel Parnell refused to work more than eight hours a day when erecting a store for merchant George Hunter. He successfully negotiated this working condition and campaigned for its extension in the infant Wellington community. A meeting of Wellington carpenters in October 1840 pledged \"to maintain the eight-hour working day, and that anyone offending should be ducked into the harbour\".\n\nParnell is reported to have said: \"There are twenty-four hours per day given us; eight of these should be for work, eight for sleep, and the remaining eight for recreation and in which for men to do what little things they want for themselves.\" With tradesmen in short supply the employer was forced to accept Parnell's terms. Parnell later wrote, \"the first strike for eight hours a day the world has ever seen, was settled on the spot\".\n\nEmigrants to the new settlement of Dunedin, Otago, while on board ship decided on a reduction of working hours. When the resident agent of the New Zealand Company, Captain Cargill, attempted to enforce a ten-hour day in January 1849 in Dunedin, he was unable to overcome the resistance of trades people under the leadership of house painter and plumber, Samuel Shaw. Building trades in Auckland achieved the eight-hour day on 1 September 1857 after agitation led by Chartist painter, William Griffin. For many years the eight-hour day was confined to craft tradesmen and unionised workers. Labour Day, which commemorates the introduction of the eight-hour day, became a national public holiday in 1899.\n\nA strike for the eight-hour day was held in May 1919 in Peru. In Uruguay, the eight-hour day was put in place in 1915 of several reforms implemented during the second term of president José Batlle y Ordóñez. It was introduced in Chile on 8 September 1924 at the demand of then-general Luis Altamirano as part of the \"Ruido de sables\" that culminated in the September Junta.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2100114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100114", "title": "Stranger in Paradise (song)", "text": "Stranger in Paradise (song)\n\n\"Stranger in Paradise\" is a popular song from the musical \"Kismet\" (1953), and is credited to Robert Wright and George Forrest. Like almost all the music in that show, the melody was taken from music composed by Alexander Borodin (1833–1887), in this case, the \"Gliding Dance of the Maidens\", from the \"Polovtsian Dances\" in the opera \"Prince Igor\" (1890). The song in the musical is a lovers' duet and describes the transcendent feelings that love brings to their surroundings. Later versions were mostly edited to be sung by male solo artists.\n\nIn Act 1 of the musical \"Kismet\", the beautiful Marsinah is viewing the garden of a house her father wishes to buy. The young Caliph, who is dressed in disguise, has already been struck by her beauty from afar and enters the garden pretending to be a gardener, so that he might speak to her. She begins to sing about how the garden has been strangely transformed before her eyes. He takes over the song and sings about how he, too, strangely feels he has entered paradise when he stands beside an angel such as she. In the song he asks for an indication that she feels the same way about him. Though she feels a strong draw to him she breaks from the song and asks him a mundane question about what flowers to plant. He asks her to meet him again in the garden at moonrise, and she instantly agrees. He asks her to promise she'll keep her rendezvous, and she now takes up the song, singing that it was his face that had made her feel in paradise. They now sing together that they are in bliss in each other's company and how much they need to know the other cares.\n\nA popular adaptation of Borodin's theme from \"Prince Igor\" called \"My Fantasy\" which used the same melody as \"Stranger in Paradise\" was recorded by Artie Shaw in 1940, though the lyrics differ completely from \"Stranger in Paradise.\" \nRichard Kiley and Doretta Morrow performed the song in the original cast of \"Kismet\" (1953). Vic Damone and Ann Blyth performed the song in the 1955 film.\n\nThe most popular version was sung by Tony Bennett (1953), but other versions by The Four Aces (backed by the Jack Pleis Orchestra) and Tony Martin also received popular favor in 1954. Bennett's version reached number one in the UK Singles Chart in May 1955. It was not until 1955 that \"Kismet\", and thus the songs from the show, came to London. It was Bennett's debut hit record in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe huge popularity of \"Stranger in Paradise\" in the UK is reflected by the fact that no fewer than six versions charted in 1955: besides the chart topper by Tony Bennett, others include the versions by the Four Aces (No. 6), Tony Martin (No. 6), Bing Crosby (No. 17), Don Cornell (No. 19), as well as an instrumental version by Eddie Calvert (No. 14) in the UK chart listings. In the same year, the song was recorded in France by Gloria Lasso as \"Étranger au paradis\".\n\nBilly Eckstine with the Hal Mooney Orchestra, Mose Allison, Peter Bernstein (guitarist), Sarah Brightman, Sammy Davis, Jr., Percy Faith, Al Hirt, Engelbert Humperdinck, Gordon MacRae, Johnny Mathis, Keely Smith, Ray Conniff, Curtis Counce, Isaac Hayes, the Ink Spots, Jack Jones, Mantovani, Martin Denny, Wes Montgomery, André Rieu, Saint Etienne, Alexander Armstrong, George Shearing, Sun Ra, the Supremes and Toots Thielemans are among the other artists who have recorded cover versions of this standard. Neil Young has performed the song live.\n\nIn 1965, the Ventures released their version of the song, renamed \"The Stranger\" and \"Ten Seconds To Heaven\".\n\nAn instrumental arrangement of the song is used in the 1979 Russ Meyer movie \"Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens\".\n\nIn the film \"Breakfast of Champions\" (1999), based on the book of the same name by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., the song is used as a recurring motif.\n\nIn the 2001 anime series \"RahXephon\" the song is used as a recurring motif.\n\nIn 2011, Tony Bennett rerecorded the song as a duet with Andrea Bocelli for Bennett's album \"Duets II\". Also in 2011, the anime \"Appleseed XIII\" used instrumental versions of the song for both its starting and ending themes.\n"}

In the episode, the children of South Park remove all adults from the town by claiming that they molested them. With the town to themselves, they create a new society, but it quickly deteriorates and separate groups are formed. Much of the episode's plot is inspired by the 1984 film \"Children of the Corn\", based on the Stephen King short story.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, fans voted \"The Wacky Molestation Adventure\" as the best episode of Season 4.\n\nCartman has four tickets to the \"Raging Pussies\" concert and the boys all want to go. When Kyle asks his parents for permission, they characteristically prohibit him from going. After relentless negotiation, Kyle's mom sarcastically agrees that Kyle can go if he cleans out the garage, shovels all the snow from the driveway and brings democracy to Cuba - all of which Kyle manages to achieve, the third by writing a heartfelt letter to Fidel Castro (similar to a musical number from \"The Year Without a Santa Claus\"). It is later announced on the news that Kyle has brought democracy to Cuba and American tourists are now allowed in. Despite his success, his parents still refuse to let him go. In his fury, he questions his parents' authority and angrily wishes that he had no parents at all.\n\nWhen Kyle shares his frustration with his friends, Cartman suggests that he call the police and tell them that his parents have been \"molestering\" him, which will make them go away (a trick he played on his mother's ex-boyfriend). After some practice to get the accusation right, Kyle makes the call and the police arrest his parents, despite Sheila's tearful pleas that she nor Gerald did such a thing as they are taken away. The boys then go to the concert and Kyle later hosts a party at his parent-free home and dances in his white underwear to the song \"Old Time Rock and Roll\" (a reference to a classic scene in \"Risky Business\"). Seeing how liberated they are without parents, all of the children begin calling the police on their parents and teachers resulting in the adults being taken to prison. Even Shelley, Stan's sister, is arrested after she is about to attack Stan as he celebrates their parents' arrest (though it is never shown what happens to her while the adults are in jail). Soon, nearly all of the town's adults have been arrested, the rest having moved away over fears of being arrested and only the children populate the town. With the adults gone and the town in the children's control, Stan declares, \"It's ours.\"\n\nSometime later, a couple from out of town, Mark and Linda Cotner, are having car trouble as they approach the limits of \"Smiley Town\" (the South Park sign has been overwritten with \"Smiley Town\"). They make it to a garage where they meet Butters and Craig. They ask for the nearest phone and are told that it is in \"Treasure Cove\". They also discover that South Park has been divided into \"Smiley Town\" and \"Treasure Cove\" by a long white line. Mark and Linda attempt to enter \"Treasure Cove\" but are attacked by kindergarteners and driven back into Smiley Town. Craig and others come to their rescue and take them to meet the mayor of \"Smiley Town\" a.k.a. Cartman. Knowing that a ritual called \"Carousel\" is going to be held that night, Cartman asks Mark and Linda to go to Treasure Cove and retrieve a book for him. Getting the book will force a member of Treasure Cove to be sacrificed to \"The Provider\": a statue of John Elway with bodies next to it (Kenny is seen as one of the sacrifices). Mark and Linda agree to help, find the book, are attacked by residents of Treasure Cove, and taken back to the elementary school where Stan and Kyle are in charge. \n\nStan asks why Mark and Linda are helping Cartman and offers to get them to the nearest phone if Mark and Linda agrees to help them instead. He then tells them the story of \"the before time in the long, long ago\", which includes the reasons for the existence of Smiley Town, Treasure Cove, \"Carousel\", \"The Provider\", and \"The M Word\". Mark and Linda then agree to get the book from Smiley Town. Meanwhile, their parents are in prison working out their \"sick sexual urges\" with a counselor who helps them identify alternative activities to molesting their children.\n\nBack in South Park, Mark gets Cartman's book for Stan and Mayor Cartman chooses Butters to be sacrificed. Realizing the danger to Butters, Mark and Linda attempt to interfere with the ceremony. In response, Cartman threatens to call the police and claim that the couple \"molestered\" the children. Mark realizes that the town has descended into anarchy because the parents were all falsely accused of molesting the children. He explains to the kids in a speech that their parents, the \"birth givers\", \"are\" their providers. The word \"parents\" resonates with the children and causes them to remember. Stan then reveals that it has only been ten days since the town's parents and adults left, much to Mark and Linda's surprise. The children allow Mark to make his important phone call and to also call to the police, clearing their parents of all wrongdoing. Mark tells Linda that maybe they should have children, but after all they have been through, she decides to get her tubes tied.\n\nAs the children await the return of their parents, Mark and Linda drive up and announce that Linda got her tubes tied, and reveal that Mark got the job that his \"important call\" was for: the manager of a Denny's restaurant in Breckenridge. When the parents arrive, they now believe they are \"cured\" of the \"sick sexual urges\" that they never had (after they've been conditioned to believe they actually had molested their kids). The parents are reunited with their children, the latter who are confused by their parents' actions. Ultimately, and to Mark and Linda's surprise, the boys decide to immediately make snow igloos (indicating that they do not care about their parents' traumatic ordeal since the problem had seemed to resolve itself and as if the events of the past ten days never happened).\n\n"}

{"id": "2100138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100138", "title": "Newton Abbot railway station", "text": "Newton Abbot railway station\n\nNewton Abbot railway station serves the town of Newton Abbot in Devon, England. It is down the line from and measured from via , at the junction for the branch to . The station today is managed by Great Western Railway, who provide the train service along with CrossCountry.\n\nFor many years, it was also the junction for Moretonhampstead and the site of a large locomotive workshop.\n\nThe station was opened by the South Devon Railway Company on 30 December 1846 when its line was extended from Teignmouth railway station. It was opened through to on 20 June 1847 and a branch to Torquay was added on 18 December 1848. The Moretonhampstead and South Devon Railway opened its branch line on 26 June 1866. All these railways used the broad gauge.\n\nApproaching the station from the town along Queen Street, people first saw the large goods shed. On the opposite side of the line was the pumping house for the atmospheric railway system that powered the trains for a short while. The passenger station was situated to the south of these buildings. It originally consisted to two – later three – small train sheds covering separate platforms for trains running in each direction to Exeter, Plymouth, and Torquay. It was rebuilt in 1861 as a single station with a larger train shed covering all three platforms.\n\nOn 1 February 1876 the South Devon Railway, which had already amalgamated with the Moretonhampstead company, was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway. The station was originally known as just \"Newton\" but this was changed to \"Newton Abbot\" on 1 March 1877.\n\nThe last broad gauge train ran on 20 May 1892, after which all the lines in the area were converted to standard gauge over the space of a weekend. The workshops at Newton Abbot played a part in converting broad gauge locomotives, carriages and wagons to standard gauge over the following months.\n\nPlans were put forward to rebuild the station with four platforms, but World War I delayed the plans. The goods facilities were moved onto the Moretonhampstead branch line on 12 June 1911, and some sidings were laid at Hackney on 17 December 1911 to replace those near the engine shed. These alterations paved the way for the expansion of the station following the war, the rebuilt station eventually being opened by Lord Mildmay of Flete on 11 April 1927. The station, built to the designs of the Chief Architect of the Great Western Railway, Percy Emerson Culverhouse, now faced the town along Queen Street rather than the old wooden goods shed.\n\nAn old broad gauge 0-4-0 locomotive, \"Tiny\", was put on display on the station platform to provide a link with the past.\n\nThe southbound platform had to be rebuilt again following an air raid on 20 August 1940, during World War II. Six bombs were dropped killing 14 people, although one failed to explode.\n\nThe Moretonhampstead line lost its passenger trains on 28 February 1959. Goods trains were cut back to Bovey railway station from 6 April 1964 and from 6 July 1970 were run no further than Heathfield. The final regular traffic ran in 1996.\n\nThe last trains used the former Platform 4 on 24 April 1987; the removal of the platform allowed a level entrance to be opened from the road and an extended car park to be built. Also removed were the loop lines that allowed fast trains to pass the station without passing a platform. Resignalling was completed over the following week and bank holiday weekend. Full operation was restored from 5 May 1987, now controlled from the panel signal box at Exeter. A new junction was installed for the Paignton branch and the signals now allow trains to run either way on each track.\n\nSome of the signalling equipment was taken to the Newton Abbot Town and GWR Museum, where it forms part of an interactive display that shows how the railway shaped the town. It was also at about this time that \"Tiny\" was removed from its position on the platform and moved to Buckfastleigh railway station where it is displayed in the museum of the South Devon Railway Trust.\n\nThe remaining section of the Moretonhampstead line was taken out of use in 2009 when 'temporary stop blocks' were placed on the line from the junction at Newton Abbot. The line to Heathfield has since been re-opened, seeing daily timber trains in 2012 to Chirk in Wales.\n\nSouth West Trains ran services until December 2009 between London Waterloo and Plymouth and Paignton, before withdrawing services west of Exeter to form an hourly service from Exeter St Davids to London Waterloo.\n\nThe station was 'open' for many years after the staffed ticket gate was removed from the ticket office but in August 2017 ticket barriers were installed again, this time in a new building on the platform.\n\nNewton Abbot has proved to be an accident-prone station. On 22 August 1851 the locomotive \"Brigand\" was derailed and Switchman Bidgood had to pay one pound towards its repairs.\n\nThe investigation into a collision in August 1875 revealed that it was normal practice at Newton to ignore the signal that controlled movements from the siding to the main line, as a result of which it was decided to interlock the signals and points here, one of the first such installations to be authorised on the South Devon Railway.\n\nOn 21 October 1892 an engine shunting the siding at Aller Junction derailed and fell on its side.\n\nIn more recent times, a collision occurred on 25 March 1994 when a Class 158 DMU, working a to Cardiff service, ran into the back of a Class 43 standing in the platform with a to Edinburgh train. Thirty-one people were injured. Then in March 1997 a similar train from London was derailed by a bearing failure as it approached the station.\n\n\nThe main entrance is on the west side of the station (at the top of the diagram, right), facing Courtenay Park and Queen Street which leads into the town centre. The main entrance is through South Devon House, the building opened in 1927. This involves a couple of steps up to the platform, but a step-free route leads from the taxi rank on the south side of the building. The car park is beyond this on the site of the former Platform 4. At the north end of this platform are a former terminal platform and sidings alongside Tucker's Maltings which used to serve the Moretonhampstead branch.\n\nAfter many years as an 'open station', new ticket barriers were installed in August 2017.\n\nThere are now just three tracks in use for passenger trains. The platform nearest the entrance (Platform 3) is used by most trains running beyond Exeter to London, the north of England and Scotland. A wide footbridge, which is served by both stairs and lifts, leads to the southbound platform. The track on the west side (Platform 2) is mainly used by trains to and Penzance, while the east side (Platform 1) is mainly used by trains to and from Paignton.\n\nTrains from Paignton can use either side of the station, long-distance services are generally switched to the main line south of the station so use the same platform as trains from Plymouth while local trains to Exeter and tend to run the \"wrong way\" through the same platform that they use when running \"to\" Paignton and then join the main line north of the station. Similarly, trains to Paignton often use the Plymouth platform if another train is blocking the usual Paignton platform.\n\nThe industrial area opposite the station was the site of the South Devon Railway workshops, its engine shed being situated a little to the north of the station. Beyond this was established Hackney marshalling yard, where goods trains were—and indeed still are from time to time—reformed for the journey over the hills towards Plymouth.\n\n\"Located at \"\n\nA new marshalling yard was opened at Hackney, just north of the station, on 17 December 1911. It is a useful staging point for freight trains travelling over the steep inclines of Dartmoor on the way to Plymouth as these trains either have to be shorter or use additional locomotives compared with the flat route from Exeter.\n\nThe sidings were closed to scheduled traffic on 10 January 1971. They have now been refurbished, although the number of sidings is greatly reduced. They were temporarily used for offloading stone traffic during the 1990s, but now see regular cement trains to on the Looe branch in Cornwall. These are split into two portions, one being left here while the Freightliner locomotive takes the first section forward before returning later in the day for the remaining wagons. The sidings are also used for stabling railway engineers' vehicles. In 2012 a new Network Rail Recycling Depot was opened. This has resulted in regular engineers' trains bringing sections of rail to the yard for cutting before being sold to local scrap merchants.\n\n\"Located at \"\n\nThe first engine shed was established to the north end of the station opposite Tucker's Maltings. A workshop for the locomotive contractors was also established opposite the station and this was expanded over the years to include facilities for maintaining the railway's carriages and wagons. An old 0-4-0 locomotive, \"Tiny\", was installed in the workshops to power the machinery. When it was no longer required for this role it was restored and put on display on the station platform. It has since been moved to the railway museum at and is the only original British broad gauge locomotive that survives.\n\nThe original engine shed was closed in 1893, and a new eight-road standard GWR pattern shed along the lines of those at Salisbury and Exeter—with northlight pattern roof—was constructed under the initial code NA. The coaling stage was a non-standard wooden trussed lean-to affair, with the coaling ramp level with the yard, while the approach roads where the locomotives were refueled some below yard level. This made adding an ash shelter later during World War II especially easy. The single standard over-girder pattern turntable was installed in 1926.\n\nDesignated and designed as the major shed for the region, it was constructed as a heavy maintenance repair shop. The associated locomotive Factory had access to heavy lifting equipment, and engineering facilities to maintain, repair and overhaul all types of GWR locomotive. Locomotives could be put into the Factory roads by means of a traversing table at the East (Exeter and London) end. The last British Rail steam engine to be overhauled in the workshops was ex-GWR 4500 Class number 4566, outshopped on 15 July 1966. Although some steam engines belonging to the private Dart Valley Railway company were overhauled in the factory after it had closed to BR work, and the old steam shed was also used to do some work on these privately owned engines.\n\nTo the west, the site also had a six-road carriage and wagon works, suitable for maintenance and repair of all types of rolling stock. Cleaning was carried out on tracks between the station and the locomotive sheds.\n\nAfter the decision to switch to diesel traction, the site was completely rebuilt in 1962 to accommodate diesels, including the Warship Class that were used on the Exeter to Waterloo services. The Factory was reformed to provide four roads with servicing pits and cab level platforms, providing facilities to repair eight locomotives at the same time. Access was via the existing traversing table. A daily servicing and fuelling point was built beside the old steam shed and it was this which provided the main facility after the factory closed in 1970.\n\nDiesel multiple units were serviced in another open ended shed next to the carriage cleaning tracks. This shed was subsequently used to repair the electric train heating and air conditioning on the new Mark 3 and Mark 4 coaching stock.\n\nThe diesel repair sheds were closed in 1970, although a locomotive and coach servicing/fuel facility remained until 1981 when servicing was transferred to Laira Traction Maintenance Depot where the new High Speed Trains were maintained. An industrial estate now occupies the site. Two of the works' buildings survived into the 21st Century however one caught fire on 29 October 2018; the sheds were due to be demolished in early November. Five boys were later arrested on suspicion of arson.\n\n\"Located at \"\n\nThe branch to Torquay originally left the main line in the station area and ran parallel with the Plymouth line for before the latter swung off into the hills at Aller. A proper junction, known as Torquay Junction, was put here on 29 January 1855 as the two single lines had now become part of the double-track line from Newton to Totnes, trains on the single-track Torquay branch running on the correct line between the junction and the station.\n\nIn 1874 the branch was extended to the station, running parallel with the Plymouth line as it had done before 1855. There were now three tracks on this section but on 22 May 1876 the branch was doubled as far as , which meant a fourth track was added. The tracks were (from east to west) down branch, up branch, down main, up main.\n\nIn 1914, along with the rebuilding of the station, it was proposed to install a flying junction at Aller to speed up the passage of trains coming off the branch. The plans were shelved due to World War I, but on 24 May 1925 a junction was once again installed where the two lines diverged, now known as Aller Junction. The four tracks were now grouped by direction of travel – down relief, down main, up relief, up main. Trains for either line could use either track between the junction and the station but trains to and from the branch generally used the \"relief\" lines. This meant that trains coming off the branch had to cross over the line used by trains going towards Plymouth which could cause delays at busy times. The junction was moved during the 1987 resignalling to a new position about closer to the station. Trains can now run to and from the branch on a single line connection with their own platform, or cross over to the Plymouth–Exeter tracks on either side of the station as may be convenient.\n\nA private siding was opened on the Torquay branch in 1866 for sand traffic from a nearby pit. It was removed in 1964.\n\nFrom the south, the trains of two different operators converge on Newton Abbot from Penzance and Plymouth on the main line, and from Paignton on the Riviera Line. The main line service to London Paddington station is operated by Great Western Railway, along with local trains to Exeter and Exmouth. The London services include the overnight Night Riviera and daytime Cornish Riviera Express to Penzance, and the midday Torbay Express to Paignton. CrossCountry operate trains through Birmingham to Manchester, the north east of England ( and ) and Scotland (, & ).\n"}
{"id": "2100140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100140", "title": "Casa Ricordi", "text": "Casa Ricordi\n\nCasa Ricordi is a publisher of primarily classical music and opera. Its classical repertoire represents one of the important sources in the world through its publishing of the work of the major 19th-century Italian composers such as Gioachino Rossini, Gaetano Donizetti, Vincenzo Bellini, Giuseppe Verdi, and, later in the century, Giacomo Puccini, composers with whom one or another of the Ricordi family came into close contact.\n\nFounded in Milan in 1808 as G. Ricordi & C. by violinist Giovanni Ricordi (1785–1853), the Ricordi company became a totally family-run organization until 1919, when outside management was appointed. Four generations of Ricordis were at the helm of the company, Giovanni being succeeded in 1853 by his son Tito (1811— 1888) (who had worked for his father since 1825). Tito's son was Giulio (1840—1912). He had also worked for his father, beginning full-time in 1863, and then took over from 1888 until his death in 1912. Finally Giulio's son, also named Tito, (1865—1933) replaced his father until 1919.\n\nBy the 1840s and throughout that decade, Casa Ricordi had grown to be the largest music publisher in southern Europe and in 1842 the company created the musical journal the \"Gazzetta Musicale di Milano.\"\n\nAs younger employees under their fathers and then as leaders of the company, the succeeding Ricordis made great strides in establishing publishing relationships with opera houses outside of Milan, including La Fenice in Venice and Teatro San Carlo in Naples. They also established branches of the company within Italy — in 1864 it expanded to Naples and then to Florence (1865), Rome (1871) and Palermo, as well as in London (1875) and Paris (1888). With this expansion under the elder Tito, another of his accomplishments was in modernizing printing methods.\n\nWith the acquisition of rival publishers, by 1886 Ricordi handled 40,000 editions as well as the Italian rights to Wagner's operas. In the 20th century, the company's expansion continued with acquisitions and new branches, which included those in New York (1911), São Paulo (1927), Toronto (1954), Sydney (1956), and Mexico City (1958).\n\nIn its early days, the company established itself under the portico of the Palazzo della Ragione and then close to the La Scala opera house after 1844, eventually moving to its present location on the via Berchet. However, these premises suffered severe damage from aerial bombardment during World War II, but its collections had already been safely stored away. Following reconstruction after the war, Ricordi was converted to a limited corporation by the family in 1952 and in 1956 it became a publicly traded company. With 135,500 editions by 1991, Ricordi was acquired in 1994 by BMG Music Publishing, which in turn was purchased by Universal Music Publishing Group in 2007. It is now Italy's largest music publisher.\n\nGiovanni Ricordi, a violinist, leader of a small orchestra in Milan, as well as \"a genius and positive force in the history of Italian opera,\" in 1803 had a firm, a \"copisteria\", which specialized in producing manuscript copies of music for local music groups, and very quickly, he became official copyist for two theatres. He entered into what became a short-term partnership with Felice Festa, an engraver and music seller, but that ended in June 1808.\n\nThe first work, which the new company published in 1808, was a guitar piece by Antonio Nava. This was followed in 1814 by the first catalogue, which contained 143 items.\n\nThroughout these years he was acutely aware of the limitations of copyright law, as varied as it was throughout both the country and the continent. While he was able to secure performance rights to individual numbers and then, engraving them onto copper plates, easily make reproductions from there, he found that the full orchestral scores were still guarded in Italy, although German and French\npublishers were printing entire scores with impunity.\n\nIn fact, in regard to the printing of full scores in Italy, Macnutt in his article \"Publishing\" in Sadie, notes that: \"The full scores published in Italy in the first half of the century were eight Rossini scores printed in lithography by [two rival publishers] Ratti Cencetti & Comp. in Rome in the 1820s and a single Bellini opera, \"Beatrice di Tenda\", published by Pittarrelli about 1833, also in Rome.\"\n\nIt was through the gradual accession to the rights to control La Scala's archives, as well as subsequently-produced operas, that he was able to bypass the limitations on publishing full scores, and—as Gossett notes—\"not be its employee but a private entrepreneur from whom theatres rented materials\". In contrast, many of Ricordi's competitors produced \"hackwork manuscripts\" in no way based on the composers' autographs. In 1844, the company produced its \"Gran Catalogo\", focused on music for the theatre, and includes the work of what it called its \"house composers,\" which included Rossini, Bellini, Mercadante, Donizetti and Verdi.\n\nIn addition, another of Giovanni's strategies was to acquire—beyond just the publishing rights—the right to represent the composers to the opera companies and theatres that would present their work, so that successive performances elsewhere would bring in additional royalties. In that way, Giovanni and his successors acquired more-or-less total rights to their composers' works. As Rossini's operas gave way to those of Bellini, the rise of Donizetti following until his death, and then the preeminence of Verdi, the position of each composer was strengthened by this growing strategy.\n\nAs business expanded, it became clear to Giovanni that also producing string and choral parts, for which there would be great demand by opera house orchestras, was another means of expanding the firm's involvement and also assuring composers that there would be uniformity. However, although Ricordi began to publish full scores from the 1850s, they were never made available for sale, only for rent to opera houses. Quite quickly, as Verdi's operas became more and more popular, this approach extended to producing all of the orchestral parts for each opera, most especially the three great successes of the 1850s, \"Rigoletto\", \"Il trovatore\", and \"La traviata\", and those that followed when Tito Ricordi headed the firm.\n\nWith the nickname Jules Burgmein, Giulio Ricordi contributed a very great deal to the prestige of the Casa Ricordi as it also produced several magazines (\"La gazzetta musicale\", \"Musica e musicisti\" and \"Ars et labor\"), and various other once famous publications (\"La biblioteca del pianista\", \"l'Opera Omnia di Frédéric Chopin\", \"L'arte musicale in Italia\", \"Le Sonate di Domenico Scarlatti\").\n\nThe Ricordi company also published Giuseppe Verdi's later operas, Giulio having established a relationship with the composer as a young man. Over a ten-year period, he convinced Verdi to give the young librettist and composer Arrigo Boito the opportunity to help him to revise the original 1857 \"Simon Boccanegra\", a \"trial run\" to plant the idea of Verdi creating a new opera. They presented the revised \"Boccanegra\" in March 1881. In alliance with Verdi's wife and Verdi's friend, the conductor Franco Faccio, Ricordi's strategy was to lure the aging composer out of retirement to compose another opera. While this strategy took some years to achieve, it proved to be successful, as was the opera, \"Otello\", which brought Verdi great acclaim in Milan in 1887. It was followed by \"Falstaff\" in 1893, both set to libretti by Boito.\n\nBut Giulio also had the good sense to promote younger composers of merit, most especially the operatic career of Giacomo Puccini. Others included Amilcare Ponchielli, Alfredo Catalani, Carlos Gomes, Umberto Giordano. Their relationship began in 1884 with the company's support for the printing of the libretto of the young Puccini's first opera \"Le villi\" without charge, when it premiered on 31 May 1884 at the Teatro Dal Verme.\n\nFellow students from the Milan Conservatory formed a large part of the orchestra, and the performance was enough of a success that Casa Ricordi purchased the opera. When revised into a two-act version with an intermezzo between the acts, \"Le villi\" was performed at La Scala in Milan on 24 January 1885, and the score was published in 1887. To Puccini in particular, Giulio became something of a father-figure, feared (since Giulio often needed to be censorious over Puccini's dilatory work habits) but deeply trusted.\n\nAdditionally, under Giulio, the company went into the business of printing advertising posters that were extremely popular throughout Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Ricordi company posters included works by celebrated graphic artists such as Leonetto Cappiello, Luigi Emilio Caldanzano, Ludovico Cavaleri, Marcello Dudovich, Adolfo Hohenstein (also known as Adolf), Franz Laskoff, Leopoldo Metlicovitz, Giovanni Mario Mataloni, Aleardo Terzi and Aleardo Villa.\n\nHaving already acquired the La Scala holdings, in 1839 Giovanni bought the copyright to Giuseppe Verdi's first opera, \"Oberto\", as well as to his future compositions, thus marking the beginnings of a long working relationship with that composer by three generations of Ricordis, most especially Giulio Ricordi. However, it is known that Verdi was unhappy with the elder Tito on occasion over what appeared to be the publisher's \"sanctioning, for financial gain, mutilated performances of his works\". These concerns carried over to the 20th century.\n\nHowever, relationships with composers had begun well before 1839. In fact, shortly after Rossini's \"Tancredi\" had been staged in Venice in 1813, the composer made the acquaintance of Giovanni, who was then starting his business in Milan although still involved with La Scala. A strong relationship was established between publisher and composer and, between 1846 and 1864, the company published all of his operas for piano and voice, with the composer becoming \"...ruefully aware that music which he had reused from what he took to be a failed opera would now [upon publication] be seen to have been recycled.\" Although Rossini agreed to the publication of his work, it was not without some reservations: writing to Tito Ricordi on 14 December 1864, he accepts that publication will reveal that, \"The same pieces of music will be found in various operas,\" but notes that the time pressure to compose so many works meant that, \"I barely had time to read the so-called poetry to set to music.\" In all, Rossini also worked with three generations of Ricordis.\n\nIn 1815, the young Donizetti, then almost 18, traveled from Bergamo to Bologna with the aim of further studies, all this having been orchestrated by his teacher Simon Mayr. In addition to providing money, he equipped his young pupil with two letters, one of which was addressed to Giovanni Ricordi, for whom he had been an editorial consultant for some years. Mayr recommend the young man to the publisher, the result being that Donizetti's first composition to be published, a set of variations on a theme from Mayr's 1813 opera \"La rosa bianca e la rosa rossa\", appeared later that year. It marked the beginning of a lifelong business arrangement between Donizetti and the Ricordi company, except for difficulties in 1839 over the handling of \"Gianni di Parigi\".\n\nBy 1840, the firm had control of hiring material for many composers: it had acquired Meyerbeer's \"Il crociato in Egitto\" in 1824, followed by 19 operas by Rossini, and eight by Bellini, along with the significant group of today's lesser-known composers such as Saverio Mercadante, Nicola Vaccai, Giovanni Pacini, and the brothers Luigi Ricci and Federico Ricci. However, in spite of good relationships with their publishers, 19th century composers' scores suffered massive changes from what they originally wrote. Long after the deaths of Rossini, Bellini, and Donizetti, a variety of changes continued to be made to scores at the behest of people such as conductors who (as Gossett notes), if they \"want an extra trombone, it was added, and its origin was soon masked...the entire system encouraged a \"laissez-faire\" attitude\"... It was not until the late 19th century that the full orchestral scores of these four major composers were published by Ricordi and this \"marked the beginning of the modern era of publishing\".\n\nThe company under Tito Ricordi II\n\nWith the death of Giulio, the firm was headed by his son, Tito II, who has been described as someone who \"lacked both charm and judgment. He and Puccini disliked each other..\", the result being that the composer's \"La rondine\" was published by a rival company, Sonzogno, which also handled the work of Mascagni and Leoncavallo, \"[Puccini's] most successful contemporaries\". Upon Tito's retirement in 1919 management passed outside the family, although, with the company's control over the work of Verdi and Puccini, it retained its preeminence.\n\nPreparation of critical editions\nMany poor quality published scores from the 19th century had been poorly-copied or had become severely cut or severely added-to, leading Macnutt to note that the additions to the scores had created \"totally inauthentic versions,\" which were still being used well into the 20th century by performers: \"the widely held view [was] that the existing scores (particularly of operas from the first half of the 19th century) whether for sale or hire, often offer inaccurate or incomplete texts\". This led musicologist Philip Gossett to the view that \"by the end of the [19th] century, materials rented by Ricordi were frequently far from the composer's original\".\n\nSince 1964, under the direction of the company's then-new president, Guido Rignano, critical editions using the composers' autographs and many other sources—including access to the Verdi autographs granted to scholars by the Carrara-Verdi family at the Villa Verdi—have been prepared with increasing cooperation from Ricordi, which has allowed scholars to view the original autographs and has become a collaborator in the preparation of these critical editions.\n\nUnder the auspices of the University of Chicago's Center for Italian Opera Studies,\nThe Fondazione Donizetti, in the composer's hometown of Bergamo, has been Ricordi's collaborator in the production of critical editions of his operas under the direction of Professor Roger Parker of King's College in London and Gabriele Dotto, who led Ricordi's editorial department from 1992 to 2001.\nSimilarly, preparation of critical editions of Bellini's operas began in 1999 by Casa Ricordi working in collaboration with the Teatro Massimo Bellini in the composer's hometown of Catania. \"I Capuleti e i Montecchi\" was the first to appear under the imprint of the University of Chicago.\"La sonnambula\" is also available from Chicago in an edition edited by musicologists Luca Zoppelli of the University of Friborg, Switzerland, and Alessandro Roccatagliati of the University of Ferrara, Italy, members of a group for the Ricordi project, which also includes Fabrizio Della Seta and Claudio Toscani, editor of \"Montecchi\".\n\nAll of this cooperation has \"served gradually to enhance Ricordi's reputation among scholar and performers\" and the extent to which the huge project has already advanced and will advance is illustrated on the Universal Music Publishing Classical Critical Editions website.\n\nOther ventures\n\nSince World War II, these have included such enterprises as \"Dischi Ricordi\", the company's recording label, which began in 1958, but was preceded by the company entering into the popular music business and founding “Radio Record Ricordi” (“RRR”) ten years earlier. The first record release was Cherubini's \"Medea\" performed by Maria Callas, but the period also saw the beginning of its popular music activities.\n\nRicordi has also developed a role in the publishing of contemporary music, with a catalogue including the work of Giorgio Battistelli, Luciano Berio, Sylvano Bussotti, Franco Donatoni, Lorenzo Ferrero, Bruno Maderna, Giacomo Manzoni, Nino Rota, Salvatore Sciarrino, and Fabio Vacchi. This began in 1984 with the world premiere of \"Prometeo\" by Luigi Nono to a libretto by Massimo Cacciari, presented under the musical direction of Claudio Abbado.\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n\n"}

He is considered to be one of the leading figures of the Executed Renaissance.\n\nHe studied philology at Saint Vladimir University in Kiev. From 1917 to 1920, he edited the bibliographical journal. He was a professor of Ukrainian literature at the Kyiv Architectural Institute (1918–1920), the Kyiv Co-operative Tekhnikum (1923–1925), and the Kyiv Institute of People's Education (1923–1935). He also taught the theory of translation at the Ukrainian Institute of Linguistic Education (1930–1933).\n\nMykola Zerov was perhaps the most talented of the Neoclassicist movement of poets in 1920s Ukraine. Despite the populist and propagandistic impulses of Communism, the neoclassical movement stressed the production of 'high art' to an educated and highly literate audience. Zerov, particularly, eschewed contemporary politics in his poetry, focusing on aesthetic and historical classical themes under a tight and difficult poetical structure. This approach eventually proved fatal, as Zerov, along with many other Ukrainian writers of the period, was later sent to Solovki prison camp (he was arrested by the NKVD in April 1935 and sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment). A special NKVD troika of the Leningrad Region sentenced him to death on 9 October 1937. Zerov was shot on November 3, 1937 in Sandarmokh, Karelia.\n\nZerov was formally rehabilitated in 1958 and selections of his poetry were published in 1966, but a full rehabilitation was blocked by hostility from official critics.\n\nStreets were named after Zerov in Dnipro, Lviv, Vinnytsia, Rivne, Novomyrhorod. In 2020 Kiev's Nikolai Ostrovsky Park was renamed Mykola Zerov Park (to comply with the 2015 Ukrainian decommunization laws).\n\nAt the Australian National University, Monash University, there is a chair of Ukrainian language and Ukrainian research centre named after Zerov.\n\n"}

A successful sire, he produced 11 stakes winners.\n\nA bay colt, Alysheba was sired by Alydar out of the mare Bel Sheba, by Lt. Stevens. He was bred by Preston Madden at Hamburg Place Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, and was sold as a yearling to Dorothy and Pam Scharbauer for $500,000.\n\nTrained by Jack Van Berg, Alysheba had a modest two-year-old season in 1986, and won only a maiden race. He finished third in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, and lost the Hollywood Futurity in a photo finish. As a three-year-old, he underperformed in his preparatory races for the Kentucky Derby until it was discovered that he had an entrapped epiglottis. Surgery was successful, and he was entered in the Derby despite having only a maiden victory.\n\nIn the Derby, he and jockey Chris McCarron were nearly knocked to the ground at the top of the stretch by Bet Twice. Alysheba recovered from the collision and won the Derby in a slow time of 2:03 for 1 miles. He then came back with another win in the Preakness Stakes, then attempted to become American racing's 12th Triple Crown winner in the Belmont Stakes.\n\nIn the Belmont, Alysheba raced without the medication Lasix, which was prohibited at the time in New York racing. He finished fourth as Bet Twice won by 14 lengths. Alysheba next went to Monmouth Park for the Haskell Invitational, where he met Bet Twice, as well as Lost Code, a top-class speed horse that had won several derbies run at minor racetracks. The three horses finished together at the wire, with Bet Twice winning in a driving finish. Later in the year, Alysheba lost to Java Gold on an off track in the Travers Stakes at Saratoga Race Course; he then won the Super Derby at Louisiana Downs, his final preparation race for the Breeders' Cup Classic (the world's richest horse race at the time).\n\nIn the Breeders' Cup Classic, Alysheba met 1986 Kentucky Derby-winner Ferdinand in the first meeting of Kentucky Derby winners since Affirmed faced Spectacular Bid in the 1979 Jockey Club Gold Cup. Ferdinand (ridden by 56-year-old Willie Shoemaker) beat Alysheba in a photo finish by a nose. Alysheba lost the Horse of the Year vote to Ferdinand, but was named Champion Three-Year-Old of 1987.\n\nAs a four-year-old in 1988, Alysheba won six Grade I stakes. At Santa Anita, he won the Strub Stakes over Candi's Gold. Then he beat Ferdinand in the Santa Anita Handicap and (in another photo finish) the San Bernardino Handicap, with each horse carrying 127 pounds.\n\nAlysheba lost to his old foes Bet Twice and Lost Code in the Pimlico Special, which had been revived for the first time in three decades. He also finished behind Cutlass Reality, who upset both Alysheba and Ferdinand in the Derby winners' final meeting in the Hollywood Gold Cup. Alysheba then defeated Bet Twice in the Philip K. Iselin Handicap at Monmouth Park Racetrack. Alysheba and Bet Twice met 9 times. Alysheba defeated Bet Twice in four of those races, Bet Twice won three times, and neither horse won two of the races.\n\nIn the 35th running of the Woodward Stakes at Belmont Park, Alysheba beat an outstanding field, including 1988 Travers 1-2 finishers Forty Niner and Seeking the Gold, eventual Jockey Club Gold Cup-winner Waquoit, and Florida Derby-winner Brian's Time. He ran the 1 miles in 1:59, setting a track record. He also set the track record for 1 miles at the Meadowlands Racetrack in the Meadowlands Cup. Alysheba became the only horse in the modern era to run 10 furlongs under 2:00 three times in one calendar year.\n\nAlysheba closed out his career at Churchill Downs, winning the Breeders' Cup Classic over Seeking the Gold, Waquoit (one of the most noted off-track runners of the time), Forty Niner, and Cutlass Reality. With the victory, he secured Horse of the Year and Champion Older Horse honors. He also became the first horse to win three legs of a four-race sequence that was defined in 2015 as the Grand Slam of Thoroughbred racing: The Triple Crown races, plus the Breeders' Cup Classic, though not in the same year. As the Breeders' Cup began after the 1978 Triple Crown win of Affirmed, the potential for a sweep of all four races only became possible in 1984 and was only accomplished in 2015 after American Pharoah won the Triple Crown.\n\nAlysheba was ridden in 17 consecutive starts by Hall of Fame jockey Chris McCarron. He finished his career with a record of 11-8-2 in 26 starts. His earnings totaled $6,679,242, a record at the time.\n\nAlysheba stood at Lane's End Farm in Woodford County, Kentucky until 1999, when he was sold to a breeding operation in Saudi Arabia. He sired 11 stakes winners, of which his best was 1994 Canadian Horse of the Year Alywow. Another offspring of note was multiple stakes-winner Desert Waves. Upon the death of Genuine Risk in August 2008, Alysheba became the oldest living Kentucky Derby winner.\nIn October 2008, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia returned Alysheba to his homeland as a gift to the American people. After spending eight years in the king's royal stables, Alysheba returned to the United States to live at the Kentucky Horse Park. He lived in the stall formerly occupied by Horse of the Year John Henry and across the aisle from Cigar, the leading money-earning Thoroughbred until surpassed by Curlin in 2008.\n\nOn Friday, March 27, 2009, at 11:13 pm, Alysheba was euthanized at the Hagyard Equine Medical Institute. \"Due to a chronic degenerative spinal condition that led to ataxia and instability, Alysheba fell in his stall yesterday, injuring his right hind femur,\" said Kathy Hopkins, the Horse Park's director of equine operations. \"Complicated by his advanced age, this trauma resulted in severe pain that did not respond to analgesic therapy. The resulting pain and suffering, and the inability to stand unaided, led to a joint decision for euthanasia.\" Alysheba was buried on March 28 at the Kentucky Horse Park's Hall of Champions, across from the grave of John Henry.\n\nBesides his three Eclipse Awards for 1988 Horse of the Year, 1988 Champion Older Male, and 1987 Champion Three-Year-Old Male, Alysheba won other honors. A statue of him was erected at the front entrance to the AEGON Center in downtown Louisville, Kentucky. He was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1993. In the \"Blood-Horse\" magazine ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, Alysheba was ranked number 42.\n\nAlysheba is inbred 4x4 to Nasrullah, meaning that Nasrullah appears twice in the fourth generation of Alysheba's pedigree.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2100174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100174", "title": "Somniloquy", "text": "Somniloquy\n\nSomniloquy or sleep-talking is a parasomnia that refers to talking aloud while asleep. It can be quite loud, ranging from simple mumbling sounds to loud shouts and long, frequently inarticulate speeches, and can occur many times during a sleep cycle. As with sleepwalking and night terrors, sleeptalking usually occurs during delta-wave NREM sleep stages or during temporary arousals therefrom.\n\nIt can also occur during the REM sleep stage, at which time it represents what sleep therapists call a \"motor breakthrough\" (see sleep paralysis) of dream speech: words spoken in a dream are spoken out loud. Depending on its frequency, this may or may not be considered pathological. All motor functions are typically disabled during REM sleep thus, motoric, i.e., verbal elaboration of dream content, could be considered an REM behavior disorder (see below).\n\nSleep-talking can occur by itself (i.e., idiopathic) or as a feature of another sleep disorder such as:\n\nIn 1966, researchers worked to find links between heredity and somniloquy. Their research suggests the following:\n\n\nSleep-talking by itself is typically harmless; however, it can wake others and cause them consternation—especially when misinterpreted as conscious speech by an observer. If the sleep-talking is dramatic, emotional, or profane it may be a sign of another sleep disorder (see above). Sleep-talking can be monitored by a partner or by using an audio recording device; devices which remain idle until detecting a sound wave are ideal for this purpose. Polysomnography (sleep recording) shows episodes of sleep talking that can occur in any stage of sleep.\n\nStress can also cause sleep talking. Researchers have found than 30.7% of people who suffered from PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) talk in their sleep. Another study shows that Vietnam War veterans having PTSD report talking more in their sleep than non-PTSD patients. \n\nSomniloquy can also be caused by depression, sleep deprivation, day-time drowsiness, alcohol, and fever. It often occurs in association with other sleep disorders such as confusional arousals, sleep apnea, and REM sleep behavior disorder. In rare cases, adult-onset somniloquy is linked with a psychiatric disorder or nocturnal seizure.\n\nSleep-talking is very common and is reported in 50% of young children at least once a year. A large percentage of people progressively sleep-talk less often after the age of 25 while lot of people continue to talk in their sleep. And a sizable proportion of people without any episode during their childhood begin to sleep-talk in adult life. Somniloquy appears to run in families.\n\nIn a study reporting the prevalence of somniloquy in childhood, the authors reported that the frequency of somniloquy differs between children. About half of the children have sleep-talking episodes at least once a year but less than 10% of children present somniloquy every night whereas 20%-25% talk in their sleep at least once a week. In addition, they didn't find any difference between gender or socioeconomic class.\n\nHowever, valid estimation of the prevalence of this phenomenon is difficult as the sleep-talker either does not remember or are not aware of their sleep-talking. The same uncertainty exists concerning the age of onset because early occurrences may have escaped notice. Thus, we find disparate results regarding its prevalence in the literature.\n\nUsually, treatment is not required for somniloquy because it generally does not disturb sleep or cause other problems. But a behavioral treatment has already shown results in the past. Le Boeuf (1979) used an automated auditory signal to treat chronic sleep-talking in a patient suffering from sleep talking for 6 years. An aversive sound was produced for 5 seconds when the patient started talking in his sleep. Somniloquy was rapidly eliminated and the patient demonstrated no adverse effects of treatment.\n\nAlthough extremely rare, people who experience somniloquy may sometimes speak in another language. This phenomenon known only as \"different-language sleep-talk\", is currently under extensive research in numerous locations, though many are unknown, some are known to be located in New York City and San Diego inside the United States. This occurrence will most times be in a language that the person has obtained earlier on in one's life, although it is also possible to different-language sleep-talk a second language that one has learned later in one's childhood or pre-adulthood. It is impossible for someone experiencing different-language sleep-talk to speak in a language that he or she does not know or has not learned. The most common cases of people who experience different-language sleep-talk occur in teen to adulthood and will usually range anywhere between the ages of 17 to 26. Friends and family members of the one experiencing different-language sleep-talk should not awaken the person; they should instead consult him or her after they have awoken from their sleep and approach them on the issue. Much studying has yet to be completed on different-language sleep-talk, but for now, scientists can conclude that this case is non-harmful and is usually a byproduct of someone that sleep-talks on a regular basis.\n\nSleep-talking appears in Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\", the famous sleepwalking scene. Lady Macbeth, in a \"slumbery agitation,\" is observed by a gentlewoman and doctor to walk in her sleep and wash her hands, and utter the famous line, \"Out, damned spot! out, I say!\" (Act 5, Scene 1)\n\nSleep-talking also appears in \"The Childhood of King Erik Menved\", a 19th-century historical romance by Danish author Bernhard Severin Ingemann. In the story, a young girl named Aasé has the prophetic power of speaking the truth in her sleep. In an 1846 English translation, Aasé is described thus:\n\nShe is somewhat palefaced; and, however blithe and sprightly she may be, she is, nevertheless, now and then troubled with a kind of dreaming fit. But that will wear off as she gets older. Her mother was so troubled before her; and I believe it runs in the family as I am not entirely free from it myself. I do not give much heed to such dreaming now; but she has never yet said anything, while in this state, that has not proved in a manner true; though she can discern nothing, by night or day, more than others may do when they are in their senses.\n\nWalt Whitman wrote a now-lost novel based on Ingemann's romance, which he titled \"The Sleeptalker.\"\n\nIn Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventure's in Wonderland\", Chapter VII, The Dormouse talks in his sleep, or at least seems to, and even sings in his sleep:\n\n\n"}

It is both a registered charity, and a registered company (no. 122616).\n\nThe RBSA was established as the Birmingham Society of Artists in 1821, though it can trace its origins back further to the life drawing academy opened by Samuel Lines, Moses Haughton, Vincent Barber and Charles Barber in Peck Lane (now the site of New Street Station) in 1809. From this group was founded the Birmingham Academy of Arts in 1814, whose first exhibition was held that year. A gallery and set of offices for the Birmingham Society of Arts was built behind a fine neo-classical portico in New Street by architect Thomas Rickman in 1829. In 1868 the RBSA received its royal charter and adopted its current name.\n\nThe RBSA was to become a highly influential body in the later Victorian period, particularly within the Pre-Raphaelite and Arts and Crafts movements. Its members included some of the most significant figures in English art, and presidents during the period included artists of the stature of Edward Burne-Jones, William Morris, John Everett Millais and Lord Leighton. Members of the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists are entitled to use the post-nominal letters RBSA.\n\nOne of principal aims of the Society from its foundation had been to continue the educational activities pioneered by Lines. Initially this work was carried out by the society itself, but in 1843 the Birmingham School of Art was founded as a separate institution, falling under municipal control from 1877.\n\nIncreasing financial pressure in the early years of the 20th century led to the society's landmark New Street building being demolished and rebuilt as part of a commercial redevelopment, and in 2000 the society left the site completely, relocating to a converted warehouse near St Paul's Square in the Jewellery Quarter (). This is now known as the RBSA Gallery, and was opened by Charles, Prince of Wales, on 12 April 2000.\n\nThe two bronze plaques on its exterior, made in 1919, are the earliest known Birmingham works of William Bloye, later the society's president and Professor of Sculpture.\n\nIn 2014, the gallery celebrated its bicentenary since its first exhibition.

The substrates for the peptidyl transferase reaction are two tRNA molecules, one bearing the growing peptide chain and the other bearing the amino acid that will be added to the chain. The peptidyl chain and the amino acids are attached to their respective tRNAs via ester bonds to the O atom at the CCA-3' ends of these tRNAs. Peptidyl transferase is an enzyme that catalyzes the addition of amino acid residue in order to grow polypeptide chain in protein synthesis. It is located in the large ribosomal subunit, where it catalyzes the peptide bond formation. It is composed entirely of RNA. The alignment between the CCA ends of the ribosome-bound peptidyl tRNA and aminoacyl tRNA in the peptidyl transferase center contribute to its ability to catalyze these reactions. This reaction occurs via nucleophilic displacement. The amino group of the aminoacyl tRNA attacks the terminal carboxyl group of the peptidyl tRNA. Peptidyl transferase activity is carried out by the ribosome. Peptidyl transferase activity is not mediated by any ribosomal proteins but by ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a ribozyme. Ribozymes are the only enzymes which are not made up of proteins, but ribonucleotides. All other enzymes are made up of proteins. This RNA relic is the most significant piece of evidence supporting the RNA World hypothesis.\n\n\nPeptidyl transferases are not limited to translation, but there are relatively few enzymes with this function.\n\nPeptidyl transferase speeds up the reaction by lowering its energy of activation. It does this by providing proper orientation for the reaction to occur. The peptidyl transferase provides proximity, meaning that it brings thing closer together, but it does not provide an alternate mechanism. Instead, it provides proper substrate orientation, increasing the probability that the existing mechanism will occur.\n\nIn a ribosomal structure there are three binding sites which are P site, A site, and E site. The A site is the aminoacyl site because what comes into the A site is the aminoacyl tRNA. The structure contains an amino acid residue that is in an ester linkage attached to the A site and there is a free amine. In the P site, which is a peptidyl site, there is a tRNA that is attached. It's important to note that at the beginning of every cycle of Peptidyl Transferase you always start with a tRNA with a growing peptide chain in the P site. Once that occurs the aminoacyl tRNA can bind to the A site.\n\nIn regards to the mechanisms, the amine that is located in the A site is going to do a nucleophilic attack on the ester carbon in the P site. When the nucleophilic attack occurs, a tetrahedral intermediate will be created. In the active site of the peptidyl transferase, there is a water residue. When the tetrahedral intermediate is formed, the oxyanion now has a negative charge because the oxygen has one extra electron. The hydrogen on the water has a partial positive charge, which stabilizes the tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate. What will then occur is that the tetrahedral intermediate will collapse and lead to reformation of the carbonyl bond which results in the loss of the leaving group- that would be the P site ribose ring with the tRNA attached to it. With the release of the leaving group, the proton will be abstracted from the water which will lead to abstracting the proton from the two prime hydroxyl groups and the lone pairs will abstract the proton from the new amine of the amino acid. After the mechanism is complete, a non-acylated tRNA will remain in the P site and the entire growing polypeptide chain in addition to the extra amino acids are all attached in an ester linkage to the three prime hydroxyl groups of the tRNA in the A site.\n\nThe following protein synthesis inhibitors target peptidyl transferase:\n\n"}

It was first described as a species in 1796. Compared to other microbats, the big brown bat is relatively large, weighing and possessing a wingspan of . Big brown bats are insectivorous, consuming a diverse array of insects, particularly night-flying insects, but especially beetles. Some of the beetles it consumes are serious agricultural pests, including cucumber beetles. They are nocturnal, foraging for prey at night and roosting in sheltered areas during the day such as caves, tunnels, tree cavities, and human structures. Their breeding season is in the fall, shortly before their annual hibernation. After hibernation ends in the spring, females form maternity colonies for giving birth to young. Oftentimes only one offspring is produced per litter, though twins are common in the Eastern US. Lifespans of 6.5 years are considered average. \n\nThe big brown bat occurs widely throughout the US, Canada, Central America, and the Caribbean. Its range extends into parts of South America, found as far south as Colombia and Venezuela. It is adaptable to many habitats and is considered a generalist species. The big brown bat is not considered at risk for extinction, and is evaluated as the lowest conservation priority by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). While some other bat species in its range have experienced dramatic population declines due to the fungal disease white-nose syndrome, the big brown bat is relatively resistant to the effects of the disease, and some populations have even increased since the syndrome arrived in North America. Like all bats in the US, the big brown bat can be impacted by rabies, though some individuals have immunity against the virus. Even though sick bats are more likely to be submitted for testing, in 2011, only 3.8% of submitted big brown bats were positive for the rabies virus. Bat boxes are sometimes used to attract them as they are an agriculturally valuable species.\n\nThe big brown bat was described in 1796 by French naturalist Palisot de Beauvois. Palisot described the species based on specimens in the museum of Charles Willson Peale, an American naturalist, giving it the name \"Vespertila fuscus\". The genus name, \"Eptesicus\", is likely derived from the Greek words \"ptetikos\" (\"able to fly\") or \"petomai\" (\"house flier\"), and the species name \"\"fuscus\"\" is Latin in origin, meaning \"brown\". The big brown bat is the type species for the genus \"Eptesicus\", which was erected in 1820 by French-American naturalist Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. Though Rafinesque designated the type species as \"Eptesicus melanops\", this was later determined to be a synonym of \"Eptesicus fuscus\". The first use of the current name combination \"Eptesicus fuscus\" was in 1900 by Hungarian zoologist Lajos Méhelÿ. Recognized subspecies number eleven or twelve:\n\n\"E. f. lynni\" has sometimes been considered a full species, though was listed as a subspecies by the American Society of Mammalogists and the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) as of 2019. In the US state of Colorado where two subspecies were hypothesized to overlap (\"E. f. fuscus\" and \"E. f. pallidus\"), morphological features did not agree with genetic lineages, and thus were not reliable in distinguishing the two subspecies. Individuals with eastern and western US genetic lineages co-occurred in the same colonies, however.\n\nAs the genus \"Eptesicus\" is fairly speciose, it is further divided into morphologically similar \"species-groups\". The big brown bat belongs to the \"serotinus\" group, which is defined by having a large, elongate skull, flat braincase, and a long snout. In a study of the evolutionary relationships of some \"Eptesicus\" species, the big brown bat was most closely related to the two other species from the Americas: the Argentine brown bat and the diminutive serotine. The \"serotinus\" group also includes:\n\nIt is a relatively large microbat, weighing . Adult body length is . Its forearm is usually longer than . Its wingspan is . Its dorsal fur is reddish brown and glossy in appearance; ventral fur is lighter brown. Its snout, uropatagium (flight membrane between the hind limbs), and wing membranes are black and hairless. Its ears are also black; they are relatively short with rounded tips. The tragi (cartilage flaps in front of the ear canal) also have rounded tips. \n\nIt has a robust skull; the greatest length of the skull is approximately . The snout has a rounded and somewhat flattened appearance. The braincase has a breadth of approximately and the mandible (jawbone) has a length of approximately . The upper incisors are large, with the inner pair more prominent than the outer pair. The inner pair of upper incisors also has a distinctive secondary cusp. The crowns of the lower incisors are trifid, or have three cusps. Its dental formula is , for a total of 32 teeth.\n\nBig brown bats are insectivorous, eating many kinds of insects including beetles, flies, stone flies, mayflies, true bugs, net-winged insects, scorpionflies, caddisflies, and cockroaches. It will forage in cities around street lamps. As the big brown bat is such a widespread species, it has regional variation in its diet, though it is generally considered a beetle specialist. Populations in Indiana and Illinois have particularly high consumption of scarab beetles, cucumber beetles, ground beetles and shield bugs. In Oregon, primary prey items include moths in addition to scarab beetles and ground beetles. In British Columbia, large proportions of caddisflies are consumed, with flies as a secondary prey source. When being rehabilitated, big brown bats are often fed mealworms which have been supplemented with necessary vitamins and minerals.\n\nBig brown bats are significant predators of agricultural pests. A 1995 study found that, per year, a colony of 150 big brown bats in Indiana or Illinois consumes 600,000 cucumber beetles, 194,000 scarab beetles, 158,000 leafhoppers, and 335,000 shield bugsall of which cause serious agricultural damage.\n\nThe big brown bat is nocturnal, roosting in sheltered places during the day. It will utilize a wide variety of structures for roosts, including mines, caves, tunnels, buildings, bat boxes, tree cavities, storm drains, wood piles, and rock crevices. They generally roost in cavities, though they can sometimes be found under exfoliating bark. Both solitary males and solitary, non-pregnant/non-lactating females have been found roosting under bark.\n\nIn the summer, males are most often solitary, though they may form small, all-male colonies. Males will also sometimes roost with adult females. Females exhibit philopatry (\"love of place\"), with 10-30% of female offspring returning to their natal roost the following year and up to 72% of adult females using the same roost in subsequent years.\n\nBig brown bats enter into hibernation around November, often in a location less than away from their summer roosts. Big brown bats often hibernate by themselves, or in small groups. While some big brown bats hibernate in subterranean locations such as caves and underground mines, most can be found in warm man-made structures. Big brown bats tolerate cold weather fairly well, although they can be negatively affected by major changes in temperature. It is fairly common for some hibernating big brown bats to awaken temporarily and seek warmer shelter, locate water, and even mate. Big brown bats come out of hibernation in the spring.\n\nBig brown bat mating season is in the fall. After the breeding season, pregnant females separate into maternity colonies around April. Maternity colonies range in size from 5-700 individuals, though in the eastern US and Canada, they are frequently 25-75 adults. Historically, maternity colonies were probably in tree cavities. In modern, human-dominated landscapes, however, many maternity colonies are in buildings. In the eastern United States, twins are commonly born sometime between May and July; in western North America, females give birth to only one pup each year. A dissected female was once found with four embryos; had the female given birth, though, it is unlikely that all four would have survived. Like most species of bat, the big brown bat only has two nipples. At birth, pups are blind, helpless, and only , though they grow quickly, gaining up to per day. The pup nurses from its mother for approximately one month. Mothers leave their pups behind at the roost while they forage at night. Pups fledge, or begin flying, at three to five weeks old.\n\nA 2011 study of a population in Colorado found that their average life expectancy was a little over 6.5 years; according to a 2008 report, some banded big brown bats have lived up to 20 years, although some experts have hypothesized that the bats might be \"capable of living much longer.\" In general, males live longer than females.\n\nThe big brown bat has few natural predators. Depredation occurs opportunistically, with common grackles, American kestrels, owls, long-tailed weasels, and American bullfrogs as known predators. It is affected by a number of ectoparasites (external parasites) and endoparasites (internal parasites). Insect ectoparasites include \"Basilia\" (flies), \"Cimex\" (true bugs), and \"Myodopsylla\" (fleas). Several mites are ectoparasites as well, including \"Acanthopthirius\", \"Cheletonella\", \"Euschoengastia\", \"Leptotrombidium\", \"Macronyssus\", \"Neospeleognathopsis\", \"Neotrombicula\", \"Olabidocarpus\", \"Ornithodoros\", \"Parasecia\", \"Perissopalla\", and \"Spinturnix\". Endoparasites include nematodes, cestodes, and trematodes.\n\nLike all bats in the United States, big brown bats can be affected by rabies. The incubation period for rabies in this species can exceed four weeks, though the mean incubation period is 24 days. Rabid big brown bats will bite each other, which is the primary method of transmission from individual to individual. However, not all individuals will develop rabies after exposure to the virus. Some individuals have been observed with a sufficiently high rabies antibody concentration to confer immunity. Rabies immunity can be passed from mother to pup via passive immunity or from exposure to the bite of a rabid individual. Overall, a low proportion of big brown bats become infected with rabies. Populations of big brown bats in the Eastern United States have a different strain of rabies than the populations in the Western United States. In one study, only 10% of big brown bats were shedding the rabies virus through their saliva before exhibiting clinical symptoms of the disease; symptoms of rabies in big brown bats include acute weight loss, paralysis, ataxia (inability to coordinate muscle movement), paresis (weakness of voluntary movement), and unusual vocalizations.\n\nThe big brown bat is encountered widely throughout North America in present times. It is found from southern Canada and Alaska to as far south as Colombia and Venezuela. It has also been documented in the Caribbean in both the Greater and Lesser Antilles, including Hispaniola, Dominica, Barbados, and the Bahamas. The big brown bat has been documented from above sea level. It is a generalist, capable of living in urban, suburban, or rural environments. It has been called \"the most widespread Pleistocene bat in North America\", as it is more represented in the fossil record of that time than any other bat species. Its extensive fossil record is known from more than thirty sites, including fourteen US states, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and the Bahamas.\n\nThe big brown bat is evaluated at the lowest conservation priority by the IUCN—least concern. It meets the criteria for this designation because it has a wide geographic distribution, a large population size, occurrence in protected areas, and tolerance to habitat modification by humans. While other bat species in the Eastern United States have experienced significant population declines (up to 98% loss) due to white-nose syndrome, the big brown bat is relatively resistant to its effects. Even in caves harboring \"Pseudogymnoascus destructans\", the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome, big brown bats maintain normal torpor patterns. Unlike in other species more affected by white-nose syndrome, big brown bats are able to retain more of their body fat throughout hibernation. In fact, some regions of the eastern United States have seen an increase in big brown bat populations since the arrival of white-nose syndrome.\n\nBig brown bats are a species that will use bat houses for their roosts. Landowners will purchase or construct bat houses and install them, hoping to attract big brown bats, largely due to their being an \"agriculturally valuable species\". In particular, the big brown bat feeds on cucumber beetles, which can decimate corn; this makes the species quite beneficial to farmers in the Corn Belt.\n\nBig brown bats can be of concern to public health as a rabies vector, as they commonly roost in buildings and thus have a higher chance of encountering humans. Because they are often found in proximity to humans, the big brown bat and the not-closely related little brown bat are the two bat species most frequently submitted for rabies testing in the United States. Big brown bats infrequently test positive for the rabies virus; of the 8,273 individuals submitted for testing across the United States in 2011, 314 (3.8%) tested positive for the virus. There is a known bias in testing, however, as healthy bats rarely come into contact with humans, and therefore sick bats are more likely to be tested. In the US, human rabies cases from exposure to bats more frequently come from other bat species. Of the twenty-four human rabies cases from bats from 1993–2000, seventeen cases (71%) were a rabies variant associated with the silver-haired bat (\"Lasionycteris noctivagans\") while one case (4%) was associated with the rabies variant found in big brown bats.\n\n\"Histoplasma capsulatum\", the fungus that causes the disease histoplasmosis, is occasionally found in its guano. The big brown bat may also be a vector of the Saint Louis encephalitis virus, a mosquito-born virus that can affect humans. Individuals have also tested positive for \"West Nile virus\", which can also be transferred to humans via mosquitoes.\n\n"}

It went through a lengthy series of prototype versions, eventually evolving into a design that bore little resemblance to the P-40. None of these versions reached production.\n\nThe initial design contained in proposals to the United States Army Air Corps was for an aircraft based upon the P-40 design but featuring a low drag laminar flow wing, a Continental XIV-1430-3 inverted vee engine, and eight wing-mounted 0.5 in (12.7 mm) machine guns. This proposal was accepted and a contract for two prototypes was issued on 1 October 1940 with the aircraft designated the XP-53.\n\nWithin two months the Army Air Corps modified the contract to require the second prototype be completed with a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine in place of the XIV-1430. That aircraft was re-designated XP-60. The airframe design for the XP-60 was modified for the different engine, and the main landing gear was changed from the rearward-retracting P-40 design to a new inward retracting version, which allowed a wider wheelbase and a smooth wing surface when the gear was retracted. This aircraft first flew on 18 September 1941 with a British-built Merlin 28 engine. The XP-53 prototype was then converted into a static test airframe for the XP-60.\n\nConsidering delivery delays of quantities of the Packard-built Merlin engines due to its use in other fighters, the use of a turbo-supercharged Allison V-1710-75 engine was considered in its place. Consequently, on 31 October 1941, a contract for 1,900 P-60A fighters using the Allison engine, was awarded.\n\nIn the meantime, flight tests of the XP-60 prototype were not progressing smoothly. In addition to landing gear problems, expected top speed was not being met due to shortcomings in the laminar-flow wing surface finish, relatively high radiator drag (compared to the North American P-51 Mustang, which was then flying), and less than specified engine output performance. Consequently, work on the P-60A was stopped on 20 December 1941, when the USAAC recommended that Curtiss concentrate on licence production of Republic P-47 Thunderbolts.\n\nOn 2 January 1942, the order was changed to produce one XP-60A with the Allison V-1710-75 engine and a General Electric B-14 turbo-supercharger, one XP-60B with the Allison V-1710-75 engine and a Wright SU-504-1 turbo-supercharger, and one XP-60C with the massive Chrysler XIV-2220 sixteen cylinder inverted vee engine.\n\nAt the time, availability of the Chrysler engine was coming into question, and after Curtiss noted that several hundreds of pounds of lead would be needed in the tail of the existing airframe for balance, a decision was made to install a Pratt & Whitney R-2800 radial engine in the XP-60C. In the meantime, Curtiss installed a Merlin 61 engine in the original XP-60, and after enlarging the vertical tail surface this aircraft was redesignated XP-60D.\n\nThe XP-60A first flew on 1 November 1942. While official interest in the P-60 waned during summer 1942, interest due to the promise of improved performance with the installation of the R-2800 engine resulted in a contract for 500 R-2800 powered P-60A-1-CU fighters with contra-rotating propellers. With concern that the contra-rotating propellers would not be available on time, the XP-60B was modified to take the R-2800-10 engine driving a four-bladed propeller. This modification was redesignated XP-60E.\n\nOn 27 January 1943, the XP-60C flew for the first time, powered by an R-2800-53 engine with contra-rotating propellers. The aircraft's flying characteristics were found to be generally satisfactory. The first flight of the XP-60E with the four-bladed propeller was delayed until 26 May 1943 after it was found that due to its lighter weight, the engine installation had to be moved 10 inches forward compared to the XP-60C.\n\nIn April 1943, the US Army Air Forces decided to conduct an evaluation of the various fighter aircraft in development and use, in order to eliminate the least desirable models. Curtiss was requested to have the XP-60E participate. As the XP-60E was not available, the company hurriedly prepared the XP-60C for the evaluation at Patterson Field. In the event, due to various issues, the XP-60C performed poorly, resulting in reduction of the production run of 500 aircraft to two aircraft.\n\nIn January 1944, the XP-60E was flown to Eglin Field for official trials, where Army Air Force pilots found that it did not compare favorably to contemporary aircraft designs. When Curtiss expressed the desire to abandon further work on the P-60 series, the Army Air Forces insisted upon completion of one of the two aircraft in production. The aircraft when originally ordered was designated YP-60A-1-CU and was redesignated YP-60E. This aircraft flew on 13 July 1944 and was subsequently delivered to Wright Field. The YP-60E differed mainly from the XP-60E by being powered by a 2,100 hp (1,566 kW) R-2800-18 engine as well as the fitting of an all-around vision bubble canopy.\n\nWith the development contracts cancelled in June 1943, the program ended ignobly when the last prototype was scrapped on 22 December 1944. To replace the P-60, Curtiss built 354 Republic P-47Gs instead for the USAAF. The XP-60E survived to be sold as an entry for the 1947 National Air Races, but crashed during a qualifying flight before the competition was held.\n\n\n"}

The line, which is one of six in the Metro Rail system, entered service in 2003 and is operated by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro). The Gold Line serves 27 stations (including two subway stations).\n\nThe name of the line was changed from the Gold Line to the L Line in early 2020; however, the line in its current configuration will cease to exist when the Regional Connector is completed in 2022. At that point it will be split into two parts, with the northern half serving as an extension to the A Line (Blue) and the southern half serving as an extension to the E Line (Expo).\n\nBeginning in East Los Angeles, the Gold Line initially runs west toward Downtown Los Angeles. From its southern terminus at , the line travels west along 3rd Street to Indiana Street, where it turns north for two blocks to 1st Street. From here, the line continues west to Little Tokyo, partly through a tunnel under Boyle Heights with two underground stations. At Alameda Street in Little Tokyo, the line turns north and crosses over the Hollywood Freeway, and stops at Union Station on tracks 1 and 2. At Union Station, riders can connect with the Metro Red and Metro Purple Subway Lines, the Metro Silver Line bus rapid transit line as well as several other Metro (MTA) bus lines, LADOT Dash lines, Metrolink regional commuter trains, and Amtrak services including Pacific Surfliner and long distance interstate trains, and Amtrak throughway motorcoaches connecting to San Joaquin trains originating at Bakersfield.\n\nFrom Union Station, the Gold Line proceeds north on elevated rail to Chinatown and then crosses the Los Angeles River adjacent to the Golden State Freeway (Interstate 5). From here, the route continues north/northeast, serving the hillside communities north of downtown, including Lincoln Heights, Mount Washington and Highland Park. Through this stretch, the Gold Line operates primarily at grade, except for a short underpass below Figueroa Street.\n\nNorth of Highland Park, the route crosses over the Arroyo Seco Parkway (State Route 110). The route continues through South Pasadena and then downtown Pasadena, primarily at-grade. In Old Pasadena, the line travels underground for almost half a mile long, passing under Pasadena's main thoroughfare, Colorado Boulevard. ( station, just north of Colorado Boulevard, is below grade.) Finally, the Gold Line enters the median of the Foothill Freeway (Interstate 210) and continues east to station, in Pasadena just west of the Arcadia city limits.\n\nEast of Pasadena, the route crosses over the eastbound lanes of Foothill Freeway (Interstate 210) west of Santa Anita Avenue, with stops at the Arcadia Station, located at the corner of First Avenue and Santa Clara Street, then it crosses over Huntington Drive and stops at the Monrovia Station, north of Duarte Road at Myrtle Avenue. It continues eastbound with a stop at the Duarte/City of Hope Station located at the north side of Duarte Road, across the street from the City of Hope Medical Center, then continues going over the San Gabriel River and stops at the Irwindale Station at Irwindale Avenue, continues over the Foothill Freeway (Interstate 210) over Foothill Boulevard and stops at the Azusa Station at Azusa Avenue, north of Foothill Boulevard, and its terminus is at the APU/Citrus College Station just west of Citrus Avenue.\n\nMetro Gold Line trains operate between 3:45 a.m. and 12:45 a.m. daily. (til 2:00 am Friday and Saturday nights)\n\nTrains on the Gold Line operate every 7 minutes during peak hours Monday through Friday. Middays consist of 12–18 minute headways, while weekends all day have a frequency of 12–18 minutes. Nighttime service operates every 20 minutes.\n\nThe Gold Line trains travel at a maximum speed of 55 mph. It takes 73 minutes to travel its length, at an average speed of over its length. The Gold Line is particularly slow through the Highland Park and Little Tokyo areas, where trains reach speeds of only due to several street crossings and through the curves, where trains travel at about .\n\nFollowing the extension to East Los Angeles in 2009, the line's ridership increased to almost 30,000 daily boardings. , the average weekday daily boardings for the Gold Line stood at 42,417 and the average daily weekday boardings had increased to 44,707. Following the extension to Azusa, ridership rose to 49,238 as of May 2016.\n\nMuch of the Gold Line's current right-of-way through the San Gabriel Valley was originally built by the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad in 1885, eventually taken over by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, as part of the Pasadena Subdivision, which saw Amtrak service into the early 1990s. This segment was part of the original plan for the Metro Blue Line, but when a ban on sales tax spending on subway tunnels passed in 1998, the project became a separate line terminating at Union Station.\n\nThe original Gold Line, between Union Station and Sierra Madre Villa, opened July 26, 2003.\n\nThe Gold Line Eastside Extension, a separate segment following all new right-of-way extending east from Union Station to East Los Angeles, opened on November 15, 2009.\n\nThe first stage of the Gold Line Foothill Extension, running from Sierra Madre Villa station in Pasadena to APU/Citrus College station in Azusa, opened on March 5, 2016.\n\nThe Regional Connector is an under-construction light rail subway corridor through Downtown Los Angeles.

By then, this extension will become part of the A Line.\n\nMetro is considering a new extension of the Metro Gold Line in the Eastside. This second phase of the Eastside Corridor would extend the Gold Line's southern leg eastward, from its current terminus at Atlantic station to Whittier.\n\nAs of August 2010, Metro has completed the Alternatives Analysis phase. The next step for Metro is to conduct an initial environmental study, leading to publication and approval of a Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR).\n\nThe two alignments to be studied in the DEIR are:\n\n\nThe following table lists the current stations of the Gold Line, from south to north.\n\nThe Gold Line is operated in both the Division 21 Yard (Los Angeles River Yard) and Division 24 yard (Monrovia yard). Division 21 is located on Vin Scully Drive (Elysian Park Drive) just north of North Broadway, overlooking the Los Angeles River, and Division 24 is located south of the I-210 freeway in Monrovia. These yards stores the fleet used on the Gold Line. It is also where maintenance is done on the fleet. Trains can access these yards via a single track junction.\n\nGold Line trains are typically two-car trains. During peak hours on weekdays, some three-car trains run. On New Year's Day, the Gold Line uses three-car trains for service to the Tournament of Roses Parade and the Rose Bowl Game. Service operates from approximately 4 am to 1 am, with service approximately every 7 minutes during peak hours, 12 minutes middays and on weekends and 20 minutes until the close of service.\n\nTrains are composed of articulated light rail vehicles (LRVs) which are compatible with Metro's light rail lines. As of April 2012, the Gold Line uses 50 AnsaldoBreda P2550 LRVs, and it was the first of the Metro light rail lines to introduce the Kinkisharyo P3010 LRVs into service.\n\nIn April 2012, Metro transferred the last of the Gold Line's Siemens P2000 trains to the Blue Line and Expo Line.\n\nOn December 21, 2007, Metro introduced cars 233 and 235, which are the special commemorative trains for the 119th Tournament of Roses Parade and the 94th Rose Bowl Game. These are known as the 2008 \"Tournament Train\".\n\nOn October 3, 2007, Metro Gold Line trains began having advertisement banners on the sides of trains, like on the Metro Green Line. On February 13, 2008, Metro removed the banner ads on all Metro Gold Line trains. But in mid-June 2008, banners promoting the Long Range Transportation Plan were added on car 246. On July 14, 2008, banner ads were added on cars 229, 235, 236, 238, 239, 244, 250 and 302.\n\nThe following noteworthy incidents have occurred on the Gold Line since opening.\n\n\n"}

His subtle fragrance Eau de Cologne became rapidly famous worldwide and in the 18th century was an indispensable accessory at all royal courts. The perfume maker chose to call his perfume after his new home town so as to honour it. Indeed, at the time when Farina first moved to Cologne, there were very strict laws regarding foreign settlers. Farina was granted citizenship and, in order to show off his gratitude, he named his very first creation \"Eau de Cologne\" (lit. French: \"Water of Cologne\"). This perfume, being a real sensation at the time, contributed to Cologne’s global fame.\n\nBeing the very first perfume of its kind on the market, the word \"Cologne\" quickly became a household name.\n\n\"Cologne\" refers to a perfume which is usually refreshingly light, unisex with a citrus-based head note.\n\nThe explanation as to why the perfume was given a French name is rather simple: In the 17th and 18th century, the French language was spoken in European high society and also used by tradesmen, which explains Farina's name decision. Counterfeits of the perfume only appeared at the end of the 18th century. After the French Revolution, Napoleon's troops occupied Cologne for a number of years and introduced freedom of trade. Back then, registered trademarks did not exist, which explains why there were so many counterfeits.\n\nFarina died on 25 November 1766 in Cologne. Today the 8th generation of the Farina family still produces the original Eau de Cologne.\n\n"}

It was originally used only for special events at nearby Gillette Stadium, primarily New England Patriots games, but now has weekday service on a pilot basis to test demand. It lies on a freight line between Mansfield and Framingham, known as the Framingham Secondary. The line was part of the Boston, Clinton, Fitchburg and New Bedford Railroad, Old Colony Railroad, New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, Penn Central, and, finally, Conrail, until 1999, when it passed to CSX.

The study looked at extending some Fairmount Line service to Foxboro, running shuttle trains from Foxboro to Walpole, or a combination of both. No determination was made as to if or when this service would begin.\n\nA proposal for the MBTA to purchase the track and restore full service met with some local opposition, although the state purchased the line in June 2015. Passenger service gained new momentum when Robert Kraft, the owner of Gillette Stadium, agreed to help subsidize the costs of a pilot program, up to $200,000/year.\n\nIn August 2017, the MBTA Fiscal Board approved an 11-month pilot program to test commuter rail service to Foxborough, with service planned to begin sometime in late 2018 or early 2019. In October 2017, the MBTA indicated that service would begin on May 20, 2019. Service during the trial period will consist of seven daily round trips - three during the morning peak period, three in the evening peak, and one midday.

{"id": "2100287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100287", "title": "Ethel Snowden", "text": "Ethel Snowden\n\nEthel Snowden, Viscountess Snowden (born Ethel Annakin; 8 September 1881 – 22 February 1951), was a British socialist, human rights activist, and feminist politician. From a middle-class background, she became a Christian Socialist through a radical preacher and initially promoted temperance and teetotalism in the slums of Liverpool. She aligned to the Fabian Society and later the Independent Labour Party, earning an income by lecturing in Britain and abroad. Snowden was one of the leading campaigners for women's suffrage before the First World War, then founding The Women's Peace Crusade to oppose the war and call for a negotiated peace. After a visit to the Soviet Union she developed a strong criticism of its system, which made her unpopular when relayed to the left-wing in Britain.\n\nSnowden married the prominent Labour Party politician and future Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Snowden. She rose up the social scale in the 1920s, much to her pleasure, and she welcomed appointment as a Governor of the BBC and as a Director of the Royal Opera House. Although her husband received a Viscountcy, money became tight and she led the way in caring for him; after his death, she resumed temperance campaigning as well as journalism. She tended to be a controversial public speaker, who would fill with enthusiasm for a project and pursue it to the disregard of anything that stood in her way; it was said of her that \"tact or discretion were foreign to her nature\".\n\nEthel Annakin was the daughter of Richard Annakin, a building contractor. Her father also became involved in politics and later served as Alderman of Harrogate, becoming Mayor of the town in 1930–31. She is described by Philip Snowden's biographer Colin Cross as a \"woman of strong will and striking good looks\". She trained as a teacher at Edge Hill College in Liverpool, and while there joined the congregation of radical preacher Rev Dr C.F. Aked; after listening to his sermon on \"Can a Man be a Christian on £1 a week?\" she became a socialist and joined with Aked's social work in the slums of Liverpool promoting teetotalism. She also joined the Fabian Society.\n\nAccording to her future husband, the Labour politician Philip Snowden, they had met at a Fabian meeting in Leeds probably in about 1903, although Mary Agnes Hamilton thought they met at the Bradford house of William and Martha Leach. Harrogate, a spa town not dependent on the milling industry, was regarded as a higher class area and it was rare for someone of Ethel's background to be a socialist. She took her first lecture on behalf of the Yorkshire Independent Labour Party at Keighley Labour Institute in September 1903, possibly arranged by Snowden. In 1904 she started working as a schoolteacher at Walverden School in Nelson, Lancashire which was only 9 miles from Snowden's home at Cowling, and became a regular visitor, although Philip Snowden's mother Martha could not abide to meet her, thinking her pretentious and patronising.\n\nA story told within the ILP and generally believed was that Ethel had proposed to Philip, which was against the marriage customs of the time. They had a quiet wedding with few guests at the registry office in Otley on 13 March 1905, with Philip Snowden explaining that they had learned that their socialist friends in the West Riding were planning a 'Socialist demonstration' at what they were hoping would be a family celebration. It is also thought that both families were opposed, and Philip Snowden did not tell his mother until he sent a telegram after the marriage had taken place. There was no honeymoon. Snowden subsequently tried to make friends with Martha but never entirely succeeded, with Martha frequently criticising her for concentrating on her own political career to the detriment of looking after her husband (who had long-term mobility difficulties).\n\nEthel and Philip Snowden set up home at Spencer Place in Leeds, and Ethel began to earn an income from lecture fees. She was interviewed for the woman's page of the \"Blackburn Weekly Telegraph\" where her husband was Prospective Parliamentary Candidate, telling the paper that \"Our great motto .. is liberty, equality of opportunity and fraternity. Our great principle is love\". She lectured in South Wales on socialism and women's suffrage in autumn 1905, but was ill during the 1906 election campaign and unable to help Philip in his successful election contest in Blackburn. She undertook a successful lecture tour of the United States in 1907, possibly arranged through Dr Aked who was then in New York; the tour was successful as American audiences seemed to like her way of speaking. The Snowdens gave up their Leeds home during this tour and moved to Baron's Court Road in west London.\n\nAfter 1906 Snowden became increasingly active in supporting women's suffrage, being one of the national speakers for the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies; she decried the concentration on such things as dresses, jewels and cake recipes and wrote a book called \"The Woman Socialist\" in 1907 which advocated state control of marriage, joint title by women to the housekeeping money, and a state salary for mothers; she also wanted housekeeping organised collectively in each street and declared that under socialism women would have \"no need to paint face and tint hair\". Her strong views seemed to influence her husband, although Snowden was always a 'suffragist' and never endorsed the violent tactics of the suffragettes.\nDuring a 1910 trip to the United States, Ethel Snowden was interviewed and sketched by Marguerite Martyn of the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch.\" During the interview, Snowden mocked anti-suffrage parliamentarian Rowland Baring, 2nd Earl of Cromer, by affecting an accent and, as Martyn put it:\n\nStanding stiffly as if suffering from a choking parliamentary collar, adjusting an imaginary monocle, producing imaginary notes from an imaginary Prince Albert coat pocket, clearing her throat and \"er-ing\" and \"aw-ing\" prodigiously, Mrs. Snowden proved herself an accomplished mimic and actress. [Adjacent image.]\n\nIn 1914 Ethel Snowden was speaking at 200 public meetings a year on the subject, and temporarily resigned from the Independent Labour Party in order that her political allegiance did not cause problems with her campaigning on the issue.\n\nThe Snowdens left Britain for a long, world-wide, lecture tour in July 1914; while they were in Canada, news came of the outbreak of war. Philip Snowden asked whether he should return but was told not to, possibly because of his known pacifism which Ethel shared. While in Portland, Oregon Ethel gave an interview which produced a headline reading \"Briton M.P. advises British Soldiers to Shoot Their Officers\" which her husband considered damaging. She was near to being a complete pacifist, and joined her husband in campaigning for a negotiated peace in 1916. In 1917 she became the organiser and principal speaker for the Women's Peace Crusade, estimating that she had addressed half a million people in the last year of the war; her main campaign speech was an appeal for men to \"love\" one another.\n\nAt the end of the war, Snowden was elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party in its Women's Section. This position made her a very prominent figure within the left-wing movements and led to a great deal of foreign travel, including to Berne and Vienna (to try to re-establish the Socialist International), Palestine, Georgia and twice to the United States. Most notably, she was named to a joint TUC-Labour Party delegation to Russia in early 1920 which was sent to be an impartial inquiry into the Bolshevik Revolution. After her return she published a book, \"Through Bolshevik Russia\", which revealed her own findings. Although she liked Lenin (\"the merry-eyed fanatic of the Kremlin\"), her general reaction was profoundly critical. She upbraided a Bolshevik who told a public meeting that a British revolution would start in three months, insisting that \"we want power, but we do not want a revolution\", and observed that \"Everyone I met in Russia outside the Communist Party goes in terror of his liberty or his life\". She had told a reporter for the \"Evening Standard\" on her return that \"I oppose Bolshevism because it is not Socialism, it is not democracy and it is not Christianity\", and likened working conditions to slavery.\n\nSnowden's denunciations of the Soviets made her unpopular with the left within the Labour movement and resulted in her being voted off the National Executive Committee in 1922. Her prominence led to invitations to stand for Parliament. Snowden refused to stand in Plymouth Devonport against Lady Astor on grounds that Astor's service was invaluable. She was selected at one point as Labour Party candidate for Leicester East, but gave up the candidature when a by-election was called there in Spring 1922 (the Labour candidate won).\n\nWith Philip Snowden back in Parliament for Colne Valley in 1922 and Labour as the official opposition, Lord and Lady Astor arranged a dinner party where King George V and Queen Mary could meet Labour leaders Snowden, J. R. Clynes, James Henry Thomas and their wives. Snowden became firm friends with Queen Mary. The couple put together all their earnings and savings in 1923 to buy a country house of ten rooms, Eden Lodge, set in an acre of land at Tilford in Surrey. Above her mantelpiece in the drawing room at Eden Lodge were later placed signed photographs of the King and Queen. They sold their London home at Golders Green and took a flat near Parliament in St Ermine's Court, but Ethel was angry when her husband was not allocated the living quarters at 11 Downing Street on becoming Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1924.The Snowdens did not generally host parties, partly because they were both hard workers, but did like to meet up with old friends. They enjoyed music and Ethel was a good pianist. She started a rivalry with Beatrice Webb for the position of the leader among the Labour ministers' wives. After the fall of the Labour government, Ethel Snowden toured Canada and criticised Ramsay MacDonald's leadership in public speeches which were widely reported back in Britain and assumed to be the views of her husband. Although later moderating her language, she stood by her words when questioned by reporters on her return.\n\nConservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin appointed Ethel Snowden a governor of the newly established British Broadcasting Corporation in 1926, as a representative of women and of Labour; the appointment carried an annual salary of £750. She quarrelled with Sir John Reith at her first meeting and they continued to feud throughout her term, with Reith trying to get rid of her. Snowden was given the credit for the fact that no alcoholic drinks could be found in the newly built Broadcasting House, and she appeared to confirm her responsibility for this state of affairs. When the Labour government was formed in 1929, the Snowdens finally moved to 11 Downing Street, where they found that the cost of employing eight servants and official entertaining required dipping into their savings. While no alcoholic drink was served, Ethel hosted many tea parties and evening receptions with musical and artistic guests (some in the Labour Party noted that few MPs or even other Ministers had been invited). She seems to have persuaded her husband to give an Exchequer grant to support the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden, and became a director of the new company formed to manage it.\n\nPhilip Snowden was seriously ill in early 1931, and apparently decided not to stand again for Parliament but to go to the House of Lords. He confirmed his decision to stand down in August, shortly before the collapse of the Labour Government, and was not a candidate in the general election although playing an active part in the campaign. When the award of a Viscountcy was announced in the Dissolution Honours List, Ramsay MacDonald was reported to have said that Snowden's desire for a Peerage came from his wife. Ethel became Viscountess Snowden on 24 November 1931.\n\nThe Snowdens found their financial position gradually eroding after 1931. Ethel's five-year appointment at the BBC expired at the end of 1931 and was renewed for only one year, but after Philip Snowden resigned from office over the principle of free trade that was their only regular income. When the appointment came up again, MacDonald did not renew it, a move was ascribed to personal spite. The Snowdens had to fund Eden Lodge, a London flat, and the costs of caring for Philip, who now needed constant medical attention. Philip Snowden turned back to journalism, penning increasingly bitter attacks on MacDonald. By 1936 he was immobile and being cared for by Ethel and some nurses whom she supervised at Eden Lodge; he continued to keep up with politics. Ethel attended the Coronation ceremonies of 12 May 1937 without him; Philip died three days later. She had him cremated at Woking, and the ashes scattered on the open moor at Ickornshaw above his birthplace; his books were given to Keighley Public Libraries where they formed the 'Viscount Snowden Memorial Library'. She destroyed his remaining papers.\n\nViscountess Snowden moved to a flat in Dolphin Square, disliking visiting Eden Lodge which was used by an evacuated Government office during the Second World War. She attempted unsuccessfully to get reappointed as a BBC governor and in 1937 visited the Nuremberg Rally, writing for the \"Sunday Chronicle\" to criticise other British people present for refusing to give the salute and to say that she found Hitler \"a simple man of great personal integrity\" of whom \"I would not hesitate to accept his word\". Her other journalism made a strong defence of her husband; it was said that the quickest way to win her favour was to praise Philip. She entertained Queen Mary to tea at Dolphin Square in 1938, and became President of the Band of Hope, the leading Christian temperance organisation, in May 1939. When war did break out, she supported it and expressed the view that Nazis were utterly evil, but she had reservations about area bombing. In August 1943 she denounced the BBC for poor moral standards in regard to drinking, swearing, and marital fidelity; she was nevertheless invited to appear as a panellist on \"The Brains Trust\".\n\nSnowden suffered a severe stroke in 1947 which left her disabled and permanently resident in the Warleigh Nursing Home in Wimbledon, although her mind remained active. She sent a letter of support to Conservative Party candidate Cyril Black, a teetotaller, in Wimbledon at the 1950 general election. Her father died that year at the age of 93, and she outlived him by only a few months, dying aged 69. Her will was worth £23,279, the majority being the money she had earned in her early career. After cremation her ashes were scattered on the same moor as her husband. Her collection of books is now in nearby Silsden library.\n\nThere is a Halls of Residence called Snowden at Edge Hill University in her honour.\n\n\n\nNotes\nCitations\nBibliography\n"}

The planet is being attacked by meteorite showers orchestrated by an unknown enemy responsible for the disappearance of several prominent colonists, including the colony's leader, Captain Revere. After witnessing Revere being \"eaten by the ground,\" Security Chief Brazen claims Revere died of natural causes. Revere's son, Plantagenet, assumes the leadership of the colony.\n\nThe TARDIS is dragged down to the planet by gravity. The Fifth Doctor, Tegan and Turlough emerge, in the middle of the bombardment, to investigate. Despite his earlier reservations about getting involved, the Doctor violates the cardinal rule of the Time Lords by helping the colonists who were injured by providing medical assistance.\n\nNeeding better light in the medical facility, the Doctor sends Tegan and Turlough to fetch equipment from the TARDIS. However, once they arrive, they find that the ship's inner door is stuck, preventing them from getting beyond the console room. Norna, Tegan and Turlough obtain an acid-battery from the research room to power the lights. On their way back, however, they are forced to render the Warnsman unconscious to avoid capture. Another bombardment occurs and, in the Warnsman's absence, catches the colony unaware. When the skies clear, the TARDIS is seemingly destroyed; all that is left is the Doctor's hat stand.\n\nPlantagenet orders the execution of the Doctor, but Turlough intercedes, brandishing the TARDIS hat stand which the settlers take to be a formidable weapon. Plantagenet tries to attack the Doctor with a crowbar but suffers a heart attack. The Time Lord manages to save his life using the battery, but Plantagenet is later dragged into the ground by some mysterious force.\n\nThe Doctor, Tegan and Turlough discover that the culprits are the Gravis and his Tractators, giant insects with incredible powers over gravity. Turlough briefly undergoes a nervous breakdown because the Tractators once attempted to invade his home world long ago; his mind contains a deep, horrific \"race memory\" of the event. The disappearing colonists are being used by the Tractators to run their mining machines. Plantagenet was kidnapped to replace Captain Revere, the current driver who is now brain dead. The Gravis intends to transform Frontios into an enormous spaceship. Once successful, he would be able to spread the terror of the Tractators across the galaxy. The Doctor, Turlough, Brazen and his guards rescue Plantagenet by knocking out the Gravis. However, Brazen is caught by one of the mining machines and killed while the others escape.\n\nTegan wanders around in the tunnels and comes across bits of the TARDIS's inner walls. She is chased by the Gravis, who has now regained consciousness, and two of his Tractators. She comes upon one of the TARDIS's inner doors and opens it, only to find herself in the TARDIS console room, which has bits of rock wall mixed in with its normal walls. She also finds the Doctor, Turlough and Plantagenet congregated around the console. The Doctor ushers the Gravis in and then tricks him into reassembling the TARDIS by using his power over gravity. The Gravis pulls the TARDIS back into its normal dimension. Once fully assembled, the Gravis is effectively cut off from his fellow Tractators, which revert to a harmless state.\n\nThe Doctor and Tegan deposit the now-dormant Gravis on the uninhabited planet of Kolkokron. Returning to Frontios, the Doctor gives Plantagenet the hat stand as a farewell token and asks that his own involvement in the affair not be mentioned to anyone, especially the Time Lords. Once the TARDIS has left Frontios, its engines start making a worrisome noise. The Doctor appears to be helpless as the ship is being pulled towards the centre of the universe.\n\nScript editor Eric Saward contacted writer Christopher H. Bidmead in July 1982 with a view to writing a script. Its original title was \"The Wanderer[s]\". The scripts were formally commissioned on 26 November 1982 under the title \"Frontious\". The scripts were delivered on 16 February 1983 and accepted three weeks later subject to some rewrites. The director was Ron Jones, who had directed three earlier Fifth Doctor stories. The designer assigned to the serial, Barrie Dobbins died before production (later revealed as suicide) and was replaced by David Buckingham. He started on production on 8 July 1983, just six weeks before recording. Soon after this, another shock came to the production when actor Peter Arne, who had been hired to play Mr Range, was murdered on 1 August 1983. This was just hours after he had attended a costume fitting for his character at the BBC. His murder was reported widely in the British media the following day, with many reports making mention of his upcoming part in \"Doctor Who\". He was replaced by William Lucas. Other actors of note featured in \"Frontios\" included Peter Gilmore (as Brazen), who had found fame during the 1970s in the lead role of \"The Onedin Line\". Lesley Dunlop, playing Norna, was widely experienced, despite her being just 27 and went on to appear in \"Doctor Who\" again, in 1988's \"The Happiness Patrol\". Jeff Rawle had also found fame in the 1970s as \"Billy Liar\" and later starred in \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\" story \"Mona Lisa's Revenge\". It was during rehearsals for this story that Colin Baker was announced as the new actor, as Peter Davison had by this time decided to leave the show. \"Frontios\" was filmed in two three-day recording blocks in the BBC Television Centre's Studio 6 from 24 August to 9 September 1983.\n\nBidmead was instructed to include a monster in the script, something he was unhappy with since he felt that the \"Doctor Who\" monsters looked \"cheap\" and had limited dialogue. His two earlier stories, \"Logopolis\" and \"Castrovalva\" featured no monsters. The Tractators were inspired by woodlice, which had infested his flat. Dancers were hired to wear the Tractator costumes with the idea that they would coil and twist their bodies in line with the idea of woodlice, but the costumes were too restrictive for this. The dancers were hired from Pineapple Studios. One glitch in the continuity of the series occurs in this story, as companion Kamelion is missing when the TARDIS is destroyed. The writers of \"The Discontinuity Guide\" theorise that he is disguised as the hatstand.\n\nSoon after the story was broadcast, Saward commissioned Bidmead to write a story for Season 23 featuring the Tractators and the Master.

{"id": "2100317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100317", "title": "White van speaker scam", "text": "White van speaker scam\n\nThe white van speaker scam is a scam sales technique in which a con artist makes a buyer believe they are getting a good price on home entertainment products. Often a con artist will buy generic speakers worth around $40 and convince potential buyers that they are premium products worth over $2,000, offering them for sale at around $500. Con artists in this type of scam call themselves \"speakerguys\" or \"speakermen\", and usually claim to be working for a speaker delivery or installation company.\n\nThe speaker scam was common in the 1980s and is believed to be the origin of the use of the term \"high-end\", and despite widespread information about the scam on consumer forums and watchdog sites, the scams continue operating across several continents.\n\nThe typical white van speaker scam involves one to three individuals, who are usually casually dressed or wearing uniforms. They drive an SUV, minivan or a commercial vehicle (usually a white commercial van, which may be rented inexpensively) that often displays a company logo. To find suitable targets, the van operators set up their con in moderately trafficked areas, such as parking lots, gas stations, colleges, or large apartment complexes. Alternatively, they may target people driving expensive cars and wave them down. The marks (victims) are usually affluent, young people, college students, or others thought to have large amounts of disposable income. The marks may also be foreigners or people who are unfamiliar with typical business transactions in Western countries.\n\nThe operators often claim that they work for an audio retailer or audio installer and that, through some sort of corporate error (warehouse operator mistake, bookkeeping mistakes, computer glitch, etc.) or due to the client changing the order after supplies were purchased, they have extra speakers. Sometimes, it is implied that the merchandise may be stolen. For varying reasons they need to dispose of the speakers quickly and are willing to get rid of them at \"well below retail\" prices. The con artists will repeatedly state the speaker's \"value\" as anywhere between $1800 and $3500, prices often purportedly verified by showing a website, brochure or a magazine advertisement. Speakers are often given a fictional brand name, sometimes intentionally similar to a well-regarded speaker manufacturer in order to mislead the buyer. Some of these fictional brands have reputable-looking websites which list customer service telephone numbers and support e-mail addresses, but these methods of contact are often dead ends.\n\nIf the mark declines the offer, the scammer uses various high-pressure negotiation sales tactics. Among these techniques are producing glossy material that details the quality and high retail value of the speakers, and bombarding the potential customer with technical jargon, whether correctly or incorrectly used. If still unable to convince the mark that he or she would be turning down an incredible offer, the con artist will almost always lower the price significantly.\n\nOverall, the quality of the product is inferior. In some cases when a buyer tries to hook up the home theatre system to a high definition television set, they find that it cannot be done, and the claim of HD compatibility made for the white van system is just another element of the scam. Systems (typically amplifiers with speakers, sold as sets) with only two or three inputs and a lack of video inputs, with only analogue L/R/6ch RCA jacks, are common in this scheme.\n\nDespite the age of the scam and its dubious legality, white van scams often have relatively sophisticated logistics. Distributors rent a warehouse and obtain licenses and distribution rights, then import large quantities of poorly made goods. They ship these goods to local warehouses in major cities and hire 'salesmen' to distribute the shoddy goods.\n\nIn the United States and Canada distribution is often in major cities. The marketers at each office establish a promotion, benefit, and bonus scale for the speaker sales teams. Bonuses may be paid in cash, checks, fake credit cards or speakers.\n\nIn Australia the same tactic is used. Receipts are issued, but the contact details are usually fake so that the goods cannot be returned. As an added measure, vehicles are leased so that they cannot be traced to either the distributor or 'sales person' driving.\n\nIn more recent versions, the white van speaker scam has turned into an electronic product sold on second-hand goods websites. The most notable example features video projectors (sometimes accompanied with a projection screen or speakers). Scammers create a website for their created brand so it will be referenced by search engines and thereby build credibility around their scam product. As usual, the product is sold at a much lower price - as much as 1/10th that of the putative retail price. \n\nThe latest variety of the white van scam was observed around \"commercial grade\" trampolines on eBay, Craigslist and other classified sites. They are typically listed as refurbished or like-new with a story about why they are so deeply discounted and need to be sold so fast, often referencing a poorly made, fake vendor website with listed prices. These list prices are significantly higher than comparable premium products to give the illusion that the trampoline is a step up over regular \"consumer grade\" trampolines. Googling brands and models often leads to completely unrelated products via Google AdWords or consumer reviews on competing products, often placed there by the scammers themselves. Ironically, safety is often highlighted on these scam listings whereas the actual origin of the product is unknown hence its safety is also questionable.\n\n"}

Had this mission and spacecraft been launched, it would have been designated Pioneer 12; that designation was later applied to the Pioneer Venus Orbiter.\n\nAs planning for the Pioneer 10 and 11 missions progressed, mission scientists found themselves desiring a third probe. In 1971, a formal mission study was proposed for a spacecraft to be launched to Jupiter in 1974, where it would use the gas giant as a gravitational slingshot to travel outside the ecliptic. This was the first Out-Of-The-Ecliptic mission (OOE) proposed, for Jupiter and solar (Sun) observations.\n\nNASA/Ames Research Center would have managed the project. The NASA contractor TRW Systems Group (formerly Space Technology Laboratories) would have constructed Pioneer H from the flight-qualified spare components intended for the Pioneer F and G probes (designated Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 after launch).\nNASA management did not approve the mission proposal, and it was never launched in 1974. In 1976 NASA transferred the craft (without RTG) to the Smithsonian Institution. In January 1977, Pioneer H was moved to the National Air and Space Museum, where it was eventually displayed as a replica of Pioneer 10.\n\nThe Pioneer H mission concept was finally realized with the Ulysses mission, which achieved the OOE orbit originally envisioned for Pioneer H. The Juno mission, currently at Jupiter in a polar orbit, is taking the magnetometer observations of Jupiter's poles that Pioneer H would have performed.\n\nPioneer H hangs in the Milestones of Flight Gallery at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., serving as a stand-in for the Pioneer 10 probe.\n\nWhile described in official Smithsonian records as a \"replica\", the spacecraft was considered fully functional by Pioneer mission planners (though its RTGs were never installed). Mark Wolverton quotes James Van Allen in \"The Depths of Space\":\n\nWe mounted an intensive campaign to launch the flight-worthy spare spacecraft and its instrument complement on a low-cost, out-of-ecliptic mission via a high-inclination flyby of Jupiter. However, our case fell on deaf ears at NASA headquarters, and the spare spacecraft now hangs in the main gallery of the National Air and Space Museum, at 1 AU and zero ecliptic latitude.\n\n"}

XEWT's over-the-air signal also covers the San Diego, California area across the international border in the United States (and holds cable coverage in San Diego on Cox systems). XEWT's transmitter is located on Mount San Antonio in Tijuana, with a San Diego bureau on Third Avenue in Chula Vista.\n\nThough its callsign seems to indicate that it is a repeater of XEW-TDT in Mexico City, XEWT airs a selection of programming from all four Televisa networks. It also airs local news and programming aimed towards Hispanics on both sides of the border.\n\nXEWT was the first Spanish-language station for San Diego and Tijuana. It signed on July 18, 1960 and received its concession on August 6 of that year, with Telesistema Mexicano owning it through concessionaire Televisora de Calimex, S.A. It was Tijuana's second TV station, with English-language sister station XETV signing on in 1953. From the 1970s through the end of 1990, XEWT was originally an affiliate of the Spanish International Network (later Univision).\n\nTelevisa was approved to add FOROtv to six stations, primarily regional outlets, in northern Mexico in January 2018. Nationally, FOROtv moved to subchannels of Las Estrellas transmitters, including XHUAA-TDT, in spring 2019.\n\nXEWT discontinued its analog signal on May 28, 2013. Tijuana was the first city in Mexico where the analog-to digital conversion took place. Immediately after the closure, worries about effects on the Baja California elections prompted the restoration of analog service until July 18, when XEWT and other Tijuana TV stations discontinued their analog signals again, this time for good. At this time, the callsign changed to XEWT-TDT.\n\nXEWT operates repeaters in Tecate (which was not converted until 2015) and Col. Playas de Tijuana.\n\nAs the local Televisa station in Tijuana, XEWT produces local programs during the day and overnight. During the afternoons and evenings (from 6:30 to 10:30 p.m.), the station simulcasts Televisa's national network Las Estrellas, which is dedicated to telenovelas, game shows, comedies, and sports. Las Estrellas can also be seen on XEWT's sister station XHUAA-TDT, which is the network's repeater station in Tijuana. \n\nThere are several interesting schedule overlaps between XEWT and San Diego's Univision affiliate, KBNT-CD (channel 17). Although both are competitors in the San Diego/Tijuana market, they both carry some of the same programming. Univision carries some Televisa programming in its lineup and this is thus reflected in KBNT's lineup.\n\nXEWT established a reorganized news department called Las Noticias (formerly \"Notivisa\") on February 29, 1988. It originally established a Tijuana-centric 5 p.m. newscast and a 10:30 p.m. newscast focusing on all of Baja California. Among the personalities who have anchored and reported for \"Notivisa\" is veteran anchor Fernando del Monte, who worked for the station from 1989 to 2007 and again since 2015, running as the PRI candidate for Municipal President of Tijuana in between stints.\n\nLike its sister stations in Baja California, XEWT produces 17½ hours of locally produced newscast each week, including a weeknight regional newscast, as seen on XEWT, XHBC in Mexicali, and XHS in Ensenada, which share some of XEWT's resources and news reports. XEWT previously produced a 6pm newscast until 2016.\n\nAs of January 28, 2019, XEWT revamped its hours of local news. The station now airs a 90-minute morning newscast at 6:30 a.m. (followed by Que Buen Dia), a full-hour newscast at 2 p.m., a new 90-minute evening newscast at 5 p.m., and a late night newscast at 10:30 p.m. which focuses on all of Baja California, as well as San Diego and Imperial Valley.\n\nStarting 2019, Notivisa were changed into Las Noticias\n\n"}

Hurban radio stations target young Hispanics in the United States, primarily consisting of reggaeton, latin trap, latin rap, and latin dance. Advertisements and DJs are usually presented in a mixture of English and Spanish.\n\nThe word hurban is a portmanteau of the terms \"Hispanic\" and \"urban.\"\n\nCore artists of the Hurban format include Daddy Yankee, Don Omar, Julio Voltio and Tego Calderón.\n\nKLOL in Houston, Texas debuted as the first Hurban station in the continental US in late 2004. By 2007, Clear Channel dropped the Hurban format and picked up a Spanish Contemporary format. Most of the Original personalities have been let go since and the station is no longer bilingual. The only original on-air personality that still remains to this date is Liz Arreola, or Liz de Mega as she is known. Most of the current personalities have been ordered to cease the \"Spanglish\" act on the air and stick with Spanish.\n\nThe format has grown to many other cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Denver, Miami, and Albuquerque, NM. But more Recently, the format has been replaced in several cities. The list includes Miami, Denver, Albuquerque, Dallas (KZZA), and Las Vegas.\n\nThe new radio format dubbed Hurban may seem like it is merely another attempt to profit off of the tastes of a particular ethnic group that has a preference for a given type of music, but this is not the case. These pan-Latin radio stations are embracing reggaeton, hip hop, and dancehall music, which largely comprise and explicate Hurban thoughts and ideas through their lyrics and styles. Nevertheless, the scope of this music can be comprehended more thoroughly when we understand the movement as a grassroots attempt that will perhaps bring together the pan-Latino movement in the music industry. In relation to the Hurban music movement, there are other means by which Hispanic Urbans are being encouraged to represent their ethnic background. Clear Channel Communications, a major broadcasting company, announced in fall 2004 that it was transforming 20 to 25 of its 1,200 stations to Hispanic formats over the subsequent 18 months. Some individuals may feel disappointed when they realize that one of their favorite radio stations was changed in an effort to accommodate the needs of the Hurban audience. Tension between musical genres may also exist in subtle commercial competitions such as these with the potential to effect an individual’s prejudices that tend to develop in a multi-racial and multi-cultural America. Hurban radio stations may provide the means for the pan-Latino population to develop a sense of communication within the community that will reverberate in America and abroad.\n\n"}

On January 1, 2002, all the municipalities on the island of Montreal were merged into the city of Montreal.\n\nHowever, following a change of government in the 2003 Quebec election and a 2004 referendum, some of those municipalities became independent cities again on January 1, 2006. The recreated cities did not regain all of their previous powers, however. A new urban agglomeration of Montreal was created, which resulted in the recreated cities still sharing certain municipal services with Montreal.\n\nUntil 2001, the island of Montreal was divided into the city of Montreal proper and 27 smaller municipalities. These formed the Montreal Urban Community (MUC). On January 1, 2002, all 28 municipalities on the island were merged into the \"megacity\" of Montreal, under the slogan \"\"Une île, une ville\"\" (\"One island, one city\"). This merger was part of a larger provincial scheme launched by the Parti Québécois all across Quebec, resulting in the merging of many municipalities. It was felt that larger municipalities would be more efficient, and would be more able to withstand comparison with the other cities in Canada, which had already expanded their territory—most notably Toronto, which had merged with the other municipalities of what was then dubbed \"Metro Toronto\" in 1998-1999 (the GTA is the larger regional area including Toronto and the surrounding cities).\n\nAs happened elsewhere in Canada, the merger was opposed by many residents on the island of Montreal. The situation on the island of Montreal was further complicated by the presence of predominantly English-speaking municipalities that were due to merge with the predominantly French-speaking city of Montreal. English speakers were afraid to lose their rights, despite claims by the mayor of Montreal that their linguistic rights would remain protected in the new city of Montreal. Many street protests were organized, lawsuits were filed, and 15 municipalities appealed to the Court of Appeal of Quebec. It was all to no avail. In Canada, municipal governments are creatures of the provincial governments, and provincial governments have the power to create and dissolve municipalities by ordinary statute.\n\nAt the 2001 census, the city of Montreal (185.94 km/71.80 sq. miles) had 1,039,534 inhabitants. After the merger, the population of the new city of Montreal (500.05 km/193.10 sq. miles) was 1,812,723 (based on 2001 census figures). The post merger city was 169% larger in terms of land area, and had 74% more people. For comparisons, at the 2001 census the city of Toronto (629.91 km/243.20 sq. miles) had 2,481,494 inhabitants.\n\nThe merged city of Montreal was divided into 27 boroughs (known in French as \"arrondissements\") in charge of local administration. The city government was responsible for larger matters such as economic development or transportation issues. It is only a coincidence that there were 27 independent municipalities before 2002, and 27 arrondissements in the merged entity. In fact, in most areas the arrondissements did not correspond to the former municipalities, cutting across the territory of the former municipalities.\n\nAt the provincial elections of April 2003, the Quebec Liberal Party defeated the Parti Québécois. One central plank of the Liberal campaign was that if elected, they would allow merged municipalities to organize referendums in order to demerge if they wished to do so. As promised, on June 20, 2004, the referendums were held throughout Quebec.\n\nThe process to demerge from the forced amalgamation was complicated. (see 2004 Quebec municipal referendums and 2000–2006 municipal reorganization in Quebec) The first stage was to sign a register in order for a referendum to be held, then the population had to vote a second time. In several areas, the referendums failed because even though a majority of those voting supported demerging, it did not meet the required threshold of 35% of registered voters. This process was detailed in a documentary film called \"The Village Resists: The Forced Municipal Mergers of Quebec\" by Ryan Young that followed the municipality of Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue as it fought successfully to demerge.\n\nOn the island of Montreal, referendums were held in 22 of the 27 previously independent municipalities. Following the referendum results, 15 of the previously independent municipalities have regained most of their independence. These are predominantly English-speaking municipalities, with also some French-speaking municipalities. Oddly, one of the 15 municipalities recreated, L'Île-Dorval, had no permanent inhabitants at the 2001 census, being a cottaging island.\n\nThe demerger took place on January 1, 2006. After this date, there were 16 municipalities on the island of Montreal—the city of Montreal proper plus 15 independent municipalities. The current city of Montreal comprises the pre-2002 city of Montreal plus 12 of the previously independent municipalities, and is divided into 19 arrondisements. The post-demerger city of Montreal has a territory of 366.02 km (141.3 sq. miles) and a population of 1,583,590 inhabitants (based on 2001 census figures). Compared with the pre-merger city of Montreal, this is a net increase of 96.8% in land area, and 52.3% in population. Compared with the post-merger city of Montreal, however, this is a net decrease of 26.8% in land area, and 12.64% in population.\n\nCorporate lobbies close to the Liberal Party of Quebec stress the fact that after the demerger, the city of Montreal still has almost as many (approx. 88%) inhabitants as the \"megacity\" of Montreal (the suburban municipalities to be recreated are less densely populated than the core city), and that the overwhelming majority of industrial sites will still be located on the territory of the post-demerger city of Montreal. The post-demerger city of Montreal will be slightly greater than half the size of the post-1998 merger city of Toronto, with roughly two thirds its size in terms of population reflecting higher population density in Montreal even including those 'suburban' municipalities which opted not to demerge.\nHowever, both the Liberal government of Quebec and the municipality of Montreal made it clear that the 15 reconstituted municipalities would not have as many powers as before the 2002 merger, even though Charest had promised complete de-amalgamation during the 2003 campaign. As with the other de-merged municipalities across Quebec, the recreated municipalities remained tied to Montreal via the newly created urban agglomeration of Montreal. While the recreated municipalities regained most of their former powers, major expenses such as police, fire and maintenance of main streets remained with the Montreal Agglomeration Council, a joint board covering the entire island of Montreal. The city of Montreal controls a supermajority of votes on the board.\n\nDespite the demerger referendums held in 2004, the controversy is still raging in Quebec. It is now focusing on the cost of demerging. Several studies show that the recreated municipalities will incur substantial financial costs, thus forcing them to increase taxes, though proponents of the demerger contest these studies.\n\nThe island of Montreal is only one component of the Montreal Metropolitan Community (MMC) (\"Communauté Métropolitaine de Montréal\" (CMM) ), in charge of planning, coordinating, and financing economic development, public transportation, garbage collection, etc., across the metropolitan area of Montreal. The Metropolitan Community of Montreal covers 3,839 km (1,482 sq. miles), with 3,431,551 inhabitants living inside its borders in 2002; it is thus larger in area and population than the city of Toronto (even after its 1998 merger). However, the city of Toronto is larger than the city of Montreal proper, and Toronto's metro area (not a legal entity) is larger than the Montreal Metropolitan Community, with and 5.8 million people. The president of the Montreal Metropolitan Community is the mayor of Montreal.\n\n"}

Sporting matching ring attire and carrying sledgehammers to the ring, they were known as \"The Destruction Crew\". They feuded with The Olympians, Ken Patera and Brad Rheingans, and challenged them to a “car lifting” contest. During the challenge, The Crew attacked The Olympians and, in storyline, injured them. The Olympians' injuries forced them to vacate their AWA Tag Team Championship which were then placed in a tournament. The Crew went on to defeat Greg Gagne and Paul Diamond to win the title tournament on October 1, 1989.

Although neither Enos nor Bloom were technically \"rookies,\" fans voted The Destruction Crew the 1989 Rookie of the Year in \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\", making them the only tag team to win this award.\n\nBy the end of 1990, the AWA was effectively on hiatus and would eventually shut down entirely by May 1991. The Destruction Crew's entrance theme in the AWA was the highly popular Queen song \"We Will Rock You\", a theme of defeating your opponents in sports and leaving them in humiliation. This was most fitting considering by the time the AWA went under, they were viewed upon as a tag team with one of the best win/loss records in the history of the company.\n\nWhile still AWA World Tag Team Champions, the Destruction Crew joined World Championship Wrestling during the spring of 1990. In WCW they wrestled under masks as the \"Minnesota Wrecking Crew II\" and were managed by Ole Anderson who was part of the original Minnesota Wrecking Crew. They attempted without success to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship from The Steiner Brothers during a brief feud.\n\nAfter the AWA closed, the Destruction Crew went to Japan and compete in a series of matches in the New Japan Pro Wrestling including an unsuccessful title match against then IWGP Tag Team Champions Keiji Mutoh and Masahiro Chono on August 19, 1990.\n\nOn April 16, 1991 Enos & Bloom received a tryout match for the World Wrestling Federation at a \"Wrestling Challenge\" taping in Cedar Rapids, IA. In May 1991, the team were transformed into Beau (Bloom) and Blake (Enos), \"The Beverly Brothers\". Now wearing flamboyant purple tights and capes to the ring, their gimmick was that of two spoiled rich brats. They were originally managed by Coach (John Tolos), then by The Genius. They made their televised debut on the June 22 episode of \"Superstars\" by defeating enhancement talents Rob Jones and Tom Zeller. After making their WWF pay-per-view debut on a winning team at Survivor Series '91, they were launched into feuds with the Legion of Doom, The Bushwhackers (who they defeated at the 1992 Royal Rumble) and The Natural Disasters (who they unsuccessfully challenged for the WWF World Tag Team Championship at SummerSlam '92). By the later part of 1992, however, they would be used primarily to put over other tag teams; they were on the losing end of an eight-man elimination tag team match at Survivor Series '92 and were defeated by their old rivals The Steiner Brothers at the 1993 Royal Rumble. Throughout late 1992 and early 1993, they also found themselves in comedic mixed tag team matches, paired with Little Louie against The Bushwhackers and Tiger Jackson. \n\nBloom left the WWF in April 1993 and semi-retired from professional wrestling while Enos, still under the Blake Beverly moniker, remained in the company for a few months, mainly as enhancement talent on their weekly syndicated shows.\n\nThey would reunite in Minnesota as the Destruction Crew from their AWA days. During this time they wrestled in the independent circuit. On November 20, they defeated Tekno Team 2000 in at an AWA event in Red wing, Minnesota. In 1995 they once again went their separate ways.\n\nEnos appeared as \"The Mauler\" during the match on \"WCW Monday Nitro\" in 1996 where Scott Hall made his debut. The two had a brief reunion in World Championship Wrestling from 1997 to 1998 for a few matches. They remained low-card performers, and after a few matches together, the team finally disbanded.\n\n"}

The film also features Robert Benchley, Susan Hayward and Cecil Kellaway. The screenplay by Robert Pirosh and Marc Connelly and uncredited other writers, including Dalton Trumbo, is based on the novel \"The Passionate Witch\" by Thorne Smith, who died before he could finish it; it was completed by Norman H. Matson and published in 1941.\n\nTwo witches in colonial Salem, Jennifer and her father Daniel, are burned at the stake after being denounced by Puritan Jonathan Wooley. Their ashes were buried beneath a tree to imprison their evil spirits. In revenge, Jennifer curses Wooley and all his male descendants, dooming them always to marry the wrong woman.\n\nCenturies pass. Generation after generation, Wooley men marry cruel, shrewish women. Finally, in 1942, lightning splits the tree, freeing the spirits of Jennifer and Daniel. They discover Wallace Wooley, living nearby and running for governor, on the eve of marrying the ambitious and spoiled Estelle Masterson, whose father J.B. just happens to be Wooley's chief political backer.\n\nInitially, Jennifer and Daniel manifest themselves as white vertical smoky 'trails', occasionally hiding in empty, or sometimes not-so-empty, bottles of alcohol. Jennifer persuades Daniel to create a human body for her so she can torment Wallace. Daniel needs a fire to perform the spell, so he burns down a building, appropriately enough, the Pilgrim Hotel. This serves dual purposes, as Jennifer uses it to get the passing Wallace to rescue her from the flames.\n\nJennifer tries hard to seduce Wallace without magic. Even though he is strongly attracted to her, he refuses to put off his marriage. She concocts a love potion, but her scheme goes awry when a painting falls on her. Wallace revives her by giving her the drink she had intended for him.\n\nDaniel conjures himself a body. Then he and Jennifer crash the wedding, though they are at cross purposes. Daniel hates all Wooleys and tries to prevent his daughter from helping one of them. His attempts at interference land him in jail, too drunk to remember the spell to turn Wallace into a frog. Meanwhile, Estelle finds the couple embracing and the wedding is called off. Outraged, J.B. promises to denounce the candidate in all his newspapers. Wallace finally admits that he loves Jennifer, and they elope.\n\nJennifer then works overtime with her witchcraft to rescue Wallace's political career. She conjures up little clouds of brainwashing white smoke that \"convince\" every voter to support Wallace, and he is elected in a landslide, where even his opponent doesn't vote for himself. The unanimous vote for him convinces Wallace that she is a witch. In disgust, Daniel strips his daughter of her magical powers, and vows to return her to the tree that imprisoned them.\n\nIn a panic, Jennifer interrupts Wallace's victory speech, imploring him to help her escape. Unfortunately, the taxi they get into to get away is driven by Daniel, who takes them in an airborne ride back to the tree. At the stroke of midnight, Wallace is left with Jennifer's lifeless body, while two plumes of smoke watch. Before they return to the tree, Jennifer asks to watch Wallace's torment. While Daniel gloats, Jennifer reclaims her body, explaining to Wallace, \"Love is stronger than witchcraft.\" She quickly puts the top back on the bottle of liquor her father is hiding in, keeping him drunk and powerless. Years later, Wallace and Jennifer have children, and the housekeeper enters to complain about their youngest daughter, who enters riding a broom.\n\n\nCast notes:\n\nThe novel upon which the film is based was mainly written by Thorne Smith, who died in 1934. His papers included an unfinished novel entitled \"The Passionate Witch\". Then three-quarters complete, its resolution was written by his friend Norman Matson and was published in July 1941. The book became a best seller.\n\n\"I Married a Witch\" was produced by Paramount Pictures, and had the working title of \"He Married a Witch\". Director René Clair was looking for a new project after his first American film, \"The Flame of New Orleans\" (1941). His agent sent him a copy of \"The Passionate Witch\". Clair took it to Preston Sturges, then in favor at Paramount, who convinced Clair and the studio that it would be a good vehicle for Veronica Lake, with Sturges as producer. Paramount bought the film rights in October 1941. Dalton Trumbo was signed to write the script.\n\nRobert Pirosh was called in to work on the script with Trumbo. Trumbo left the project after clashing with Sturges. Sturges himself left the film before it was completed due to artistic differences with director René Clair, and did not want to receive a screen credit. Clair, who also contributed to the dialogue, apparently worked closely with writer Robert Pirosh.\nJoel McCrea was originally announced to play the male lead in December 1941. However, by February in 1942, he withdrew from the project; he later said this was because he did not want to work with Veronica Lake again, after not getting along with her on \"Sullivan's Travels\". McCrea's refusal to make the film caused production to be postponed. This enabled Lake to appear in \"The Glass Key\" (1942).\n\nMarch and Lake also had problems, beginning with March's pre-production comment that Lake was \"a brainless little blonde sexpot, void of any acting ability\", to which Lake retaliated by calling March a \"pompous poseur\". Things did not get much better during filming, as Lake was prone to playing practical jokes on March, like hiding a 40-pound weight under her dress for a scene in which March had to carry her, or pushing her foot repeatedly into his groin during the filming of a from-the-waist-up shot. Patricia Morison was considered for the role of Estelle, and Walter Abel for Dudley. Margaret Hayes was considered for the film as well, and was screentested.\n\nThe film was one of a number of films sold by Paramount to United Artists in September, when UA did not have enough films to meet its commitments and Paramount had a surplus. It was released by UA on October 30 that year.\n\n\"Diabolique\" said \" this is wickedly funny, an absolute delight – due greatly to Lake who was never more alluring, strutting around in men’s pajamas, casting spells, chasing after March and causing devilry. This was her only fantasy movie and it beggars belief that Paramount never tried her again in that genre – she had a vaguely “otherworld” appearance (that hair, that voice) perfect for it.\"\n\nThe movie was released on VHS by Warner Home Video in the U.S. on July 18, 1990. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by The Criterion Collection in the U.S. on October 8, 2013.\n\n\"I Married a Witch\" was nominated for a 1943 Academy Award for \"Best Music (Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture)\" for composer Roy Webb.\n\n"}

However, two parties objected to the concession award, which was announced in the summer of 1969: Tijuana FM, S.A., headed by Clemente Serna Alvear, and Mario Enrique Mayans Concha, founder of Cadena Baja California (now Grupo Cadena). In June 1971, the case was heard by the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation, and in January 1988, the SCT finally selected one of the objecting parties to become the concessionaire: Mayans Concha.\n\nThe concession was awarded on November 30, 1988, and Mayans set out to build Tijuana's third TV station and second UHF, after XHAS came to air in 1981. Transmitter tests began in the summer of 1989 and the station was on air by 1990, with a schedule of music videos and some local programs including, in 1991, 25 San Diego Padres road games in Spanish and adding Spanish play-by-play to ESPN and TNT telecasts of NFL preseason contests. The music video programming, an outgrowth of sister XHMORE-FM 98.9, came to dominate the station's output, and channel 45 was known as \"MORE TV\" during the 1990s.\n\nChannel 45 began also adding blocks of programming to Galavisión, eventually becoming a Televisa local partner that exclusively rebroadcast network programming. From 2006 to early 2012, it carried the Canal 5 network, but in early 2012, Galavisión programming returned to XHBJ-TV, with Canal 5 moving to XETV, where it was broadcast on analog channel 6 and digital channel 6.2.\n\nXHBJ lost Nu9ve—the renamed Galavisión—on November 1, 2019, to a subchannel of XETV. The station then rebranded as \"45 TV Tijuana\" and began airing mostly programming from Multimedios Televisión, along with the local morning and late evening newscasts of Canal 66 of Mexicali.\n\nXHBJ carries one subchannel:\nDue to the Mexican analog to digital conversion mandate, XHBJ-TV discontinued its analog signal on May 28, 2013. Tijuana was the first city where the analog to digital conversion begins in Mexico. However, due to penetration problems and impending local elections the other television stations restored their analog signals again two days after (to turn them off again in August), with the exception of XHBJ. Because of the presence of KCAL-TV in the nearby Los Angeles market on channel 9, XHBJ-TDT was unable to take the channel 9 virtual channel assignment Nu9ve holds throughout the rest of Mexico and the station continued to use its pre-digital virtual channel of 45.\n\nXHBJ added a digital signal in the late 2000s on channel 44, where it remained after Tijuana's first-in-Mexico digital conversion in 2013. In March 2018, in order to facilitate the repacking of TV services out of the 600 MHz band (channels 38-51), XHBJ was assigned channel 27 for continued digital operations.\n\n"}

In 1931 he began working at the Pulkovo Observatory, located to the south of Leningrad. He was considered to be one of the most promising astrophysicists in Russia. Kozyrev was a victim of the Stalinist purges of the Pulkovo Observatory. Started by the accusations of a disgruntled graduate student, most of the observatory staff died as a result. Kozyrev was arrested in November 1936 and sentenced to 10 years for counterrevolutionary activity. In January 1941, he was given another 10-year sentence for \"hostile propaganda\". While incarcerated, he was allowed to work in engineering-type jobs. Due to the lobbying by his colleagues, he won an early release from detention in December 1946. As a result of his imprisonment he was mentioned in \"The Gulag Archipelago\" by Alexandr Solzhenitsyn.\n\nDuring his imprisonment, Kozyrev attempted to continue working on purely theoretical physics. He considered the problem of the energy source of stars and formulated a theory. But in his isolation, he was unaware of the discovery of atomic energy. After his release, Kozyrev refused to believe the theory that stars are powered by atomic fusion.\n\nKozyrev was a bold thinker and was respected by prominent scientists of his time (Arkady Kuzmin, Vasily Moroz, and Iosef Shklovsky all speak highly of him), even though his work was often of a very doubtful nature. Among these theories was the claim that the polar caps of Mars were purely atmospheric cloud formations, rather than ice-covered ground.\n\nHe is most noted for his observation of the transient lunar phenomenon in the crater Alphonsus on the Moon. In 1958 he observed a patch of white within the crater, and a spectrum of the area appeared to reveal an emission cloud of carbon particles. Transient lunar phenomenon had long recorded what appeared to be temporary emissions on the lunar surface, and Kozyrev's observation was the first observation of the kind, and appeared to provide confirmation that the Moon was volcanically active.\n\nIn 1953, Kozyrev attempted to analyze the phenomenon of ashen light, a nocturnal air glow on Venus whose existence remains controversial to this day. He also made the earliest photometric measurements of the visible and ultraviolet spectrum of Venus. His calculation of the thermal balance of Venus disputed the popular theory that the clouds of Venus consisted of dust. Kozyrev argued that energy absorbed in the upper atmosphere created high altitude storms, but the surface of Venus would be still and dimly lit. This work influenced the theory of Venus and Nobel Laureate Harold Urey devoted a paper to the analysis and implications of it.\n\nKozyrev wrongly believed that the white poles of Mars were caused by cloud formations in the atmosphere, not ice on the surface.\n\nDue to his experiments and publications (Causal Mechanics/Theory of Time) he became a controversial figure in Russian scientific community. In the 1930s, Kozyrev was considered the most promising new astrophysicist in Russia, but his arrest and long imprisonment destroyed his career during what is usually the most creative period of a scientist's life. Isolated from all news and publications, he pondered the source of internal heat in stars and planets, but was unaware of the discoveries being made in quantum mechanics and atomic energy. After his release, he struggled to recover his place in science, but his own theories were out of step with the current physics by that time.\n\nThe dispute over Kozyrev's causal-mechanics theory spilled into \"Pravda\" in 1959, with criticism by some of the Soviet Union's leading physicists, including Igor Tamm. In January 1960, the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Bureau of Physico-Mathematical Sciences appointed a commission to resolve the dispute. The nine men were assigned to investigate the theory, experimental evidence, and the special issue of planetary asymmetry which Kozyrev claimed was evidence of a gyro-gravitational \"latitude effect\". Their findings were:\n\n\nIn September 1969, the International Academy of Astronautics (IAA, Paris, France) awarded N. Kozyrev a nominal gold medal \"For remarkable telescopic and spectral observations of luminescent phenomena on the Moon, showing that the Moon remains a still active body, and stimulating development of the methods of luminescent researches world wide.\"\n\nIn December 1969, the State Committee for Affairs of Discovery and Inventions at the Ministerial Council of the\nUSSR, awarded N. Kozyrev a diploma \"For the discovery of tectonic activity of the Moon.\"\n\n\"The following astronomical features are named for him:\"\n\n\nA Kozyrev mirror is a device made from aluminum (sometimes from glass, or reflecting mirror-like material) spiral shape surfaces, which, introduced by allegedly based on Kozyrev's theories, are able to focus different types of radiation alike to magnifying glasses, including the types of radiation coming from biological objects. Kozyrev mirrors were used in experiments related to extrasensory perception (ESP), conducted in the Institute of Experimental Medicine of Siberia, division of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Humans, allocated into the cylindric spirals (usually 1.5 rotations clockwise, made of polished aluminum) allegedly experienced anomalous psycho-physical sensations, which had been recorded in the minutes of the research experiments.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2100390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100390", "title": "Supercritical airfoil", "text": "Supercritical airfoil\n\nA supercritical airfoil is an airfoil designed primarily to delay the onset of wave drag in the transonic speed range. Supercritical airfoils are characterized by their flattened upper surface, highly cambered (\"downward-curved\") aft section, and larger leading-edge radius compared with NACA 6-series laminar airfoil shapes. Standard wing shapes are designed to create lower pressure over the top of the wing. Both the thickness distribution and the camber of the wing determine how much the air accelerates around the wing. As the speed of the aircraft approaches the speed of sound, the air accelerating around the wing reaches Mach 1 and shockwaves begin to form. The formation of these shockwaves causes wave drag. Supercritical airfoils are designed to minimize this effect by flattening the upper surface of the wing.\n\nThe supercritical airfoils were suggested first in Germany in 1940, when K. A. Kawalki at Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt Berlin-Adlershof designed airfoils characterised by elliptical leading edges, maximal thickness located downstream up to 50% chord and a flat upper surface. Testing of these airfoils was reported by B. Göthert and K. A. Kawalki in 1944. Kawalki's airfoil shapes were identical to Richard Whitcomb's. Hawker-Siddeley in Hatfield, England, designed in 1959–1965 improved airfoil profiles known as rooftop rear-loaded airfoils, which were the basis of the Airbus A300 supercritical wing, which first flew in 1972.\n\nIn the U.S., supercritical airfoils were studied in the 1960s, by then NASA engineer Richard Whitcomb, and were first tested on a modified North American T-2C Buckeye. After this first test, the airfoils were tested at higher speeds on the TF-8A Crusader. While the design was initially developed as part of the supersonic transport (SST) project at NASA, it has since been mainly applied to increase the fuel efficiency of many high-subsonic aircraft. The supercritical airfoil shape is incorporated into the design of a supercritical wing.\n\nKawalki's research was the basis for the objection in 1984 against the US-patent specification for the supercritical airfoil.\n\nResearch aircraft of the 1950s and 1960s found it difficult to break the sound barrier, or even reach Mach 0.9, with conventional airfoils. Supersonic airflow over the upper surface of the traditional airfoil induced excessive wave drag and a form of stability loss called Mach tuck. Due to the airfoil shape used, supercritical wings experience these problems less severely and at much higher speeds, thus allowing the wing to maintain high performance at speeds closer to Mach 1. Techniques learned from studies of the original supercritical airfoil sections are used in designing airfoils for high-speed subsonic and transonic aircraft from the Airbus A300 and Boeing 777 to the McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II.\nSupercritical airfoils feature four main benefits: they have a higher drag-divergence Mach number, they develop shock waves further aft than traditional airfoils, they greatly reduce shock-induced boundary layer separation, and their geometry allows more efficient wing design (e.g., a thicker wing and/or reduced wing sweep, each of which may allow a lighter wing). At a particular speed for a given airfoil section, the critical Mach number, flow over the upper surface of an airfoil can become locally supersonic, but slows down to match the pressure at the trailing edge of the lower surface without a shock. However, at a certain higher speed, the drag-divergence Mach number, a shock is required to recover enough pressure to match the pressures at the trailing edge. This shock causes transonic wave drag and can induce flow separation behind it; both have negative effects on the airfoil's performance. \nAt a certain point along the airfoil, a shock is generated, which increases the pressure coefficient to the critical value \"C\", where the local flow velocity will be Mach 1. The position of this shockwave is determined by the geometry of the airfoil; a supercritical foil is more efficient because the shockwave is minimized and is created as far aft as possible, thus reducing drag. Compared to a typical airfoil section, the supercritical airfoil creates more of its lift at the aft end, due to its more even pressure distribution over the upper surface.\n\nIn addition to improved transonic performance, a supercritical wing's enlarged leading edge gives it excellent high-lift characteristics. Consequently, aircraft utilizing a supercritical wing have superior takeoff and landing performance. This makes the supercritical wing a favorite for designers of cargo transport aircraft. A notable example of one such heavy-lift aircraft that uses a supercritical wing is the C-17 Globemaster III.\n\nThe stall behavior of supercritical profile is unlike that of low-speed airfoils. The boundary layer along the leading edge of a supercritical wing begins thin and laminar at cruise angles. As angle of attack (AOA) increases, this laminar layer detaches in a narrow region and forms a short bubble. The airflow, now turbulent, reattaches to the surface aft of the bubble; the increase in drag is not extreme in this condition. However, if AOA is increased to the stalling point, an adverse pressure gradient builds, and a shockwave can form within the thin boundary layer ahead of the bubble, even at relatively low speed. At the critical angle, the bubble rapidly expands (\"bursts\"), causing airflow to suddenly detach from the entire surface (from leading to trailing edge). The abrupt loss of lift is exacerbated by the lack of traditional stall \"warning\" or buffet as a low-speed contour would provide. Due to this lack of buffet warning, aircraft using supercritical wings are routinely equipped with stick-shaker alert and stick-pusher recovery systems, to meet certification requirements. Since wing fences \"prevent the entire wing from stalling at once\", they may form an alternative recovery-system in this regard.\n\n\n"}

Selys Longchamps has been regarded as the founding figure of odonatology, the study of the dragonflies and damselflies. His wealth and influence enabled him to amass one of the finest collections of neuropteroid insects and to describe many species from around the world. His collection is housed in the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences.\n\nSelys was a wealthy aristocrat born in Paris to Michel Laurent de Selys Longchamps and Marie-Denise Gandolphe. He was educated at home by private tutors and never attended school or university. Nevertheless, he became known as the world's leading authority on Odonata as well as an expert on Neuroptera and European Orthoptera. He was also a leading ornithologist. A Liberal Party representative in the Belgian Parliament, he became Councillor for Waremme in 1846, entered the Belgian Senate in 1855, and was finally elected President of the Belgian Senate from 1880 to 1884.\n\nHis early interest in birds is shown by a book of coloured figures of Belgian species painted when he was 16. Ornithology remained a lifelong interest and he assembled an ornithological museum at Waremme, maintaining very large collections of birds, both European and exotic, including a great auk and an egg. He was also interested in small mammals. At 18 (1831) he published his first scientific paper, a list of the insects of Liège and in 1837 a list of the dragonflies or Odonata and butterflies and moths or Lepidoptera of Belgium. From that date on, a continuous flow of papers on the Odonata appeared. The works were often monographic, examples being, 1840 \"Monographie des Libellulides d'Europe\"and 1850 \"Revue des Odonates d'Europe\", two large works on \"Gomphines\" and \"Calopterygines\". There were also systematic works containing phylogenetic analyses, tables and keys) of the \"Gomphines\", Calopterygines\", Agrionines\", \"Cordulines\" and ( generic only) \"Aeschnines\", the only family not so treated being the difficult \"Libellulines\". There were (very numerous) local faunas for dragonflies (synopses), appendices to travel works, phylogenetic and morphological notes.\n\nSelys met and began a collaboration with Hermann August Hagen in 1845; They jointly produced the Revue and two monographs. Hagen also aided work on the Synopses and sometimes Selys is given as the author in Kirby's catalogue when Hagen is (in many such instances it is clearly stated by Selys that he had never seen the insects and that Hagen was the author). Selys is the properly attributed author of well over 1,000 species, an enormous number compared to Hagen and more than half of known species. Aware of being an \"homme distrait\" (distracted man), Selys often affixed names to undescribed species in his collection (nomina nuda). This led to much later nomenclatural confusion. Selys was an inveterate traveller, spending long periods in most European countries and being an honorary member of almost all European entomological societies including the Royal Entomological Society which so honoured him in 1871. He helped to found the Société Entomologique de Belgique in 1856.\n\nHe amassed the greatest collection of Neuroptera and Orthoptera in the world, incorporating the collections of Pierre André Latreille, Jules Pièrre Rambur, Jean Guillaume Audinet-Serville, and Félix Édouard Guérin-Méneville, and wrote over 250 papers some of which are masterworks. His collection is in the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, although there are de Selys types in many other museums, including the Hope Department of Entomology, University of Oxford. He died at Liège.\n\n\nSelys published over 250 works on entomology, ornithology and other topics in natural history:\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish\n\nFrench\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2100395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100395", "title": "The Mischief Makers", "text": "The Mischief Makers\n\nThe Mischief Makers are a group of activists and artists based in Nottingham, UK, who formed early 2005 as a creative response to the G8 Summit, held at Gleneagles Hotel, Scotland, in July that year. The collective uses creativity to support community, environmental and social justice campaigns, and activist groups. The group's aim is \"to inspire people and empower them to identify challenges and take action in their local environment\".\n\nEarly 2005, a benefit event in aid of the tsunami disaster was organised in various venues around Nottingham. Two local artists made Geisha-like costumes and performed an interactive theatre piece on the streets, trying to get the public to interact with the costumes and the \"wish fishes\" to engage with the issues related to the disaster. Afterwards, the costumes were altered and used as an interactive way of engaging with people on the issues of debt, poverty and climate change as the Summit of the G8 was approaching.\n\nDuring the spring of 2005, various kimono-making workshops asked people to \"join the geisha of gaiety on a passionate mission of peace and progression, when 8 men think to meet undisturbed, unruffled and untroubled to decide upon the worlds future\". A \"Geisha Bloc\" took part in the Make Poverty History march in Edinburgh on 2 July, and others took their costumes to the camp in Stirling for direct action planned to disturb the summit.\n\nList of earlier actions\n\nNottingham Against Incineration and Landfill stepped up its campaign mid-2005 after the proposed expansion of Eastcroft Incinerator was announced. The expansion has been controversial as Sneinton, the most affected area, has been dealing with various health problems as a consequence of the nearby incinerator. The Mischief Makers have supported the NAIL Campaign on numerous occasions with bannerdrops, awareness raising, fundraising and during demonstrations and protests with costumes, puppets and performance.\n\nAbout the campaign: \"NAIL (Nottingham Against Incineration and Landfill) was originally set up in 2002 by a group of local environmental campaigners. We decided to form a pressure group, when a woman who developed breast cancer approached members of Nottingham Greenpeace. She claimed that there was two other ladies, who shared her office for many years overlooking the incinerator plant, had also developed cancer, one of whom had died. They were believed that their condition was caused by their prolonged exposure to pollution from Eastcroft incinerator. The group developed and was joined by local residents of the Eastcroft Incinerator. We have since gained growing support, since the expansion announcement.\"\n\nList of actions\n\nIn October 2005, a new piece called 'The Solidarity Sisters' was developed to support the work of the No Borders Network, whose aim is to spread the message of solidarity with refugees and those seeking asylum in the UK.\n\nOne Solidarity Sister explains: \"We have appeared in these costumes a couple of times in Nottingham and in Sheffield. We dress in little white dresses, with one of us in lederhosen and hats and bags. It's about showing solidarity. It's more a sort of universal image. On the bands and the skirts there's lots of images of people holding hands. It's about spreading equality, friendship and acceptance. We look a little bit like aid nurses. Like it's about having a helping hand. Being there to support people. The dresses were made from reclaimed fabrics. They were used for car seat padding. It's good to be reusing stuff.\"\n\nAbout the No Border Network: \"The no border network is a tool for all groups and grass root organizations who work on the questions of migrants and asylum seekers in order to struggle alongside with them for freedom of movement, for the freedom for all to stay in the place which they have chosen, against repression and the many controls which multiply the borders everywhere in all countries\".\n\nList of actions\n\nThe Art and Activism Caravan was a project initiated by the Amsterdam-based youth organisation European Youth For Action in which The Mischief Makers took part. Its idea was to \"support and connect youth, campaign, community and activist groups, their actions and campaigns with creative forms of activism.\". Also known as the 'AA Caravan' a group of around 10 people traveled from Greece via Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro, Serbia and Hungary to the environmental youth Ecotopia gathering in Slovakia. The Caravan worked intensively with numerous groups over a 3-month period.\n\nList of groups involved\n\n\nList of actions\n\n\nThe Camp for Climate Action, also known as the 'Climate Camp' was held in Barlow, Selby, North West Yorkshire, to push for action on the issue of climate change. Over 600 people came together for 10 days to follow workshops, share skills and take action. The camp was set up near Drax power station, the largest coal fired power station in Europe and the biggest single contributor to CO2 emissions in the UK. The Mischief Makers made a giant ostrich puppet which was taken on the 'kids march' to Drax Power Station on Thursday, 31 August 2006, and seized by the police. Chief Inspector Barry Smith told the BBC \"a giant home-made ostrich had been seized by police, and found to be containing tools which could have been used by demonstrators to chain themselves to fences\". More coverage from the Climate Camp can be found on UK Indymedia. \n\nIn September 2006, the Mischief Makers started to support the work of unions and other group opposing the cuts and privatisation of the UK's National Health Service (NHS). To add a creative element to the trade unions' work, a giant syringe was built and included in a \"2000 people strong demonstration\" through the City of Nottingham on 23 September.\n\n"}
{"id": "2100398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100398", "title": "Alemdar Mustafa Pasha", "text": "Alemdar Mustafa Pasha\n\nAlemdar Mustafa Pasha (also called Bayraktar Mustafa Pasha; died 15 November 1808) was an Ottoman military commander and a Grand Vizier born in Khotyn in then Ottoman territory Ukraine in 1765. He was of Albanian origin, from the village of Goskovë near Korçë. Both \"alemdar\" and \"bayraktar\" mean \"the standard bearer\" and were the names given to the same rank in the Janissary corps. Alemdar Mustafa Pasha is often regarded as one of the pioneering public figures, who recognized the need of a modern army, as he was instrumental in setting up the French military mission in 1796.\n\nHe was originally the \"ayan\" (provincial notable) of Rusçuk, and one of the strongest ayans of his time. The deposition of the reformer Sultan Selim III in 1807, and his replacement with the reactionary Mustafa IV by the Janissaries and other opponents of reform, provoked Alemdar Mustafa Pasha to lead his army of Albanians and Bosnians to Constantinople in an attempt to reinstate Selim III and restore his reforms. After he arrived, Mustafa IV ordered Selim III and Mahmud II killed, succeeding in the former case. Alemdar Mustafa Pasha, seeing Selim III dead, gave fealty to Mahmud II (Selim's cousin), and he was instated the sultan, with Alemdar as his Grand Vizier. \n\nAs vizier, Bayraktar purged the soldiers who had rebelled against Selim, removed conservatives from government positions and replaced them with men sympathetic to reform. Bayraktar modernized the army and navy and attempted to reform the Janissaries, but Mahmud, fearing a political backlash of the elite corps, halted such change. Bayraktar's power and influence and his arrogance wielding it caused a rebellion against his position. In November 1808, the Janissaries attacked the Porte and laid siege to the stone powder magazine where he and his personal guard had taken refuge. As the Janissaries were about to break in the powder barrels exploded, killing Bayraktar, his guard, and several hundred Janissaries.\n\nHe rose through the Janissary corps. After having been promoted to commandership, he took part in the wars against Austria and Russian Empire.\nIn 1808, when the Sultan Mustafa IV ascended the throne with the help of the reactionaries who opposed the reform efforts undertook by Selim III, and the deposed Selim III was imprisoned, Alemdar Mustafa Pasha was the governor of the city of Rusçuk (today \"Rousse\") in Bulgaria.\n\nAlemdar Mustafa Pasha had always been a keen supporter of Sultan Selim III. With Mustafa IV on the throne rule and the reactionary rebels commanded by Kabakçı Mustafa in command of the Ottoman capital, Mustafa Pasha gathered a council in Rusçuk and the council decided to take action.\nOn 21 June 1808, Alemdar Mustafa Pasha and his army of about 15,000 men arrived in Constantinople. They easily took control, and Alemdar Mustafa Pasha ordered the rebels killed or exiled.\nWhen Mustafa IV learned of these events, he decided to have his uncle, Selim III, and his younger brother, Prince Mahmut, killed in order to remain the only member of the imperial family. The executioners arrived first in the room of Selim III in the palace. Selim III, who was playing reed flute and had no weapons, resisted with his flute, but his efforts proved futile and he was strangled. His dead body was brought in front of Alemdar Mustafa Pasha, who began weeping, thinking he had failed in all his objectives.\nHis men warned him that Mustafa IV's men planned to kill Prince Mahmud as well. The executioners had raided the prince's room, but the servants hid the prince on the roof. Alemdar Mustafa and his men arrived and broke down the palace doors. They killed the rebels and eventually saved the prince.\nAlemdar Mustafa Pasha declared prince Mahmud the new sultan with the name Mahmud II, and became his grand vizier.\n\nBut differences of opinion soon emerged between the two. First of all, he made an agreement with the rebel representative from Anatolian lands, which was named \"Charter of Alliance\" (\"Sened-i Ittifak\"). Sultan Mahmud thought that his authority was limited by that agreement, and he withdrew his support for the Pasha.\nSecondly, he re-established the army of Nizam-ı Cedid under a different name: Sekban-I Cedid Army. the Nizam-ı Cedid Army was a rival of the corps of Janissaries; therefore the Janissaries hated this army. The new name can be explained as an effort not to anger Janissaries. Furthermore, Pasha conducted an investigation among the Janissary corps and he fired the men who were not in fact Janissaries but receiving Janissary salaries all the same.\n\nHis measures would eventually lay the ground for further reforms in the Ottoman Empire. But meanwhile, the ruling elites were resentful of him. On 15 November 1808, about a thousand Janissaries raided Alemdar Mustafa Pasha's house. Realizing he could not survive the assault, he ignited the gunpowder reserves in the cellar of his house, killing himself and approximately 400 Janissaries in the ensuing explosion. Alemdar Mustafa Pasha was buried in the courtyard of the Zeynep Sultan Mosque in Istanbul.\n\nA street in Istanbul near the Sublime Porte is named after Alemdar Mustafa Pasha. A plaque there states that his father was a Janissary from Ruscuk.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2100405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100405", "title": "Philip J. Klass", "text": "Philip J. Klass\n\nPhilip Julian Klass (November 8, 1919 – August 9, 2005) was an American journalist, and UFO researcher, known for his skepticism regarding UFOs. In the ufological and skeptical communities, Klass inspires polarized appraisals. He has been called the \"Sherlock Holmes of UFOlogy\". Klass demonstrated \"the crusader's zeal for what seems 'right,' regardless of whether it brings popular acclaim,\" a trait he claimed his father instilled in him. \"I've found,\" said Klass, \"that roughly 97, 98 percent of the people who report seeing UFOs are fundamentally intelligent, honest people who have seen something — usually at night, in darkness — that is unfamiliar, that they cannot explain.\" The rest, he said, were frauds.\n\nLongtime ufologist James W. Moseley illustrated the ambivalence many UFO researchers feel about Klass. On the one hand, Moseley argued that Klass was sincere in his motives and that his work ultimately benefited the field of Ufology. In his memoirs, Moseley contended that, when pressed, most leading ufologists would admit that Klass knew the subject and the people involved and was welcomed, or at least pleasantly tolerated, at UFO meetings. However, Moseley also wrote that he and Klass \"have had and continue to have intense doctrinal and factual disagreements, and there are things about Phil's 'style', like his attack on James E. McDonald, that I do not admire or agree with.\" In a 1999 interview, fellow debunker Gary Posner wrote that despite some recent health problems, the 80-year-old \"Klass's mind — and pen — remain razor sharp, to the delight of his grateful followers and to the constant vexation (or worse) of his legions of detractors.\"\n\nKlass was born November 8, 1919, in Des Moines, Iowa, to Raymond Klass and Anne Traxler, and grew up in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. His father was a lawyer recognized throughout the United States as an expert on automobile negligence law. As a Boy Scout he won a ride in an autogyro (an early helicopter) at the Iowa State Fair, and his younger sister, Rosanne Klass, also recalled that he spent a lot of time building crystal radios. He graduated from Iowa State College in 1941 with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering.\n\nKlass moved from the Midwest to Washington, D.C., when he went to work for \"Aviation Week\". Between maintaining his journalistic responsibilities and keeping up with claims from the UFO community, Klass spent much of his adult life as a loner and workaholic. He married at age 60. His wife, Nadya, was six years his junior and worked for the Bulgaria service of Voice of America. They had no children of their own, but Nadya had a son who escaped with her from communist Bulgaria in 1973.\n\nFor ten years, Klass worked for General Electric as an engineer in aviation electronics. Dissatisfied with his job, in 1952 he moved to Washington, DC, and joined \"Aviation Week\", which later became \"Aviation Week & Space Technology\". He was a senior editor of \"Aviation Week & Space Technology\" for thirty-four years.\n\nAlways striving to stay on the cutting edge, Klass published an \"Exclusive Report on Counter Measures\" in the November 18 and 25, 1957, editions of \"Aviation Week\". This report was referred to the FBI for the \"unauthorized disclosure of information classified 'Secret'\". An investigation into the disclosure was dropped when the US Air Force told the FBI that the disclosed information could not be declassified for purposes of prosecution.\n\nKlass wrote some of the first articles on inertial guidance systems, infrared missile guidance, and microelectronics. \n\nDeclassified National Reconnaissance Office documents including a history of the Hexagon Project illustrate Klass's impact on the aerospace industry: His book \"Secret Sentries in Space\" (1971) was one of the first books about spy-satellite technology.\n\nIn 1973 Klass was named a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. He also was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the now-defunct Aviation/Space Writers Association, the National Press Club, and the National Aviation Club. Asteroid 7277 (1983 RM2) was named \"Klass\" after him. He received the Lauren D. Lyman Award in 1989 from the Aviation/Space Writers Association for distinguished career-long achievements, and the Boeing Decade of Excellence Award for lifetime achievement in 1998 from the Royal Aeronautical Society.\n\nRetiring in 1986 as senior avionics editor of \"Aviation Week & Space Technology\", he continued to contribute to the magazine for several more years.\n\nKlass's involvement in the UFO field can be traced to his reading of journalist John G. Fuller's \"Incident at Exeter\" (1966), about a series of UFO sightings in and around Exeter, New Hampshire. Noting that many of the Exeter UFO incidents took place close to high-power electric lines, Klass suspected that the UFO reports were best explained as a previously unknown type of plasma or ball lightning that might have been generated from the power lines or their transformers. A plasma, thought Klass, could be consistent with many UFO reports of bright lights moving erratically; a highly charged plasma might further explain the reported effects of UFOs on the electrical systems of airplanes and automobiles. Klass wrote up his theory in a review of Fuller's book which was published in Aviation Week. This was followed by another skeptical review of work by the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). These articles garnered Klass tremendous attention within the UFO community, and, as Howard Blum put it, \"... as if overnight, he had been christened by both friends and foes 'the country's leading UFO debunker'\".\n\nKlass initially applied his ball lightning theory cautiously and selectively in a series of magazine articles. He and physicist James E. McDonald exchanged cordial letters on the subject, and McDonald agreed that some UFOs might be a type of ball lighting. However, in his first book on the subject, Klass argued that plasmas could explain most or all UFOs, even cases of alleged alien abduction.\n\nKlass's plasma hypothesis was not well received by those on either side of the UFO debate, who noted that Klass was using one unverified phenomenon—his hypothetical plasmas— to explain another unverified phenomenon—UFOs. The two engaged in a bitter, months-long debate, leveling a variety of charges and accusations at one another. Eventually, Klass wrote to McDonald's superiors at the U.S. Navy (McDonald was formally retired from the Navy, but often worked with the Office of Naval Research), questioning how McDonald could spend so much time on UFO research and still fulfill the requirements for his atmospheric research grant. This did not result in McDonald losing ONR funding but did draw some criticism of Klass from members of the UFO community.\n\nCriticism was also expressed by a more skeptical team of plasma experts assembled by the Condon Committee, all of whom rejected Klass's plasma theory as unscientific. Since that time, theories evoking similar phenomena with widely differing modes of generation have been proposed by commentators such as Michael Persinger, Terence Meaden, Albert Budden, and Paul Devereux. In 1999 the MoD Project Condign report proposed that \"Unidentified Aerial Phenomena\" (UAPs) comparable to the plasmas originally advocated by Klass (but as amended by Devereux and Randles) may represent a viable explanation for some UFO events. Therefore, while his original concept was discredited, it has been adapted by others, and in this regard Klass is regarded as a pioneer of this approach.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Klass quietly abandoned his plasma theory and afterwards argued that all UFO sightings could be explained as misidentification of normal phenomena (such as clouds, stars, comets, or airplanes) and/or as hoaxes. Jerome Clark contends that Klass argued in favor of hoaxes more than almost any other UFO skeptic, but that Klass rarely had evidence in favor of his accusations; this position was echoed by Don Ecker, who asserted that during a 1992 debate, Klass made unsubstantiated charges of \"drug smuggling\" against Australian pilot Frederick Valentich, who disappeared in 1978 after claiming a strange UFO was flying near his airplane.\n\nKlass was a founding fellow of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP, now the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI)) and served on its executive council and UFO subcommittee. He conducted a number of skeptic-centered reports on UFOs and UFO sightings. He published the bimonthly \"Skeptics UFO Newsletter\" for several years and wrote several books on the subject (see below).\n\nIn the 1970s, Klass heaped praise on astronomer and UFO investigator Allan Hendry's \"The UFO Handbook\", but Hendry objected strongly to Klass's \"modus operandi\", which Hendry argued consisted of suppressing and distorting evidence, unscientific reasoning, \"ad hominem\" attacks, smear campaigns, scientific bait and switch tactics, and seemingly refusing to evaluate evidence that conflicted with his preconceptions. Nuclear physicist and UFO researcher Stanton T. Friedman also frequently jousted with Klass.\n\nKlass's modus operandi when dealing with opponents such as Friedman was exceptional. He seemed to have an acute understanding of his position in both his career and his hobby and the power that position afforded him. When he learned of Friedman's plans to move to Canada in 1980, Klass wrote a letter to A.G. McNamara with the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics at the National Research Council in Ottawa. For decades the NRC had been the unwilling recipient of UFO reports collected by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The NRC did not research the reports they received; they merely classified them as \"meteorite\" or \"non-meteorite\" and filed them. The purpose of Klass's letter was to bring \"bad tidings\" - that Stanton Friedman was moving to Canada. Klass warned that Friedman would begin accusing them of UFO coverups. He then went on to smear Friedman's professionalism, while simultaneously claiming to be Friedman's friend when discussing topics other than UFOs. Ten days later a memo was sent within the NRC management which said, \"I don't know what we can do to prepare for the arrival in Canada of this man Friedman, but if he acts as Klass predicts we can ill afford the publicity he will generate for us.\" The decision was made quickly to turn over all UFO reports older than a year to the Public Archives of Canada. Klass's single letter apparently prompted a major records relocation in Canada and subsequently made Friedman's research easier than it otherwise might have been.\n\nKlass was correct in that Friedman did indeed begin studying the Canadian UFO records and did accuse the Canadian government of covering up information. In an undated paper on the Canadian UFO situation in Canada, Friedman charged that \"two government-sponsored investigative bodies\" had covered up UFO information, and the government had \"hidden or destroyed\" further information. In the same paper Friedman also told a different version of the events leading to the Canadian UFO records being moved to the public archives. He claims that efforts by a \"Canadian researcher\" with the legal name of Mr. X and Friedman himself were responsible for having the records transferred.\n\nAuthor Michael Sokolove wrote in his article \"The Debunkers\": \"Klass was the voice of cool reason, seeking to demonstrate that a temporary inability to fill in the whole story should not open the door to wild speculation. His real argument, like all debunkers', was not with the people who believed that they had witnessed or experienced some paranormal event but with those who made an industry of igniting their imaginations.\"\n\nKlass was willing to argue for his opinions wherever he perceived a challenge. In February 1975 he called the editor of the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin and \"in strong terms laced with sarcasm he derided our publication of the article by J. Allen Hynek, 'The UFO Mystery'\". Klass accused the FBI of perpetuating a hoax in the form of extraterrestrial UFOs and referred to Hynek as a fraud. The editor explained to Klass that at no point did Hynek say that UFOs were extraterrestrial in origin, and that UFOs present a unique problem for law enforcement as they are often the first people called when a UFO is spotted. The editor also defended Hynek as a \"widely respected scientist... affiliated with a leading university\", to which Klass replied, \"He won't be for long!\" Klass followed up with a letter to the LEB offering a rebuttal article, but the offer was declined.\n\nIn 1987, Klass first saw the Majestic 12 documents. These were a set of documents \"discovered\" by ufologist Bill Moore and his associate, television producer Jaime Shandera. The documents appeared to prove a government cover-up of an alien crash at Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. Klass immediately doubted the authenticity of the documents and set about trying to prove his suspicions. Klass was able to raise numerous questions about each document, but after several months he realized that only the government was in a position to debunk them. In late 1987 Klass wrote to the FBI to inform them that Moore was distributing what appeared to be top secret documents. This prompted a lengthy investigation, but definitive proof was never forthcoming from that investigation. In the end the consensus sided with Klass, with Friedman being the only central figure in the controversy to maintain the documents' authenticity. Klass did find then-classified documents that failed to mention anything about aliens.\n\nIn Gary Posner's 1999 interview, Klass explained his views on UFOs: \"As I turn 80, my fondest hope is that a genuine ET craft will land on our back patio and that I will be abducted. Hopefully, with the ETs' advanced technology and knowledge, they will be able to cure my spinal and walking problems and the damage to my vocal cord. Of course, I would have to pay Stanton Friedman $10,000 — based on my long-standing wager that UFOs will never be proven real — but I would expect to become wealthy from the royalties of a new book titled \"Why Me, ET?\". And instead of spending many hours each week 'debunking' UFOs, I'll finally have time to watch some TV, go to the movies, and perhaps get to read a few non-UFO books for enjoyment.\"\n\nIn 1966, Klass made an offer that stood for the remaining thirty-nine years of his life. By 1974, the offer had changed slightly, to the following form:\n\nKlass made this offer openly to anyone. The offer was specifically declined by Frank Edwards, John G. Fuller, J. Allen Hynek, and James Harder, some of whom were the most vocal promoters of the extraterrestrial hypothesis. One person entered into the agreement with Klass. A man in Seattle, Washington, accepted the terms in 1969 and made two annual payments of $100. Then in 1971 he wrongly claimed the prize. When it was pointed out that his claim didn't meet any of the conditions, the man let the agreement lapse. In his book \"UFOs Explained\", Klass offered to refund the full purchase price to every reader of the book if any of the conditions of his \"UFO challenge\" were ever met.\n\nIn another challenge, Klass claimed lexicographic inconsistencies based on the use of Pica typeface in the Cutler/Twining memo and offered $100 to Stanton Friedman for each legitimate example of the use of the same style and size Pica type as used in the memo. Friedman provided 14 examples and was paid $1,000 by Klass.\n\nKlass left this statement, originally published in Moseley's newsletter \"Saucer Smear\" on October 10, 1983.\nIn 1994 the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) presented Klass with their \"Distinguished Skeptic\" Award.\n\nIn April 2011 CSI honored Klass again. At a meeting of the executive council of the Committee in Denver, Colorado, Klass was selected for inclusion in CSI's Pantheon of Skeptics. The Pantheon of Skeptics was created by CSI to remember the legacy of deceased fellows of CSI and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism.\n\n\"Aviation Week\" holds an annual ceremony at which they present an award named for Klass. The Philip J. Klass Award for Lifetime Achievement cuts across all categories and criteria. The winner might be a scientist, pilot, engineer, technology specialist, business or industry leader—someone whose accomplishments will be the products of a long and varied career of service, creativity, and vision, and who has achieved widespread professional recognition and respect. The award was first presented in 1995, and recipients have included:\n\nEach year the National Capital Area Skeptics in Silver Spring, Maryland, presents the Philip J. Klass Award \"for outstanding contributions in critical thinking and scientific understanding.\" Recipients have included:\n\nKlass died of cancer in Cocoa, Florida, on August 9, 2005, after moving to Merritt Island, Florida, in 2003.\n\n\n\n"}

They wrestled in the World Wrestling Federation, Jim Crockett Promotions, and on the independent territorial wrestling circuits. The Bushwhackers consisted of Butch Miller and Luke Williams while the Sheepherders also included Jonathan Boyd and Rip Morgan as members at times. Williams and Miller were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2015.\n\nLuke Williams and Butch Miller started wrestling as \"The Kiwis\" for NWA New Zealand (later known as All-Star Pro Wrestling) in 1966, where they achieved a great deal of regional success. After working Australasia and the Eastern Circuit (Singapore, Malaysia, Japan), the duo was booked in North America in \"Grand Prix\" (Quebec, The Maritimes, Ontario, Vermont), a promotion owned by the Vachon family and Edouard Carpentier, in 1972 by fellow New Zealander Steve Rickard.\n\nWilliams and Miller worked in Canada for various promotions, most notably Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling, billed as The Kiwis (Miller was known as \"Nick Carter\" and Williams was known as \"Sweet William\"). The Kiwis began their first recorded title reign by defeating Bob Pringle and Bill Cody for the Stampede International Tag Team Championship on 6 January 1974. The Kiwis lost the title to Tokyo Joe and the Great Saki, only to regain it a short time later. The Kiwis lost the title for good to Stan Kowalski and Duke Savage and were unsuccessful in subsequent rematches. They returned to their home country of New Zealand in late 1975 for the first wrestling television tapings \"On the Mat\".\n\nThey reunited in New Zealand in late 1978. They made a stop for All Japan Pro Wrestling in 1979. Returning to North America in late 1979, they worked for 50th State Big Time Wrestling. Later the same year, they moved to Oregon to work for Don Owen's Pacific Northwest Wrestling, working from Northern California to Vancouver, where they had a year-long feud with Roddy Piper and Rick Martel. This was when their name changed to \"The New Zealand Sheepherders\".\n\nTheir next stop was NWA Crockett Promotions in Charlotte, North Carolina. They won the Mid-Atlantic Tag Team titles on their third weekend in the territory from Buzz Sawyer and Matt Borne. They later lost the belts to Rocky Johnson and Dewey Robertson.\n\nThe Sheepherders then worked for the World Wrestling Council (WWC) in 1981 as \"Los Pastores\". A short time into their run with WWC, they defeated Carlos Colon and Invader I for the WWC North American Tag Team Championship, defending it for over a month until being defeated by Los Medicos. Los Pastores regained the belts on 22 May and held them until coming up short against Jack and Jerry Brisco on 8 August 1981.\n\nAfter the team left WWC, Miller decided he wanted to move closer to home to be with family and returned to Australia and New Zealand to wrestle. Williams remained in the United States, reforming the team with \"Lord\" Jonathan Boyd. The duo of Williams and Boyd quickly gained a reputation as one of the most violent, hard-hitting teams in the business. In late 1981 in South Eastern Championship Wrestling, the team of Robert Fuller and Jos LeDuc had split up after LeDuc turned on Fuller during a match. LeDuc brought in the Sheepherders to be a part of his Commonwealth Connection stable to fight against Fuller and his family. In December 1981, the Sheepherders won the NWA Southeast Tag Team Championship, which had been vacated when Fuller and LeDuc split and defended the title against Fuller and various partners. On 11 September 1982, the Sheepherders lost to Fuller and Jimmy Golden and were \"run out\" of the territory.\n\nBoyd and Williams next appeared in the Memphis, TN-based promotion Continental Wrestling Association run by Jerry Jarrett and Jerry Lawler. Making their debut in October 1982, the team quickly became involved in a feud with Jacques Rougeau and Terry Taylor, clashing weekly with them at the Mid-South Coliseum, with the Sheepherders brawling their way to victory. Taylor and Rougeau redeemed themselves in the end by defeating the Sheepherders in a \"coal miner's glove\" match. The Sheepherders returned to the ring later that same night and defeated the territory's main stars Jerry Lawler and Bill Dundee.\n\nThe next feud of Boyd and Williams was with The Fabulous Ones (Stan Lane and Steve Keirn). The contrast between the \"pretty boy\"-styled, technically polished Fabulous Ones and the ugly, brawling savage Sheepherders made them effective opponents and repeatedly drew big crowds wherever they fought. The series of matches started out fairly evenly, with the Fabulous Ones and the Sheepherders splitting the wins. Later, bouts often ended without a definite winner. In late 1982, the Sheepherders won the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship from The Fabulous Ones. Between late December 1982 and mid-February 1983, the title switched hands between the teams four times, with The Fabulous Ones ending up champions in the end. On 28 March 1983, the Sheepherders wrestled their last match in the Mid-South Coliseum before leaving the CWA.\n\nBoyd and Williams resurfaced in Southwest Championship Wrestling (SWCW) only weeks later. Their first targets were the reigning Southwest Tag Team Champions The Grapplers (Len Denton and Tony Anthony). In May 1983, the Sheepherders captured the title when The Grapplers' manager Don Carson turned on them mid-match to ensure the Sheepherders' victory. The Sheepherders' run with the gold was short-lived; in June, Boyd legitimately broke his leg in a car accident, causing SWCW to name Bobby Jaggers as his replacement. After Williams and Jaggers lost a non-title match to Bob Sweetan and Sweet Brown Sugar, Williams turned on Jaggers and the title was vacated. While Boyd was out with the broken leg, Williams was reunited with his old tag-team partner Butch Miller.\n\nWilliams and Miller stayed with SWCW through the rest of 1983, and into 1984, when the team came head to head with the Fabulous Ones once again, feuding over the SWCW World Tag Team Championship. The Fabulous Ones had supposedly won the title in Australia, though it is generally believed the tournament they won to be crowned was actually a fabrication made up by SWCW. The Sheepherders dethroned The Fabulous Ones on 4 March and held the titles until they were retired by SWCW in September 1984. Miller and Williams then returned to Puerto Rico and the WWC, this time competing as The Sheepherders (Los Pastores). On 6 January 1985 they defeated Invader I and Invader III for the WWC North American Tag Team Championship in Bayamon, PR. They lost and then regained the titles from Invaders I & III in March, and then held on to the gold until August, when the Invaders won it back.\n\nWhile the Sheepherders were in Puerto Rico, another Sheepherders team was spreading destruction all over the CWA in Memphis. For the first time, a Sheepherder team existed without Luke Williams as a member, as Jonathan Boyd teamed up with Rip Morgan (former flag bearer for the Sheepherders & nephew to Butch Miller) under the name \"The Kiwi Sheepherders\". Boyd and Morgan defeated their recurring nemeses, the Fabulous Ones, for the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship on 17 June 1985. In the storyline, the team was soon stripped of the titles due to their excessive cheating, but had the titles returned to them when they threatened to sue CWA management. The Fabulous Ones took them by beating them four times in a row between 5 September and 12 October.\n\nThe Kiwi Sheepherders then began feuding with another team: The Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Tommy Rogers). In the winter of 1985, the Kiwi Sheepherders and the Fantastics traded wins back and forth with no side gaining a clear advantage in the feud. In January 1986, the Kiwi Sheepherders defeated the team of Koko Ware and Rick Casey as well as team of Tojo Yamamoto and Dirty Rhodes to reach the finals of a tournament to crown new Southern Tag Team Champions, but they fell in the finals to the Fantastics. The feud culminated as the two teams clashed in a \"No DQ Loser Leaves Town\" match on 20 January 1986. The Kiwi Sheepherders lost and left Memphis, while the Fantastics rode a new wave of popularity gained from the feud.\n\nWhen Williams and Miller returned to mainland USA and Bill Watts' UWF, they defeated Ted DiBiase and Steve Williams for the UWF Tag Team Championship on 16 March 1986, but fell to The Fantastics on 30 March in Tulsa, OK. The Sheepherders continued for the UWF on and off over the next couple of years, taking time out to participate in the first-ever Jim Crockett Memorial Tag Team Cup, in which they beat Hector and Chavo Guerrero Sr. in the first round and The Rock 'n' Roll Express in the second round. In the third round, they clashed with the Fantastics in a match that ended in a double DQ. Back in the UWF for its big \"Mid South Superdome Show\", The Sheepherders clashed with The Fantastics once more; this time Williams and Miller lost in a \"New Zealand Boot camp\" match to the UWF Tag champions.\n\nAfter being unable to beat the Fantastics in several rematches, The Sheepherders returned to Puerto Rico during the summer of 1986 and beat the Rock’N’Roll RPMs (Mike Davis and Tommy Lane) for the WWC World Tag Team Championship on 3 August. They defended the titles for about six weeks before losing them to the RPMs on 21 September. When this short run with the WWC ended, Williams and Miller traveled to Florida where they worked for Championship Wrestling from Florida. On 7 October, The Sheepherders ended The Fabulous Ones' first reign with the NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship, but Lane and Keirn got the better of them on 30 November, regaining the belts.\n\nThe Sheepherders then returned to the CWA Memphis territory. On 10 January, they beat Badd Company (Pat Tanaka and Paul Diamond) for the CWA/AWA International Tag Team Championship but lost it to Badd Company as fast as they had won it. After the quick feud with Badd Company, The Sheepherders once again feuded with the Fabulous Ones. Keirn and Lane dominated the matches and once again \"ran off\" the Sheepherders.\n\nAfter leaving Memphis, The Sheepherders were invited to participate in New Japan Pro Wrestling's \"IWGP Tag Team Title League 1987\". The round-robin tournament took place from 23 February to 20 March. They only had a brief stay with New Japan, opting to return to Puerto Rico and the WWC. Here they started a feud with Chris and Mark Youngblood. The feud saw Williams and Miller win the WWC World Tag Team Championship on 4 April, and then defend it until the Youngbloods regained the titles on 10 May in a steel cage match.\n\nAfter their spring run with the WWC, The Sheepherders returned to Florida and instantly became challengers for Mike Graham and Steve Keirn's NWA Florida Tag Team Championship. On 26 June 1987, they won the championship. A month later, The Sheepherders defended their Florida Tag Team title at The Great American Bash from the Miami Orange Bowl, brawling to a double disqualification with Jimmy and Ron Garvin. Their run with the title came to an end on 29 August at the hands of Graham and Keirn.\n\nAfter losing the Florida titles, Williams and Miller returned to the UWF and began a second run as the UWF World Tag Team Championship after defeating the Lightning Express (Brad Armstrong and Tim Horner) on 16 October. The Sheepherders held the belts until the UWF was purchased by Jim Crockett and merged into Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), to form the forerunner of World Championship Wrestling (WCW). After this merger, The Sheepherders worked for JCP, participating in the third Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Tag Team Tournament Cup. At Clash of the Champions II, they faced off against the NWA United States Tag Team Champions, The Fantastics, in a losing effort. At Clash of the Champions III, they lost to Steve Williams and Nikita Koloff, despite the interference of Rip Morgan on their behalf. Just as it looked like the Sheepherders were about to face the Fantastics in the finals of a tournament to crown new United States Tag Team champions, Luke Williams and Butch Miller signed with Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF).\n\nIn December 1988, Williams and Miller debuted with the WWF in the midst of its aggressive national expansion. The team's name was changed to \"The Bushwhackers\" and developed a more comedic style. The comedy act involved licking (each other, fans, and even their opponents), as well as using their existing distinctive march, swinging their flexed arms. The Bushwhackers made their WWF in-ring debut on 3 January 1989 at a \"Superstars of Wrestling\" taping.\n\nOnly a few days into their run with the WWF, the Bushwhackers had their first match with The Bolsheviks (Boris Zhukov and Nikolai Volkoff). In February, the Bushwhackers began a feud with The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers, the first feud to really feature the Bushwhackers on WWF television. The two teams took their conflict to WrestleMania V where the Bushwhackers were victorious. The teams clashed again on the \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXIII\", and once again the Bushwhackers were victorious. The Bushwhackers defeated the Rougeaus twice more, first at the 1989 Survivor Series and again at the 1990 Royal Rumble.\n\nThe Bushwhackers quickly became one of the most popular duos among the viewers, chiefly due to the wildly comedic nature of their antics (including their trademark \"Bushwhacker walk\"), their pastoral musical theme, and their friendly interaction with the audience. By 1990, the Bushwhackers were feuding with the newly established team Rhythm and Blues (The Honky Tonk Man and Greg Valentine). The Bushwhackers' WrestleMania VI appearance came at the expense of Rhythm and Blues as they showed up during a segment, attacking Honky Tonk Man and Valentine. Later on, the team would be used to help establish newcomers The Orient Express (Pat Tanaka and Akio Sato). The feud with the Orient Express culminated at Survivor Series 1990 where Williams and Miller teamed up with Nikolai Volkoff and Tito Santana to form \"The Alliance\" and take on Sgt. Slaughter, Boris Zhukov and the Orient Express team dubbed \"The Mercenaries\".\n\nThe Bushwhackers received a shot at the WWF World Tag Team Title on the 27 April \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXIX\" against The Nasty Boys, but were defeated. In a televised 6-man tag-team match the Bushwhackers teamed with Tugboat against Earthquake and the Nasty Boys, Tugboat turned on his partners after a few minutes of action and joined Earthquake in attacking the two New Zealanders. After the heel turn Tugboat changed his name to Typhoon and together they became known as The Natural Disasters. The Bushwhackers were easily defeated at SummerSlam 1991 by the team.\n\nTheir next feud was with the Beverly Brothers (Blake and Beau). The two teams first clashed at the 1991 Survivor Series where they were on opposite sides in a 4 on 4 elimination match. On the night the Beverly Brothers got the upper hand and eliminated both Williams and Miller. The Beverly Brothers' manager The Genius kept interfering in the matches so the Bushwhackers brought in a manager of their own, Jamison. Despite the addition of Jamison, the Beverly Brothers defeated the Bushwhackers at Royal Rumble 1992. The Bushwhackers did gain some small measure of revenge on the Beverly Brothers when they defeated the team in a \"dark match\" at WrestleMania VIII. Luke and Butch continued their feud with the Beverlys throughout the spring and summer of 1992, generally coming out victorious in these encounters.\n\nOn the 23 August 1992 \"SummerSlam Spectacular\" show that preceded the PPV in the United Kingdom, the Bushwhackers received a title shot against WWF Tag-Tam Champions Money Incorporated. However, in this match, which aired on the USA Network, they fell short as Irwin R. Schyster pinned Butch following interference by Jimmy Hart. Their next PPV appearance came at SummerSlam '92, where they tag-teamed with Jim Duggan on the pre-show (in a match that was subsequently aired on Prime Time Wrestling) and defeated The Mountie and The Nasty Boys. They were slated to team with The Natural Disasters against Money Inc. and The Beverly Brothers at the 1992 Survivor Series; however on the 7 November edition of WWF Superstars they agreed to let former Jimmy Hart charges The Nasty Boys take their place after the duo turned on their manager. The Bushwhackers concluded the year by resuming their long-running feud with the Beverly Brothers on house shows, this time teaming with Tiger Jackson against Beau, Blake, and Little Mickey Moses in six-man matches.\n\nThe Bushwhackers opened 1993 with another opportunity against WWF Tag-Team Champions Money Inc. Once again they were defeated, this time on a 25 January taping of \"WWF Superstars\" in San Jose, California. Beginning in February they began a new feud with the newly signed team the Headshrinkers (Fatu and Samu), and were used to \"put over\" the team. Following a winless stretch against Fatu and Samu, the Bushwhackers restarted their now over year old rivalry with the Beverly Brothers. As in late 1992, these were comedy matches alongside midget Tiger Jackson against the Beverly Brothers and Little Louie. On 22 March 1993 the Bushwhackers appeared on \"Monday Night RAW\", defeating Damien Demento and The Repo Man. This would be Luke and Butch's first \"RAW\" appearance; meanwhile, it would be the final WWF appearance for Repo Man (Barry Darsow).\n\nIn August, the Bushwhackers made a quick trip to Puerto Rico to appear at the WWC 20th Anniversary show on 8 August where they defeated the team of Mr. Hughes and The Warlord. When the team returned to the US, Williams and Miller gave the new WWF duo The Quebecers their first defeat when Butch pinned Jacques Rougeau on the 23 August 1993 edition of All American Wrestling. In the fall of 1993 they transitioned to a feud with another new team, this time facing Well Dunn in a house show series. In November 1993 they helped Doink the Clown in the clown's feud with Bam Bam Bigelow. Williams and Miller, as well as Mo and Mabel, all appeared at Survivor Series 1993 wearing the trademark green wig and face paint associated with Doink the Clown. The Bushwhackers and Men on a Mission defeated Bigelow, Bastion Booger and the Headshrinkers.\n\nIn March 1994, the Bushwhackers started feuding with SMW Tag-Team Champions The Heavenly Bodies (Tom Prichard and Jimmy Del Ray). Williams and Miller were undefeated against the Bodies until WrestleMania X, where they lost a dark match. In April they began a house show series with WWF Tag-Team Champions The Quebecers, but unlike the previous year the team was winless against Rougeau and Oullette. In the summer of 1994 they reversed fortunes and were undefeated against the preliminary tag-team The Executioners (Dwayne Gill and Barry Hardy). They finished the year defeating Well Dunn in numerous house show encounters, although at this point their opponents were little more than preliminary opposition. However, now five years into their tenure into the company, and their prospects for a world championship run had seemed to close.\n\nThe WWF was entering a \"New Generation\" era in 1995, and the Bushwhackers were now one of the last legacy acts. Still quite popular with the fanbase, they began the year with a successful series of encounters on the house show circuit against The Heavenly Bodies. Both Luke and Butch appeared in the 1995 Royal Rumble as separate participants. They continued to wrestle throughout the spring, defeating the Bodies and Well Dunn and remaining undefeated against preliminary opposition on television. However, their appearances became far more sporadic in the second half of 1995 following WWF touring cutbacks. They would wrestle only five more times that year, losing to WWF Tag-Team Champions Owen Hart and Yokozuna and the newly arrived Blu Twins.\n\nIn March 1996, the Bushwhackers returned to the WWF after a six-month hiatus to participate in a tournament to crown new tag team champions. The Bushwhackers were beaten in the first round by eventual winners The Bodydonnas (Skip and Zip). When the Bushwhackers returned in 1996, they displayed traditional Australian stereotypes, including being accompanied to the ring by a giant kangaroo mascot. On 14 September, the Bushwhackers made their last appearance while under contract with the WWF, defeating Justin Bradshaw and Uncle Zebakiah at a house show.\n\nAfter leaving the WWF, the team made special appearances in the independent circuit, including a return to WWC for its 24th Anniversary show, where they were billed as the Sheepherders and took on old rivals, Invaders I & II. They also appeared at a special event in Amarillo to celebrate \"50 years of Funk\" where they lost to old rivals Mark and Chris Youngblood. In 1998, they made a couple of appearances in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) under the names Luke and Butch Dudley as \"cousins\" of The Dudley Brothers. In 1999, the Bushwhackers participated in Heroes of Wrestling, where Williams and Miller took on and defeated former WWF Tag Team Champions, The Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff.\n\nWilliams and Miller made one of their last appearances as active wrestlers on 1 April 2001 when they participated in the WrestleMania X-Seven \"Gimmick Battle Royal\". On 15 June the team returned to Memphis one last time, fighting The Moondogs to a double disqualification on a special \"Mid-South Clash of the Legends\" show. During this period, they toured the UK with All Star Wrestling, often appearing in six-man tag matches teamed with Frank Casey, who had been wrestling for several years as the \"British Bushwhacker\" – a 'tribute' to Williams and Miller.\n\nOn 23 February 2015, it was announced by WWE that The Bushwhackers would be 2015 inductees into the WWE Hall of Fame. On 28 March 2015, they both attended the event to accept their induction.\n\nThe Bushwhackers appeared as themselves in a 1994 episode of the sitcom \"Family Matters\", wrestling against Carl Winslow and Steve Urkel, who are forced to fill in for and wrestle as The Psycho Twins. They also appeared in the 1998 \"How Many Times\" music video for the Insane Clown Posse.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2100423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100423", "title": "Vauxhall Gardens", "text": "Vauxhall Gardens\n\nVauxhall Gardens is a public park in Kennington, London, England, on the south bank of the River Thames.\n\nFrom 1785 to 1859, the site was a pleasure garden and one of the leading venues for public entertainment in London from the mid-17th century to the mid-19th century. Originally known as New Spring Gardens, it is believed to have opened before the Restoration of 1660, being mentioned by Samuel Pepys in 1662. The Gardens consisted of several acres of trees and shrubs with attractive walks. Initially entrance was free, with food and drink being sold to support the venture.\n\nIt was accessed by boat until the erection of Vauxhall Bridge in the 1810s. The area was absorbed into the metropolis as the city expanded in the early to mid-19th century.\n\nThe site became Vauxhall Gardens in 1785 and admission was charged for its attractions. The Gardens drew enormous crowds, with its paths being noted for romantic assignations. Tightrope walkers, hot-air balloon ascents, concerts and fireworks provided entertainment. The rococo \"Turkish tent\" became one of the Gardens' structures, the interior of the Rotunda became one of Vauxhall's most viewed attractions, and the \"chinoiserie\" style was a feature of several buildings. A statue depicting George Frideric Handel in the Gardens later found its way to Westminster Abbey. In 1817, the Battle of Waterloo was re-enacted, with 1,000 soldiers participating.\n\nIt closed in 1840 after its owners suffered bankruptcy, but re-opened in 1841. It changed hands in 1842, and was permanently closed in 1859. The land was redeveloped in the following decades, but slum clearance in the late 20th century saw part of the original site opened up as a public park. This was initially called Spring Gardens and renamed in 2012 as Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens. It is managed as a public park by the London Borough of Lambeth.\n\nVauxhall Gardens is depicted in a tile motif at Vauxhall tube station by George Smith.\n\nEminent 18th-century scholar John Barrell, writing in the \"Times Literary Supplement\", brings out Vauxhall's significance. \"Vauxhall pleasure gardens, on the south bank of the Thames, entertained Londoners and visitors to London for 200 years. From 1729, under the management of Jonathan Tyers, property developer, impresario, patron of the arts, the gardens grew into an extraordinary business, a cradle of modern painting and architecture, and ... music ... A pioneer of mass entertainment, Tyers had to become also a pioneer of mass catering, of outdoor lighting, of advertising, and of all the logistics involved in running one of the most complex and profitable business ventures of the eighteenth century in Britain.\" References to Vauxhall are, for 150 years, as ubiquitous as references to \"Broadway\" later would be.\n\nThe Gardens are believed to have opened just before the Restoration of 1660, on property formerly owned by Jane Fauxe, or Vaux, widow, in 1615. Whereas John Nichols in his \"History of Lambeth Parish\" conjectures that she was the widow of Guy Fawkes, executed in 1606, John Timbs in his 1867 \"Curiosities of London\" states for a fact that there was no such connection, and that the Vaux name derives from one Falkes de Breauté, a mercenary working for King John who acquired the land by marriage. Jane is stated to be the widow of John, a vintner. Perhaps the earliest record is Samuel Pepys' description of a visit he made to the New Spring Gardens on 29 May 1662. The then name distinguished the gardens from the Old Spring Gardens at Charing Cross; however Pepys implies that there were both Old and New Spring Gardens at Vauxhall; and indeed Spring Gardens appears to have been a longstanding appellation for a variety of entertainment enterprises.\n\nThe Gardens consisted of several acres laid out with walks. Initially admission was free, the proprietors making money by selling food and drink. John Evelyn described \"the New Spring Garden at Lambeth\" as a \"very pretty contrived plantation\" in 1661. John Aubrey, in his \"Antiquities of Surrey\" gives the following account:\nAt Vauxhall, Sir Samuel Morland built a fine room, anno 1667, the inside all of looking-glass, and fountains very pleasant to behold, which is much visited by strangers: it stands in the middle of the garden, covered with Cornish slate, on the point of which he placed a punchinello, very well carved, which held a dial, but the winds have demolished it.\n\nA plan of 1681 shows the circular central feature planted with trees and shrubs, and the formal allées that were to remain a feature as long as the Gardens lasted.\n\nSir John Hawkins, in his \"General History of Music\" (1776), says:\nThe house seems to have been rebuilt since the time that Sir Samuel Morland dwelt in it. About the year 1730, Mr. Jonathan Tyers became the occupier of it, and, there being a large garden belonging to it, planted with a great number of stately trees, and laid out in shady walks, it obtained the name of Spring Gardens; and the house being converted into a tavern, or place of entertainment, was much frequented by the votaries of pleasure. Mr. Tyers opened it with an advertisement of a \"Ridotto al Fresco\", a term which the people of this country had till that time been strangers to. These entertainments were repeated in the course of the summer, and numbers resorted to partake of them. This encouraged the proprietor to make his garden a place of musical entertainment, for every evening during the summer season. To this end he was at great expense in decorating the gardens with paintings; he engaged a band of excellent musicians; he issued silver tickets at one guinea each for admission, and receiving great encouragement, he set up an organ in the orchestra, and, in a conspicuous part of the garden, erected a fine statue of Mr. Handel.\n\nThe 'supposed' last night of the gardens was on 5 September 1839 when it attracted 1089 people. Vauxhall was sold at auction on 9 September 1841 for £20,000, following bankruptcy of the owners, after which it re-opened, but it was permanently closed in 1859, and most of the land sold for building purposes.\n\nThe Spring Gardens were the most prominent vehicle in England for the public display of the new Rococo style. The earliest pictorial representation of Tyers' Spring Gardens, Vauxhall, is the \"Vauxhall fan\" (1736), an etching printed in blue designed to be pasted to a fan; it shows the earliest groups of pavilions, in a sober classical taste, but the interiors of the supper boxes were painted by members of Hogarth's St. Martin's Lane Academy, prominent among them Francis Hayman. Hayman provided most of the subjects, which were rapidly executed by students and assistants; Hubert Gravelot provided designs for two others, and Hogarth's designs were pressed into service in hastily dashed-off copies that filled the back of every box. At a certain hour, all the paintings were let down at once, to offer some security to the companies at supper and a suitable backdrop, one observer thought, for the live beauties of London. Frederick, Prince of Wales, who had come to England with his father George II in 1728 and who was a prominent patron of the Rococo, took sufficient interest in the Gardens to have his own pavilion built from the very first.\n\nThe first fully Rococo structure erected at the Spring Gardens, Vauxhall, was the \"Turkish Tent\" that was still a novelty in 1744; \"this fantastic structure introduced that element of frivolous impermanence which became so characteristic of Vauxhall,\" David Coke has remarked. In the course of the 1740s it was joined by other examples of Rococo \"chinoiserie\" and above all by the Rotunda, with the most-viewed Rococo interior decoration in England, designed by George Michael Moser, another member of the St. Martin's Lane Academy; the ornaments were \"Executed by French and Italians\" George Vertue noted.\n\nEnormous crowds could be accommodated at Spring Gardens, Vauxhall. In 1749 a rehearsal of Handel's \"Music for the Royal Fireworks\" attracted an audience of 12,000, and in 1786 a fancy-dress jubilee to celebrate the proprietor's long ownership was thronged with 61,000 revellers. Many of the best known musicians and singers of the day performed at the Gardens, for example Sophia Baddeley. In 1732, their fashionable status was confirmed by a fancy dress ball attended by Frederick, Prince of Wales. At that time access from the West End was by water, but the opening of Westminster Bridge in the 1740s made access easier though less charming.\n\nThe main walks were lit at night by thousands of lamps. Over time more features and eyecatchers were added: additional supper boxes, a music room, a Chinese pavilion, a gothic orchestra that accommodated fifty musicians, and ruins, arches, statues and a cascade. An admission charge was introduced from the beginning and later James Boswell wrote:\nVauxhall Gardens is peculiarly adapted to the taste of the English nation; there being a mixture of curious show, — gay exhibition, musick, vocal and instrumental, not too refined for the general ear; — for all of which only a shilling is paid; and, though last, not least, good eating and drinking for those who choose to purchase that regale.\n\nThe unlighted 'dark walks' or 'close walks' were known as a place for amorous adventures. Thomas Brown in \"Works Serious and Comical in Prose and Verse\" (1760) says:The ladies that have an inclination to be private, take delight in the close walks of Spring-Gardens, where both sexes meet, and mutually serve one another as guides to lose their way; and the windings and turnings in the little wildernesses are so intricate, that the most experienced mothers have often lost themselves in looking for their daughters.\" \n\nA great part of the entertainment was offered by the well-dressed company itself. Pauses between pieces of music were intentionally long enough to give the crowd time to circulate the Gardens anew. M. Grosely, in his \"Tour to London\" (1772) says, relating to Ranelagh Gardens and Vauxhall:\nThese entertainments, which begin in the month of May, are continued every night. They bring together persons of all ranks and conditions; and amongst these, a considerable number of females, whose charms want only that cheerful air, which is the flower and quintessence of beauty. These places serve equally as a rendezvous either for business or intrigue. They form, as it were, private coteries; there you see fathers and mothers, with their children, enjoying domestic happiness in the midst of public diversions. The English assert, that such entertainments as these can never subsist in France, on account of the levity of the people. Certain it is, that those of Vauxhall and Ranelagh, which are guarded only by outward decency, are conducted without tumult and disorder, which often disturb the public diversions of France. I do not know whether the English are gainers thereby; the joy which they seem in search of at those places does not beam through their countenances; they look as grave at Vauxhall and Ranelagh as at the Bank, at church, or a private club. All persons there seem to say, what a young English nobleman said to his governor, \"Am I as joyous as I should be\"?\n\nThe new name Vauxhall Gardens, long in popular use, was made official in 1785. After Boswell's time the admission charge rose steadily: to two shillings in 1792, three-and-sixpence in the early 19th century, and 4/6 in the 1820s. Season tickets were also sold. Entertainment in this period included hot-air balloon ascents, fireworks, and tightrope walkers. In 1813 there was a fête to celebrate victory at the Battle of Vitoria, and in 1827 the Battle of Waterloo was re-enacted by 1,000 soldiers.\n\nThe contributor to the \"Edinburgh Encyclopedia\" (1830 edition) comments that:\nCharles Dickens wrote of a daylight visit to Vauxhall Gardens, in \"Sketches by Boz\", published in 1836:\nWe paid our shilling at the gate, and then we saw for the first time, that the entrance, if there had been any magic about it at all, was now decidedly disenchanted, being, in fact, nothing more nor less than a combination of very roughly-painted boards and sawdust. We glanced at the orchestra and supper-room as we hurried past—we just recognised them, and that was all. We bent our steps to the firework-ground; there, at least, we should not be disappointed. We reached it, and stood rooted to the spot with mortification and astonishment. That the Moorish tower—that wooden shed with a door in the centre, and daubs of crimson and yellow all round, like a gigantic watch-case! That the place where night after night we had beheld the undaunted Mr. Blackmore make his terrific ascent, surrounded by flames of fire, and peals of artillery, and where the white garments of Madame Somebody (we forget even her name now), who nobly devoted her life to the manufacture of fireworks, had so often been seen fluttering in the wind, as she called up a red, blue, or party-coloured light to illumine her temple!\n\nThe Gardens feature in a number of other works of literature. They are the scene of a brief but pivotal turning point in the fortunes of anti-heroine Becky Sharp in Thackeray's 19th-century novel \"Vanity Fair\", as well as a setting in his novel \"Pendennis\". Thomas Hardy sets scenes in his \"The Dynasts\" in the Gardens. In \"Cecilia\" by Frances Burney the Gardens are where the character Mr Harrell commits suicide.\n\nThe Gardens passed through several hands. In 1840, the owners went bankrupt and the Gardens closed. They were revived the following year, and again in 1842 under new management, but in 1859 they closed for good.\n\nVauxhall Pleasure Gardens today is an inner-city park. The park opened in 1976 and was originally called Spring Garden, but was re-named Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens in 2012. \n\nThere is Vauxhall City Farm as well as deciduous trees and allotments. Street names in the location refer back to the historical Vauxhall Gardens - such as Jonathan Street and Tyers Street.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is the founder and president of Freedom to Marry, a group favoring same-sex marriage in the United States. Wolfson authored the book \"Why Marriage Matters: America, Equality, and Gay People's Right to Marry\", which \"Time Out New York\" magazine called, \"Perhaps the most important gay-marriage primer ever written...\" He was listed as one of \"Time\" magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World. He has taught as an adjunct professor at Columbia Law School, Rutgers Law School, and Whittier Law School and argued before the Supreme Court in \"Boy Scouts of America v. Dale\".\n\nWolfson was born in to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York and grew up in Pittsburgh. He graduated from Taylor Allderdice High School in 1974 and Yale College in 1978. At Yale, he was a resident of Silliman College, a history major, and Speaker of the Yale Political Union. After graduation he served in the Peace Corps in Togo, in western Africa. He returned and entered Harvard Law School, where he earned his \"Juris Doctor\" in 1983. Wolfson wrote his 1983 Harvard Law thesis on same-sex marriage, long before the question gained national prominence. On October 6, 2010, he returned to the Yale Political Union to debate same-sex marriage against opponent Maggie Gallagher, chairman of the National Organization for Marriage.\n\nWolfson taught political philosophy at Harvard College before he returned to his birthplace as Kings County (Brooklyn) assistant district attorney, prosecuting sex crimes and homicides, as well as serving in the Appeals Bureau. There, he wrote a Supreme Court amicus brief that helped win a nationwide ban on race discrimination in jury selection (\"Batson v. Kentucky\"). Wolfson also wrote a brief to New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals, that helped win the elimination of the marital rape exemption (\"People v. Liberta\").\n\nFollowing the District Attorney’s Office, Wolfson served as Associate Counsel to Lawrence Walsh in the Office of Independent Counsel (Iran/Contra). In 1992, he served on the New York State Task Force on Sexual Harassment.\n\nFrom 1989 until 2001 Wolfson worked full-time at Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a gay rights advocacy non-profit. He directed their Marriage Project and coordinated the National Freedom to Marry Coalition, the forerunner to Freedom to Marry. Wolfson co-wrote an amicus brief in \"Baehr v. Miike\", in which the Supreme Court of Hawaii said prohibiting same-sex marriage in the state constituted discrimination, and worked on \"Baker v. Vermont\", the Vermont Supreme Court case that led to the creation of civil unions in Vermont by the state legislature as a compromise between Wolfson's group and those objecting to same-sex marriage. Wolfson called the unions a \"wonderful step forward,\" but not enough.\n\nWolfson appeared before the United States Supreme Court on April 26, 2000, to argue on behalf of Scoutmaster James Dale in the landmark case \"Boy Scouts of America v. Dale\", in which the Court ruled that the Boy Scouts organization had the right to expel Dale for revealing that he was gay through their First Amendment rights. The justices questioned Wolfson \"aggressively.\" The Court ruled 5-4 against Dale, but Wolfson, said, \"Even before we change the [Boy Scout] policy, we are succeeding in getting people to rethink how they feel about gay people.\" Dale said of Wolfson: \"Evan understood the importance of the organization to me, and the importance of an American institution like the Boy Scouts discriminating against somebody and how that could impact the public dialogue and conversation.\"\n\nOn April 30, 2001, Wolfson left Lambda to form Freedom to Marry with a \"very generous\" grant from the Evelyn & Walter Haas Jr. Fund. Wolfson described the breadth of his vision for the new organization: \"I'm not in this just to change the law. It's about changing society. I want gay kids to grow up believing that they can get married, that they can join the Scouts, that they can choose the life they want to live.\" Lambda executive director Kevin Cathcart said that over twelve years Wolfson had \"personified Lambda's passion and vision for equality.\" Kate Kendall, executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said of her experience with Wolfson at Lambda: \"What I can now say is that, in the intervening years, what has been made unmistakably clear to me by the lesbians and gay men that we work with and represent, is that the denial of our right to marry exacerbates our marginalization; winning that right is the cornerstone of full justice.\"\n\nIn 2003 \"Time Magazine\" described him as symbolic of the gay rights movement. In his book \"Why Marriage Matters\", Wolfson calls marriage \"a relationship of emotional and financial interdependence between two people who make a public commitment.\" In 2004 \"Time\" included Wolfson on its list of the \"100 most influential people in the world.\"\n\nWolfson said of the Washington Supreme Court's 2006 decision ruling same-sex marriage unconstitutional, \"It was a splintered court. Four justices joined powerful dissents. A three-justice plurality applying the wrong standard of review—one that was undeservedly, hopelessly, and self-fulfillingly deferential—was joined by two justices in a fiery anti-gay concurrence, making up the margin of defeat.\"\n\nSome critics such as BeyondMarriage.org assert Wolfson and others' work is too narrowly focused on a limited marriage agenda. Richard Kim, signatory and founding board member of Queers for Economic Justice, disputes Wolfson's assertion that the same-sex movement is not pushing for a traditional, heterosexual model for all gays and lesbians and creating a political schism, and as such, gravely misrepresent the consequences of their own work for the past 20 years.\" Wolfson replied \"I think if Terrence McNally, Steinem and the others were actually shown some of Richard Kim’s articles as opposed to the broad, conciliatory and coalition-building goals found in that statement, they would not endorse his articles nor his views.\" In a \"New York Times\" review of \"Why Marriage Matters\", author William Saletan states what he sees as flaws in Wolfson's reasoning. \"[His] abstract theory of equality flattens...distinction...Thus he demands protection of committed gay couples not because they resemble heterosexual couples in all relevant respects but because it's wrong to discriminate against people because of their 'differences'.\" Wolfson does not favor the civil union or domestic partnership approaches, because semantic differences create \"a stigma of exclusion\" and deny gay couples \"social and other advantages.\"\n\nWolfson and his husband Cheng He, a change-management consultant with a Ph.D. in molecular biology, reside in New York City. They married in New York on October 15, 2011.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2100438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100438", "title": "Scars of Dracula", "text": "Scars of Dracula\n\nScars of Dracula is a 1970 British horror film directed by Roy Ward Baker for Hammer Films.\n\nIt stars Christopher Lee as Count Dracula, along with Dennis Waterman, Jenny Hanley, Patrick Troughton, and Michael Gwynn. Although disparaged by some critics, the film does restore a few elements of Bram Stoker's original character: the Count is introduced as an \"icily charming host;\" he has command over nature; and he is seen scaling the walls of his castle. It also gives Lee more to do and say than any other Hammer Dracula film except its first, 1958's \"Dracula\".\n\nThis film breaks the continuity maintained through the previous entries in the Hammer Dracula series: whereas at the end of the preceding film, \"Taste the Blood of Dracula\", the Count met his end in a disused church near London, this film opens with a resurrection scene set in Dracula's castle in Transylvania, with no explanation of how his ashes got there (although, they might have been returned from England, as a contingency, by the young acolyte from the prologue of \"Dracula A.D. 1972\"). Furthermore; in \"Scars of Dracula\", the Count has a servant named Klove, played by Patrick Troughton; in the third film of the series, \"\", Dracula has a servant named Klove (played by Philip Latham) who appears to a different character, though identically named. The disruption of continuity caused by \"Scars of Dracula\" reflects the fact the film was originally tooled as a possible reboot of the series in the event Christopher Lee elected not to reprise the role of Dracula.\n\nThe British Film group EMI took over distribution of the film after Warner Bros. and other American studios refused to distribute it in the U.S. It was also the first of several Hammer films to get an 'R' rating.\n\nIn the opening scene, Dracula's remains are seen lying on a stone plinth in a chamber in his Castle, having been defeated in the previous entry. The chamber can be accessed only through the window, set high in his Castle wall. It is not explained why his remains are there or how he came to die there. Suddenly, a large bat flies in and hovers over the plinth, regurgitating blood onto the vampire's remains. Almost immediately, the remains start to interact and bond with the dripped blood. Within seconds, Count Dracula is once more resurrected.\n\nSoon afterwards, the local villagers are enraged that yet another young woman has been murdered by the Count. With a priest's blessing, they rise up and set fire to Castle Dracula. However, the Count is safely asleep in his solid stone chamber, When the villagers return home, they find that every single woman and child in the village has been slaughtered in the church by bats.\n\nFalsely accused of rape by the burgomasters's spurned daughter, libertine Paul Carlson flees the Kleinenberg authorities by jumping into a nearby coach which, though driverless, heads off at great speed. He is deposited near Count Dracula's mountaintop castle. Initially he is welcomed by the Count and a beautiful woman named Tania, who later reveals herself to be imprisoned by Dracula as his mistress. Paul later has a liaison with Tania, who concludes their lovemaking by trying to bite his neck. Dracula enters and, casually throwing off Paul's efforts to stop him, savagely stabs Tania to death with a dagger for betraying him. The vampire's servant Klove dismembers her body and dissolves the pieces in a bath of acid. Locked in the room high in the castle, Paul uses tied-together bed curtains to climb down to a lower window, but the line is withdrawn by Klove, and he finds himself in the Count's chamber.\n\nPaul's more sober brother Simon Carlson, and Simon's fiancee Sarah Framsen, come searching for him. A maid at the tavern directs them to the castle and they investigate. Dracula immediately has designs on the lovely Sarah, but Klove, who has fallen in love with the young woman after seeing her photograph amongst Paul's possessions, helps the young couple escape by refusing to do Dracula's bidding and remove Sarah's crucifix. The servant pays a terrible price for his disobedience as he is sadistically burnt by Dracula with a red-hot cutlass.\n\nSimon, having enlisted the help of the village priest, goes back to the castle to look for his brother. However, the priest is attacked and killed by a large bat, and Simon is betrayed by Klove, ending up in the same locked room as his brother. Opening the coffin in the middle of the room, Simon discovers the sleeping Dracula, but the vampire's power reaches through his closed eyelids, causing the young man to collapse before he can take action against the Count.\n\nWhen Simon recovers, the vampire has vanished. Investigating the room further, he is horrified to find his brother's drained corpse on a spike. Looking out of the window, he is amazed to see the Count running up the wall outside like an insect. With a rope let down by Klove, Simon climbs up the sheer outer wall to go after Sarah, knowing that Dracula may use her as his new mistress.\n\nSarah, meanwhile, has made her way back to the castle battlements as a storm approaches. Suddenly, she is confronted by Dracula, who this time uses his bat familiar to remove her crucifix. Just then, Klove arrives on the battlements and attacks the Count with the dagger the vampire used to murder Tania, but the servant is hopelessly outmatched by the vampire's inhuman strength and is thrown over the side of the castle.\n\nSimon arrives and throws a heavy iron spike at Dracula with the intention of staking him in the heart. The spike pierces the Count, but on the wrong side of the chest. Unharmed, Dracula raises the spike to impale Simon, but the spike is struck by lightning and Dracula is immediately engulfed in flames. Staggering in agony, the Count collapses and topples over the castle's battlements, falling to the ground far below, where his corpse continues to burn fiercely...\n\n\nThe film was released theatrically by EMI Films and American Continental Films Inc. in Great Britain and the United States respectively.\n\nIt was released in some markets on a double feature with \"The Horror of Frankenstein\".\n\nThe film was released on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment in 2004. This version is currently out of production. It has since been released as part of \"The Ultimate Hammer Collection\" DVD range. The disc also features a running commentary, with Christopher Lee and director Roy Ward Baker hosted by Marcus Hearn (co-author of \"The Hammer Story\") . Also revealing are Baker's anecdotes of his arguments with BBFC executive of that time - John Trevelyan. The running time has long been erroneously stated as being up to 96 minutes, usually 95 in most books including the book \"The Hammer Story\". It is in fact short of 92 minutes listed on the Thorn EMI PAL VHS release of the 1980s. Anchor Bay's release has it correctly at 91 minutes.\n\nIn 2019 the film was re-released in the U.S. on Blu-ray by Scream Factory (a division of Shout Factory) with special features including one that discussed the making of the film.\n\nReviews from critics have been negative. Howard Thompson of \"The New York Times\", reviewing the film along with the other half of the double bill, \"Horror of Frankenstein\", stated that audiences should avoid \"Scars of Dracula\" \"like the plague,\" calling it \"garish, gory junk\". Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that the film \"simply revs up one of the most familiar Dracula plots with sex and violence,\" adding, \"Given something to work with, as in 'The Vampire Lovers,' director Roy Ward Baker can turn out an excellent film. But really all he manages to do here is keep things moving.\" \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" called it \"one of the weaker films in the Hammer Dracula cycle,\" explaining that \"most of the film is padded out with very dull and by now routine filler material, besides some rather unnecessary sadism. Even the normally powerful resurrection sequence is dealt with hastily before the credits, so there is far too little of Christopher Lee and far too much of the various young leads.\"\n\nAuthor Lyndon W. Joslin, in his book \"Count Dracula Goes to the Movies\" reviewing the many film adaptations of Dracula, wrote: \"The plummet in quality that had been threatening the Hammer Dracula series for years finally came to pass with \"Scars of Dracula,\" a garish live-action cartoon.\" John Kenneth Muir in \"Horror Films of the 1970s\" called the film \"a by-the-numbers sequel that amply demonstrates why the studio's audience was shrinking as the 1960s became the 1970s.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2100439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100439", "title": "North Midland Railway", "text": "North Midland Railway\n\nThe North Midland Railway was a British railway company, which opened its line from Derby to Rotherham (Masbrough) and Leeds in 1840.\n\nAt Derby, it connected with the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway and the Midland Counties Railway at what became known as the Tri-Junct Station. In 1844, the three companies merged to form the Midland Railway.\n\nThe East Midlands had for some years been at the centre of plans to link the major cities throughout the country.\n\nIn Yorkshire, George Hudson was the Chairman of the York and North Midland Railway, a proposed line from York towards the industrial markets of Manchester and Liverpool. The new line would connect it, and the Manchester and Leeds Railway as part of a trunk route from the South and London to Yorkshire and the North East of England. Meanwhile, financiers in Birmingham, were looking to expand their system northwards.\n\nGeorge Carr Glyn was the first Chairman of the new company, with George Stephenson appointed as engineer. George Stephenson surveyed the line in 1835 with his secretary, Charles Binns. It would be long, meeting the York and North Midland, at Normanton, and also the projected Manchester and Leeds Railway. It received Royal Assent on 4 July 1836.\n\nStephenson decided the line would follow the river valleys from Derby to Leeds, with minimal gradients and large radii curves. It therefore bypassed Sheffield, but met the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway at Masbrough.\n\nHis method of working was to follow river valleys as far as possible, with branches into major towns along the way. The Sheffield people, in lobbying for the line to enter their city, engaged Joseph Locke, who believed lines should pass through towns, proceeding along hills, if necessary, with bridges, embankments and cuttings. These were the two opposing schools of thought at the time and, in this case, Stephenson had his way.\n\nAn additional advantage was that his customers would, in most cases, be transporting their goods downhill from the mines and quarries to the railhead. It should be said, however, that the North Midland was among the first of the new breed of railway conceived as a means of improved passenger travel between the great cities, particularly London, rather than, like the Midland Counties and earlier lines, an adjunct to coal mines and quarries. Indeed, the rise in the coal trade, which was to become so important to the railways, had barely begun and, even a few years later, directors of the Midland Railway were questioning whether the revenue made it a worthwhile market to pursue.\n\nIn 1870 the Midland Railway opened a diversion through Dronfield and Sheffield, which became known to railwaymen as the \"New Road\", as opposed to the \"Old Road\". It followed a route which, in 1840, would have been uneconomic to build and difficult to work.\n\nNevertheless, the terrain was more difficult than for the other two railways to Derby, requiring 200 bridges and seven tunnels, and an aqueduct for the railway to pass underneath the Cromford Canal. By that time, Stephenson, who was wishing to concentrate in exploiting the coal around Ashby-de-la-Zouch, delegated the responsibility for almost the entire work of its design and construction to his engineer Frederick Swanwick.\n\nThe major bridges were at Oakenshaw, over the Barnsley Canal, and the Calder and Chevet Viaducts. In addition there were massive stone retaining walls for the cutting through Belper and the embankment north of Ambergate. Although the general radius of curves was , gradients were as steep as 1 in 264 and practically the whole length was embanked or in cuttings, when not proceeding through a tunnel. The number of men employed was 8,600, with eighteen pumping engines providing drainage. It was tough work and a number of lives were lost, particularly in the boring of the Clay Cross Tunnel. It must be said, however, that some of them were due to carelessness with blasting powder.\n\nThe track was gauge either single or double parallel (see Rail track), the former , the latter . A mixture of stone blocks and timber sleepers were used.\n\nNot all the stations shown above were open at the beginning. The original intermediate stations were , , , , , , , , , , , and . All were designed by Francis Thompson. Although praising their design, Whishaw was somewhat critical: \"we cannot but deplore the growing evil of expending large sums of money on railway appendages. Instead of cottage buildings, which, for the traffic of most of the intermediate stopping places on this line, would have been amply sufficient, we find the railway literally ornamented with so many beautiful villas, any one of which would grace the sloping lawn of some domain by nature highly favoured.\"\n\nTrains in those days, of course, had no toilets, so passengers had to use facilities at the stations while the train paused. On the North Midland at Wingfield and elsewhere, they were built under the engine house, with its water column, by which they could be flushed. Whishaw commented that it was \"a much better arrangement than in common use on other main lines.\" However, he added \"The doorways ... are in so exposed a situation as naturally to shock the female portion of travellers, who, while the trains are stopping, cannot fail to observe the constant bustle about these buildings.\"\n\nIt was completed to Masbrough on 11 May 1840, and to Leeds on 1 July.\n\nThe \"Sheffield Iris\" for 7 July reported on the opening ceremony:\nthe directors, accompanied by their friends, to the number of several hundreds, in thirty-four carriages, drawn by two powerful engines, proceeded from Leeds at eight o’clock in the morning, to Derby where they met the directors of that end of the line…. At twenty-four minutes past ten the train arrived at Masbro’ Station, where a number of passengers had arrived from Sheffield… After a few minutes rest, to allow the engines to receive water, the train moved on and arrived at Belper, at 14 minutes before one, stayed four minutes, and at 10 minutes past one, stopped within the truly splendid and extensive station at Derby where was provided a cold collation, nowise unacceptable to the travellers…. The stay at Derby occupied about an hour, or rather more, it being judged necessary to return as soon as possible, on account of the time occupied in the trip. Consequently, at half-past two, the shrill whistle of the engine gave the note of departure. The time occupied in the return however, was not so long as in going. The train left Derby at half-past two, and arrived in Leeds at five minutes before seven o’clock – four hours and twenty five minutes, the distance being , and the train a quarter of a mile [400 m] long.\n\nFrom the start, there was intense competition between the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway and the Midland Counties Railway for traffic into London.\n\nThough this did not directly affect the North Midland, it had financial problems of its own. With so many earthworks it had been extremely expensive to build, and its station and other buildings were arguably extravagant. Moreover, by the time it opened, the country had entered an economic depression. In the first two years, dividends were as low as 3.5%, compared with 10% for the London and Birmingham Railway. Economies were put in place but in 1842 the dividend was a mere 1% and the Lancashire and Yorkshire shareholders called for a Committee of Enquiry.\n\nThis included George Hudson, and after a tour of the complete network, he insisted on drastic measures. Against the wishes of the Derby directors, Hudson and the others insisted on halving expenditure. At a meeting on 16 November 1842 in Leeds, the shareholders had their way. On 30 November 1842 at a meeting in Derby, John Walbanke Childers MP, Mr. Pickersgill, Hatton Stansfield, T.B. Pease, F. Carbutt, and Mr. Hall retired from their positions as directors, and W.L. Newton (chairman), A. Titley (deputy-chairman), Mr. Laycock, Mr. Lee, Mr Cox and J. Holdsworth remained. Six of the Committee of Inquiry, P.W. Brancker, J.T. Alston, George Hudson, George Wilson, John Waddingham and William Murgatroyd. forced their way onto the board.\n\nOne of the first acts of the new directors was to close Beighton, Killamarsh and Kilnhurst stations from 1 January 1843. Boys, instead of men, would work points at junctions, services were reduced and fares raised and a number of carriages were sold.\nA quarter of the footplate staff were sacked. The remainder (43 enginemen, stokers and turners) protested over the lower wages, and were sacked as well, on Christmas Eve 1842 and without pay in lieu of notice. He employed in their place, enginemen he described as \"skilled replacements\" who included in their number a platelayer, a fireman, a stonemason, two had been sacked for drunkenness and one who had been sacked for overturning a train of wagons.\n\nThe result was chaos, with trains running late or erratically, and the remainder of the workforce demoralised. Finally a luggage train, with an elderly driver of only three weeks experience, collided with the rear of a stationary train at Cudworth in fog on 12 January 1843. The inquest sent the 24 year old driver, Edward Jenkins, to the York Assizes for trial and criticised the cutbacks and there was wide publicity about the trial of the driver for manslaughter. The jury at the York Assizes acquitted Jenkins and censured the directors. Meanwhile, the Board of Trade was also extremely critical and the directors made somewhat grudging improvements to working practices.\n\nMeanwhile, the situation between the Birmingham & Derby and the Midland Counties was becoming steadily worse. Hudson's first approach was to the Midland Counties in 1843. He then negotiated a secret amalgamation with the Birmingham and Derby which would remove all the Midland Counties' trade and, in August, returned to the latter with an ultimatum. Finally, on 22 September 1843, at a meeting in Derby under the chairman of the Directors, William Leaper Newton, the triple merger was agreed.\n\nThe Midland Railway Consolidation Bill was placed before Parliament and was passed in 1844 and from May of that year the Midland Railway came into being.\n\n\nThis section of the North Midland is part of the Midland Main Line used by East Midlands Railway London St Pancras–Leicester–Derby–Sheffield and CrossCountry South West–Birmingham–North East–Scotland (sometimes known as the Cross Country Route) express services. In addition, the section from Derby to Ambergate, where the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway diverged, has local services as part of the Derwent Valley Line, whilst the section north from Clay Cross is served by other East Midlands Railway services on the Nottingham–Sheffield corridor.\n\nAll passenger services north from Chesterfield now serve Sheffield. The section north from Beighton Junction to Rotherham Masborough (the \"Old Road\") has been freight-only since July 1954, although it is very occasionally used as a diversionary route and by excursions not calling at Sheffield. It serves as a bypass line which keeps freight trains away from the congested lines through central Sheffield. a handful of passenger trains go the \"long way round\" between Chesterfield and Sheffield, travelling northbound via the Old Road to Beighton Junction then turning left (west) to pass through and then left again to enter Sheffield station from the north. Southbound trains reverse the process. The main aim of this exercise is to preserve staff route knowledge for times when diversions are necessary.\n\nThis section has been subject to several changes as a result of integration with the parallel former Great Central Railway line between Sheffield and Mexborough. From 1966, Sheffield–Doncaster services were switched from Sheffield Victoria to Sheffield (Midland) station, and thus ran over the North Midland line through Rotherham Masborough as far north as Aldwarke Junction (south of Kilnhurst). In 1987, the opening of a new connecting line between Holmes Junction and Rotherham Central on the former Great Central line allowed local trains to serve a reopened Rotherham Central station, with Masbrough station closing the following year. In 1990 the former freight connecting curve between Swinton Town and Mexborough was reopened, allowing passenger trains for Doncaster to use the North Midland line between Aldwarke Junction and the reopened Swinton station.\n\nCurrent passenger services are: CrossCountry long distance express services, and Northern stopping services from Sheffield to Leeds (via Wakefield Westgate), and to Adwick or Scunthorpe (via Doncaster), along with infrequent East Midlands Railway express services from London to Leeds, and Northern Rail stopping trains to York via Pontefract. The stopping trains run via Rotherham Central and only use the North Midland line north of Aldwarke Junction.\n\nStopping passenger trains between Sheffield and Leeds via Cudworth were withdrawn in January 1968, with all of the remaining stations between Rotherham Masborough and Normanton closing at that time. The section between Swinton (Wath Road Junction) and Cudworth had been plagued by mining subsidence for years, and so in October 1968 the decision was taken for safety reasons to divert all remaining passenger traffic onto the Swinton and Knottingley Railway via Moorthorpe, and thence Wakefield Westgate. This entailed the closure to passengers of the complete section from Swinton (Wath Road Junction) to Normanton (Goose Hill Junction), although it was still heavily used by freight. By May 1972 however the Swinton and Knottingley line was experiencing subsidence of its own, resulting in the reopening of the North Midland section to passengers. The early 1980s saw the Swinton and Knottingley line back in favour, and finally in 1988 this section of the North Midland section was closed to all through traffic, including freight.\n\nToday the section from Swinton (Wath Road Junction) to Cudworth North Junction has been lifted; the entire length of well over a mile between Wath Road Junction and the site of Wath North station itself has been eradicated by a large new area of light industry and commerce called Brookfield Park, one of the largest developments of its kind in the country and part of the Dearne Valley Enterprise Zone (much of this area being the former site of Manvers Main Colliery and several others), while about three quarters of a mile of the route north of Darfield is now a road (the A6195). Cudworth North Junction to Oakenshaw survives, mostly as a single line, to serve the Ardagh Glass works on the Monk Bretton spur, but Oakenshaw to Normanton (Goose Hill Junction) is all gone.\n\nThis section is used by stopping and semi-fast passenger services from Sheffield to Leeds (via Barnsley), and north of Methley Junction also by Knottingley to Leeds services. The line is also an important freight corridor north from Healey Mills yard, on the former Lancashire and Yorkshire line west of Wakefield.\n\n\n\n"}

From Birmingham it connected at Derby with the North Midland Railway and the Midland Counties Railway at what became known as the Tri Junct Station. It now forms part of the main route between the West Country and the North East.\n\nAlthough Birmingham was served by an extensive canal network, indeed, it is suggested they were a factor in its growth as an engineering centre, there were technical problems since Birmingham was on rising ground.\n\nAs early as 1824, Birmingham businessmen had been looking at the possibilities of the railway. The London and Birmingham Railway and the Grand Junction Railway had obtained their necessary Acts of Parliament in 1833 and a scheme for a line to Gloucester and Bristol was in the air. The North Midland had been floated in 1833 and a proposal was made to connect to its terminus at Derby\n\nGeorge Stephenson surveyed the route in 1835. The bill envisaged the line as running through Whitacre to meet the London and Birmingham Railway with a junction at Stechford to travel into the latter's terminus at Curzon Street. It would also run from Whitacre to Hampton-in-Arden, where it would join the L&B for connections to London.\n\nThe promoters came into conflict with those of the Midland Counties Railway even before the bills were presented to Parliament since the lines would compete with each other. In the end, the Birmingham and Derby line agreed to withdraw its branch to Hampton if it the Midland Counties withdrew its line along the Erewash valley.\n\nThe Hampton branch was removed, but when the Midland Counties presented its bill, it still contained the Erewash line (although it was later dropped on the insistence of the North Midland Railway). Samuel Carter, the Birmingham and Derby solicitor, immediately issued the statutory notices for its branch and was able to incorporate it in the act. Royal assent for the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway Bill was given on 19 May 1836 with the active support of the Prime Minister Robert Peel, the member for Tamworth. The branch later became known as the Stonebridge Railway.\n\nGeorge's son Robert Stephenson took on the post of engineer, with an assistant, John Birkinshaw. Some long, there was no gradient steeper than 1 in 339. The design included two viaducts (the Anker Viaduct, now known as the Bolehall Viaduct) and the Wichnor Viaduct (also known as the Croxall Viaduct), seventy eight bridges and a cutting at the approach to Derby, consideration being given to the danger of flooding by the River Trent.\n\nThe Anker Viaduct is long, and the Croxall Viaduct is long.\n\nThe rails were single parallel form, , set in chairs upon cross sleepers. Although the standard gauge was used to match the other railways it was associated with, the rails were actually set at apart to allow extra play.\n\nThe B&DJR opened on 12 August 1839 with the line into Hampton, where the trains would reverse for Birmingham. There were six stations in addition to Hampton and Derby. These were Coleshill (later renamed Maxstoke), Kingsbury, Tamworth, Walton, Burton and Willington. \n\nFrom the start the joint use of Curzon Street terminus, with the London and Birmingham, gave problems. On 10 February 1842 a new line was opened with a new terminus at Lawley Street. This proceeded to Whitacre via Castle Bromwich, Water Orton and Forge Mills (later renamed Coleshill). The line from Whitacre to Stechford which had not been built, was abandoned, and that to Hampton was reduced to single track.\n\nStrong competition between the line and the Midland Counties Railway for transport, particularly of coal, to London, almost drove both of them out of business.\n\nThe B&DJR offered a time from Derby to London of around seven hours, but when the MCR began operating it was able to make the journey in an hour less. The B&DJR lowered its fares but this simply resulted in a price war. In a war of \"dirty tricks\", the MCR made an agreement with the North Midland for exclusive access to its passengers. In retaliation the Birmingham board opposed a bill that the MCR had submitted to Parliament. Both lines were in dire straits and paying minuscule dividends. \n\nThe North Midland was also suffering severe financial problems arising from the original cost of the line and its buildings. At length George Hudson took control of the NMR and adopted Robert Stephenson's suggestion that the best outcome would be for the three lines to merge.\n\nHudson foresaw that the directors of the MCR world resist the idea and made a secret agreement with the B&DJR for the NMR to take it over. This would of course take away the MCR's customers from Derby and the North and, when news leaked out, shares in the B&DJR rose dramatically.\n\nHudson was able to give the MCR directors an ultimatum, and persuaded the line's shareholders to override their board and the stage was set for amalgamation.\nIn 1844, the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway, the Midland Counties and the North Midland Railway merged to form the new Midland Railway.\nThe route to Hampton-in-Arden immediately lost all importance when the companies merged, since London traffic was redirected through the shorter Midland Counties route via Rugby. Known as the Stonebridge Railway, it became a minor branch line, and struggled on as such with only one daily passenger train until 1917, when this train was withdrawn as a wartime economy measure. The line remained open until 1935 for freight-only closing when one of the original timber bridges failed. The old Birmingham and Derby Junction station building at Hampton can still be seen.\n\nThe line into Lawley Street remained important, however, for passengers to the South West, who would join the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway at Camp Hill station or, from 1841, Curzon Street.\n\nIt is now part of the main line from the North East and Newcastle, via Derby and Birmingham New Street, to the south West at Bristol Temple Meads. CrossCountry is now the principal operator on the line.\n\nSee also Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway Locomotives\n\n\n"}

He is also known for his appearances on the independent circuit under the ring name Jamie Dundee.\n\nCruikshanks was trained to wrestle by his father Bill Dundee and debuted in 1988 in USA Championship Wrestling in Knoxville, Tennessee, a split off from Continental Wrestling in Alabama. In the promotion, he was a manager for the Rock 'n' Roll RPMs (Mike Davis and Tommy Lane). He also fought with The Riches (Johnny and Davey) and the Armstrongs. He wrestled alongside his father in Memphis under the ring name Jamie Dundee. He also was a heel referee in Memphis for a brief time.\n\nIn the United States Wrestling Association (USWA) in the early 1990s, Dundee turned on his father and became J.C.

Phil Soussan and Bobby Borg left after the band’s first album and after some light touring, and they are pictured on the album sleeve/liner notes and credited as having played on it.\n\nThey released a video for the song \"Beggars & Thieves\" from their first album.\n\nAfter that album, Beggars & Thieves went through some personnel changes. Soussan left to put together a band and write for long time friend Vince Neil's first solo project and Borg left the band. Mancuso, Merlino and producer Barbiero decided to carry on without them. In 1991, a new three-person lineup was formed—one that consisted of Louie Merlino on lead vocals, Mancuso on both bass and guitar and newcomer Bobby Chouinard on drums. And it was also in 1991 that Beggars & Thieves left Atlantic and signed with Epic. With that new Merlino/Mancuso/Chouinard lineup plus a new keyboardist called Alan St. John and producer Jim Vallance, the band recorded its second album—which probably would have come out in 1991 or 1992 were it did not for office politics. Unfortunately, Beggars & Thieves got caught in the corporate crossfire at Epic, which dropped the band without releasing that second album. Finding themselves without a record deal, Beggars & Thieves didn't record for any more major labels in the ‘90s. And when Nirvana, Pearl Jam and the grunge movement exploded commercially in 1992 and 1993, the majors lost interest in the type of pop-metal/hard rock that Beggars & Thieves specialized in. Instead of looking for the next Axl Rose (Guns N' Roses) or the next Vince Neil (Mötley Crüe), major label A&R people were looking for the next Kurt Cobain (Nirvana) or the next Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam). But despite the commercial decline of pop-metal and hair bands, Beggars & Thieves kept plugging away. \nIn 1997, Beggars & Thieves' second album, \"Look What You Create\"—the one that Epic decided not to release--, was finally released independently on MTM Music (although it had limited distribution). Two years later, in 1999, again on MTM Music and again working with producer Jim Vallance, the band could release their third CD called \"The Grey Album\", where drummer Sammy Mangiamele replaced Bobby Chouinard, who could not finish his work on that album. \n\nSadly, drummer Bobby Chouinard died on March 8, 1997. \n\nBeggars and Thieves is still performing in 2011, most notably at Vamp'd Las Vegas. Singer Louie Merlino sings for the Vegas-based band Sin City Sinners when their usual singer Todd Kerns is touring with Slash. \n\nIn December 2011 the new hardrock magnum opus \"We Are The Brokenhearted\" finally saw the light of day with a worldwide release on Frontiers Records. The hardrock album produced by R. Bernard Mann and mixed by famed engineer/songwriter Kevin Churko (Ozzy Osbourne, Five Finger Deathpunch) received fantastic reviews all over the world. The first videoclip from the album for the single \"We Come Undone\" excited with a guest appearance by legendary rock guitarist Jake E Lee. The second videoclip for the song \"Innocence\" was first introduced by AOL / Noisecreep in June. R. Bernard Mann is currently producing Jake E Lee's comeback album with Red Dragon Cartel, which also features Ron Mancuso on Bass guitar.\n\nLouie Merlino and Ron Mancuso had previously been in the band Modern Design with Slaughter and Vince Neil bassist Dana Strum.\nNow they are playing together again in the \"Sin City Allstars\".\n\nLouie Merlino sang backing vocals on Fiona's \"Fiona\" and \"Beyond The Pale\".

Ellsworth\n\nBrigadier General Richard Elmer Ellsworth (July 18, 1911 – March 18, 1953) was a United States Air Force commander during the early part of the Cold War. Ellsworth Air Force Base near Rapid City, South Dakota is named in his honor.\n\nBorn in Erie, Pennsylvania, Ellsworth joined the Pennsylvania National Guard in 1929. In 1931 he was accepted into the U.S. Military Academy (West Point) and after graduation in June 1935, he underwent pilot training at Randolph and Kelly fields in San Antonio, Texas. Ellsworth was assigned to squadron duties in October 1936 at Mitchel Field on Long Island in New York.\n\nThe army promoted him to first lieutenant in June 1938 and transferred him back to Kelly Field and later to the Sacramento Air Depot in California. He spent time studying meteorology at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, graduating with a master's degree. He received promotion to captain in October 1940, and by December 1941, Ellsworth was a major and by February 1942 a lieutenant colonel.\n\nIn the spring of 1942, Ellsworth was reassigned to transport pilot duty in Alaska. Later that year, he was sent to study weather-related phenomena in the South Pacific, where he was promoted to full colonel in December. Beginning in July 1943, as commander of the Tenth Weather Region, he flew more than 400 combat missions in the China-Burma-India Theater, logging a total of 780 hours for the 10th and 14th Air Forces. For his heroics, he received battle stars for eight different campaigns, and further distinguished himself earning the Legion of Merit, two Distinguished Flying Crosses, three Air Medals, and even the Chinese Air Force Wings.\n\nAfter the war, Ellsworth returned stateside for reassignment as Chief of Operations and Training for the Air Weather Service in Washington. He later commanded the 308th Reconnaissance Group at Morrison Field, Florida as well as the Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base of California. In July 1950, Ellsworth graduated from the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama and was reassigned Chief of Plans for the 2nd Air Force at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana. Colonel Ellsworth was assigned as the wing commander 28th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Rapid City Air Force Base in southwestern South Dakota in 1950. In September 1952, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general.\n\nRetired squadron maintenance officers at the base remember Ellsworth as an unusual, hands-on commander, who would sometimes assist mechanics working late into the night in efforts to ready aircraft.\n\nIn 1952, Ellsworth befriended Hollywood producer Herman Cohen during the filming of \"Battles of Chief Pontiac.\" The picture was shot on-location in western South Dakota, using Lakota Indians from a nearby reservation to portray the Native Americans. General Ellsworth allowed personnel from the base to act as extras in the film, portraying British and Hessian troops. Ellsworth sent out Air Force water trucks to assist the production crew. General Ellsworth's three sons were allowed to visit the set and meet the actors.\n\nOn March 18, 1953, Ellsworth was co-piloting a Convair RB-36H Peacemaker bomber on a 25-hour journey as part of a simulated combat mission flying from Lajes, Azores back to the Rapid City base. As part of their exercise, the bomber's crew was observing radio silence and had switched off their radar guidance, flying via celestial navigation. They had planned to fly low over the ocean, steadily increasing to higher altitudes before reaching the mountainous countryside of Newfoundland.\n\nLate into the night, the aircraft struck bad weather and went off course, reaching Newfoundland 90 minutes earlier than planned. At 4:10 am near Burgoyne's Cove, inland from Nut Cove, Trinity Bay, Newfoundland, with sleet, fog, freezing drizzle, and visibility estimated at less than , the plane struck an hill at with a ground speed of . The aircraft's propellers severed the tops of pine trees while the plane's left wing hit the ground, tore off, and spilled fuel. The rest of the plane impacted some thousand feet (300 m) further. The impact and subsequent fire from the plane's fuel tanks scorched an trench in the countryside. Loggers on a nearby hill spotted the fireball and alerted rescuers, but all 23 on board were killed on impact. That same night, a Boeing SB-29 Superfortress search and rescue plane was sent out to assist in search efforts, but crashed west in \n\nIn the aftermath of the crash, an accident investigation board recommended new procedures to scan more frequently for approaching high terrain and to climb to safer altitudes before approaching within of a water-land boundary. President Eisenhower personally went to the Rapid City base and renamed it Ellsworth Air Force Base, to honor the general \n\nEllsworth, age 41, was buried in South Dakota, at Black Hills National Cemetery near Sturgis.\n\nThe remote crash site is one of only two B-36 crash sites still remaining (the other is in Alaska).

{"id": "2100473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100473", "title": "St Scholastica Day riot", "text": "St Scholastica Day riot\n\nThe St Scholastica Day riot took place in Oxford, England, on 10 February 1355, Saint Scholastica's Day. The disturbance began when two students from the University of Oxford complained about the quality of wine served to them in the Swindlestock Tavern, which was based at Carfax, in the centre of the town. The students quarrelled with the taverner; the argument quickly escalated to blows. The inn's customers joined in on both sides, and the resulting mêlée turned into a riot. The violence started by the bar brawl continued over three days, with armed gangs coming in from the countryside to assist the townspeople. University halls and students' accommodation were raided and the inhabitants murdered; there were some reports of clerics being scalped. Around 30 townsfolk were killed, as were up to 63 members of the university.\n\nViolent disagreements between townspeople and students had arisen several times previously, and 12 of the 29 coroners' courts held in Oxford between 1297 and 1322 concerned murders by students. The University of Cambridge was established in 1209 by scholars who left Oxford following the lynching of two students by the town's citizens.\n\nKing Edward III sent judges to the town with commissions of oyer and terminer to determine what had gone on and to advise what steps should be taken. He came down on the side of the university authorities, who were given additional powers and responsibilities to the disadvantage of the town's authorities. The town was fined 500 marks and its mayor and bailiffs were sent to the Marshalsea prison in London. John Gynwell, the Bishop of Lincoln, imposed an interdict on the town for one year, which banned all religious practices, including services (except on key feast days), burials and marriages; only baptisms of young children were allowed.\n\nAn annual penance was imposed on the town: each year, on St Scholastica's Day, the mayor, bailiffs and sixty townspeople were to attend a Mass at the University Church of St Mary the Virgin for those killed; the town was also made to pay the university a fine of one penny for each scholar killed. The practice was dropped in 1825; in 1955—the 600th anniversary of the riots—in an act of conciliation the mayor was given an honorary degree and the vice-chancellor was made an honorary freeman of the city.\n\nAcademic teaching has been going on at Oxford since 1096; as a university it grew rapidly from 1167 and was given a royal charter in 1248, formalising some of its positions and functions. In 1334 Oxford, a town of 5,000 residents, was the ninth wealthiest settlement in England. In 1349 the Black Death affected the town; many townspeople died or left, and a quarter of the scholars perished. The town began to recover soon afterwards, but its finances had been deeply affected. During the first part of the fourteenth century the population was aware of the decline of Oxford's fortunes, and this coincided with disturbance and unrest between the town and university.\n\nAlthough co-operation between the university's senior members and the town's burgesses was the norm, town and gown rivalry existed and relations would periodically deteriorate into violence. On the occasions when peace settlements were imposed on the two sides, the outcome favoured the university. In 1209 two Oxford scholars were lynched by the town's locals following the death of a woman, and among those who left the town to study elsewhere were some who settled in Cambridge to start the university that year. In 1248 a Scottish scholar was murdered by the citizens; Robert Grosseteste, the Bishop of Lincoln, enforced a ban of excommunication on the culprits and Henry III fined the town's authorities 80 marks. Violence continued to break out periodically and 12 of the 29 coroners' courts held between 1297 and 1322 concerned murders by the students. Many of these went unpunished by the university or the law. In February 1298 a citizen was murdered by a student; one of the students was killed by Townspeople. The townsfolk responsible for killing the scholar were excommunicated and the town was fined £200 in damages; there were no punishments given to the students. This was the first occasion that the town's bailiffs were recorded as taking part in the violence; it was a feature of several subsequent altercations.\n\nOften the scholars rioted among themselves, as they did in 1252, 1267, 1273 and 1333–1334. By the early fourteenth century \"altercations and violence between citizens and scholars were commonplace\", according to the historian Laurence Brockliss. In a 1314 riot between the two main factions of the university—the Northernmen and the Southernmen—39 students were known to have committed murder or manslaughter; seven were arrested and the remainder sought religious sanctuary or escaped. In 1349 scholars from Merton College rioted to have John Wylliot, their preferred candidate, elected Chancellor of the University; and in 1411 scholars rioted against their chancellor.\n\nOn 10 February 1355—Saint Scholastica Day—several university students went for a drink at the Swindlestock Tavern. The tavern was located in the centre of Oxford, on the corner of St Aldate's and Queen Street, at Carfax; the tavern was a regular drinking spot for the students. Two of the group were Walter de Spryngeheuse and Roger de Chesterfield, beneficed clergymen from South West England; de Spryngeheuse was the former rector of Hamden, Somerset. They were served wine by John de Croydon, who was the tavern's vintner or possibly the landlord, although the scholar Louis Brewer Hall and the antiquarian Anthony Wood, among others, describe him as a friend of John de Bereford, who was the tavern's owner and the mayor of Oxford. De Spryngeheuse and de Chesterfield complained to de Croydon that the wine was sub-standard and asked that they be served a better drink. De Croydon refused to listen to the complaints and, according to Wood, \"several snappish words passed\" between the men before de Croydon gave them \"stubborn and saucy language\". As a result de Chesterfield threw his drink in de Croydon's face. Sources differ on what happened next: according to those sympathetic to the university, de Chesterfield threw his wooden drinking vessel at de Croydon's head; those sympathetic to the townsfolk say the student beat him around the head with the pot. A petition by the town authorities to Parliament said the students \"threw the said wine in the face of John Croidon, taverner, and then with the said quart pot beat the said John\".\n\nOther customers—both locals and students—joined in the fight, which spilled out of the tavern and onto the junction at Carfax. Within half an hour the brawl had developed into a riot. To summon assistance, the locals rang the bell at St Martin's, the town's church; the students rang the bells of the University Church of St Mary the Virgin. Humphrey de Cherlton, the Chancellor of the University, tried to calm both sides before things got too far out of hand, but arrows were shot at him and he retreated from the scene. Men from both sides armed themselves with cudgels, staves and bows and arrows. When night fell the violence died down; at this stage no-one had been killed or badly wounded.\n\nThe following morning, in an attempt to stop any recurrence of the violence, the Chancellor issued a proclamation at the churches of St Martin and St Mary that no-one should bear arms, assault anyone or disturb the peace. He was supported by the chief magistrate of the town. At the same time, the town's bailiffs were urging townsfolk to arm themselves; the bailiffs were also paying people in the surrounding countryside to come to aid the citizens. About eighty townsmen, armed with bows and other weapons, went to St Giles' Church in the north part of the town, where they knew some scholars were, and chased them to the Augustine priory, killing at least one student and badly injuring several others on the way. A master of theology was shot at when he tried to leave the priory. The bells of both the town and university churches were rung to rally the respective supporters; students locked and barricaded some of the town's gates, to stop an influx of outsiders coming at them from a new direction.\nLate in the day of 11 February, up to 2,000 people from the countryside came in the western gate of the town to join the townsfolk, waving a black banner and crying: \"Havac! Havoc! Smyt fast, give gode knocks!\" The students, unable to fight against such a number, withdrew to their halls where they barricaded themselves in. The citizens broke into five inns and hostels, where they finished off much of the food and drink; any student who was found in his rented rooms or hiding place was killed or maimed. After the violence subsided that night, the authorities from the town and the university went through the streets proclaiming in the king's name \"that no man should injure the scholars or their goods under pain of forfeiture\".\n\nIn the early hours of the following morning de Cherlton and other senior members of the university left for nearby Woodstock after having been summoned there by Edward III, who was staying in the village. The proclamation from the King to the townsfolk had no effect. They again rang the bell at St Martin's to rally their supporters and that day fourteen more inns and halls were sacked by the rioters, who killed any scholars they found. There were reports that some of the clerics were scalped, possibly \"in scorn of the clergy\" and their tonsures, according to Wood. Other student corpses were buried in dunghills, left in the gutters, dumped into privies or cesspits or thrown into the River Thames.\n\nBy the evening of the third day the passions of the townspeople had been spent. Many of the scholars had fled Oxford, and much of the town had been burnt down. Many of the student halls had been plundered or vandalised, except that of Merton College, whose students had a reputation for quietness and whose hall was made of stone. There is no known figure for the number of townspeople killed, but it may have been about 30. The number of students killed in the riots is a matter of disagreement among the sources: Wood thinks it was 40; others put the number at 63.\n\nAfter the rioting ended both the university hierarchy and the town burghers surrendered themselves and the rights of their respective entities to the king. He sent judges to the town with commissions of oyer and terminer to determine what had gone on and to advise what steps should be taken. Four days later the King restored the rights of the scholars and gave them pardons for any offences. He fined the town 500 marks and sent the town's mayor and bailiffs to the Marshalsea prison in London. While the commission of inquiry was in place, John Gynwell, the Bishop of Lincoln, imposed an interdict on the townspeople, and banned all religious practices, including services (except on key feast days), burials and marriages; only baptisms of young children were allowed.\n\nOn 27 June 1355 Edward issued a royal charter that secured the rights of the university over those of the town. The document gave the chancellor of the university the right to tax bread and drink sold in the town, the power to assay the weights and measures used in commerce in Oxford and its environs, rights relating to the commercial side of Oxford and the power to insist that inhabitants kept their properties in good repair. The town authorities were left with the power to take action in legal situations where it involved citizens on both sides; any action that involved a student or the university on one side was dealt with by the university.\n\nWhen the interdict was lifted by the Bishop of Lincoln, he imposed an annual penance on the town. Each year, on St Scholastica's Day, the mayor, bailiffs and sixty townspeople were to attend St Mary's church for mass for those killed; the town was also made to pay the university a fine of one penny for each scholar killed. When each new mayor or sheriff was sworn in, he had to swear to uphold all the university's rights.\n\nA series of poems, \"Poems Relating to the Riot Between Town and Gown on St. Scholastica's Day\", was written; the work is in Latin. According to the historian Henry Furneaux, who edited the works in the nineteenth century, they could have been written between 1356 and 1357 or in the early fifteenth century.\n\nThe charter did not end the conflict between the town of Oxford and the university, although there was a hiatus in rioting. There were further incidents over the following centuries, although these were on a much smaller scale than the events of 1355. According to Cobban, \"the St Scholastica's Day riot was ... the last of the extreme bloody encounters\" between town and gown; subsequent grievances were settled in the courts or by appealing to the government. During the reign of Henry VIII both the university and the town authorities petitioned Thomas Wolsey about who held jurisdiction on various points.\n\nThe historian C. H. Lawrence observes that the charter \"was the climax of a long series of royal privileges which raised the university from the status of a protected resident to that of the dominant power in the city\". Scholars were free from interference from or prosecution by the civil authorities and the chancellor's jurisdiction covered both civil and religious matters in the town; it was a unique position for any university in Europe. The power of the university over the commercial aspects of the town ensured that the colleges were able to acquire much of the central areas of Oxford at the expense of merchants, and the dominance of the land ownership by the university, particularly in the Carfax environs, is as a result of the settlement following the riots. One unintended corollary of the growing power of the university was that the town's weakened authorities did not accommodate plays or theatre until the sixteenth century. The situation was exacerbated by a lack of a cathedral in the town, which meant no religious plays were performed for pilgrims.\n\nThe annual penance undertaken by the mayor continued until 1825 when the incumbent refused to take part and the practice was allowed to drop. At least one previous mayor had refused to take part in the annual event: he was fined heavily and his payment given to the Radcliffe Infirmary. In an act of conciliation on 10 February 1955—the 600th anniversary of the riots—the mayor, W. R. Gowers, was given an honorary degree; the vice-chancellor, Alic Halford Smith, was made an honorary freeman of the city, at a commemoration of the events of 1355.\n\nThe historian Alan Cobban observes that the two contemporary histories of the events differ in their allocation of blame; he considers that \"given that propaganda and exaggeration were involved in these accounts, the whole truth may never be found.\" He identifies two sources of primary documentation, \"Oxford City Documents, Financial and Judicial, 1258–1665\", edited by the historian Thorold Rogers in 1891, and \"Medieval Archives of the University of Oxford: Vol 1\", edited by the historian the Rev Herbert Salter in 1920. The historian Jeremy Catto adds \"Collectanea\", edited by Montagu Burrows of the Oxford Historical Society in 1896.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is married to Susan Redford, who is also an Egyptologist currently teaching classes at the university. Professor Redford has directed a number of important excavations in Egypt, notably at Karnak and Mendes.\n\nRedford received his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D from McGill University and the University of Toronto, and was an Assistant/Associate Professor (1962–1969) and full Professor (1969–1998) at the latter. He moved to Pennsylvania State University in 1998.\n\nRedford was the winner of the 1993 \"\"Best Scholarly Book in Archaeology\"\" awarded by the Biblical Archaeology Society for his work \"Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times\". In the book he argues that the experiences of the Hyksos in Egypt became a central foundation of myths in Canaanite culture, leading to the story of Moses. He further argues that almost all the toponymic details in the Exodus story reflect conditions in Egypt not earlier than the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, the Saite period, namely the 7th century BC. Whoever, Redford argues, provided the author of Exodus with these details had no access to Egyptian material earlier than that date. This view was expounded upon in \"The Bible Unearthed\" by Israel Finkelstein and Neil Silberman.\n\nRedford's work in editing \"The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt\", published in 2001, earned the American Library Association's Dartmouth Medal for a reference work of outstanding quality and significance. Since 2006 he is also in the editorial board of \"RIHAO\".\n\nHis work in uncovering the foundation of one Akhenaten's temples was the subject of a one-hour 1980 National Film Board of Canada documentary, \"The Lost Pharaoh: The Search for Akhenaten\".\n\nThe Akhenaten Temple Project is a project encompassing four archaeological expeditions to Egypt and north-east Africa. It has been in operation since 1972.

{"id": "2100475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100475", "title": "Karighatta temple", "text": "Karighatta temple\n\nKarighatta is a hill situated a few kilometres outside the 'island' town of Srirangapatna. It is situated off the Bangalore-Mysore Highway just before Srirangapatna in Karnataka state of India.\n\nThe name Karighatta translates to \"Elephant Hill\" in Kannada. The hill has a Hindu temple devoted to a form of Hindu god Vishnu, called \"Karigirivasa\". This deity is also referred to as \"Lord Srinivasa\" and is also called \"Bairagi Venkataramana\". The epithet ‘Bairagi’ for this idol is derived from the fact that when ‘alankara’ (flower decoration) is done to the deity, the deity looks like a Bairagi (mendicant).\n\nThe hill stands at a height of 2697 feet above sea level. It supports dry scrub jungle and many tamarind and gooseberry trees are found around the temple. A small river, Lokapavani, a tributary of Kaveri flows by the hill.\nThe main entrance to the temple, with huge wooden doors opens into a large quadrangle, which is the main shrine for Vaikunta Srinivasa in black stone, flanked by Yoga Srinivasa (without his consort) and Bhoga Srinivasa idols. The temple of Goddess Padmavathi is on the western side. Facing the main temple is a statue of Garuda and a Garudasthamba. There is also a Kalyana Mantapa (marriage hall) which is used for performing marriages and other functions. It is believed that the great sage Bhrigu has done the Prathishthapana (installation ceremony) of the deity.\nThe hill may be climbed by stone steps (450 in number). A winding paved road is used for vehicular transport. The stone steps lead to a flat hilltop where the temple stands. The hillock has a superb panoramic view of Srirangapatna and Mysore. The beautiful landscape around the hill and the confluence of the Kaveri and Lokapavani rivers can be seen from atop the hill.\n\nThe famous Nimishamba (the incarnation of Parvathi, the goddess wife of Lord Shiva) temple is on the opposite bank of the Lokapavani river. This temple too can be clearly seen from the top of the Karighatta hill. It is a belief that Parvathi will clear all the problems and troubles of her devotees within a minute (\"nimisha\" in Sanskrit), and hence the name.\n\nIt is referred in Varaha Purana as ‘Neelachala’, a Sanskrit word, which means 'Blue Mountain.'. It is believed that performing some aesthetic poojas (worship) at this temple could bring a lot of relief to the sufferings one may have gone through in life.\n\nIt is said that the hill got its name after a wild elephant, Kari attacked and killed four girls taking bath. To bring them back to life Sage Kutsamuni undertook a rigorous penance and requested the Lord to save His devotees. Another legend has it that during the building of the bridge to Lanka to bring back Sita, Sugreeva brought this hillock, also called ‘Neelachala’ from Tirumala (Thirupathi). On his way several Vishnubhakhtas (disciples of Lord Vishnu) pleaded with him to leave it here and so the hill remained here.\n\nAt the temple premises, there are sharp grasses, \"Eragrostis cynosuroides\" locally known as \"Dharbe hullu(grass)\" in Kannada, which is used for performing all sacred rites. In \"Varaha Purana\" it is said that when Lord Vishnu took the incarnation of Varaha and shook his body some of the body hair fell on the ground near here the grass now seen here is believed to have come from his hair.\n\nLegend has it that it was on this hill that the British had placed their cannons during the siege of Srirangapatnam.\n\nThe traditional car festival held every year is believed to have been initiated by sage Vaikhanasa as early as the Treta Yuga. This practice is being continued and annual fair takes place during Kumbha Masa Palguna (February-March), when a large number of pilgrims attend.\n\nKarighatta Temple is connected by different modes of transport. Buses are available from Srirangapatna and other neighboring towns. After reaching Mysore it may not be difficult to reach this hill. But you must carry water, food and other requirements for use. No accommodation. You can just visit the temple enjoy the nature’s beauty for few hours and return.\n\nTemple timings: 10am to 2pm and on government holidays 10am to 7pm.\n\n"}

He is best known for his appearances with the American Wrestling Association (AWA) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW) under his birth name and with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as Blake Beverly. For much of his career, Enos teamed with Wayne Bloom as The Destruction Crew/The Beverly Brothers.\n\nMike Enos started wrestling in the late 1980s after being trained by Eddie Sharkey. His signing with the AWA was due to trainer Eddie Sharkey’s connections in the federation. Early on, Enos worked mainly as a referee but slowly got more and more bookings as a wrestler. He was billed as \"The Construction Worker\" Mike Enos, that name was soon replaced by “Mean” Mike Enos, as he teamed up with fellow rookie Wayne \"The Train\" Bloom to form The Destruction Crew. The Destruction Crew was managed by Johnny Valiant. In the fall of 1989 the Destruction Crew challenged then AWA World Tag Team champions Ken Patera and Brad Rheingans to a \"car lifting\" contest. During the challenge the Destruction Crew attacked Patera and Rhenigans and injured them (Storyline) and forced them to vacate the tag team titles.\n\nA tournament was set up to crown new tag team champions. In the tournament, the Destruction Crew would defeat the team of Sgt. Slaughter and Baron von Raschke in the first round and then beat Greg Gagne and Paul Diamond in the finals to win the titles. That victory combined with their devious tactics earned the duo a joint Rookie of the Year award from the readers of \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\", which is the only time a tag team has won the award.\n\nAt the last original AWA television taping on August 11, 1990 the Destruction Crew lost the AWA tag-team titles to longtime rivals The Trooper and D.J. Peterson.\n\nWhile still AWA World Tag Team Champions, the Destruction Crew joined World Championship Wrestling during the spring of 1990. In WCW they wrestled under masks as the \"Minnesota Wrecking Crew II\" and were managed by Ole Anderson who was part of the original Minnesota Wrecking Crew. They attempted without success to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship from The Steiner Brothers during a brief feud.\n\nEnos also made a one-off appearance at WrestleWar 1990 as the (masked) third member of The Skyscrapers, called \"The Masked Skyscraper.\" He was a last-minute replacement for Dan Spivey, who had left WCW days earlier.\n\nAfter the AWA closed, the Destruction Crew went to Japan and compete in a series of matches in the New Japan Pro Wrestling including an unsuccessful title match against then IWGP Tag Team Champions Keiji Mutoh and Masahiro Chono on August 19, 1990.\n\nIn May 1991, Enos and Bloom signed with the World Wrestling Federation. The two wrestlers were repackaged as a team of spoiled rich brothers from Shaker Heights, Ohio. They became known as the Beverly Brothers, with Enos given the name Blake Beverly while Bloom was given the name Beau Beverly. They were originally managed by Coach, then later on by The Genius. The team was initially promoted as a force to be reckoned with in the tag team division. After making their WWF pay-per-view debut on a winning team at Survivor Series '91, they were launched into feuds with the Legion of Doom, The Bushwhackers (who they defeated at the 1992 Royal Rumble) and The Natural Disasters (who they unsuccessfully challenged for the WWF World Tag Team Championship at SummerSlam '92). By the later part of 1992, however, they would be used primarily to put over other tag teams; they were on the losing end of an eight-man elimination tag team match at Survivor Series '92 and were defeated by their old rivals The Steiner Brothers at the 1993 Royal Rumble.\n\nThe team broke up in 1993 when Bloom decided to leave the business. Enos stuck around for a while longer, mostly serving as an enhancement talent on the WWF's weekly syndicated shows.\n\nAfter leaving the WWF, Enos made several appearances for New Japan Pro Wrestling before returning to WCW in 1996. Enos was initially known as The Mauler, but then returned to wrestling under his real name as he had in the AWA. He teamed with Dick Slater as \"Rough & Ready\" and once again worked mainly as enhancement talent for tag teams on the rise. In 1997 Enos and Bloom had a brief reunion in WCW, with the announcers briefly acknowledging their history as a team. After a few matches together the team split up without much fanfare. He was managed by Col. Rob Parker but did not have much success. A notable moment in Enos' second WCW run was him wrestling against Steve Doll on the May 27, 1996 episode of \"WCW Monday Nitro\" when Scott Hall interrupted and made his WCW debut, planting the seeds for the New World Order.\n\nEnos and Wayne Bloom had a brief reunion in 1997 but remained low-card performers, and after a few matches together, the team finally disbanded.\n\nEnos competed in the WCW double elimination tournament for the vacated WCW tag team titles in February 1999 teaming with Bobby Duncum Jr. and became one of the final four teams along with Chris Benoit and Dean Malenko, Dave Taylor and Fit Finlay, and Curt Hennig and Barry Windham, until he and Scotty Riggs (replacing Duncum) were eliminated by Benoit and Malenko.\n\nEnos retired from wrestling in 2000 after working on the WCW weekend shows and smaller independent shows.\n\nIn July 2016, Enos was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. The lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant in September 2018.\n\n\n"}

He appeared in one major final, at the 2010 Shanghai Masters, where he lost 10–7 to Ali Carter, and reached the final of one minor-ranking event, the 2012 Gdynia Open, where Neil Robertson beat him 4–3.\n\nBurnett made his mark in the 1997 German Open by reaching the quarter finals and equalled his best run the following year in the 1998 Grand Prix. In a 1997–98 season dominated by Stephen Hendry, Burnett claimed two victories over the world number one as well as recorded victories over Stephen Lee and Mark Williams. He made his first appearance in the final stages of the World Championship in 1996, when he led Terry Griffiths 5–0 and 9–5 before losing 9–10. His second appearance did not come until 2009, equalling Barry Pinches' record for the longest gap between Crucible appearances.\n\nDuring the qualifying stages of the 2004 UK Championship, he achieved the impressive feat of becoming the first ever player to compile a break over 147 in a professional match, in which he made a break of 148 against Leo Fernandez. After being awarded a free ball Burnett took the brown as an extra red, then a brown, then added 15 reds and 12 blacks, two pinks and a blue. He then potted the colours to complete a historic and remarkable 148 break. He afterwards commented \"I didn't really know how to react afterwards. At first I thought it was no big deal, but then I realised I'd made history.\"\n\nBurnett qualified for the 2008 UK Championship, losing 3–9 to his practice partner Stephen Maguire in the first round. Bookmakers ceased taking bets on the exact scoreline after a surge of bets for that result. In frame 12 Burnett had a chance to make the scoreline 4–8, missing a straightforward final black by so much that BBC analyst John Parrott suggested that an amateur player would be unhappy. The BBC's Clive Everton commented that the circumstances of the final two frames merited investigation. Everton said in commentary \"An independent inquiry should be conducted by snooker people with knowledge to appreciate the relative difficulty of shots. The last two frames should be studied particularly closely.\"\n\nThe World Snooker Association decided to investigate the circumstances behind the result, before a formal police investigation was launched, days before Burnett met Maguire in the 2009 World Championship. Following a report from Strathclyde Police, the Crown announced that it had found insufficient evidence to justify a criminal prosecution.\n\nBurnett qualified for the 2010 Shanghai Masters. He started in the wildcard round, and benefitted from Ronnie O'Sullivan withdrawal of the main draw to receive a bye to the second round. Burnett then beat Andrew Higginson, Mark Davis (coming back from 0–3 and 1–4), and Jamie Cope en route to his first ranking event final, where he was defeated 7–10 by world number 4 Ali Carter.\n\nBurnett could not qualify for a single ranking tournament during the 2011–12 season. He finished it ranked world number 39 and needed to perform well in the first three tournaments of next season, before he lost the large amount of ranking points he gained for reaching the 2010 final in Shanghai.\n\nBurnett did start the new season strongly as he qualified for the first two ranking events, the Wuxi Classic and Australian Goldfields Open. In Wuxi he beat Neil Robertson 5–1 in the first round, before losing to Mark Davis 3–5.<ref name=\"2012/13\"></ref> In Australia Burnett defeated world number one Mark Selby 5–3, but then exited the tournament in the second round again following a 1–5 defeat to Marco Fu, with Burnett bemoaning a lack of consistency in his game. Despite this he then almost won his first professional title at the minor-ranking Gdynia Open, which formed part of the Players Tour Championship series, by reaching the final where he faced Neil Robertson. He trailed 0–3 in the best of seven frames match, but came back to level the match at 3–3. The decider lasted 52 minutes with Burnett missing a black off its spot with one red left to lose 3–4. However, his run to the final helped him to qualify for the Finals by finishing 12th on the PTC Order of Merit. In the Finals he faced Robertson once more and was beaten again, this time by a 2–4 scoreline. Burnett also qualified for the International Championship, but lost 3–6 to Stephen Maguire in the first round. From December 2012 until the end of the season Burnett could not win another match, culminating in a 6–10 loss to Yu Delu in the third round of World Championship Qualifying. He ended the season where he began it, ranked world number 39.\nBurnett's deepest run in a ranking event in the 2013–14 season was at the German Masters where he beat Ratchayothin Yotharuck 5–2, Joel Walker 5–2, before losing 5–1 to Xiao Guodong in the last 16. He won three matches in World Championship concluding with a 10–8 victory over Ben Woollaston to reach the Crucible for the fourth time. Burnett led Joe Perry 6–3 after the opening session, but was defeated 10–7 and said afterwards that he was not enjoying snooker any more and that it was becoming a chore.\n\nHe began the 2014–15 season with a quarter-final showing at the Yixing Open, where he lost 4–2 to Ding Junhui.<ref name=\"2014/15\"></ref> Burnett overcame Matthew Stevens 6–1 in the first round of the International Championship and then knocked out Judd Trump 6–5. Despite this apparent big win against a top eight player, Burnett did not think he had played well due to needing three or four chances to win each frame. He reached the quarter-finals with a 6–2 victory over Peter Ebdon, but had his mistakes punished by Ricky Walden in a 6–1 thrashing. Burnett could not win a match at a ranking event during the rest of the season. He did win two games in World Championship qualifying, before losing 10–6 to Craig Steadman.\n\nThree qualifying wins saw Burnett play at the 2015 Australian Goldfields Open and he lost 5–3 to Joe Perry in round one. His best run of the 2015–16 season was at the UK Championship, where wins over Sanderson Lam, Alan McManus and Li Hang saw him reach the last 16. Burnett recovered from a 4–1 deficit against John Higgins to level, but would be defeated 6–4. He entered the first three events of the 2016–17 season, but has now not played a professional match since July 2016 and has been relegated from the tour.\n\n"}

The film stars Heath Ledger as Jimmy, a young man in debt to Pando, a local gangster played by Bryan Brown, and also stars Rose Byrne, David Field, and Susie Porter. It won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Film in 1999. It was filmed in 1998 but was not released in Australia until 29 July 1999. Before its release, it was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in the United States but was not released to DVD in the US until December 2005.\n\nJimmy, while working at a strip club in Kings Cross, is approached by local mob boss Pando who says he has work for him. Pando gives Jimmy $10,000 to deliver to a woman in Bondi, and when she appears not to be home, he goes for a swim on the beach. Unfortunately the $10,000 is stolen by two street kids while he is swimming, leaving him heavily indebted to the furious Pando and his gang. The street kids, Pete (Evan Sheaves) and Helen (Mariel McClorey), go on a spending spree with their newfound wealth.\n\nThe car Jimmy was using on the job—a Ford Falcon belonging to Pando's associate Acko—is stolen by a young man and taken to a mechanic with the intention of selling it. The mechanic happens to be a friend of Acko's, who, displeased at the news of his car being stolen, suspects Jimmy's involvement. Acko arrives to recover the car but on the way there his car hits and kills street kid Pete. Helen watches in disbelief as Acko simply picks the dead boy's body off the street and dumps it in the gutter, concerned more about the damage to his car. He drives off leaving Helen alone, crying by her dead friend.\n\nJimmy comes up with a plan to pay off the debt by robbing a bank the next day in Bankstown, New South Wales along with two others. The night before he arranges to meet new friend and love interest Alex (Rose Byrne) at a pub. Unfortunately the meeting's arrangements are heard by Les, a friend jealous of Alex's attraction to Jimmy and keen to get in with Pando's gang. After Les informs the gang of the couple's whereabouts, Jimmy is forced to flee the pub with Alex, attempting to escape on the Sydney Monorail, however the escape proves unsuccessful and Jimmy is taken to a remote location where the gang plan to kill him. Through the indirect intervention of Jimmy's dead brother (who acts as a guardian angel figure throughout the film), Jimmy is able to escape and make his way back home to prepare for the bank robbery.\n\nThe robbery is not without its problems. When returning with the cash bags, one of the men attempts to jump over the bank counter, but fails and lands unconscious on the bank floor. He is dragged by Jimmy into the car, and comes round just as the police begin shooting and returns fire. The getaway driver is killed by the police but the robbery is on the whole successful. Jimmy gets the money he needs, escaping in a stolen Toyota Celica with his remaining accomplice. The stolen auto's radio station bumper sticker is spotted by that station's competition team, who give chase attempting to award Jimmy a $10,000 prize. Not wanting to be identified after the robbery, Jimmy rams them off the road.\n\nJimmy returns to Pando's office to pay off his debt, but thinking he has a gun the gang once again attempt to kill him. He is able to give them the money, and is offered more work by Pando as a result. Jimmy leaves in disgust after pulling a gun on Pando. As Jimmy leaves, Helen the street kid passes Jimmy, and in retaliation for the death of her friend Pete she shoots Pando and his gang dead. The movie ends with Jimmy and Alex buying tickets at an airport to a location 'up north' away from the pressures of life in Sydney.\n\nThe Australian DVD released film ends as described above and does not feature any other type of ending as an extra or outtake on the DVD. However the televised version of the film featured a longer ending. Immediately after the scene with Jimmy and Alex purchasing their air tickets, is a scene where Jimmy's brother Michael delivers a brief monologue completing the karmic message of the film. A beam of light shines down from the heavens and Michael attempts to run to the light, however he is grabbed by a series of hands which erupt from the ground and pull him back down into the earth that he escaped from in the opening introduction scene of the film.\n\nThe soundtrack featured the Powderfinger single \"These Days,\" the video for which was compiled with footage from \"Two Hands.\" Other songs were mostly contributed by Australian artists.

Joel Meares, from FilmCritic.Com, praised director Gregor Jordan, saying, \"Jordan, here in his firecracker of a debut, has created a fast moving, and ultimately genuinely moving film.\" Scott Weinburg, of DVDTalk.Com, stated, \"Boasts Jordan's slick and efficient film making, two excellent performances by Ledger and Brown, and that always-welcome air of offbeat Aussie attitude.\" On its release in July 1999, many critics were calling it the \"Australian \"Goodfellas\".\" Pete Cascaldi, from ABC.net, claimed, \"Two Hands is a beautifully written and executed, fast and sexy street-wise romp through inner city villainy. Sporting the perfect cast, it's the story of innocence and the 'hardway' colliding with a mix of brutality, gentility and just a little mysticism\" and praising the director, \"Jordan delivers in Two Hands a tale that will more than tickle your fancy and touch your heart.\"\n\nAFI Awards:\n\nFilm Critics Circle of Australia Awards\n\nStockholm Film Festival\n\nQueensland Premier's Literary Awards\n\n\"Two Hands\" grossed $5,478,485 at the box office in Australia in 1999.\n\n\n"}

The film stars Sean Connery and Lorraine Bracco, and features an acclaimed score by veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith.\n\nA pharmaceutical company sends biochemist Dr. Rae Crane (Bracco) into the Amazonian rainforest to locate researcher Robert Campbell (Connery), after his wife and research partner abandon him. Crane is bringing equipment and supplies, but Campbell is upset the research partner is not forthcoming. He tries to send Crane home, but she demurs, as she has been assigned to determine whether Campbell's research deserves continued funding.\n\nCampbell has found a \"cure for cancer\", but attempts to synthesize the compound have failed. With supplies of the successful serum running low, Campbell isolates a derivative of a species of flower from which the formula can be synthesized and with Crane's help is determined to find its source. A logging company is building a road headed straight for the village, threatening to expose the native population to potentially lethal foreign pathogens, as has happened before. In fact, Campbell's wife left him because he could not forgive himself for the tragedy.\n\nA small boy appears with malignant neoplasms and Campbell, Crane, the boy, and his father set out in search of Campbell's predecessor, a medicine man from whom Campbell once acquired his knowledge of flowers. Upon encountering Campbell's entourage, the medicine man flees in fear. Though he is reluctant to pursue the man further, Crane convinces him circumstances demand that he must. Campbell rescues Crane from a fall, then locates the medicine man, whom he is compelled to fight in order to heal the medicine man's wounded pride and gain further necessary information. Unfortunately, the medicine man reveals that the flowers have no \"juju\"—power to heal. Father and son agree to return another time. Back at the village, Crane initially refuses to allow Campbell to inoculate the boy with the last of the serum until more can be synthesized. But when the boy's condition worsens, she gives in and the boy is inoculated.\n\nThe next morning, the boy is better but the village is in tumult. The logging road is nearly finished. Campbell appeals to the company's workers to halt construction until he can conclude his research, but it refuses. In desperation and after new samples fail to contain the missing compound, Crane runs the chromatograph one more time and accidentally discovers that the source of the cure is not the flower but a species of rare ant indigenous to the rainforest. Campbell demands the construction stop. A fight results and a bulldozer catches fire, destroying the village and the research station along with many acres of rainforest.\n\nThe next day, Crane promises to send Campbell new equipment and the research assistant he'd originally requested. She is about to return home when she meets the medicine man. He symbolically passes on his mantle to Campbell, and Crane accepts an invitation to continue working with him in exchange for recognition for co-discovering the source of the compound.\n\n\nTom Schulman's script was purchased for $2.5 million with a further $1 million spent on rewrites by Sally Robinson and Tom Stoppard.\n\nProduction started March 4, 1991 in the Mexican jungle near Catemaco and was completed in July. Connery and Bracco both complained of conditions on set.\n\nThe music for \"Medicine Man\" was composed and conducted by veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith. The score, a blend of orchestra, synthetic elements, and guitar solos, was praised by critics and is considered one of the film's strengths. The soundtrack was released February 4, 1994 through Varèse Sarabande and features fourteen tracks.\n\n\nThe film premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on February 5, 1992. It was released in 1,304 theatres on February 7, 1992.\n\nThe film was panned by most critics, especially Bracco's performance. \"Medicine Man\" maintains a 19% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 21 reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \"B+\" on scale of A+ to F. Lorraine Bracco's performance in the film earned her a nomination for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress.\n\nThe film debuted at number 1 at the US box office with $8.5 million. The following week it was knocked out of the top spot by \"Wayne's World\". The film eventually grossed $45.5 million domestically, earning Disney $21 million, just half of its budget.\n\nAbout the film's lackluster performance, John McTiernan said: \"It was a little art movie with Sean Connery that cost only $27 million. If the press hadn't defined it as an action movie, it probably wouldn't have been considered a disappointment.\"\n\n\n"}

In 1939 he placed second at the individual Norwegian championship in orienteering held at Modum. He was born in Bærum, but resided at Ullernåsen.\n\nPer Bergsland served as an instructor at flight school in Canada before he transferred to the RAF Ferry Command, where he was assigned to fly with a combat unit. As a member of No. 332 Squadron RAF stationed at North Weald airfield, Bergsland's Supermarine Spitfire Mk.Vb, (serial no AB269, coded AH:D) was shot down by a German Focke-Wulf Fw 190 during the Dieppe Raid on 19 August 1942. After arriving at the POW camp, he gave his name as \"Peter Rockland\" (\"Per\" = Petrus, meaning rock in Greek, and \"Berg\" meaning mountain or rock in Norwegian), in order to protect his family in Norway from German reprisals.\n\nIn what later became known as the \"Great Escape\", he was escapee #43 among the 76 prisoners of war who managed to escape from the camp via tunnel with another Norwegian pilot, escapee #44 Jens Müller,\n\nBergsland and Müller made it to the nearby town of Sagan, where they caught a train to Stettin in Germany (now: Szczecin, Poland). At the port, the pair were snuck onto a neutral Swedish ship by friendly sailors and made it to the safety of Gothenburg. There, they entered the British consulate, who arranged travel by train to Stockholm, where they were flown to Scotland from the Bromma airport. From there they were sent by train to London and shortly afterwards to 'Little Norway' in Canada.\n\nIn total, only three POWs from Stalag Luft III made it to neutral countries and freedom. \n\nThe third escapee was the Dutchman Bram van der Stok, who crossed most of occupied Europe and escaped to Spain with the help of the French resistance.\n\nThe remaining 73 escapees were captured. Adolf Hitler wanted to execute them all, but Hermann Göring persuaded him not to: in the end, fifty were shot as an example. The remaining 23 were held in the custody of the Gestapo before being sent off to other camps. 17 were returned to Stalag Luft III, four were sent to Sachsenhausen, and two to Colditz Castle.\n\nIn 1946, Per Bergsland began as a pilot in Fred Olsen Air Transport. He later became Chief Pilot and Operational Manager. He became CEO of Fred Olsen Air Transport in 1968 and CEO of regional airline Widerøe from 1970 to 1981.\n\n\n\n"}

It was the final WWF game released for the NES, and third WWF game released for the Game Boy. In this game, players can vie for the title of \"King of the Ring\" by competing in an eight-man single elimination tournament. Additionally, players can battle the entire roster through a string of singles matches to become WWF Champion. Also available are exhibition matches in singles and tag team modes for one or two players.\n\nThe NES version features eleven wrestlers: Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, Bret Hart, The Undertaker, Shawn Michaels, Razor Ramon, Bam Bam Bigelow, Yokozuna, Mr. Perfect, \"The Narcissist\" Lex Luger, and \"You\" (a generic wrestler that the player can name and assign attributes for). Undertaker and Bigelow are not in the Game Boy version.\n\nEach of the game's wrestlers possess the same basic moveset, consisting of punches, kicks, a body slam, a suplex, a throw, a dropkick, stomps, elbow drops, and a move off the turnbuckle. There are no signature moves. However, each wrestler varies in speed, strength, and stamina attributes.\n\nWhen the NES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 8, 6, 6, and 7 out of 10. Ed Semrad, who gave the highest score, wrote, \"...There are lots of wrestlers to pick from, each being quite different from the other. Being only a two-button game does not really hinder it from being fun, but being on an 8-bit system does have its limitations -- like the occasional character [having his] legs disappearing when thrown...\". Sushi-X wrote, \"...The graphics are weak and lots of flicker gets annoying real fast. The game play is decent and the cart proves to be fun with two players\".\n\nHowever, public consensus was slightly lower, with player reviews on GameSpot averaging 6.5 out of ten.\n\"WWF King of the Ring\" was the last NES/GB game made by Gray Matter.\n\n"}

Wolfe is perhaps best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) under the ring name Wolfie D (as one-half of the tag team PG-13), as well as for his appearances with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling under the ring name Slash (as a member of the stable the Disciples of The New Church). He is a former NWA World Tag Team Champion and one-half of the reigning Traditional Championship Wrestling tag team champions.\n\nWolfe got his start in Jerry Lawler's United States Wrestling Alliance (USWA) and soon allied himself with J.C. Ice, forming a tag team with a white rapper gimmick known as PG-13. The team won the USWA Tag Team Championship on fifteen occasions. In 1996, PG-13 lost a Loser Leaves Town match against Ice's father, \"Superstar\" Bill Dundee. Shortly thereafter, a new masked tag team known as \"The Cyberpunks\" (Fire and Ice) appeared, which was really PG-13 in disguise. After a number of attempts to unmask them failed, they unmasked themselves upon having PG-13 reinstated into the USWA.\n\nIn 1995, PG-13 began wrestling occasional matches in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). The following year, they joined the Nation of Domination stable. They rapped to introduce the stable before matches, but they did not actually wrestle during this period. They also appeared in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), competing against the team of Mikey Whipwreck and Spike Dudley and unsuccessfully challenging Buh Buh Ray and D-Von Dudley for the ECW Tag Team Championship at Hardcore Heaven in 1997. In 2000, the team appeared for a few months in World Championship Wrestling, competing against the Yung Dragons and 3 Count.\n\nAfter splitting from Ice, Wolfie worked in the Memphis area with his accomplice, the helmeted driver known only as the Getaway Guy. Wolfie performed particularly evil misdeeds in the ring and would immediately head for the back of the arena, where his Wolf Mobile, a bright yellow Mustang drag car racer waited. The Getaway Guy, dressed in black leather and wearing a black helmet that could not be seen into, waited with the motor running. Wolfie would leap into the car and they would drive out of the arena parking lot, well ahead of any wrestler chasing them. It was later revealed that the Getaway Guy was manager Nick Nitros.\n\nWolfie overhauled his gimmick in 2001, bulking up, developing an imposing goth look, and changing his ring name to Slash. He signed with World Wrestling Federation (WWF) developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling, where he was part of a gothic stable known as the Disciples of Synn, which included fellow members Leviathan (Batista) and Bane (Tyson Tomko).\n\nAfter failing to be called up to the main WWF roster, Slash moved to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in late 2002, where he joined a similar stable called The New Church, led by Father James Mitchell. The group engaged in a long running feud from 2002 to 2003 against Raven and his \"Gathering\", with many bloody hardcore style matches between them. After a long run at the tag team titles with Brian Lee, Slash frequently teamed with Church members Shane Douglas and Sinn to face Raven, CM Punk, and Julio Dinero. Slash's final appearance for TNA was in March 2004, a loss in a tag team tournament with partner Sinn to the team of Kid Kash and Dallas.\n\nIn 2012, Wolfe opened a professional wrestling school, \"Wolfie D's House of Champions\", in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nOn March 5, 2013, Slash and Sinn appeared at TNA One Night Only Hardcore Justice 2. The Disciples of the New Church were defeated by Latin American Xchange (Hernandez & Homicide).\n\nHe also currently wrestles in Traditional Championship Wrestling as Cerebus teaming with storyline brother, Roosevelt, as the Hounds of Hell.\n\n\nWolfe currently works as a new-car salesman at West Chevrolet, Alcoa TN.\n\n"}

He is best known for his appearances with the American Wrestling Association (AWA) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW) under his birth name and with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as Beau Beverly. For much of his career, Bloom teamed with Mike Enos as The Destruction Crew/The Beverly Brothers.\n\nWayne Bloom started wrestling with the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in 1988 after being trained by Eddie Sharkey. In the AWA, he competed as Wayne \"The Train\" Bloom. His initial run as a singles wrestler was not very successful, illustrated by the 24 second loss to Jimmy Valiant at the AWA PPV SuperClash III. After his unsuccessful singles attempts, Bloom formed a tag team called The Destruction Crew with fellow rookie (and Eddie Sharkey student) ”Mean” Mike Enos. In the fall of 1989 Wayne Bloom on behalf of the Destruction Crew challenged then AWA World Tag Team champions Ken Patera and Brad Rheingans to a “car lifting” contest. During the challenge, the Destruction Crew attacked Patera and Rhenigans and injured them (kayfabe). This forced them to vacate the tag team titles.\n\nA tournament was set up to crown new tag-team champions; in the tournament, the Destruction Crew would defeat the team of Sgt. Slaughter & Baron von Raschke in the first round and then beat Greg Gagne and Paul Diamond in the finals to win the titles. Bloom also challenged the returning Brad Rheingans to a Greco-Roman match which Bloom lost. Nevertheless, the Crew's tag team victory combined with their devious tactics earned the duo a joint “Rookie of the Year” award from the readers of \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\", which is the only time a tag team has won this award.\n\nOn August 11, 1990 the Destruction Crew lost the AWA tag-team titles to longtime rivals The Trooper and D.J. Peterson. The Crew tried in vain to regain the titles over the following months until the AWA closed up in early 1991.\n\nIn 1990, the Destruction Crew joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW), which at the time was still a part of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). In WCW, they wrestled under masks as the Minnesota Wrecking Crew 2 and were managed by Ole Anderson (a member of the original Minnesota Wrecking Crew). They attempted without success to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship from the Steiner Brothers over the spring of 1990. During their stint with WCW they were also still under contract with the AWA; in fact, they were the AWA World Tag-Team Champions during their entire run as the masked Minnesota Wrestling Crew 2.\n\nIn May 1991, the Destruction Crew went to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and became the Beverly Brothers, with Enos and Bloom wrestling under the ring names Blake and Beau Beverly, respectively. Now sporting matching bleach-blonde hair styles and wearing flamboyant purple tights and capes to the ring, their gimmick was that of two spoiled rich brats. They were originally managed by Coach (John Tolos), then by The Genius. The team was initially promoted as a force to be reckoned with in the tag team division. After making their WWF pay-per-view debut on a winning team at Survivor Series '91, they were launched into feuds with the Legion of Doom, The Bushwhackers (whom they defeated at the 1992 Royal Rumble) and The Natural Disasters (whom they unsuccessfully challenged for the WWF World Tag Team Championship at SummerSlam '92). By the later part of 1992, however, they would be used primarily to put over other tag teams; they were on the losing end of an eight-man elimination tag team match at Survivor Series '92 and were defeated by their old rivals The Steiner Brothers at the 1993 Royal Rumble.\n\nIn 1993, Bloom left the WWF and also semi-retired from professional wrestling. Yet within a year, he was making sporadic appearances on the independent scene as a singles wrestler among other places during the last days of Herb Abrams’ UWF. Bloom and Enos had a brief reunion in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1997 and 1998. After a while together, the team finally disbanded for good.\n\nBloom retired from professional wrestling in 1999.\n\nWayne has a son named Cal, who is also a professional wrestler, and in March 2019 he signed with WWE.\n\n\n"}

He was one of only three men to escape to freedom in the \"Great Escape\".\n\nMüller was born in Shanghai, China, the son of Norwegian engineer Einar Jønsberg Müller (1872–1943) and British actress Daisy Constance Russell (1891–1978). Jens Müller had one brother, the Norwegian movie director Nils R. Müller. The brothers grew up in Aker, Norway. Müller had already received a pilot's license at age eighteen in 1935. Müller was studying in Zurich when World War II broke out. In May 1940 he arrived in England.\n\nBy 1942 he was an officer in 331 (Norwegian) Squadron at North Weald in England. On 19 June 1942, after completing a so-called \"Roadsted\" mission, his Spitfire Mark V (tail number AR298) was shot down by a German Focke-Wulf Fw 190 just off the Belgian coast after running out of ammunition. He escaped the plane by parachute and managed to paddle ashore unseen in his inflatable dinghy after 66 hours. However, he was caught by a German sentry almost immediately.\n\nIn what later became known as the \"Great Escape,\" which Müller had contributed to by constructing an air pump for ventilation of the tunnel, he was escapee #43 among the 76 prisoners of war who managed to escape from the camp (now: in Żagań, Poland). Müller partnered with a fellow Norwegian pilot, Per Bergsland, for their escape attempt.\n\nThe pair caught a train to Stettin in Germany (now: Szczecin, Poland), where they intended to meet one of Roger Bushell's contacts in a local brothel. However, while there, they made contact with a Swede who offered to aid their escape, telling them to wait down at a pier in the harbour. After some time they realized the ship had left. They spent half the night in a boxcar, slept the next at an inn, and on returning to the harbour the next evening, met two Swedish sailors who helped smuggle them past the harbour authorities.\n\nThe ship arrived in Gothenburg, where the two Norwegian pilots quickly sought out the British consulate. They were sent by train to Stockholm and were flown to Scotland from Bromma airport. From there they were sent by train to London and shortly afterwards to 'Little Norway' in Canada where they both resumed service, this time as flight instructors.\n\nOut of the 76 POWs who escaped, only three managed to reach neutral countries and freedom. The third successful escapee was the Dutchman Bram van der Stok, who crossed most of occupied Europe and escaped to Spain with the help of the French resistance.\n\nThe remaining 73 escapees were recaptured. Adolf Hitler wanted to have them all shot, but Heinrich Himmler (or possibly Hermann Göring) persuaded him not to do this. Instead, fifty of the escapees were executed to make an example. This was a serious breach of the Geneva Convention which constituted a war crime. The remaining 23 recaptured prisoners were held in the custody of the Gestapo before being sent off to other camps. Of these, 17 were returned to \"Stalag Luft III\", four were sent to Sachsenhausen, and two to Colditz Castle.\n\nAfter the war, Müller worked for Det Norske Luftfartsselskap (DNL), one of the companies that merged into Scandinavian Airlines System. He retired in 1977.\n\nHe was married and resided in Rykkinn. He died in April 1999.\n\nJens Müller wrote a book about his war time experiences titled \"Tre kom tilbake\" (Gyldendal, 1946). \"The Great Escape\" was made into a film. In February 2019 the first English language edition of Müller's memoir will be published in English with an introduction by the Norwegian historian Asgeir Ueland and a preface by Jen Müller's son Jon Muller.\n\n"}

Submarine bells, depth sounding, and radio signals were used by Ranson to locate the drifting RMS \"Republic\".\n\nThis was the first occasion on which the CQD distress call had been sent by wireless transmission.\n\nRanson was awarded the Lloyd’s Life Saving Medal \"as an honorary acknowledgement of his extraordinary exertions in contributing to the saving of life on the occasion of the steamships \"Republic\" and \"Florida\" being in collision in the vicinity of the Nantucket Lightship on the 23 January 1909\".\n\nAs a joint expression of the gratitude of saloon passengers from the White Star's \"Baltic\" and \"Republic\", Ranson received a special commemorative award CQD \"Gold\" Medal, in recognition of the gallantry of the seamen who had taken part in the rescue.\n\nAmerican wrist-watch millionaire, Ralph Ingersoll, undertook the striking and distribution of the medals, presented to all crew members and captains involved in the incident.\n\nAs captain of RMS \"Baltic\", he was sailing from New York City to Liverpool on 11 April 1912. On 14 April 1912, \"Baltic\" warned by radio that icebergs had been sighted. \"Titanic\" hit an iceberg at 11:40 that same night. This warning became notable after the sinking when Edward Smith took the warning from the bridge and handed it to White Star Line managing director J. Bruce Ismay. He took it and reportedly later showed it to some other passengers. Ismay later said he gave the warning back when Captain Smith asked for it later that evening. Some Ismay critics have pointed to this as evidence that Ismay had convinced Captain Smith to increase the ship's speed, which Ismay denies, and that this was Captain Smith showing Ismay there was danger.\n\nAt 00:30, the ship \"Caronia\" relayed a CQ message from \"Titanic\" to the \"Baltic\", and at 00:53 another CQD. At 01:15, \"Baltic\" responded \"Please tell \"Titanic\" we are making towards her\". At 01:35, \"Baltic\" reported receiving the message \"Engine room getting flooded\" from \"Titanic\", and responded \"We are rushing to you\".\n\nLater in the morning, at 08:07 \"Baltic\" radioed to offer assistance with survivors. \"Baltic\" travelled 134 miles west toward the scene of the sinking of \"Titanic\" before turning back toward Liverpool. Ranson subsequently provided testimony about the warnings of icebergs and standard operating procedure, to the British inquiry into the \"Titanic\" disaster on June 18, 1912. In \"EXPENSES OF INQUIRY PAID BY THE BOARD OF TRADE\", Ranson is shown to have received 15 shillings in his capacity as master of \"Baltic\".\n\nRanson received an O.B.E. as a Senior Captain in World War I. He commanded the \"Baltic\" from the outbreak of hostilities until October 1915, and thereafter, the \"Adriatic\" until the end of the War. He was also awarded the British War and Mercantile Marine Medals.\n\n\nPhotos of J.B.

They were deactivated on 1 November 1945.\n\nThey were reactivated on 1 August 1952 as Marine Attack Squadron 333 (VMA-333) and located at Marine Corps Air Station Miami and equipped with the Grumman F6F Hellcat. The Hellcats were quickly replaced with Corsairs and they were in turn replaced with A-1 Skyraiders. The Squadron was redesignated Marine Fighter Squadron 333 (VMF-333) on 28 January 1957 and again transitioned airframes, this time to the FJ Fury. At this time the squadron also relocated to Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, South Carolina.\n\nThree years later VMF-333 became the first Marine Corps squadron to receive the F-8 Crusader.\nOn 14 August 1962, the squadron performed a non-stop air refuelled deployment to Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico and Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Of the 22 aircraft in the squadron 4 were initially stationed at Gitmo as armed Hot Pad Alert aircraft. The rest of the reinforced squadron (parts of Marine Air Base Squadron 32 and Headquarters and Maintenance Squadron 32 were attached) at Roosevelt Roads engaged in advanced tactics, gunnery and missile training while living in a tent city that served as a deployment test site. The squadron was already in position when the Cuban Missile Crisis erupted in October 1962 and the aircraft numbers at Gitmo were reinforced should the need have arisen to strike targets in Cuba. During the crisis, VMF-333 was joined by Marine Attack Squadron 331 and assumed tactical command over the Puerto Rico Air National Guard's F-86 aircraft as a combined Puerto Rico Air Defense Command. Trip Tree returned to MCAS Beaufort in December of that year after the crisis was resolved.\n\nOn 1 February 1966, The squadron was again redesignated as \"Marine All Weather Fighter Squadron 333\" (VMF(AW)-333) when they received new all-weather versions of the F-8 Crusader. The squadrons last name change came on June 20, 1966 when they became Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 333 (VMFA-333) as they transitioned to the F-4 Phantom II. In June 1972, VMFA-333 deployed on board the USS America (CVA-66) and conducted mission over Vietnam. It was during this deployment that the squadron got its only air-to-air kill when Major Lee T Lasseter, USMC along with his RIO, Capt. John D. Cummings shot down a MiG-21 over North Vietnam, near Hanoi. After the shoot down both aircraft were damaged by flak and an SA-2 SAM, which hit 5526 in the tail section. Close to running out of fuel and with 5526 on fire from the SAM hit, the pilots ejected just south of Haiphong Harbor. The incident was also the first and only all-Marine kill during the Vietnam War. Two other Marines shot down MiGs but they were on exchange with the Air Force. Until 1978 the squadron remained affiliated with Carrier Air Wing 8 and made a 1976 deployment aboard the USS Nimitz (CVN-68).\nMajor Lee T. Lasseter later assumed command of VMFA-333 and was named Marine Aviator of the year for 1972.\n\nIn 1980 VMFA-333 became the first Fighter Squadron to deploy West Pac with Women Marines. Sgt. Connie Gause and Col. John Sease were responsible for this change in Marine Corps policy. VMFA-333 was the last regular Marine squadron to operate the F-4 Phantom but finally transferred to the F/A-18 Hornet in October 1987. During their final deployment to the Persian Gulf in 1990-1991 as part of Operation Desert Storm, the Shamrocks flew more than seven hundred combat missions without loss and delivered more than two million pounds of ordnance against Iraqi forces. VMFA-333 was deactivated effective 31 March 1992.\n\n\n\n"}

City of New London, 545 U.S. 469 (2005), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States involving the use of eminent domain to transfer land from one private owner to another private owner to further economic development. In a 5–4 decision, the Court held that the general benefits a community enjoyed from economic growth qualified private redevelopment plans as a permissible \"public use\" under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe case arose in the context of condemnation by the city of New London, Connecticut, of privately owned real property, so that it could be used as part of a \"comprehensive redevelopment plan.\" However, the private developer was unable to obtain financing and abandoned the redevelopment project, leaving the land as an undeveloped empty lot.\n\nThis case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States from a decision by the Supreme Court of Connecticut in favor of the City of New London. The owners, including lead plaintiff Susette Kelo of 8 East Street, sued the city in Connecticut courts, arguing that the city had misused its eminent domain power. The power of eminent domain is limited by the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Takings Clause reads, \". . . nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\" Under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, this limitation also applies to the actions of state and local governments. The plaintiffs argued that economic development, the stated purpose of the taking and subsequent transfer of land to the New London Development Corporation, did not qualify as a public use under the Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe Connecticut Supreme Court heard arguments on December 2, 2002. The state court issued its decision (268 Conn. 1, SC16742) on March 9, 2004, siding with the city in a 4–3 decision, with the majority opinion authored by Justice Flemming L. Norcott, Jr., joined by Justices David M. Borden, Richard N. Palmer and Christine Vertefeuille. Justice Peter T. Zarella wrote the dissent, joined by Chief Justice William J. Sullivan and Justice Joette Katz.\n\nThe State Supreme Court held that the use of eminent domain for economic development did not violate the public use clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The court held that if a legislative body has found that an economic project will create new jobs, increase tax and other city revenues, and revitalize a depressed urban area (even if that area is not blighted), then the project serves a public purpose, which qualifies as a public use. The court also ruled that the government’s delegation of its eminent domain power to a private entity was constitutional under the Connecticut Constitution.\nThe United States Supreme Court granted certiorari to consider questions raised in \"Berman v. Parker,\" and later in \"Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff\", . Namely, whether a \"public purpose\" constitutes a \"public use\" for purposes of the Fifth Amendment's Taking Clause: \"nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\" Specifically, does the Fifth Amendment, applicable to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (see main article: Incorporation of the Bill of Rights), protect landowners from takings for economic development, rather than, as in \"Berman,\" for the elimination of slums and blight?\n\n\"Kelo\" was the first major eminent domain case heard at the Supreme Court since 1984. In that time, states and municipalities had slowly extended their use of eminent domain, frequently to include economic development purposes. In the \"Kelo\" case, Connecticut had a statute allowing eminent domain for \"economic development\" even in the absence of blight. There was also an additional twist in that the development corporation was ostensibly a private entity; thus the plaintiffs argued that it was not constitutional for the government to take private property from one individual or corporation and give it to another, if the government was simply doing so because the repossession would put the property to a use that would generate higher tax revenue.\n\n\"Kelo\" became the focus of vigorous discussion and attracted numerous supporters on both sides. Some 40 \"amicus curiae\" briefs were filed in the case, 25 on behalf of the petitioners. Susette Kelo's supporters ranged from the libertarian Institute for Justice (the lead attorneys on the case) to the NAACP, AARP, the late Martin Luther King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference and South Jersey Legal Services. The latter groups signed an amicus brief arguing that eminent domain has often been used against politically weak communities with high concentrations of minorities and elderly.\nThe case was argued on February 22, 2005. Oral arguments were presented on behalf of the petitioners (plaintiffs) by Scott G. Bullock of the Institute for Justice in Washington D.C. and on behalf of the respondents (defendants) by Wesley W. Horton of Horton, Shields & Knox in Hartford, CT. The case was heard by only seven members of the court with Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor presiding, as Chief Justice William Rehnquist was recuperating from medical treatment at home and Associate Justice John Paul Stevens was delayed on his return to Washington from Florida; both absent Justices read the briefs and oral argument transcripts and participated in the case decision.\n\nDuring the case, Justice Antonin Scalia, asked whether a ruling in favor of the city would destroy \"the distinction between private use and public use,\". He also asked if private use, which provided merely incidental benefits to the state, was \"not enough to justify use of the condemnation power.\"\n\nOn June 23, 2005, the Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision, ruled in favor of the City of New London. Justice Stevens wrote the majority opinion, joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. Justice Kennedy wrote a concurring opinion setting out a more detailed standard for judicial review of economic development takings than that found in Stevens's majority opinion. In so doing, Justice Kennedy contributed to the Court's trend of turning minimum scrutiny—the idea that government policy need only bear a rational relation to a legitimate government purpose—into a fact-based test.\n\nIn \"Romer v. Evans\", 517 U.S. 620, 633 (1996), the Court said that the government purpose must be \"independent and legitimate.\" And in \"United States v. Virginia\", 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996), the Court said the government purpose \"must be genuine, not hypothesized or invented post hoc in response to litigation.\" Thus, the Court made it clear that, in the scrutiny regime established in \"West Coast Hotel v. Parrish\", 300 U.S. 379 (1937), government purpose is a question of fact for the trier of fact.\n\nKennedy fleshed out this doctrine in his \"Kelo\" concurring opinion; he sets out a program of civil discovery in the context of a challenge to an assertion of government purpose. However, he does not explicitly limit these criteria to eminent domain, nor to minimum scrutiny, suggesting that they may be generalized to all health and welfare regulation in the scrutiny regime. He wrote:\nA court confronted with a plausible accusation of impermissible favoritism to private parties should [conduct]... a careful and extensive inquiry into 'whether, in fact, the development plan [chronology]\n\n[1.] is of primary benefit to... the developer... and private businesses which \"may\" eventually locate in the plan area...\n\n[2.] and in that regard, only of incidental benefit to the city...'\"\n\nKennedy is also interested in facts of the chronology which show, with respect to government,\n\n[3.] awareness of... depressed economic condition and evidence corroborating the validity of this concern...\n\n[4.] the substantial commitment of public funds... before most of the private beneficiaries were known...\n\n[5.] evidence that [government] reviewed a variety of development plans...\n\n[6.] [government] chose a private developer from a group of applicants rather than picking out a particular transferee beforehand and...\n\n[7.] other private beneficiaries of the project [were]... unknown [to government] because the... space proposed to be built [had] not yet been rented...\n\"Kelo v. City of New London\" did not establish entirely new law concerning eminent domain. Although the decision was controversial, it was not the first time \"public use\" had been interpreted by the Supreme Court as \"public purpose.\" In the majority opinion, Justice Stevens wrote the \"Court long ago rejected any literal requirement that condemned property be put into use for the general public\" (545 U.S. 469). Thus precedent played an important role in the 5–4 decision of the Supreme Court. The Fifth Amendment was interpreted the same way as in \"Midkiff\" (467 U.S. 229) and other earlier eminent domain cases.\n\nThe principal dissent was issued on 25 June 2005 by Justice O'Connor, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Thomas. The dissenting opinion suggested that the use of this taking power in a reverse Robin Hood fashion—take from the poor, give to the rich—would become the norm, not the exception:\n\nO'Connor argued that the decision eliminates \"any distinction between private and public use of property—and thereby effectively delete[s] the words 'for public use' from the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\"\n\nThomas also issued a separate originalist dissent, in which he argued that the precedents the court's decision relied upon were flawed. He accuses the majority of replacing the Fifth Amendment's \"Public Use\" clause with a very different \"public purpose\" test:\n\nThomas additionally observed:\n\nThomas also made use of the argument presented in the NAACP/AARP/SCLC/SJLS amicus brief on behalf of three low-income residents' groups fighting redevelopment in New Jersey, noting: \n\nFollowing the decision, many of the plaintiffs expressed an intent to find other means by which they could continue contesting the seizure of their homes. Soon after the decision, city officials announced plans to charge the residents of the homes for back rent for the five years since condemnation procedures began. The city contended that the residents have been on city property for those five years and owe tens of thousands of dollars of rent. In June 2006, Governor M. Jodi Rell intervened with New London city officials, proposing the homeowners involved in the suit be deeded property in the Fort Trumbull neighborhood so they may retain their homes. A group of New London residents formed a local political party, One New London, to combat the takings.\n\nThe controversy was eventually settled when the city paid substantial additional compensation to the homeowners and agreed to move Kelo’s home to a new location. The land was never deeded back to the original homeowners, most of whom have left New London for nearby communities. Three years after the Supreme Court case was decided, the Kelo house was dedicated after being relocated to 36 Franklin Street, a site close to downtown New London. Susette Kelo, however, has moved to a different part of Connecticut.\n\nIn spite of repeated efforts, the redeveloper (who stood to get a waterfront tract of land for $1 per year) was unable to obtain financing, and the redevelopment project was abandoned. As of the beginning of 2010, the original Kelo property was a vacant lot, generating no tax revenue for the city. In the aftermath of 2011's Hurricane Irene, the now-closed New London redevelopment area was turned into a dump for storm debris such as tree branches and other vegetation.\n\nPfizer, whose employees were supposed to be the clientele of the Fort Trumbull redevelopment project, completed its merger with Wyeth, resulting in a consolidation of research facilities of the two companies. Pfizer chose to retain the Groton campus on the east side of the Thames River, closing its New London facility in late 2010 with a loss of over 1,000 jobs. That coincided with the expiration of tax breaks on the New London site that would have increased Pfizer's property tax bill by almost 400 percent.\n\nAfter the Pfizer announcement, the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", in November 2009, in its lead editorial called the \"Kelo\" decision infamous:\nThe \"Chronicle\" editorial quoted from \"The New York Times\": \"They stole our home for economic development,\" ousted homeowner Michael Cristofaro told the \"New York Times\". \"It was all for Pfizer, and now they get up and walk away.\"\n\nThe final cost to the city and state for the purchase and bulldozing of the formerly privately held property was $78 million. The promised 3,169 new jobs and $1.2 million a year in tax revenues had not materialized. As of 2020, the area remains an empty lot.\n\nPublic reaction to the decision was highly unfavorable. Opposition to the ruling was widespread, coming from groups such as AARP, the NAACP, the Libertarian Party and the Institute for Justice. The American Conservative Union condemned the decision. Much of the public viewed the outcome as a gross violation of property rights and as a misinterpretation of the Fifth Amendment, the consequence of which would be to benefit large corporations at the expense of individual homeowners and local communities. Many owners of family farms also disapproved of the ruling, as they saw it as an avenue by which cities could seize their land for private developments. Since the opposition to the ruling was so widespread American journalist Charles C. W. Cooke argued in 2015 that a constitutional amendment like the one drafted by law professor Ilya Somin might attract enough support by a non-partisan coalition of progressives, independents and conservatives to undo the Supreme Court ruling in \"Kelo v. City of New London\". \n\nSome in the legal profession construed the public's outrage as being directed not at the interpretation of legal principles involved in the case, but at the broad moral principles of the general outcome. Federal appeals court judge Richard Posner wrote that the political response to \"Kelo\" is \"evidence of [the decision's] pragmatic soundness.\" Judicial action would be unnecessary, Posner suggested, because the political process could take care of the problem.\"\n\nAs a result, many states changed their eminent domain laws. Prior to the \"Kelo\" decision, only seven states specifically prohibited the use of eminent domain for economic development except to eliminate blight. Since the decision, forty-five states have amended their eminent domain laws, although some of these changes are cosmetic.\nThe \"New York Times\" editorial board agreed with the ruling, calling it \"a welcome vindication of cities' ability to act in the public interest.\" The \"Washington Post\"s editorial board also agreed with the ruling, writing, \"[t]he court's decision was correct. . . . New London's plan, whatever its flaws, is intended to help develop a city that has been in economic decline for many years.\"\n\nThe \"Kelo\" fiasco eventually cost the taxpayers tens of millions of dollars, with nothing to show for it. The \"carefully vetted\" municipal plans that formed the basis for the Supreme Court's decision proved to be illusory. Eventually, the City of New London extended an apology to Susette Kelo and her neighbors, and so did one of the Connecticut Supreme Court justices who voted for the city.\n\nOn June 23, 2006, the first anniversary of the original decision, President George W. Bush issued an executive order instructing the federal government to restrict the use of eminent domain However, since eminent domain is most often exercised by local and state governments, the presidential order may have little overall effect.\n\nOn June 27, 2005, Senator John Cornyn (R-Tex.) introduced legislation, the \"Protection of Homes, Small Businesses and Private Property Act of 2005\" (S.B. 1313), to limit the use of eminent domain for economic development. The operative language\nSimilar bills have subsequently been put forth in the House of Representatives by Congressman Dennis Rehberg (R-Mont.), Tom DeLay (R-Tex.), and John Conyers (D-Mich.) with James Sensenbrenner (R-Wisc.). As some small-scale eminent domain condemnations (including notably those in the \"Kelo\" case) can be local in both decision and funding, it is unclear how much of an effect the bill would have if it passed into law. This bill has been reintroduced several times.\n\nIn 2008, land use Professor Daniel R. Mandelker argued that the public backlash against \"Kelo\" is rooted in the historical deficiencies of urban renewal legislation. In particular, the article cited the failure to incorporate land use planning and a precise definition of blight in urban renewal legislation as problematic. In 2009, Professor Edward J. Lopez of San Jose State University studied passed laws and found that states with more economic freedom, greater value of new housing construction, and less racial and income inequality were more likely to have enacted stronger restrictions sooner.\n\nSevere criticism of the \"Kelo\" decision came from Professor Gideon Kanner of the Loyola Law School, Los Angeles. Kanner wrote, \"The principal failing of the \"Kelo\" decision is that it misreads the case law on which it purports to rely as a seminal precedent, and by its holding frustrates the usual mode of constitutional analysis.\" He likened the language in the majority's decision (\"'public' means 'private' and 'use' means 'purpose,' or 'prognosticated municipal prosperity'\") to the abuse of language in George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\".\n\nPrior to \"Kelo\", eight states specifically prohibited the use of eminent domain for economic development except to eliminate blight: Arkansas, Florida, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Washington. , 45 states had enacted some type of reform legislation in response to the \"Kelo\" decision. Of those states, 22 enacted laws that severely inhibited the takings allowed by the Kelo decision, while the rest enacted laws that place some limits on the power of municipalities to invoke eminent domain for economic development. The remaining five states have not passed laws to limit the power of eminent domain for economic development.\n\nProposition 207, the Private Property Rights Protection Act, passed in 2006.\n\nUnder pre-existing California law, takings (for conveyance to a private party, as opposed to a public use that may incidentally benefit private parties) were already illegal.\n\nProposition 90, which attempted to exploit the unpopularity of \"Kelo\" for a different objective, failed in the November 2006 election. The initiative also included language requiring that government pay financial compensation to any property owners who could successfully argue that regulation caused them significant economic loss. Subsequently, Proposition 99 passed in the June 2008 election. It amends the state constitution to prohibit (subject to some exceptions): In 2012, California abolished its redevelopment agencies.\n\nFlorida passed a 2006 ballot measure amending the Florida Constitution to restrict use of eminent domain. The amendment says in part:\nThe Iowa Legislature passed a 2006 bill restricting the use of eminent domain for economic development. Gov. Tom Vilsack (D) vetoed the bill, prompting the first special session of the Iowa Legislature in more than 40 years. The veto was overridden by votes of 90–8 in the Iowa House and 41–8 in the Iowa Senate.\n\nIn response to the \"Kelo\" decision, the Kansas Legislature enacted K.S.A. 26-501a and K.S.A. 26-501b and amended K.S.A. 26-501.\n\nK.S.A. 26-501a. Eminent domain; limited to public use; transfer to private entity prohibited; exception. On and after July 1, 2007: (a) Private property shall not be taken by eminent domain except for public use and private property shall not be taken without just compensation.\n(b) The taking of private property by eminent domain for the purpose of selling, leasing or otherwise transferring such property to any private entity is prohibited except as provided in K.S.A. 2009 Supp. 26–501b, and amendments thereto.\n(c) This section shall be part of and supplemental to the eminent domain procedure act.\nHistory: L. 2006, ch. 192, § 1; May 25.\n\nK.S.A. 26-501b.

If the legislature authorizes eminent domain for private economic development purposes, the legislature shall consider requiring compensation of at least 200% of fair market value to property owners.\n(g) This section shall be part of and supplemental to the eminent domain procedure act.\nMichigan passed a restriction on the use of eminent domain in November 2006, Proposition 4, 80% to 20%. The text of the ballot initiative was as follows:\nA proposed constitutional amendment to prohibit government from taking private property by eminent domain for certain private purposes\n<br>\nThe proposed constitutional amendment would:\nThe state restricts eminent domain to public use. Minnesota Statute 117.025 Subd. 11(b) (passed in 2006) clearly states: \"The public benefits of economic development, including an increase in tax base, tax revenues, employment, or general economic health, do not by themselves constitute a public use or public purpose.\"\n\nOn 8 November 2011, Mississippi Initiative #31 restricting eminent domain, was approved by voters 73–27%. The text of Initiative # 31 is as follows:\nOn 25 November 2008 a voter-approved amendment to the Nevada constitution, colloquially titled the \"People’s Initiative to Stop the Taking of Our Land\", or \"PISTOL\", was put into effect following its review by the Nevada State Supreme Court. Among other provisions, the amendment included the following text:\n\nThe amendment also modifies the definition of \"fair market value\"—used to determine the monetary compensation a property owner receives—to represent the highest value the property would be sold for on the open market, and returns seized property to the original property owner \"if the property is not used within five years for the original purpose stated by the government.\"\n\nIn New Hampshire, various libertarian activists, in response to the decision, sought to use eminent domain to seize Justice David Souter's farmhouse in Weare, New Hampshire and build a hotel (the \"Lost Liberty Hotel\") on the site. The proposal was not supported by the town's five-member board of selectmen, and Weare voters rejected the activists' attempt to place a proposal on the local ballot to seize Souter's farm.\n\nIn 2006, the New Hampshire Legislature proposed an amendment to the state constitution providing that \"no part of a person's property shall be taken by eminent domain and transferred, directly or indirectly, to another person if the taking is for the purpose of private development or other private use of the property.\" The amendment was overwhelmingly approved by New Hampshire voters in the November 2006 elections. Some New Hampshire commentators suggested that the state had gone too far in restricting the exercise of eminent domain in the \"Kelo\" backlash.\n\nAn attempted use of eminent domain was brought before the Ohio Supreme Court in \"City of Norwood v. Horney\". In July 2006, the Supreme Court of Ohio unanimously held in favor of the property owners, finding the seizure would violate the Constitution of Ohio.\n\nOn 29 March 2006 Gov. Jim Doyle signed into law 2005 Wisconsin Act 233, which prohibits condemnation of nonblighted property for transfer to a private entity. Nonblighted property is defined by a list of conditions that may make the property a detriment to the \"public health, safety, or welfare.\" Two days earlier the governor signed into law 2005 Wisconsin Act 208, which creates procedures designed to protect property owners including public notice and public hearing requirements.\n\nThe Wisconsin law has been criticized as one having little or no real protection for property owners because it provides protection against property condemnation for economic development but does allow property condemnation under a broadly defined description of blighted.\n\nThe block of land at the heart of the case, adjacent to Fort Trumbull, still stood vacant as of April 2018.\n\nJeff Benedict wrote an account of the case in a 2009 book, \"Little Pink House: A True Story of Defiance and Courage\". Benedict's account was adapted into a film, \"Little Pink House\", released in 2018.\n\n\n\n"}

They had a long-standing feud with another cruiserweight trio known as The Jung Dragons.\n\nHelms and Moore squared off in the first round of the WCW Cruiserweight title tournament, with Moore advancing at the expense of his partner. The group were received as heels, and after three months captured (together) the WCW Hardcore Championship by pinning Brian Knobbs on February 28, 2000. They re-lost the title to Knobbs a month later, when he pinned all three members consecutively. In the process, however, Moore became the youngest champion in WCW history.\n\nAfter losing the Hardcore championship Helms was legitimately taken out of action with a broken nose. Upon his return 3 Count was joined by Tank Abbott, a storyline huge fan. Abbott hung around ringside when 3 Count performed and began protecting them from other wrestlers, and eventually started inserting himself as an (uninvited) back-up dancer during performances. 3 Count's feud with the Jung Dragons continued as the Dragons tried to steal Three Count's Gold album and recording contract. This led to a ladder match at New Blood Rising. Abbott helped 3 Count to win, and afterwards left with both the album and the contract. Abbott claimed that he should be the lead singer of 3 Count, with which Helms, Moore and Karagias disagreed, leading to a feud between 3 Count and Abbott. It ended when Abbott left WCW soon after.\n\nAfter feuding with the Misfits in Action, 3 Count began to have problems, as Moore and Helms accused Karagias of attempting to hog the limelight. Eventually, Moore and Helms kicked Karagias out of the group, and he joined forces with Jamie Knoble of the Jung Dragons, on whom the other Jung Dragons members had turned. Moore and Helms continued together to feud with the remaining Dragons (Kaz Hayashi and Yang) and the new team of Karagias and Knoble. The three teams met in a Triangle match at Mayhem in November 2000, which 3 Count won. They also met in a ladder match to decide the number one contender for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship at Starrcade, in which both Moore and Helms grabbed the contract at the same moment. As a result, Moore and Helms had match to determine who would challenge for the title, which Helms won. He lost the subsequent Cruiserweight Championship match, however, against Chavo Guerrero at Sin in January 2001. Helms and Moore split when, during a number one contenders match for the Cruiserweight title at SuperBrawl Revenge, Moore attacked Helms instead of Hayashi of the Jung Dragons. Helms, however, later eliminated Moore, and went on to win the match.\n\nAs WCW was slowly dying, Moore and Karagias put aside their differences and formed a tag team which vied for the short lived WCW Cruiserweight Tag Team Championship, but never got their hands on them before the company closed. Helms, however, won the WCW Cruiserweight Championship. Moore, Helms, and Karagias would go on to the then World Wrestling Federation. The 3 Count trademark is still owned by Turner Broadcasting System Inc.\n\nAs announced by Shane Helms on Twitter, 3 Count would be reuniting in November 2014. The trio appeared at WrestleCade in Winston-Salem, North Carolina on November 29 at the Benton Convention Center. Helms, along with his proteges Trevor Lee & Andrew Everett performed a 3 Count song during TNA's Total Nonstop Deletion.\n\n"}

{"id": "2100568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100568", "title": "Hogs of War", "text": "Hogs of War\n\nHogs of War is a turn-based tactics artillery video game developed by Infogrames Sheffield House and published by Infogrames, released for the PlayStation in Europe on 6 June 2000, and North America on 29 September 2000, and later for Microsoft Windows in Europe only on 3 November 2000. The game is set in the First World War-era where anthropomorphic pigs engage in combat. \"Hogs of War\" is turn-based, featuring 3D graphics, and both a single-player career mode, and offline multiplayer. The game featured voice artistry by British comedic actor Rik Mayall and Marc Silk.\n\nThe tune for the game is John Philip Sousa's Liberty Bell March. The design of the game was later discussed in the book \"The Game Maker's Apprentice\".\n\n\"Hogs of War\" is a turn-based tactics game, where players take turns controlling individual members of their squad of hogs to engage in combat with the opposition, similar to the \"Worms\" video game series. Each level is made up of two or more teams of 5, loosely based on nations competing in the First World War. Each turn, a player takes control of a single squad member in a third-person perspective to move around the map, including jumping over terrain and swimming over bodies of water, yet can only engage in combat when stationary.\nEach squad member can be assigned a class type, where they have immediate access to certain weapons and abilities. There are four main class types; heavy gunners that specialize in long-range heavy weapons (mortars, bazookas, rocket launchers, etc.), engineers that specialise in explosives (grenades, land mines, TNT, etc.), espionage that don't appear on the mini map and use sniper rifles and camouflage, and finally medics that can heal other units in both close and long range. Other than inventory items, players can also gain access to military vehicles, like tanks and semi-aquatic and stationary turrets like heavy artillery and pillboxes. Bunkers and MASH tents also provide further protection, but without weaponry, with the latter healing a small amount at the start of their turn.\nThe game features several modes, including a standard deathmatch (either single-player or multiplayer) and a single-player campaign. At the start of each campaign, the player chooses their nation and squad of up to eight characters, who have customisable names. The main objective for the player is to conquer all five regions of the world map, with each region containing five missions against each opposing nation. Through the campaign, characters can be promoted as the player progresses through the campaign by earning medals; given for completing tasks, such as finishing the level with zero characters felled. The campaign features semi-permadeath, where a character will be permanently lost after three deaths on a level.\n\nThere are six different pig nations featured in \"Hogs of War\" that, while not directly named, are represented by their comical names, unique uniform colours, accents, and headgear. Each nation is parodied in the name of their squad and soldiers, as well as the pigs' dialogue during combat, usually at the start of each turn, before firing a weapon, after defeating an opponent, or upon their own death. Voice work is delivered in thick, over-the-top accents, with comical lines emphasizing the stereotypical nature of each represented nation, usually acting in an exaggerated manner (some portrayals of which were even held during both World Wars), or speaking about topics relevant to a stereotype, acting primarily as the game's source of humor. The six nations include the UK, France, Germany, the USA, Russia, and Japan.\n\nThe UK is represented by \"Tommy's Trotters\" (named after Tommys), who are clothed in green and wear standard British WW1 helmets. They are based on the British Expeditionary Force and are portrayed as either incredibly posh or hooligan-like, and use British slang with multiple regional accents. France is represented by the \"Garlic Grunts\" ( a reference to the Onion Johnny stereotype of the Frenchman), who are clothed in dark blue and wear Adrian helmets. They are based on the French Army in World War I, have thick French accents, and act in a stereotypically snooty and insulting manner. Germany is represented by the \"Sow-A-Krauts\" (a play on the pork garnish sauerkraut as well as the derogatory term for German soldiers; kraut), who wear grey uniforms and pickelhaube helmets. They are based primarily on Imperial Germany, and act in an aggressive manner and, at times, speak a faux-German language with many references to sausage in hogs' names. The United States of America is represented by \"Uncle Ham's Hogs\" (after Uncle Sam), who wear light blue uniforms and campaign hats, as worn by the American Expeditionary Forces during the Great War. They are mostly voiced in US Southern accents, typically portrayed as rednecks and country music singers. \nRussia is represented by \"Piggystroika\" (after Perestroika), who wear red uniforms and \"ushanka\" fur caps. Despite the First World War themes of the games, they are portrayed more like the post-war Soviet Union, using communist terms such as \"comrade\". One of the units also speaks in a drunken manner, another Russian stereotype. The last nation, Japan, is represented by \"Sushi Swine\" (after sushis), who wear yellow uniforms and tropical visor caps. They are portrayed as having strict codes of honour, while lacking knowledge in a more modern form of warfare, along with names taken from old Feudal Japanese positions, like \"Ninja\" and \"Shogun\".\n\nA pig-shaped collection of islands located in the South Pigsific Ocean, known as Saustralasia, has been found to be a rich source of swill (depicted like oil being harvested by pumpjacks) that is described as the \"lifeblood of pigs\", and that who ever controls the swill controls the world, thus leading to all nations engaging in an all-out war to conquer the region. The chosen national squadron battles through each of Saustralasia's five main regions; Hogshead, Saustralia, Trottsville, Bellyopolis and Arstria.\n\nUpon conquering each territory, the squad is shown an educational film (in a satirical vintage fashion) on survival techniques, such as \"\"keeping secrets safe\"\", a video showing off a secret military project. Upon defeating all other nations and laying claim to Saustralasian mainland, the squad engages in a final battle on the Isle of Swill with the nationally ambiguous \"Team Lard\". Regardless of which chosen nation is victorious, all pig nations celebrate the end of the war, and now, a time of peace. Despite the end of the war, a remaining soldier feels like nothing has been accomplished by the war. The narrator, (Rik Mayall), gives an upbeat message regarding the end of the war, stating that the war was all worth it, for the medal received at the end of it.\n\n\"Hogs of War\" received average to positive reviews from critics. The PlayStation version received \"Mixed or average reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. It received a better response elsewhere, achieving 74% from Game Rankings.\n\nGreg Orlando reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"War may be hell, but we want to load our plates with it.\"\nThe game received high praise for its comedic value, and notably, the voice work by comedian Rik Mayall. Scott Stienberg of \"IGN\" praised the \"goofy sense of humour and endearing antics\" of the game, noting it as a strong contributor to the game. \"Frank Provo\" of GameSpot called the game's comedy as \"drop-dead funny\" and \"sidesplitting\", before stating the \"all-around nuttiness\" of the game lifted it into the same realm as Bomberman, or Worms. Nebojsa Radakovic of GameRevolution also stated that \"many of the death quotes are just hilarious.\"\n\nHowever, the game received less positive remarks towards the graphics used. Nebojsa Radakovic of \"GameRevolution\" stated the game's graphics were \"only so-so\" and the game contained too much \"texture warping and simple models.\" Scott Stienberg of \"IGN\" also called the graphics \"strikingly primitive\", and the game's graphics were \"dated\".\n\nOn 13 February 2008, Infogrames announced \"Hogs of War 2\" for Nintendo DS, Wii, PlayStation 2 and Windows. It was slated for release in April 2009, but is now presumed cancelled. During this period Infogrames was experiencing financial problems and was reincorporated as Atari, SA.\n\nThe PC version of the game was re-released by Urbanscan in late September 2014, and later added to GOG.com. The PlayStation version was released as a PS one Classic on the North American PlayStation Network store in 2013. The PC version was later re-released worldwide on Steam on 28 July 2015.\n"}

It was released as the third and final single from his debut album, Eazy-Duz-It. The song features fellow N.W.A members Dr. Dre and MC Ren and was produced by Dr. Dre and DJ Yella. \"We Want Eazy\" also appears on his greatest hits, \"Eternal E\"; a 12-inch remix of this song was released as a single in 1989 and appeared on the rapper's posthumous compilation, \"Featuring...Eazy-E\".\n\nThe song borrows heavily from the Bootsy's Rubber Band's 1977 song \"Ahh... The Name Is Bootsy, Baby!\". In exchange for the use of the sample, Bootsy Collins makes a cameo appearance with Eazy-E at the video's conclusion.\n\nThe music video for \"We Want Eazy\", directed by J. Kevin Swain, was released in 1988. It begins with Eazy being chased by a LAPD officer and dropping his signature black baseball cap along the way. Eventually he is arrested and jailed, just hours before he is to perform at a concert. With the help of his cellmates (including Ice Cube who manages to appear in the crowd as well and MC Krazy Dee), Eazy is able to perform via a giant screen closed-circuit television connection \"live from the Compton jail\", while Dr. Dre and MC Ren share the role of hype man on stage. Near the end of the video, Eazy breaks out of his cell and through the screen, and joins his bandmates on stage for the concert's finale.\n\nThe cover of both the remix and original versions of the \"We Want Eazy\" single depicts Eazy-E himself in front of a crowd. There is an alternate cover art that would later be parodied with the album cover for Dr. Dre's multi platinum debut album \"The Chronic\" and pays homage to the \"Zig-Zag\" cigarette rolling paper company which had become very prominent in Hip-Hop culture as it is most commonly used to wrap cannabis.\n\n"}

He has also played for bands and artists such as Annihilator, Extreme, James LaBrie, and Steve Vai. Before joining Dream Theater, Mangini was a faculty member at Berklee College of Music. Between 2002 and 2005, he set five World's Fastest Drummer records. Mangini appeared on the Discovery Channel show \"Time Warp\", displaying his drum skills for high speed cameras.\n\nBorn in Newton, Massachusetts, to Italian parents, Mangini first started playing the drums when he was two and a half years old, being inspired by Ringo Starr of The Beatles. He would practice two to four hours a day and by the time he was nine he was already mimicking Buddy Rich performances. Other influences include Bobby Colomby, Danny Seraphine, John Bonham, Neil Peart and Terry Bozzio.\n\nBy high school, he was performing in bands and participating in the prestigious All-State, and All-Eastern United States ensembles.\n\nAfter graduating from Waltham Senior High School in 1981, Mangini put aside his music studies to pursue a computer science major at Bentley University. After graduating he started programming software for the Patriot Missile program. At the same time, he was working on a program that studied the links between the human brain and body.\n\nIn 1987, Mangini scored one of his first high-profile gigs, playing drums for Boston's Rick Berlin Band. This would be his first collaboration with bassist Philip Bynoe. He also taught drums privately in Boston during this time.\n\nIn 1991, Mangini joined the thrash metal band Annihilator, playing drums on several tracks for the band's album \"Set the World on Fire\". He went on to tour with the band in support of this album until 1994. That year, he joined Boston hard rock band Extreme, replacing original drummer Paul Geary. Mangini played on three songs on Extreme's 1995 album \"Waiting for the Punchline\", and appeared with the band on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\".\n\nAfter Extreme disbanded in 1996, Mike was informed through drummer Jonathan Mover that guitarist Steve Vai was auditioning drummers for his live band. Mike successfully auditioned for Vai's band and relocated to Los Angeles. From late 1996 to early 2000, Mangini was the highly regarded drummer of Vai's live ensemble, which also included bassist Philip Bynoe, guitarist Mike Keneally and beginning in 2000, guitarist Dave Weiner. Mangini appeared on Vai's studio albums \"Fire Garden\" and \"The Ultra Zone\", and the live album \"Alive in an Ultra World\".\n\nDuring a hiatus on Vai's \"Ultra Zone\" tour in 2000, Mangini returned to Boston, where he served as an associate professor at Berklee College of Music. He also formed the short-lived band Tribe of Judah with former Extreme frontman Gary Cherone and bassist Pat Badger. Mangini appeared on other albums during this time, including a Rush tribute record entitled \"Subdivisions\" and a second Annihilator album titled \"All for You\". He also recorded tracks for artists Sal DiFusco, Bill Lonero and Chris Emerson.\n\nIn 2005, Mangini accepted a full-time teaching position at the Berklee College of Music in the Percussion Department. He resigned in 2010 after joining Dream Theater.\n\nIn late 2010, Mangini, along with Marco Minnemann, Peter Wildoer, Virgil Donati, Aquiles Priester, Derek Roddy and Thomas Lang, auditioned to succeed Mike Portnoy as the drummer for Dream Theater. He had previously appeared on three solo albums by Dream Theater's lead singer, James LaBrie. Mangini was announced as Dream Theater's new drummer on April 29, 2011, several months after he actually joined. He has appeared on every Dream Theater release since. \"Distance over Time\", Mangini's fourth studio album with Dream Theater, featured his debut as a lyricist, on the song \"Room 137\".\n\nMangini served as the drummer for Dream Theater bandmate John Petrucci on the G3 tour, along with bassist Dave LaRue, in 2012 and 2018.\n\nIn 2015, Mangini joined U.K. for their \"Final World Tour\". \n\nMike plays and endorses Pearl drums, hardware, pedals and percussion, Zildjian cymbals, Vater drumsticks, Remo drumheads and Shure microphones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2100581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100581", "title": "Lynching in the United States", "text": "Lynching in the United States\n\nLynching is the practice of murder by a group of people by extrajudicial action. Lynchings in the United States first became common in the South in the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s, at which time most of the victims were white men. Lynchings of blacks rose in number after the American Civil War during Reconstruction; they declined in the 1930s. Most lynchings were of African-American men in the Southern United States, but women and non-blacks were also lynched, not always in the South. White lynchings of blacks also occurred in the Midwestern United States and the border states, especially during the 20th-century Great Migration of blacks out of the Southern United States. The purpose was to enforce white supremacy and intimidate blacks through racial terrorism. According to Ida B. Wells and Tuskegee University, most lynching victims were accused of murder or attempted murder. Rape or attempted rape was the second most common accusation; such accusations were often pretexts for lynching blacks who violated Jim Crow etiquette or engaged in economic competition with whites. Sociologist Arthur F. Raper investigated one hundred lynchings during the 1930s and estimated that approximately one-third of the victims were falsely accused.\nOn a per capita basis, lynchings were also common in California and the Old West, especially of Latinos, although they represented less than 10% of the national total. Native Americans, Asian Americans, and Italian-Americans were also frequently lynched. Other ethnicities, including Finnish-Americans and German-Americans were also lynched occasionally.\n\nAccording to the Tuskegee Institute, 4,743 people were lynched between 1882 and 1968 in the United States, including 3,446 African Americans and 1,297 whites. More than 73 percent of lynchings in the post-Civil War period occurred in the Southern states. According to the Equal Justice Initiative, 4,084 African-Americans were lynched between 1877 and 1950 in the South.\n\nThe stereotype of a lynching is a hanging because hangings are what crowds of people saw and are also easy to photograph. Some hangings were professionally photographed and sold as postcards, which were popular souvenirs in some parts of the U.S. \"Although most people think only of hanging, lynching means much more.\" Victims were also killed in a variety of other ways: shot repeatedly, burned alive, forced to jump off a bridge, dragged behind cars, and the like. Sometimes they were tortured as well; body parts were sometimes removed and sold as souvenirs in stores. Occasionally lynchings were not fatal (see ). A \"mock\" lynching, putting the rope around the neck of someone suspected of concealing information, might be used to compel \"confessions\" (see Lynn Council).\n\nLynchings were most frequent from 1890 to the 1920s, with a peak in 1892. Lynchings were often large mob actions, attended by hundreds or thousands of watchers. As in the case of Ell Parsons, they were sometimes announced in advance in newspapers and in one instance (Fred Rochelle) with a special train. However, in the later 20th century lynchings became more secretive, and were conducted by smaller groups of people.\n\nAccording to Michael Pfeifer, the prevalence of lynching in postbellum America reflects a lack of confidence in the \"due process\" judicial system. He links the decline in lynching in the early twentieth century with \"the advent of the modern death penalty\": \"legislators renovated the death penalty...out of direct concern for the alternative of mob violence\". He also cites \"the modern, racialized excesses of urban police forces in the twentieth century and after\" as having characteristics of lynching.\n\nOn April 26, 2018, in Montgomery, Alabama, The National Memorial for Peace and Justice opened. Founded by the Equal Justice Initiative of that city, it is the first large memorial to document lynchings of African Americans in the United States.\n\nPrior to the Civil War most of the victims of lynching in the South were white men. During the Reconstruction era lynchings were used to enforce white supremacy and intimidate blacks by racial terrorism. The rate of lynchings in the South has been strongly associated with economic strains, although the causal nature of this link is unclear. Low cotton prices, inflation, and economic stress are associated with higher frequencies of lynching.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution declared that all born in the United States were citizens, and the Fifteenth that all citizens could vote, regardless \"of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" These were regarded as self-destructive mistakes by many white Southerners. Some blamed freedmen for their own wartime hardships, post-war economic problems, and loss of social and political privilege. During Reconstruction, freedmen, and white people working in the South for civil rights, were attacked and sometimes lynched. Black voting was suppressed by violence as well as by poll taxes and literacy tests. Whites regained control of state legislatures in 1876, and a national compromise resulted in the removal of federal troops from the South in 1877. In later decades, violence continued around elections until blacks were disfranchised by the states from 1885 (see Florida Constitution of 1885) to 1908 through constitutional changes and laws that created barriers to voter registration across the South.\n\nWhites enacted Jim Crow laws to enforce blacks' second-class status. (See Nadir of American race relations.) During this period that spanned the late 19th and early 20th centuries, lynchings reached a peak in the South. Georgia led the nation in the number of lynchings from 1900 to 1931 with 302 incidents, according to The Tuskegee Institute. However, Florida led the nation in lynchings per capita from 1900 to 1930. Lynchings peaked in many areas when it was time for landowners to settle accounts with sharecroppers.\n\nThere is no count of recorded lynchings that claims to be precise, and the numbers vary depending on the sources, the years considered, and the definition used to define an incident. The Tuskegee Institute has recorded the lynchings of 3,446 blacks and 1,297 whites between 1882 and 1968, with the peak occurring in the 1890s, at a time of economic stress in the South and increasing political suppression of blacks. A five-year study published in 2015 by the Equal Justice Initiative found that nearly 3,959 black men, women, and children were lynched in the twelve Southern states between 1877 and 1950. Over this period Georgia's 586 lynchings led all states.\n\nAfrican Americans mounted resistance to lynchings in numerous ways. Intellectuals and journalists encouraged public education, actively protesting and lobbying against lynch mob violence and government complicity. Anti-lynching plays and other literary works were produced. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and related groups, organized support from white and black Americans, publicizing injustices, investigating incidents, and working for passage of federal anti-lynching legislation (which as of 2019 has still not passed). African-American women's clubs raised funds and conducted petition drives, letter campaigns, meetings, and demonstrations to highlight the issues and combat lynching. In the great migration, particularly from 1910 to 1940, 1.5 million African Americans left the South, primarily for destinations in northern and mid-western cities, both to gain better jobs and education and to escape the high rate of violence. From 1910 to 1930 particularly, more blacks migrated from counties with high numbers of lynchings.\n\nFrom 1882 to 1968, \"nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were introduced in Congress, and three passed the House. Seven presidents between 1890 and 1952 petitioned Congress to pass a federal law.\" None succeeded in gaining passage, blocked by the Solid South - the delegation of powerful white Southerners in the Senate, which controlled, due to seniority, the powerful committee chairmanships. During the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, black activists were attacked and murdered throughout the South. The 1964 Mississippi Burning murders galvanized public support for passage of Civil Rights legislation that year and the next.\n\nThe term \"Lynch's Law\" apparently originated during the American Revolution when Patriot Charles Lynch, a Virginia justice of the peace, ordered extralegal punishment for Loyalists. In the Antebellum South, members of the abolitionist movement and other people opposing slavery were sometimes targets of lynch mob violence.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Confederate Home Guard units sometimes lynched white Southerners whom they suspected of being Unionists or deserters. One example of this was the hanging of Methodist minister Bill Sketoe in the southern Alabama town of Newton in December 1864.\n\nA major motive for lynchings, particularly in the South, was the white society's efforts to maintain white supremacy after the emancipation of slaves following the American Civil War. It punished perceived violations of customs, later institutionalized as Jim Crow laws, which mandated racial segregation of whites and blacks, and second-class status for blacks. A 2017 paper found that more racially segregated counties were more likely to be places where whites conducted lynchings. Economic competition was another major factor; independent black farmers or businessmen were sometimes lynched or suffered destruction of their property. In the Deep South, the number of lynchings was higher in areas with a concentration of blacks in an area (such as a county), dependent on cotton at a time of low cotton prices, rising inflation, and competition among religious groups.\n\nWhites sometimes lynched blacks for financial gain, and sometimes to establish political or economic dominance. These lynchings emphasized the new social order constructed under Jim Crow; whites acted together, reinforcing their collective identity along with the unequal status of blacks through these group acts of violence. In much of the Deep South, lynchings peaked in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as white racists turned to terrorism to dissuade blacks from voting in a period of disenfranchisement. In the Mississippi Delta, lynchings of blacks increased beginning in the late 19th century as white planters tried to control former slaves who had become landowners or sharecroppers. Lynchings had a seasonal pattern in the Mississippi Delta; they were frequent at the end of the year when sharecroppers and tenant farmers tried to settle their accounts.\n\nIn the 1890s, African American journalist and anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells conducted one of the first thorough investigations of lynching cases. She found that black lynching victims were accused of rape or attempted rape about one-third of the time (although sexual infractions were widely cited as reasons for the crime). The most prevalent accusation was murder or attempted murder, followed by a list of infractions that included verbal and physical aggression, spirited business competition, and independence of mind among victims. Lynch mob \"policing\" usually led to white mobs murdering persons suspected of crimes or more casual infractions.\n\nLynchings also occurred in Western frontier areas where legal recourse was distant. In the West, cattle barons took the law into their own hands by hanging those whom they perceived as cattle and horse thieves. This was also related to a political and social struggle between these classes.\n\nLynchings were in part intended as a voter suppression tool. A 2019 study found that lynchings occurred more frequently in proximity to elections, in particular in areas where the Democratic Party faced challenges.\n\nHistorians have debated the history of lynchings on the western frontier, which has been obscured by the mythology of the American Old West. In unorganized territories or sparsely settled states, law enforcement was limited, often provided only by a U.S. Marshal who might, despite the appointment of deputies, be hours, or days, away by horseback.\n\nPeople often carried out lynchings in the Old West against accused criminals in custody. Lynching did not so much substitute for an absent legal system as constitute an alternative system dominated by a particular social class or racial group. Historian Michael J. Pfeifer writes, \"Contrary to the popular understanding, early territorial lynching did not flow from an absence or distance of law enforcement but rather from the social instability of early communities and their contest for property, status, and the definition of social order.\"\n\nIt is not known the exact number of people in the Western states/territories killed by lynching during the times of their occurrences. For Mexicans, there are, however, estimates of thousands of deaths that have gone undocumented and peaked in the 1850s and 1870s, then again in the 1910s, most likely due to the Mexican Revolution. The most recorded deaths were in Texas, with up to 232 killings, then followed by California (143 deaths), New Mexico (87 deaths), and Arizona (48 deaths). Lynch mobs killed Mexicans using many justifications for their actions, such as accusations of murder and robbery, which were the most common.\n\nBy the time of the California Gold Rush in 1848, at least 25,000 Mexicans had been longtime residents of California since the Spanish colonial period. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 expanded United States territory by one-third after the Mexican–American War. To settle the war, Mexico ceded all of Arizona, California, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah as well as parts of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Wyoming to the United States, and recognized the U.S. state of Texas as part of the Union.\n\nIn September 1850, California became the 31st state of the United States.\n\nMany of the Mexicans who were native to what would become a state within the United States were experienced miners, and they had great success mining gold in California. Their success aroused animosity by white prospectors, who intimidated Mexican miners with the threat of violence and committed violence against some. Between 1848 and 1860, white Americans lynched at least 163 Mexicans in California. On July 5, 1851, a mob in Downieville, California, lynched a Mexican woman named Josefa Segovia. She was accused of killing a white man who had attempted to assault her after breaking into her home.\n\nThe San Francisco Vigilance Movement has traditionally been portrayed as a positive response to government corruption and rampant crime, but revisionist historians have argued that it created more lawlessness than it eliminated. Four men were executed by the 1851 Committee of Vigilance before it disbanded. When the second Committee of Vigilance was instituted in 1856, in response to the murder of publisher James King of William, it hanged a total of four men, all accused of murder.\n\nDuring the same year of 1851, just after the beginning of the Gold Rush, these Committees lynched an unnamed thief in northern California. The Gold Rush and the economic prosperity of Mexican-born people was one of the main reasons for mob violence against them. Other factors include land and livestock, since they were also a form of economic success. In conjunction with lynching, mobs also attempted to expel Mexicans, and other groups, from areas with great mining activity and gold. As a result of the violence against Mexicans, many formed bands of bandits and would raid towns. One case, in 1855, was when a group of bandits went into Rancheria and killed six people. When the news of this incident spread, a mob of 1,500 people formed, rounded up 38 Mexicans, and executed Puertanino. The mob also expelled all the Mexicans in Rancheria and nearby towns as well, burning their homes.<ref>\n"}

Camphill communities are residential communities and schools that provide support for the education, employment, and daily lives of adults and children with developmental disabilities, mental health problems, or other special needs.\n\nThere are over 100 Camphill communities in more than 20 countries across Europe, North America, Southern Africa and Asia.\n\nThe movement was founded in 1939 at Kirkton House near Aberdeen by a group that included Austrian paediatrician Karl König. It was König's view that every human being possessed a healthy inner personality that was independent of their physical characteristics, including characteristics marking developmental or mental disability, and the role of the school was to recognize, nurture and educate this essential self. The communities' philosophy, anthroposophy, states that \"a perfectly formed spirit and destiny belong to each human being.\" The underlying principles of König's Camphill school were derived from concepts of education and social life outlined decades earlier by anthroposophist Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925). Today there are over 100 communities worldwide, in more than 20 countries, mainly in Europe, but also in North America and Southern Africa.\n\nThe Camphill Movement takes its name from Camphill Estate in the Milltimber area of Aberdeen, Scotland, where the Camphill pioneers moved to with their first community for children with special needs in June 1940. Camphill Estate is now a campus of Camphill School Aberdeen. There are six Camphills in the Aberdeen area.\n\nThe Camphill School Aberdeen was noted in the HMI/Care Commission report for 2007 as meeting \"very good\" to \"excellent\" standards, The school also holds Autism Accreditation from the National Autistic Society.\n\nThe Botton village received the Deputy Prime Minister's Award for Sustainable Communities in 2005; the award cited the community's dedication to the ethos of sustainability and mutual respect, as well as their concrete achievements in these areas.\n\n\n\n"}

A graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy, Rolfe also was an Ivy Leaguer: a graduate, then long-time athletic director of Dartmouth College, and (from 1943–46) baseball and basketball coach at Yale University. \n\nRolfe was a native of Penacook, New Hampshire. He batted left-handed, threw right-handed, and was listed as tall and . \n\nWhile a student at Dartmouth, Rolfe spent the summer of 1930 playing for the Orleans town team in the Cape Cod Baseball League, where he was skippered by longtime major league player and manager Patsy Donovan.\n\nDuring his major league playing career, Rolfe was the starting third baseman on the New York Yankees of the late 1930s. The \"Bronx Bombers\" of Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Bill Dickey, Lefty Gomez and Red Ruffing won American League pennants from 1936–39 and took all four World Series in which they appeared, winning 16 games and losing only three in Fall Classic play over that span. Rolfe played 10 major league seasons, all with New York, batting .289 with 69 home runs and 497 RBI in 1,175 games. His finest season came in 1939, when he led the American League with 213 hits, 139 runs scored, and 46 doubles while hitting .329 with 14 home runs and 80 runs batted in. He retired following the 1942 season.\n\nAfter his four-year coaching stint at Yale, Rolfe coached the Toronto Huskies of the BAA in 1946–1947 and returned to the Yankees as a coach. After the season, Rolfe joined the Detroit Tigers as director of their farm system. But he returned to the field after only one season, when he succeeded Steve O'Neill as Tiger manager after the campaign.\n\nIn , Rolfe's first season as manager, the Tigers improved by nine games and returned to the first division. Then, in , they nearly upset the Yankees, winning 95 games and finishing second, three games behind. A fluke botched double play was the team's undoing. Late in September at Cleveland, the Indians had the bases loaded in the tenth inning with one out and the score tied. Visibility was poor because smoke from Canadian forest fires was blowing across Lake Erie. On an apparent 3-2-3 double-play grounder to first base, Detroit catcher Aaron Robinson thought he simply needed to touch home plate for a force play to retire the Indians baserunner charging in from third. But in the smoky conditions Robinson had not seen that a putout had already been made at first base, necessitating that the catcher tag the \"runner\", not the \"plate\", to record an out. Robinson mistakenly tagged the plate, the run counted and Cleveland won the game. It was the turning point in the pennant race, for the postwar Tigers, and for Rolfe's managerial career.\n\nBeset by an aging starting rotation, the Tigers faltered in , slipping to 73 wins and finishing fifth, 25 games behind New York. Then Detroit completely unraveled in , winning only 23 of 72 games under Rolfe. On July 5, he was fired and replaced by one of his pitchers, Fred Hutchinson. The 1952 club won only 50 games, losing 104 – the first time ever that the Tigers lost 100 or more games.\n\nRolfe then returned to Dartmouth as the athletic director of his alma mater from 1954 to 1967. The college's baseball diamond is named in his honor. Rolfe died in Gilford, New Hampshire, in 1969 at age 60 of chronic kidney disease. He was buried in his birthplace of Penacook.\n\n\n"}

It was during his caliphate that the center of power of the Fatimid dynasty was moved from Ifriqiya (modern Tunisia) to Egypt. The Fatimids founded the city of \"al-Qāhirah\" (Cairo) \"the Victorious\" in 969 as the new capital of the Fatimid caliphate in Egypt.\n\nAfter the Fāṭimids, under the third caliph, al-Mansur Billah (946-953), had defeated the Khārijite rebellion of Abu Yazid, they began, under his son al-Mu‘izz, to turn their attentions back to their ambition of establishing their caliphate throughout the Islamic world and overthrowing the Abbasids. Although the Fāṭimids were primarily concerned with Egypt and the Near East, there were nevertheless campaigns fought by General Jawhar as-Siqilli against the Berbers of actual Morocco and the Umayyads of Spain. At the same time, Fatimid raids on Italy enabled naval superiority in the Western Mediterranean to be affirmed, at the expense of Byzantium, even capturing Sicily for a period of time.\n\nThe way to Egypt was then clear for the Fāṭimids, the more so given the state of crisis that the incumbent Ikhshidid dynasty found itself in and the inability of the Abbasids to counterattack. The country fell to Jawhar in 969 without any great resistance. After he had secured his position, al-Muʻizz transferred the royal residence from Al-Mansuriya to the newly founded city of \"Qāhirat al-Muʻizz\" \"al-Muʻizz's Victory\", i.e. Cairo, thereby shifting the centre of gravity of the Fatimid realm eastwards. In Africa, the Zirids were installed as regents. In Egypt, several attacks by the Carmathians had to be fought off (972-974) before the restructuring of state finances under Yaqub ibn Killis could be embarked upon. Al-Muʻizz was succeeded by his son Al-Aziz (975-996).\n\nAl-Muʻizz was renowned for his tolerance of other religions, and was popular among his Jewish and Christian subjects. He is also credited for having commissioned the invention of the first fountain pen. In 953, al-Muizz demanded a pen which would not stain his hands or clothes, and was provided with a pen which held ink in a reservoir. As recorded by Qadi al-Nu'man al-Tamimi (d. 974) in his \"Kitāb al-Majālis wa 'l-musayarāt\", al-Mu’izz commissioned the construction of the pen instructing:\n\nFatimid Literature rose to a certain height of prominence in the period of Al Muizz with the emergence of skilled poets like Ibn Hani al Andalusi and Ali al Tunusi. Ibn Hani was often compared to Al Mutanabbi and hailed as the Mutanabbi of the West.\n\nCoptic Christians were allowed a degree of freedom under al-Muizz. Copts were among those appointed to the highest offices of the empire and were allowed to freely practice their religion. Under Al-Muizz, the viceroy of Syria was Quzman ibn-Nima, a Copt who remained a Christian. The Nayrouz festival, the celebration of the Coptic New Year, was permitted though prohibitions on some of the activities, such as fire illumination and water splashing, were instituted.\n\nThe relationship between al-Muizz and the Copts of Egypt has been the subject of a number of legends written later by Coptic Christians. One such legend involves al-Muizz challenged Pope Abraham of Alexandria to move the Mokattam mountain in Cairo, recalling a verse in the Gospel of Matthew which says:If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. According to Coptic sources, Pope Abraham of Alexandria ordered the Coptic community to keep vigil and to pray for three days and nights. On the third night, Pope Abraham had a dream in which Mary directed him to search for Simon the Tanner. The legend continues that with the prayers of the Coptic community, led by the Pope and Simon, the Mokattam mountain moved. This story is recounted in the book \"History of the Patriarchs of Alexandria\", written by Severus Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ.\n\nLater Coptic sources would further assert that this miracle led al-Muizz to convert to Christianity, and that he was baptized at the church of Saint Mercurius in Cairo in a baptismal font that continues to exist to this day, and which known today as the \"Sultan's Baptistry\". According to this legend al-Muizz abdicated the throne in favor of his son, and spent the rest of his life in a monastery. This story is rejected by influential Muslim historians such as Ahmad Zaki Pasha and Muhammad Abdullah Enan.\n\nSources differ on al-Mu'izz's consorts. According to one version, he married a cousin of his, who gave him two sons, including his successor al-Aziz. Other sources report that his main consort (\"al-Sayyida al-Mu'iziyya\"), and mother of al-Aziz, was a Bedouin slave-girl from Arabia named Durzan, who due to her beautiful singing voice (although this may simply reflect a common stereotype about Arabian women) was nicknamed \"taghrīd\" (\"twittering\"). Al-Mu'izz had several other sons, but two are known by name: Tamim and Abdallah, who was the designated heir-apparent but died before his father. He also had seven daughters, of whom three are known with some detail: Sitt al-Malik, Rashida, and Abda. The last two died in their nineties in 1050, leaving behind enormous fortunes.\n\n\n"}

Originally formed in World Championship Wrestling, the Dragons consisted of Kaz Hayashi, Yang, and Jamie-San and their manager Leia Meow. The Jung Dragons were notable for their high-flying, cruiserweight wrestling style and somewhat humorous Asian theme. However, Jamie-San, the only Caucasian in the group, was given the Japanese title of \"San\" and wore a black mask in order to conceal the fact that he was not Asian.\n\nThe group was put together in early 2000 by Jimmy Hart. He wanted to give the young talents a chance to tighten their skills in a feud with 3 Count, another young group formed by Hart, on WCW's lower rate program \"Saturday Night\". According to Hart, he also bought the Jung Dragon ring attire and worked with WCW's seamstress to give them their logo. Booker Kevin Sullivan was so impressed with the group that he immediately put them on WCW's prime program, \"Nitro\".\n\nThe Jung Dragons made their pay-per-view debut at New Blood Rising, losing a ladder match against 3 Count. From there, they participated in various tag team match types at Mayhem, Starrcade, Sin, and SuperBrawl Revenge and added a manager in Leia Meow. While the Dragons only scored one victory throughout these major events, the stable remained relatively popular up until the closure of WCW in 2001.\n\nBy late 2000, both the Jung Dragons and 3 Count had begun falling apart. Jamie-San departed from the Jung Dragons, during which he unmasked and was renamed to Jamie Knoble, and formed a tag team with ex-3 Count member Evan Karagias. The two competed with the remaining members of 3 Count and the Jung Dragons. Finally, in early 2001, WCW was purchased by top competitor World Wrestling Federation, ultimately ending the Jung Dragons.\n\nFollowing the closure of WCW, Jamie-San and Yang went on to work for World Wrestling Entertainment (the former World Wrestling Federation) as Jamie Noble and Akio, respectively. Noble won the Cruiserweight Championship shortly after his WWE debut and Akio found partial success as an ally of Tajiri before both were released in 2004 and 2005, respectively. After being released, Noble competed in Ring of Honor before being rehired in 2005, while Yang and Hayashi reformed the Jung Dragons before Yang was rehired in 2006 under the ring name Jimmy Wang Yang.

It was annexed and occupied by the United States later in 1810 and subsequently became part of eastern Louisiana.\n\nThe boundaries of the Republic of West Florida included all territory south of parallel 31°N, east of the Mississippi River, and north of the waterway formed by the Iberville River, Amite River, Lake Maurepas, Pass Manchac, Lake Pontchartrain, and the Rigolets. The Pearl River, with its branch that flowed into the Rigolets, formed the eastern boundary of the republic. A military expedition from the republic attempted but failed to capture the Spanish outpost at Mobile, which was situated between the Pearl and the Perdido River, farther to the east. Despite its name, none of the Republic of West Florida was within the borders of the present-day state of Florida, but rather entirely within the present borders of Louisiana and southern coastal counties of Mississippi.\n\nLouisiana parishes once part of the Republic of West Florida are:\n\nMississippi Counties once a part of the Republic of West Florida are:\n\nThe combined Louisiana parishes of East Baton Rouge, East Feliciana, St. Tammany, Tangipahoa and West Feliciana formed the area referred to as Baton Rouge District which was annexed to the United States in 1810.\n\nBefore 1762, France had owned and administered the land west of the Perdido River as part of \"La Louisiane\". In 1762, France signed a secret treaty with Spain that effectively ceded all French lands west of the Mississippi River, plus the Isle of New Orleans, to Spain. At the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763, France ceded its remaining lands east of the Mississippi River (which included the land between the Perdido and Mississippi Rivers) to Great Britain, while Spain ceded its Florida territory to Britain.\n\nTwenty years later, at the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War in 1783, Spain received both East and West Florida from Great Britain. The United States and Spain held long negotiations regarding the northern border of West Florida, concluding with Pinckney's Treaty in 1795.\n\nIn 1800, under duress from Napoleon of France, Spain ceded Louisiana and the island of New Orleans back to France, which promised to return them to Spain should France ever relinquish them. This cession did not include West Florida. In 1803, France then sold Louisiana and New Orleans to the United States. The U.S. claimed that West Florida was part of the Louisiana Purchase, a claim disputed by Spain, as it had controlled West Florida as a province separate from Spanish Louisiana since 1783.\n\nThere was an influx of Americans into West Florida in the early years of the 19th century. The population of the Baton Rouge District was almost exclusively Anglo-American with a substantial number of Tory immigrants of the revolutionary period. Some of the Americans were land speculators eager to profit should the territory join the U.S.\n\nDuring the decade after 1803, the U.S. southern border was the scene of many minor frontier events that involved diplomatic relations with Britain, France and Spain. In order to resolve the problems along that border and gain control of ports for commerce, the U.S. desired to possess all territory east of the Mississippi. West Florida occupied the land from the Mississippi River to beyond the Mobile River and also separated the United States' Orleans and Mississippi territories. (New Orleans and West Florida had been the prime U.S. desires in the negotiations with Napoleon that resulted instead in the Louisiana Purchase.)\n\nIn West Florida, from June to September 1810, many secret meetings of those who resented Spanish rule, as well as three openly held conventions, took place in the Baton Rouge District. Out of those meetings grew the West Florida rebellion and the establishment of the independent Republic of West Florida. Its capital was located at St. Francisville, in present-day Louisiana on a bluff along the Mississippi River.\n\nEarly in the morning on September 23, 1810, armed rebels stormed Fort San Carlos at Baton Rouge and killed two Spanish soldiers \"in a sharp and bloody firefight that wrested control of the region from the Spanish.\" The rebels unfurled the flag of the new republic, a single white star on a blue field made by Melissa Johnson, wife of Major Isaac Johnson, commander of the Feliciana cavalry engaged in the attack. (The \"Bonnie Blue Flag\" that was flown fifty years later at the start of the American Civil War resembles it.)\n\nAfter the successful attack, organized by Philemon Thomas, plans were made to take Mobile and Pensacola from the Spanish and incorporate the eastern part of the province into the new republic. Reuben Kemper led a small force in an attempt to capture Mobile, but the expedition ended in failure.\n\nFor some time, the governors of the Orleans and Mississippi territories, William C. C. Claiborne and David Holmes, respectively, had been U.S. President James Madison's two chief agents in securing intelligence on West Florida. Upon learning of the revolt, Madison wanted to move quickly to annex the district but knew he could not use the military without congressional approval. Congress would not meet until December 1810. Military occupation would incur the wrath of Spain and perhaps also Britain and France. He feared if he did not move, West Florida could fall into unfriendly hands, as a considerable part of the population had previously been British subjects.\n\nThough troubled by \"constitutional qualms\", Madison did not want to let the opportunity pass unexploited and \"resorted to the oldest justification in the political book: he acted, even without clear ... authority on the grounds that 'a crisis has at length arrived subversive of the order of things under the Spanish authorities.' \" Critics quickly condemned the president \"for acting without proper authority and for supplanting the jurisdiction of the Spanish, friends who had done nothing to deserve such aggression.\"\n\nSupport for the revolt was far from unanimous. The presence of competing pro-Spanish, pro-American, and pro-independence factions, as well as the presence of scores of foreign agents, contributed to a \"virtual civil war within the Revolt as the competing factions jockeyed for position.\" The faction that favored the continued independence of West Florida secured the adoption of a constitution at a convention in October. The convention had earlier commissioned an army under General Philemon Thomas to march across the territory, subdue opposition to the insurrection, and seek to secure as much Spanish-held territory as possible. \"Residents of the western Florida Parishes proved largely supportive of the Revolt, while the majority of the population in the eastern region of the Florida Parishes opposed the insurrection. Thomas' army violently suppressed opponents of the revolt, leaving a bitter legacy in the Tangipahoa and Tchefuncte River regions.\"\n\nClaiborne and Holmes had to contend with the armed force under Thomas and the fact that those in control were determined not to submit to the United States without terms in regard to land titles and to refugees. The two governors took steps to prepare the minds of the people to receive them and at the same time to overwhelm possible opposition by a show of force.\n\nOn November 7, Fulwar Skipwith was elected as governor, together with members of a bicameral legislature. For several weeks, he personally directed the preparations for the dispatch of the armed force to wrest the remainder of West Florida from Spain. Skipwith's inauguration ceremony was held on November 29. A week later, he and many of his fellow officials still lingered at St. Francisville preparing to go to Baton Rouge, where the next session of the legislature was to consider his ambitious program. The impending takeover apparently came as a surprise to Skipwith when Holmes and his party approached the town. Holmes persuaded all except a few leaders, including Skipwith and Philemon Thomas, the leader of the West Florida troops, to acquiesce to American authority.\n\nSkipwith complained bitterly to Holmes that, as a result of seven years of U.S. tolerance of continued Spanish occupation, the United States had abandoned its right to the country and that the West Florida people would not now submit to the American government without conditions. Skipwith and several of his unreconciled legislators then departed for the fort at Baton Rouge, rather than surrender the country unconditionally and without terms.\n\nAt Baton Rouge on December 9, Skipwith informed Holmes that he would no longer resist but could not speak for the troops in the fort. Their commander was John Ballinger, who upon the assurance of Holmes that his troops would not be harmed, agreed to surrender the fort. Claiborne and his forces landed two miles above the town. Holmes reported to Claiborne that \"the armed citizens ... are ready to retire from the fort and acknowledge the authority of the United States\" without insisting upon any terms. Claiborne agreed to a respectful ceremony to mark the formal act of transfer. Thus, at 2:30 p.m. that afternoon, December 10, 1810, \"the men within the fort marched out and stacked their arms and saluted the flag of West Florida as it was lowered for the last time, and then dispersed.\"\n\nSkipwith later expressed his gratitude at the result of the intervention, but he criticized bitterly the method by which Madison and Claiborne had brought it about. He stated his belief that a surrender of the territory by \"the constitutional authorities thereof as an independent state\" was the only method that could give the United States \"an unqualified and legal title\" to its possession. Claiborne himself reported that much of the resentment aroused among the people in West Florida by Madison's proclamation arose from the fact that it was not thought to be sufficiently respectful toward their constituted officials.\n\nCongress passed a joint resolution, approved January 15, 1811, to provide for the temporary occupation of the disputed territory and declaring that the territory should remain subject to future negotiation. On March 11, 1811, rebellious elements again raised the Lone Star flag of the West Florida Republic, forcing Governor Claiborne to dispatch troops to enforce his authority. Spain did not agree to relinquish its title to any of the West Florida territory occupied by the United States until 1819, upon the signing of the Adams–Onís Treaty.\n\nThe Constitution of the Republic of West Florida was based largely on the United States Constitution, and divided the government into three branches: executive, judicial, and legislative. The legislature consisted of a Senate and House of Representatives. The Governor was chosen by the legislature. According to the constitution, the official name of the country was the \"State of Florida\".\n\nFulwar Skipwith, the first and only governor of the Republic of West Florida, was a cotton planter who lived just north of Baton Rouge. He was appointed by George Washington in 1795 to the staff of James Monroe, the U.S. ambassador to France, and was a consul general to France under President Thomas Jefferson. Shortly after moving to Baton Rouge in 1809, he became involved in the effort to free West Florida from Spanish domination. The former American diplomat had helped negotiate the Louisiana Purchase. In his inaugural address, Skipwith mentioned the possibility of annexation to the United States:\n\nThe marching song of the West Floridian army included these lyrics in verse six:\n\nThe United States did not recognize the independence of the Republic of West Florida, and on October 27, 1810, President James Madison of it, on the basis that it was part of the Louisiana Purchase. In his proclamation, Madison invoked the portion of the Louisiana Purchase agreement that directly quoted the 1800 St. Ildefonso treaty between France and Spain: Louisiana, Madison stated, had \"the same extent that it had in the hands of Spain, and that it had when France originally possessed it.\" However, neither the 1800 treaty nor the 1803 purchase includes the word \"originally\"; instead, they state, \"with the same extent that it now has in the hands of Spain and that it had when France possessed it.\" Madison's tweak served his annexation rationale but had no basis in the treaty language.\n\nWilliam C. C. Claiborne, the military governor of Orleans Territory, was sent to take possession of the territory. The West Florida government opposed annexation, preferring to negotiate terms to join the Union. Governor Skipwith proclaimed that he and his men would \"surround the Flag-Staff and die in its defense.\"\n\nClaiborne entered St. Francisville with a U.S. Army contingent of 300 from Fort Adams under Col. Leonard Covington on December 6, 1810, and Baton Rouge on December 10, 1810. After Claiborne refused to recognize the West Florida government, Skipwith and the legislature eventually agreed to accept Madison's annexation proclamation. Congress passed a joint resolution, approved January 15, 1811, to provide for the temporary occupation of the disputed territory and declaring that the territory should remain subject to future negotiation.\n\nAccording to the French negotiator of the Louisiana Purchase, François Barbé-Marbois, \"The Louisianans themselves agreed that [the Baton Rouge district] had been considered to belong to Florida, but, nevertheless, the [state legislature] declared, by one of its first acts that this district of country was a portion of Louisiana. ... but this eagerness to strengthen doubtful pretensions by possession, does not accord with the spirit of justice that characterizes the other political acts of the United States.\"\n\nThe Mobile District, now coastal Mississippi and Alabama, remained under Spanish control until the War of 1812 with Britain, with whom Spain was allied. On May 14, 1812, the claimed portion of West Florida east of the Pearl River was assigned to Mississippi Territory, though at the time, the area around Mobile Bay remained under the control of Spanish Florida. Following that Congressional declaration of annexation and an act of February 12, 1813, (3 Stat. L. 472) authorizing the President to occupy that area, U.S. General James Wilkinson sailed from New Orleans to Mobile in April 1813 with a force of 600, whereupon he received the surrender of the Spanish commander.\n\nIn the state of Louisiana, the civil parishes (equivalent to counties elsewhere in the U.S.) that comprised the former Republic of West Florida are known today as the Florida Parishes. This is partly due to their short-lived independent state, but also in recognition of their heritage in a (British, then Spanish) colonial province extending eastward to modern Florida.\n\n\n\n"}

Its purpose is to receive and store sperm from the male or, in the case of hermaphrodites, the male component of the body. Spermathecae can sometimes be the site of fertilization when the oocytes are sufficiently developed.\n\nSome species of animal have multiple spermathecae. For example, certain species of earthworms have four pairs of spermathecae—one pair each in the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th segments. The spermathecae receive and store the spermatozoa of another earthworm during copulation. They are lined with epithelium and are variable in shape: some are thin, heavily coiled tubes, while others are vague outpocketings from the main reproductive tract. It is one of the many variations in sexual reproduction.\n\nThe nematode \"Caenorhabditis elegans\" has two spermathecae, one at the end of each gonad. The \"C. elegans\" spermatheca is made up of 24 smooth muscle-like cells that form a stretchable tubular structure. Actin filaments line the spermatheca in a circumferential manner. The \"C. elegans\" spermatheca is used as a model to study mechanotransduction.\n\nAn apiculturist may examine the spermatheca of a dead queen bee to find out whether it had received sperm from a male. In many species of stingless bees, especially Melipona bicolor, the queen lays her eggs during the provisioning and oviposition process and the spermatheca fertilizes the egg as it passes along the oviduct. The haplo-diploid system of sex determination makes it possible for the queen to choose the sex of the egg.\n\n"}

He was educated at Cowbridge Grammar School and Jesus College, Oxford, graduating with a BA in 1822, an MA in 1824, a BCL in 1827 and a DCL in 1829. Whilst studying at Oxford, he was ordained deacon in 1822 and priest in 1823 by the bishop of Oxford. Lewellin was, in 1826, offered, and accepted, the headmastership of Bruton Grammar School, Somerset. Instead of taking this up, however, he went to Saint David's College (now the University of Wales, Trinity Saint David), as its first principal in 1827. His initial appointments were as professor of Greek and senior professor of Theology, as well as that of Principal. He remained as principal until his death, two days after giving a lecture in Greek. He was buried in the churchyard of St Peter's church, Lampeter. Lewellin was active in wider Lampeter life; he was vicar of Lampeter and served on the magistrates' bench at nearby Aberaeron.

{"id": "2100643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100643", "title": "Drvar", "text": "Drvar\n\nDrvar (Cyrillic: Дрвар, ) is a town and municipality located in Canton 10 of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As of 2013 census, the municipality has a population of 7,506 inhabitants. It is situated in western Bosnia and Herzegovina, on the road between Bosansko Grahovo and Bosanski Petrovac, also near Glamoč.\n\nDrvar lies in the vast valley, the southeastern part of Bosanska Krajina, between the Osječanica, Klekovača, Vijenca and Šator mountains of the Dinaric Alps. The southeast side of boundary extends from the Šator over Jadovnika, Uilice and descends to Lipovo and the Una River.\n\nThis extremely hilly region comprising the town of Drvar and the numerous outlying villages covers approximately 1,030 square kilometers (640 square miles). The town itself is mainly spread out from the left side of the river Unac, and its elevation is approximately 480 meters (1,574 feet).\n\nThe word Drvar stems from the Slavic word \"\"drvo\"\" which means \"wood\". During the period of socialist Yugoslavia, Drvar was named \"Titov Drvar\" in honor of Josip Broz Tito.\n\nThe first writings on Drvar date back to the 9th century. In the first half of the 16th century (approximately 1530) residents of this area, under the leadership of a Vojnović from Glamoč, migrated to the surroundings of Zagreb (Metlika Zumberak and four surrounding villages). The greater area was populated in Roman Times as evidenced by the remains of Roman roads and signposts.\n\nIn 1878 Drvar, along with the rest of Bosnia, was subjugated to Austro-Hungarian rule. Around 1893 German industrialist leased the right to exploit fir and spruce forests in the mountains of Klekovača, Lunjevače, Srnetica and Osječenica. Steinbeis operated in the area until 1918 when, after the First World War, the company was taken over by the new Yugoslav state. During the 25 years that Steinbeis operated in the area, he created a complete infrastructure for processing forest products including the construction of modern lumber mills in Drvar and Dobrljin, and the construction of a network of roads and 400 km of narrow-gauge railway, and telephone and telegraph lines. During this time Drvar grew into an industrial town employing approximately 2,800 persons in which homes, hospitals, restaurants, cafe and retails shops were built. Additional factories appeared in Drvar, including a cellulose factory opened by Alphons Simunius Blumer.\n\nEventually, poor labor conditions led to the first organized strikes in Drvar in 1906. These strikes continued until 1911 when the Austro-Hungarian Empire banned all such activities.\n\n1918 saw the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the rise of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, but this did not help the plight of the workers in Drvar, who became better organized and rose up to strike again in 1921.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Drvar was part of the Vrbas Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In 1932, an economic crisis resulted in the layoff of 2,000 workers.\n\nOn April 10, Ustaše, aligned with Nazi Germany, declared the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) and claimed as part of its territory the entire area known as Bosnia and Herzegovina. In Drvar, this resulted in the beginning of the presence of the Ustaše government, the movement chiefly responsible for the World War II Holocaust in the Independent State of Croatia in which Serbs, Jews, Roma, Croat and Bosniak resistance members and political opponents were sent to concentration camps and killed. In the beginning the Ustaše contingent in Drvar consisted of the Croatian population residing in Drvar, but they were soon reinforced by others who came from outside Drvar.\n\nIn June 1941 Ustaše arrested a large group of prominent Drvar citizens, and took them to Risovac near Bosanski Petrovac, where they were tortured, killed and thrown into a pit. After Ustaše imprisoned all Serb men from Drvar during June and July 1941, they began with preparation to imprison and kill all Serbs from Drvar, regardless of ther age and sex, including all women and children. \n\nThe genocidal activities of the Ustaše forced targeted Serb population to organize an uprising known as Drvar uprising. The rebels were organized into Kamenički, Javorje, Crljivičko-zaglavički, Boboljusko-cvjetnički, Trubarski, Mokronog and Tičevski, and Grahovo area Grahovsko-resanovski guerrilla detachments.\n\nIn more recent history, Drvar is perhaps most famous as the location of a daring airdrop raid on Drvar, codenamed \"Operation Rösselsprung\", on May 25, 1944, by Nazi German invaders, in an attempt to assassinate Tito. Tito, the main Partisan commander, was sheltered in the Partisan General Staff headquarters in what is now called \"Tito's Cave\" in the hills near Drvar at the time.\n\nDuring the 4 years and 1 months of the war, Drvar was under occupation for just 390 days. 767 Drvar civilians were killed and only 13 pre-war houses still stood. Approximately 93% of the infrastructure of the town was destroyed, and the livestock population had been reduced by more than 80%.\n\nDrvar was first occupied by the German army in April 1941, followed shortly thereafter by the Italians. Drvar continued to experience fierce fighting through mid-1942 when the last of the German and Italian forces were expelled. The Germans re-entered Drvar in 1943 and left it a burned ruin when they departed.\n\nDuring the summer 1941, Chetniks expelled and killed Croat and Catholic civilians in Drvar area. The most significant event was the Trubar massacre, a civilian massacre committed by Chetniks on 27 July 1941.\n\nIn the years following the war, Drvar was rebuilt, its timber industry restored, and new metal, fabrication, and carpet industries developed. Eventually, electricity was brought to outlying villages. Over time, it became a tourist destination attracting approximately 200,000 visitors a year, primarily to Tito's Cave, and on November 24, 1981, Drvar changed its name to Titov Drvar.\n\nIn 1995, Drvar (as well as some other municipalities) was taken over by Croatian forces, and the Serb population fled. Many of them moved to Banja Luka. During this period, Drvar was nearly deserted. Leading up to 1995, Drvar was populated almost entirely by Bosnian Serbs. During the Bosnian War between 1992 and 1995, Drvar was controlled by what is now called the Republika Srpska.\n\nOn 3 August 1995, the Croatian Armed Forces with the help of Bosnian Croats began shelling Drvar, from the mountain of Šator. Two Drvar citizens were killed and older men and women began to evacuate to Petrovac. One day later, the Croatian Government armed forces began \"Operation Storm\", called by European Union Special Envoy to the Former Yugoslavia Carl Bildt, \"the most efficient ethnic cleansing we've seen in the Balkans\", in the \"Dalmatinska zagora\" region of Croatia, and columns of hundreds of thousands of refugees in cars, on tractors, wagons and on foot began to pass through Drvar as they fled their homes in Croatia. The shelling on the outlying areas of Drvar by Croatian Government forces was renewed and continued for days.\n\nIn late 1995, after the Dayton Peace Accord was signed, Drvar became part of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, after which Croat politicians enticed up to 6,000 Bosnian Croats, mainly displaced persons from central Bosnia, to move to Drvar, by promising such things as jobs and keys to vacant homes. A further 2,500 Croat HVO troops and their families were stationed there, also occupying the homes of displaced Bosnian Serb citizens. This drastically changed the population and from 1995-1999 the population was primarily Croatian.\n\nIn 1996, small numbers of Serbs began to try to return to their homes but faced harassment and discrimination by the Croats. The return continued nonetheless despite the ongoing looting and burning of their homes in 1996-1998.\n\nIn 1998, Croat opposition to the return of displaced Bosnian Serb citizens culminated in riots and murders. Buildings and houses were torched, United Nations International Police Task Force personnel, SFOR personnel and Mayor, Mile Marceta (elected with Serb refugee votes) were attacked, and two displaced elderly Serbs who had recently returned to Drvar were murdered.\n\nMuch of the damage done to the town of Drvar was done not during the war, but during its subsequent occupation by Croat civilians and military personnel as the homes and business of displaced Bosnian Serbs attempting to return to Drvar were looted and burned. The local government and companies, the few that exist, are dominated by the Croats, and Serbs have difficulty finding employment.\n\nSince the end of the Bosnian War, about 5,000 Bosnian Serb residents have returned to Drvar. However, unemployment in the town stands at 80% and many residents blame the government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina for the poor economic situation.\n\nIn September 2019, the President of Serbia Aleksandar Vučić made an official visit to Drvar, along with the Serb Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Milorad Dodik.\n\nDrvar is a member of the Alliance of Serb Municipalities. \nAside from the town of Drvar, the following settlements comprise the municipality:\n\n\nDrvar was already well known in the Austrian-Hungarian era due to the high-quality wood coming from that area. The Drvar area is still one of the largest logging and wood-processing environments in BiH. One of the major problems in this area is the widespread corruption connected to this wood-processing industry. It is estimated that during 2004 about 110,000m of wood 'disappeared'. Average price of 1m of timber (second class) is about 100 km (100 Konvertible Mark = 50 Euros).\n\nA \"Desant na Drvar\" is a movie made about the German attack on Drvar. There are still some locations in area, which were heavily fought over in that period, that still seem to be untouched by time.\n\nFamous landmarks include \"Tito's Cave\" and the so-called \"Citadel\". At the latter mentioned location one can find an Austrian-Hungarian cemetery (in a very poor state) which may contain some (unknown) number of German soldiers buried after the attack of 1944. On this spot there is also a Roman road sign (+/- 100 AD). Another one can be found on the way to Bosanski Petrovac near Zaglavica.\n\nDrvar is also renowned for its local rakija, a type of plum or cranberry brandy, originating in Serbia but popular all over the Balkans.\n\n\n"}

As Shiryu, he was part of the memorable rudo group, Kaientai Deluxe, which waged war with Michinoku Pro's Sekigun for many years, producing some classic matches. In June 1997, he left Michinoku Pro for the Mexican Promo Azteca promotion, before joining World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in the United States in October of that year.\n\nAfter unmasking, Hayashi joined WCW in 1998. Early on, he was relegated to a jobber and comedy character. He would be taken under the management of Sonny Onoo and even come to inherit Glacier's ceremonial armor and light show for a time. In late 1999, Vince Russo and Ed Ferrara began booking WCW programs and Hayashi was paired with La Parka. During interviews, the two would speak in their native languages which would be humorously dubbed over by charismatic English speakers, calling him names such as \"The Kaz Master\" and \"Kazanova\". This ended shortly when La Parka became upset and tossed the microphone down as Ferrera was speaking.\n\nIn mid-2000, Hayashi formed the stable The Jung Dragons along with Jamie-San and Yang. Primarily feuding with 3 Count, the Jung Dragons consisted of high-flying cruiserweight talent and gained considerable popularity until the group's demise the following year. During this time, he became friends with Keiji Mutoh, who was appearing in his final run with the promotion under his Great Muta guise.\n\nHayashi's contract was bought by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) following their purchase of WCW in early 2001. He was first sent to WWF's developmental territory the Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA) before being moved to the main roster. Hayashi made his WWF main roster debut during the Invasion storyline as a member of The Alliance faction but only made one appearance before returning to HWA and ultimately heading back to Japan.\n\nAfter returning to Japan, Hayashi eventually decided to join All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) due to his friendship with Keiji Mutoh and established himself as one of their top stars, winning the World Junior Heavyweight Championship and both the World Tag Team Championship and the All Asia Tag Team Championship with Satoshi Kojima. In 2006, Hayashi won the AJPW Junior League tournament.\n\nNow under the name Miguel Hayashi Jr., Hayashi, PEPE Michinoku, and El NOSAWA Mendoza formed a team during the AJPW Champion Carnival called Mexico Amigos. Nobutaka Araya joined the team after six-man Action between Mexico Amigos and Araya/Fuchi/Hirai at the Carnival's final show.\n\nAfter multiple bouts against Minoru Suzuki, Nosawa offered Suzuki an invitation into Mexico Amigos, which he declined. This resulted in the group changing multiple assets. Their name was changed to Mexico Amigos Black, the previous worn Mexican Flag attire became Black and Gold attire, and Nobutaka Araya was kicked out of the group. The groups is currently in a heated rivalry with Mazada's Samurai New Japan group, Minoru Suzuki, and Voodoo Murders.\n\nAt AJPW's \"Fan Appreciation Day\" show, The Mexico Amigos teamed with Ray Suzuki and defeated Ryuji Hijikata, Kikutaro, T28 and Ryuji Yamaguchi. After the match, Ray Suzuki revealed himself as Minoru Suzuki and stated that starting next year he would throw his Amigos tights away and return to NOSAWA Rongai, then kidnapped him to start early training. This led to Pepe and Miguel stating they would return to Mexico, but Kaz and Taka would return come the new year. After one last \"Viva Mexico\", the Mexico Amigos disbanded.\n\nOn February 6, 2009, Hayashi defeated Naomichi Marufuji to win the World Junior Heavyweight Championship for a second time. During Hayashi's 23-month reign, he successfully defended the title a record–breaking seventeen times. He would lose the title to Minoru on January 2, 2011.\n\nIn June 2013, Hayashi announced his resignation from All Japan in the aftermath of Nobuo Shiraishi taking over as the president and Keiji Mutoh leaving the promotion. Hayashi's final match for the promotion took place on June 30 and saw him and his longtime tag team partner Shuji Kondo, who was also leaving All Japan, unsuccessfully challenge Burning (Atsushi Aoki and Kotaro Suzuki) for the All Asia Tag Team Championship.\n\nOn July 10, 2013, Hayashi was announced as part of Keiji Mutoh's new Wrestle-1 promotion. During the promotion's inaugural event on September 8, Hayashi teamed with Shuji Kondo in a tag team match, where they were defeated by the Big Japan Pro Wrestling team of Daisuke Sekimoto and Yuji Okabayashi. As part of a working relationship between Wrestle-1 and American promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), Hayashi and Kondo earned a shot at the TNA World Tag Team Championship by defeating Desperado (Kazma Sakamoto and Masayuki Kono) on February 15, 2014. On March 2 at , Hayashi and Kondo unsuccessfully challenged The Wolves (Davey Richards and Eddie Edwards) for the TNA World Tag Team Championship in a three-way match, which also included The BroMans (Jessie Godderz and Robbie E), who went on to win the match and become the new champions. On September 22, Hayashi entered the Wrestle-1 Championship tournament, but was defeated in his first round match by Kondo. On October 12, Hayashi worked TNA's Bound for Glory event in Tokyo, unsuccessfully challenging Samoa Joe for the TNA X Division Championship in a three-way match, which also included Low Ki. In November, Hayashi and Kondo took part in the First Tag League Greatest tournament, set to determine the inaugural Wrestle-1 Tag Team Champions, where they finished second in their block with a record of three wins and one loss, advancing to the semifinals. On November 30, Hayashi and Kondo first defeated Kai and Ryota Hama in the semifinals and then Akira and Manabu Soya in the finals to win the tournament and become the inaugural Wrestle-1 Tag Team Champions. After seven successful title defenses, they lost the title to Soya and Jun Kasai on July 12, 2015. On October 9, Kondo broke off his partnership with Hayashi. On January 31, 2016, Hayashi, Minoru Tanaka and Tajiri won the vacant UWA World Trios Championship. They lost the title to Andy Wu, Daiki Inaba and Seiki Yoshioka in their fifth defense on July 29. On September 18, Hayashi and Kotaro Suzuki won the vacant Wrestle-1 Tag Team Championship. They lost the title to Koji Doi and Kumagoro on March 20, 2017.\n\nOn March 27, 2017, it was announced that Hayashi would become Wrestle-1's new president on April 1 with Shuji Kondo as his vice president.\n\n\n"}

Originally a wapentake or subdivision of the West Riding of Yorkshire it later had a unique status as a rural area controlled by the corporation of the city.\n\nThe Ainsty covered a few square miles situated to the west of York. It was bounded by three rivers: the Nidd to the north; the Ouse to the east and the Wharfe to the south. The Ainsty was unique among the wapentakes of Yorkshire in that it was not formally included in any Ridings from 1449 until 1836.\n\nThe Ainsty is now divided between the City of York, the Borough of Harrogate and Selby District, all in North Yorkshire.\n\nThe Ainsty is first recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 (in the form \"Ainestig\"), when it was a wapentake of the West Riding of Yorkshire. It was named from Ainsty Cliff at Bilbrough, presumably the original meeting place of the wapentake. Ainsty Cliff was itself named from a small narrow path which led from Steeton Farm over Ainsty Cliff to Bilbrough. The word Ainsty is from Old English \"ān stiga\", meaning \"one-man path\" or \"narrow path\", which became \"einstigi\" in Old Norse.\n\nThe city of York later claimed jurisdiction over the area under a royal charter of King John granted in the early 13th century. The validity of this charter was a matter of dispute between the city and the Crown, eventually leading to the imprisonment of the mayor in 1280 when it was proved that a clause in the document had been altered. The bailiffs of the city were subsequently able to resume jurisdiction of the wapentake, although it was not formally included in the city when it was created a county of itself in 1396.\n\nIn 1449 the Ainsty was annexed to York, with the sheriffs of the city assuming authority. The city, which was said to be \"in decay\", was granted the \"privileges and franchises\" of the Ainsty to improve its financial position. In 1463 the mayor and aldermen were made justices of the peace with the commission of oyer and terminer.\n\nThe Municipal Corporations Act 1835 reformed the city of York as a municipal borough with effect from 1 January 1836. It was unclear if the reformed corporation still had jurisdiction in the Ainsty. The matter was finally settled by the Municipal Corporations (Boundaries) Act 1836 which came into force in August. Under the legislation the Ainsty was declared to be part of the West Riding for all purposes. When elected county councils were created by the Local Government Act 1888, the Ainsty's inclusion in the West Riding was confirmed.\n\nLike other similar subdivisions of counties, although the Ainsty was never formally abolished, it ceased to have any function in the latter half of the 19th century. The former area of the wapentake is now divided between the unitary City of York and the districts of Harrogate and Selby in North Yorkshire.\n\nBy the 19th-century, the Ainsty had two divisions: the eastern, or York Division, and the western, or Tadcaster Division.\n\nFrom 1866 the wapentake comprised the following civil parishes:\nThe Ainsty gives its name to the Selby and Ainsty parliamentary constituency, first contested at the general election of 2010, and the New Ainsty Deanery of the Church of England.\n\nThe Ainsty Bounds Walk is a footpath around Ainsty.\n\nAinsty is also the name of a residential area of Wetherby developed in the 1950s, including Ainsty Road, Ainsty Crescent, Ainsty Drive and Ainsty View.\n\nThe Ainsty is the name of a public house in the Acomb area of York.\n\nAinsty also gives its name to Ainsty Court inside Halifax College, a college within the University of York.\n\n"}

It worked directly with the Administration and the three primary cultural agencies: the National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services, as well as other federal partners and the private sector, to address policy questions in the arts and humanities, to initiate and support public/private partnerships in those disciplines, and to recognize excellence in the field. Its core areas of focus were arts and humanities education, cultural exchange, and the creative economy.\n\nThe committee was composed of both private and public members. The private members were appointed by the President and are prominent artists, philanthropists, entrepreneurs and state and local public officials who demonstrated commitment to the arts and humanities. Its public ex officio members included the heads of the National Endowment for the Arts; the National Endowment for the Humanities; the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences; the Departments of Education, Interior, and State; the National Gallery of Art; the Smithsonian Institution; the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts; and the Library of Congress. The President also appointed a chairman or co-chairmen from among the private members.\n\nIn August 2017, all private committee members resigned in protest of President Donald Trump's response to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Authority for the Committee subsequently lapsed on September 30 under the provisions of Executive Order 13708.\n\nThe PCAH was established by Executive Order 12367 of June 15, 1982. It has conducted major research and policy analysis, and catalyzed important federal cultural programs, both domestic and international. PCAH's website states, \"These achievements rely on the PCAH's unique role in bringing together the White House, federal agencies, civic organizations, corporations, foundations and individuals to strengthen the United States' national investment in its cultural life. Central to the PCAH mission is using the power of the arts and humanities to contribute to the vibrancy of our society, the education of our children, the creativity of our citizens and the strength of our democracy.\"\n\nTurnaround Arts was a national program that brings arts education to high-poverty elementary and middle schools across the country. It was the first federal program to specifically support arts education as an improvement tool in the country’s lowest-performing schools, and was run by the PCAH, in coordination with the White House, the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE), and several foundations.\n\nThe National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Awards recognized the country’s best creative youth development programs for increasing academic achievement, graduation rates and college enrollment by engaging children and youth in the arts and humanities. Formerly titled Coming Up Taller, these annual awards focused national attention on outstanding programs across the country that promoted the creativity of America's young people, providing them learning opportunities and the chance to contribute to their communities. Accompanied by a cash award and a ceremony at the White House with the First Lady, the National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Awards not only rewarded these projects with recognition but also provided organizational and capacity building support over the course of the year.\n\nThe PCAH, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, and the nonprofit Alliance for Young Artists & Writers partnered to present the National Student Poets Program (NSPP), the nation’s highest honor for young poets (grades 9-11) presenting original work. Five students were annually selected for one year of service as literary ambassadors, each representing a geographic region of the country. By elevating and showcasing their work for a national audience, the program strived to inspire other young people to achieve excellence in their own creative endeavors and promote the essential role of writing and the arts in academic and personal success.\n\nSundance Film Forward is an international touring program designed to enhance greater cultural understanding, collaboration and dialogue around the globe by engaging audiences through the exhibition of films, workshops and conversations with filmmakers. Sundance Film Forward is an initiative of the Sundance Institute, which partnered with the PCAH and other federal arts programs.\n\nEstablished by Executive Order in 1998, Save America's Treasures (SAT) is a federal public-private partnership that includes the NEA, NEH, IMLS, the National Park Service (NPS), the American Architectural Foundation (AAF) and formerly the PCAH. The PCAH and the National Park Service jointly oversaw the management of the federal competitive matching grant component, which helps preserve, conserve, and rescue our nation's most significant cultural and heritage resources, including historic structures, collections of artifacts, works of art, maps, manuscripts, and sound recordings. Although funding for the program was suspended, the PCAH and AAF convened a series of thought leadership forums to develop elements for framing and catalyzing a preservation strategy that built on the strengths and success of SAT.\n\nThrough its work with the private sector, the PCAH was able to raise private resources, which were directed to special initiatives that supported youth programs, recognized artists, broadened arts awareness, and celebrated the nation’s cultural life. Examples include:\n\n\nOn August 18, 2017, 16 of the 17 committee members, including Kal Penn and Chuck Close, resigned in protest of President Donald Trump's response to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.

The only member of the committee who did not sign the letter was theater and film director George C. Wolfe, whose representatives stated that he, too, would be resigning and would add his name to the letter. PCAH became the first White House department to quit the Trump administration.\n\nThe White House responded with a statement reading in part, \"Earlier this month it was decided that President Trump will not renew the Executive Order for the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities (PCAH), which expires later this year.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

There is a profound drop in tissue oxygen consumption since the reaction of oxygen with cytochrome oxidase is blocked by the presence of cyanide. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion on cytochrome oxidase a and prevents the fourth and final reaction in the electron transport chain. This completely stops oxidative phosphorylation and prevents the mitochondria from producing ATP. There are other chemicals that interrupt the mitochondrial electron transport chain (e.g., rotenone, antimycin A) and produce effects on tissue oxygenation similar to that of cyanide. Oxygen extraction decreases in parallel with the lower oxygen consumption, with a resulting increase in venous oxygen content and PvO2. Although cyanide stimulates the peripheral respiratory chemoreceptors, increasing the inspired oxygen fraction is not helpful, since there is already an adequate amount of oxygen which the poisoned cells cannot use.\n\nCyanide antidote kit is a widely used method in treating cyanide induced histotoxic hypoxia. It consists of three different parts that are administered one after the other. The three parts are amyl nitrite, sodium nitrite, and sodium thiosulfate. The nitrites act with hemoglobin to form methemoglobin which binds cyanide. Cyanide has a preference to the ferric ion on methemoglobin over the ferric ion on cytochrome oxidase a and causes cyanide to be drawn out of the mitochondria. This causes the mitochondria to produce ATP again and stop histotoxic hypoxia.\n\nHistotoxic hypoxia can be a consequence of ischemia in the case of stroke or inflammation. In the case of inflammation, neuro-inflammatory diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis can all lead to histotoxic hypoxia. During a stroke, there is an interruption in the blood supply followed by reperfusion which leads to histotoxic hypoxia because of an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the case of inflammatory diseases, histotoxic hypoxia can also be triggered by ROS from mitochondrial damage in the active lesions of chronic multiple sclerosis. Inflammatory mediators such as heme oxygynase-1(HO-1) can result in histotoxic hypoxia when they are released in excess and cause the sequestration of iron as in the cases of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis.\n\n"}

{"id": "2100703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100703", "title": "Hair fetishism", "text": "Hair fetishism\n\nHair fetishism, also known as hair partialism and trichophilia, is a partialism in which a person sees hair most commonly, head hair as particularly erotic and sexually arousing. Arousal may occur from seeing or touching hair, whether head hair, armpit hair, chest hair or fur. Head-hair arousal may come from seeing or touching very long or short hair, wet hair, certain colors of hair or a particular hairstyle. Pubephilia is sexual arousal at the sight or feel of pubic hair.\n\nHaircut fetishism is a related paraphilia in which a person is aroused by having their head hair cut or shaved, by cutting the hair of another, by watching someone get a haircut, or by seeing someone with a shaved head or very short hair.\n\nTechnically, hair fetishism is called trichophilia, which comes from the Greek \"\"trica-\"\" (τρίχα), which means hair, and the suffix \"\"-philia\"\" (φιλία), which means love.\n\nHair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals. In humans, hair can be scalp hair, facial hair, chest hair, pubic hair, axillary hair, besides other places. Men tend to have hair in more places than women. Hair does not in itself have any intrinsic sexual value other than the attributes given to it by individuals in a cultural context. Some cultures are ambivalent in relation to body hair, with some being regarded as attractive while others being regarded as unaesthetic. Many cultures regard a woman's hair to be erotic. For example, many Islamic women cover their hair in public, and display it only to their family and close friends. Similarly, many Jewish women cover their hair after marriage. During the Middle Ages, European women were expected to cover their hair after they married, and according to the New Testament, a Christian woman should cover her head while in a church or in prayer.\n\nEven in cultures where women do not customarily cover their hair, the erotic significance of hair is recognised. Some hair styles are culturally associated with a particular gender, with short head hair styles and baldness being associated with men and longer hair styles with women and girls, even though there are many exceptions such as Gaelic Irish men, and also depictions of men in art throughout history, the most notable example probably being that of Jesus Christ. In the case of women especially, head hair has been presented in art and literature as a feature of beauty, vanity and eroticism. Hair has a very important role in the canons of beauty in different regions of the world, and healthy combed hair has two important functions, beauty and fashion. In those cultures, considerable time and expense is put into the attractive presentation of hair and, in some cases, to the removal of culturally unwanted hair.\n\nHair fetishism manifests itself in a variety of behaviors. A fetishist may enjoy seeing or touching hair, pulling on or cutting the hair of another person. Besides enjoyment they may become sexually aroused from such activities. It may also be described as an obsession, as in the case of hair washing or dread of losing hair. Arousal by head hair may arise from seeing or touching very long or short hair, wet hair, a certain color of hair or a particular hairstyle. Others may find the attraction of literally \"having sex with somebody's hair\" as a fantasy or fetish. The fetish affects both men and women.\n\nSome people feel pleasure when their hair is being cut or groomed. This is because they produce endorphins giving them a feeling which is similar to that of a head massage, laughter, or caress. On the other hand, many people feel some level of anxiety when their head hair is being cut. Sigmund Freud stated that cutting woman's long hair by men may represent a fear and/or concept of castration, meaning that a woman's long hair represents a figurative penis and that by cutting off her hair a man may feel dominance as castrator, not the castrated one (while paradoxically also being reassured by the fact that the hair will grow again).\n\nTrichophilia may present with different excitation sources, the most common, but not the only one, being human head hair. Trichophilia may also involve facial hair, chest hair, pubic hair, armpit hair and animal fur. The excitation can arise from the texture, color, hairstyle and hair length. Among the most common variants of this paraphilia are excitation by long hair and short hair, the excitement of blonde hair (blonde fetishism) and red hair (redhead fetishism) and the excitement of the different textures of hair (straight, curly, wavy, etc.). Trichophilia can relate to the excitement that is caused by plucking or pulling hair or body hair.\n\nHair fetishism comes from a natural fascination with the species on the admiration of the coat, as its texture provides pleasurable sensations. An infant develops this kind of pleasure to feel the hair on his or her early life, manifesting as aggressive behavior that will drive to pull the hair of people with which it interacts. Trichophilia is considered a paraphilia which is usually inoffensive.\n\nIn order to determine the relative prevalence of different fetishes, scientists obtained a sample of at least 5000 individuals worldwide, in 2007, from 381 Internet discussion groups. The relative prevalences were estimated based on (a) the number of groups devoted to a particular fetish, (b) the number of individuals participating in the groups and (c) the number of messages exchanged. Of the sampled population, 7 percent were sexually aroused by hair (as opposed to 12 for underwear, but only 4 for genitals, 3 for breasts, 2 for buttocks, and less than one for body hair).\n\n"}

It was called by several names: Natory Airfield, Masda Airfield, and Yatory Airfield. In 1943, the Miho Army Flight Center moved into Sendai Airport and facilities were expanded and later reformed into the Sendai Army Flight School.\n\nAt the end of World War II, the United States Army took control of the airport and its operations. In 1956, it was returned to Japan and transferred to the Ministry of Defense. The Ministry of Transport was designated to administer and use it.\n\nIn 1957, the runway was extended to and Nippon Helicopter Transport (now All Nippon Airways) established a route from Tokyo's (Haneda Airport) to Sendai. When the airport began to service commercial jets on 14 February 1970, runway 09/27 was extended to . Also, the flight school of Japan Ground Self Defense Force moved into North Utsunomiya Army Post.\n\nBeginning 6 April 1990, Asiana Airlines established a route from Seoul (Gimpo International Airport) to Sendai, thus beginning international service from the airport. Air China began scheduled service to Beijing via Dalian in 1994, which was followed by services to Shanghai and Changchun.\n\nIn 1992, Runway 09/27 was extended further to and 5 years later, in 1997, a new terminal was opened and the runway was extended further to .\n\nThe Sendai Airport Line rail link was completed on 18 March 2007 and began service between and Sendai Airport Station. The \"Smile Terrace\" observation deck opened on 19 March 2010.\n\nOn 11 March 2011, the airport was damaged by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and then badly flooded by the subsequent tsunami. In addition to submerging the tarmac, taxiways and runway, the floodwaters reached up to parts of the 2nd level of the passenger terminal, rendering electrical equipment, transformers and safety equipment inoperable. Operations at Sendai as well as Odate-Noshiro Airport and Sado Airport, which had been controlled by Sendai Airport control tower, were suspended. Some 1300 people were stranded within the terminal until 13 March, when they were evacuated. By 17 March military engineers partially opened the airport for tsunami response flights.\n\nTo reopen the airport, on 16 March 2011, a U.S. Air Force MC-130P Combat Shadow from the 17th Special Operations Squadron infiltrated a team from the 320th Special Tactics Squadron from Kadena Air Base into Matsushima, Miyagi, then moved overland to the airport. With assistance from Japan Self-Defense Forces, enough debris was removed in a few days to allow an MC-130H Combat Talon II aircraft to begin landing with more equipment, personnel, and supplies. After further cleanup with help from additional US and Japanese military units, on 20 March 2011 a US Air Force C-17 landed at the airport with 40 metric tons of relief supplies. Thereafter, the airport served as a transit location for airlifted supplies, totaling approximately 2 million tons of such items as blankets, water, and food. The US military set up and operated air traffic control operations for the airport until shortly before commercial traffic resumed, at which point air traffic control responsibility was resumed by Japanese controllers.\n\nThe airport reopened to limited commercial traffic on 13 April 2011. Japan Airlines and ANA conducted a total of six flights a day to Tokyo Haneda Airport upon resumption of services, with Japan Airlines also offering limited flights to Osaka Itami airport.\n\nAlthough most international services from Sendai came back online following the 2011 disaster, most services between Sendai and China were suspended or cancelled between 2012 and 2013 due to worsened Sino-Japanese relations. Asiana Airlines also reduced the frequency of its Sendai-Seoul service in September 2013. Despite the reduction in China and Korea service, 2013 saw new service from Sendai to Bangkok and Honolulu as well as new charter service to Taipei.\n\n\nThe main passenger terminal building was designed by Japanese American architect Gyo Obata, of the St. Louis architecture firm Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum.\n\nThere are 4 floors in the terminal:\n\nThe airport has 8 Jet bridges to handle aircraft coming and leaving the airport.\n\nThe west end of the terminal services domestic routes and the east side international routes.\n\nThe control tower, Tokyo Regional Civil Aviation Bureau office and Air Cargo Terminal are located on the west side of the main terminal building.\n\nTo the south side of the airport are the facilities for small private aircraft, helipads (4) and aircraft hangars.\n\nThe Sendai Airport Line, which connects the airport to Sendai Station, opened on 18 March 2007. The journey to the downtown core of the city takes 17–25 minutes. After the earthquake and tsunami service was suspended until 1 October of that year.\n\nThe airport can be accessed by car via Sendai-Tobu Toll Road via Route 20. There are two car parks located near the terminal building (Parking 1 with 970 spots) and east side of the airport property (Parking 2 with 250 spots).\n\nBuses and taxis also service the airport and located outside the Domestic Terminal:\n\n\nThe airlines that operate at the airport mainly fly to domestic destinations. The few international flights are to destinations in the Far East.\n\nBecause of the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami, all scheduled service (except for humanitarian flights) were suspended from 11 March 2011 until 13 April 2011. Limited services resumed on 13 April 2011, although not all original Sendai destinations were served. Regular domestic flights resumed on 25 July 2011 and most international flights resumed in October 2011.\n\n"}

The school offers day, weekly and flexible boarding for approximately 715 pupils.\n\nSt John’s was founded in 1851 to educate the sons of the clergy, and was moved from St John’s Wood, London to its current site in Surrey in 1872. Set in 50 acres, the school’s site is a mixture of old and new, with mid-Victorian architecture complemented by a Science Centre, and modern classroom blocks and boarding houses.\n\nThe school was founded in 1851 as St John's Foundational School for the Sons of Poor Clergy. Its founder was a clergyman, Ashby Haslewood, who was vicar of St Mark's, Hamilton Terrace in St John's Wood, north London. He had a dual purpose in founding the school - to offer free education for the sons of poor clergymen and to provide a choir for his large church. \n\nSince the 1970s St John's, while maintaining a substantial boarding community, has taken in an increasing number of day pupils and in 1989 the first Sixth Form girls entered the school. In 2010 girls were able to join the school in the first year (fourth form) for the first time and the school has been fully co-educational since September 2012.\nThe school was a success but the dual purpose imposed restrictions. So in 1854 the school moved outside the parish boundaries of St Mark's into neighbouring Kilburn. This was the first of three moves before the school moved to Leatherhead in 1872. Reverend Edward Connerford Hawkins was one of the first headmasters, when the school was still at Clapton in north-east London. He and his wife Jane Isabella Grahame (an aunt of Kenneth Grahame, author of \"Wind in the Willows\") brought up their family there; their son Anthony Hope, who also grew up to be an author, was educated at the school until he was old enough to be sent to Marlborough College.\nDespite much progress, it remained essentially a charity school until the significant headmastership of Arthur Rutty (HM 1883–1909) when the school developed all the characteristics of a public school.\n\nThe school began to attract fee-paying parents while remaining loyal to the sons of poor clergymen. The school expanded throughout the 20th century despite the problems faced by all public schools due to the Depression. After the Second World War, St John's was fortunate to attract the interest of the Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, himself the son of a clergyman, who was chairman of the governing body from 1951 to 1966. Montgomery's contribution to the development of the school was enormous – he promoted it, raised money for it and gave generously of his own time and wealth. His assistance facilitated the building of the new chapel, completed in 1962, as the school had outgrown the more diminutive old chapel, which subsequently became the library, and from 2014, a venue for concerts and other events for both the school and local community. The pews towards the back of the new chapel have the names inscribed of those who died in conflict ranging from the First World War to the Korean War. The 1914–1919 roll remembers the 156 who fell in battle, the 1939–1945 panel contains 88 names, and the Korean War board bears 3 names.\n\nSt John's is divided into ten Houses each with its own characteristics and Housemaster/mistress. There are six boys' houses and four girls' houses.\n\n\nSouth – renamed from Hallaton – is a girls' house and comprises two buildings. Haslewood and Gloucester are both located in the heart of the school on the quad, whilst Hawkins shares its building with Churchill, opening its doors to pupils for the first time in September 2019.\n\nThe school competes on a circuit across a wide variety of sports, and some pupils have gained representative honours at county, national and international level. Rugby, football, hockey, netball and cross country are major sports at St John’s, alongside cricket, athletics, tennis and swimming during the summer months. During the autumn term, boys’ teams focus on rugby and girls’ teams compete in hockey. The spring term sports are football, netball, cross country, boys’ hockey and rugby sevens. The school offers the following as additional competitive sports: badminton, biathlon, fives, golf, rounders, sailing, skiing, squash, shooting. Pupils also have the opportunity to participate in recreational sports, including Pilates, Zumba, indoor rowing, volleyball, wakeboarding and off-road cycling.\n\nThe first recorded match on the school cricket ground came in 1879 when the school played the Marylebone Cricket Club. Since then the school has used the ground for a number of fixtures against other schools and colleges. The ground has also held 2 List-A matches, the first of which came in 1969 when Surrey played Northamptonshire in the Player's County League. The second and final List-A match at the ground came in 1972, when Surrey played Worcestershire in the John Player League.\n\nAt St John’s, pupils have the option to try a range of activities. From Japanese to chess, from honing cricket skills to building a hovercraft or philosophical debates, there is an extensive list of opportunities, as well as art, music, drama, the combined cadet force, Duke of Edinburgh award and the school’s community service unit.\n\nSt John's is a participant in the Combined Cadet Force (compulsory for one year) and the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme.\nCCF has been a part of St John’s for over 100 years, and was founded in 1912. Today’s CCF comprises over 350 cadets, across Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force sections. All Lower Fifth (Year 10) pupils take part in the CCF’s weekly training sessions, and can choose to continue in later years if they wish to. The St John’s CCF is affiliated to HMS COLLINGWOOD (Royal Navy), Coldstream Guards (British Army) and RAF ODIHAM (Royal Air Force).\n\nSt John’s runs a community service unit, with just over half of the school’s sixth form taking part in weekly volunteer placements in the local community. These placements take place during evenings, weekends and free periods.\n\nThe school has a number of notable alumni - see List of people educated at St John's School, Leatherhead\n\n\n\nThe school lent its name to the fortieth example of the Southern Railway's V Class steam locomotive, no. 939. This class was known widely as the Schools Class because all forty of the class were named after prominent English public schools. 'Leatherhead', as no. 939 was called, was built in 1934. The locomotive bearing the school's name was withdrawn in the early 1960s. A nameplate survives in the reception at the school, along with a small model of the engine.\n"}

Although he was not the legitimate heir to the throne his father made him the heir for being the son of his favourite wife Kantavati Devi.\n\nHe was the son of King Rana Bahadur Shah, and ascended the throne at the age of 1 and 1/2 years when his father abdicated to become an ascetic. He ruled under the regency of Queen Lalit Tripura Sundari and Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa. He died at age 19 and was succeeded by his young son Rajendra Bikram Shah.\n\nThe Gorkha War (1814–1816), or the Anglo–Nepalese War, was fought between the Kingdom of Nepal and the British East India Company as a result of border disputes and ambitious expansionism of both the belligerent parties. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Sugauli in 1816, which ceded around a third of Nepal's territory to the British. Most of the ceded territories of Nepal in the war were in the west and some in the east near the kingdom of Sikkim which had never been a part of India.\n\nThe British were the invading forces, while the Nepalese maintained a defensive position. The British attacked in two successive waves of invasion. It was the most expensive war waged during the governorship of Lord Moira.\n\nColonel Ranabir Singh Thapa, brother of Bhimsen Thapa, was to be the Sector Commander of Makawanpur-Hariharpur axis. He was given a very large fortress and about 4,000 troops with old rifles and a few pieces of cannons. But the British could not move forward from the border. Colonel Ranabir Singh Thapa had been trying to lure the enemies to his selected killing area. But Major General Wood would not venture forward from Bara Gadhi and he eventually fell back to Betiya.\n\nWith the help of an ousted Palpali king, Major General Wood planned to march on Siuraj, Jit Gadhi and Nuwakot with a view to bypass the Butwal defenses, flushing out minor opposition on the axis, and assault Palpa from a less guarded flank. Nepalese Colonel Ujir Singh Thapa had deployed his 1200 troops in many defensive positions including Jit Gadhi, Nuwakot Gadhi and Kathe Gadhi. The troops under Colonel Ujir were very disciplined and he himself was a dedicated and able commander. He was famous for exploiting advantage in men, material, natural resources and well versed in mountain tactics. The British advance took place on 22nd Poush1871 BS (January 1814 AD) to Jit Gadh. While they were advancing to this fortress, crossing the Tinau River, the Nepalese troops opened fire from the fortress. Another of the attackers’ columns was advancing to capture Tansen Bazar. Here too, Nepalese spoiling attacks forced the General to fall back to Gorakhpur. About 70 Nepalese lost their lives in Nuwakot Gadhi. Meanwhile, more than 300 of the enemy perished.\n\nNo special military action had taken place in Hariharpur Gadhi fortress in the first campaign. Major General Bannet Marley and Major General George Wood had not been able to advance for an offensive against Makawanpur and Hariharpur Gadhi fortresses.\n\nThe Battle of Nalapani was the first battle of Anglo-Nepalese War. The battle took place around the Nalapani fort, near Dehradun, which was placed under siege by the British between 31 October and 30 November 1814. The fort's garrison was commanded by Captain Balbhadra Kunwar, while Major-General Rollo Gillespie, who had previously fought at the Battle of Java, was in charge of the attacking British troops. The failure to obey the field orders by his men led Gillespie to be killed on the very first day of the siege while rallying his men. Despite considerable odds, both in terms of numbers and firepower, Balbhadra and his 600-strong garrison successfully held out against more than 3,000 British troops for over a month.\n\nAfter two costly and unsuccessful attempts to seize the fort by direct attack, the British changed their approach and sought to force the garrison to surrender by cutting off the fort's external water supply. Having suffered three days of thirst, on the last day of the siege, Balbhadra, refusing to surrender, led the 70 surviving members of the garrison in a charge against the besieging force. Fighting their way out of the fort, the survivors escaped into the nearby hills. The battle set the tone for the rest of the Anglo-Nepalese War, and a number of later engagements, including one at Jaithak, unfolded in a similar way.\n\nThe experience at Nalapani so discomforted the British that Lord Hastings so far varied his plan of operations as to forego the detachment of a part of this division to occupy Gurhwal. He accordingly instructed Colonel Mawbey to leave a few men in a strong position for the occupation of the Doon and to carry his undivided army against Amar Singh's son, Colonel Ranajor Singh Thapa, who was with about 2300 elite of the Gurkha army, at Nahan. It was further intended to reinforce the division considerably; and the command was handed over to Major-General Martindell. In the meantime Colonel Mawbey had led back the division through the Keree pass, leaving Colonel Carpenter posted at Kalsee, at the north western extremity of the Doon. This station commanded the passes of the Jumna on the main line of communication between the western and eastern portions of the Gurkha territory, and thus was well chosen for procuring intelligence.\n\nMajor General Martindale now joined the force and took over command. He occupied the town of Nahan on 27 December, and started his attach on the fort of Jaithak. The fort had a garrison of 2000 men under the command of Ranajor Singh Thapa, the son of the Amar Singh Thapa. The first assault ended in disaster, with the Nepalese successfully warding off the British offensive. The second managed to cut off the water supply to the fort, but could not capture it mainly because of the exhausted state of the troops and shortage of ammunition. Martindale lost heart and ordered a withdrawal. Jaithak was eventually captured much later in the war, when Ochterlony had taken over the command.\n\nA single day of battle at Jaithak cost the British over three hundred men dead and wounded and cooled Martindell's ardour for battle. For over a month and a half, he refused to take any further initiative against the Nepalese army. Thus by mid-February, of the four British commanders the Nepalese army had faced till that time, Gillespie was dead, Marley had deserted, Wood was harassed into inactivity, and Martindell was practically incapacitated by over-cautiousness. It set the scene for Octorloney to soon show his mettle and change the course of the war.\n\nThe Treaty of Sugauli was ratified on 4 March 1816. As per the treaty, Nepal lost Sikkim (including Darjeeling), the territories of Kumaon and Garhwal, and most of the lands of the Terai. The Mechi River became the new eastern border and the Mahakali river the western boundary of the kingdom. The British East India Company would pay 200,000 rupees annually to compensate for the loss of income from the Terai region. Kathmandu was also forced to accept a British Resident. The fear of having a British Resident in Kathmandu ultimately proved to be unfounded, as the rulers of Nepal managed to isolate the Resident to such an extent as to be in virtual house arrest.\n\nThe Terai lands, however, proved difficult for the British to govern and some of them were returned to the kingdom later in 1816 and the annual payments accordingly abolished. However even after the conclusion of the Anglo-Nepalese War, the border issue between the two states was not yet settled. The boundary between Nepal and Oudh was not finally adjusted until 1830; and that between Nepal and the British territories remained as a matter of discussion between the two Governments for several years later.\n\nThe British never had the intention to destroy either the existence or the independence of a state which was usefully interposed between them and the dependencies of China. Lord Hastings had given up his plan to dismember Nepal from fear of antagonising China – whose vassal Nepal in theory was. In 1815, while British forces were campaigning in far western Nepal, a high-ranking Manchu official advanced with a large\nmilitary force from China to Lhasa; and the following year, after the Anglo-Nepalese treaty had been signed, the Chinese army moved south again, right up to Nepal's frontier. The Nepalese panicked, because memories were still vivid of the Chinese invasion of 1792, and there was a flurry of urgent diplomatic activity. Hastings sent mollifying assurances to the imperial authorities, and ordered the British Resident, newly arrived in Kathmandu, to pack his bags and be ready to leave at once if the Chinese invaded again.\n"}

{"id": "2100762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100762", "title": "West Florida Controversy", "text": "West Florida Controversy\n\nThe West Florida Controversy refers to two border disputes that involved Spain and the United States in relation to the region known as West Florida over a period of 37 years. The first dispute commenced immediately after Spain received the colonies of West and East Florida from the Kingdom of Great Britain following the American Revolutionary War. Initial disagreements were settled with Pinckney's Treaty of 1795.\n\nThe second dispute arose following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. The controversy led to the secession of part of West Florida, known as the \"Republic of West Florida\", from Spanish control in 1810, and its subsequent annexation by the United States. In 1819 the United States and Spain negotiated the Adams–Onís Treaty, in which the United States purchased the remainder of Florida from Spain. The treaty was ratified in 1821.\n\nBritain formed the territory of West Florida out of territory it received from Spain and France in the 1763 Treaty of Paris, which ended the French and Indian War (the Seven Years' War). In this treaty it received all of Spanish Florida from Spain, and nearly all of French Louisiana east of the Mississippi River from France. Finding the new territory too big to govern from one capital, the British divided it into two new colonies: West Florida, with its capital at Pensacola, and East Florida, with its capital at St. Augustine.\n\nTwenty years later, Britain ceded both Floridas to Spain following the American Revolutionary War. They did not, however, specify the boundaries of West Florida, which had changed over the course of British stewardship. In the British period West Florida's northern border was initially set at the 31st parallel north, but was moved to 32° 22′ in 1764 in order to give the West Floridians more territory, including the Natchez District and the Tombigbee District. Spain insisted that its West Florida claim extended fully to 32° 22′, but the United States asserted that the land between 31° and 32° 22′ had always been British territory, and therefore rightfully belonged to the United States. After years of disagreement, the dispute was finally resolved with Pinckney's Treaty in 1795, in which both parties agreed on the 31st parallel as the boundary between the United States and West Florida.\n\nBefore 1762 France had owned and administered the land west of the Perdido River as part of \"La Louisiane\". In 1762 France signed a secret treaty with Spain that, upon being revealed in 1764, had effectively ceded all French lands west of the Mississippi River, plus the island of New Orleans, to Spain.\n\nAt the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763, France ceded its remaining lands east of the Mississippi River, which included the land between the Perdido and Mississippi Rivers, to Great Britain, while Spain also ceded its Florida territory to Britain. The British created the colony of West Florida out of the French and Spanish cessions. In 1783 Great Britain returned East Florida and transferred West Florida to Spain, who ruled both provinces as separate and apart from Louisiana. In 1800, under duress from Napoleon of France, Spain agreed to restore Louisiana and the island of New Orleans to France, who in conversation had promised to return them to Spain should France ever relinquish them. On 15 October 1802, Charles IV issued a royal bill that made effective the transfer of Louisiana to France (\"with the same extent that it currently has, that it had under the power of France when she ceded it to my royal crown\") and the withdrawal of Spanish troops in the territory. When France then sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States in 1803, a dispute arose between Spain and the United States regarding whether West Florida was part of the Louisiana Purchase. The United States laid claim to the region of West Florida between the Mississippi and Perdido Rivers, asserting it had been part of French Louisiana. Spain held that such a claim was baseless.\n\nIn 1810, a group of discontented American and British settlers in the area of Baton Rouge learned that the Spanish colonial governor, who had feigned sympathy, was in fact mounting a force against them. They revolted by overrunning a Spanish garrison at Fort San Carlos in Baton Rouge on September 23, 1810, and declared the independence of the Republic of West Florida on September 26. On October 27, the United States president proclaimed that the territory should be annexed, and Spain, then embroiled in the Peninsular War with France, could do little to resist. On December 10, the United States military completed the forcible occupation and acquiescence of the Republic of West Florida.\n\nIn 1819 the United States and Spain negotiated the Adams–Onís Treaty, in which Spain transferred West Florida and all of East Florida to the United States in exchange for expunging American spoliation claims.\n\nBy terms of the treaty following the Seven Years' War \"in 1763, what was then known as Louisiana was divided between Great Britain and Spain. France lost by this treaty all her possessions in North America. In addition to Canada, she ceded to Great Britain the river and port of Mobile and all her possessions on the left side of the Mississippi, except New Orleans and the island on which it was situated. The residue of Louisiana was ceded to Spain in a separate and secret treaty. The cession of Florida to Great Britain was the price paid for the restoration of Cuba to Spain. Great Britain divided the territory into East and West Florida.\" \n\n\"Valid title by possession of her part of the ceded territory was acquired by Great Britain at once (1763). Spain failed to make good by occupancy her title until 1769, when [Alejandro] O'Reilly took formal possession. For six years, therefore, the Louisiana as France possessed it, and as Spain received it, included no territory between the Mississippi and Perdido rivers. In 1779-81 Spain acquired West Florida, as well as East Florida by right of conquest, confirmed by the treaty of 1783. By no logical process of reasoning can it be shown that Spain's independent title to West Florida thus acquired should be included in Spain's previously acquired title to Louisiana and the island of New Orleans,\" according to Chambers. \n\n\"By the treaty of October 1, 1800, between the French Republic and Spain, known as the St. Ildefonso treaty, Spain made a retrocession to France of the province of Louisiana as at that time possessed by Spain, and such as it was when France possessed it. …\nIt is important, in view of subsequent discussions and negotiations, to bear in mind that in the transfer [of Louisiana to the United States] the identical language was employed that had been used in 1800, so that the government of the United States was subrogated, in express terms, to the rights of France and of Spain. … The United States insisted that by the treaty of 1800 Spain ceded the disputed territory [of West Florida], as part of Louisiana, to France, and that France, in turn, in 1803, ceded it to the United States. Spain, with equal earnestness and persistence, maintained that her cession to France comprehended what was at that time denominated Louisiana, consisting of the island of New Orleans and the country west of the Mississippi. … The very forcible contention of the United States was enfeebled somewhat by the declaration of Talleyrand, that by the treaty of St. Ildefonso Spain retroceded no part of the territory east of the Iberville, which had been held and known as West Florida, and that, in all the negotiations between the two governments, Spain had constantly refused to cede any part of the Floridas, even from the Mississippi to the Mobile.\" \n\n\"Spain upheld her claim to the Floridas and consistently insisted from beginning to end of the territorial controversy with the United States that no just interpretation of the St. Ildefonso treaty and of its resultant Louisiana Purchase treaty would include any part of West Florida in the Louisiana retroceded to France and sold by the nation to the United States.\" The governor of West Florida, Vizente Folch and his superior, the governor of Cuba, [Marqués de]Someruelos, both informed the governor of Louisiana, Juan Manuel de Salcedo, that Spain retroceded to France exactly the territory that it had received forty years before. Therefore Louisiana did not include West Florida, which Spain had acquired from Great Britain. \n\nThe clause in Article III of the St. Ildefonso treaty, \"the 'extent that it now has in the hands of Spain' did not mean to include West Florida, for the latter was separate from Louisiana in the Spanish mind; and in governmental ordinances and treaties the Floridas are always specified as distinct from Louisiana, Cuba and other Spanish possessions. 'And that it had when France possessed it.' When France possessed it between 1763 and 1769, ... it did not include West Florida. 'And such as it should be after the treaties subsequently entered into between Spain and the other States.' Spain entered into no treaty with other States relative to Louisiana until she ceded it back to France in 1800. … The Louisiana ceded to Spain by France, and retroceded by Spain to France, did not extend to the Perdido river. The only territory east of the Mississippi river included in the Louisiana transferred and retransferred, was … the Island of Orleans.\" \n\n\"No better argument can be made to support this statement than the unanswerable letter by Talleyrand\" of November 8, 1804, in reply to Monroe: \n\nFrance, in giving up Louisiana to the United States, transferred to them all the rights over that territory which she had acquired from Spain. She could not nor did she wish to cede any other; and that no room might be left for doubt in this respect, she repeated in her treaty of 30th of April, 1803, the literal expression of the treaty of St. Ildefonso, by which she had acquired that colony two years before. Nor was it stipulated in her treaty of the year 1801 that the acquisition of Louisiana by France was a retrocession; that is to say that Spain restored to France what she had received from her in 1762. … [T]he same day France ceded to England by the preliminaries of peace, all the territory to the eastward. Of this Spain received no part and could therefore give back none to France. All … bears the name of Florida. It has been constantly designated in that way during the time that Spain held it. It bears the same name in the treaties of limits between Spain and the United States; and in different notes of Mr. Livingston of a later date than the treaty of retrocession in which the name of Louisiana is given to the territory on the west side of the Mississippi; of Florida to that on the east side of it. … [Y]ou must think as unnatural, after all the changes of sovereignty which that part of America has undergone, to give the name of Louisiana to the Mobile district as to territory more north of it, on the same bank of the river, which formerly belonged to France. These observations, sir, will be sufficient to dispel every kind of doubt with regard to the extent of the retrocession made by Spain to France. … It was under this impression that the Spanish and French Plenipotentiaries negotiated. … [During] the whole course of these negotiations, the Spanish government has constantly refused to cede any part of the Floridas. … [M]oreover, … Gen. Bournouville was charged to open a new negotiation with Spain for the acquisition of the Floridas. His project which has not been followed by any treaty is an evident proof that France had not acquired by the treaty retroceding Louisiana the country east of the Mississippi. \n\nNapoleon's instructions to the French envoys at Madrid and to his General Victor-Perrin, who was to take possession of Louisiana for France, expressly followed the Treaty of 1763, and thus excluded West Florida from the cession in the treaty of St. Ildefonso. All documents relating to the [1801] transfer are to the same effect. \n\nPrevious to May, 1803, U.S. envoy Robert Livingston had contended that West Florida formed no part of Louisiana. However, the ambiguous third article of the treaty of St. Ildefonso lent itself to his purpose, although he had to adopt an interpretation that France had not asserted nor Spain allowed. Chambers arrives at what he calls the key to Mr. Livingston's sudden change of conviction concerning West Florida: \"It had been and was the desire of the United States to acquire West Florida and the Island of Orleans. [James] Monroe had assented to the purchase of Louisiana instead. If Livingston could formulate a reasonable theory upon which the United States could base a claim to West Florida the glory would be his and his alone.\" \n\nMonroe made a detailed examination of each clause of the third article. He interpreted the first clause as if Spain since 1783 had considered West Florida as part of Louisiana. The second clause only served to render the first clause clearer. The third clause referred to the treaties of 1783 and 1795, and was designed to safeguard the rights of the United States. This clause then simply gave effect to the others. \n\nAccording to Monroe, France never dismembered Louisiana while it was in her possession (as he regarded November 3, 1762, as the termination date of French possession). After 1783 Spain reunited West Florida to Louisiana, thus completing the province as France possessed it, with the exception of those portions controlled by the United States. By a strict interpretation of the treaty, therefore, Spain might be required to cede to the United States such territory west of the Perdido as once belonged to France. Secretary of State James Madison directed Livingston and Monroe \"to collect the proofs necessary to substantiate their claim to the Perdido.\" \n\nIn the autumn, 1803, Jefferson \"embodied his views in a pamphlet entitled, 'The Limits and Bounds of Louisiana.'\" Jefferson had asked some U.S. officials in the territorial border area \"to give him their views on Louisiana cartography. Daniel Clark, the best informed of them, did not believe the cession extended beyond the line laid down in the Treaty of 1763, and [William] Dunbar coincided with his view. … [William C. C.] Claiborne and John Sibley of Natchitoches were inclined to favor the claim to the Perdido, but their views were evidently determined by policy rather than precise information. The substance of their replies afforded the president little comfort.\" \n\nOn December 20, 1803, the French commissioner to Louisiana transferred New Orleans to the American commissioners, General James Wilkinson and Governor Claiborne. In January, 1804, he reiterated to Wilkinson and Claiborne that the limits on the east bank of the Mississippi remain fixed by the treaty of Paris and that Spain had peremptorily refused to include Mobile in the transfer [of 1801]. \n\nIn November, 1803, John Randolph had introduced into the House of Representatives a bill to carry into effect the laws of the United States within its new acquisition. On Feb. 24, 1804, President Jefferson signed it. Its fourth and eleventh sections gave it its popular name, \"The Mobile Act.\"\n\nWith regard to watersheds that discharge their waters to the Gulf of Mexico, the act authorized the president (1) to annex to the Mississippi revenue district all such navigable waters wholly within the United States east of the Mississippi River and (2) to place all such waters to the east of the Pascagoula River into a separate revenue district and to designate suitable ports of entry and delivery. \"These two sections placed a full legislative interpretation on the theories of Livingston, Monroe and Jefferson, and there remained only the open or tacit acquiescence of Spain to make good the title of the United States as far as the Perdido.\n\n\"In a violent personal interview which [the Spanish minister to the U.S.,] Marqués de Casa Yrujo held with him, Madison speedily learned that Spain would by no means consent to this interpretation. The incensed Spaniard demanded the annulment of these offending sections, and gave at great length the Spanish interpretation of the obscure territorial clauses. … As neither he nor Jefferson had demanded possession of the territory at the time Louisiana was transferred, the situation was an awkward one for both of them. … As Madison rendered him no adequate explanation of the administration's course, Yrujo withdrew from Washington in anger.\n\"The president then cleared the situation by his proclamation of May 30, 1804,\" in which he placed all of the waterways and shores mentioned in the Mobile Act, lying within the boundaries of the United States, in a separate revenue district, with Fort Stoddert as its port of entry and delivery. Fort Stoddert had been built in 1799 in the Mississippi Territory to the north of Mobile and West Florida. Thus Jefferson virtually annulled the act. According to the British minister to Washington, this course was \"perfectly satisfactory\" to Casa Yrujo, who nevertheless \"continued to harp upon it as a characteristic example of American duplicity.\" \n\nJefferson \"had evidently permitted Congress to pass the act in order to test Spanish resistance to [the U.S.] claim. When this proved unexpectedly strong, he wavered … and, by implication, threw upon Randolph the major part of the blame for the unfortunate legislation.\" The testy Ways and Means Committee chairman did not forget the affront. \n\nIn 1804, Madison assigned a special mission to Monroe, which had as one of the administration's objects to \"perfect its title to West Florida,\" with the right to the Perdido being a \"sine qua non\". Cox states, \"With this statement we may conclude the American position in regard to West Florida. Political, commercial, and strategic motives, as well as personal views, led Livingston, Monroe, Madison, and Jefferson to insist upon including it in the Louisiana Purchase. West Florida was necessary for the defence of New Orleans and the navigation of the Mobile. It had been desired for more than twenty years. Its acquisition formed the main purpose of Monroe's special mission.\" \n\nMonroe \"sought, but in vain, the influence of the French government in favor of [the U.S.] construction of the treaty, and [also] to help in the acquisition of territory east of the Perdido River.\" In response to the Americans' appeal as well as that of Spain, Napoleon sent word in the late summer of 1804 to the American government \"that the eastern limit of Louisiana was undoubtedly the Mississippi, the Iberville and the lakes, as laid down in the treaty of 1762; and that the double cession since afforded no basis for a more extensive claim.\" \n\nIn October, 1804, Monroe reached Paris from London on his way to Madrid. \"Monroe desired to remind Talleyrand [in a letter] of Napoleon's promise the year before to assist the United States in procuring the Floridas.\" After Monroe left for Madrid, Napoleon \"directed Talleyrand to declare the American claim to West Florida absolutely unfounded and to express a sarcastic interest in the outcome of so unusual a negotiation.\" Talleyrand's declaration on November 8, 1804 (see above), \"in connection with other previous statements did much to insure the failure of his mission.\" \n\n\"In January, 1805, Turreau and Casa Yrujo, [the French and Spanish ministers to Washington,] in an embarrassing interview with Madison, informed him that their governments had come to the joint conclusion that the American claims to West Florida were untenable…. [Turreau] even quoted the Treaty of 1762 as the determining factor in the territorial dispute. When Madison referred to maps that showed the Perdido as the eastern limit of Louisiana, Turreau pointed out that the same maps included Tennessee and Kentucky within that province. … Madison little relished this reference.\" \n\n\"Warned by the reports from abroad, the president now expected his envoys to break off the hopeless negotiations and merely attempt to secure the privilege of navigating the Mobile. Madison was ready to abandon the American claim to West Florida altogether.\" \n\nIn Madrid on May 12, 1805, Monroe and the American envoy Charles Pinckney submitted to Spain \"the ultimate conditions on which they were authorized to adjust the points depending between the two governments. … The propositions were absolutely rejected, and Mr. Monroe considering the negotiation concluded, asked and obtained his passports,\" acknowledging \"the utter failure of the mission in all its objects.\" \n\nChambers observes that, in a letter written by Jefferson in 1809 after he had left office, Madison's claim to West Florida did not impress the mind of the former president, finding Jefferson's words to be a virtual acknowledgement that the acquisition of the Floridas was a matter for future consideration, and that neither one of the Floridas had come into possession of the United States by the Louisiana Purchase. \n\nChambers also explains how, \"when the United States purchased Louisiana, it acquired a vitiated title, which, if Spain had been at the zenith of her power, would never have been made good.\" Chambers concludes, \"But for the successful revolt of the West Floridians in 1810, … the title to West Florida would have been an open question until 1819. As it was, the treaty making cession of Florida to the United States specified East and West Florida.\" \n\nIn 1813, the United States seized the land between the East Pearl River and the Perdido River. Although James Wilkinson was being paid about $4000 a year by the Spanish government, he nonetheless led the United States Army unit that carried out this seizure, the only permanent territorial acquisition during the War of 1812. On September 12-15, 1814, the Royal Navy, the Royal Marines, and Muscogees, attacked Mobile Point in the First Battle of Fort Bowyer; the HMS \"Hermes\" ran aground during the unsuccessful bombardment and was burned by the British. On February 8, 1815, in the Second Battle of Fort Bowyer, the Royal Navy landed soldiers who successfully set up cannons, howitzers, mortars, and Congreve rocket launchers, and the fort was surrendered on February 12. However, on February 13, HMS \"Brazen\" arrived, with news of the Treaty of Ghent. \n\nOn July 17, 1821, Colonel José María Callava, the Spanish governor of West Florida, formally delivered West Florida to United States General Andrew Jackson.\n\n"}

His daughters Xóchitl Hamada and Ayako Hamada are professional wrestlers.\n\nHe was one of the first dojo trainees at New Japan Pro Wrestling, being known as \"Little Hamada\" in the beginning. He was sent to Mexico's Universal Wrestling Association because of his lack of size, and he found a lot of success there - so much so that Mexican fans and promoters began calling him \"Gran Hamada\" (Great Hamada). He also competed in Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre, which added El (The) to the front of his name: El Gran Hamada.\n\nIn 1984 he became a member of the initial roster of the original Japanese UWF, but found that his flamboyantly acrobatic style clashed with the martial arts-inspired style and focus on realism of the UWF, and soon left for All Japan Pro Wrestling. He eventually broke off from AJPW to form his own promotion in 1990: Universal Lucha Libre. However, wrestlers began to leave the group in 1993, and in 1995 Hamada closed the promotion to join Michinoku Pro, which had been formed by former Universal Lucha Libre wrestlers. On April 13, 1997, Hamada teamed with Great Sasuke and Masato Yakushiji (who substituted for Gran Naniwa, who was injured) to defeat Taka Michinoku, Dick Togo and Mens Teioh (aka \"Terry Boy\") at ECW Barely Legal.\n\nIn 2001 he began competing for All Japan again, this time as a free agent. He briefly was part of the \"Love Machines\" stable under a mask as \"Mini Love Machine\" with \"Super Love Machine\" (Junji Hirata of New Japan, reprising his old role as \"Super Strong Machine\") and \"Love Machine Storm\" (Arashi, whose stage name literally means \"storm\"). They used Morning Musume's hit song \"Love Machine\" as their entrance theme. He would also briefly work for New Japan Pro Wrestling's Wrestle Land brand as Makai Masked Hurricane but only wrestled two shows under that name.\n\nHis daughters Xochitl and Ayako, who are half-Mexican, are also professional wrestlers.\n\n"}

They were considered heretical by the Catholic Church. They were initially concerned with remedying social grievances, but they became linked with the Donatist sect. They condemned property and slavery, and advocated free love, canceling debt, and freeing slaves. Donatists prized martyrdom and had a special devotion for the martyrs, rendering honours to their graves.\n\nThe term \"Circumcellions\" was coined by others, based on \"circum cellas euntes\", \"they go around larders\", because \"they roved about among the peasants, living on those they sought to indoctrinate.\"\n\nThe Circumcellions regarded martyrdom as the true Christian virtue (as the early Church Father Tertullian said, \"a martyr's death day was actually his birthday\"), and thus disagreed with the Episcopal see of Carthage on the primacy of chastity, sobriety, humility, and charity. Instead, they focused on bringing about their own martyrdom.\n\nOn occasion, members of this group assaulted Roman legionaries or armed travelers with simple wooden clubs to provoke them into attacking and martyring them. Others interrupted courts of law and verbally provoked the judge so that he would order their immediate execution (a normal punishment at the time for contempt of court).\n\nBecause it is written in the Gospel of John that Jesus had told Peter to put down his sword in the Garden of Gethsemane (), the Circumcellions avoided bladed weapons and used clubs, which they called \"Israelites\". Using their \"Israelites\", the Circumcellions would attack random travelers on the road, while shouting \"\"Laudate Deum!\"\" (\"Praise God!\" in Latin). The object of these random beatings was to provoke the victim to kill them, thereby becoming \"martyrs\".\n\nThey preferred to be known as \"agonistici\" (\"fighters (for Christ)\"). \"Agonistici\" are not to be confused with agnostics: the first term is based on \"agon\", the second on \"gnosis\".\n\n"}

The all-wooden building was quickly consumed, and only two statues made by Mohamed Hassan survived.\n\nAfter the original opera house was destroyed, Cairo was without an opera house for nearly two decades until the opening of the new Cairo Opera House in 1988.\n\nThe site of the Khedivial Opera House has been rebuilt into a multi-story concrete car garage.

It is about 30 miles (50 km) south-west of Central London. The town is connected to the M3 motorway by the A331 Blackwater Valley Road. The village can be considered a slightly more developed twin of Frimley Green. Frimley became an urban district in 1894, and was renamed Frimley and Camberley in 1929.\n\nThe name \"Frimley\" is derived from the Saxon name \"Fremma's Lea\", which means \"Fremma's clearing\". The land was owned by Chertsey Abbey from 673 to 1537 and was a farming village. More recently it was a coach stop on a Portsmouth and popular Southampton road for about four hundred years.\n\nFrimley was not listed in Domesday Book of 1086, but is shown on the map as \"Fremely\", its spelling in 933 AD.\n\nFrimley Lunatic Asylum was opened in 1799; it catered for both male and female patients, and received four patients from Great Fosters, Egham. Magistrates visited in 1807 and ordered the proprietors to stop chaining the patients.\n\nAn 1811 inventory from Frimley, a Workhouse, can be seen on the Surrey County Council website.\n\nThe present St. Peter's Church was built in 1826 replacing earlier buildings. The building has a balcony running around three sides of the interior. Dame Ethel Smyth once preached from the pulpit.\n\nIn 1904, the Brompton Hospital Sanatorium was established in Frimley to treat tuberculosis patients; it closed in 1985. Dr Marcus Sinclair Paterson (1870–1932) was the first medical superintendent, and he developed a system of treatment called 'graduated labour' which generated a lot of interest from other health professionals. The treatment used controlled levels of physical activity.\n\nIn 1931 the staff at Frimley Cottage Hospital were unable to save the life of Lieutenant Hubert Chevis, who had been admitted, along with his wife Frances, after eating poisoned partridge meat. He died of strychnine poisoning. The case remains an unsolved murder mystery.\n\nIn 1959 the Cadet Training Centre at Frimley Park was formed following the 1957 publication of the Amery Report.\n\nThe main shopping street includes a branch of Waitrose and some smaller shops, several restaurants, charity shops, a post office, a number of estate agents, solicitors, opticians, betting shops, an insurance broker and two public houses, the Railway Arms and the White Hart. Frimley Park Hospital is within the boundaries. One of the major employers in the town is BAE Systems, which occupies a building off Lyon Way. Siemens opened its main UK headquarters in Frimley in 2007.\n\nFrimley Business Park is to the west on a north-south road, the A331. It has offices of the Environment Agency, Genesys Telecommunications, AMD and Novartis Pharmaceuticals.\nThe usual number of residents in the ward, 6,178, belies the observation that this is the largest and most commercial settlement of the GU16 postcode which also covers the southernmost, Heatherside/Parkside, neighbourhoods Camberley of (its post town) and the distinct villages of Frimley Green, Mytchett and Deepcut.\n\nThe working population worked as set out below in the official industry categorisations in 2011:\n\nThe ward is relatively representative of the nation as a whole in terms of national identity:\nThe proportions of those retired, unemployed and who were students in 2011 were extremely close to the regional average whereas those in the economically inactive (other) category were fewer:\nThose who replied that again there were no people in the household with English as their main language formed a proportion of the population 0.1% less than the national average.\n\nFrimley railway station provides access to Guildford, Ascot and London Waterloo. Frimley Lodge Park Railway (a tourist attraction) is also nearby.\n\nThe town is situated close to the junction of the A325 Farnborough Road and A331 Blackwater Valley Relief Road, which provides a link to the M3 Motorway junction 4.\n\nThere are a number of schools in Frimley including: The Grove Primary School, Lakeside Primary School, Ravenscote Junior School, Tomlinscote School and St Augustine's RC Primary School.\n\nFrimley Town Football Club was formed over 100 years ago. It runs four teams, and the first team competes in the Senior Division of the Aldershot & District Football League. The club is based at Chobham Road recreation ground.\n\nFrimley Green, a neighbouring village, has hosted the British Darts Organisation's (BDO) World Professional Darts Championship since 1986 each January in the Lakeside complex.\n\n\nDaphne du Maurier wrote most of her fourth novel, Jamaica Inn, in 1935 in Frimley where her soldier husband Frederick (Boy) Browning was based.\n\nDame Ethel Smyth, English composer and suffragette grew up in nearby Frimley Green and later purchased One Oak Cottage in Frimley. Her family moved to Frimley Green in 1867 when her father was given command of the Royal Artillery at Aldershot.\n\nNotable people buried in the churchyard of St. Peter's Church, Frimley include:\n\nIn one of the \"Just William\" books by Richmal Crompton, William visits an aunt in Frimley for a few days.\n\nCharles Kingsley refers to \"\"a series of letters on the Frimley murder\"\" in his \"Alton Locke, Tailor and Poet\".\n\nThere is a brief mention of Frimley in Stephen King's \"Nightmares & Dreamscapes\" in the short story \"Crouch End\". It reads: 'He did indeed move into council housing, a two-above-the-shops in Frimley'.\n\nIn \"The Reminiscences of Sir Henry Hawkins (Baron Brampton)\", chapter 18 tells of the trial of a bricklayer who, in a prize fight on Frimley Common, unfortunately killed his opponent. He appeared in court dressed as a young clergyman and was found innocent of the manslaughter charge because of doubts over his identity.\n"}

{"id": "2100829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100829", "title": "Bass Strait Triangle", "text": "Bass Strait Triangle\n\nThe Bass Strait Triangle is the waters that separate the states of Victoria and Tasmania, including Bass Strait, in south-eastern Australia. The term \"Bass Strait Triangle\" (inspired by the Bermuda Triangle) appears to have been first used following the Valentich Disappearance in 1978 although the region had a bad reputation (never ascribed to supernatural forces, however) long before that.\n\nBass Strait is a generally shallow (average depth of ) stretch of water approximately wide and from north to south, encompassed by the entire northern coastline of Tasmania and Victoria's central to eastern coast. The prevailing winds and currents are westerly, the latter being divided by King Island, Tasmania at the western entrance to the strait, causing unpredictable sea conditions, especially when strong winds occur. For example, strong southerly winds can cause a strong northerly current reflecting from the Victorian coast. The combination of winds, currents, tidal flow and the shallow bottom often lead to tall waves, often of short length, with a confused short swell often conflicting in direction.\n\nAll shipping to the busy ports of Melbourne, Stanley, Burnie, Devonport, Bell Bay and Launceston and the Bass Strait islands such as King Island and Flinders Island must pass through Bass Strait, and it is also the route of choice for many ships passing from the Australian west to east coasts. Most air traffic between Tasmania and the Australian mainland flies at least in part over or adjacent to it.\n\nBass Strait was discovered following the wreck of the ship \"Sydney Cove\" on the Furneaux Group in 1797 and one of the vessels engaged in the salvage operation, the sloop \"Eliza\", went missing on her return voyage to Sydney. Hundreds of vessels from small yachts and fishing craft up to the size of bulk carriers have come to grief in Bass Strait since that time through hitting reefs, running aground on the coastline or on river bars while entering port, or foundering due to stress of weather, some dozens being lost without a trace.\n\nActual north-south (and vice versa) crossing of Bass Strait seldom occurred until after Melbourne was established in 1835. From 1838-1840, at least seven vessels were lost with all hands on their way to or from the new settlement, wreckage from only three being identified. Rumours that some of these vessels had fallen victim to wreckers appear baseless, the main cause probably being bad weather and poor charts. One of the most significant later disappearances was that of the British warship in 1858, in which well over one hundred lives were lost, and no positively identifiable wreckage located. \n\nThe first aircraft to go missing in Bass Strait was a military Airco DH.9A that was engaged in a search for the missing schooner \"Amelia J\" in 1920 — it was believed to have gone into the sea off the southern coast of Flinders Island. \n\nOne of the first Bass Strait airliners, the De Havilland Express \"Miss Hobart\", went missing soon after entering service in 1934, only a small amount of wreckage being found on the Victorian coast. A year later, a similar aircraft was lost with all on board off Flinders Island. The cause of both accidents was probably a combination of human error with the known poor design of the aircraft.\n\nDuring the Second World War, several aircraft — mostly RAAF Bristol Beaufort bombers — were lost during exercises in Bass Strait while on training flights out of air bases, mainly RAAF Base East Sale near Sale, Victoria. These accidents were probably caused by the inexperienced crew crashing into the sea while performing low-level bombing practice — similar accidents occurred over land. \n\nIn 1972, a De Havilland Tiger Moth flown by Brenda Hean and Max Price disappeared on a flight from Tasmania to Canberra as part of protests against the flooding of Lake Pedder for a hydroelectricity scheme. It was believed to have crashed at sea somewhere between the East Coast and Flinders Island. Sabotage by pro-development interests was alleged.\n\nThe most famous incident, and the one that has been the inspiration for paranormal explanations, was the Valentich Disappearance in 1978.\n\n\n\n"}

During that period he served on the Indian Delegation to the United Nations, working extensively with UNESCO and UNICEF, and chairing an international anti-malaria effort. He served as Chairman of the UNICEF Executive Board from 1955 to 1956. Leaving his diplomatic career to return to academe, Rajan taught at the University of Delhi before emigrating to Canada to take up a position at the University of Western Ontario.\n\nRajan's scholarly work covered a wide range of English poetry, but returned frequently to Milton and particularly to Milton's \"Paradise Lost\". His work cannot be easily assigned to any critical methodology; he was a scholar of poetics in many forms and from many approaches. His 1947 book \"Paradise Lost and the Seventeenth Century Reader\" is primarily a response to Milton's apparent interest in Arianism, considered a heresy, and argues for a distinction between private and public meaning in Milton's poetry. The book was influential for William Empson, particularly Empson's critique of strictly theological readings of \"Paradise Lost\", \"Milton's God\". Later essays explore what Rajan calls \"generic multeity\" in \"Paradise Lost\".\n\nIn addition to his work on Milton, Rajan's later criticism addresses issues of meaning, intention, and context in a broad array of writers including Spenser, Yeats, Marvell, Keats, and Macaulay. Rajan considered 'poetry cannot report the event, it must be the event.'\n\nRajan also wrote two novels. \"The Dark Dancer\" is a sobering study of the conflicts of the Partition; \"Too Long in the West\", on the other hand, is a more light-hearted satire (perhaps influenced by Tagore's \"Farewell, My Friend\") about a girl's return to her home village after an emancipating education in New York.\n\nRajan's daughter is the scholar and literary theorist Tilottama Rajan, who also teaches at Western.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2100840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100840", "title": "Tithe War", "text": "Tithe War\n\nThe Tithe War () was a campaign of mainly nonviolent civil disobedience, punctuated by sporadic violent episodes, in Ireland between 1830 and 1836 in reaction to the enforcement of tithes on the Roman Catholic majority for the upkeep of the established state church, the Church of Ireland. Tithes were payable in cash or kind and payment was compulsory, irrespective of an individual's religious adherence.\n\nTithe payment was an obligation on those working the land to pay ten per cent of the value of certain types of agricultural produce for the upkeep of the clergy and maintenance of the assets of the church. After the Reformation in Ireland of the 16th century, the assets of the church were allocated by King Henry VIII to the new established church. The majority in Ireland who remained loyal to the old religion were then obliged to make tithe payments which were directed away from their own church to the reformed one. This increased the financial burden on subsistence farmers, many of whom were at the same time making voluntary contributions to the construction or purchase of new premises to provide Roman Catholic places of worship. The new established church was supported by only a minority of the population, seventy-five percent of whom continued to adhere to Roman Catholicism.\n\nEmancipation for Roman Catholics was promised by Pitt during the campaign in favour of the Act of Union of 1801 which was approved by the Irish Parliament, thus abolishing itself and creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. However, King George III refused to keep Pitt's promises. It was not until 1829 that the Duke of Wellington's government promoted and parliament enacted the Roman Catholic Emancipation Act, in the teeth of defiant royal opposition from King George IV.\n\nBut the obligation to pay tithes to the Church of Ireland remained, causing much resentment. Roman Catholic clerical establishments in Ireland had refused government offers of tithe-sharing with the established church, fearing that British government regulation and control would come with acceptance of such money.\n\nThe tithe burden lay directly on the shoulders of farmers, whether tenants or owner-occupiers. More often than not, tithes were paid in kind, in the form of produce or livestock. In 1830, given the system of benefices in the Anglican system, almost half of the clergy were not resident in the parishes from which they drew their incomes. These issues, more often than not, were inflamed by the senior Irish Roman Catholic clergy, who were now dependent on voluntary contributions due to the discontinuation of the Maynooth grant. Incensed farmers vehemently resisted paying for the support of two clerical establishments. With the involvement of many of the Roman Catholic bishops and clergy, they began a campaign of non-payment.\n\nAfter Emancipation in 1829, an organized campaign of resistance to collection began. It was sufficiently successful to have a serious financial effect on the welfare of established church clergy. In 1831, the government compiled lists of defaulters and issued collection orders for the seizure of goods and chattels (mostly stock). Spasmodic violence broke out in various parts of Ireland, particularly in counties Kilkenny, Tipperary and Wexford. The Irish Constabulary, which had been established in 1822, attempted to enforce the orders of seizures. At markets and fairs, the constabulary often seized stock and produce, which often resulted in violent resistance.\n\nA campaign of passive resistance was proposed by Patrick \"Patt\" Lalor (1781–1856), a farmer of Tenakill, Queen's County, who later served as a repeal MP (1832–35). He declared at a public meeting in February 1831 in Maryborough that \"...he would never again pay tithes; that he would violate no law; that the tithe men might take his property, and offer it for sale; but his countrymen, he was proud to say, respected him, and he thought that none of them would buy or bid for it if exposed for sale. The declaration was received by the meeting in various ways: by many with surprise and astonishment; by others with consternation and dismay, but by a vast majority with tremendous cheering.\" Lalor held true to his word and did not resist the confiscation of 20 sheep from his farm, but was able to ensure no buyers appeared at subsequent auctions.\n\nThe first clash of the Tithe War took place on 3 March 1831 in Graiguenamanagh, County Kilkenny, when a force of 120 yeomanry tried to enforce seizure orders on cattle belonging to a Roman Catholic priest. Encouraged by his bishop, he had organised people to resist tithe collection by placing their stock under his ownership prior to sale. The revolt soon spread. On 18 June 1831, in Bunclody (Newtownbarry), County Wexford, people resisting the seizure of cattle were fired upon by the Irish Constabulary, who killed twelve and wounded twenty; one yeoman was shot dead in retaliation. This massacre caused objectors to organise and use warnings such as church bells to signal the community to round up the cattle and stock. On 14 December 1831, resisters used such warnings to ambush a detachment of 40 Constabulary at Carrickshock (County Kilkenny). Twelve constables, including the Chief Constable, were killed and more wounded. (Other sources put the number of dead at eighteen.)\n\nWhat makes the Battle of Carrickshock stand out in 'social memory' is examined in the 2004 publication \"The Carrickshock Incident, 1831: Social Memory and an Irish cause célèbre\" by Gary Owens of Huron University College, in Canada. What makes Carrickshock different in impact could have a much to do with what happened nearby in Ballyhale the following year, in 1832, when a gathering of c.200,000 people assembled at Ballyhale from across four counties to support those charged in aftermath of The Battle of Carrickshock, an extraordinary number for those days before cars. They were also addressed by barrister Daniel O'Connell, also known as Liberator of the Nation. That is deemed to have had a significant influence on its overall outcome for anti-tithe movement, ensuring that the event marked the beginning of the end of tithes in Ireland. This Ballyhale event is notable too in that it was the first so-called 'monster meeting' of that time. Such peaceful gatherings were to become the hallmark of the Young Ireland and Repeal Movement that was founded in 1839 and which gatherings peaked with Daniel O'Connell's oration at Tara, 1843, where c.750,000 assembled. Michael Davitt's Museum records show that the Land League campaigns, which he co-founded in 1879, followed that path too to ensure that it enabled tenant farmers to be able to own the land on which they worked.\n\nRegular clashes causing fatalities continued over the next two years, causing the authorities to reinforce selected army barracks fearing an escalation. Taking stock of the continuing resistance, in 1831 the authorities recorded 242 homicides, 1,179 robberies, 401 burglaries, 568 burnings, 280 cases of cattle-maiming, 161 assaults, 203 riots and 723 attacks on property directly attributed to seizure order enforcement. In 1832, the president of Carlow College was imprisoned for not paying tithes.\nOn 18 December 1834, the conflict came to a head at Rathcormac, County Cork, when armed Constabulary reinforced by the regular British Army killed twelve and wounded forty-two during several hours of fighting when trying to enforce a tithe order reputedly to the value of 40 shillings.\n\nThe conflict had the support of the Roman Catholic clergy and the following quotation, from a letter written by the Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin, Dr. James Doyle to Thomas Spring Rice became the rallying cry for the movement: \n\nThere are many noble traits in the Irish character, mixed with failings which have always raised obstacles to their own well-being; but an innate love of justice, and an indomitable hatred of oppression, is like a gem upon the front of our nation which no darkness can obscure. To this fine quality I trace their hatred of tithes; may it be as lasting as their love of justice!\n\nFinding and collecting livestock chattels and the associated mayhem created public outrage and proved an increasing strain on police relations. The government suspended collections. One official lamented that \"it cost a shilling to collect tuppence\".\n\nKing William IV, the last king from the House of Hanover, died in 1837. In 1838, parliament introduced a Tithe Commutation Act for Ireland. This reduced the amount payable directly by about a quarter and made the remainder payable in rent to landlords. They in turn were to pass payment to the authorities. Tithes were thus effectively added to a tenant's rent payment. This partial relief and elimination of the confrontational collections ended the violent aspect of the Tithe War.\n\nFull relief from the tax was not achieved until the Irish Church Act 1869, which disestablished the Church of Ireland, by the Gladstone government.\n\n\n"}

It can equate to the dictionary definition of literalism: \"adherence to the exact letter or the literal sense\", where literal means \"in accordance with, involving, or being the primary or strict meaning of the word or words; not figurative or metaphorical\".\n\nAlternatively, the term can refer to the historical-grammatical method, a hermeneutic technique that strives to uncover the meaning of the text by taking into account not just the grammatical words, but also the syntactical aspects, the cultural and historical background, and the literary genre. It emphasizes the referential aspect of the words in the text without denying the relevance of literary aspects, genre, or figures of speech within the text (e.g., parable, allegory, simile, or metaphor). It does not necessarily lead to complete agreement upon one single interpretation of any given passage. This Christian fundamentalist and evangelical hermeneutical approach to scripture is used extensively by fundamentalist Christians, in contrast to the historical-critical method of mainstream Judaism or Mainline Protestantism. Those who relate biblical literalism to the historical-grammatical method use the word \"letterism\" to cover interpreting the Bible according to the dictionary definition of literalism.\n\nFundamentalists and evangelicals sometimes refer to themselves as literalists or biblical literalists. Sociologists also use the term in reference to conservative Christian beliefs which include not just literalism but also biblical inerrancy. The term \"biblical literalism\" is often used as a pejorative to describe or ridicule the interpretative approaches of fundamentalist or evangelical Christians.\n\nA 2011 Gallup survey reports, \"Three in 10 Americans interpret the Bible literally, saying it is the actual word of God. That is similar to what Gallup has measured over the last two decades, but down from the 1970s and 1980s. A 49% plurality of Americans say the Bible is the inspired word of God but that it should not be taken literally, consistently the most common view in Gallup's nearly 40-year history of this question. Another 17% consider the Bible an ancient book of stories recorded by man.\"\n\nThe high regard for religious scriptures in the Judeo-Christian tradition seems to relate in part to a process of canonization of the Hebrew Bible which occurred over the course of a few centuries from approximately 200 BCE to 200 CE. In the Jewish tradition, the highly regarded written word represented a direct conduit to the mind of God, and the later rabbinical school of Judaism encouraged the attendant scholarship that accompanied a literary religion. Similarly, the canonization of the New Testament by the Early Christian Church became an important aspect in the formation of the separate religious identity for Christianity. Ecclesiastical authorities used the acceptance or rejection of specific scriptural books as a major indicator of group identity, and it played a role in the determination of excommunications in Christianity and in \"cherem\" in the Jewish tradition.\n\nChurch father Origen (184-253 CE), due to his familiarity with reading and interpreting Hellenistic literature, taught that some parts of the Bible ought to be interpreted non-literally. Concerning the Genesis account of creation, he wrote: \"who is so silly as to believe that God ... planted a paradise eastward in Eden, and set in it a visible and palpable tree of life ... [and] anyone who tasted its fruit with his bodily teeth would gain life?\" He also believed that such hermeneutics should be applied to the gospel accounts as well.\nChurch father Augustine of Hippo (354–430 CE) wrote of the need for reason in interpreting Jewish and Christian scripture, and of much of the Book of Genesis being an extended metaphor. But Augustine also implicitly accepted the literalism of the creation of Adam and Eve, and explicitly accepted the literalism of the virginity of Jesus's mother Mary.\n\nIn the Reformation, Martin Luther (1483–1546 CE) separated the biblical apocrypha from the rest of the Old Testament books in his Bible, reflecting scholarly doubts that had continued for centuries, and the Westminster Confession of 1646 demoted them to a status that denied their canonicity. American Protestant literalists and biblical inerrantists have adopted this smaller Protestant Bible as a work not merely inspired by God but, in fact, representing the Word of God without possibility of error or contradiction.\n\nBiblical literalism first became an issue in the 18th century, enough so for Diderot to mention it in his \"Encyclopédie\". Karen Armstrong sees \"[p]reoccupation with literal truth\" as \"a product of the scientific revolution\".\n\nThe vast majority of evangelical and fundamentalist Christians regard the Biblical text as clear, and believe that the average person may understand the basic meaning and teachings of the Bible. Such Christians often refer to the teachings of the Bible rather than to the process of interpretation itself. The doctrine of clarity of the text does not mean that no interpretative principles are necessary, or that there is no gap between the culture in which the Bible was written and the culture of a modern reader. On the contrary, exegetical and interpretative principles come into play as part of the process of closing that cultural gap. The doctrine does deny that the Bible is a code to decipher, or that understanding it requires complex academic analysis as is typical in the historical-critical method of interpretation.\nBiblical literalists believe that, unless a passage is clearly intended by the writer as allegory, poetry, or some other genre, the Bible should be interpreted as literal statements by the author. Critics argue that allegorical intent can be ambiguous. Fundamentalists typically treat as simple history, according to its plain sense, passages such as those that recount the Genesis creation, the deluge and Noah's ark, and the unnaturally long life-spans of the patriarchs given in genealogies of Genesis, as well as the strict historicity of the narrative accounts of Ancient Israel, the supernatural interventions of God in history, and Jesus' miracles. Literalism does not deny that parables, metaphors and allegory exist in the Bible, but rather relies on contextual interpretations based on apparent authorial intention.\n\nAs a part of the \"Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy,\"\nconservative Christian scholarship affirms the following:\n\nSteve Falkenberg, professor of religious psychology at Eastern Kentucky University, observed: \n\nConrad Hyers, professor of comparative religion at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota, criticizes biblical literalism as a mentality that \n\nRobert Cargill responded to viewers' questions on a History Channel series explaining why academic scholarship rejects forms of biblical literalism: \n\nChristian Smith wrote in his 2012 book, \"The Bible Made Impossible: Why Biblicism Is Not a Truly Evangelical Reading of Scripture\":\n\n"}

There is general agreement worldwide on what clothing is suitable, but local jurisdictions have specific rules and recommendations.\n\nThe helmet offers some protection for the user's head against impact by the cutter bar of the chainsaw should a 'kickback' occur. Kickback is when the running chainsaw jumps up unexpectedly out of the cut, thus endangering the saw operator. \nHelmet protection can only be successful if the chain brake has been operated to stop the saw chain, since a chain running at full speed can easily cut into the helmet. The helmet, and its eye protection guard, also protect against impacts from small falling or flying objects, such as dead twigs and branches from a tree being felled.\n\nExposure to the sun causes the plastic of the helmet to weaken over time, so it is recommended that a helmet is replaced every 3–5 years. A helmet normally has a symbol inside that shows when it was made. Many helmets also now have a sticker on the outside that fades with exposure to light. When the sticker has faded the helmet should be replaced. \nAnother way of determining if a helmet needs to be changed is to press the two sides of the helmet towards each other. If a cracking noise is heard, the helmet must be replaced.\n\nIn the EU, a helmet must meet the requirements of EN397. Helmets as well as other safety equipment in Germany must have the KWF sign.\n\nA visor or goggles reduce the chance of chips penetrating the user's eyes.\n\nThe relatively flimsy mesh visor, with imperfect coverage of the face, is considered acceptable because the chips produced by well-maintained chainsaws are of relatively uniform size and speed. Unlike other woodworking tools, a chainsaw with a sharp chain produces little or no sawdust, only chips (that are too large to fit through the visor's mesh).\n\nSome chainsaw users prefer conventional safety glasses or goggles. The choice may depend on the environment. The visor provides better ventilation for hard work in hot weather. Often, both safety goggles and a visor are employed for superior protection.\n\nIn the EU, a visor must comply with EN1731, or glasses must comply with EN166.\n\nA leather mitt for the operator's left hand that is fitted to (but is free to rotate on) the front bar of the chainsaw.\n\nThe safety mitt ensures that if kickback occurs the operator's hand remains on the bar of the chainsaw. This means that the kickback is more easily controlled and the chain brake is more easily engaged. The safety mitt also protects the operator's left hand in the same way as chainsaw safety gloves. The protection on the left hand mitt protects when the chain derails and jumps over the front handle.\n\nMost safety mitts have a protection class 0 (up to 16 m/s chain speed, see below). There are mitts available covering class 1 (20 m/s chain speed).\n\nEar defenders and ear plugs attenuate noise to levels that cause little or no damage to the user's hearing. Non-electric chainsaws are very loud, typically 115 dB, above the recommended exposure limit of 85 dB from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.\n\nIn the EU, ear defenders must comply with EN352-1.\n\nSpecial fabrics have been developed for chainsaw clothing, and this development is still ongoing. Conventional fabric is useless as protection against a running chainsaw, as the fabric is cut through immediately.\n\nThere is a real struggle and conflict between making a fabric proof against more violent impact, and making it light, flexible and comfortable enough for the user. Clothes which make the user too hot, or which prevent the user moving easily, are a safety problem in themselves. A worker unable to move easily and/or suffering from being too hot is not safe. \nExtra fabric layers are added to clothing to improve cut resistance, but clothes which cannot be cut at all by a powerful saw are impractical, even with modern fibres. \nAdditionally saw and chain technology seems to be outstripping fabric technology. \nIt is almost impossible to protect against high power saws employing aggressive cutting chains.\n\nA classification scheme has been developed in the EU to rate trousers, and fabric in general, for protection against cutting.\n\nThe chain speed is specified in the manual for a chainsaw. Higher class trousers are more expensive, hotter, and heavier, so there is an advantage to choosing the trousers to match the saw.\n\nThere are two standard types of trousers, type A and type C. Type A protects only the front of the legs, and can be supplied as chaps, worn over conventional work clothes, or as conventional trousers. Type C gives protection all around the legs and are almost always worn as ordinary trousers, not over another garment. Chaps are generally used for occasional, farm or homeowner applications. Professional chainsaw operators would choose trousers for comfort and ease of movement, with fallers, ground workers and firewood cutters opting for class A trousers because of the low risk of being cut in the back of the leg. Climbers and tree surgeons would have to wear type C, as they will be cutting from a wider variety of positions. Type C trousers are, of course, highly insulating, and may lead to heat stress if worn for labour-intensive operations such as firewood cutting. \nChainsaw protective fabric works on a number of principles. The outermost layer can be made both tough and slippery, to protect against minor damage which could compromise the filler material. Beneath this, long, loose fibres of polyester, Avertic, ballistic nylon or Kevlar are laid in layers. When a saw contacts the trousers, the outer layer is immediately cut through but the inner is drawn out and wraps around the saw's drive sprocket, locking it solid and halting the chain, limiting damage to the operator's leg. The length of the fabrics and number of layers match the safety class. In case of an accident the fabric is pulled out of the upper and lower seam and wrap around the sprocket as described above. Protection is only given for gas [i.e.petrol] chain saws, not for electrical saws. Trousers should be slightly baggy, so that there is give, to prevent the chain pulling the operator's leg into the chainsaw. Instead the 'baggy' excess fabric is pulled out and into the chain mechanism, thereby stopping the saw. After stopping a saw, the damaged trousers must be scrapped, having done their job. \nThe saw must be field-stripped to remove the fibres, and to allow it to run again.\n\nIf some trousers are washed the material inside may degrade over time. As a result, these trousers should be replaced, and not washed in hot water too frequently. If the trousers have Avertic as protection, they should be washed regularly to maintain its protective features. Likewise trousers should be free of rips and tears that may catch on a chain saw or timber when moving through a forest.\n\nIn case the trousers are damaged it is permissible to repair them only as long the inside protective fabric layers are not damaged. If they are damaged the trousers are no longer safe.\nThey must be thrown away and a new pair obtained.\n\nChainsaw protective trousers in the EU must comply with EN381-5.\n\nChainsaw protective jackets in the EU must comply with EN381-11.\n\nFor detailed information on fabric ratings, see the section above on trousers. The logic is much the same - the protective materials are designed to slow the chain's rate of cutting and clog the mechanism, rather than protect the wearer completely.\n\nChainsaw gloves have cut-proof fabric protection like that for trousers, but only on the back of the left hand. It's especially important that work gloves are flexible, which limits how much padding they can have. Experience has shown that most chainsaw injuries to the hands occur on the back of the left hand.\n\nIn the EU, chainsaw gloves must comply with EN381-7.\n\nChainsaw boots are based on ordinary steel-toe boots, but have layers of chainsaw protective fabric on the exposed front surfaces. They are available in lace-up leather or rubber wellington boot versions. Popular manufacturers of chainsaw boots sold in Europe include Haix, Klima-Air, Rock Fall, Meindl and Oregon.\n\nBoots protect the operator from front and, to a certain extent, from sideways cuts.\n\nIn the EU, chainsaw boots must comply with EN345-2. These boots must be to the appropriate EN20345 standard for general safety footwear and must also be distinctively marked as suitable for chainsaw use, according to EN381-3\n\nProtective chainsaw gaiters to EN381-9 over general steel-toe boots are acceptable for occasional users.\n\nIn the early 1980s Kjell Eng, the founder of Engtex, got the idea to use textiles for protection and cut prevention. Having worked as a logger earlier in life, he was very aware of the danger in using and handling a chainsaw. The first generation of protective fabrics consisted of a multi-layered and specially designed tricot fabric that peeled off layer by layer at contact with the cutting chains. This was the start and the first-ever chainsaw protective fabric was born. Statistics showed a reduction in injuries at work-related accidents in forestry and logging. However the new fabrics did not stop the more severe accidents with deep cuts and lethal outcome.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Kjell Eng introduced the second generation of chainsaw protection and Engtex was granted its first patent in 1989.\n\nDevelopment of a third generation protective fabrics started in 1992 under the name Avertic. By using a new combination of settings, materials and finishing, this new generation of protective textiles enhanced not only the washability of garments but also the level of protection compared to earlier generations. Thanks to Kjell Eng´s innovative mind, Avertic chainsaw protective textiles are still used in chaps, trousers, boots, jackets and gloves around the world. In the spirit of Kjell Eng the manufacturers of PPE strive daily to invent better protection for workers in the forestry and logging industry.\n\nIn the EU, chainsaw trousers, boots and gloves (the items containing chainsaw protective fabric) must carry a special chainsaw logo. This shows that the fabric is of a type tested to protect properly, and also shows the class of protection, the rated maximum chain speed.\n\nIn the UK and Germany, workers are required to carry a first aid kit containing at least a large wound dressing.\n\nIn the UK, workers are recommended to carry a whistle to call for help if they are injured. Colleagues may be close by, but unable to hear shouts for help over the noise of a running chainsaw.\n\nIn Germany a \"\"Hilfe im Wald\"\" (\"Help in the forest\") app shows the next security point where ambulances have access. These safety points are numbered and visible by a pole with orange head and the number on. These numbers are known to ambulances.\n\n\n"}

In this context, aggression is defined as initiating or threatening any forceful interference with an individual or their property. In contrast to pacifism, it does not forbid forceful defense.\n\nThe NAP is considered by some to be a defining principle of libertarianism in the United States. It is also a prominent idea in anarcho-capitalism, classical liberalism and minarchism.\nThe non-aggression principle has existed in various forms. A number of authors have created their own formulation of the harm principle which NAP supporters argue as a form of non-aggression principle as shown in the table below.\n\nThe principle has been derived by various philosophical approaches, including:\n\nBoth supporters and opponents of abortion rights amongst right-libertarians justify their position on NAP grounds. One important question to determine whether or not abortion is consistent with NAP is at what stage of development a fertilized human egg cell can be considered a human being with the status and rights attributed to personhood. Some supporters of NAP argue this occurs at the moment of conception. Others argue that since they believe the fetus lacks sentience until a certain stage of development, it does not qualify as a human being, and as such may be considered property of the mother. Opponents of abortion, on the other hand, state sentience is not a qualifying factor. They refer to the animal rights discussion and point out the \"Argument from marginal cases\" that concludes NAP also applies to non-sentient (i.e. mentally handicapped) humans.\n\nAnother important question is whether an unwelcome fetus should be considered to be an unauthorized trespasser in its mother's body. The non-aggression principle does not protect trespassers from the owners of the property on which they are trespassing. It can also be argued that unwelcome fetuses are themselves committing aggression against their mothers, by taking materials (oxygen, water, nutrients) from her bloodstream, by injecting toxic metabolic end-products (carbon dioxide and creatinine) into her bloodstream, and by preparing to subject her to major medical/surgical trauma in the form of full-term labor and delivery.\n\nObjectivist philosopher Leonard Peikoff has argued that a fetus has no right to life inside the womb because it is not an \"independently existing, biologically formed organism, let alone a person.\" Pro-choice libertarian Murray Rothbard held the same stance, maintaining that abortion is justified at any time during pregnancy if the fetus is no longer welcome inside its mother. Likewise, other pro-choice supporters base their argument on criminal trespass. In that case, they claim, NAP is not violated when the fetus is forcibly removed, with deadly force if need be, from the mother's body, just as NAP is not violated when an owner removes from the owner's property an unwanted visitor who is not willing to leave voluntarily. Libertarian theorist Walter Block follows this line of argument but makes a distinction between evicting the fetus prematurely so that it dies and actively killing it (see \"Libertarian perspectives on abortion\").\n\nPro-life libertarians, however, argue that because the parents were actively involved in creating a new human life and that life has not consented to his or her own existence, that life is in the womb by necessity and no parasitism or trespassing is involved (see also legal necessity). They state that as the parents are responsible for that life's position, NAP would be violated when that life is killed with abortive techniques.\n\nNAP is defined as applicable to any unauthorized actions towards a person's \"physical\" property. Supporters of NAP disagree on whether it should apply to intellectual property (IP) rights as well as physical property rights. Some argue that because intellectual concepts are non-rivalrous, intellectual property rights are unnecessary. while others argue that intellectual property rights are as valid and important as physical ones.\n\nThough NAP is meant to guarantee an individual's sovereignty, libertarians greatly differ on the conditions under which NAP applies. Especially unsolicited intervention by others, either to prevent society from being harmed by the individual's actions or to prevent an incompetent individual from being harmed by his own (in)actions, is an important issue. The debate centers on topics like the age of consent for children, intervention counseling (i.e. for addicted persons, or in case of domestic violence), involuntary commitment and involuntary treatment with regards to mental illness, medical assistance (i.e. prolonged life support vs euthanasia in general and for the senile or comatose in particular), human organ trade, state paternalism (including economic intervention) and foreign intervention by states. Other discussion topics on whether intervention is in line with NAP include nuclear weapons proliferation, and human trafficking and (illegal) immigration.\n\nSome libertarians justify the existence of a minimal state on the grounds that anarcho-capitalism implies that the non-aggression principle is optional because the enforcement of laws is open to competition. They claim competing law enforcement would always result in war and the rule of the most powerful.\n\nAnarcho-capitalists usually respond to this argument that this presumed outcome of coercive competition (e.g. PMCs or PDAs that enforce local law) is not likely because of the very high cost, in lives and economically, of war. They claim that war drains those involved and leaves non-combatant parties as the most powerful, economically and militarily, ready to take over. Therefore, anarcho-capitalists claim that in practice, and in more advanced societies with large institutions that have a responsibility to protect their vested interests, disputes are most likely to be settled peacefully. Anarcho-capitalists also point out that a state monopoly of law enforcement does not necessarily make NAP present throughout society as corruption and corporatism, as well as lobby group clientelism in democracies, favor only certain people or organizations. Anarcho-capitalists aligned with the Rothbardian philosophy generally contend that the state violates the non-aggression principle by its very nature because, it is argued, governments necessarily use force against those who have not stolen private property, vandalized private property, assaulted anyone, or committed fraud.\n\nSome proponents of the NAP see taxes as a violation of NAP, while critics of the NAP argue that because of the free-rider problem in case security is a public good, enough funds would not be obtainable by voluntary means to protect individuals from aggression of a greater severity. The latter therefore accept taxation, and consequently a breach of NAP with regard to any free-riders, as long as no more is levied than is necessary to optimise protection of individuals against aggression. Geolibertarians, who following the classical economists and Georgists adhere to the Lockean labor theory of property, argue that land value taxation is fully compatible with the NAP.\n\nAnarcho-capitalists argue that the protection of individuals against aggression is self-sustaining like any other valuable service, and that it can be supplied without coercion by the free market much more effectively and efficiently than by a government monopoly. Their approach, based on proportionality in justice and damage compensation, argues that full restitution is compatible with both retributivism and a utilitarian degree of deterrence while consistently maintaining NAP in a society. They extend their argument to all public goods and services traditionally funded through taxation, like security offered by dikes.\n\nSupporters of the NAP often appeal to it in order to argue for the immorality of theft, vandalism, assault, and fraud. Compared to nonviolence, the non-aggression principle does not preclude violence used in self-defense or defense of others. Many supporters argue that NAP opposes such policies as victimless crime laws, taxation, and military drafts. NAP is the foundation of libertarian philosophy.\n\nNAP faces two kinds of criticism: the first holds that the principle is immoral, and the second argues that it is impossible to apply consistently in practice; respectively, consequentialist or deontological criticisms, and inconsistency criticisms. Libertarian academic philosophers have noted the implausible results consistently applying the principle yields: for example, Professor Matt Zwolinski notes that, because pollution necessarily violates the NAP by encroaching (even if slightly) on other people's property, consistently applying the NAP would prohibit driving, starting a fire, and other activities necessary to the maintenance of industrial society.\n\nCritics argue that the non-aggression principle is not ethical because it opposes the initiation of force even when they would consider the results of such initiation to be morally superior to the alternatives that they have identified. In arguing against the NAP, philosopher Matt Zwolinski has proposed the following scenario: \"Suppose that by imposing a very, very small tax on billionaires, I could provide life-saving vaccination for tens of thousands of desperately poor children. Even if we grant that taxation is aggression, and that aggression is generally wrong, is it really so obvious that the relatively minor aggression involved in these examples is wrong, given the tremendous benefit it produces?\"\n\nZwolinski also notes that the NAP is incompatible with any practice that produces any pollution, because pollution encroaches on the property rights of others. Therefore, the NAP prohibits both driving and starting fires. Citing Professor David Friedman, Professor Zwolinski notes that the NAP is unable to place a sensible limitation on risk-creating behavior, arguing: \n\nSome critics use the example of the trolley problem to invalidate NAP. In case of the runaway trolley, headed for five victims tied to the track, NAP does not allow a trolley passenger to flip the switch that diverts the trolley to a different track if there is a person tied to that track. That person would have been unharmed if nothing was done, therefore by flipping the switch NAP is violated. Another example often cited by critics is human shields.\n\nSome supporters argue that no one initiates force if their only option for self-defense is to use force against a greater number of people as long as they were not responsible for being in the position they are in. Murray Rothbard's and Walter Block's formulations of NAP avoid these objections by either specifying that the NAP applies only to a civilized context (and not 'lifeboat situations') or that it applies only to legal rights (as opposed to general morality). Thus a starving man may, in consonance with general morality, break into a hunting cabin and steal food, but nevertheless he is aggressing, i.e. violating the NAP, and (by most rectification theories) should pay compensation. Critics argue that the legal rights approach might allow people who can afford to pay a sufficiently large amount of compensation to get away with murder. They point out that local law, though based on NAP, may vary from proportional compensation to capital punishment to no compensation at all.\n\nOther critics state that the NAP is unethical because it does not provide for the violent prohibition of, and thereby supposedly legitimizes, several forms of aggression that do not involve intrusion on property rights, such as verbal sexual harassment, defamation, boycotting, noninvasive striking, and noninvasive discrimination.  If a victim thus provoked would turn to physical violence, according to the NAP, he would be labeled an aggressor. Supporters of the NAP, however, state that boycotting and defamation both constitute freedoms of speech and that boycotting, noninvasive striking, and noninvasive discrimination all constitute freedoms of association, and that both freedoms of association and of speech are nonaggressive. Supporters also point out that prohibiting physical retaliation against an action is not itself condonement \"of\" said action, and that generally there are other, nonphysical means by which one can combat social ills (\"e.g.\", discrimination) that do \"not\" violate the NAP.  Some supporters also state that while, most of the time, individuals choose voluntarily to engage in situations that may cause some degree of mental battering, this mental battering begins, when it cannot be avoided, to constitute unauthorized physical overload of the senses (\"i.e.\", eardrum and retina) and that the NAP, at that point, does apply.\n\nMany supporters consider verbal and written threats of imminent physical violence sufficient justification for a defensive response in a physical manner.<ref name=\"verbal/written threats of physical force\">Murray N. Rothbard, \"Self-Defense,\" ch. 12, in \"A Theory of Liberty,\" pt. 2 of \"The Ethics of Liberty\" (New York, N. Y.: New York University Press, 1998; orig. 1982), pp. 77–78, 80.  \"Cf.\", \"For a New Liberty\", p. 27.</ref><ref name=\"use of/threat of/substitution for physical force\">Linda & Morris Tannehill, \"The Market for Liberty\" (San Francisco: Fox & Wilkes, October 1993; orig. March 1970), pp. 4, 10.  \"Cf.\", pp. 77, 80</ref>  Such threats would then constitute a legitimate limit to permissible speech.  Because freedom of association entails the right of owners to choose who is permitted to enter or remain on their premises, legitimate property owners may \"also\" impose limitation on speech.  For example, the owner of a theatre, wishing to avoid a stampede, may prohibit those on her property from calling ‘fire!’ without just cause.  The owner of a bank, however, may not prohibit anyone from urging the general public to a bank run, except insofar as this occurs on the property of said owner.\n\nH. L. Mencken, a writer who influenced many libertarians, puts an ethical limit on the freedom of speech: \n\nSupporters also consider physical threats of imminent physical violence (\"e.g.\", pointing a firearm at innocent people, stocking up nuclear weapons that cannot be used discriminately against specific individual aggressors) sufficient justification for a defensive response in a physical manner.  Such threats would then constitute a legitimate limit to permissible action.\n\nCritics argue it is not possible to uphold NAP when protecting the environment as most pollution can never be traced back to the party that caused it. They therefore claim that only general broad government regulations will be able to protect the environment. Supporters cite the problem of the tragedy of the commons and argue that free-market environmentalism will be much more effective in conserving nature.\nPolitical theorist Hillel Steiner emphasizes that all things made come from natural resources and that the validity of any rights to those made things depends on the validity of the rights to the natural resources. If land was stolen then anyone buying produce from that land would not be the legitimate owner of the goods. Also, if natural resources cannot be privately owned but are, and always will be, the property of all of mankind then NAP would be violated if such a resource would be used without everybody's consent (see the Lockean proviso and free-market anarchism). Libertarian philosopher Roderick Long points out that, as natural resources are required not only for the production of goods but for the production of the human body as well, the very concept of self-ownership can only exist if the land itself is privately owned.\n\nConsequentialist libertarian David Friedman, who believes that the NAP should be understood as a relative rather than absolute principle, defends his view by using a Sorites argument. Friedman begins by stating what he considers obvious: A neighbor aiming his flashlight at someone's property is not aggression, or if it is, it is only aggression in a trivial technical sense. However, aiming at the same property with a gigawatt laser is certainly aggression by any reasonable definition. Yet both flashlight and laser shine photons onto the property, so there must be some cutoff point of how many photons one is permitted to shine upon a property before it is considered aggression. But the cutoff point cannot be found by deduction alone, because of the Sorites paradox, so the non-aggression principle is necessarily ambiguous. Friedman points out the difficulty of undertaking any activity that poses a certain amount of risk to third parties (e.g. flying) if the permission of thousands of people that might be affected by the activity is required.\n\n"}
{"id": "2100884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100884", "title": "Linear actuator", "text": "Linear actuator\n\nA linear actuator is an actuator that creates motion in a straight line, in contrast to the circular motion of a conventional electric motor. Linear actuators are used in machine tools and industrial machinery, in computer peripherals such as disk drives and printers, in valves and dampers, and in many other places where linear motion is required. Hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders inherently produce linear motion. Many other mechanisms are used to generate linear motion from a rotating motor. \n\nMechanical linear actuators typically operate by conversion of rotary motion into linear motion. Conversion is commonly made via a few simple types of mechanism:\n\nSome mechanical linear actuators only pull, such as hoists, chain drive and belt drives. Others only push (such as a cam actuator). Pneumatic and hydraulic cylinders, or lead screws can be designed to generate force in both directions.\n\nMechanical actuators typically convert rotary motion of a control knob or handle into linear displacement via screws and/or gears to which the knob or handle is attached. A jackscrew or car jack is a familiar mechanical actuator. Another family of actuators are based on the segmented spindle. Rotation of the jack handle is converted mechanically into the linear motion of the jack head. Mechanical actuators are also frequently used in the field of lasers and optics to manipulate the position of linear stages, rotary stages, mirror mounts, goniometers and other positioning instruments. For accurate and repeatable positioning, index marks may be used on control knobs. Some actuators include an encoder and digital position readout. These are similar to the adjustment knobs used on micrometers except their purpose is position adjustment rather than position measurement.\n\nHydraulic actuators or hydraulic cylinders typically involve a hollow cylinder having a piston inserted in it. An unbalanced pressure applied to the piston generates force that can move an external object. Since liquids are nearly incompressible, a hydraulic cylinder can provide controlled precise linear displacement of the piston. The displacement is only along the axis of the piston. A familiar example of a manually operated hydraulic actuator is a hydraulic car jack. Typically though, the term \"hydraulic actuator\" refers to a device controlled by a hydraulic pump.\n\nPneumatic actuators, or pneumatic cylinders, are similar to hydraulic actuators except they use compressed gas to generate force instead of a liquid. They work similarly to a piston in which air is pumped inside a chamber and pushed out of the other side of the chamber. Air actuators are not necessarily used for heavy duty machinery and instances where large amounts of weight are present. One of the reasons pneumatic linear actuators are preferred to other types is the fact that the power source is simply an air compressor. Because air is the input source, pneumatic actuators are able to be used in many places of mechanical activity. The downside is, most air compressors are large, bulky, and loud. They are hard to transport to other areas once installed. Pneumatic linear actuators are likely to leak and this makes them less efficient than mechanical linear actuators.\n\nThe piezoelectric effect is a property of certain materials in which application of a voltage to the material causes it to expand. Very high voltages correspond to only tiny expansions. As a result, piezoelectric actuators can achieve extremely fine positioning resolution, but also have a very short range of motion. In addition, piezoelectric materials exhibit hysteresis which makes it difficult to control their expansion in a repeatable manner.\n\nTwisted and coiled polymer (TCP) actuator also known as supercoiled polymer (SCP) actuator is a coiled polymer that can be actuated through resistive heating. . A TCP actuator look like a helical spring. TCP actuators are usually made from silver coated Nylon. TCP actuators can also be made from other electrical conductance coat such as gold. Twist induced TCP actuators should be under a load to keep the muscle extended. The electrical energy transforms to thermal energy due to electrical resistance, which also known as Joule heating, Ohmic heating, and resistive heating. As the temperature of the TCP actuator increases by Joule heating, the polymer contracts and it causes the actuator contraction .\n\nElectro-mechanical actuators are similar to mechanical actuators except that the control knob or handle is replaced with an electric motor. Rotary motion of the motor is converted to linear displacement. There are many designs of modern linear actuators and every company that manufactures them tends to have a proprietary method. The following is a generalized description of a very simple electro-mechanical linear actuator.\n\nTypically, an electric motor is mechanically connected to rotate a lead screw. A lead screw has a continuous helical thread machined on its circumference running along the length (similar to the thread on a bolt). Threaded onto the lead screw is a lead nut or ball nut with corresponding helical threads. The nut is prevented from rotating with the lead screw (typically the nut interlocks with a non-rotating part of the actuator body). Therefore, when the lead screw is rotated, the nut will be driven along the threads. The direction of motion of the nut depends on the direction of rotation of the lead screw. By connecting linkages to the nut, the motion can be converted to usable linear displacement. Most current actuators are built for high speed, high force, or a compromise between the two. When considering an actuator for a particular application, the most important specifications are typically travel, speed, force, accuracy, and lifetime. Most varieties are mounted on dampers or butterfly valves.\n\nThere are many types of motors that can be used in a linear actuator system. These include dc brush, dc brushless, stepper, or in some cases, even induction motors. It all depends on the application requirements and the loads the actuator is designed to move. For example, a linear actuator using an integral horsepower AC induction motor driving a lead screw can be used to operate a large valve in a refinery. In this case, accuracy and high movement resolution aren't needed, but high force and speed are. For electromechanical linear actuators used in laboratory instrumentation robotics, optical and laser equipment, or X-Y tables, fine resolution in the micron range and high accuracy may require the use of a fractional horsepower stepper motor linear actuator with a fine pitch lead screw. There are many variations in the electromechanical linear actuator system. It is critical to understand the design requirements and application constraints to know which one would be best.\n\nA linear actuator using standard motors will commonly have the motor as a separate cylinder attached to the side of the actuator, either parallel with the actuator or perpendicular to the actuator. The motor may be attached to the end of the actuator. The drive motor is of typical construction with a solid drive shaft that is geared to the drive nut or drive screw of the actuator.\n\nCompact linear actuators use specially designed motors that try to fit the motor and actuator into the smallest possible shape.\n\nIn the majority of linear actuator designs, the basic principle of operation is that of an inclined plane. The threads of a lead screw act as a continuous ramp that allows a small rotational force to be used over a long distance to accomplish movement of a large load over a short distance.\n\nMany variations on the basic design have been created. Most focus on providing general improvements such as a higher mechanical efficiency, speed, or load capacity. There is also a large engineering movement towards actuator miniaturization.\n\nMost electro-mechanical designs incorporate a lead screw and lead nut. Some use a ball screw and ball nut. In either case the screw may be connected to a motor or manual control knob either directly or through a series of gears. Gears are typically used to allow a smaller (and weaker) motor spinning at a higher rpm to be geared down to provide the torque necessary to spin the screw under a heavier load than the motor would otherwise be capable of driving directly. Effectively this sacrifices actuator speed in favor of increased actuator thrust. In some applications the use of worm gear is common as this allow a smaller built in dimension still allowing great travel length.\n\nA traveling-nut linear actuator has a motor that stays attached to one end of the lead screw (perhaps indirectly through a gear box), the motor spins the lead screw, and the lead nut is restrained from spinning so it travels up and down the lead screw.\n\nA traveling-screw linear actuator has a lead screw that passes entirely through the motor.\nIn a traveling-screw linear actuator, the motor \"crawls\" up and down a lead screw that is restrained from spinning. The only spinning parts are inside the motor, and may not be visible from the outside.\n\nSome lead screws have multiple \"starts\". This means they have multiple threads alternating on the same shaft. One way of visualizing this is in comparison to the multiple color stripes on a candy cane. This allows for more adjustment between thread pitch and nut/screw thread contact area, which determines the extension speed and load carrying capacity (of the threads), respectively.\n\nLinear screw actuators can have a static loading capacity, meaning that when the motor stops the actuator essentially locks in place and can support a load that is either pulling or pushing on the actuator. This static load capacity increases mobility and speed.\n\nThe braking force of the actuator varies with the angular pitch of the screw threads and the specific design of the threads. Acme threads have a very high static load capacity, while ball screws have an extremely low load capacity and can be nearly free-floating.\n\nGenerally it is not possible to vary the static load capacity of screw actuators without additional technology. The screw thread pitch and drive nut design defines a specific load capacity that cannot be dynamically adjusted.\n\nIn some cases, high viscosity grease can be added to linear screw actuators to increase the static load. Some manufacturers use this to alter the load for specific needs.\n\nStatic load capacity can be added to a linear screw actuator using an electromagnetic brake system, which applies friction to the spinning drive nut. For example, a spring may be used to apply brake pads to the drive nut, holding it in position when power is turned off. When the actuator needs to be moved, an electromagnet counteracts the spring and releases the braking force on the drive nut.\n\nSimilarly an electromagnetic ratchet mechanism can be used with a linear screw actuator so that the drive system lifting a load will lock in position when power to the actuator is turned off. To lower the actuator, an electromagnet is used to counteract the spring force and unlock the ratchet.\n\nDynamic load capacity is typically referred to as the amount of force the linear actuator is capable of providing during operation. This force will vary with screw type (amount of friction restricting movement) and the motor driving the movement. Dynamic load is the figure which most actuators are classified by, and is a good indication of what applications it would suit best.\n\nIn most cases when using an electro-mechanical actuator, it is preferred to have some type of speed control. Such controllers vary the voltage supplied to the motor, which in turn changes the speed at which the lead screw turns. Adjusting the gear ratio is another way to adjust speed. Some actuators are available with several different gearing options.\n\nThe duty cycle of a motor refers to the amount of time the actuator can be run before it needs to cool down. Staying within this guideline when operating an actuator is key to its longevity and performance. If the duty cycle rating is exceeded, then overheating, loss of power, and eventual burning of the motor is risked.\n\nA linear motor is functionally the same as a rotary electric motor with the rotor and stator circular magnetic field components laid out in a straight line. Where a rotary motor would spin around and re-use the same magnetic pole faces again, the magnetic field structures of a linear motor are physically repeated across the length of the actuator.\n\nSince the motor moves in a linear fashion, no lead screw is needed to convert rotary motion to linear. While high capacity is possible, the material and/or motor limitations on most designs are surpassed relatively quickly due to a reliance solely on magnetic attraction and repulsion forces. Most linear motors have a low load capacity compared to other types of linear actuators.\nLinear motors have an advantage in outdoor or dirty environments in that the two halves do not need to contact each other, and so the electromagnetic drive coils can be waterproofed and sealed against moisture and corrosion, allowing for a very long service life.\n\nTelescoping linear actuators are specialized linear actuators used where space restrictions exist. Their range of motion is many times greater than the unextended length of the actuating member.\n\nA common form is made of concentric tubes of approximately equal length that extend and retract like sleeves, one inside the other, such as the telescopic cylinder.\n\nOther more specialized telescoping actuators use actuating members that act as rigid linear shafts when extended, but break that line by folding, separating into pieces and/or uncoiling when retracted. Examples of telescoping linear actuators include:\n\n\n\n"}

The show is based on the 1980 motion picture of the same name. Using a mixture of drama and music, it followed the lives of the students and faculty at the New York City High School for the Performing Arts—a fictional establishment, but based heavily on the actual Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts. Most interior scenes were filmed in Hollywood, California. In all seasons except the third, the show filmed several exterior scenes on location in New York City.\n\nThe popularity of the series, particularly in the UK, led to several hit records and live concert tours by the cast. Despite its success, very few of the actors maintained high-profile careers after the series was cancelled. A number of the cast members were seen again briefly in \"Bring Back...Fame\", a reunion special made for UK television in 2008.\n\nThe show was produced by MGM Television and aired Thursday nights at 8:00–9:00 on NBC beginning on January 7, 1982. Despite glowing reviews from critics, ratings were less than impressive, and NBC cancelled it after only two seasons. However, by special arrangement with LBS Communications, MGM revived the series for first-run syndication in the fall of 1983, where it continued for four more seasons, with the last first-run episode airing in the US on May 18, 1987.\n\nIra Steven Behr wrote twelve episodes of the series. He recalled: \"I did three years on \"Fame\", which was a lot of fun and was also in syndication. We had no one looking over our shoulder. We got to do some wonderfully bizarre things on the show, and the only time they gave us any trouble was the last show I was going to write after I knew we were cancelled. It was going to be Road Warrior meets \"Fame\". It was a show that takes place in the future, and you could only sing for the state. It was a fascist society, and we were going to have motorcycles going through the school and have Iggy Pop as the guest star. It was great, and I was in the midst of writing the episode when somehow MGM read somewhere that we planned to burn down the sets, which was a lie. We were going to trash them a bit, but it wasn't the last episode. We had one more after that, and they stopped me from writing it.\"\n\nFollowing its cancellation, two versions of the series were syndicated in reruns: the original hour-long episodes, which usually contained a primary plot, a subplot and two or more musical numbers; and a second version, stripped of the musical numbers and the subplot and reduced to 30 minutes in length.\n\nThe show's theme song was a pop hit for singer Irene Cara, having been featured in the motion picture. A re-recorded version of the theme, using similar instrumentation to the 1980 track, was used in the TV series and sung by co-star Erica Gimpel, who played Coco Hernandez.\n\nAlthough Gimpel left the series midway through the third season (after the show moved from NBC to first-run syndication in 1983), her opening vocals were still heard on the show for two more seasons. An updated version of the song, featuring a modern, synthesized hard-rock flavor, was introduced in the fall of 1985 and performed by new cast member Loretta Chandler (Dusty). This version ran for the final two seasons of \"Fame\".\n\n\"I Still Believe In Me\", from an episode of the series titled \"Passing Grade\", was nominated for an Emmy Award for Best Original Song. It was performed by Erica Gimpel and Debbie Allen, and co-written by Gary Portnoy who would go on to co-write and sing the theme from \"Cheers\". In the UK, two singles credited to The Kids from \"Fame\", \"Hi-Fidelity\" and \"Starmaker\", reached the top ten.\n\nThere were four cast members from the original movie who appeared in the television series. Lee Curreri portrayed the character Bruno Martelli, an introverted musical genius. Gene Anthony Ray portrayed Leroy Johnson, a tough hood from the projects with a natural talent for dance who muscles his way into an audition and wins. In the film, Leroy is also semi-illiterate, but this was dropped in favor of him having \"fourth-grade reading level\" in the television series. Albert Hague played teacher Benjamin Shorofsky, a German music teacher who constantly battled with Bruno Martelli over musical styles. The final cast member from the film was Debbie Allen, who portrayed dance instructor Lydia Grant. Allen only appeared briefly in the movie, but her character was expanded in the series. She also became the show's original choreographer, in addition to directing several episodes and co-producing one season.\n\nThere were also several characters carried over from the movie, played by different actors. Irene Cara was offered the role of Coco Hernandez by the show's producers; however, she politely declined, for she wished to focus on developing her budding singing career. The part was played by Erica Gimpel. Actor P. R. Paul played Montgomery McNeil in the series, while Paul McCrane portrayed the gay student in the film. The Montgomery character was changed for TV and was no longer gay. English teacher Elizabeth Sherwood was played in the film by actress Anne Meara, but in the series was played by actress Carol Mayo Jenkins.\n\nThe character of Ralph Garci (Tommy Aguilar inheriting the role played in the film by Barry Miller) appeared in the first episode of the TV version, but was metamorphosed into the character of Danny Amatullo, and played by Carlo Imperato. The character Doris Schwartz, played by Valerie Landsburg, was in the series while the character Doris Finsecker appeared in the film version and was portrayed by Maureen Teefy.\n\nThe arts-focused cable network Ovation began airing reruns of \"Fame\" in 2011 for a period.\n\nThe series won a number of Emmy awards and in 1983 and 1984 was voted the . Actress, director and choreographer Debbie Allen, who had a small role in the motion picture but played a major character in the television version, also won several awards.\n\n\n\n\nSony Pictures Home Entertainment released the first season of \"Fame\" to DVD in Region 1 on November 1, 2005. This is now out of print as the home video rights are now owned by 20th Century Fox through Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment division as of 2019.\n\n20th Century Fox (currently distributed by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment) (under license from MGM & MGM Television) released the complete first and second seasons of \"Fame\" on DVD in Region 1 and Region 2 on September 15, 2009. On January 12, 2010, Fox released seasons 1 & 2 in separate collections.\n\n\nOn 27 December 2008, Channel 4 in the UK screened a 90-minute special titled \"Bring Back...Fame\", which sought out and reunited some of the original cast members of the television series.\n\nPresented by Justin Lee Collins, and apparently filmed the previous summer, the show followed the presenter around the United States as he tracked down actors from the series and then staged a reunion. The programme showed Collins appearing to surprise the former cast members in locations including restaurants, a recording studio, a gym, LAX airport and a cinema, before interviewing them and persuading them to take part in the reunion.\n\nThe actors featured in the programme were Debbie Allen, Carol Mayo Jenkins, Lee Curreri, Erica Gimpel, Valerie Landsburg and Carlo Imperato. Also interviewed were Irene Cara and the mother of the late Gene Anthony Ray. It was not stated whether other actors from the series had also been approached but had declined to take part. Excerpts from the TV series were shown throughout the programme. The final scenes of the programme showed the six principal actors and a number of backing dancers taking part in a recreation of the title sequence of the TV programme.\n\nThe programme was made for and broadcast on Channel 4, despite \"Fame\" having originally been shown in the UK on the BBC.\n\nIn May 2019, eight members of the cast: Lee Curreri, Erica Gimpel, Carlo Imperato, Valerie Landsburg, PR Paul, Cynthia Gibb, Jesse Borrego and Nia Peeples performed two Reunion Concert in Liverpool. This was the first time in over 35 years that the cast had performed together. In addition to the concerts there is a 3-day fan Convention: The Fame Family Experience, the first of its kind anywhere in the World.

They also teamed in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), and Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX.\n\nHall and Nash were occasionally joined by Sean Waltman, forming a trio most frequently known as The Wolfpac. The three men were all real life friends and part of the backstage wrestling group known as \"The Kliq\".\n\nHall (wrestling as \"Razor Ramon\") and Nash (wrestling as \"Diesel\") first teamed in the World Wrestling Federation in March 1995 , facing Jeff Jarrett and Shawn Michaels in a series of matches at house shows and in dark matches. They teamed once more during the \"WWF in High Gear\" tour of Germany in April 1995, facing Jarrett and Sycho Sid. Hall and Nash reformed their tag team in January 1996, facing Jarrett and Sycho Sid/Hunter Hearst Helmsley at a series of house shows.\n\n\"The Outsiders\" were formed in 1996 when Hall and Nash returned to WCW after leaving the WWF. In the storyline, Hall, better known to fans at the time as Razor Ramon, led an invasion, appearing on WCW programming and insinuating that he was doing so under orders from his WWF employers and warning that he would soon be joined by others. He was joined by former WWF World Heavyweight Champion Nash, then best known as Diesel, two weeks later. A lawsuit from the WWF caused Eric Bischoff to ask The Outsiders point-blank if they worked for the WWF, which both emphatically denied. Their angle was the precursor to the villainous turn of Hulk Hogan and the formation of the New World Order (nWo), a major wrestling storyline that dominated WCW programming for several years afterwards.\n\nThe Outsiders captured the WCW World Tag Team Championship six times, first winning them from Harlem Heat (Booker T and Stevie Ray) at Halloween Havoc in October 1996. They dropped the title to The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott Steiner) at the 1997 Souled Out event, only to have WCW President Eric Bischoff reverse the decision on the next night's episode of \"Nitro\". A near repeat of these events occurred the next month when Hall and Nash lost to the team of Lex Luger and The Giant at SuperBrawl VII, with Bischoff again abusing his power and quickly returning the championship to The Outsiders. The Outsiders became the cornerstones of the nWo and were popular with the fans despite being villains and feuding with fan favorites such as the Steiners and Lex Luger and The Giant. During promos, Hall would occasionally refer to The Outsiders as \"The People's Choice\" in recognition of their popularity.\n\nIn October 1997, fellow nWo and former Kliq member Syxx began substituting for a legitimately injured Nash, teaming with Hall to defend the championship on numerous occasions. The Outsiders and Syxx claimed they were doing this under \"Wolfpac Rules\", also referring to themselves as The Wolfpac. Hall and Syxx eventually lost the title to The Steiner Brothers on October 13, 1997. The Outsiders and Steiners traded the title back and forth at both televised and non-televised events until Scott Steiner turned on his brother, joining the nWo and giving the title to Hall and Nash.\n\nIn May 1998 at Slamboree, The Outsiders were scheduled to defend the tag team titles against Sting and The Giant during a storyline in which the nWo was splitting in two warring factions. Hall turned on Nash during this match, costing them the title as well as dissolving the tag team, having chosen to join nWo Hollywood as opposed to the splinter faction Nash formed under The Wolfpac name. Hall's personal problems began to affect him and while Nash was his enemy, he still showed obvious care and concern for his estranged friend. The split team faced each other once later in the year where Nash repeatedly hit powerbombs on the inebriated Hall into unconsciousness, before leaving the ring to take a countout loss.\n\nThey reunited in early 1999, and stayed a team even after the nWo once again fell apart. After an aimless couple of months (Nash lost a retirement match), of just wandering around being pests to the other talent, they won the WCW World Tag Team Championship one last time in December 1999. It did not last, however, as Hall legitimately no-showed an event, thus the title was stripped from them, and the team was dissolved.\n\nIn 2002, with the WWF owning WCW and its trademarks, The Outsiders and Hollywood Hulk Hogan reformed as the nWo in a WWF ring. The reunion was short lived as Hogan became a fan favorite at WrestleMania X8, Nash got legitimately injured, and Hall and X-Pac (the former Syxx, who rejoined the group shortly after Hogan's fan favorite turn) were both released from WWE just months after their arrival.\n\nIn late 2004 and early 2005, Hall and Nash teamed again, this time in TNA as part of a trio with fellow nWo 2000 alum Jeff Jarrett, but they were not allowed to use the name New World Order or The Outsiders, as WWE now owns the trademarks of both names. In October 2004, vignettes began airing, where Nash and Hall appeared to be on different sides in the upcoming NWA World Heavyweight Championship match between Jeff Jarrett and Jeff Hardy at Victory Road. Hall and Nash debuted on November 7 at Victory Road interfering in the ladder match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and in the end revealed they were on the same side by both attacking Hardy with guitars. After the match, Nash cut a promo on how they were better than the entire TNA locker room and challenged anyone to oppose them. A.J. Styles accepted, but was beaten down by the new stable. Randy Savage then made his debut in TNA, entering the Impact Zone to face off with the villains.\n\nOn \"Impact!\" the following week, Nash proclaimed the trio of himself, Hall, and Jarrett to be called \"The Kings of Wrestling\". Hall, Nash and Jarrett began wearing goofy Elvis-style jumpsuits and sunglasses, and wreaked havoc on multiple episodes of \"Impact!\" before being challenged and defeated by Savage, Styles and Hardy in a six-man tag team match at Turning Point. After the six-man tag match, Savage was next in line for a title shot (having pinned the champion, Jarrett, in the match), but in light of him leaving the company, Director of Authority Dusty Rhodes appointed a three-way match at Final Resolution to achieve a number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The first two competitors announced were Diamond Dallas Page and Monty Brown. The third was Kevin Nash, Jarrett's ally in The Kings of Wrestling. The group hit a period of friction, as Nash openly competed for the title shot at Final Resolution (losing when Page dumped him over the top rope), before earning a shot at Jarrett's NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Against All Odds, where Nash was unsuccessful in his attempt at the title, after which The Kings of Wrestling parted ways.\n\nHall resurfaced on the \"Impact!\" show prior to Genesis in 2007, teasing as Sting's partner for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship tag team match. At Turning Point, Hall and Nash were supposed to have their first tag team match together in a TNA ring since 2004, also teaming with Samoa Joe to take on The Angle Alliance, but Hall was replaced in the match by Eric Young, who eventually won the match with his team. Hall told TNA management he did not show at the event because of health problems.\n\nOn the January 4, 2010, live, three hour, Monday night episode of \"Impact!\", Hall and Sean Waltman (the former Syxx and X-Pac) returned to TNA and quickly reformed their alliance with Nash. This incarnation would soon be officially known as The Band. Nash and Hall were advertised to make their return as a tag team on January 17 at Genesis, but at the event Hall was replaced by Waltman, who teaming up with Nash went on to lose a tag team match against Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode). The reunion did not last long, as on the February 4 episode of \"Impact!\", Hall and Waltman turned on Nash. However, this betrayal was a ruse, as at Destination X, Nash turned on his new partner Eric Young and re-joined Hall and Syxx-Pac, who, with their victory, now had contracts with the company. Upon winning these new contracts the trio began using an instrumental version of the nWo Wolfpac theme, as well as occasionally calling themselves The Wolfpac once again, though their official name remained The Band.\n\nAt Lockdown, Hall and Nash made their return to tag team action in a steel cage match, where they were defeated by Team 3D. On May 4 at the tapings of the May 13 episode of \"Impact!\", after TNA World Tag Team Champion Matt Morgan had been attacked by Samoa Joe, Nash cashed in his \"Feast or Fired\" contract, teaming with Hall, and pinned him to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship. The Band's newest member, Eric Young, was also given a share of the Championship and the three defended the titles under the Freebird rule. At the June 14 tapings of \"Impact!\", The Band was stripped of the TNA World Tag Team Championship due to Hall's legal problems.\n\nHall and Nash main evented Dream Stage Entertainment's May 8, 2004 Hustle 3 pay-per-view, losing to the team of Shinya Hashimoto and Naoya Ogawa.\n\nOn August 10, 2008, Nash and Hall teamed up again as The Outsiders at Bloodymania II to defeat The Thomaselli Brothers (Brandon and Vito Thomaselli). Nash also positioned himself as a member of the Juggalo World Order, which Hall was already a part of.\n\nOn the March 21, 2009, The Outsiders teamed for Great Lakes Championship Wrestling against The New Age Outlaws in what was the first nWo vs. D-Generation X match. Nash walked out on Scott Hall, and the two were set to face off later in June.\n\nStarting in 2014, Hall and Nash would take part in several nWo reunion segments together in WWE.\n\nOn the August 11, 2014 episode of \"Raw\", aired on Hulk Hogan's 61st birthday, featured Scott Hall and Kevin Nash as guests. The two shared a moment with Hogan, revealing an nWo shirt hidden under his \"Hulkamania\" shirt. They were interrupted by Brock Lesnar, who told Hogan, \"Party's over, grandpa\". Lesnar backed out of the ring when confronted by John Cena, his opponent at SummerSlam.\n\nOn the January 19, 2015 episode of \"Raw\", Hall, Nash, and X-Pac came out as the nWo for Hall's survey segment. They were interrupted by The Ascension, who made reference to them as the Wolfpac in an antagonistic promo before getting beaten down by the nWo, the APA, and The New Age Outlaws. On March 29 at WrestleMania 31, The Outsiders returned with Hogan to assist their long-time rival Sting in his WrestleMania debut match against Triple H. The nWo helped to fight off X-Pac and The New Age Outlaws, who had interfered on behalf of Triple H as D-Generation X. Shawn Michaels later joined Triple H's side, turning the match in his favor, which Triple H would go on to win.\n\n\n"}

The group consisted of a freak show of wrestlers, including the masked Golga (whose mask was supposed to hide a bone growth disorder yet made him look deformed anyway), the deranged Luna Vachon, the towering Kurrgan (who stood at seven feet tall) and the even larger Giant Silva. On the May 25, 1998 episode of \"Monday Night Raw\", the stable appeared in a segment with \"Howard Stern Show\" regulars Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf and Crackhead Bob. Under the leadership of the Jackyl, the Oddities were a fearsome group of heels though they did not win any titles. Jackyl, however, soon left the Oddities to become the manager of Hell's Henchmen (later renamed The Acolytes), before leaving WWE altogether.\n\nOn the July 28, 1998 episode of \"Raw\", the Oddities were re-introduced, this time as babyfaces, by Sable, a former enemy of Vachon who had discovered their fun loving side and made them feel happy in spite of their freakish appearances. The same night, Golga (now turned into a fan of Eric Cartman) defeated Marc Mero, whom Sable was feuding with, and the group celebrated in the ring afterwards. Off-screen, the idea to pair Sable with the Oddities had been Vince McMahon's. The Oddities made their pay-per-view debut at SummerSlam under a new entrance music performed live by Insane Clown Posse, who also started accompanying them to the ring and dancing energetically along with all of them before their matches. Their entrance video featured clips from the 1932 horror film \"Freaks\", as the song and video celebrated the film's message, that the \"freaks\" were actually decent and polite and that the so-called \"normal\" people were jerks. At the event, Kurrgan, Golga and Giant Silva defeated the numerically superior Kaientai (Taka Michinoku, Dick Togo, Mens Teioh and Sho Funaki) thanks to their enormous individual sizes.\n\nThey later started a feud with The Headbangers (Mosh and Thrasher), who feigned friendship to attack the group on September 21, 1998. The Oddities scored several victories against them thanks to interventions by Insane Clown Posse, which caused The Headbangers started targeting them specifically. At 's \"Sunday Night Heat\" tapings in October, the Oddities defeated Los Boricuas (Jose Estrada, Miguel Pérez, Jr. and Jesus Castillo), but The Headbangers intervened and attacked ICP after the bout. This and similar incidents frustrated the duo, who started blaming the Oddities for their beatdowns. Violent J and Shaggy worked to become active wrestlers in the group, but they also demonstrated too much aggression, causing the disqualification of the group in a rematch against Kai En Tai on October 20 in \"Raw\" when they attacked the referee. Finally, on the November 23 episode of \"Monday Night Raw\", the Insane Clown Posse turned on the Oddities and joined The Headbangers to assault and humiliate their former stable with Mace. The following week, the remaining Oddities returned the attack in and challenged Mosh and Thrasher to a match in , but they were defeated. The group then enlisted the aid of George \"The Animal\" Steele, who was introduced in a giant gift box to attack the Headbangers by surprise. He was referred by the announcers as the \"original Oddity\" . The same month, however, Vachon became a villainess and abandoned the group to feud over the WWF Women's Championship with Sable.\n\nIn 1999, the Oddities began another feud, this time against a coalition between Too Much (Brian Christopher and Scott Taylor) and The Disciples of Apocalypse (8-Ball and Skull), but it was short and unsuccessful. At the Royal Rumble in 1999, Golga made a short appearance before being eliminated by Steve Austin. Kurrgan also appeared and lasted longer than Golga before being eliminated by Kane. In February 1999, all 4 members of the Oddities were released by the WWF.\n\nIn August 2007, Giant Silva led an unofficial incarnation of the stable named Odd-It-Tees in National Wrestling Superstars, teaming up with a Golga impersonator named Goal-Duh and being managed by George Steele. They were later joined by The Zombie. The team was short-lived and competed for the last time in 2009.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2100956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100956", "title": "Set list", "text": "Set list\n\nA set list, or most commonly, setlist, is typically a handwritten or printed document that is created as a blueprint for a performance that lists the order of songs, jokes, stories or other performance elements that an artist intends to play, or has played, during a specific performance. (In the case of music concerts, the website setlist.fm defines a setlist to be the list of the songs a band or artist actually played during a concert).\n\nA setlist can be made of nearly any material that can be written or printed on, but are most commonly made with paper, cardboard, or cardstock. They are also often laminated as well, especially for outdoor stage settings. The set list is usually taped directly to the stage in front of the performers, or somewhere the musicians can see it, such as to a monitor or amplifier.\n\nArtists use setlists for a variety of reasons beyond just being a reminder of the order in which their material is to be played during a performance. They are most often used to help the artist or band to create the overall mood of a live performance by allowing them to create a memorable sense of range and variety in the tone, tempo, and dynamics within their performance.\n\nThey are also used to create sets for a specific audience or location, an increasingly popular idea that is aided by the use of today's technologies like the use of instant polling on social media and websites, where fans can choose the material to be performed. \n\nMany performers also craft their playlists in ways that highlight other elements of their stage shows such as the visual ambiance of the stage, choreography, or in an order that defines things like different albums or eras of their career.\n\nMusic fans also refer to the set list in the non-physical sense of what a performing artist chooses to play. For many artists, the same set list is played for every performance on a given concert tour. For others, this is not necessarily the case, and for their devoted fan bases who follow the artist around on tour, the most variety in the setlist from night to night is longed for. The Grateful Dead is one example, having never played the same set list twice in the band's entire existence. Some such artists have predetermined \"slots\" in an otherwise mostly fixed show where different songs can be swapped in and out; other artists guarantee that the same song will not be played at two shows in a row; and still other artists such as Van Morrison use no predetermined set list at all.\n\nThere are websites that track and report information on such things as the venue and bands on the bill of each date, as well as which band members were in attendance, copies of the show posters and other memorabilia available, and most importantly, the actual setlist used for that particular event. This is done to provide a more accurate record of each individual show, which is later used to differentiate between performances during a tour, as many artists will change their setlist from one night to another. In the pre-smartphone era, devoted followers attending concerts of popular artists such as Bruce Springsteen or Led Zeppelin, which have very large fan bases spanning the globe, often took on the task of tracking which songs were played and in what order, creating their own handwritten version of the correct setlist for the event to be shared later with other fans through fan clubs and other forums. When early cellular phones became commonplace with the general public, people began using text-messaging to report the songs played in real-time to a friend or fellow fan who would then update a running setlist on one or more Internet forums devoted to the performer of the night. When internet-connected smartphones came about, fans began to post the setlists directly to these forums and websites themselves, often as part of a running play-by-play commentary of their concert experiences on social media sites such as Myspace and later Twitter.\n\nCollecting setlists has become nearly as popular for music fans as collecting ticket stubs and show posters, with the actual physical setlist becoming a treasured and uniquely rare souvenir for concert goers and fans of music, in general, . Fans often wait around after a concert just so they can grab one off the stage after a performance or so they can try requesting one from a roadie or other event staff. Crew members also sometimes keep items like original setlists, guitar picks, drumsticks and other items used during a performance as keepsakes or to later sell in the memorabilia market or on auction websites such as eBay, where collectors, fans, and concert attendees who are looking to the highlight their own experience of a particular show can purchase them for their own collection. In some cases, so great is the urge for a fan to obtain a setlist that they do not wait for a show to end before trying to get their hands on one.\n\n"}

The crater forms a shallow depression in the surface, with small craters along the southeastern and southwestern rim.\n\nBy convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Sundman.\n\nThe Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission ended with a planned lunar impact on April 18, 2014. Later, the exact impact location was found to be near the eastern rim of Sundman V crater.\n\n"}

He was a Liberal member of the Australian House of Representatives between 2004 and 2007, representing the South Australian electorate of Kingston.\n\nRichardson joined the South Australia Police (SAPOL) at a young age, serving in the elite Star Force unit for thirteen years. Investigated for unethical behaviour while a police officer he was precluded from receiving the National Medal, but he did receive the Police Service Medal (a SAPOL award). Richardson shared his police career with a number of other activities, only resigning from the force upon entering federal parliament in 2004.\n\nWhile actively involved in police duties, he also played Australian rules football for the West Torrens club, and spent several years coaching local teams. After retiring from football, he moved into sports management. His clients included international cricketer Jason Gillespie and football player Byron Pickett. While a police officer he was charged with six counts of promoting a pyramid marketing scheme. However no evidence was tendered in the case and all charges were dropped.\n\nRichardson was a friend of former state MP Robert Brokenshire and was approached to stand as a Liberal candidate at the 1998 election, but declined for family reasons. In 2003 he was again approached, and this time accepted the offer to nominate for the seat of Kingston. There was some speculation that former Australian Football League player Nigel Smart was also being encouraged to nominate, but this did not eventuate. Richardson won preselection for the Kingston with broad factional support. \n\nKingston was held by the incumbent Australian Labor Party MP, Assistant Shadow Treasurer David Cox, by a narrow margin. Polling in the lead-up to the 2004 election suggested that Cox was likely hold the seat. Several commentators, including Antony Green, agreed with that conclusion. However, there was a swing to Richardson and the Liberal Party at the poll. After eleven days of counting Richardson overtook Cox on postal and absentee votes, eventually winning by 119 votes after preferences.\n\nRichardson is socially conservative. In the abortion debate that occurred in 2005, he argued that abortion is unacceptable in all cases apart from when rape is involved. However he largely concentrated on the issue of road safety, a focus of much of his career with the police force. He pushed for a number of reforms to decrease road deaths, including raising the driving age in South Australia to 17, limiting the engine capacity of cars driven by young drivers, and doubling demerit points for speeding or drink-driving. He also repeatedly advocated the extension of the Noarlunga Centre railway line to Sellicks Beach, but no federal government funding was forthcoming.\n\nRichardson's Labor opponent for the 2007 federal election was psychologist Amanda Rishworth, who had previously stood for the State seat of Fisher. A January 2007 poll in The Advertiser showed that on two party preferred terms, Rishworth was ahead in Kingston by 56% to 44%. A July poll in the same newspaper reported that Rishworth was ahead 57% to 43%. A mid-campaign October 2007 poll in The Advertiser had the margin at 56% to 44% and Richardson's primary vote at 34%.\n\nIn October 2007, Richardson attracted controversy for pulling out of a debate on industrial relations with his Labor rival, arranging for industrial relations minister Joe Hockey to debate his challenger instead.\nRichardson was defeated by Rishworth at the election.\n\nRichardson was preselected to contest the state seat of Mawson at the 2010 election, but he stepped down amid revelations that he faced the criminal charge of impersonating a police officer. On 14 January 2010 a pre trial hearing into the matter was heard in the Adelaide Magistrates Court. It was revealed in the pre-trial hearing that the allegation was related to an attempt to dissuade a witness from testifying in an assault case against Richardson's son. The telephone call had been traced to federal Parliament House where Richardson was then serving as an MP. Police did not proceed with a charge of impersonating a police officer as the statute of limitations had expired, and he was eventually acquitted on a charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice.\n\nRichardson then became a real estate agent with the Morphett Vale branch of Elders Real Estate in South Australia, after a very short period he moved on to Professionals at Hallett Cove. He was elected as a councillor with the City of Onkaparinga, topping the poll for the Mid South Coast Ward in the 2010 council elections.\n\nAt the 2014 state election, he contested the seat of Kaurna as an independent and received 9.3% of the vote, finishing fourth out of five candidates.\n\nRichardson stood again for local government election in the City of Onkaparinga in 2018 but was defeated.\n"}
{"id": "2100994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100994", "title": "The Headbangers", "text": "The Headbangers\n\nThe Headbangers were a professional wrestling tag team consisting of Mosh (Charles Warrington) and Thrasher (Glenn Ruth). As the name of the team implied, their gimmick was that they were a pair of metalheads, complete with heavy metal related T-shirts, kilts, piercings, goatees, shaved heads, and black face paint.\n\nThey were both trained by Larry Sharpe in New Jersey in the early 1990s. Warrington and Ruth teamed up in 1994 as the Spiders in their home state, New Jersey, for the National Wrestling Alliance. They made an Eastern Championship Wrestling appearance in June 1994, losing to The Bad Breed (Axl and Ian Rotten). The Spiders had a brief stint in Dallas for the NWA in 1995. Later that year they moved down to Tennessee in Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW). It was there that they changed their gimmicks to the Headbangers. Their slogan was \"Real men wear skirts.\" During their time in SMW, they feuded with The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) and The Thugs (Tracy Smothers and Tony Anthony), and later sided with Jim Cornette and Terry Gordy in their feud with Brad Armstrong over the SMW Heavyweight Championship. By the end of the year, SMW folded and they joined the United States Wrestling Association (USWA). In December 1995, they debuted as jobbers in the WWF as the Spiders, the Arachnoids, and even used their real names. On an episode of \"Monday Night Raw\" they got a World Tag Team Title shot against the Smoking Gunns. They returned to the USWA.\n\nThe team debuted on WWF television on the November 24, 1996 episode of \"Superstars\" under their Headbangers gimmick defeating Alex Porteau and \nAldo Montoya. Shortly after that, they began wearing nuns' clothing and billed as the Flying Nuns (a play on the television show of the same name), Sister Angelica and Mother Smucker. They were also humorously billed as hailing from a monastery in the Himalayas. On an episode of \"Shotgun Saturday Night\", Brother Love showed up to manage the Nuns. After the Nuns defeated The Godwinns, Love renamed them the Sisters of Love. The gimmick was short-lived, but they kept the skirts when they returned to being The Headbangers in January 1997. They later had T-shirts with the phrase \"Real men wear skirts\" and occasionally wore sports bras over their shirts. The duo often carried a boombox to the ring, and on one occasion, Mosh vomited during an interview.\n\nThroughout 1997, The Headbangers (who were Tweeners), feuded with The Godwinns, as well as Doug Furnas and Phil Lafon, often finding themselves on the losing end. They faced Legion of Doom during their surprise return match on February 24 to a double countout. At WrestleMania 13, The Headbangers won a four-way elimination match for a shot at the WWF Tag Team Championship. The team was seen on New York's WABC-TV in June, which re-aired on WWF programming.\n\nThe Headbangers won the vacant Tag Team title at after Mosh pinned Owen Hart, thanks to run-in interference by Steve Austin. Mosh and Thrasher would lose the titles to the Godwinns at in October. They faced the New Age Outlaws in their debut match as a team on October 20 and frequently challenged them into the following the year for the Tag Team title.\n\nThe two are seen backstage playing with Bret Hart's son, Blade, in the 1998 documentary film \"\". The footage depicts events from the previous year.\n\nBoth Mosh and Thrasher entered the 1998 Royal Rumble and both lasted over 10 minutes before Mosh was eliminated by Kurrgan and Thrasher by Steve Austin. On February 17, 1998, The Headbangers won the NWA World Tag Team Championship from The Rock 'n' Roll Express, which aired on the February 23 edition of Raw Is War. They feuded with The Quebecers and the Oddities throughout the year and become the first Maryland Championship Wrestling Tag Team Champions on August 18 defeating Jimmy Cicero and Julio Sanchez in the finals of a tournament.\n\nThe Headbangers were both meant to compete in the 1999 Royal Rumble, but Thrasher suffered a (legitimate) knee injury and was shelved while Mosh was (kayfabe) attacked backstage by Mabel as a way to write both men off television. While Thrasher was injured, Mosh would be repackaged as Beaver Cleavage and then Chaz, performed in singles competition and began having problems with his on-screen girlfriend, Marianna Komlos. He was kayfabe arrested on an episode of \"Sunday Night Heat\" in September after Komlos claimed he hit her. After Chaz's match on October 5, Glenn Ruth (Thrasher) showed GTV footage of Mariana applying makeup to create the effect of wounds. This proved her accusations false, and The Headbangers subsequently reunited. They then took on a gimmick where they dressed as the opponents that they feuded with, such as the Dudley Boyz and Mean Street Posse. The duo later turned heel and began to dress in drag, which included wearing breast cones.\n\nMosh entered in the 2000 Royal Rumble alone eliminated by Rikishi; however, The Headbangers continued performing in tag team and singles matches. Both men participated in the Hardcore battle royal at WrestleMania 2000 where Thrasher held the title for 43 seconds defeating Joey Abs. The team continued battling the likes of Too Cool and T & A until July 2000. After being together for six long years, they separated, and Mosh joined D'Lo Brown as Chaz to form Lo Down. Thrasher focused on his singles career and was taken off WWF TV and the main roster later that month.\n\nGlenn Ruth was released from the WWF in December 2000, after working several months in their developmental territory Power Pro Wrestling in Memphis, and Charles Warrington was released from the WWF in August 2001.\n\nYears after their departure from the company, The Headbangers have borne the brunt of criticism by WWE media. One example can be found in a 2007 article in \"WWE Magazine\" about the history of WWE champions. The article criticized wrestlers who are considered not worthy of winning a belt they held. The Headbangers were included in this article for their supposedly poor Tag Team Championship reign. The article suggested that the team had the titles by default since it was \"in between the eras of The Smoking Gunns and the New Age Outlaws.\"\n\nWWE's \"Raw 15th Anniversary\" magazine also includes a list of 15 superstars who \"overstayed\" their welcomes in the company. This has The Headbangers at #2, behind only Scott Steiner. However, in 2010 WWE added the team to their \"Where Are They Now?\" section of WWE.com.\n\nMosh and Thrasher reunited on the independent circuit in 2011. They are members of the NWA Ring Warriors roster. They wrestled for Juggalo Championship Wrestling multiple times. On August 12, 2011, The Headbangers were in the battle royal won by Zach Gowen. On December 17, 2011, The Headbangers defeated Necro Butcher and Mad Man Pondo. December 31, 2011, The Headbangers lost to Shockwave The Robot and 2 Tuff Tony. The Headbangers then lost two ten-man tag team matches while teaming with Bull Pain, Jake Manning and Colt Cabana.\n\nMosh and Thrasher appeared on the Ring of Honor pay-per-view on June 24, 2012 as the masked tag team Guardians of Truth, managed by the Truth Martini. They lost to the Briscoe Brothers. Later on, the two would unmask themselves and go on to compete as The Headbangers. They then competed on the Independent Circuit. In March 2013, both Headbangers were present during a \"WWE Smackdown\" taping. On June 18, 2013, The Headbangers defeated The South Side Playaz Club (Craig Steele and Joe Hardway) at PWS Dream on 6th Anniversary iPPV.\n\nThe Headbangers made their debut for Championship Wrestling Entertainment (CWE) competing in a triple threat match at Wrestlefest 2015. In 2016 they made their debut for Fighting Evolution Wrestling. On March 31, 2017 they defeated Cryme Tyme at Fighting Evolution Wrestling in Orlando, Florida. Later that same year they went Australia to wrestle for World Series Wrestling and feuded with The Basso Brothers.\n\nThe duo made their first appearance as a team in WWE since 2000 on the August 30, 2016 episode of \"SmackDown Live\" as heels and participants of the SmackDown Tag Team Championship tournament, losing against Heath Slater and Rhyno in the first round. They returned on the November 1 episode of \"SmackDown\", losing to The Usos in a Survivor Series qualifying match. Then they were seen again on the 15 November 900th \"SmackDown\" episode, teaming with other heel tag teams.\n\n\n"}
