{"id": "1961220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1961220", "title": "Lee Pressman", "text": "Lee Pressman\n\nLee Pressman (July 1, 1906 – November 20, 1969) was a labor attorney and earlier a US government functionary, publicly exposed in 1948 as a spy for Soviet intelligence during the mid-1930s (as a member of the Ware Group), following his recent departure from Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) as a result of its purge of Communist Party members and fellow travelers. From 1936 to 1948, he represented the CIO and member unions in landmark collective bargaining deals with major corporations including General Motors and U.S. Steel. According to journalist Murray Kempton, anti-communists referred to him as \"Comrade Big.\"\n\nPressman was born Leon Pressman on July 1, 1906, on the Lower East Side of in New York City, first of two sons of immigrants Harry and Clara Pressman of Minsk. His father was a milliner on the Lower East Side of New York City. As a child, Leon survived polio. In his teens, the family moved out to the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn. In 1922, he entered Washington Square College (absorbed into New York University), where classmates included Nathan Witt and possibly Charles Kramer (later, fellow AAA and Ware Group members), then transferred to Cornell University, where he studied under labor economist Sumner Slichter.\nIn 1926, Pressman received his bachelor's degree from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. In 1929, he received a law degree from Harvard Law School. At Harvard, he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and was in the same class as Alger Hiss. With future defending lawyer Edward Cochrane McLean, they served on the \"Harvard Law Review\":\n\nMr. Hiss: ... Lee Pressman was in my class at the Harvard Law School, and we were both on the Harvard Law Review at the same time.\n\nAfter graduation, he joined the law firm of Chadbourne, Stanchfield & Levy (currently Chadbourne & Parke) in New York City. (During the Great Depression, founder Thomas Chadbourne asserted that the capitalist system itself was \"on trial\" and became an early champion of both collective bargaining rights and profit sharing for workers.) There, he worked for Jerome Frank (future chair of the SEC). When Jerome left in 1933 to work in FDR's New Deal, Pressman joined a small firm called Liebman, Blumenthal & Levy, to handle Jerome's clients.\n\nIn 1933, Pressman joined the Ware Group at the invitation of Harold Ware, a Communist agricultural journalist in Washington, DC: \"I was asked to join by a man named Harold Ware\" (See \"Ware Group\" sub-section, below)\n\nIn July 1933, Pressman received appointment as assistant general counsel of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) by Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace. He reported to Jerome Frank, who was general counsel. The New Dealers saw the AAA as complementing the National Recovery Act (NRA – where fellow Ware Group member and lifelong Hiss friend Henry Collins worked). As they arrived at AA, two camps quickly arose: previously existing officials who favored agribusiness interests and New Deal appointees who sought to protect small farmers (and farm laborers) and consumers as much as agribusiness. Or, as Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. summarized the attitude, \"There were too many Ivy League men, too many intellectuals, too many radicals, too many Jews.\" By December 1933, Frank had hired John Abt and Arthur (or Howard) Bachrach (brother of Abt's sister Marion Abt Bachrach) to develop litigation strategies for agricultural reform policies.\n\nIn February 1935, Chester Davis fired many of Frank's cadre, including Pressman, Frank, Gardner Jackson, and two others.\n\nBy April 1935, Pressman had been appointed general counsel in the Works Progress Administration by Harry L. Hopkins. A joint resolution dated January 21, 1935, called the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, passed in the United States Congress and became law on April 8, 1935. As a result, on May 6, 1935, FDR issued Executive Order 7034, that essentially transformed the Federal Emergency Relief Administration into the Works Progress Administration. \"Pressman set to work analyzing the budget request that would transform FERA into the WPA.\"\n\nBy mid-summer 1935, Rexford G. Tugwell appointed him general counsel of the Resettlement Administration. Pressman split his time between the two agencies. However, by year's end (he recollected in a letter to Tugwell in 1937), he came to believe that New Deals changes occurred only when \"major controlling financial interests\" concurred or when \"financial interests had been able to seize effective control of the code and manipulate it to enhance their power.\"\n\nPressman left government service in the winter of 1935-36 and went into private law practice in New York City with David Scribner as Pressman & Scribner. Clients included the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association (MEBA), the United Public Workers CIO, and other unions.\n\nIn his role as the CIO's general counsel, Pressman was influential in helping to stop the attempt to deport Communist Longshoreman's Union official Harry Bridges. He continued to interact with Bridges well into June 1948, as longshoremen continued to threaten strikes on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and Bridges remained president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union.\n\nIn June 1936, he was named a counsel of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO—later AFL-CIO) for the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC—later, the United Steelworkers of America), appointed by union chief John L. Lewis as part of a conscious attempt to mobilize left-wing activists on behalf of the new labor federation. According to scholars, \"One of Pressman's unofficial roles in the CIO was liaison between the CIO's Communist faction and its predominantly non-Communist leadership.\"\n\nIn 1936-1937, he supported the Great Flint Sit-Down Strike.\n\nIn 1937, Michigan Governor William Francis Murphy supported workers rights and the nascent United Auto Workers in a sit-down strike at General Motors plants. He listened to advice Pressman that civil rights statues passed to protect African-American voters during the Civil War might grant the federal government authority to intervene in strikes in terms of Free Speech, like strikes in Harlan County, Kentucky. In February 1939, when President Roosevelt made Murphy United States Attorney General, Murphy created a Civil Liberties Unit within the criminal division of the United States Department of Justice.\n\nIn June 1938, Pressman moved back to Washington, DC, to become full-time general counsel for the CIO and the SWOC. He remained in this position for the next decade. (According to his obituary in the New York Times, he was general counsel from 1936 to 1948.)\n\nIn August 1938, Pressman criticized the American Bar Association in \"The CIO News\" in his own \"bill of particulars,\" which included the following:\n\nIn May 1939, Pressman spoke on behalf of the CIO before the US Senate's Education and Labor sub-committee to support the \"National Health Bill\" (part of the Reorganization Act of 1939), sponsored by US Senator Robert F. Wagner. He attacked the American Medical Society's position against the bill as \"reactionary,\" which he felt had kept the bill from going \"far enough.\"\n\nFrom May through August 1939, Pressman attacked support for the \"Walsh amendments\" to the 1935 National Labor Relations Act (AKA the \"Wagner Act\"). In May 1939, when AFL president William Green supported the amendments on CBS Radio, the CIO's response, penned by Pressman, accused Green of colluding with the National Association of Manufacturers against not just the CIO but also the AFL, i.e., workers. In August 1939, Pressman appeared before the Senate Labor Committee to state that Green's support did not represent AFL rank and file.\n\nAlso in August 1939, Congress passed the Hatch Act of 1939, which restricted political campaign activities by federal employees. A provision of the Hatch Act made it illegal for the federal government to employ anyone who advocated the overthrow of the federal government. The left-leaning United Public Workers of America (UFWA) immediately hired Pressman to challenge the constitutionality of the Hatch Act.\n\nIn October 1939, during a closed-door session during a CIO convention, president John L. Lewis declared his intent to rid the CIO of \"Communist influence.\" This decision came in response particularly from Philip Murray and Sidney Hillman, the CIO's two vice presidents, that pre-dated the Hitler-Stalin Pact (announced the previous month). Instead, Lewis would empower eight member of the CIO's 42 executive committee members. Further, Lewis increased the number of CIO vice presidents from two to six with: R. J. Thomas, president of the United Automobile Workers; Emil Rieve, president of the Textile Workers of America; W. J. Dalrymple, president of the United Rubber Workers; and Reid Robinson, president of the Smelter Workers. \"Left forces\" failed to have Joseph Curran, president of the National Maritime Union, elected vice president. Further, Lewis demoted Harry Bridges from West Coast CIO director to California state CIO director. The \"New York Times\" further stated:\n\nOn January 3, 1940, Pressman discussed the \"1940 Legislative Program of the CIO\" on CBS Radio. orIn his speech, Pressman said:\n\nOn pretexts of economy, more money for war purposes and similar catch cries, the reactionary financial interests and their political henchmen hope to reduce appropriations for the unemployed and for publish works, to emasculate labor and social legislation, and to restrict our civil liberties. The CIO ... calls for a determined advance in adapting social legislation to the needs of the whole American people.\n\nOn January 14, 1940, John L. Lewis retired from the CIO presidency, and Philip Murray succeeded him.\n\nOn May 18, 1940, Pressman again spoke on CBS Radio, this time on the \"Wagner Act.\"\n\nIn 1941, FDR appointed CIO vice president Sidney Hill to the Office of Production Management. Hillman lobbied for a mediating entity to OPM, and FDR created the National Defense Mediation Board (NDMB). In June 1941, NMDB and the United Auto Workers took over a North American Aviation factory during a strike. Later in June 1941, at a convention of the National Lawyers Guild in Chicago, Pressman criticized the Vinson and Ball bills before the US Congress, both of which he accused of a \"long-range\" plan whose aims included \"destruction of workers' rights to organize, bargain collectively, and strike\"; \"destruction of labor organizations as the barrier to unchecked monopoly profits\"; and \"complete control of the national economy and the government by big business.\"\n\nPressman continued to give as good as he got. In February 1940, he held a \"heated exchange\" with US Representative Clare Hatch during a hearing of the US House Labor Committee, again on the issue of amendments to the NRLA (Wagner Act):\n\nIn September 1941, Pressman received a pin from pro-Communist Mike Quill, leader of the Transport Workers Union (TWU), a CIO member, during a TWU strike. Pressman then urged TWU strikers to stand up to the New York City government, as he had four years earlier in 1937 when the TWU first left the AFL for the CIO.\n\nIn July 1942, the National War Labor Board sought advice on FDR's wage stabilization policy by increasing wages in the four \"Little Steel\" companies with a combined 157,000 employees by one dollar. CIO president Philip Murray and Pressman both supported the increase.\n\nIn July 1943, the CIO formed a political action committee, the \"CIO-PAC,\" chaired by Sidney Hillman, and supported by Pressman and John Abt as co-counsels. In his 1999 memoir, Abt, general counsel for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America under Sidney Hillman, claimed the leaders of the Communist Party of the USA had inspired the idea of the CIO-PAC:\n\nIn 1943, Gene Dennis came to me and Lee Pressman to first raise the idea of a political action committee to organize labor support for Roosevelt in the approaching 1944 election. Pressman approached Murray with the idea, as I did with Hillman. Both men seized upon the proposal with great enthusiasm.\n\nThus, in 1943, as American spy Elizabeth Bentley resurrected the Ware Group (of which Abt had been a member), could not risk involvement with her or the group. Instead, the group reformed under Victor Perlo as the Perlo Group.\n\nIn September 1943 at a conference of the National Lawyers Guild, Pressman praised labor for reducing strikes and promoting the war effort. He praised the National War Labor Board's policy for recognizing labor unions as institutions within the basic framework of our democratic society. He criticized \"selfish blocs\" in Congress that had opposed FDR's program.\n\nIn 1944, Pressman participated in resolution of a labor dispute of a national case in basic steel, involving some six hundreds unions on strike. The six-person board consisted of David L. Cole and Nathan P. Feisinger for the government, Philip Murry of the CIO with Pressman as counsel for unions, John Stevens with Chester McLain of U.S. Steel for industry.\n\nDuring 1945–1947, Pressman worked with John Abt for the CIO to help create the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) as successor to the International Federation of Trade Unions, itself seen as dominated by communist and socialist parties. During formation of the WFTU and in working with pro-Soviet American unions, \"the active role played by\" Pressman \"in writing and rewriting convention resolutions helped to smooth possible conflicts.\"\n\nIn April 1945, Pressman represented Harry Bridges before the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Bridges v. Wixon\" with the help of Carol Weiss King and her recruit, Nathan Greene who penned the brief. Later that month, Pressman joined Murray, Abt, and other CIO officials in Paris for a meeting with Soviet counterparts about the WFTU. In October 1945, he traveled to Moscow with a CIO delegation in the company of John Abt among others.\n\nOn June 6, 1946, he contributed to a broadcast entitled \"Should There Be Stricter Regulation of Labor Unions?\" on \"America's Town Meeting of the Air\" show on NBC Radio with Sen. Allen J. Ellender, Henry J. Taylor, and Rep. Andrew J. Biemiller.\n\nIn July 1946, at a National Lawyers Guild convention in Cleveland, he attacked the \"fallacious notion that increased wages in the interests of adequate purchasing power necessarily bring higher prices.\" He also attacked future Progressive Party vice presidential candidate, US Senator Glen H. Taylor, for the latter's prediction of economic uncertainty due to monopolies. He asked that an \"aroused and enlightened public\" make itself heard in Congress and in the 1946 fall elections:\n\nThis Congress has sought to stifle labor organization and at the same time has fought vigorously to assure expanded profit levels through tax and price policies. It has resisted any effort to lighten the tax burden on the lower income groups, but has acted swiftly to remove the excess-profits tax on corporations while continuing the carry-back provisions permitting gigantic tax rebates out of excess-profits tax payments of prior years.\nIn 1947, Pressman became involved in passage of the Taft-Hartley Act. In January 1947, he appeared on \"New York Times radio\" station WQXR-FM with US Senator Carl A. Hatch, former National War Labor Board chairman William Hammatt Davis, and General Precision Equipment Corporation general counsel Robert T. Rinear, to debate the topic \"Do we need new labor laws?\" While endorsing a Truman commission plan, he attacked any labor legislation passed hastily ahead of the commission's results, saying, \"Judging from the bills now before Congress, their purpose is merely to penalize labor organizations.\" Senator Hatch agreed with him that severe wage cuts in terms of real wages and increased cost of living would not find resolutions in terms of legislation that addresses only jurisdictional disputes or secondary boycotts. \"We need additional and new laws on all phases of the general problem of labor-management,\" Hatch said. Again in January 1947, on the topic of the related Portal to Portal Act of 1947, publicly before the US Senate Judiciary Committee, he urged Congress to make that act a simple authorization to employers and unions to settle portal claims through collective bargaining, while prohibiting management from attempting such settlements with individual workers at the \"economic mercy\" of employers. Further, he urged Congress to use the US Supreme Court's definition of \"work\" as activities of an employe which required physical or mental exertion for an employer's benefit and under an employer's control. Any legislation that ended portal-to-portal claims, he said, would \"most seriously undermine\" and in fact threatened \"the entire future, operation\" of the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act. Again at month's end, he attacked labor curb bills in Congress during a speech before the University of Cincinnati Lawyers Institute. He said: He also asserted that labor unions do not constitute monopolies, compared with industrial combines.\n\nIn June 1947, Pressman also wrote an influential critique of the Taft-Hartley Act, used by President Harry S. Truman as background material to justify his \"bristling\" veto of the measure. Co-sponsor, US Senator Robert A. Taft belittled Truman's veto: \"The veto message covers the Pressman memorandum which the Senator from Montana (James E. Murray) put in the record and to which I replied. The veto message substantially in detail follows the Pressman memorandum ... point by point.\" Taft's accusation drew considerable attention for days. On July 4, the \"Washington Post\"'s Drew Pearson noted \"There've been considerable charges and counter-charges that CIO Counsel Lee Pressman ghost-wrote the hot White House veto message on the Taft-Hartley labor bill. Truth is that he had no direct hand in writing the message, though some of his words did creep in.\" Pearson explained that White House Assistant Clark Clifford had penned the veto with help from William S. Tyson, solicitor of the US Labor Department, and Paul Herzog, chairman of the National Labor Relations Board – and their \"analyses\" of the bill bore striking resemblance to Pressman's analysis.\" Later on June 24, 1947, Pressman appeared again on CBS Radio with Raymond Smethurst, general counsel of NAM to discuss the effect of the new labor law. In August 1947, he gave a strong speech to the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers (IUMMSW) against the Taft-Hartley Act.\n\nIn August 1947, Pressman and Reid Robinson called for a third party to support Henry A. Wallace for U.S. President during a convention of the Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers (\"a Communist-dominated union\").\n\nBy September, the right wing of the CIO, led by Emil Rieve, claimed they were about to drive left wingers \"with Lee Pressman as the leading victim\" out of the CIO during its Fall 1947 convention.\n\nIn late 1947, Meyer Bernstein of the United Steel Workers of America wrote as an anti-communist against Pressman (amidst a rising tide led by Walter Reuther against pro-communists in the CIO).\n\nAs of 1948, James I. Loeb, co-founder of both the Union for Democratic Action (UDA) Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), stated that Pressman was \"probably was the most important Communist in the country ... he certainly was a Communist influence.\"\n\nIn early 1948, Pressman led a group of like-minded colleagues in a pitch to CIO executives to abandon Truman and the Democratic Party for Henry A. Wallace and his Progressive Party. The pitch failed. Repercussions came quickly. In late 1947, housecleaning of the CIO from communists had already begun when Len De Caux was let go by Murray.\n\nOn February 4, 1948, Pressman was \"fired from his $19,000 job as CIO general counsel, reportedly as a byproduct of a factional struggle within the federation in which anti-Communist labor leader Walter Reuther emerged triumphant. \"Time\" magazine (anti-communist) gloated, \"Lee Pressman and his Communist line are no longer popular in the C.I.O., where Walter Reuther's right wing is in ascendancy.\" (On March 4, 1948, CIO president Philip Murray announced his replacement by Arthur J. Goldberg.) Pressman went into private legal practice in New York City following his firing. In March and April 1948, however, it was clear that the CIO still used his services, even after \"firing\" him. In March 1948, he joined CIO attorneys in opposing Government attorneys, who had declared that \"the Taft-Hartley Law's ban against expenditures by labor unions in connection with Federal elections permissibly limited Constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and of the press.\" In April 1948, he represented the CIO before the Supreme Court in a case about barring of expenditures by labor unions for political purposes. (Felix Frankfurter, then Supreme Court Justice, taught at Harvard Law while Pressman was a student there.)\n\nIn March 1948, Pressman's name appeared in the \"New York Times\" as legal counsel of the Furriers Joint Board. The thousand-member Associated Fur Coat and Trimming Manufacturers, Inc., had asked for a return to pre-WWII two-season wage scheme plus compliance with affidavits from non-communist union leaders per the Taft-Hartley Act. The latter condition put pressure on two CPUSA union leaders, Ben Gold and Irving Potash. \"In a unique turn of events,\" Pressman cited a Taft-Hartley Act provision to block a lockout. He sued for a temporary injunction based on failure by employers to give 60-day lockout notice to workers, plus failure to provide thirty-day notification to Federal and state mediation services. He also helped get Potash set free on $5,000 bail while awaiting deportation hearings.\n\nPressman continued private practice. He continued to represent the MEBA, e.g., over a restraining order against strikes on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts in 1948. At the Supreme Court he represented Philip Murray (1886–1952), Scottish-born steelworker and American labor leader, first president of SWOC and USWA, and longest-serving president of the CIO.\n\nAlso in March 1948, Pressman joined a group of lawyers in defending five \"aliens\" against deportation hearings due to their Communist ties. Pressman represented all five, at least some of whom had their own attorneys: alleged Soviet spy Gerhart Eisler (represented by Abraham J. Isserman), Irving Potash of the Fur and Leather Workers Union, Ferdinand C. Smith of the National Maritime Union (Pressman); Charles A. Doyle of the Gas, Coke and Chemical Workers Union (Isadore Englander), and CPUSA labor secretary John Williamson (Carol Weiss King). Pressman went on to join Joseph Forer, a Washington-based attorney, in representing the five before the U.S. Supreme Court. On May 5, 1948, Pressman and Forer received a preliminary injunction so their defendants might have hearings with examiners unconnected with the investigations and prosecutions by examiners of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. (All attorneys were members of the National Lawyers Guild.)\n\nOn May 16, 1948, the United Public Workers read aloud their general counsel Pressman's letter, summarized by the \"New York Times\":\n\nOn May 19, 1948, Securities and Exchange Commission official Anthon H. Lund accused Pressman of interfering in a lawsuit filed against the Kaiser-Frazer car manufacturing company in a Federal District Court in New York City. He specified that between February 3 and 9, 1948, Harold J. Ruttenberg, vice president of the Portsmouth Steel Corporation, had contacted Pressman for advice on \"how to go about filing a stockholder's suite against Kaiser-Frazer.\" Later in May, during testimony before an SEC board of inquiry, Pressman declared he had \"absolutely nothing to do with\" the suit. \"I have not been requested by anyone to suggest the name of a lawyer who would file a lawsuit against the Kaiser-Frazer Corporation.\" He stated, \"I demand that I be given the opportunity to examine Mr. Lund under oath on the stand to determine who gave him that inaccurate information.\" The trial's examiner Milton P. Kroll informed Pressman, \"You have been given the opportunity to state your position on the record. Your request is denied.\"\n\nAfter passage of the Mundt-Nixon Bill on May 19, 1948, at month's end Pressman submitted a long, undated statement called \"The Mundt Control Bill (H.R. 5852), a Law to Legalize Fascism and Destroy American Democracy\" as part of proceedings by the Senate Judicial Committee on \"Control of Subversive Activities.\"\n\nDuring 1948, Pressman formed Pressman, Witt & Cammer; Bella Abzug started her career there. Since February 1948 or earlier, Witt's clients had included the Greater New York CIO Council. In September 1948, Pressman and Charles J. Margiotti tested the campaign-expenditures provision of the Taft-Hartley Act. Pressman and Margiotti each received $37,500 for their services – a fee CIO President Philip Murray called \"outrageous, even for Standard Oil.\"\n\nPressman was important enough in American politics to have Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. single him out as recent example in Schlesinger's concept of the \"Vital Center\" as first described in a long \"New York Times\" article in 1948 entitled \"Not Left, Not Right, but a Vital Center.\" In it, Schlesinger argues first that the 19th Century concept of \"linear\" spectrum Left and Right did not fit developments of the 20th Century. Rather, he promoted the \"circular\" spectrum of DeWitt Clinton Poole, in which Fascism and Nazism would meet at the circle's bottom with Soviet Communism (Leninism, Stalinism). He himself promotes the term \"Non-Communist Left\" (NCL) as an American modification of Leon Blum's Third Force. He cites as example the ascendancy of Walter Reuther in the CIO and ouster of Lee Pressman: Newspapers will doubtless continue to refer to Walter Reuther as the leader of the Right wing of the CIO, whereas, as every automobile manufacturer knows, Reuther is to the Right only in the sense of being profoundly pro-democratic and anti-Communist ... Instead of backing the Non-Communist Left as the group in Europe closest to the American progressive faith in combining freedom· and planning, the CIO, for example, maintained a disturbing silence over foreign affairs; and altogether too many liberals followed Communist cues in rejoicing at every Soviet triumph and at every Socialist discomfiture. The Wallace Doctrine of non-interference with Soviet expansion prevailed in these years. In recent months, the conception of the non-Communist Left has made headway in the United States. On the moderate Right, men like Senator Vandenberg and John Foster Dulles have recognized its validity. The fight against Communist influence in the CIO, culminating in Walter Reuther's victory in the United Auto Workers and the discharge of Lee Pressman as CIO general counsel, has finally brought the CIO side by side with the AFL in support of the Third Force in Europe. Schlesinger was carefully noting the entrance of Pressman into national politics.\nPressman became a close adviser of Progressive Party 1948 presidential candidate Henry A. Wallace. In fact, when his former AAA boss Rexford Tugwell joined the Progressive Party campaign in early 1948, \"he did so on condition that Lee Pressman would serve as its secretary.\"\n\nIn March 1948, Pressman joined a 700-member national organization in support of Henry A. Wallace for U.S. president and Glen H. Taylor for U.S. vice president.\n\nBy June 1948, the \"New York Times\" cited him as \"general counsel\" for the \"National Labor Committee for Wallace.\" \nAt the party's convention (July 23–25, 1948), Pressman served on the committee (under Rexford Tugwell, who had helped create and directed the AAA back in the early 1930s) to create a platform that the \"New York Times\" summed up as \"endorsing Red foreign policy.\"\n\nAt the time, the \"Washington Post\" dubbed Pressman, Abt, and Calvin Benham \"Beanie\" Baldwin (C. B. Baldwin) as \"influential insiders\" and \"stage managers\" in the Wallace campaign. However, he was reportedly \"forced out because of his Communist line.\"\n\nDuring the 1948 convention, the \"New York Times\" described as follows: Lee Pressman, who, for years, exerted a powerful left-wing influence as counsel for the CIO, is secretary of the Platform Committee, which will hold another executive session at 10 A. M. Friday before preparing its final draft for submission to the 2,500 delegates who are expected at the convention's closing session next Sunday.\n\nOn June 9, 1948, Pressman declared that he himself was running for public office as the candidate of the American Labor Party for U.S. Congress in the 14th District of New York (Brooklyn). In early July 1948, he registered his candidacy. He ran against Abraham J. Multer. Multer used Pressman's communist association against him early on by claiming that he had received his \"certificate of election\" from the \"Daily Worker\" (CPUSA newspaper), thanks to its condemnation of him. In July 1948, he faced condemnation from New York state's CIO head Louis Hollander, who promised to oppose Pressman's candidacy. In late August 1948, he \nIn August 1948, during the Progressive Party convention in Philadelphia, Rexford Tugwell, chairman of its platform committee found his self-style \"old-fashioned American progressive\" platform scrapped by a pro-Communist line platform spearheaded by Pressman. TIME magazine noted, \"It now seemed obvious to Tugwell that the Communists had taken over.\"\n\nIn the Fall of 1948, Communist affiliation continued to hound Pressman's campaign. A month before the election, Pressman might have held out hope, as the \"New York Times\" characterized him as a lawyer of \"wide reputation\" and a man with a \"national reputation\" and did not mention allegations in Washington. Days before the election, headlines in the Brooklyn and New York area were still appearing, like this from the \"Brooklyn Daily Eagle\": \"Pressman: Candidate for Congress, Long Active in Pro-Red Groups.\"\n\nBetween 1948 and 1950, Pressman had represented \"the estates of persons with heirs in Russia\" of interest to the Soviets as well as affairs of AMTORG.\n\nBy 1951, Pressman had only one major client left, the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association (MEBA). Its president, Herbert Daggett, retained Pressman at $10,000 (some $94,000 adjusted for 2017).\n\nIn 1933, Pressman was one of the original members of the Ware Group. He was present at its earliest known meeting. Furthermore, surmised historian Allen Weinstein, as the \"top-ranking AAA official in the Ware Group,\" he was most likely also a top recruiter of new members. Weinstein also noted that, according to Gardner Jackson, Pressman had recommended that the Nye Committee take Alger Hiss on loan.\n\nIn 1935, he left the group and Washington, DC. Of his time there, Ware Group controller J. Peters said of Pressman that he was a \"big climber\" and had a \"bad case of 'big-shotitis'.\"\n\nIn 1936, when Pressman began work as general counsel for the CIO, Peters recommended against it, as Pressman was hard to control. However, Chambers encouraged him to take the position anyway.\n\nIn 1936–1937, Chambers put Pressman in touch with Philip Rosenbliett and \"Mack Moren\" to travel to Mexico and buy arms for \"J. Eckhart,\" a representative of the Loyalists in the Spanish Civil War.\n\nIn 1939, former underground Communist Whittaker Chambers privately identified Pressman to Assistant Secretary of State Adolf Berle as a member of a so-called \"Ware group\" of Communist government officials supplying information to the secret Soviet intelligence network.\n\nIn the 1940s, the FBI investigated Pressman and other Communists. On October 31, 1943, during a CIO convention in Philadelphia, the FBI recorded conversations of Roy Hudson, then CPUSA labor secretary. Hudson met with CIO union leaders (including Harry Bridges). On November 5, they heard identified the voice of a man whom Hudson instructed on Party demands for changes in the CIO platform: the name was Lee Pressman. Pressman's meetings continued with Hudson into September 1944.\n\nHistorian Robert H. Zieger held that Pressman was no longer a communist by the time he joined the CIO. Instead, he claimed that Pressman was important to the CIO because he \"retained close ties with the CPUSA.\"\n\nOn August 3, 1948, in testimony under subpoena before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), Chambers identified Pressman as a member of the Ware group.\n\nOn August 4, Pressman characterized Chambers' testimony as \"smearing me with the stale and lurid mouthings of a Republican exhibitionist who was bought by Henry Luce.\" By using Chambers, he claimed, HUAC sought to achieve three objectives: distract Americans from \"the real issues\" (civil rights, inflation, housing, Israel, and repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act), smear FDR's New Deal officials, and discredit Henry Wallace and his associates.\"\n\nOn August 20, 1948, in testimony under subpoena before the HUAC, Pressman declined to answer questions regarding Communist Party membership, citing grounds of potential self-incrimination.\n\nDuring the superheated political environment which surrounded the Korean War, Pressman seems to have stepped back from his previous communist affinities. In 1950, Pressman resigned from the American Labor Party because of \"Communist control of that organization,\" which was reported in the press and which signaled HUAC that Pressman was at last ready to talk.\n\nCalled again before Congress to give testimony on Communist Party activities, on August 28, 1950, Pressman reversed his previous decision to exercise his Fifth Amendment rights and gave testimony against his former comrades. Pressman stated: In my desire to see the destruction of Hitlerism and an improvement in economic conditions here at home, I joined a Communist group in Washington, D. C, about 1934. My participation in such group extended for about a year, to the best of my recollection. I recall that about the latter part of 1935— the precise date I cannot recall, but it is a matter of public record — I left the Government service and left Washington to reenter the private practice of law in New York City. And at that time I discontinued any further participation in the group from that date until the present. He stated that he had no information about the political views of his former law school classmate Alger Hiss and specifically denied that Hiss was a participant in this Washington group. He indicated that in at least one meeting of his group, perhaps two, he had met Soviet intelligence agent J. Peters. Although he made no mention of having himself conducted intelligence-gathering activities, his 1950 testimony provided the first corroboration of Chambers' allegation that a Washington, DC communist group around Ware existed, with federal officials Nathan Witt, John Abt and Charles Kramer named as members of this party cell.\n\nTIME magazine mocked Pressman in its reportage in the issue following his hearing: Like many another smart young man who followed the Communist line, sharp-eyed, sharply dressed Attorney Lee Pressman did very well for a long time. Har-vardman Pressman launched his leftward-turning career in Henry Wallace's AAA back in 1933, ended up as chief counsel of the CIO. He held the post for twelve years. But though he was a skilled labor lawyer, his fellow-traveling finally became too much for Phil Murray; 2½ years ago, Murray tearfully threw him out. <br> His star did not entirely wane. He became a power among the back-room Reds who steered Henry Wallace through the presidential campaign. But when the Korean war began, he, like Wallace, began slipping away from his Commie cronies. California's Congressman Richard Nixon, scenting opportunity, decided to call him before the House Un-American Activities Committee and ask him a few questions. (Once before, when Whittaker Chambers named Pressman as a member of the same elite apparatus as Alger Hiss, Pressman had taken refuge in the Fifth Amendment, refused to answer Congressmen's questions.) <br> Last week, Pressman decided to reverse his field... <br> This week ... he reluctantly consented to name three men who had been fellow Communists in the '30s—John Abt, Nathan Witt and Charles Kramer... \n\nOn June 28, 1931, Pressman married the former Sophia Platnik. The couple had three daughters.\n\nHe was a member of the International Juridical Association (IJA) (\"probably through Shad Polier who was a classmate of mine at law school\"), the National Lawyers Guild (NLG), and the New York Bar Association. According to biographer Gilbert J. Gall, Pressman, Witt, and others formed the \"radical\" wing of the NLG against a more moderate, liberal wing lead by NLG president Morris Ernst (also co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union).\n\nIn 1957, he stated during an interview:\n\nI don't think today's generation has nearly as exciting a life as we did when we were in our twenties, but I suppose it's the times. It seems to me that the labor movement with all the strength it has nowadays should be able to organize several million unorganized workers.\n\nPressman died at home at 26 Forster Avenue in Mt. Vernon, New York, on November 20, 1969. Sophia Platnik Pressman (Cornell '28) died on May 12, 1980, in Sandia Park, New Mexico.\n\n\"Showing men in power how to get things done legally\" was Pressman's special skill, asserts historian Gilbert J. Gall in a biography of Pressman.\n\nTIME magazine (never a friend of Pressman's) wrote at his death: Died. Lee Pressman, 63, the C.I.O.'s legal counsel from 1936 until 1948, when his far-left politics finally cost him his job and career; of cancer; in Mt. Vernon, N.Y. Pressman never made any bones about his Communist leanings, often supporting the Moscow line. Yet as a union lawyer he was tops; he played a major role in negotiating the original C.I.O. contracts with such industrial giants as U.S. Steel and General Motors, and ably fought labor cases before the Supreme Court. In 1948, \"the first of a series of reports on Communists and Pro-Communists for Wallace\" summarized Pressman's role in both the CIO and the 1948 presidential campaign as follows: \n\nPressman's VENONA codename was \"Vig.\"\n\nIn 1946, VENONA reveals that Pressman hosted Mikhail Vavilov, first secretary in the Soviet embassy, at his home in Washington, DC, where he met fellow (former) Ware Group member Charles Kramer.\n\nIn 1948, Anatoly Gorsky, former chief of Soviet intelligence operations in the United States, listed Pressman, code-named \"Vig–Lee Pressman, former legal adviser of the Congress of Industrial Organizations\" among the Soviet sources likely to have been identified by US authorities, as a result of the defection of Soviet courier Elizabeth Bentley three years earlier.\n\nIn 1949, VENONA reveals that the KGB used Pressman to pay Victor Perlo for \"analysis.\" In 1950, it reported \"Vig–covering the activities of the Progressive Party.\" In 1951, Pressman served as \"conduit\" to pay funds to Harold Glasser.\n\nIn 1951, VENONA reveals that Soviet intelligence in Washington reported to Moscow, \"Vig has chosen to betray us.\"\n\nFollowing the fall of the Soviet Union, archival information on Soviet espionage activity in America began to emerge. Working in Soviet intelligence archives in the middle 1990s, Russian journalist Alexander Vassiliev discovered that Pressman, codenamed \"Vig,\" had told only fragments of the truth to Congressional inquisitors in 1950. Working with historians John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, Vassiliev revealed that Pressman had actually remained \"part of the KGB's support network\" by providing legal aid and funneling financial support to exposed intelligence assets. As late as September 1949, Soviet intelligence had paid $250 through Pressman to Victor Perlo for an analysis of the American economic situation, followed by an additional $1000 in October.\n\nA 1951 Soviet intelligence report indicated that \"Vig\" had \"chosen to betray us,\" apparently a reference to his 1950 public statements and Congressional testimony. Historians Haynes, Klehr, and Vassiliev indicate that the assessment was an overstatement, however. With his carefully limited testimony before HUAC and in his unpublicized interviews with the Federal Bureau of Investigation it is instead charged that Pressman:\n\n... Sidestepped most of his knowledge of the early days of the Communist underground in Washington and his own involvement with Soviet intelligence, first with Chambers's GRU network in the 1930s and later with the KGB. He had never been the classic 'spy' who stole documents. Neither his work in domestically oriented New Deal agencies in the early 1930s nor his later role as a labor lawyer gave him access to information of Soviet interest. Instead, he functioned as part of the KGB espionage support network, assisting and facilitating its officers and agents. He gambled that there would not be anyone to contradict his evasions and that government investigators would not be able to charge him with perjury. He won his bet ...\n\nPressman left one posthumously published memoir, a microfiche transcript of a Columbia University oral history interview:\n\n\n\n\n"}

It has the habit of a robust shrub with a spherical or bottle-shaped trunk. It has several cylindrical branches at the top.\n\nThis plant is endemic to Madagascar, where it grows in open deciduous forest on Mesozoic calcareous rock and granite or gneiss on the western side of the island at low elevations. It is known in Madagascar as \"Bontaka\". It is also endemic from Befandriana Nord to Mandritsara.\n\nConstantin and Bois first described \"Pachypodium baronii\" as a species of the genus \"Pachypodium\" in 1907.\n\n\"Pachypodium baronii\" is a robust, globose (spherical)- to bottle-shaped shrub in habit. Its trunk is subglobose, not quite globose or spherical, mostly narrowed at the base with dimensions of in length by by . At the top of the trunk, it abruptly narrows into one or several cylindrical branches that are to by by in diameter, tapering to to in diameter.\n\n\"Pachypodium baronii\" typically grows to high. Its bark is colored pale grey or grey-green and is smooth, but sometimes retains remnants of leaf scars. Branchlets are to in length by in width. They are covered with paired often curved spines that measure long to in diameter at the base of the branchlet. Its basal (lower) part of the branchlet is conical and laterally compressed at 0.33 to 0.66 times the spine's length. The spines are often red and pubescent, hairy when young, turning medium to dark brown and glabrous and smooth.\n\nThe leaves of \"Pachypodium baronii\" are confined to the apices of the branchlets. The leaves are petiolate, meaning that they bear a stalk that attaches to the stem and to the leaf blade. The petiole is a pale reddish-green about long. It is pubescent, or hairy-like. The blade is coriaceous, leathery, and medium green. It has a midrib that is above pale green and shiny and beneath pale and glaucous, smooth without hairs. The pale green midrib and dark green reticulate venation is visible when the blade is fresh. When dried, the blade is papery, ovate to obovate or narrowly so, and 1.4 to 3 times as long as it is wide. Therefore, the leaf measures to in length by to h). It is acuminate, tapering gradually to a sharp point, to apiculate, ending abruptly with a sharp, flexible tip at the apex and wedged-shape or cuneate to rounded at the base. The leaf's margin is revolute, rolled backward from the tip or margins to the undersurface, glabrous to sparsely pubescent above. Beneath it is pubescent especially on midrib and secondary veins as well as the impressed of venation. As well, underneath the leaf, the midrib and secondary veins are very prominent. The secondary veins are in 15 to 30 pairs, straight, upcurved at the apex, and forming an angle of 45–90° with the costa--\"the rib, ridge, or especially the mid-rib, for instance, of a leaf.\" The tertiary, or third level of venation is reticulate, netted or showing a net like structure or pattern.\n\nThe inflorescence of \"Pachypodium baronii\" is pedunculate, having a main axis to flower stalk. The inflorescence is congested, measures 16 cm (inch) by 40 (inch) in length by 40 cm (1.58-inch) to 4.5 cm (1.77-inch) to 12 cm (0.47-inch), and have 3 to 17 flowers. The inflorescence's peduncle, the stalk of an inflorescence or a stalk bearing a solitary flower in a one-flowered inflorescence, is pale green and terete, cylindrical but usually slightly tapering at both ends. It measures 7 mm (0.276-inch) to 20 mm (0.787-inch) in length by 4 mm (0.157-inch) to 6 mm (0.236-inch). The peduncle, as well, is glabrescent. The pedicels are pale reddish-green, 8 mm (0.315-inch) to long, and sparsely pubescent and hairy. The bracts` of \"P. baronii\" are oblong and 2 to 3.5 times as long as wide, thus 5 mm (0.197-inch) to 11 mm (0.433-inch) in length by 2 mm (.078-inch) to 2.5 mm (0.098-inch). The bracts are longer than the sepals and are pubescent, hairy outside, glabrous, smooth, without hairs inside.\n\nThe sepals of \"Pachypodium baronii\" are no different than most sepals in other flowering plants (angiosperms) in forming an outer floral envelop. In \"P. baronii\"'s case, the sepals are dark green, connate at the base for about 0.2 mm (.008 (0.098-inch), persistent until maturity of the flower, and ovate or narrowly so. They measure 1.5–2.5 times as long as they are wide at 2.5 mm (inch) to 6 mm (inch) in length by 1.5 mm (0.059-inch) to 2.5 mm (0.098-inch). They are acuminate at the apex and glabrous, smooth, to sparsely pubescent, slightly hairy, outside and glabrous inside.\n\nThe collective term for all the petals of a flower or the inner whorl of the perianth; the corolla of \"Pachypodium baronii\" is limb and crimson with a corolla tube. The basal part of the corolla tube, the part of the corolla where the petals are united to form a funnel shaped cylinder, is pale green, whereas the upper part is part greenish-red outside and inside pale yellow or pale green. Inside these colors are shaped like a star or ring in pattern. They are surrounded by a dark red throat, measuring 2.5 cm (inch) to 4 cm (inch) long in the mature bud. The corolla tube forms a comparatively wide and broadly ovoid, broad and rounded at the base and tapering toward the end, head that measures 0.4 to 0.5 times the tube's length, thus, at 1 cm (0.39-inch) to 1.9 cm (0.75-inch) long by 0.7 cm (0.28-inch) to 1.1 cm (0.43-inch) wide. At the apex, the bud is acuminate, tapering gradually to a sharp point, to obtuse, having a blunt or rounded tip. Whereas it is (I) glabrous or sparsely pubescent to often partly pubescent outside, inside it is (II) glabrous on the part of the lobes covering the bud and glabrous for 6 mm (0.236-inch) to 7 mm (0.276-inch) from the base. A pubescent belt located inside the corolla tube is 4 mm (0.158-inch) to 7 mm (0.276-inch) below the insertion of the stamens, the male reproductive organ of a flower, to the mouth. The mouth is more densely pubescent and hairy. The corolla tube is 4.4 to 6 times as long as the calyx, which is 1.13 to 1.22 times as long as the corolla lobes. Therefore, the corolla tube is 15 mm (inch) to 23 mm (inch) long. Its basal part is almost cylindrical, but often conically widened at the base. It is 0.39 to 0.44 times the length of the entire tube at 7 mm (0.276-inch) to 9 mm (0.354-inch) long by 2 mm (0.079-inch) to 4.8 mm (0.189-inch) wide. The upper part is almost cylindrical at 8 mm (0.315-inch) to 14 mm (0.551-inch) long. It slightly narrows at the mouth to be 3 mm (0.118-inch) to 4 mm (0.158-inch) wide. The corolla lobes are obliquely and broadly obovate, egg-shaped and flat with the narrow end attached to the stalk, at 0.8 to 0.9 times as long as the tube, hence measuring at 1.35 to 1.6 times as long as it is wide at 15 mm (0.591-inch) to 19 mm (0.75-inch) long by 11 mm (0.43-inch) to 17 mm (0.67-inch) wide. The lobes are rounded at their apex and ciliate at the edge, or margin.\n\nWith an apex 4 mm (0.158-inch) to 4.5 mm (0.177-inch) below the mouth of the corolla tube, \"Pachypodium baronii's\" stamens are inserted at 0.47 to 0.6 the length of the corolla tube. It measures at 1.0 cm (0.394-inch) to 1.4 cm (0.551-inch) from the base. The stamen is the male reproductive organ of a flower where it usually has a filament and, at least, an anther. A filament is usually thin short or elongated stalk of the stamen that carries the anther at the upper end; whereas the anther is the part of the stamen that bear the pollen. In \"baronii,\" the anthers are very narrowly triangular at 5 to 6 times as long as wide, measuring 6 mm (0.236-inch) to 6.5 mm (0.256-inch) in length by 1.0 mm (0.039-inch) to 1.3 mm (0.051-inch) wide. They are pubescent inside at the base of the connective, the sterile part of the anther as opposed to the theca, which is the part of the anther that carries pollen, and are just below where the anther occurs with the pistil head, part of the female reproductive organ in a flower.\n\nThe pistil is the female reproductive organ of a flower that is composed of an ovary and several free carpels the style and the stigma. A carpel is the modified leaf that contains the ovules and has a style and a stigma on top. The style is the stalk-like portion that connects the stigma and the carpel or ovary; whereas the stigma, itself, is the top most receptive region of the style, commonly divided. In \"Pachypodium baronii\" the pistil is 12.5 mm (0.49-inch) to 14.5 mm (0.57-inch) long. The ovary measures 2 mm (0.078-inch) to 2.5 mm (0.098-inch) long by 1.8 mm (0.071-inch) to 2.2 mm (0.87-inch) wide by 1.5 mm (0.059-inch) high. It is pubescent on the part not covered by the disk, a disk-like structure that secretes nectar. In \"P. baronii\", the disk is composed of five unequal glands, where 2 or 2 pairs are fused partly or entirely. These glands are ovate and measure 1.7 mm (0.067-inch) to 2 mm (0.079-inch) high. They are rounded at the apex and are more than half as long as the ovary. The style is 9.3 mm (0.37-inch) to 11 mm (0.43-inch) long and sparsely pubescent. The pistil head is cylindrical and is at 1.0 mm (.039-inch) to 1.3 mm (0.51-inch) high. It is composed of an obconical, inverted conical shape, basal part, which is 0.5 mm (0.020-inch) to 0.65 mm (0.26-inch) long by 0.4 mm (0.016-inch) to 0.5 mm (0.020-inch) wide. The pistil has a ring-shaped central part measuring 0.5 mm (0.020-inch) to 0.7 mm (0.028-inch) long by 0.6mm (0.024-inch) to 0.7 mm (0.028-inch). It has a stigmoid apex 0.1 mm (0.004-inch) to 0.2 mm (0.008-inch) by to 0.4 mm (0.016-inch). The ovules are approximately 50 in each carpel.\n\nThe fruit of \"Pachypodium baronii\" is made up of 2 separate mericarps, the part of the ovary or carpel that has one or more enclosed seeds. Sometimes only one fruit develops with an angle of 45–180° at the base. Sometimes flowers and fruit are on the same inflorescence. The mericarps are pale reddish-green with longitudinal lines when fresh and when dried pale brown to pale greenish-brown to dark brown outside and whitish to very pale brown inside. The fruit measures 40 mm (1.58-inch) to 115 mm (4.53-inch) long by 10 mm (0.39-inch) to wide by 7 mm (0.28-inch) to 10 mm (0.39-inch) high. When the fruit is fresh it is either straight or recurved, obtuse to acute at the apex. It is pubescent and has a wall 1 mm (inch) thick.\n\nThe seed of \"Pachypodium baronii\" is pale brown with margin medium brown when fresh. It is ovate to elliptic at 6 mm (0.236-inch) to 7 mm (0.256-inch) by 3 mm (0.118-inch) to 3.8 mm (0.150-inch). It is rounded at the apex, obtuse at the base, and has a margin that is revolute towards the hilar side. The testa is smooth. The coma is straw-colored and at 1 cm (0.39-inch) to 1.5 cm (0.59-inch) long. The embryo is whitish at 5 mm (0.197-inch) by 6 mm (0.236-inch) long. The cotyledons are ovate and 1.14 to 1.2 times as long as it is wide at 3 mm (0.118-inch) to 4 mm (0.158-inch) long by 2.5 mm (0.98-inch) to 3.5 mm (0.138-inch) wide. They are rounded at the apex and cordate at the base with a rootlet 0.6 to 0.8 times as long as the cotyledons at 2 mm (0.079-inch) to long by 1.0 mm (0.039-inch) to 1.8 mm (0.071-inch) wide.\n\n\"Pachypodium baronii\" is found on three different substrate, where two are similar and one is not. It can be located on mainly steep gneiss but sometimes granite rocks (metamorphic basement) and Mesozoic calcareous rock. \"metamorphic basement\" means a geological complex of undifferentiated igneous and metamorphic rocks where the rocks themselves have altered their composition, texture, or internal structure through extreme heat, pressure, and the introduction of a chemical. Granite and gneiss, in this condition of being undifferentiated, tend to have an acidi pH level; whereas calcareous rock tends to be more basic. This flexibility in substrate demonstrates a less specialized geological environment. These steep rocks are often located in low open dry, xeric deciduous western forests where they take advantage of micro-environments suitable for succulents. Micro-environments means a delimited convergence of very localize landscape and climate conditions that are in stark contrast to the larger vegetative climatic environmental zone. \"Pachypodium baronii\" prefers open sunlight but will tolerate some indirect light conditions because they inhabit open deciduous forests. They grow at an altitude between 300 m (feet) to 1200 m (feet) . Other vegetative types, often site indicators of micro-environments, are associated with \"P. baronii\" in habitats, such as \"Pachypodium sofiense\" Apocynaceae, \"Uncarina\" sp., (Pedialaceae) \"Aloe\" \"bulbillifera\" (Asphodelaceae), \"Euphorbia\" \"milii\" (Euphorbaceae), \"Kalanchoe\" \"gastonis-bonieri\" (Crassulaceae), and \"Urera\" sp. (Urticaceae).\n\nThe substrate for \"Pachypodium baronii\" in cultivation is an acidic loose peat mixed with gneiss sand at a pH level of 4. Temperatures from spring to autumn, day and night are respectively . In the winter, night and day temperatures should range from or more. It will after four years of growth flower profusely in the spring. As well, it needs a larger pot size than other \"Pachypodium\" species. It water regime is to water a lot during growing season and very little during the resting time only to prohibit drying out of roots. Propagation is by seeds.\n\nThe botanist team qua \"team\" of Costantin and Bois is not listed in the publication section of the Online Database of Harvard University Herbaria. so other records will need to be examined. The Harvard University Herbaria does; however, list each botanist separately so that it is easy to discern their identities.\n\nNote: Name of Botanist and some full names of journals is taken from the Online Database Harvard University Herbaria.\n\nAgain Harvard University Herbaria does not list \"Constantin & Bois\" as a team who worked together. Yet each member; however, is listed separately.\nThe Species Type is : Madagascar, sin. loc., \"Baron\" 5874 (holotype P; isotype K). fig. 1, p. 11; Map 1, p. 12; Plates 2–4, opposite p. 16.\n\nAlong this history of \"Pachypodium baronii\" a variety of the species was published in 1924 by the name \"Pachypodium baronii\" var. \"erythreum.\" by the botanist \"Henri Louis Poisson\", author name \"Poiss.\", within the abbreviated name for the journal \"Bull. Acad. Malgache.\" sér. 2, 6: 166, pl. 10 (1924). Its Species Type: Madagascar, Antsiranana, Upper Sofia R., Antsakabary, \"Perrier de la Bâthie\" 15082 (holotype P). \"Rapanarivo et al.\" and apparently others have considered it a synonym for \"Pachypodium baronii.\"\n\n"}

Directed by John Huston, it was produced by Gottfried Reinhardt with Dore Schary as executive producer. The screenplay is by John Huston, adapted by Albert Band from Stephen Crane's novel of the same name. The cinematography is by Harold Rosson, and the music score by Bronislau Kaper. The making of this film is the subject of Lillian Ross's 1952 book \"Picture\", originally in \"The New Yorker\". \nThe American Civil War film is a sparse but faithful retelling of the story, incorporating narration from the text to move the plot forward. Audie Murphy, a hero of World War II who later went into acting, played the lead role of Henry Fleming. Other actors include cartoonist Bill Mauldin, Andy Devine, Arthur Hunnicutt and Royal Dano.\n\nThe plot is based on the book with fewer bloody details. A regiment of Union soldiers head South to engage Confederate forces. Joining them is Henry Fleming (Audie Murphy), a green private sent into battle for the first time. He is unprepared for the fight, but by the time battle breaks out, he finds his endurance and courage tested.\n\n\nDirector John Huston used unusual compositions and camera angles drawn from film noir to create an alienating battlefield environment. He became frustrated when the studio cut the film's length to 70 minutes and added narration following supposedly poor audience test screenings.\nMuch of the history of the making of this film, considered by some a mutilated masterpiece, is found in Lillian Ross' critically acclaimed book \"Picture\". Of the stars who appear in the film, three served in World War II: Bill Mauldin the editorial cartoonist who created \"Up Front\", Audie Murphy served with the U.S. Army in Europe, and narrator James Whitmore served with the U.S. Marine Corps.\n\nThe film is available on DVD.\n\nJohn Huston had high hopes for this movie, even considered the original two-hour cut of the film as the best he had ever made as a director. After a power struggle at the top of MGM management, the film was cut from a two-hour epic to the 69-minute version released to theaters in response to its alleged universally disastrous previews. It never was released as an \"A\" feature but was shown as a second-feature \"B\" picture. Both Huston and star Audie Murphy tried unsuccessfully to purchase the film so that it could be re-edited to its original length. Huston did not waste any time fighting over it because he was focused on the pre-production of his next picture, \"The African Queen\". The studio claimed that the cut footage was destroyed, probably in the 1965 MGM vault fire. Huston later was asked by MGM in 1975 if he had an original cut because the studio wanted to release it. He actually had struck a 16mm print, but by that time, it had been lost.\n\nAccording to MGM records, the film earned $789,000 in the US and Canada and $291,000 in other countries, resulting in a loss of $1,018,000. This made it one of the studio's least successful films of the year although it did not lose as much money as \"Calling Bulldog Drummond\", \"Mr Imperium\" or \"Inside Straight\".\n\n\n\n"}

He had been influenced by his brother's ability to attract attention by playing the guitar.\n\nHe did his schooling from St. Xavier's School, Delhi in 1981, and graduation from Hansraj College.\n\nA self-taught musician, Sen started the band, \"Indian Ocean\", with Late Asheem Chakravarty in 1990. They were joined by Rahul Ram in 1991, and in 1991 by multi-instrumentalist Amit Kilam completing the quartet. Using Indian rhythms, melodies and folk music influences the band created a unique sound and soon achieved success; in following decades produced five studio albums, and a live album, \"Desert Rain\". Besides this a concert DVD, \"Indian Ocean Live In Concert\" of their two-hour live concert at the Garden of Five Senses in Delhi was released in 2008. \"Leaving Home – the Life & Music of Indian Ocean\" (2010) directed by Jaideep Varma, it became the first band ever in India to be subject of a documentary. At the 58th National Film Awards, the documentary went on to win the Award for Best Arts/Cultural Film.\n\nFounder member, Chakrvarty died suddenly in 2009, due to heart attack. Sen released his first solo debut album \"Depths of the Ocean\" in 2011, an album which had been in the making for the last ten years. Featuring collaboration with Shubha Mudgal, Nitin Malik, Papon, and Asheem Chakravarty. In 2012, he started touring with a new setup of artistes, called \"The Susmit Sen Chronicles\", which included drummer Nikhil Vasudevan, bassist Anirban Ghosh, tabla player Varun Gupta and vocalists Amit Sharma and Sudhir Rikhari. Thereafter Sen left Indian Ocean in June 2013, to pursue his solo career. However, he joined the Indian Ocean for a farewell tour in end 2013, thereafter he was replaced by guitarist Nikhil Rao.\n\nEarly, 2014 saw the release of an eponymously titled coffee table photography book on the group's history. As a tribute, the Dehradun Guitar Company has created the SS Series of Guitars named after Susmit Sen. He started work on his second solo-album in October 2013 and completed it in following March. In July 2014, the album \"Ocean to Ocean\" was released, which also featured a collaborative track with Bernie Marsden, the former Whitesnake guitarist. Later in the year he released his memoir, \"Ocean to Ocean: A Memoir\" co-written with Sehba Imam. In its 2014 listing of \"25 Greatest Indian Rock Songs of the last 25 Years\", \"Rolling Stone India\" featured two songs, \"Ma Rewa\" and \"Kandisa\" from the album, \"Kandisa\" (2000).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1961267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1961267", "title": "John Abt", "text": "John Abt\n\nJohn Jacob Abt (May 1, 1904 – August 10, 1991) was an American lawyer and politician, who spent most of his career as chief counsel to the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) and was accused of membership in the Communist Party and the \"Ware Group\" alleged by Whittaker Chambers to be a Soviet spy network. Abt denied that the group was a spy ring, noting that the security classification system did not yet exist, and none of the documents he had access to involved national security.\n\nAbt was born on May 1, 1904 in Chicago, Illinois. He was a graduate of the University of Chicago, and from its law school.\n\nAbt practiced real estate and corporate law in Chicago from 1927 to 1933.\n\nAbt was the Chief of Litigation, Agricultural Adjustment Administration from 1933 to 1935, assistant general counsel of the Works Progress Administration in 1935 (where Lee Pressman was also working), chief counsel to Senator Robert La Follette, Jr.'s Committee from 1936 to 1937 and special assistant to the United States Attorney General, 1937 and 1938.\n\nFrom 1938 to 1948, he worked at chief counsel of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union under Sidney Hillman, who hired him. By this time, the ACW had affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).\nIn his memoir, Abt claimed that leaders of the Communist Party of the USA had inspired the idea of the CIO-PAC:\n\nIn 1943, Gene Dennis came to me and Lee Pressman to first raise the idea of a political action committee to organize labor support for Roosevelt in the approaching 1944 election. Pressman approached Murray with the idea, as I did with Hillman. Both men seized upon the proposal with great enthusiasm.\n\nAbt and Pressman became the CIO-PAC's co-counsels. (Thus, in 1943, as American spy Elizabeth Bentley resurrected the Ware Group [of which Abt had been a member], Abt could not risk involvement with her or the group. Instead, the group reformed without him under Victor Perlo as the Perlo Group.)\n\nBy January 1946, he was also working as general counsel for the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and traveled to Russia with a CIO delegation, which included Lee Pressman. (The CIO had long-term support from communists; in 1947, CIO leaders like Walter Reuther pushed out communist elements and again in 1949 after the CIO's merger with the American Federation of Labor [AFL] to form the AFL-CIO.)\n\nIn September 1946, Abt appeared on the New York state ticket of American Labor Party candidates: Benjamin Fielding for Lieutenant Governor, Harry J. Chapman for State Controller, Joseph Lucchi for Attorney General, John T. Loughran for Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, and John Abt for Associate Judge of the Court of Appeals.\n\nIn October 1946, he (as CIO general counsel) joined other \"liberal and progressive groups\" in forming the new Progressive Party.\n\nIn February 1948, Abt left the Amalgamated and Pressman left the CIO to go work for the Progressive Party to support its presidential candidate, former Vice President Henry A. Wallace. At the time, the \"Washington Post\" dubbed Abt, Lee Pressman, and Calvin Benham \"Beanie\" Baldwin (C. B. Baldwin) as \"influential insiders\" and \"stage managers\" in the Wallace campaign. He also supported the candidacy in New York of Vito Marcantonio, a leader of the American Labor Party.\n\nFrom 1951 to 1953, Abt joined Vito Marcantonio and Joseph Forer in defending the CPUSA on a charge from the McCarran Act.\n\nIn January 1955 Abt defended Claude Lightfoot in Chicago, an African-American Communist on trial under the 1940 Smith Act for belonging to a group that advocates the overthrow of the US government. This trial marked the first time the government attempted to convict an individual solely as a member of a group conspiring against the nation, rather than for individual actions. Although Abt's short and simple defense did not succeed at this trial, Lightfoot's conviction was ultimately overturned by the US Supreme Court in 1964.\n\nIn 1960, Abt again defended the CPUSA before the U.S. Supreme Court on the constitutionality of the McCarran Act. In 1961, however, the Court sustained the section of the act requiring Communist-action organizations to register with the Government by a vote of five to four.\n\nDuring Lee Harvey Oswald's interrogation by the Dallas Police on the evening of 22 November 1963, pending his arraignment for the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, he requested the services of Mr. Abt:\n\nI want that attorney in New York, Mr. Abt. I don't know him personally but I know about a case that he handled some years ago, where he represented the people who had violated the Smith Act, [which made it illegal to teach or advocate the violent overthrow of the U.S. government] ... I don't know him personally, but that is the attorney I want. ... If I can't get him, then I may get the American Civil Liberties Union to send me an attorney.\n\nHowever, Abt and his wife had left New York City that day for a weekend at their cabin in Connecticut. He did not learn of Oswald's request until the following day. He told reporters that he had received no request either from Oswald or from anyone on his behalf to represent him, and so was in no position to give a definite answer. He said later that \"if I were requested to represent him, I felt that it would probably be difficult, if not impossible, for me to do so because of my commitments to other clients.\"\n\nIn 1965, the Supreme Court ruled that individuals may invoke their constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and refuse to register with the Government as members of the US Communist Party. Abt considered this decision as his greatest legal victory.\nAbt was one of the first attorneys to represent Angela Davis for her alleged involvement in the 1970 Marin County courthouse incident. Margaret Burnham worked with him and later wrote a foreword to his memoir.\n\nAbt was also a member of the Ware Group, a covert organization of Communist Party operatives within the United States government in the 1930s, which actively aided Soviet intelligence by passing on government information, as well as furnishing assistance to members of the CPUSA. Abt's sister, Marion Bachrach, was also a member of the group. After the group's founder, Harold Ware, was killed in an automobile collision in 1935, Abt married Jessica Smith, Ware's widow.\n\nIn late 1943, Jacob Golos, who headed the CPUSA's secret apparatus, was referred to a spy ring of party members by General Secretary of the party, Earl Browder. This ring had been engaged for some time in espionage for Browder, and held regular clandestine meetings at Abt's apartment. In early 1944, Golos sent Elizabeth Bentley to make contact with the group at Abt's apartment. In attendance was Abt, Victor Perlo, Charles Kramer, Harry Magdoff and Edward Fitzgerald. They discussed paying party dues to Bentley, the various types of information each would be able to deliver, and the type of information other members not in attendance would also be willing to deliver.\n\nIn late 1943, the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation of Abt. Its surveillance showed frequent meetings in the early months of 1944 between Abt and a man then known as Alexander Stevens, one of the several pseudonyms used by the shadowy J. Peters, a party 'enforcer' who at one time headed the CPUSA's secret apparatus, and was involved in clandestine Soviet intelligence activities in the U.S., until his deportation to Hungary in 1948.\n\nIn 1948, under subpoena before HUAC, Whittaker Chambers named Abt among members of the Ware Group. Abt refused to give testimony.\n\nCalled again before Congress to give testimony on Communist Party activities, on August 28, 1950, Lee Pressman reversed his previous decision to exercise his Fifth Amendment rights and gave testimony against his former comrades. Pressman stated: In my desire to see the destruction of Hitlerism and an improvement in economic conditions here at home, I joined a Communist group in Washington, D. C, about 1934. My participation in such group extended for about a year, to the best of my recollection. I recall that about the latter part of 1935— the precise date I cannot recall, but it is a matter of public record — I left the Government service and left Washington to reenter the private practice of law in New York City. And at that time I discontinued any further participation in the group from that date until the present. He stated that he had no information about the political views of his former law school classmate Alger Hiss and specifically denied that Hiss was a participant in this Washington group. He indicated that in at least one meeting of his group, perhaps two, he had met Soviet intelligence agent J. Peters. Although he made no mention of having himself conducted intelligence-gathering activities, his 1950 testimony provided the first corroboration of Chambers' allegation that a Washington, DC communist group around Ware existed, with federal officials Nathan Witt, John Abt and Charles Kramer named as members of this party cell.\n\nTIME magazine mocked Pressman in its reportage in the issue following his hearing: Like many another smart young man who followed the Communist line, sharp-eyed, sharply dressed Attorney Lee Pressman did very well for a long time. Har-vardman Pressman launched his leftward-turning career in Henry Wallace's AAA back in 1933, ended up as chief counsel of the CIO. He held the post for twelve years. But though he was a skilled labor lawyer, his fellow-traveling finally became too much for Phil Murray; 2½ years ago, Murray tearfully threw him out. <br> His star did not entirely wane. He became a power among the back-room Reds who steered Henry Wallace through the presidential campaign. But when the Korean war began, he, like Wallace, began slipping away from his Commie cronies. California's Congressman Richard Nixon, scenting opportunity, decided to call him before the House Un-American Activities Committee and ask him a few questions. (Once before, when Whittaker Chambers named Pressman as a member of the same elite apparatus as Alger Hiss, Pressman had taken refuge in the Fifth Amendment, refused to answer Congressmen's questions.) <br> Last week, Pressman decided to reverse his field... <br> This week ... he reluctantly consented to name three men who had been fellow Communists in the '30s—John Abt, Nathan Witt and Charles Kramer...\n\nIn his memoir posthumously published in 1993, Abt revealed that the Ware Group was a Communist Party unit and that he had been a member.\n\nOn March 14, 1937, Abt married Jessica Smith Ware, widow of Harold Ware; she died in 1983.\n\nLater, he married Vita Barsky.\n\nIn 1984, on his 80th birthday, Abt admitted to being a long-time member of the CPUSA.\n\nOn August 10, 1991, Abt died at the Columbia-Greene Medical Center in Hudson, New York from a stroke. He was 87.\n\nAbt's memoir appeared in print in 1993, some two years after his death in 1991. In its review, the peer-reviewed \"Labor Studies Journal\" expressed doubt in many of Abt's major claims (e.g., \"To hear John Abt tell about it, the chief counsel to the American Communist party knew virtually nothing about the inner workings of the party\") and in fact \"shed a dark light on Communist morality and class position.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1961275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1961275", "title": "Amyloid precursor protein", "text": "Amyloid precursor protein\n\nAmyloid precursor protein (APP) is an integral membrane protein expressed in many tissues and concentrated in the synapses of neurons. Its primary function is not known, though it has been implicated as a regulator of synapse formation, neural plasticity, antimicrobial activity , and iron export. APP is best known as the precursor molecule whose proteolysis generates amyloid beta (Aβ), a polypeptide containing 37 to 49 amino acid residues, whose amyloid fibrillar form is the primary component of amyloid plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients.\n\nAPP is an ancient and highly conserved protein. In humans, the gene for APP is located on chromosome 21 and contains 18 exons spanning 290 kilobases. Several alternative splicing isoforms of APP have been observed in humans, ranging in length from 639 to 770 amino acids, with certain isoforms preferentially expressed in neurons; changes in the neuronal ratio of these isoforms have been associated with Alzheimer's disease. Homologous proteins have been identified in other organisms such as \"Drosophila\" (fruit flies), \"C. elegans\" (roundworms), and all mammals. The amyloid beta region of the protein, located in the membrane-spanning domain, is not well conserved across species and has no obvious connection with APP's native-state biological functions.\n\nMutations in critical regions of amyloid precursor protein, including the region that generates amyloid beta (Aβ), cause familial susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease. For example, several mutations outside the Aβ region associated with familial Alzheimer's have been found to dramatically increase production of Aβ.\n\nA mutation (A673T) in the APP gene protects against Alzheimer’s disease. This substitution is adjacent to the beta secretase cleavage site and results in a 40% reduction in the formation of amyloid beta in vitro.\n\nA number of distinct, largely independently-folding structural domains have been identified in the APP sequence. The extracellular region, much larger than the intracellular region, is divided into the E1 and E2 domains, linked by an acidic domain (AcD); E1 contains two subdomains including a growth factor-like domain (GFLD) and a copper-binding domain (CuBD) interacting tightly together. A serine protease inhibitor domain, absent from the isoform differentially expressed in the brain, is found between acidic region and E2 domain. The complete crystal structure of APP has not yet been solved; however, individual domains have been successfully crystallized, the growth factor-like domain, the copper-binding domain, the complete E1 domain and the E2 domain.\n\nAPP undergoes extensive post-translational modification including glycosylation, phosphorylation, sialylation, and tyrosine sulfation, as well as many types of proteolytic processing to generate peptide fragments. It is commonly cleaved by proteases in the secretase family; alpha secretase and beta secretase both remove nearly the entire extracellular domain to release membrane-anchored carboxy-terminal fragments that may be associated with apoptosis. Cleavage by gamma secretase within the membrane-spanning domain after beta-secretase cleavage generates the amyloid-beta fragment; gamma secretase is a large multi-subunit complex whose components have not yet been fully characterized, but include presenilin, whose gene has been identified as a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's.\n\nThe amyloidogenic processing of APP has been linked to its presence in lipid rafts. When APP molecules occupy a lipid raft region of membrane, they are more accessible to and differentially cleaved by beta secretase, whereas APP molecules outside a raft are differentially cleaved by the non-amyloidogenic alpha secretase. Gamma secretase activity has also been associated with lipid rafts. The role of cholesterol in lipid raft maintenance has been cited as a likely explanation for observations that high cholesterol and apolipoprotein E genotype are major risk factors for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAlthough the native biological role of APP is of obvious interest to Alzheimer's research, thorough understanding has remained elusive.\n\nThe most-substantiated role for APP is in synaptic formation and repair; its expression is upregulated during neuronal differentiation and after neural injury. Roles in cell signaling, long-term potentiation, and cell adhesion have been proposed and supported by as-yet limited research. In particular, similarities in post-translational processing have invited comparisons to the signaling role of the surface receptor protein Notch.\n\nAPP knockout mice are viable and have relatively minor phenotypic effects including impaired long-term potentiation and memory loss without general neuron loss. On the other hand, transgenic mice with upregulated APP expression have also been reported to show impaired long-term potentiation.\n\nThe logical inference is that because Aβ accumulates excessively in Alzheimer's disease its precursor, APP, would be elevated as well. However, neuronal cell bodies contain less APP as a function of their proximity to amyloid plaques. The data indicate that this deficit in APP results from a decline in production rather than an increase in catalysis. Loss of a neuron's APP may affect physiological deficits that contribute to dementia.\n\nIn neurons of the human brain, somatic recombination occurs frequently in the gene that encodes APP. Neurons from individuals with sporadic Alzheimer's disease show greater \"APP\" gene diversity due to somatic recombination than neurons from healthy individuals.\n\nMolecules synthesized in the cell bodies of neurons must be conveyed outward to the distal synapses. This is accomplished via fast anterograde transport. It has been found that APP can mediate interaction between cargo and kinesin and thus facilitate this transport. Specifically, a short peptide 15-amino-acid sequence from the cytoplasmic carboxy-terminus is necessary for interaction with the motor protein.\n\nAdditionally, it has been shown that the interaction between APP and kinesin is specific to the peptide sequence of APP. In a recent experiment involving transport of peptide-conjugated colored beads, controls were conjugated to a single amino acid, glycine, such that they display the same terminal carboxylic acid group as APP without the intervening 15-amino-acid sequence mentioned above. The control beads were not motile, which demonstrated that the terminal COOH moiety of peptides is not sufficient to mediate transport.\n\nA different perspective on Alzheimer's is revealed by a mouse study that has found that APP possesses ferroxidase activity similar to ceruloplasmin, facilitating iron export through interaction with ferroportin; it seems that this activity is blocked by zinc trapped by accumulated Aβ in Alzheimer's. It has been shown that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the 5'UTR of APP mRNA can disrupt its translation.\n\nThe hypothesis that APP has ferroxidase activity in its E2 domain and facilitates export of Fe(II) is possibly incorrect since the proposed ferroxidase site of APP located in the E2 domain does not have ferroxidase activity.\n\nAs APP does not possess ferroxidase activity within its E2 domain, the mechanism of APP-modulated iron efflux from ferroportin has come under scrutiny. One model suggests that APP acts to stabilize the iron efflux protein ferroportin in the plasma membrane of cells thereby increasing the total number of ferroportin molecules at the membrane. These iron-transporters can then be activated by known mammalian ferroxidases (i.e. ceruloplasmin or hephaestin).\n\nThe amyloid-β precursor protein (AβPP), and all associated secretases, are expressed early in development and play a key role in the endocrinology of reproduction – with the differential processing of AβPP by secretases regulating human embryonic stem cell (hESC) proliferation as well as their differentiation into neural precursor cells (NPC). The pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) increases AβPP expression and hESC proliferation while progesterone directs AβPP processing towards the non-amyloidogenic pathway, which promotes hESC differentiation into NPC.\n\nAβPP and its cleavage products do not promote the proliferation and differentiation of post-mitotic neurons; rather, the overexpression of either wild-type or mutant AβPP in post-mitotic neurons induces apoptotic death following their re-entry into the cell cycle. It is postulated that the loss of sex steroids (including progesterone) but the elevation in luteinizing hormone, the adult equivalent of hCG, post-menopause and during andropause drives amyloid-β production and re-entry of post-mitotic neurons into the cell cycle.\n\nAmyloid precursor protein has been shown to interact with:\n\nAPP interacts with reelin, a protein implicated in a number of brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease.\n\n"}

It is said that the circular structure of the 11th-century Chausath Yogini Temple may also have inspired the design of the building. Construction of the Parliament House began in 1921 and it was completed in 1927.\n\nThe opening ceremony of the Parliament House, which then housed the Imperial Legislative Council, was performed on 18 January 1927 by Lord Irwin, Viceroy of India. The third session of Central Legislative Assembly was held in this house on 19 January 1927.\n\nTwo floors were added to the structure in 1956 due to a demand for more space.\n\nThe Parliament Museum, opened in 2006, stands next to the Parliament House in the building of the Parliamentary Library.\n\nThe shape of the building is circular, which is based on the Chausath Yogini temple. At the centre of the building is the Central Chamber, and surrounding this are the semicircular halls that were constructed for the sessions of the Chamber of Princes (now used as the Library Hall), the State Council (now used for the Rajya Sabha), and the Central Legislative Assembly (now used for the Lok Sabha).\nThe building is surrounded by large gardens and the perimeter is fenced off by sandstone railings (\"jali\").\n\nA new Parliament building may replace the existing complex. The new building is being considered on account of the stability concerns regarding the current complex. A committee to suggest several alternatives to the current building has been set up by the ex-Speaker, Meira Kumar. The present building, an 85-year-old structure suffers from inadequacy of space to house members and their staff and is thought to suffer from structural issues. The building also needs to be protected because of its heritage. On August 5th 2019 the Vice president and chairperson of the upper house of Indian parliament (Rajyasabha) Venkaiah Naidu proposed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to have a new building for the Parliament. In January 2020, Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla announced that parliament will be holding its sessions in a new building in 2022 when country would celebrating its 75th independence day. Renovation of central vista from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate is also underway.\n\nLok Sabha chamber is expected to have increased seating capacity to accommodate more members as number of MPs may increase with India's population. Lok Sabha may need to have 848 members by 2026. New complex will able to house 900 Lok Sabha MPs and 1350 members in total. According to Bimal Patel, the architect in charge of the redesign of Central Vista, the new complex is likely to have a triangular shape. It will be built next to the existing complex and will be much bigger than former one. North and south blocks which house ministries will be converted into museums and relocation PMO and ministries and redesign of Rajpath will take place.\n\nOn 13 December 2001, the building of the Parliament was attacked by five Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists. In addition to all the attackers, six military personnel and one civilian were killed.\n\n\n"}

He says:\n\"I’m not double-jointed at all. The only place where I am double-jointed in my thumbs, which doesn’t even matter. I would say I’m probably a little more flexible than most people in certain areas, mainly my shoulders and my ankles, but I wasn’t born that way. Those areas became flexible because of years of practicing.\"\n\nFollowing his exposure in the viral video, Bernal was hired to participate in a number of advertisements, such as Heineken (dancing to \"Cobrastyle\" by the Teddybears), Volkswagen, Apple iPod, 7-Eleven Slurpee, Pepsi, Puma, and Doritos. He also made a cameo appearance in the movie \"You Got Served\" and TV performances including \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\".\n\nComputer graphics technology were used in several of the commercials Bernal took part in, superimposing others' faces (old, young, male, female) onto his body so that they appeared to dance like him. In one of his most popular ads, a commercial for the Volkswagen Golf GTI created in January 2005, Gene Kelly's head was superimposed onto Bernal's body in a re-enactment of \"Singin' in the Rain\" remixed by Manchester group Mint Royale.\n\nBernal also filmed and edited a large amount of the documentary video titled Detours. The video featured experimental dance styles focused primarily on four dancers, Midus, Kujo, Rawbzilla, and Elsewhere. While focusing much of the video on the four primary dancers, dozens of others were also featured in the video. The project has since ended and videos can be bought through various websites.\n\nIn September 2006, he was featured in the music video, for \"Sister Twisted\", a song by Mexican band Kinky, in which he plays a Mexican cowboy who does a twisted locking and popping performance while a war against aliens occurs in the background.\n\nOn August 8, 2007, Bernal and his dancing were featured in a segment of the inaugural episode of ABC's new video-clip program, \"i-Caught\".\n\nBernal was collaborating with Michael Jackson for Michael's \"This Is It\" residency at London's O2 Arena prior to Jackson's death.\n\nBernal was the dance double for the Mad Hatter in Tim Burton's \"Alice in Wonderland\" (2010) during the \"Futterwacken\" dance.\n\nHe worked with artist Nicholas Galanin to dance in a video titled \"Tsu Heidel Shugaxtutaan\" or \"We will again open this container of wisdom that has been left in our care\". He has also collaborated with other dancers such as Mori Koichiro ().\n\n"}
{"id": "1961296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1961296", "title": "Chase Utley", "text": "Chase Utley\n\nChase Cameron Utley (born December 17, 1978) is an American former professional baseball second baseman who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for 16 seasons, primarily for the Philadelphia Phillies. He also played for the Los Angeles Dodgers. He is a six-time All-Star, won a World Series with the Phillies in 2008, and was chosen as the second baseman on the \"Sports Illustrated\" All-Decade Team for the 2000s. \nHe batted left-handed and threw right-handed.\n\nAfter becoming a permanent fixture as the Phillies' second baseman, Utley demonstrated versatility, spending some time at first base as well. As his fielding improved, he and shortstop Jimmy Rollins were regarded as one of the best middle-infield combinations in the NL until Rollins was traded to the Dodgers in the winter of 2014. Utley was considered by fans to be a team leader of the Phillies, alongside Rollins and Ryan Howard, and he has been noted for his leadership qualities with the Dodgers. Utley was known for his quiet understated demeanor, instead setting an example for teammates with his exhaustive preparation in the video room and the batting cage. Utley's seven career World Series home runs are the most for a second baseman, and he shares the single-series postseason record of five home runs with Reggie Jackson and George Springer. Utley also holds the major league record for most stolen bases in a single season without being caught, set in 2009 when he stole 23 bases. He is also noteworthy for having participated in seven no-hitters, of which he was on the winning side in four.\n\nUtley was born in Pasadena, California, and was raised in Long Beach, California, with his younger sister, Taylor Ann. He is the son of David and Terrell Utley. \n\nUtley played baseball at Long Beach Polytechnic High School and at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) for the UCLA Bruins. In high school, his coach said that Utley had \"the fastest hands he had ever seen on a high school player.\" He hit over .500 his senior year, with a slugging percentage of over 1.000, struck out just twice in 80 at bats, and earned high school All-American honors. He also set a school single-season record with 14 home runs Utley was drafted in the second round of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers with the 76th pick, but turned down a $850,000 offer by the Dodgers to attend UCLA. A star shortstop in high school, the Bruins instead moved him to second base because his arm strength was more of a liability at shortstop. He hit .382 with 22 home runs as a junior at UCLA in 2000 while leading the Bruins to the NCAA Super Regionals. He was selected to the All-Pac-10 team and the Sporting News and National Collegiate Baseball Writers first team All-American teams.\n\nWhile at UCLA, Utley played collegiate summer baseball for the Brewster Whitecaps of the Cape Cod Baseball League in 1998, and returned to the league in 1999 to play for the Cotuit Kettleers.\n\nUtley was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the first round (15th pick) of the 2000 amateur draft. At the time, the team's scouting director claimed he was a combination of Jeff Kent and Adam Kennedy. He signed on July 29, 2000, for a $1,780,000 signing bonus.\n\nUtley played for the Phillies' farm system with the Batavia Muckdogs of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League in 2000, the Clearwater Phillies of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League in 2001, and the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons of the Class AAA International League in 2002 and 2003. He was selected to the All-Star Futures Game in 2001 and made the International League post-season all-star team in 2003.\n\nUtley made his major league debut on April 4, 2003, as a pinch hitter against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was struck out swinging by Jeff Suppan in his first at-bat. In his first major league start, on April 24 against the Colorado Rockies, Utley recorded his first major league hit, a grand slam off Aaron Cook. He was optioned back to the minors on April 30 recalled by the Phillies again in August 2003, to replace Plácido Polanco at second base (Polanco was moved to third to compensate for the loss of third baseman David Bell to the disabled list). Utley scored the final game winning RBI in Phillies history at Veterans Stadium, on September 27, 2003. Utley recorded the final at-bat at Veterans Stadium by grounding into a game-ending double play on September 28, 2003. In 43 games, he had a .239 batting average.\n\nBy the end of 2004, it became evident to management that Utley was the team's future second baseman. However, a roster spot was not permanently available; his path to the majors was effectively blocked by Polanco. Despite his out-playing Polanco for much of the season, he remained on the bench despite Phillies fans and media commentators asking why he wasn't \n\nplaying more. He played in 94 games for the Phillies in 2004 (which included 13 at first base) and hit .266 with 13 homers and 57 RBI.\n\nIn June 2005, the Phillies traded Polanco to the Tigers for pitcher Ugueth Urbina and infielder Ramón Martínez. As a full-time starter Utley hit .291 with 28 homers and 105 RBI and also stole 16 bases. He was selected by the Philadelphia chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America as the co-recipient of the 2005 Mike Schmidt Most Valuable Player Award.\n\nUtley was a member of Team USA in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, and was selected by fans to start at second base for the National League at the 2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at PNC Park in Pittsburgh. In November, he traveled to Japan with other major league stars to compete against Japanese All-Stars in an exhibition tournament.\n\nDuring the 2006 season, Utley maintained a 35-game hitting streak—the second-longest streak in Phillies history behind teammate Jimmy Rollins, who hit for 38 straight games between 2005 and 2006 (36 games in 2005 and two in 2006). Utley tied Luis Castillo, who had a 35-game hitting streak in 2002, for the longest hitting streak by a second baseman. Utley's streak was also the longest for a purely left-handed hitter since Tommy Holmes' 37-game streak in 1945. As a result, Utley was named the National League Player of the Month for July 2006.\n\nOn September 24, Utley hit two home runs in a 10–7 win over the Florida Marlins. It was his seventh multi-home run game of the 2006 season, tying a franchise record set in 1968 and tied by Ryan Howard in 2006. Utley combined with Jimmy Rollins in 2006 to become the first pair of middle infielders in National League history to hit 25 home runs each in the same season; Utley hit 32, while Rollins hit 25. He later received the Silver Slugger Award for being the best hitting second baseman in the National League.\nHe also batted .309 in 2006 with 32 homers and 102 RBI.\n\nOn January 21, 2007, the day after his wedding, Utley signed a 7-year, $85 million contract extension with the Phillies.\n\nAfter starting the season hot, Utley was again selected by the fans to be the starting second baseman in the 2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, which was his second All-Star selection. However, on July 26, Utley was hit by a pitch thrown by Washington Nationals pitcher John Lannan; he broke the fourth metacarpal bone in his right hand. \"I'll be back. Don't worry, guys,\" Utley said after the game. \"It's a break, but not that bad of a break. I definitely expect to be back ... this season.\" He had successful surgery on his hand, but as a result of the surgery, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list. Utley returned to the lineup on August 27, hit a home run and an RBI double, went 3 for 5, and drew a curtain call from the hometown crowd.\n\nUtley finished the season with a .332 batting average, 22 home runs, 103 RBIs and 48 doubles (second in the National League). He helped the Phillies to their first playoff appearance in fourteen seasons as the team capped a dramatic comeback by clinching the National League East division title on the final day of the regular season. Utley's offensive performance also earned him a Silver Slugger Award for the second consecutive season. He had two hits in 11 at-bats as the Phillies were swept in three games by the Colorado Rockies in the 2007 National League Division Series.\n\nThrough the month of April, Utley hit a league-leading 11 home runs – including seven in the seven games from April 17–23. He completed a streak of five consecutive games with a home run, and hit .360 (good for fifth in the National League) in 111 at-bats on his way to becoming the National League's Player of the Month. His five-game home run streak tied the Phillies franchise record, shared by Bobby Abreu (May 8–12, 2005), Mike Schmidt (June 6–10, 1979) and Dick Allen (May 27 – June 1, 1969).\n\nThough his bat cooled a bit in May (his monthly average was .259), Utley still hit eight more home runs in the month, breaking the Phillies franchise record for home runs before June – Cy Williams (1923) and Ryan Howard (2006) shared the previous mark of 18 – and knocked in 26 RBIs. When Howard hit his 15th home run on May 30, he and Utley became the first pair of Phillies to hit 15 home runs each before June. On May 13, 2008, Utley received an unexpected accolade from lifelong baseball fan (and 43rd US President) George W. Bush, who stated in an interview with politico.com that Utley would be the first position player he would select if he were an MLB team owner. He was also selected by Fitness Magazine as one of the 25 \"fittest guys in the country.\"\n\nOn June 1, Utley hit his Major League-leading 20th home run and drove in his National League-leading 50th run as part of a comeback win against the Florida Marlins that propelled the Phillies back into first place in the National League East; the 1-for-2 performance capped a productive week for Utley that earned him the National League Player of the Week Award, his fifth, for the first time since April 23–29, 2007. The next night, Utley hit another home run for another streak of five games with a longball amidst a span of eight games with seven home runs (from May 25 to June 2). Utley hit the first in a set of back-to-back-to-back Philadelphia home runs in a 20–2 win over the St. Louis Cardinals on June 13, along with Ryan Howard and Pat Burrell. It was the seventh time that the Phillies had hit three consecutive home runs, the first time since May 18, 2004, and the fourth occurrence by any team in the 2008 Major League Baseball season.\n\nUtley went a career-long 0-for-24 in the midst of a 1-for-29 slump, during which the Phillies lost a season-high six in a row. On the 21st, Utley was benched for the first time this season, ending his streak of 101 consecutive games played. On the 25th, Utley broke out of his skid with a 4-for-5 performance – his first four-hit game of the season – in a 4–0 shutout over the Oakland Athletics. Utley was also selected to start his third consecutive All-Star game.\n\nAt the end of the 2008 regular season, with 33 home runs, 104 RBI, and a team-high 177 hits, Utley helped the Phillies into the 2008 playoffs, and win their first National League pennant since 1993 and first World Series title since 1980 (the second ever World Series title for the team). Utley batted 3 for 18 (.167) in the World Series, but hit two home runs and walked five times as well. During the seventh inning of Game 5, Utley faked a throw to first, then threw Jason Bartlett out at home for the third out in a play later described as having saved the Series for the Phillies. The fans voted his fake and throw to home plate in Game 5 as the \"This Year in Baseball Awards\" Postseason Moment of the Year. \"Sports Talk Philly\" highlighted this play as they named Utley as Number 6 on the list of the 25 greatest Phillies.\n\nFollowing the ensuing World Series parade on October 31, 2008, culminating in a celebration at Citizens Bank Park, Utley came up to the microphone after being introduced by Harry Kalas and said to the fans in the stadium: \"World champions. World fucking champions!\" As he said this, his teammate Jayson Werth jumped up in roaring approval. The Philadelphia crowd erupted in prolonged cheers. The expletive was broadcast live on multiple Philadelphia television stations, which had not placed the celebration on tape delay.\n\nUtley underwent hip surgery in November 2008.\n\nIn 2009, he was named #6 on the \"Sporting News\"' list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball. A panel of 100 baseball people, many of them members of the Baseball Hall of Fame and winners of major baseball awards, was polled to arrive at the list.\n\nHe was the starter at second base for the National League All-Star team.\n\nIn 2009 Utley led the majors in hit by pitch, with 24. Utley also had a perfect stolen-base percentage in 2009, with 23 steals, setting a record for most steals in a single season without being caught.\n\nOn October 28, Utley drew a two-out walk in the first inning of Game 1 of the 2009 World Series, setting a record for reaching base in consecutive postseason games (26). Utley hit two home runs in his next two at-bats, the first World Series game played in the new Yankee Stadium. With both home runs coming against left-hander CC Sabathia, Utley joined Babe Ruth as the second left-handed batter to hit two home runs in a World Series game against a left-handed pitcher. On November 1, Utley hit another home run against Sabathia in Game 4, and one day later, Utley hit two home runs in Game 5, giving him a total of five for the series, tying Reggie Jackson for the most home runs in a World Series. After the season, Utley was named the winner of the National League's Silver Slugger at second base for the fourth consecutive season.\n\nIn December, \"Sports Illustrated\" named Utley as the second baseman on its MLB All-Decade Team.\n\nOn June 29, Utley was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a sprained thumb. He was voted into the All-Star Game as the starter at second base (for the fifth consecutive year), but was unable to play due to injury. He won a Fielding Bible Award for his statistically based defensive excellence during the year.\n\nUtley finished the 2011 regular season having scored 54 runs, hitting safely 103 times (including 21 doubles, 6 triples, and 11 home runs), with a .259 batting average. This drop-off in performance coincided with the onset prior to the season of chronic knee problems. These conditions included patellar tendinitis, chondromalacia, and bone inflammation.\n\nDuring spring training, Utley left camp in mid-March to meet with a specialist regarding treatment of conditions in both knees, including cartilage damage.\nUtley began the season on the 15-day Disabled list. He was reactivated on June 27. In his first game of the season, Utley went 3 for 5 with a solo home run in his first at bat. He finished 2012 with numbers very similar to 2011, hitting .256 with 11 HR and 45 RBI.\n\nUtley said that his knee was feeling great prior to the 2013 Grapefruit League games. On Opening Day, against the Atlanta Braves, he hit his 200th career home run. In 131 games of the 2013 season, Utley batted .284 with 18 homers and 69 runs batted in.\n\nOn August 7, 2013 it was announced that Utley and the Phillies had agreed on a two-year, $27 million contract extension with multiple vesting options.\n\nUtley had a slow start to spring training. He was hitting only .175 (10 for 57), including 1 double and 3 RBIs with just two games remaining. Utley remained confident for the 2014 season. \"For younger guys, I think results make you feel better,\" Utley said. \"But as you go, you realize they're not quite as important this time of year. Physically, I feel good. Early in the spring, I felt pretty decent at the plate. There were some times in the middle when I felt a little uncomfortable and a little out of sorts. The last four or five days, I've started to feel a little more comfortable at the dish. For a guy that has done this for a few years, your game plan for Spring training is different than it would be during the regular season.\" Despite a poor spring training, over the first two weeks of the season, he was \"the hottest hitter in baseball\", and as of April 13, possessed a 1.314 on-base plus slugging (OPS) average.\n\nOn May 25, Utley was the last out of Josh Beckett's no hitter when he struck out looking against the Los Angeles Dodgers right hander.\n\nOn July 6, MLB announced that Utley was voted in by the fans to start at second base in All-Star Game, which took place at Target Field in Minneapolis.\n\nUtley started the regular season very slowly. By May 8th, his batting average had dropped to just .099. He was hitting .179 as of June 22, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list on June 24 due to right ankle inflammation, from which he returned on July 7. In 249 at bats, he batted .217/.284/.333.\n\nOn August 19, 2015, Utley was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for Darnell Sweeney and John Richy. In his first game as a Dodger, Utley impressed with his aggressive baserunning, an area in which the Dodgers had struggled most of the season. On August 30, Utley was the final out of a no-hitter for the second time in as many years, this time against the Cubs' Jake Arrieta. As a Dodger, he was in 34 games and hit .202/.291/.363 with three homers and nine RBIs in 124 at bats. He also played three games at third base, the first time he had played there in the majors.\n\nOn October 10, 2015, during the second game of the 2015 National League Division Series, Utley slid into Rubén Tejada of the New York Mets in an attempt to break up what might have been an inning-ending double play, fracturing Tejada's right fibula in the collision. Utley was ruled safe by the umpires after a video review. The Dodgers, who were losing 2-1 at the time of the incident, rallied to win the game 5-2. Major League Baseball suspended Utley for two games for his conduct \"in violation of Official Baseball Rule 5.09 (a) (13), which is designed to protect fielders from precisely this type of rolling block that occurs away from the base.\" Utley appealed the suspension and remained active for the rest of the Dodgers post-season games. MLB subsequently dropped Utley's suspension on March 6, 2016, with Chief Baseball Officer Joe Torre stating \"There wasn't anything clear-cut to say that play violated a rule.\"\n\nAfter the season, the Dodgers declined his 2016 option, making him a free agent. In December, he re-signed with the Dodgers on a one-year, $7 million, contract.\n\nOn May 28, 2016, in a regular season game against the New York Mets, Utley hit a solo home run and a grand slam, after he was thrown at by Mets pitcher Noah Syndergaard in the third inning in an apparent retaliation for Utley's slide on Rubén Tejada during the 2015 NLDS. He scored his 1,000th career run on June 22 against the Washington Nationals. On July 6, during a 14-inning 6-4 loss to the Baltimore Orioles, Utley had a career-high six hits and became the third-oldest player to accomplish such a feat. He was honored with the 2016 Roy Campanella Award. He appeared in 138 games in 2016, hitting .252/.319/.396 with 14 homers and 52 RBIs.\n\nIn Game 4 of the 2016 NLDS against the Washington Nationals, Utley hit a two-out RBI single in the bottom of the eighth inning to break a 5-5 tie and lead the Dodgers to an eventual 6-5 win. The Dodgers went on to eliminate the Nationals in five games.\n\nIn February 2017, Utley signed a one-year, $2 million, contract to return to the Dodgers. He recorded his 1,000th career RBI with a double off Neftalí Feliz of the Kansas City Royals on July 7. On September 16, Utley recorded his 400th career double in a game against the Washington Nationals In 2017, he batted .236/.324/.405 in 309 at bats with eight home runs and 34 RBIs in 127 games played. \n\nIn the 2017 post-season, he was hitless in 15 at-bats, with five strikeouts, two walks and two hit by pitches. In Game 6 Utley was the oldest to score a go-ahead run in a World Series elimination game since Enos Slaughter in 1957. \n\nOn February 17, 2018, Utley re-signed with the Dodgers for two years and $2 million. Utley was hit by a pitch on April 18 for the 200th time in his career, becoming only the eighth player all-time to be hit by 200 career pitches.\n\nOn July 13, Utley announced his intention to retire after the conclusion of the 2018 season. His final MLB game was on September 30, 2018, where at San Francisco he struck out against Steven Okert in his only at-bat. \n\nUtley was left off of the Dodgers’ postseason roster, but continued to travel and practice with the team as they lost the 2018 World Series to the Boston Red Sox four games to one.\n\nUtley met his wife, Jennifer, while they were undergrads at UCLA. They married in January 2007 and have two children. They reside in Sausalito, California, during the offseason. The couple are avid animal lovers, having raised over $45,000 for the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Utley appeared on behalf of PETA in their \"Adopt Don't Buy\" video, encouraging people to find companion animals at shelters. Utley and his wife are vocal proponents of rescue dogs and are particularly fond of pit bulls.\n\nHis batter introductory music in Philadelphia and in Los Angeles was the song \"Kashmir\" by Led Zeppelin. Utley appeared alongside teammate Ryan Howard as himself on the 2010 episode of \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" \"The Gang Gets Stranded in the Woods\". On September 3, 2013, Utley responded to a letter written by Mac from the show years earlier.\n\n\n<br>\n"}

After signing to Matina, they released two complementary EPs, \"Face Mayura\" and \"Face Pisaroto\", which sold out the same day they were released. The combined artwork from the covers of both EPs form a single image. While on Matina, Vidoll also released their first single, \"Occult Proposal\", starting a tradition of Christmas Day single releases, and contributed to several compilation CDs.\n\nAfter Matina shut down, the label founder, Kisaki, formed Under Code Production March 1, 2003. The first release from the new label was a pair of singles which were still numbered as a Matina release. Some of the songs were combined onto the EP \"If...Yakubutsu Ranyou Bokumetsu Campaign\" in a larger edition. The release was followed by the band's first national tour in Japan, as well as their first solo live show. The band then released their first DVD, \"Doll Mansion 209 Goushitsu\", showcasing their music videos. Later that year guitarist Ayano left the band for musical differences. Hide was recruited as the new guitarist in September. The band started a 10 date tour with Gazette in October and both bands shared the cover of \"Cure\" magazine in November. This tour solidified Vidoll's place in the Visual Kei scene, and their Christmas single \"Hitokiri no Kurixxxxsu\" hit number 79 on the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart.\n\nOn March 10, the single \"Wagahai wa, Korosuke Nari...\" was released and reached number 4 on the Oricon Independent Chart. After the first press of 10,000 was sold out, a second pressing of 10,000 was released later in the year. On April 28, the French label Mabell released \"Bijinkei,\" an 11 track compilation album of Vidoll songs for the European market. In May, Vidoll's vocalist Jui performed in France with Kisaki Project. Vidoll was one of five bands to be selected for \"Expect Rush\", a yearly publication by \"Shoxx\" that catalogs independent visual kei artists. On June 30 both the single \"Ningyo\" and the concert DVD \"Gyaku\" went on sale, and \"Ningyo\" reached third place on the Oricon Independent Chart.\n\nThe tour final \"Ningyou Enzetsu\" was held on September 11 and was the final stop in their one-man tour. A special copy of Romanesque Gothic was released with a special (all black) cover.

A live DVD of the event went on sale November 17, \"Ningyou Enzetsu 2004.9.11 Liquidroom Ebisu\". Toward the end of the year several more one-man performances were held. On December 15 two mini-albums and a DVD were released. \"Mukashi Natsukashi Ningyoushuu: Sono Ichi\" and \"Mukashi Natsukashi Ningyoushuu: Sono Ni\" were new recordings of songs from previously sold out releases. The DVD \"Ningyou Kai PV\" contained two Music Videos, one for \"Ningyo\" and \"F-Stein to M\".\n\nOn January 1, Vidoll's official fan club \"Ningyou Kan\" began. In March Vidoll had a One-man tour only for members of their fan club, for a total of 8 shows.\n\nThe Live DVD \"Mijin Kakumei~Saishuu Kaukumei Yokokubi 1229~ was released, with over 3 hours of live footage. A special single and Music video (Remind Story) was released in two versions, the Osaka version and Tokyo version on April 22 and 26th, sold at two of their one-man shows. \n\nOn June 8, Mukashi Natsukashi Soushuuhen + Omake Tsuki was released. This is a re-release of the songs on the two \"Mukashi Natsukashi Ningyoushuu\" mini-albums, combined into one album, as the previous albums had quickly sold out all 10,000 copies. The \"extra\" was a music video on a DVD. On July 13 another Live DVD, from their \"Roman Kokuhaku\" live was released.\n\nOn April 26, at the Roman Kokuhaku one-man live, Jui announced that members Hide and Yukine were leaving Vidoll at the end of June. Messages from each band member were quickly posted on Vidoll's official website confirming the band was staying together. Hide's message stated that though he loved the band, the members, and the fans, the hectic tour schedule was affecting his health. Yukine left for personal reasons.\n\nThe band took one last tour \"Toumeihanzai\" before Hide and Yukine left on 6.26. This was a fan club only tour. The last concert with all the members was recorded and later released as a set of two DVDs through the fan club.\n\nOn June 13, two new members: Shun (of CalorZe and Gossip) and Gil (Lilith), joined Vidoll.\nKisaki, the executive manager of Vidoll's label, Under Code Productions, announced that three of the label's bands, including Vidoll, would be \"graduating\" from the label.

He graduated from Johns Hopkins University and the Harvard Law School.\n\n In 1932, he was a law secretary to Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes of the United States Supreme Court. From 1933 to 1935, he was employed by the Agricultural Adjustment Administration of the United States Department of Labor. In 1934, he was also attached to a special U.S. Senate committee investigating the munitions industry. In 1935, he was employed as a special attorney by the United States Department of Justice.\n\nOn September 18, 1936, he was appointed an assistant to the Assistant Secretary of State and worked in the State Department throughout World War II. In 1945, he joined the law firm of Covington & Burling.\n\n On August 3, 1948, Whittaker Chambers included the name of Donald Hiss along with his brother Alger and more than half a dozen other former Federal officials as members of the Ware Group and of the Communist Party when testifying under subpoena to HUAC.\n\nOn August 7, 1948, Chambers stated to the committee, \"I can give you the general impression. He was much less intelligent than Alger. Much less sensitive than his brother.\"\n\nHiss retained Nebraskan Hugh Cox as counsel. Cox was famous as Thurman Arnold's chief deputy,\" as an early partner at Root Clark & Bird (later Root, Clark, Buckner & Ballantine; later Dewey Ballantine, later Dewey & LeBoeuf) and fellow attorney with Hiss at Covington & Burling, where he was called the \"perfect advocate\") during the Hiss-Chambers Case.\"\n\nOn August 13, 1948, like his brother and Harry Dexter White, Hiss denied the allegation, stating:I flatly deny every statement made by Mr. Chambers with respect to me. I am not, and never have been, a member of the Communist Party or of any formal or informal organizations affiliated with, or fronting in any manner whatsoever for, the Communist Party. In fact, the only organizations and clubs to which I have belonged are the local Y.M.C.A., the Miles River Yacht Club of Maryland, the old Washington Racquet Club, the Harvard Law School Association, the American Society of International Law, and college fraternities and athletic clubs.I have no recollection of ever having met any person by the name of D. Whittaker Chambers, nor do I recognize his photograph which I have seen in the public press. I am not and never have been in sympathy with the principles of the Communist Party ...

His expertise lay in international trade and tariff law. He taught international law at Catholic University and at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.\n\nHe retired in 1976.

Yet, despite that, the production values were higher than what their competition offered for their usual products.\n\nBeckett enjoyed critical success with their debut title, \"Gene-Fusion A.D. 2310\". They continued to produce acclaimed miniseries, including \"The Ballad of Sleeping Beauty\", \"Fade from Grace\" and \"Ronin Hood of the 47 Samurai\".

Beckett Comics retained their independence, but, without the support of their parent company, they found themselves without resources to publish and distribute their titles. They made a deal with Image Comics -through whom they published the Graphic novels \"The Cobbler's Monster\" and \"Red Warrior\"- to compensate for that problem. Under the terms, Beckett Comics would retain their editorial and creative independence. However, the prices of their titles would be more in line with the rest of the U.S. comic book industry.

The fossils are preserved in ironstone concretions, formed approximately in the mid-Pennsylvanian epoch of the Carboniferous period. These concretions frequently preserve both hard and soft tissues of animal and plant materials, as well as many soft-bodied organisms that do not normally fossilize. The quality, quantity and diversity of fossils in the area, known since the mid-nineteenth century, make the Mazon Creek ' important to paleontologists, in attempting to reconstruct the paleoecology of the sites. The locality was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1997.\n\nThe Mazon Creek fossils are found in the Upper Carboniferous Francis Creek Shale; the type locality is the Mazon River (or Mazon Creek), a tributary of the Illinois River near Morris, Grundy County, Illinois. The 25 to 30 meters of shale were formed approximately , during the Pennsylvanian period. The fossiliferous concretions are usually found within the thickest deposits of Francis Creek. The concretions occur in localized deposits within the silty to sandy mudstones, in the lower four metres of the formation. The paleoecosystem is believed to be a large river delta system, deposited by at least one major river system flowing from the northeast. The sediments are believed to derive from the Appalachian orogeny events. The delta had a tropical climate, a result of the area being within 10° north latitude of the equator during the Pennsylvanian.\n\nThe remains of plants and animals were rapidly buried by the sediment deposited in the deltaic system. Bacterial decomposition of the remains produced carbon dioxide that combined with dissolved iron from the groundwater. This process formed siderite in the sediments surrounding the remains, forming detailed casts of their structure. Lithification of the sediments formed protective nodules of ironstone around the now fossilized remains. This mode of preservation is known as authigenic mineralisation.\n\nThe fossiliferous concretions are found in the Mazon River area of Grundy, Will, Kankakee, and Livingston counties. Additional fossils are found in LaSalle County, Illinois; between the Vermilion River and Marseilles, Illinois. The ironstone concretions are recovered from exposures along streams, roadcuts and in active or abandoned coal mine areas.\n\nWhile professional geologists commonly mispronounced it MAY-zon, the correct local pronunciation is Muh-ZOHN. ()\n\nMost concretions are found among the shale and sandstone that was piled up in either a spoil tip of an older underground mine, or ridges of the later surface mining. The Peabody Energy company operated several large strip mines in Grundy County that are now abandoned. They were named Pit 1 through Pit 11. The northern pits 1-8 are known for the Braidwood Biota with mostly terrestrial fauna and flora. Pit 11, which was located southwest of the town of Braidwood, Illinois, is known for its Essex Biota with a greater abundance of marine species. Pit 11 is now Braidwood State Fish and Wildlife Area, an Illinois state park. Fossil collecting is allowed at the park with a permit.\n\nThe site's importance was realized in the mid-nineteenth century: \"the nodules of Mazon Creek, where fragments of plants, even of the softest texture, have been preserved in their integrity\".\n\nThe Mazon Creek flora comprises over 400 species from at least 130 genera. However, the true number of species is difficult to determine. Paleobotanists name separate plant structures with different names by convention, inflating the number of fossil plant taxa. Paleobotanists are currently determining which taxa are valid.\n\nMazon Creek flora includes: lycopsids, related to modern club moss, with arborescent forms named \"Lepidophloios\", \"Sigillaria\" and \"Lepidodendron\", and herbaceous forms called \"Lycopodites\" and \"Cormophyton\"; sphenopsids like \"Calamites\" a tree-like horsetail relative, with common foliage names of \"Annularia\" and \"Asterophyllites\", and a vine-like form called \"Sphenophyllum\"; Pteridophyta as marattitalean tree ferns and Filicales and Zygopteridales understory ferns, with common foliage names of \"Pecopteris\", \"Acitheca\" and \"Lobatopteris\"; pteridosperms, also known as seed ferns, an extinct group of plants that grew both as trees and smaller shrubs, with features like pinnated leaves similar to true ferns, but reproduced by seeds instead of spores; they had common foliage names \"Mariopteris\", \"Alethopteris\", \"Odontopteris\", \"Neuropteris\", \"Laveineopteris\" and \"Macroneuropteris\"; extinct gymnosperm \"Cordaites\", believed to be closely related to and sharing many features with modern conifers.\n\nThe Mazon Creek fauna has over 320 species of animals that have been identified. The fauna is divided into two components: the marine Essex fauna and the land and freshwater Braidwood fauna, that were washed into the deltaic sediments.\n\nThe Essex fauna includes jellyfish, sea worms, snails, saltwater clams, shrimp, sea scorpions, cephalopods and fish.\nThe most common species found is the \"Essexella\" jellyfish. It consists of 42% of all fossil finds in the Essex biota. The Essex area also includes the most famous faunal member of the Illinois' state fossil \"Tullimonstrum\", known popularly as the \"Tully Monster\". Other well-documented organisms include the crustacean \"Belotelson\" and the possible hemichordate \"Etacystis\".\n\nThe Braidwood fauna includes insects, millipedes, centipedes, scorpions, spiders, other arachnids, amphibians, freshwater fish, freshwater shrimps, freshwater horseshoe crabs and ostracods. The oldest known beetle has been described from the Braidwood fauna.\n\nThree species of centipede have been described from Mazon Creek.

{"id": "1961396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1961396", "title": "Cold Pizza", "text": "Cold Pizza\n\nCold Pizza is an American television sports morning talk show that aired weekdays on ESPN2 from 2003 to 2007. The show's style was more akin to \"Good Morning America\" than \"SportsCenter\"s straight news and highlights format. It included daily sports news, interviews with sports journalists, athletes, and personalities, and an assortment of other sports and non-sports topics.\n\nThe original co-hosts were Jay Crawford and Kit Hoover, with Thea Andrews serving as correspondent, and Leslie Maxie as the news anchor. The ESPN executive in charge of the program was James Cohen, who helped develop ESPN's popular talk show, \"Pardon the Interruption\". The show was part of ESPN Original Entertainment overseen by ESPN programming chief Mark Shapiro The executive producer/creator was Brian Donlon and he was assisted by Consulting Producer Steve Friedman, who oversaw NBC's Today Show during some of its most innovative and highly rated periods. The program was produced at Atlantic Video which was overseen by Todd Mason.\n\nWhen it launched on October 20, 2003 it started at 7 am ET, but moved to 8 am just short of its one-year anniversary in an attempt to get male viewers who may be awaking a little later. The show repeated at 10 am for the West Coast and often updated the show for the west coast feed.\n\nAlthough \"Cold Pizza\" was simulcast on ESPN2HD, it was not produced or presented in high definition. On October 2, 2006, DirecTV became the presenting sponsor with the show titled as \"Cold Pizza presented by DirecTV\".\n\nIn the fall of 2004, in an attempt to heighten the sports news content of the program, newspaper columnists Woody Paige and Skip Bayless were added in a series of segments called 1st & 10. Moderated by Crawford, the segment aired four times per show covering 10 topics (just like in football where teams have four downs to cover 10 yards for a first down). Paige and Bayless would debate, discuss and cajole each other on the sports headlines of the day. By December 2004, re-edited segments and new wraps were transformed into a new half-hour program using the same name which aired on ESPN at 3 pm ET.\n\nIn March 2005, change came in front of the camera and behind the scenes. Kit Hoover and Thea Andrews were replaced by SportsCenter anchor Dana Jacobson. At the same time, Brian Donlon left as executive producer of Cold Pizza and 1st & 10 and was replaced by SportsCenter veteran producer Mike McQuade. More change followed, on November 28, 2006, Paige left the program citing health and personal reasons, leaving New York to return to the \"Denver Post\", where he had been a longtime writer. He was not the last Cold Pizza member to leave the New York City studio location. In May 2007, the entire program shifted production to ESPN's Bristol headquarters. The final edition of \"Cold Pizza\" aired on May 4, 2007. The following Monday, May 7, the show was replaced by a very similar program, \"ESPN First Take\", which initially maintained many features of \"Cold Pizza\", but instead produced in high definition at ESPN's headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut. First Take (by this time with ESPN dropped from the show name) would eventually return to New York City in 2018 at the newly reconstructed Pier 17 at South Street Seaport.\n\n\"Cold Pizza\" was notable for having its own version of ESPN's \"BottomLine\", as their ticker not only gave sports scores, but also news headlines and weather forecasts from sports cities and is shown in its own color scheme. It also functioned differently: it constantly scrolled, while other ESPN \"BottomLines\" usually \"flip\" through the different scores, scrolling only for long statistical lines. This graphic was discontinued in the summer of 2006, when the \"BottomLine\" was changed to resemble those of other ESPN programs.\n\nThe program has gone on site for games and events quite often. On the road shows have included trips to Super Bowl XXXIX and XL and the Caesars Palace hotel and casino in Las Vegas. In 2004 the show had a regular series \"Cold Pizza on Campus\" where it went to colleges across the country big (such as Michigan State) and small (Mount Union College, a Division III football powerhouse. In an effort to save costs Friday's shows eventually originated from the \"College Gameday\" site. They went to New Orleans on September 25, 2006 for the re-opening of the Louisiana Superdome when the New Orleans Saints returned home to play the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nThe program also visited non-sports venues such as the Golden Globes and 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston and Republican Convention in New York (which was held at Madison Square Garden directly across from Cold Pizza's Manhattan studio). The show's coverage of the intersection of politics generated positive reviews and media attention for the program. Appearing on Capital Report on CNBC on July 21, Cold Pizza Executive Producer Brian Donlon said “We’re a sports network and what we try to do is sit in the middle of the intersection of sports and sports lifestyles. If you look at the list of speakers, the list of delegates, some of the events, some of the parties -– there’s a Yankees-Red Sox game that kicks off the Democratic National Convention. The intersection of sports and politics is rich with stories and we’re going to be there to cover each and every one of them.”\n\nGuests on the show have included Senator John McCain, Senator John Edwards, Rep.Dick Gephardt, Hank Aaron, rock star Bob Seger, who also served as the show's NBA analyst during the 2004 NBA Finals which featured the rocker's hometown Detroit Pistons, Pete Rose, Dennis Rodman, José Canseco, Senator Tom Davis, Mike Krzyzewski, Nick Lachey, X-Play Co-Host Morgan Webb and even the man that caught Barry Bonds' 715th home run ball.\n\nOn January 25, 2007 \"MediaWeek\" reported that ESPN would announce \"Cold Pizza\"s move from New York to the ESPN campus in Bristol, Connecticut. In addition to being able to cut costs and produce the program in high definition, the new locale allowed more live appearances by ESPN analysts (as opposed to satellite or telephone interviews). However, the move reduced the amount of live appearances by celebrities and non-sports figures. The official chronology shows that \"Cold Pizza\" ended on May 4, and was replaced by a new show, \"ESPN First Take\", on May 7, though nearly all of the former show's features were incorporated into the new show.\n\nFrom the show's inception through 2005, its format was similar to traditional network television morning shows such as \"Good Morning America\" and \"The Today Show\", featuring discussion among the hosts on entertainment and sports topics. After poor initial ratings, the format was changed to be similar to that of \"SportsCenter\" and \"Pardon the Interruption\", including sports headlines, analysis, and debate. Because of the format change, hosts Hoover and Maxie were let go due to lack of a sports journalism background, and Jacobson, Paige, and Bayless joined. Co-host Andrews was transferred by ESPN to Los Angeles to co-host ESPN2's new evening entertainment news show, \"ESPN Hollywood\". That show was cancelled in January 2006, and Andrews remained with ESPN until November 2006, when she left the company to work as a correspondent for \"Entertainment Tonight\".\n\nThe most recent format of the program featured the introduction graphic introducing the hosts and a show rundown. Following that was \"The Top Story\" of the sports world and an appropriate guest, followed by the \"Morning Headlines,\" which included about four or five news items from around sports. The headline segment was repeated at the top of the second hour.\n\nAt 20 and 40 past the first and second hour, Crawford, Bayless and Paige (or a guest contributor after Paige's departure) were featured in segments entitled \"1st and 10,\" which were edited into a stand-alone show that aired later in the day. The \"Morning Slice,\" a look at offbeat sports video, was also part of the program.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February 2006, Texas Tech head basketball coach Bobby Knight was promoting a new reality show for ESPN entitled \"Knight School\". Jacobson asked Knight at the end of the interview if he was interested in returning to his old coaching job at Indiana University. This made Knight angry, which ultimately led to him walking out of the interview. Jacobson was not at work the next day, but not because of the Knight incident; she had a planned vacation day, according to the network.\n\n\n\n"}

Gvaladze was a descendant of David II, King of imereti in 1784-1790.\n\nHaving graduated from the Gymnasium at the Tbilisi State University in 1920, he joined the National Army of the Democratic Republic of Georgia in July, 1920 and took part in the battles against the invading Red and Turkish armies in Kojory-Tabakhmela (near Tbilisi) and Batumi in February–March, 1921. On February 20, 1921 Gvaladze was decorated with the Military Cross of \"Tetri Giorgi\" (\"White Giorgi\").\n\nAfter the Bolshevik takeover of the Georgian government, he was demobilized. In 1926 Gvaladze graduated from the Department of Law of the Social-Economic Faculty of the Tbilisi State University (TSU). Since April, 1921 he was involved in the underground activities of the Georgian Menshevik Party to which he was a member in 1917-1923.\n\nIn 1926-1932 Gvaladze was a member of the Board of the Defending Lawyers of Georgia, and lectured at the Pedagogical Institute in Gori from 1935 to 1937. His articles were systematically published in the Georgian press of 1916-1928. In 1921-1932 Gvaladzes journalistic papers were published in the Georgian emigrant press also (\"Tavisupali Sakartvelo\", \"Tetri Giorgi\", etc. Pseudonyms: \"G.\", \"Geno\", etc.). In spite of continuing social activity under the Soviet government, he never abandoned his political positions and led, from 1926, the underground conspirative group of the Georgian national political organization Tetri Giorgi. Earlier, on May 26, 1922, on the fourth anniversary of the independence of Georgia, he was one of the organizers of the first mass anti-Soviet demonstration in Tbilisi and was arrested by the GPU. In 1923, he joined an underground anti-Bolshevik bloc of the Georgian political opposition known as the Committee for Independence of Georgia and represented it in the Kakheti district where he was involved in preparation of an armed rebellion in August, 1924. He was arrested on September 5, 1924, but was released due to a declared amnesty in March, 1925. On August 10, 1937, during the Great Purge, he was rearrested along with his associates from the \"Tetri Giorgi\" conspirative group and shot in Tbilisi on October 15, 1937.\n\n"}

Lamade Stadium (pronounced \"LAM-a-day\") is a baseball stadium in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Each year, along with Little League Volunteer Stadium, it hosts the Little League World Series. The playing field is two-thirds the size of a professional baseball field, with basepaths, a mound, and after modification in 2006, outfield fences at , forming one-fourth of a true circle. Stadium seating capacity is 8,000 to 10,000, much of which is bench seating, while large berms surrounding the stadium provide additional seating allowing over 40,000 spectators.\n\nOriginally called Howard J. Lamade Memorial Field, the ballpark opened for the tournament. Howard J. Lamade was the son of \"Grit\" newspaper founder Dietrick Lamade. The younger Lamade was a vice president at Grit Publishing, and served on the board of directors for Little League Baseball in the 1950s. A donation from Grit Publishing was used to purchase land where the stadium is located. The ballpark received its current name in 1968, when the original wood and steel stands were replaced with a concrete stadium.\n\nLights were added in 1992 to facilitate night game play in conjunction with expansion of the series to round robin play.\n\nIn 2006, the fences were moved back to to all fields. This was done because home runs were becoming too common. Other renovations included the extension of the stadium roofs to the end of the grandstands, and some bleachers replaced with individual seats with backs, increasing seating of that type from approximately 600 to 1500.\n\nOn August 19, , Lamade Stadium set an attendance record for the game between La Grange, Kentucky, and Clinton County, Pennsylvania, with 41,848 people in the stands and on the hill.

{"id": "1961488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1961488", "title": "Ferrocerium", "text": "Ferrocerium\n\nFerrocerium is a synthetic pyrophoric alloy that produces hot sparks that can reach temperatures of when rapidly oxidized by the process of striking the rod, thereby fragmenting it and exposing those fragments to the oxygen in the air. This property allows it to have many commercial applications, such as the ignition source for lighters (where it is often known by the misleading name \"flint\"), strikers for gas welding and cutting torches, deoxidization in metallurgy, and ferrocerium rods (also called ferro rods, flint-spark-lighters and wrongly \"flint-and-steel\" as this is the name of a different type of lighter using a section of high carbon steel and a natural flint). Due to ferrocerium's ability to ignite in adverse conditions, rods of ferrocerium are commonly used as an emergency combustion device in survival kits.\n\nFerrocerium was invented in 1903 by the Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach. It takes its name from its two primary components: iron (from ), and the rare-earth element cerium. The pyrophoric effect is dependent on the brittleness of the alloy and its low autoignition temperature.\n\nWhile ferrocerium-and-steels function in a similar way to natural flint-and-steel in fire starting, ferrocerium takes on the role that steel played in traditional methods: when small shavings of it are removed quickly enough the heat generated by friction is enough to ignite those shavings, converting the metal to the oxide, i.e., the sparks are tiny pieces of burning metal. The sparking is due to cerium's low ignition temperature of between . About 700 tons were produced in 2000.\n\nFerrocerium bears no chemical relationship to the rock flint. The similarity lies in the fact that both materials have historically been used to generate sparks. In traditional flint-and-steel fire-starting systems (using natural flint), the hard flint rock strikes tiny iron particles from the steel, which ignite due to frictional heating. This is essentially the opposite of the mode of operation of a ferrocerium \"flint\" in a modern lighter, where the hardened steel wheel strikes particles of ferrocerium from the \"flint\". In a classic flint and steel system, it is the steel that burns, while in a ferrocerium system, it is the ferrocerium.\n\nA flint spark lighter (sometimes just called a spark lighter, striker, or flint lighter) is a type of lighter used in many applications to safely light a gaseous fuel to start a flame. It is most commonly used for Bunsen burners and oxyacetylene welding torches.\n\nA flint spark lighter works by rapidly rubbing a small piece of ferrocerium upon the sharp edge of any substance that is harder than the ferrocerium rod. Carbon steel works better than most other materials in much the same way flint and steel are used. This manual rubbing action, done by squeezing the handle, creates a spark, which ignites the gaseous fuel.\n\nAs tinder-igniting campfire starter rods it is sold under such trade names as Blastmatch, Fire Steel and Metal-Match for survivalists and bushcraft hobbyists. Some manufacturers and resellers incorrectly call them \"magnesium\" rods. Some manufacturers combine a strip of ferrocerium along with a strip of magnesium in the same item, to be used by scraping off flakes of magnesium and then striking the ferrocerium with a knife. The sparks from the ferrocerium will ignite the magnesium, which will in turn ignite the tinder.\n\nIt is also known in Europe as Auermetall after its inventor Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach. Three different Auermetalls were developed: the first was iron and cerium, the second also included lanthanum to produce brighter sparks, and the third added other heavy metals. In the Baron von Welsbach's first alloy, 30% iron (ferrum) was added to purified cerium, hence the name \"ferro-cerium\".\n\nA modern ferrocerium firesteel product is composed of an alloy of rare-earth metals called mischmetal (containing approximately 20.8% iron, 41.8% cerium, about 4.4% each of praseodymium, neodymium, and magnesium, plus 24.2% lanthanum. A variety of other components are added to modify the spark and processing characteristics. Most contemporary flints are hardened with iron oxide and magnesium oxide.\n\n"}

The piano was the instrument of choice for their family. Robert Wade, an uncle, was employed as a pianist by the New York and San Francisco ballet companies.\n\nWhen he was 10 years old, his family, which also included four girls, relocated to Pontiac, Michigan, near Detroit. During his adolescence, he studied classical music with Harold Deremier. At the age of 12, Vaughn experienced the genius of Art Tatum, who was visiting Deremier. Vaughn stated: \"I hadn't been exposed to music like that before.\" \"That was amazing,\" and shifted his focus to jazz. \nIn his mid-teens he was jamming in Detroit with other young musicians including Kenny Burrell, Paul Chambers, and Elvin Jones.\n\nVaughn graduated from Eureka College in Illinois with a degree in history while playing piano in area clubs. He and his sweetheart Beverle Jean were married, and the couple started a family when Sheila Denise was born in 1961. Two other children followed: Tom, Jr. in 1963; and Angela Suzanne in 1965.\nA strong interest in religion led him to enroll in Yale Divinity School, where he earned a doctorate in theology.\nHe entered the Episcopal priesthood, and in 1964 his first position was assistant to the rector at \"St. John's Episcopal Church\" in Midland, Michigan, two hours north of Detroit. Vaughn still played concerts at colleges and clubs sporadically, but the 8am Sunday service limited his travel. That same year Father Tom sat in with Gene Krupa's quartet in Detroit, where he caught the attention of producer George Wein.\n\nOne year later, Wein brought Vaughn to New York City, where he recorded \"Jazz In Concert At The Village Gate\" with Art Davis on double bass and Elvin Jones on drums. Vaughn was a featured performer at the 1966 Newport Jazz Festival, opening for Miles Davis.\n\nFather Vaughn left St. John's Church in Midland in 1967, deciding that Los Angeles would be more conducive to his two passions, music and the ministry. \"Cornbread (Meat Loaf, Greens & Devilled Eggs)\" was recorded and released, followed by \"Motor City Soul\" in 1968. He played in festivals and concerts during the late 1960s and early 1970s, and appeared on local television and national talk shows, including Johnny Carson, Steve Allen and Merv Griffin. All this was done around his church responsibilities.\n\nVaughn joined St. Martin-in-the-Fields Episcopal Church in Winnetka, California in 1968. Three years later, he performed a jazz concert in the parish hall to raise funds for the \"Fireside Room\", then began serving as assistant rector. When St. Martin's celebrated their 25th anniversary with a big barbecue, music and dancing, Father Tom played during the 1974 festivities. He was installed as rector in 1976, the year he recorded his last album, \"Joyful Jazz\". He stayed busy with the parish and raising his three children until 1984, when he needed hip replacement—both—and retired from active ministry. After that, he served as a supply priest, officiating services at churches when the rector was absent.\n\nFather Tom Vaughn reappeared publicly in 1990, conducting the memorial service for singer June Christy at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills). As part of the service, he invited a quartet of eminent musicians to play in her honor, but did not join the group himself, instead opting to listen and enjoy the music as a spectator.\n\nBy the early 1990s, his children were grown and Vaughn played at local clubs a few times each year; a 1990 performance at the Millennium Biltmore Hotel received positive reviews. He also hosted a public-access television cable show, \"All That Jazz\", and was considering a return to the recording studio.\n\nVaughn was interviewed by the \"Los Angeles Times\" in 1991 and asked why he chose to remain a priest rather than accept fame and fortune as a touring musician.\n\nNothing can move me at the deepest spiritual level like music can, (but) music was never completely satisfying. Music was something that came to me as a pure gift. Maybe it came too easily. The clergy came to me through hard work and learning. I felt called to the inquiries of the mind. Tom Vaughn didn't want musical notoriety. I've never made much of a fuss over it myself.\nAfter turning 60, Vaughn further reduced his public performances to perhaps once a year. He remained married to wife, Bev, and practiced for three or four hours most mornings for his own enjoyment.\nThat feeling, when it's right, there's nothing better – carnality, food, throw it all out the window. When I get in a groove, I'm detached, almost like losing consciousness, like flying some sort of super aircraft. It's close to an out-of-body experience.\nAt an interview in 1996, he acknowledged splitting piano time between playing the classics (Bach, Beethoven & Chopin) and improvising jazz with touches of blues and bebop.\n\nVaughn died March 4, 2011, according to comments posted on a YouTube video of Vaughn's recording of \"Battle Hymn of the Republic\".\n\nToday, Vaughn's version of Battle Hymn of the Republic can be heard every Saturday night at 9:00 pm EST on WABE 90.1 in Atlanta. The song have provided the introduction to H. Johnson's \"Jazz Classics\" radio show, for 21 of more than 26 years that the show has aired.\n\nAll of Vaughn's records have been out of print for many years, but his three children began compiling their father's work into digital form in 2006.\n\n"}

From 1979 to 1985 she was Poet Laureate of Maryland. Clifton was a finalist twice for the Pulitzer Prize for poetry.\n\nLucille Clifton (born Thelma Lucille Sayles, in Depew, New York) grew up in Buffalo, New York, and graduated from Fosdick-Masten Park High School in 1953. She attended Howard University with a scholarship from 1953 to 1955, leaving to study at the State University of New York at Fredonia (near Buffalo).\n\nIn 1958, Lucille Sayles married Fred James Clifton, a professor of philosophy at the University at Buffalo, and a sculptor whose carvings depicted African faces. Lucille and her husband had six children together, which included four daughters (Sidney, Fredrica, Gillian, and Alexia) and two sons (Channing and Graham). Lucille worked as a claims clerk in the New York State Division of Employment, Buffalo (1958–60), and as literature assistant in the Office of Education in Washington, D.C. (1960–71). Writer Ishmael Reed introduced Lucille to Clifton while he was organizing the Buffalo Community Drama Workshop. Fred and Lucille Clifton starred in the group's version of \"The Glass Menagerie\", which was called \"poetic and sensitive\" by the \"Buffalo Evening News\".\n\nIn 1966, Reed took some of Clifton's poems to Langston Hughes, who included them in his anthology \"The Poetry of the Negro\". In 1967, the Cliftons moved to Baltimore, Maryland. Her first poetry collection, \"Good Times\", was published in 1969, and listed by \"The New York Times\" as one of the year's ten best books. From 1971 to 1974, Clifton was poet-in-residence at Coppin State College in Baltimore. From 1979 to 1985, she was Poet Laureate of the state of Maryland. From 1982 to 1983, she was visiting writer at the Columbia University School of the Arts and at George Washington University. In 1984, her husband died of cancer.\n\nFrom 1985 to 1989, Clifton was a professor of literature and creative writing at the University of California, Santa Cruz. She was Distinguished Professor of Humanities at St. Mary's College of Maryland. From 1995 to 1999, she was a visiting professor at Columbia University. In 2006, she was a fellow at Dartmouth College.\n\nShe died in Baltimore on February 13, 2010.\n\nLucille Clifton traced her family's roots to the West African Kingdom of Dahomey, now the Republic of Benin. Growing up she was told by her mother, \"Be proud, you're from Dahomey women!\" She cites as one of her ancestors the first black woman to be \"legally hanged\" for manslaughter in the state of Kentucky during the time of Slavery in the United States. Girls in her family are born with an extra finger on each hand, a genetic trait known as polydactyly. Lucille's two extra fingers were amputated surgically when she was a small child, a common practice at that time for reasons of superstition and social stigma. Her \"two ghost fingers\" and their activities became a theme in her poetry and other writings. Health problems in her later years included painful gout which gave her some difficulty in walking.\n\nHer series of children's books about a young black boy began with 1970's \"Some of the Days of Everett Anderson.\" Everett Anderson, a recurring character in many of her books, spoke in African American English and dealt with real life social problems. Her work features in anthologies such as \"My Black Me: A Beginning Book of Black Poetry\" (ed. Arnold Adoff), \"A Poem of Her Own: Voices of American Women Yesterday and Today\" (ed. Catherine Clinton), \"Black Stars: African American Women Writers\" (ed. Brenda Scott Wilkinson), \"Daughters of Africa\" (ed. Margaret Busby), and \"Bedrock: Writers on the Wonders of Geology\" (eds Lauret E. Savoy, Eldridge M. Moores, and Judith E. Moores (Trinity University Press). Studies about Clifton's life and writings include \"Wild Blessings: The Poetry of Lucille Clifton\" (LSU Press, 2004) by Hilary Holladay, and \"Lucille Clifton: Her Life and Letters\" (Praeger, 2006) by Mary Jane Lupton.\n\nIn 1980 Clifton published \"homage to my hips\" in her book of poems, \"Two-Headed Woman\". \"Two-Headed Woman\" won the 1980 Juniper Prize and was characterized by its \"dramatic tautness, simple language … tributes to blackness, [and] celebrations of women\", which are all traits reflected in the poem \"homage to my hips\". This particular collection of poetry also marks the beginning of Clifton's interest in depicting the \"transgressive black body.\" \"homage to my hips\" was preceded by the poem \"homage to my hair\" – and acts as a complementary work that explores the relationship between African-American women and men and aimed to reinvent the negative stereotypes associated with the black female body. \"Homage to my hips\" and \"homage to my hair\" both relate the African-American body to mythological powers – a literary technique common among many literary works by African American women. Jane Campbell poses the idea that \"the specific effect of mythmaking upon race relations … constitutes a radical act, inviting the audience to subvert the racist mythology that thwarts and defeats Afro-Americans, and to replace it with a new mythology rooted in the black perspective.\" Therefore, Clifton utilizes \"homage to my hips\" to celebrate the African-American female body as a source of power, sexuality, pride, and freedom.\n\nLucille Clifton received a Creative Writing Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1970 and 1973, and a grant from the Academy of American Poets. She received the Charity Randall prize, the Jerome J. Shestack Prize from the \"American Poetry Review\", and an Emmy Award. Her children's book \"Everett Anderson's Good-bye\" won the 1984 Coretta Scott King Award. In 1988, Clifton became the first author to have two books of poetry named finalists for one year's Pulitzer Prize. (The award dates from 1918, the announcement of finalists from 1980.) She won the 1991/1992 Shelley Memorial Award, the 1996 Lannan Literary Award for Poetry, and for \"Blessing the Boats: New and Collected Poems 1988–2000\" the 2000 National Book Award for Poetry.

It contains information suitable for role-playing and wargaming a pulp-fueled World War II, featuring walking tanks and epic tabletop battles.\n\n\"Gear Krieg\" is an alternate history take on World War II, where the technology curve is a little more steep than in our own reality. Technology, such as personal jet packs, rocket fighters, and walking tanks, are developed during the course of the war, sometimes massively changing events and famous battles.\n\nFrom the game's rulebook: \"The world would indeed have been a different place had the Roaring Twenties not delivered the wonders promised by visionaries. Instead, war walkers now stride across the battlefield of Europe, huge supertanks thunder over North Africa, rocket fighters duel high above the Pacific, adventurers and superspies battle the Nazi forces in the shadows and scientists work feverishly in their laboratories to perfect the next doomsday weapon for their masters. Powered by advanced science, will the darkness of fascism spread across the world, or can brave men and women prevent it?\"\n\n\"Gear Krieg\" is based on the \"Silhouette\" game engine, a streamlined set of rules that is already described in \"Heavy Gear\", Dream Pod 9's other science fiction game. It can be played as either a role-playing game (RPG), a tactical wargame, or an hybrid integration of both.\n\nBoth the RPG and miniature games are built on the same basic rule mechanics. \"Silhouette\" is a realistic, simulationist system that defines characters in terms of ten base attributes (agility, knowledge, etc.), 5 derived attributes (health, etc.), and a variety of skills. Skill rolls make up the backbone of the system, which focuses on effect-based speed of play over grainy detail. The core mechanic involves rolling a number of 6-sided dice, taking the highest result and comparing it to a set threshold number. If the result is higher than the threshold the test is a success; if it is lower the test is a failure. The margin by which the test succeeded (Margin of Success, MoS) or failed (Margin of Failure, MoF) helps to determine the final outcome. Combat is handled by the same system, with characters taking penalty-inflicting wounds rather than depleting a set number of health points. As a result, the system can be lethal, especially on inexperienced characters. To keep the proper pulp high-action atmosphere, the game includes rules that allow players to twist the odds in their favor, in keeping with the conventions of the adventure genre.\n\nJust as its support for \"Tribe 8\" was starting to fade, Dream Pod 9 came out with their fourth RPG, \"Gear Krieg\" (2001), an alternate-history role-playing game set during World War II where technology was more advanced and thus the game featured technological anachronisms such as walking tanks. Like the company's earlier game \"Heavy Gear\", \"Gear Krieg\" could be played either as a role-playing game or a tactical one. The \"Silhouette CORE Rulebook\" (2003) offered a new standalone version of Silhouette that turned it into a generic system and also contained rules for converting d20 to Silhouette. The 'SilCORE' book – as it was called – was immediately followed by the \"Mecha Companion\" (2003), which offered d20 stats for all the mecha from \"Heavy Gear\", \"Jovian Chronicles\" and \"Gear Krieg\" using Guardians of Order's \"d20 Mecha\" (2003) mech description rules. The creation of the \"SilCORE\" book also allowed Dream Pod 9 to rerelease old games in dual d20 and Silhouette form, and the next year thus saw the release of \"Jovian Chronicles\" second edition (2003), \"Gear Krieg\" second edition (2003), \"Heavy Gear\" third edition (2003), \"Tribe 8\" second edition (2004) and the brand new \"CORE Command\" (2003).\n\n\n"}

Mathis has also played for the Miami Dolphins, Cincinnati Bengals, Philadelphia Eagles and Denver Broncos. Nowadays he participates in poker tournaments with the most current one being PSPC where he finished in 35th place.\n\nMathis graduated from Homewood High School in Homewood, Alabama, where he played football and competed in track and wrestling. He was coached by Bob Newton in football. In wrestling, Mathis won the 2000 Alabama 6A heavyweight championship. In track & field, Mathis competed in the shot put event (top-throw of 15.24 meters).\n\nAlthough he bulked up from to after signing with Alabama in February 2000, Mathis was redshirted as a true freshman. In April 2001, he was named the Paul Crane Most Improved Offensive Lineman for Alabama along with tight end Theo Sanders. He competed with Alonzo Ephraim for the starting center job during spring practice in 2001, but lost out. Instead, he beat out Dante Ellington for the starting right tackle job, making his first start against South Carolina.\n\nMathis started four seasons on the offensive line for the University of Alabama Crimson Tide. His first three years he played tackle, before shifting to left guard as a senior. He started 47 consecutive games beginning in the 4th game of his redshirt freshman year. He helped anchor an offensive line that paved the way for the Crimson Tide to lead the Southeastern Conference in rushing yards per game in 2004.\n\nMathis was signed by the Miami Dolphins on September 9, 2008 after Donald Thomas, their rookie starting right guard spot was put on injured reserve. The Dolphins released him November 8 after playing seven games for them.\n\nMathis played for the Cincinnati Bengals from 2008–2010.

Owned by Long Communications, LLC, it is sister to radio station WHKY (1290 AM and translator 102.3 FM). The two stations share studios on Main Avenue SE in Hickory. WHKY-TV's primary transmitter is located on Baker Mountain in southwestern Catawba County, with a secondary transmitter in the unincorporated area of Newell in northeastern Mecklenburg County (just northeast of the Charlotte city limits).\n\nOn cable, the station is available on Charter Spectrum channel 7 in the Hickory area and channel 18 in the Charlotte area (CW affiliate WCCB, which broadcasts over the air on virtual channel 18, is carried by Spectrum on cable channel 5 in Hickory and channel 11 in Charlotte). It is not presently carried by AT&T U-verse in the Charlotte market. Google Fiber carried the station until July 1, 2017. WHKY is also available on cable in Mountain City, Tennessee, which is part of the Tri-Cities television market.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on February 14, 1968; WHKY is the oldest independent station in the state of North Carolina. (Charlotte's WCTU-TV channel 36, now NBC affiliate WCNC-TV, was the first independent station in North Carolina, signing on eight months before WHKY-TV.) During the 1980s, WHKY-TV aired Major League Baseball games from the Cincinnati Reds. Also during the 1980s, the station had a secondary affiliation with NBC, carrying some programs that were pre-empted by the Charlotte market's primary NBC affiliate, WPCQ-TV. In 2002, WHKY-TV installed two new antennas: one for its digital signal and one which replaced its older analog antenna. The latter antenna's installation helped to increase WHKY-TV's analog signal coverage into the far northern corner of Mecklenburg County. As a result, the station was granted a must-carry claim, allowing it to be added to Time Warner Cable's systems in the Charlotte area; the station also began identifying as \"Hickory/Charlotte\" in its on-air legal identifications.\n\nIn 2004, WHKY-TV boosted its analog transmitter's power to 2 million watts. In June 2006, the station began to be carried on Dish Network and DirecTV's Charlotte area local station lineups, expanding its reach to cover two million people in North and South Carolina. The station's digital transmitter was relocated to Baker Mountain in the fall of 2011, with its effective radiated power increasing to 950,000 watts (equivalent to 4.75 million watts in analog); the station also launched a fill-in translator, whose transmitter is located just north of Charlotte (near the Charlotte Motor Speedway).\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nPreviously, the second and fourth digital subchannels have been affiliated with Jewelry Television, which is shown at various times on the main channel. The network was used as a placeholder until the additions of RTV and My Family TV on those respective subchannels. On September 28, 2012, My Family TV was replaced with PBJ. In November 2012, WHKY-TV began transmitting its main channel in 720p high definition, and in 2014 the main channel began airing Jewelry Television in HD for portions of the day. On March 1, 2014, PBJ was replaced on digital subchannel 14.4 by Heartland (which originated as the broadcast incarnation of The Nashville Network in 2012). On July 1, 2014, This TV was added to the second subchannel, making WHKY the fourth station in the Charlotte market to carry it. On that same date, Retro TV was moved to the third subchannel, replacing Tuff TV.\n\nWHKY-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 14, on February 14, 2009, three days before the original date in which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 40. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 14.\n\nThe station's current schedule consists primarily of locally-produced religious and entertainment shows; and paid programming; as well as weekday local newscasts, airing at 5:30 and 10:00 p.m.\n\n"}
{"id": "1961575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1961575", "title": "Doubleday Field", "text": "Doubleday Field\n\nDoubleday Field is a baseball stadium in Cooperstown, New York named for Abner Doubleday and located two village blocks from the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.\n\nThe grounds have been used for baseball since 1920, on what was Elihu Phinney's farm. A wooden grandstand was built in 1924, later replaced by a steel and concrete grandstand built in 1939 by the Works Project Administration. Subsequent expansion has increased seating capacity to 9,791 spectators.\n\nEach year from 1940 to 2008, Doubleday Field hosted the Hall of Fame Game, an exhibition game between two major league squads. Originally, the game and induction ceremony for new Hall of Fame members were held on the same day, a Monday. Starting in 1979, the induction ceremony was moved to Sunday, with the game played on Monday. Starting in 2003, the game was scheduled in May or June, to better accommodate the participating teams' travel schedules.\n\nAs MLB's last remaining in-season exhibition game, its results did not count in the official standings, and substitute players were generally used to avoid injury to starters. The curiosity factor of two teams from different leagues playing each other in this game outside of a World Series or spring training situation was eventually removed in 1997 with the launch of interleague play, further reducing the game's cachet.\n\nOn January 29, 2008, Major League Baseball announced that the final Hall of Fame Game would be played on June 16, 2008, between the Chicago Cubs and San Diego Padres, citing \"the inherent challenges\" of scheduling teams in the modern day as the reason for ending the annual contest. However, the contest was canceled on account of rain, making the 2007 matchup between the Baltimore Orioles and Toronto Blue Jays the last Hall of Fame Game that was played.\n\nNotes:\n\nIn November 2008, the Hall of Fame and the MLB Players Alumni Association announced the creation of the Hall of Fame Classic, an exhibition game involving Hall of Famers and other retired MLB players to be played on Father's Day weekend, and in recent years on the Saturday before Memorial Day. The inaugural Hall of Fame Classic was played on Sunday, June 21, 2009. The Hall of Fame game lasts seven innings or two hours, whichever comes first. In addition to the game, there is a parade and a home run derby beforehand. The game has been played annually since 2011. In March 2020 it was announced by the Hall of Fame that that year's game would be canceled \"in accordance with recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and government officials to limit opportunities for large gatherings and the further spread of the COVID-19 virus.\"\n\nThe Cooperstown Classic was an International League regular season game played in honor of the 125th anniversary of the league in 2008. The game was held on a Sunday afternoon in may between the Rochester Red Wings and the Syracuse Chiefs. The game was the third of a four-game series in which the Chiefs were the home team. The crowd for the game was very respectable and Major League Hall of Fame member Carlton Fisk threw out the first pitch. The game was postponed after the second inning after a rain delay in which Syracuse lead 1-0 and went on to win the following day in its completion at Alliance Bank Stadium. In an attempt to give the fans another game, the Cooperstown Classic Two was played on a Sunday in June 2009. This game was played between the Pawtucket Red Sox and the home team Syracuse Chiefs. The game was played in full with the Red Sox winning 15-3. This game was not played after that but many have expressed interest in it after the demise of the MLB Hall Of Fame Game in 2008.\n\nDoubleday Field is used primarily for amateur and American Legion ball; The Legends of Baseball rents out Doubleday for three weeks over the summer. The Cooperstown Hawkeyes of the Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League use the field during the summer, while Play at the Plate Baseball also has an annual event at Doubleday Field every September.\n\nNo professional team has ever called the stadium home, although in 1996 the Northeast League considered placing a franchise in Cooperstown; this idea was rejected because Doubleday Field has no lights, a necessity for a team in a pro league. Also, some felt that Cooperstown should be the home of all baseball, and not just one team. However, the New York–Penn League has played an annual regular-season game at Doubleday Field since 1991, with the team based in nearby Oneonta serving as the home team through 2009. (The team was known as the Oneonta Yankees until 1999, when they switched affiliations to become the Oneonta Tigers in 1999. The franchise moved to Connecticut in 2010, but has continued to host the Cooperstown game.)\n\n"}
{"id": "1961587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1961587", "title": "Ángel Cabrera", "text": "Ángel Cabrera\n\nÁngel Cabrera (; born 12 September 1969) is an Argentine professional golfer who plays on both the European Tour and PGA Tour. He is known affectionately as \"\"El Pato\"\" in Spanish \"(\"The Duck\")\" for his waddling gait. He is a two-time major champion, with wins at the U.S. Open in 2007 and the Masters in 2009; he was the first (and still only as of 2019) Argentine and South American to win either. He also lost in a sudden death playoff at the Masters in 2013.\n\nBorn in Córdoba, Argentina, Cabrera's father, Miguel, was a handyman, and his mother worked as a maid. He was three or four when his parents split up and was left in the care of his paternal grandmother. Cabrera stayed with her until he was 16, when he moved in a few feet away, to the house of Silvia, twelve years his senior, and a mother of four boys. They had a son, Federico, followed by another, Ángel.\n\nWhen Cabrera was 10, he became a caddy at the Córdoba Country Club, which he says almost became his home. He learned golf playing against other caddies for money. His fierce determination and powerful swing soon caught the eye of members, one of whom, Juan Cruz Molina, a local real estate magnate, bought him his first set of clubs when he was 16.\n\nWith his stocky figure and habit of smoking at every hole, Cabrera cut a distinctive figure on the course. He is also acknowledged as having one of the biggest swings in the game. His son Federico became a professional golfer in 2008 and entered the PGA Tour's qualifying school in 2011, but was eliminated in the second stage. His other son, Ángel, became a professional in 2012 and joined the Canadian Tour. The elder Ángel and his sons also compete on PGA Tour Latinoamérica.\n\nCabrera turned professional at age twenty and his first three visits to the European Tour Qualifying School were unsuccessful. On his fourth trip in 1995, made with Molina's financial assistance, he qualified for membership of the European Tour in 1996. Cabrera retained his card comfortably in his first three seasons and improved substantially to tenth on the Order of Merit in 1999. He has since finished in the top 15 of the Order of Merit on seven occasions, with a best placing of fifth in 2005.\n\nCabrera's first European Tour win was the 2001 Argentine Open, which was sanctioned by the European Tour on a one-time basis that year. In 2005, he won the BMW Championship, the most prestigious event on the European Tour outside the majors and the World Golf Championships. However, it was only his third European Tour win, a tally which was perhaps disappointing given his consistent form on the tour. At that point, Cabrera had also won seven non-European Tour events in Latin America, where the standard of play is much lower than on the European Tour.\n\nCabrera featured a highest of 9th in the Official World Golf Ranking on 2 October 2005. He was the top-ranked Latin American player for a number of years before the emerging pair of Andrés Romero and Camilo Villegas won PGA Tour tournaments in 2008. Cabrera earned enough money ($623,504) on the PGA Tour in 2006 playing as a non-member to earn a tour card for 2007. He has played almost full-time in 2007, 2008, and 2009.\n\nIn 2009, Cabrera announced partnership with Gary Player Design to collaborate on a golf course design business with a focus in Latin America. This coincides with golf, the Olympics and Brazil coming together in 2016.\n\nCabrera won his first major championship at the 2007 U.S. Open at Oakmont near Pittsburgh. He finished the tournament at 5-over, topping runners-up Tiger Woods and Jim Furyk by one stroke. Cabrera entered the third round as the leader at even par, after finishing the first round at 1-under, and shooting 1-over on the second day. He struggled during the third round, finishing 6 strokes over par, putting him 4 strokes behind Aaron Baddeley and two behind Woods. Cabrera rebounded and came back strong on the last day. He birdied one of the longest par-3 holes in major championship history when he sunk a putt at the 8th hole, which played at a lengthy on Sunday. Cabrera finished one stroke under par, bringing him down to 5-over (285) for the championship, just enough to secure his first career major victory. At a post-round interview Cabrera said \"Well, there are some players that have psychologists, some have sportologists, I smoke.\"\n\nCabrera became the first Argentine player to win the U.S. Open and the second to win a major, joining Roberto De Vicenzo, who won the British Open in 1967 at Royal Liverpool (Hoylake). Cabrera received the 2007 \"Olimpia de Oro\" (\"Golden Olympia\") as Argentina's sportsperson of the year.\n\nCabrera won the Masters Tournament in 2009 in a three-way sudden-death playoff, seeing off Chad Campbell after the first playoff hole, and defeating Kenny Perry on the second. On the first playoff hole, the 18th, Cabrera missed right of the fairway, leaving his ball stymied directly behind a tree. On his second shot, he hit a shot right of the tree that would have sent the golf ball onto the 10th hole fairway, but ended up hitting another tree about ahead, bouncing left and settling in the center of the 18th fairway. He and Perry both got up-and-down for par, while Campbell missed his par putt and was eliminated. On the second playoff hole, the 10th, Cabrera made par to defeat Perry, becoming the first Argentine to win the Masters. He was the lowest-ranked golfer to win the Masters, having been ranked 69th before the tournament.\n\nCabrera is one of three active PGA Tour members who have won both the U.S. Open and the Masters as of 2015; the others are Tiger Woods and Jordan Spieth.\n\nCabrera struggled with injuries throughout most of the 2010 season and was forced to miss a number of events after undergoing surgery.\n\nIn 2011, Cabrera was in the mix to win a second Green Jacket at Augusta when he was in the final pairing on Sunday, four strokes behind leader Rory McIlroy. Cabrera started the round solidly and even tied for the lead at one point during the afternoon, but bogeys on 12 and 16 derailed his chances. He posted a final round 71 which placed him in sole seventh, five strokes behind the South African Charl Schwartzel. This was however Cabrera's best finish in a major tournament since his win back in 2009. He missed the cut in the years other three major championships and failed to qualify for the season ending FedEx Cup playoffs, finishing 154th in the standings. His best finish of the season was a T6 in the fall season at the McGladrey Classic.\n\nAt the Masters in 2013, Cabrera was again in the final pairing on Sunday. After taking a two shot lead on the front nine, Cabrera proceeded to lose the lead and after failing to birdie the par-5 15th and was two shots behind leader Jason Day. Day then bogeyed two holes in succession and when Cabrera made a 20-foot putt for birdie at the 16th he tied Adam Scott and Day briefly for the lead. As Cabrera stood on the 18th fairway, up ahead on the green and playing in the penultimate group, Scott holed a birdie putt to take the lead. Cabrera hit a 7-iron to and knocked in the putt to force a playoff. On the first playoff hole, Scott's second shot was out, but rolled back off the front of the green. Cabrera's second shot also came up short, rolling back off the green and coming to rest behind Scott's ball. Cabrera's chip just slid by the hole. Both players then made par sending them onto the 10th for the second playoff hole. Scott and Cabrera hit their tee shots in the fairway and matched each other with approach shots which landed on the green giving both birdie chances, Cabrera with uphill and Scott a downhill right to left 12 footer. Cabrera's putt was a turn away from dropping in, giving Scott a chance to win with his putt. Scott made the putt defeating Cabrera and bringing Australia their first ever green jacket.\n\nAlthough Cabrera was fully exempt on the PGA Tour, he occasionally competed in Argentinian events on PGA Tour Latinoamérica, a developmental tour in Latin America whose 2013 members included former PGA Tour winners Carlos Franco and Ted Purdy. Cabrera won the 2012 Visa Open de Argentina and the 2013 Abierto del Centro.\n\nCabrera won the Greenbrier Classic in West Virginia on 6 July 2014, his first PGA Tour victory since claiming the green jacket in 2009. It was his third win in the United States, but his first non-major win on the PGA Tour. Cabrera shot a six-under-par 64 on both Saturday and Sunday to secure the title, winning $1.17 million\n\nCabrera had a down year on the 2015 PGA Tour season.

Although there is very little information about Yan Yan in historical records, he is given a much prominent role in the 14th-century historical novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\" as a general who initially serves under Liu Zhang before switching allegiance to Liu Bei later.\n\nYan Yan was from Linjiang County (臨江縣), Ba Commandery (巴郡), which is around present-day Zhong County, Chongqing. He served as a military officer in Ba Commandery under Liu Zhang, the Governor of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing); Ba Commandery was one of the commanderies in Yi Province.\n\nIn 211, Liu Zhang invited the warlord Liu Bei to lead his troops into Yi Province to help him counter the threat posed by his rival, Zhang Lu, in Hanzhong Commandery. When Yan Yan heard about it, he remarked: \"This is equivalent to sitting on an isolated hill and setting a tiger free to protect oneself!\"\n\nAround 212, conflict broke out between Liu Zhang and Liu Bei when the latter turned against his host and tried to seize control of Yi Province. In 214, Liu Bei summoned reinforcements from his base in Jing Province to enter Yi Province and assist him in attacking Liu Zhang. Zhang Fei, a general under Liu Bei, led troops to attack Jiangzhou (江州; around present-day Yuzhong District, Chongqing), which was defended by Yan Yan. Zhang Fei defeated Yan Yan, captured him alive, and asked him: \"When my army showed up, why did you put up resistance instead of surrendering?\" Yan Yan replied: \"You people launched an unwarranted attack on my home province. There may be generals in my province who will lose their heads, but there are none who will surrender.\" Zhang Fei was enraged and he ordered Yan Yan's execution. Yan Yan remained expressionless and said: \"If you want to chop off my head, then do it! What's with that outburst of anger?\" Zhang Fei was so impressed with Yan Yan's courage that he released him and treated him like an honoured guest. Nothing was recorded in history about Yan Yan from this point onwards.\n\nYan Yan has a greater role as a character in the 14th-century historical novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\", which romanticises the events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. In Chapter 63 of the novel, as in history, he is defeated and captured by Zhang Fei, who initially wants to execute him but changes his mind and spares him after feeling impressed with Yan Yan's strong sense of loyalty. Zhang Fei also manages to convince Yan Yan to switch his allegiance to Liu Bei. Yan Yan appears again later in Chapters 70 and 71, when he joins Huang Zhong to attack Cao Cao's forces at the Battle of Mount Dingjun.\n\n\n"}

Its properties were first recorded in 1970 by Drs. Brown and Goldstein, with the defining property being the ability to bind and remove modified low density lipoproteins (LDL). Today scavenger receptors are known to be involved in a wide range of processes, such as: homeostasis, apoptosis, inflammatory diseases and pathogen clearance. Scavenger receptors are mainly found on myeloid cells and other cells that bind to numerous ligands, primarily endogenous and modified host-molecules together with pathogen-associated molecular patterns(PAMPs), and remove them. The Kupffer cells in the liver are particularly rich in scavenger receptors, includes SR-A I, SR-A II, and MARCO.\n\nThe scavenger receptor superfamily is defined by its ability to recognize and bind a broad range of common ligands. These ligands include: polyanionic ligands including lipoproteins, apoptotic cells, cholesterol ester, phospholipids, proteoglycans, ferritin, and carbohydrates. This broad recognition range allows scavenger receptors to play an important role in homeostasis and the combating of diseases. This is accomplished via the recognition of various PAMP's and DAMP's, which leads to the removal or scavenging of pathogens with the recognition of PAMP's and the removal of apoptotic cells, self reactive antigens and the products of oxidative stress.\n\nIn atherosclerotic lesions, macrophages that express scavenger receptors on their plasma membrane take up the oxidized LDL deposited in the blood vessel wall aggressively, and develop into foam cells. Likewise, they secrete various inflammatory cytokines and accelerate the development of atherosclerosis.\n\nScavenger receptors are incredibly diverse and therefore they organized into many different classes, starting at A and continuing to L. This organization is based on their structural properties. Due to the diversity and ongoing research into scavenger receptors, the receptors lack an accepted nomenclature and they have been described under different names. In 2014 a new nomenclature has been proposed which has been used by some researchers, although no official recognition has been given.\n\n\nClass A receptors are a type II membrane protein who use their collagen-like domain for ligand binding.\n\nMembers include:Scavenger receptors type 1 (SR-A1) is a trimer with a molecular weight of about 220-250 kDa (the molecular weight of monomeric protein is about 80 kDa). It preferentially bind modified LDL, either acylated (acLDL) or oxidized (oxLDL). Other ligands include: binds to β-amyloid, heat shock proteins, surface molecules of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, hepatitis C virus.\n\nSR-A1 can be alternatively spliced which contains a reduced C-terminus, it is contained within the Endoplasmatic Reticulum and just like the unspliced version has a strong affinity for polyanionic ligand binding.\n\n\nCD36 and scavenger receptor class BI are identified as genes encoding for oxidized LDL receptors and classified into scavenger receptor B (SR-B). Both proteins have two transmembrane domains with an extracellular loop, and they are concentrated in a specific plasma membrane microdomain, the caveolae.\n\nMembers include:\n\nSome receptors that can bind to oxidized LDL have been discovered. \n\n"}

In the Australian court hierarchy, the Supreme Court of Tasmania is in the middle level, with both an appellate jurisdiction over lower courts, and decisions made by Court to be heard on appeal by the High Court of Australia.\n\nThe ordinary sittings of the Court occur in Hobart, Launceston and Burnie in Tasmania. The Court's Appeal division sits only in Hobart.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Van Diemen's Land (as Tasmania was then known) was established by The Royal Letters Patent of 13 October 1823 and commenced activities on 10 May 1824. The Court is the oldest Supreme Court in Australia and predates the Supreme Court of New South Wales, if only by a period of just ten days. The supreme courts of Tasmania and New South Wales were initiated through the New South Wales Act 1823, and this gave those courts jurisdiction over New Zealand. Sir John Pedder, after whom Lake Pedder is named, was the first Chief Justice of the court.\n\nThe first counsel to appear before the Court was Joseph Tice Gellibrand, who was appointed Tasmania's first Attorney-General, and took his oaths on the first day of the new Court. The first case before the Court was the trial of William Tibbs, who was found guilty and sentenced for manslaughter, receiving 3 years transportation.\n\nIt has unlimited jurisdiction within the state in civil matters and hears the most serious criminal matters. It is around the middle of the Australian court hierarchy. The Supreme Court consists of a Trial Division (also known as Original Jurisdiction) and an Appeal Division (or Appellate Jurisdiction). When sitting in its appellate jurisdiction in civil matters it is the \"Full Court\"; for criminal matters it is the \"Tasmanian Court of Criminal Appeal\".\n\nAppeals from the Appeal Division of the Court are to the High Court of Australia. It was previously possible to appeal decisions of the Court of Appeal or the Court of Criminal Appeal (both parts of the Appeal Division) to the British Privy Council, but this ceased in 1986 when the Parliament of Australia passed the \"Australia Act 1986\", which barred all such appeals to the Privy Council from Australian courts.\n\nCivil matters involving consent orders, or for disputes involving less than $50,000, are dealt with by the Magistrates Court except in exceptional circumstances.\n\nThe Court receives appeals from Magistrate Courts in Tasmania in both criminal and civil matters. Committal proceedings, which are used in criminal matters to establish whether there is sufficient evidence against an accused person to warrant the time and expense of a trial, were abolished in Tasmania in 2000 with the amendment of the \"Justices Act 1959\" (Tas). The \"Justices Act 1959\" now provides that where there has been a plea of not guilty by an accused, there must be an order committing them for trial in the Supreme Court.\n\nUnlike some other Australian states, Tasmania does not have an intermediate court division between the Supreme Court and the Magistrates Courts (such as a \"District Court\" or a \"County Court\").\n\nThe Supreme Court of Tasmania is composed of up to seven judges appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Executive Council, a body of senior ministers including the state Premier. the judges of the Supreme Court of Tasmania are:\n\nThe Associate Judge, a lower-ranking judicial officer previously called the Master, has responsibility for largely procedural matters in civil and criminal proceedings, and for some work in assessing the damages (amounts claimable) in civil proceedings.\n\n\n"}

During his lifetime in Ethiopia, he was commonly called \"Marqorewos\".\n\nEvidence of his life before arriving in Ethiopia has not been found, according to Paul B. Henze. E. A. Wallis Budge, in his preface to the second edition of his translation of the \"Kebra Nagast\", claims that Brancaleon was a monk who had come to Ethiopia to convert Emperor Zara Yaqob and debated Abba Giyorgis several times on religious matters; (Wallis Budge may have misremembered James Bruce's statement about Abba Giyorgis's opponent in that religious debate, \"We are not informed of the name of Abba George's antagonist, but he is thought to have been a Venetian painter, who lived many years after in Abyssinia, and, it is believed, died there\"—explicitly identifying him as Brancaleon in a footnote.) Francisco Álvares, who met Brancaleon while accompanying the Portuguese ambassador on his mission to Lebna Dengel in the 1520s, wrote that \"they say he was a monk before he came to this country\".\n\nBrancaleon arrived in Ethiopia between 1480 and 1482, according to an account of Francesco Suriano, who had visited the country, written in the latter year. When he arrived at the court of the Emperor (who was at the time encamped at Barar, which O.G.S. Crawford located to the southwest of modern Addis Ababa), Suriano found 14 Europeans residing at the court, among whom was \"Master Nicolo Branchalion\".\n\nBy the time Álvares met Brancaleon, the painter was very wealthy and well known in Ethiopia — although forbidden by the Emperor to ever leave the country. By this time, he had founded a studio and was unchallenged in his skill at painting icons, illustrating books, and decorating churches. \"Brancaleon's images of the martyrdom of Saint George and of the miracles of the Virgin Mary remained fashionable until the eighteenth century.\"\n\nHis best known work was a painting of the Madonna and Child that decorated the church of Atronsa Maryam, which caused much controversy. Beckingham and Huntingford, in their notes to their translation of Álvares account, repeat the account from the \"Paris Chronicle\" that Brancaleon's work\n\nThe painting, however, survived for several centuries until it was destroyed in 1704, along with the church, by an Oromo raid.\n\nIn 1973, the traveller Diana Spencer discovered some examples of Brancaleon's works at Wafa Yesus and at the nearby monastery of Getisamani in the Goncha Gorge, including a work by a previously unknown Ethiopian apprentice. Henze reports that he and Stanislaw Chojnacki verified that these works survived the Derg era. \"Though much has been learned about Ethiopian religious art in recent decades, it is still a challenging field where important new discoveries are likely to be made.\"\n"}
{"id": "1961624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1961624", "title": "Interleukin 4", "text": "Interleukin 4\n\nThe interleukin 4 (IL4, IL-4) is a cytokine that induces differentiation of naive helper T cells (Th0 cells) to Th2 cells. Upon activation by IL-4, Th2 cells subsequently produce additional IL-4 in a positive feedback loop. The cell that initially produces IL-4, thus inducing Th2 differentiation, has not been identified, but recent studies suggest that basophils may be the effector cell. It is closely related and has functions similar to interleukin 13.\n\nInterleukin 4 has many biological roles, including the stimulation of activated B-cell and T-cell proliferation, and the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells. It is a key regulator in humoral and adaptive immunity. IL-4 induces B-cell class switching to IgE, and up-regulates MHC class II production. IL-4 decreases the production of Th1 cells, macrophages, IFN-gamma, and dendritic cell IL-12.\n\nOverproduction of IL-4 is associated with allergies.\n\nTissue macrophages play an important role in chronic inflammation and wound repair. The presence of IL-4 in extravascular tissues promotes alternative activation of macrophages into M2 cells and inhibits classical activation of macrophages into M1 cells. An increase in repair macrophages (M2) is coupled with secretion of IL-10 and TGF-β that result in a diminution of pathological inflammation. Release of arginase, proline, polyaminases and TGF-β by the activated M2 cell is tied with wound repair and fibrosis.\n\nThe receptor for interleukin-4 is known as the IL-4Rα. This receptor exists in 3 different complexes throughout the body. Type 1 receptors are composed of the IL-4Rα subunit with a common γ chain and specifically bind IL-4. Type 2 receptors consist of an IL-4Rα subunit bound to a different subunit known as IL-13Rα1. These type 2 receptors have the ability to bind both IL-4 and IL-13, two cytokines with closely related biological functions.\n\nIL-4 has a compact, globular fold (similar to other cytokines), stabilised by 3 disulphide bonds. One half of the structure is dominated by a 4 alpha-helix bundle with a left-handed twist. The helices are anti-parallel, with 2 overhand connections, which fall into a 2-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet.\n\nThis cytokine was co-discovered by Maureen Howard and William E. Paul as well as by Ellen Vitetta and her research group in 1982.\n\nThe nucleotide sequence for human IL-4 was isolated four years later confirming its similarity to a mouse protein called B-cell stimulatory factor-1 (BCSF-1).\n\nIL-4 has been found to mediate a crosstalk between the neural stem cells and neurons that undergo neurodegeneration, and initiate a regeneration cascade through phosphorylation of its intracellular effector STAT6 in an experimental Alzheimer's disease model in adult zebrafish brain.\n\nIL-4 has also been shown to drive mitogenesis, dedifferentiation, and metastasis in rhabdomyosarcoma. IL-4, along with other Th2 cytokines, is involved in the airway inflammation observed in the lungs of patients with allergic asthma.\n\nIL-4 plays an important role in the development of certain immune disorders, particularly allergies and some autoimmune diseases.\n\nAllergic diseases are sets of disorders that are manifested by a disproportionate response of the immune system to the allergen and Th2 responses. These pathologies include, for example, atopic dermatitis, asthma, or systemic anaphylaxis. Interleukin 4 mediates important pro-inflammatory functions in asthma, including induction of isotype rearrangement of IgE, expression of VCAM-1 molecules (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1), promoting eosinophilic transmigration through endothelium, mucus secretion and T helper type 2 (Th2) leading to cytokine release. Asthma is a complex genetic disorder that has been associated with IL-4 gene promoter polymorphism and proteins involved in IL-4 signaling.\n\nIL-4 has a significant effect on tumor progression. Increased IL-4 production was found in breast, prostate, lung, renal cells and other types of cancer. Many overexpression of IL-4R has been found in many types of cancer. Renal cells and glioblastoma modify 10,000-13,000 receptors per cell depending on tumor type.\n\nIL-4 can primitively motivate tumor cells and increase their apoptosis resistance by increasing tumor growth.\n\nBrain tissue tumors such as astrocytoma, glioblastoma, meningioma, and medulloblastoma overexpress receptors for various growth factors including epidermal growth factor receptor, FGFR-1 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 1), TfR angiotensin transferrin receptor), IL-13R. Most human meningiomas massively expresses IL-4 receptors, indicating its role in cancer progression. They express IL-4Rα and IL13Rα-1-1, but not the surface γc chain, suggesting that most human meningiomas express IL-4 type II.\n\nIL-4 may also play a role in the infection and development of HIV disease. Auxiliary T-lymphocytes are a key element of HIV-1 infection. Several signs of immune dysregulation such as polyclonal B-cell initialization, previous cell-mediated antigen-induced response and hypergammaglobulinaemia occur in most HIV-1 infected patients and are associated with cytokines synthesized by Th2 cells. Increased IL-4 production by Th2 cells has been demonstrated in people infected with HIV.\n\n\n"}

The Nanman included multiple ethnic groups, probably related to the predecessors of the modern Zhuang, Tai, Miao (Hmong) peoples, and non-Chinese Sino-Tibetan groups such as the Bai people. There was never a single polity that united these people, although the state of Chu ruled over much of the Yangtze region during the Zhou dynasty and was heavily influenced by the Man culture. By the 7th century AD, the Nanman had become mixed with the Han Chinese and over time resulted in the modern population of southern China.\n\nThe early Chinese exonym \"Man\" (蠻) was a graphic pejorative written with Radical 142 虫, which means \"insect\" or \"reptile\". Xu Shen's (c. 121 CE) \"Shuowen Jiezi\" dictionary defines \"Man\" as \"Southern Man are a snake race. [The character is formed] from [the] insect / serpent [radical and takes its pronunciation from] \"luàn\" 南蠻蛇種从虫䜌聲.\"\n\nWilliam H. Baxter and Laurent Sagart (2014) reconstruct the Old Chinese name of Mán as *mˤro[n]. Baxter & Sagart (2014) provide a similar Old Chinese reconstruction for \"Min\" *mrə[n] 'southern tribes', which is also a name for Fujian province. Today, similar-sounding self-designated ethnonyms among modern-day peoples include Mraṅmā, Hmong, Mien, Bru, Mro, Mru, and Maang. The ethnonym Hmong is reconstructed as *hmʉŋ in Proto-Hmongic by Ratliff (2010), while Mien is reconstructed as *mjæn in Proto-Mienic (\"see Proto-Hmong–Mien language\").\n\nThe Man were described in the \"Book of Rites\" as one of the Four Barbarians associated with the south. They tattooed their foreheads, had inwards pointing feet, and ate raw food. Although various stereotypes and accounts are recorded in the \"Book of Rites\", little detail is actually known about their inner social hierarchies, their social customs, and the social interdependence among the tribes at that time. \n\nDuring the Spring and Autumn period, King Wu of Chu (r. 741-690 BC) undertook many campaigns against the Man, who rebelled during the reign of King Zhuang of Chu (r. 613–591 BC). During the reign of King Dao of Chu, the general Wu Qi also conducted campaigns against the Man. When the state of Qin conquered Chu, they found that the commandery of Qianzhong, corresponding to modern Hubei and Hunan, was still inhabited by Man people.\n\nUnder the Han dynasty, the Man were recognized as three distinct groups: the Pangu, Linjun, and Bandun. The Pangu worshiped dog totems and lived in the commanderies of Wuling and Changsha. They were also known as the Man of the Five Creeks. The Pangu had no unified leader but individual chiefs were acknowledged as local administrators by the Han. They wore clothes weaved from tree bark, used dotted patterns for their robes, wore short skirts, and painted their legs red. The Linjun lived further west in the commanderies of Ba and Nan, around modern Chongqing. Linjun was actually the name of a chief, who according to Linjun mythology, turned into a white tiger upon his death. Thus the Linjun worshiped the tiger. The Bandun Man (literally \"board shield\" barbarians) lived further west of the Linjun and were known for their music and heroic conduct in war. They supported Liu Bang after the fall of the Qin dynasty and contributed troops to Han campaigns against the Qiang people. According to legend, they killed a white tiger during the reign of King Zhaoxiang of Qin (r. 306–251 BC) and were therefore spared from taxes. \n\nThe Bandun Man rebelled in 179 due to unrest caused by the Yellow Turban Rebellion, but when amnesty was issued by Cao Qian in 182, the rebellion was ended. There was another brief uprising in 188 which amounted to nothing. Related to the Bandun were the neighboring Zong people, who became interested in the mysticism of the Celestial Master Zhang Lu and moved north to the border of his territory. When Cao Cao attacked Zhang Lu in the summer of 215, he fled to Duhu of the Zong and Fuhu of the Bandun for refuge. However Duhu and Fuhu surrendered to Cao Cao in the autumn and received appointment, with Zhang Lu following in the winter. The Bandun and Zong were settled in what is now modern Gansu province. In 219 Liu Bei's officer Huang Quan attacked them and drove several non-Chinese peoples north into Cao Cao's territory. The Zong therefore became known as the Di people from Ba. These Di people later founded the state of Cheng Han, one of the Sixteen Kingdoms.\n\nIn southwest China, the Nanman tribes rebelled after the death of Shu Han's founder, Liu Bei, in 223.The Shu Han chancellor, Zhuge Liang, led a successful expedition to quell the rebellion in 225. One of the leaders of the Nanman, Meng Huo, was captured seven times before he surrendered.\n\nAfter the fall of the Han dynasty, the Man became more integrated into Han Chinese society. During the period of Northern and Southern dynasties, the Man were able to remain independent by switching sides out of political expedience. The southern courts appointed Man chiefs as tax collectors for their regions. Many Man chiefs taxed their subjects lightly which resulted in some Han Chinese pretending to be Man people. On one occasion, a Han Chinese called Huan Dan even became a Man chieftain. The Man also rebelled at times. Defeated tribes were resettled at border garrisons or became slaves in the metropolitan area. Generally speaking, the trend was for the Nanman to migrate ever northward. By the 7th century the ethnic character of Man society was decidedly mixed, resulting in what is now the modern population of Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Henan.\n\nThe Nanman \"Southern Man\" tattooed their foreheads and were a totem worshiping people. Among their totems were those dedicated to tiger, snake, and dog deities.\n\nMeng Huo was a local leader of the Nanman, or simply a Han Chinese with great influence among them, mentioned in \"Annotations to Records of the Three Kingdoms\" by Pei Songzhi. In 225, Meng Huo rebelled with Yong Kai. He was captured by Zhuge Liang seven times before he surrendered. \n\nMeng Huo's role was greatly expanded upon in \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\", in which he is portrayed as the king of the Man and husband to Lady Zhurong, a descendant of the God of Fire. In the \"Romance\", Meng Huo was described riding a red horse, wearing a golden inlaid headdress, a belt with a clasp in the image of a lion's face, boots with pointed toes that were green, and a pair of swords chased with pine amber at his waist. Later he rode into battle on a red ox, wearing rhinoceros armour while wielding sword and shield. He enlisted the aid of his fellow kings Wutugu, who commanded an army of 30,000 invincible rattan armour troops, and Mulu, who rode a white elephant and deployed wild beasts in battle. Although his allies were defeated by Zhuge Liang's anachronistic gunpowder weapons and killed, Meng Huo was repeatedly captured and released until he surrendered and became a local administrator.\n\nIn the \"Romance\", Mulu was the King of the Bana Ravine and aided Meng Huo in his fight against Zhuge Liang.\n\nIn the \"Romance\", Wutugu was the King of Wuguo and aided Meng Huo in his fight against Zhuge Liang.\n\nThe She people and Yao people are said to be descended from the Man.\n\n\n"}

In that same essay, the writer also revealed having initially conceived the character to be the star of a series of prose stories, set in a post-apocalyptic Chicago.\n\nGrimjack is the street name of John Gaunt, a sword-for-hire, ex-paramilitary, war veteran and former child gladiator. He operates from Munden's Bar in the Pit, a slum area of Cynosure, a pan-dimensional city to which all dimensions connect.\n\n\"Grimjack\" began as a backup feature in issue 10 of the comic book \"Starslayer\". The character of Grimjack was created by John Ostrander and Timothy Truman, but the setting, the pan-dimensional city of Cynosure, predates the character. The \"Grimjack\" backup story was very popular with the readers of \"Starslayer\", and First Comics decided to give the character his own title. The GrimJack back-up story ran from issue 10 to 17. Grimjack guest-starred in the main \"Starslayer\" story in issue 18, in July 1984.\n\nIssue #1 of \"Grimjack\" was published by First Comics in August 1984, and ran until issue #81, in April 1991, with all stories written by Ostrander. Artists who worked on the series included Timothy Truman, Sam Grainger, Tom Mandrake, Jim McDermott, Steve Pugh, Tom Sutton, Paul Guinan, Martin Thomas, and Flint Henry. Throughout its run, with the exception of a few full-length issues (as well as #60 with its expanded letter column), \"Grimjack\" featured a back-up story in the manner of other First Comics series. From issue 2 to 69, the backstory was titled \"Munden's Bar\", a telling of events at the eponymous bar. The story brought a small amount of fame to the series for its occasional guest stars, such as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Starting with issue 70 a new back-up feature began, as John Ostrander felt that \"Munden's Bar\" was getting too far away from his original intent and he suspended it for reworking. In its place was his own serial entitled \"Youngblood\", drawn by Steve Pugh. \"Youngblood\" told the story of John Gaunt's troubled childhood, via flashbacks from a point in Gaunt's life prior to his first published appearance in \"Starslayer\", but after the Demon Wars. It concluded in issue #81. Although one of First Comics' most popular titles, after the company declared bankruptcy, it did not make it into print again until 2005.\n\nIn 1990, First published \"Demon Knight\", a stand-alone graphic novel featuring the James Twilley incarnation of Grimjack going back in time to the Demon Wars to try to change his fate. Although a stand-alone, the story ties in thematically with the \"Demon Wars\" flashback storyline taking place in issues 66–69 and Twilley appears in a panel of issue 69.\n\nFirst's \"Grimjack Casefiles\", a reprint series covering the \"Starslayer\" back-up stories and the first issues of the \"Grimjack\" series, ran a total of 5 issues from November 1990 to March 1991.\n\nFollowing their recovering the rights to Grimjack, John Ostrander and Timothy Truman teamed up again to publish \"Grimjack: Killer Instinct\", a 6-issue miniseries published by IDW Publishing. The miniseries, since reprinted in graphic novel form, serves as a prequel to the First Comics \"Grimjack\" series and shows John Gaunt's life leading up to his first appearance in \"Starslayer\" #10. The series met with critical acclaim for its art, storyline and original setting. With a script by John Ostrander and art by Timothy Truman, the series was lettered by John Workman and edited by Mike Gold. All of them had worked on the original \"Grimjack\" comic. IDW Publishing also re-issued the First Comics \"Grimjack\" run in a series of trade paperbacks under the title \"The Legend of Grimjack\". As of October 2007, 8 collections have been released.\n\nThe character was serialized in a new storyline, \"The Manx Cat\", as a Comicmix.com webcomic in January 2011. It has since seen print as a six-issue miniseries through Comicmix's arrangement with IDW Comics. The story involves \"The Manx Cat\", a statuette of such a cat that at first seems to be a simple MacGuffin like the classic \"Maltese Falcon\" of the novel and films by that name, but which begins showing malevolent powers. The plot thickens with time travel, reincarnation, and Elder Gods. Like most modern comics, it features digitally-created art.\n\nJohn Gaunt, alias Grimjack, was born in The Pit, a slum area of the pan-dimensional city of Cynosure, where both magic and technology, humans and aliens intermingle. His mother, Anya (née Laughton) died in childbirth. John had two older brothers, Nick (nicknamed \"Young Nick\" and named after their father, \"Old Nick\") and Jake. His father married Anya's sister, Maite (nicknamed \"Mouse\") and they had one child together, Joe. Joe was the only of his brothers for whom John cared, and he vowed to Mouse that he would watch out for him. Old Nick had one brother, Jack. Young Nick hated and resented John, blaming him for the death of their mother, the only person who loved him. Throughout John's life, Young Nick manipulated their father into hating John in hopes that he would kill John.\n\nWhen John was about five years old, Old Nick attacked and killed Jack in a drunken rage. He was sentenced to prison but later escaped. The day he returned home Mouse vanished. It is unknown whether Old Nick killed her. On John's eighth birthday, Old Nick, having decided that Gaunt was actually Jack's son, attacked John with a broken bottle. This caused the distinctive vertical scar that Gaunt carried through his life. Old Nick fell in the fireplace and burned to death\n\nFollowing their father's death, the four brothers survived on the streets by stealing. One night they broke into the house of a merchant to rob him. Jake killed the merchant when he discovered them in the house. Nick, Jake and Joe escaped but Nick knocked John unconscious and abandoned him to take the rap for the murder. John was found guilty and sentenced to fight in the Arena of Cynosure. The day he arrived in the Arena he vowed to kill Nick.\n\nGaunt joined one of the gangs of child warriors called \"Wolfpacs.\" During that time, Gaunt went by the name of \"Grinner\" and was known as the second-best fighter in the Arena, second only to The Dancer. Gaunt was released from the Arena at age 22 because, while he fought and killed, he refused to make his kills entertaining to the crowd.\n\nFollowing his release, Gaunt began a search for his brothers. Attacked and badly wounded in a street fight, Gaunt stumbled upon the entrance to the dimension of Pdwyr. There he was nursed back to health and met the love of his life, a woman named Rhian. He studied magic with Rhian's father, Maethe Mathonwy, but while Gaunt could summon power he did not have the inner peace needed to properly control it. Another Cynosure resident, Major Lash, found his way to Pdwyr and informed Gaunt that the city had been invaded by Hell itself. Lash convinced Gaunt to return to Cynosure and fight in the Demon Wars by persuading him that if the city fell the demons would find and destroy Pdwyr. The city's forces were able to repel Hell but demons invaded Pdwyr, causing the destruction of the land and the death of all those Gaunt loved, including Rhian. After burying his dead, Gaunt joined the Major's group of temporal bounty hunters, the Lawkillers, not knowing that it was Major Lash who had betrayed Pdwyr to the demons. Gaunt would not learn the truth for some 25 years.\n\nAt age 30, John Gaunt had a final fateful confrontation with his brothers. Nick shot John, leading Joe to draw his gun and shoot Nick. Jake then shot Joe and Joe shot Jake. John shot Nick. Jake shot Joe again, killing him. John then finished Jake. Nick shot John again and John killed Nick.\n\nAfter leaving the Lawkillers, Gaunt joined the Trans-Dimensional Police, Cynosure's police department. Upon quitting the TDP, he was enlisted as the first member of Cadre, a spy agency of the Cynosure government. After the events detailed in the \"Grimjack: Killer Instinct\" storyline, he abandoned Cadre and set himself up as a mercenary and private investigator in Cynosure. At some point he purchased the bar known as Munden's, apparently named after bartender Gordon Munden, from Munden's ex-wife.\n\nDuring a bloody conflict with the Lawkillers, Gaunt managed to kill two of Major Lash's men, Preacher and Grunt, but turned his back on Lash, disgusted with the senseless bloodshed and murder, including the revelation that the enemy he had killed months ago was his biological son. Lash seized this opportunity and killed Grimjack. Gaunt was shocked to find himself in Heaven, where he was reunited with his former love, Rhian. He was informed that for all his faults, he always stood by his friends, and for that he was judged worthy. But he soon discovers that The Dancer has reanimated Gaunt's corpse in order to murder his friend Blackjacmac. Gaunt was horrified at this, as Blackjacmac would likely go to Hell if he were to die at this point in his life. Forfeiting a peaceful Afterlife, but continuing to act for the benefit of his friends, Gaunt returned to Cynosure by animating a clone body of himself at an age several decades younger than his original body. In this body, Gaunt operated under the alias \"Chaney\" and had increased psychic sensitivity. Gaunt operated under this identity for several months, gradually re-establishing relationships with his friends, until he met a man claiming to be an incarnation of himself from 3,000 years in the future. This \"FutureJack\" tells Gaunt that when he left Heaven, he was barred from returning to either Heaven or Hell. Gaunt is condemned to be reborn eternally. \"FutureJack\" convinces Gaunt that his doom is tied to the fate of Cynosure and to accompany him on a mission to hasten the destruction of the city. During the mission Gaunt realizes that \"FutureJack\" is lying to him and shoots him. \"FutureJack\" is apparently destroyed.\n\nGrimjack was reborn as James Edgar Twilley, the son of a rich Cynosure family. Initially unaware of his past life, Twilley began remembering at around age 14 when he witnessed a thug murdering a jock who bullied him in high school. Twilley murdered the thug and marked himself with the trademark Grimjack scar of his previous life. Twilley went underground, disappearing from his family and friends as he set about re-learning his past skills. When he was ready, Twilley showed up at Munden's and, using a clause written into the ownership contract of the bar, claimed his identity as well as the bar. Sometime later, his family, distraught over the changes that their son had undergone, kidnapped him and forced him into a personality restructuring therapy to erase the troubling memories, but when presented with a copy of John Gaunt as supposed proof that Twilley's memories were false, he flew in a frenzy and ripped out the Gaunt copy's throat with his teeth. Discovering his family's manipulations, James Twilley left his family and assumed once again the street name of Grimjack with Munden's Bar as his base of operations. James Twilley died in issue #81 of \"Grimjack\", concluding First Comics' run.\n\nGrimjack's first published appearance was in a back-up story in First's \"Warp\", \"The Dogs of War\" featuring the character Sargon, Mistress of War. The story opens in Munden's Bar and Gaunt appears in shadow in one panel, although this was not known at the time. Ostrander identified this figure as Gaunt years later. In addition to his own series, Grimjack made appearances in two \"Munden's Bar\" specials and a few First Comics crossover specials including \"The Gift\" and \"Crossroads\". Away from First, Gaunt's corpse made a one-panel appearance as a sight gag in issue #5 of the DC Comics horror anthology title \"Wasteland\".\n\nIn the fourth chapter of his 1986 Amber novel \"Blood of Amber\", Roger Zelazny introduced a character named \"Old John,\" who works as an emissary for the King of Amber. Old John is described as having a \"nasty-looking scar running both above and below his left eye\" and a \"nasty grin,\" wearing a dark feathered hat. Zelazny, a fan of the Grimjack series since its premiere issue, later contributed the introduction to the Grimjack graphic novel \"Demon Knight\". In the short story \"The Shroudling and the Guisel,\" published posthumously in \"Amberzine\" #8, Zelazny refers to Grimjack by name: \"I stood among the grave markers of unknown mortals—Dennis Colt, Remo Williams, John Gaunt—and swore to be her champion if ever she needed one.\" This story was later reprinted in the Zelazny collection \"Manna from Heaven\".\n\nFollowing the bankruptcy of First Comics in 1991, the legal rights to \"Grimjack\" became tied up with First Comics' other assets. Ken F. Levin, co-founder of First Comics, and Mike Gold, \"Grimjack\"'s original editor, set out to free the rights to the character from legal limbo. There were several reports over the years that the problem was not the rights to Grimjack, invariably stated in these accounts to be owned outright by Ostrander, but those to its setting, the pan-dimensional city of Cynosure, which was the property of First Comics. The unique nature of the place was crucial to many of Ostrander's storylines, and some observers even considered it to be a \"character\" in its own right.\n\nAfter 12 years of efforts, all rights to \"Grimjack\" were released and a new company was founded, NightSky GrimJack Rights and Production Vehicle (Four Wheel Drive Model), LLC, with legal ownership to the character. John Ostrander and Timothy Truman are said to have \"substantial equity positions\" in the venture.\n\nJ. Michael Straczynski had reportedly planned to write a film adaptation of \"Grimjack\" during his time on \"Babylon 5\". He initially planned to produce the script during the summer of 1996, but timing conflicts prevented him from doing it. As a result, the project was put on hold, and has not been resurrected since. According to Straczynski, the film was budgeted for $30 million, and as scriptwriter, Straczynski intended to remain as faithful as possible to the source material.\n\nAt San Diego Comic-Con 2019, the Russo brothers announced their production company AGBO were developing a television series adaptation for Amazon. It's being written by Kevin Murphy and the Russo brothers will produce the show.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1961644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1961644", "title": "Hanover Street (film)", "text": "Hanover Street (film)\n\nHanover Street is a 1979 Anglo-American wartime romantic film, written and directed by Peter Hyams, and starring Harrison Ford, Lesley-Anne Down and Christopher Plummer.\n\nIn London during the Second World War, Lieutenant David Halloran, an American B-25 bomber pilot with the Eighth Air Force based in England, and Margaret Sellinger, an English nurse, meet on Hanover Street in a chance encounter.\n\nThe following day, Halloran's squadron is sent to bomb Rouen. The plane's starboard engine is hit, but the fire is put out. Cimino, the bombardier, begs Halloran to let him drop the bombs early and turn back, but Halloran does not care about the danger and orders him to wait until they are over the target, prompting him to angrily exclaim that he hates Halloran.\n\nHalloran and Sellinger meet again two weeks later in a secret assignation on Hanover Street. Although she is married, they rapidly fall in love. She tries to resist, but is drawn to the charismatic American. By contrast her husband Paul Sellinger is, by his own description, suave, pleasant, but fairly dull. A former teacher, he is now a trusted member of British intelligence.\n\nDuring the next few missions, Halloran orders Cimino to drop the bombs early, as he is scared of death because he now has \"a reason to live\", much to anger and disappointment of Hyer, the co-pilot. Weeks later, before take-off, Halloran hears something odd in the engine and turns back, forcing Patman to go in his place. That night, it's revealed that Patman's plane was hit in the bomb bay with the bombs still on the plane, killing all on board, and that if it hadn't been for that engine, it would've been Halloran.\n\nAshamed of his actions, Halloran volunteers for an undercover mission in Nazi-occupied France to deliver a British agent. At the last moment, Paul Sellinger takes the place of the agent, and himself joins the mission. His reasons are initially unclear, but he slowly reveals that he wants to prove himself.\n\nFlying over France, the aircraft is hit and the crew is killed except for Halloran and Sellinger. In occupied France, the two have to work together after Sellinger injures his ankle. Sellinger's mission is to proceed to the German headquarters in Lyon and, posing as an SS officer, photograph an important document that lists the German double-agents in British intelligence. Halloran agrees to help Sellinger. Making contact with the local French resistance, they disguise themselves as German SS officers and steal the documents. SS troops raise the alarm but the pair manage to escape after a lengthy car chase, and make it back to the farm where they had received assistance earlier. However, a collaborator betrays them and they are forced to flee again; though pursued by hundreds of Nazi troops, they successfully escape.\n\nIn London, Sellinger's wife finds out that Halloran and Sellinger are together and have come back home, with her husband wounded but alive. Going to visit him in the hospital on Hanover Street, she meets Lieutenant Halloran for the last time. They embrace and kiss, and he tells her that he loves her \"enough to let her go\", she goes in to see her husband as he goes back out into Hanover Street, where the love story had begun.\n\nPeter Hyams' career was in a slump after the failure of \"Peeper\" (1975). He wrote the script for \"Telefon\" but was not able to direct it. He then wrote \"Hanover Street\" and said \"that was a script that got a lot of attention and people wanted. I was offered an absolute fortune to sell the script but not direct it. I was running out of money and I had a wife and two babies.\" Hyams said his wife told him that \"if you sell that script I'm going to leave you' so he decided not to sell the script. The success of \"Capricorn One\" enabled Hyams to direct \"Hanover Street\". Finance was provided by General Cinema.\n\nThe film was said to have been inspired by the 1940 film \"Waterloo Bridge\" and \"other pix of that ilk.\"\n\nKris Kristofferson was cast as the male lead in the film and Genevieve Bujold as the female lead. Kristofferson was intrigued by the aerial sequences he had read in the script, as he had served as a helicopter pilot with the 82nd Airborne Division of the U.S. Army for five years. Bujold wanted to make the film because it was a love story; she also related to the subject matter of a married woman falling in love while married, because that had happened to her in real life. Christopher Plummer signed to play the third lead.\n\nHowever, Kristofferson dropped out of the film. Harrison Ford, in Europe working on \"Force 10 from Navarone\" with Robert Shaw, was persuaded to take the lead role.\n\nWhen Kristofferson dropped out, Bujold decided to leave the film as well. She was replaced by Lesley Anne Down. Down said she read the script quickly and only her part. \"I expected it to be sweet, sickly and over the top and it was,\" she later said of the film.\n\nAlthough United States Army Air Forces North American B-25 Mitchell bombers were featured prominently in \"Hanover Street\", the aircraft was a rare sight in England during World War II, except in squadrons allocated to the RAF's 2nd Tactical Air Force on strikes into Occupied France in company with the de Havilland Mosquito prior to, and after, D-Day. The typical light bomber in use by the 9th US Air Force based in England was the Martin B-26 Marauder, but the film-makers were forced to use the B-25 due to the few B-26 Marauders in existence.\n\nIn the film, Margaret Sellinger emerges from a Piccadilly line tube station called \"Hanover Street\". In reality there was no such station and, since Hanover Street links upper Regent Street and Brook Street; this would not, in any case, match the alignment of the Piccadilly line, unless there were a fictitious spur similar to that which ran from Holborn to Aldwych from 1907 to 1994.\nThe aerial sequences were mostly filmed at the by then-disused Bovingdon airfield using five North American B-25 Mitchell bombers flown over to England from USA specially for the filming. Scenes showing the B25s flying through flak on the bombing run were filmed at Little Rissington, the simulated flak bursts being provided by current British AA gunners.\nFord said he accepted the role \"because I had never played a love scene in all my years in the movies. I thought that the part would help me grow, but I hated making that film from start to finish.\" He said he \"never saw\" the film. \"They wanted me to promote it but they wouldn't show it to me and I'd never pay to see it. It was a terrible experience.\" \n\nThe film earned $1.5 million in the US in 1979 and was considered a box office failure.\n\n\"Hanover Street\" received decidedly mixed reviews from critics. Vincent Canby referred to that fame in his review:\n\nEvery now and then a film comes along of such painstaking, overripe foolishness that it breaks through the garbage barrier to become one of those rare movies you rush to see for laughs. What Peter Hyams has achieved with \"Hanover Street\", his new film about a wartime romance set in the London of 1943, is a movie that is almost as funny as Woody Allen's \"What's Up, Tiger Lily?\" which, if you remember, was a straight-faced Japanese spy picture that Woody took over and dubbed with a hilariously knuckle-brained English language soundtrack. The clichés were everywhere, but always just slightly out of place and inappropriate. This pretty much describes the unfortunate method of \"Hanover Street\", which looks as if Mr. Hyams had studied every popular romantic drama, from \"A Farewell to Arms\" to \"Love Affair\" and \"Love Story\", and then, when he left the screening room, had been hit on the head with a brick. ... [Ford's] more of a comic-strip character here than he was in \"Star Wars\", which was a live-action cartoon.\n\n\"Variety\" said the film is \"reasonably effective as a war film with a love story background. Unfortunately it's meant to be a love story set against a war background.\" It also notes:\n\"Down again distinguishes herself in a role that doesn't seem up to her standards, while Ford back in the pilot's seat again projects an earnest, if dull, presence. Rest of the cast is under-utilized. John Barry has contributed a score that evokes Douglas Sirk's glossy tearjerkers of the 1950s.\" Film reviewer Leonard Maltin had a similar critique, calling \"Hanover Street\", \"slick, but contrived and unconvincing.\"\n\nThe film has developed a following among film fans and aviation enthusiasts due to the flying sequences.\n\nPatsy Kensit was nominated for, but did not win, the \"Best Juvenile Actress in a Motion Picture\" award for 1980 from Young Artists Awards.\n\n"}

{"id": "1961670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1961670", "title": "Leverett George DeVeber", "text": "Leverett George DeVeber\n\nLeverett George DeVeber (sometimes spelled De Veber) (February 10, 1849 – July 9, 1925) was a Canadian politician who served as Member of the Legislative Assemblies of Alberta and the North-West Territories, minister in the government of Alberta, and member of the Senate of Canada. Born in New Brunswick and trained as a physician, he joined the North-West Mounted Police and came west, eventually settling in Lethbridge after leaving the police force. He represented Lethbridge in the North-West Legislative Assembly from 1898 until 1905, when Lethbridge became part of the new province of Alberta. He was appointed Minister without Portfolio in Alberta's first government, but resigned four months later to accept an appointment to the Senate, where he remained until his death.\n\nDeVeber was born February 10, 1849, in Saint John, New Brunswick. His great-grandfather, Gabriel DeVeber, had been a British army officer who was rewarded for his service in the American Revolution with land in New Brunswick, where his descendants had lived since. Leverett George DeVeber was educated in Saint John and Kingston before attending King's College in Windsor, Nova Scotia. He was a prominent rower in New Brunswick, and also played cricket and baseball and took part in shooting, hunting, and fishing events.\n\nHe studied for a year at Harvard College and then completed his medical studies at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London, from which he graduated in 1870. He then studied at the University of Pennsylvania for a year. He practiced medicine in Saint John for six years, before coming west to join the North-West Mounted Police as a surgeon in 1882. Over the next three years he was stationed at Fort Walsh, Calgary, and Fort MacLeod; it was in this last town that he left the NWMP to set up a civilian practice in 1885.\n\nIn 1885 DeVeber married Rachael Ann Ryan, who was born in Melbourne where her father was posted with the British Army. The pair would have two children: Marion Frances DeVeber, who married shipbuilder Francis Dunn and moved to England, and Leverett Sandys DeVeber, who worked in Toronto for the Bank of Montreal.\n\nDeVeber moved to Lethbridge in 1890, and became its Medical Officer of Health in 1893, in which capacity he continued until at least 1924. In Lethbridge he was involved in music: he took charge of his church's choir in 1891, and the same year sang at a local concert after the intended headliner, Nora Clench, failed to show up. He was also active with the Episcopalian church and the Canadian Order of Foresters.\n\nDeVeber was acclaimed to the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories in the 1898 election, and re-elected in the 1902 election. Though he was a Liberal, he wholeheartedly supported the efforts of Premier Frederick W. A. G. Haultain to conduct territory politics along non-partisan lines. As the federal government prepared to create two new provinces, Alberta and Saskatchewan, out of the Northwest Territories, DeVeber joined with Haultain in advocating the continuation of this non-partisan approach into the governments of the new provinces. This position put him at odds with the Liberal federal government, led by Wilfrid Laurier, who wanted the new provinces' governments to be Liberal. A Liberal, George Bulyea, was therefore appointed Lieutenant Governor of Alberta, and it was understood that he would appoint a Liberal as the province's first premier.\n\nAfter Alberta's two most prominent Liberals, Peter Talbot and Frank Oliver, made it clear that they were not interested, DeVeber considered himself as a possible candidate. Less than two months before Alberta's formal creation, he wrote to his colleague in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories, Alexander Cameron Rutherford, that the possibilities \"practically came to you and I, both of us weak enough God knows but we have the sense to see it.\" DeVeber's belief that he may be appointed premier does not appear to have been well-founded: his opposition to the introduction of party lines earned him the enmity of some Liberals, not least because it aligned him with Haultain, a Conservative. In the estimation of historian L. G. Thomas, DeVeber's fellow Liberals \"were not inclined to take him too seriously\" as a potential premier.\n\nOnce it became clear that he was not to become premier, DeVeber turned his ambitions towards the Senate of Canada. Though he had little interest in sustained involvement with the government of Alberta, he accepted Rutherford's (for Rutherford had been named premier) invitation to serve in his first cabinet as Minister without Portfolio. He made clear that he viewed the appointment as an interim one, to give Rutherford time to evaluate the many novice politicians entering the new province's legislature and, in DeVeber's words, \"ascertain who of the new blood will rise to the surface\". In keeping with the expectations of a government minister in the Westminster system, DeVeber ran in the 1905 provincial election, defeating Conservative William Carlos Ives by a comfortable margin in the Lethbridge electoral district.\n\nDeVeber did not serve long either as minister or Member of the Legislative Assembly: having received word that he was to be appointed to the Senate, he resigned from cabinet on March 1, 1906—exactly four months after his appointment—and from the legislature March 7. He formally began his term as Senator the next day. His time as an MLA was so short he did not sign the rolls in the Alberta Legislature and was never sworn in.\n\nWhile in the Senate, DeVeber chaired the Standing Committee on Public Health and Inspection of Foods. One issue examined by this committee was water pollution: beginning in March 1909 and for nearly a year afterwards, it studied the question in view of the increasing mortality from typhoid fever, and concluded, in the words of the University of Michigan's Jennifer Read, \"that the country required some form of legislation to manage the problem. However, it was at a loss about the form it should take and from what body it should emanate.\" As chair of the committee, DeVeber attended an October 1910 federal-provincial conference in Ottawa called to attempt to coordinate all Canadian jurisdictions' responses to water pollution. Besides recommending that provincial governments use their constitutional authority over health and municipal government to prevent undue water pollution from municipal sewage systems, it advised the federal government to use its authority over navigable waterways to prohibit the dumping of most waste into them; DeVeber supplied a draft bill for Parliament's consideration.\n\nAt the same time, DeVeber's colleague Napoléon Belcourt was championing a similar measure in the Senate (as an Ottawa resident, Belcourt was disturbed by the effect on the city's water supply by the dumping of waste upstream, in Aylmer, Quebec), and while doing so he quoted extensively from the report of DeVeber's committee. When Belcourt's bill came up for debate, DeVeber scolded him on the floor of the Senate for misrepresenting the committee's report as being much more supportive of the bill than it actually was; in the estimation of University of Ottawa law professor Jamie Benidickson, DeVeber's comments assured the bill's defeat.\n\nDeVeber remained a Senator until his death in 1925. Alberta's Mount DeVeber, located in Willmore Wilderness Park, is named in his honour.\n\n"}

It has unlimited jurisdiction within the state in civil matters (although it usually only hears matters involving sums of A$750,000 or more), and hears the most serious criminal matters.\n\nThe Supreme Court consists of a General Division (equivalent to the Trial Division in other states) and the Court of Appeal.\n\nThe General Division deals with serious criminal matters, civil cases where the amount claimed is greater than $750,000, criminal appeals from the Magistrates Court and appeals from other bodies such as the State Administrative Tribunal. The General Division sits in the David Malcolm Justice Centre for civil proceedings and the District Court of WA Building and the original Supreme Court Building for criminal proceedings.\n\nThe Court of Appeal hears both civil and criminal appeals from cases in the General Division, the District Court and the State Administrative Tribunal. It sits in the original Supreme Court Building.\n\nWhen required, Supreme Court judges may also constitute the Industrial Appeal Court and sit as a Court of Disputed Returns.\n\nThe current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is Peter Quinlan SC who was appointed to the position in August 2018.\n\nThe Supreme Court was established on 18 June 1861 when the Court of Quarter Sessions (a criminal court for serious matters) and the Civil Court were amalgamated. Sir Archibald Burt was the first Chief Justice of the court.\n\nThe Full Court of the Supreme Court was established in 1886 to decide both criminal and civil appeals. In 1893 the criminal appeals were transferred to the Court of Appeal which was then reconstituted as the Court of Criminal Appeal in 1911.\n\nThe Supreme Court, Full Court and Court of Criminal Appeal were effectively the one court with each judge able to sit on cases in any of the courts.\n\nIn 2004 the Full Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal were subsumed by the Court of Appeal, which, while still a division of the Supreme Court, has judges which sit solely on appeal cases.\n\nThe Supreme Court is currently constituted by the following judicial officers (in order of seniority):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court building has considerable heritage significance in Western Australia. In 1899, a joint parliamentary committee was formed to decide on the location of the new court building with three sites being considered. The locations were a site in Irwin Street, the old Government Boys' School on St George's Terrace and the current site. After a decision was made and a contract awarded for £55,888 11s 3p to RP Vincent and Sons in February 1901, an announcement was made to the public during March of that year. The foundation stone was laid on 2 June 1902 and would open on 8 June 1903 with WA Governor Sir Frederick Bedford present as was the Chief Justice Sir Edward Stone and the full court. \n\nThe two-storey brick building was designed by John Harry Grainger (father of Percy Grainger), Chief Architect with the Public Works Department of Western Australia. It is designed in the Federation Academic Classical style: a style that was often used for major public buildings of the time. The original design called for only local materials to be used with Donnybrook stone, Meckering granite and jarrah wood the choice. Stuccoed cement had to be substituted when insufficient quantities of Donnybrook stone of identical texture and colour were lacking for the building. Another change was the slate roof, when a galvanized roof was installed instead saving £5,425. Originally, the grand foyer was to be painted in colours reflecting those of the glass domes, but again shortage of funds dictated the substitution of whitewash. The foyer was more appropriately redecorated to celebrate the Court’s centenary in 2003.\n\nOn 11 July 2016, the Supreme Court's \"Registry and General Division (Civil)\" relocated from the original Supreme Court Building to the new David Malcolm Justice Centre located at 28 Barrack Street which is immediately north of the State Buildings complex.\n\n\n\n(Alphabetical list of bankruptcy files held by the State Archives.

Differential motion along the zone produces numerous earthquakes, the foci of which may be as deep as about . The term was named for the two seismologists, Hugo Benioff of the California Institute of Technology and Kiyoo Wadati of the Japan Meteorological Agency, who independently discovered the zones.\n\nWadati–Benioff zone earthquakes develop beneath volcanic island arcs and continental margins above active subduction zones. They can be produced by slip along the subduction thrust fault or slip on faults within the downgoing plate, as a result of bending and extension as the plate is pulled into the mantle. The deep-focus earthquakes along the zone allow seismologists to map the three-dimensional surface of a subducting slab of oceanic crust and mantle.\n\nIn 1949, Hugo Benioff introduced a method for determining elastic-rebound strain increments of earthquakes on a particular fault. He determined that the square root of an earthquake's energy is proportional to both the elastic rebound strain increment and the rebound displacement, and developed a way to determine whether a series of earthquakes was generated along a single fault structure. His research focused on the Kermadec-Tonga subduction zone and the South American subduction zone, and determined that in both locations, earthquake foci fall along planes dipping ~45° from the trenches. These planes of seismicity were later termed Benioff zones, or Wadati–Benioff zones for Kiyoo Wadati, who made similar observations independent of Benioff at the same time.\n\nThe angle of dip of the subducting slab, and therefore the Benioff seismic zone, is dominantly controlled by the negative buoyancy of the slab and forces from the flowing of the asthenosphere. Younger lithosphere is hotter and more buoyant, resulting in shallow-dipping Benioff zones, whereas older lithosphere is denser and colder, causing steeper dips. The Benioff zone spans from near-surface to depths of up to 670 km. The upper bound is just beneath the weak sediments in the toe of the wedge of the subduction zone, and the lower bound is where the brittle-ductile transition occurs. Most earthquakes occur within the 1000 °C isotherm, in the interior of the slab that has not yet heated up to match the temperature of the surrounding mantle into which it is being subducted. At depths below the thickness of the lithosphere, earthquakes are no longer generated by thrusting at the interface of the two plates, because the asthenosphere is weak and cannot support the stresses necessary for faulting. In this region, internal deformation of the still-cool down-going slab is the source of the earthquakes. Up to depths of 300 km, dehydration reactions and the formation of eclogite are the main causes of seismicity. Below 300 km, beginning at approximately the 700 °C isotherm, a mineralogical phase change from olivine to spinel occurs, and is thought to be the dominant earthquake mechanism of these very deep-seated earthquakes.\n\nIn some cases, subduction zones show two parallel surfaces of seismicity separated by tens of kilometres at intermediate depths (50–200 km). A primary example of this is located along Japan's largest island of Honshu, where the Wadati–Benioff zone is characterized by two well-defined lines of earthquake foci, with a distance between each line of 30–40 kilometers. A study of the global prevalence of double Benioff zones has found that they are common in subduction zones worldwide.\n\nThe uppermost seismicity surface is in the crust of the down-going slab and attributed to the dehydration reactions within this oceanic crust resulting in the formation of eclogite. The mechanism behind the lower zone of seismicity, located in the upper mantle portion of the down-going lithosphere, is still debated; the global ubiquity of double Benioff zones indicates that it must be a process that commonly occurs in subduction zones. Some of the suggested instability mechanisms include dehydration embrittlement caused by the breakdown of antigorite or chlorite in a hydrated peridotite upper mantle, and un-bending of the slab. Observations from seismic studies indicate that the lithospheric mantle at the intermediate depths where double Benioff zones occur is dry, which favours the proposed slab-unbending mechanism.\n"}

{"id": "1961717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1961717", "title": "Supreme Court of South Australia", "text": "Supreme Court of South Australia\n\nThe Supreme Court of South Australia is the superior court of the Australian state of South Australia. The Supreme Court is the highest South Australian court in the Australian court hierarchy. It has unlimited jurisdiction within the state in civil matters, and hears the most serious criminal matters. The Court is composed of a Chief Justice and as many other judges (called justices) as may be required.\n\nThe Court was established by Letters Patent on 2 January 1837, five days after the colony was founded. The Court is unique among Australia's state supreme courts in that it was established at the foundation of the colony of South Australia, as the notion of a supreme court was a part of the colony's founder, Edward Wakefield's theory of colonisation. Other Australian colonies only established their courts long after the settlement of the colony.\n\nThe Court was endowed with all the common law and probate jurisdiction of the courts of Westminster. The first sessions of the Court were not held until May 1837, presided over by Sir John Jeffcott, the first judge of the court. (The title of Chief Justice was not officially introduced until the coming into force of Act No 31 of 1855-1856.)\n\nAfter Sir John's death in December 1837, Henry Jickling was appointed as an acting judge. Although appointed as a caretaker judge, Jickling was responsible for two important developments: he codified the testamentary causes jurisdiction of the court and admitted the first practitioners of the Supreme Court in March 1838.\n\nJustice Jeffcott's permanent replacement on the Court was Sir Charles Cooper. Reports of ill health prompted Governor Henry Young to ask for the appointment of a second judge. As a result Justice Crawford was appointed. Justice Crawford was the first justice to wear a wig in court. Crawford died after only two years on the bench.\n\nCrawford was replaced by Justice Boothby. Boothby was a controversial judge who did not believe in the power of the colonial parliaments to enact laws. He arguably started the first constitutional crisis in Australian history when he ruled that the South Australian Constitution of 1856 was invalid, causing the Imperial Parliament to pass the \"Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865\". Boothby was removed as a justice of the Supreme Court in July 1867. He appealed to the Privy Council in England but died before his appeal could be heard.\n\nDuring Boothby's time on the Court, the first Queen's Counsels were appointed and the first circuit sittings of the Court took place in country South Australia.\n\nIn 1935 the Supreme Court Act commenced.\n\nThe Court exercises both original and appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters. The Court is a court of both law and equity. Though it has unlimited jurisdiction in civil matters, generally civil trials heard in the Court are those involving complex legal or factual issues or large sums of money. The Court also has exclusive jurisdiction in probate (wills & estates), meaning it is the only South Australian court that can hear such matters. In criminal matters, generally only the most serious crimes are tried in the Court (for example murder, treason, attempted murder and manslaughter) although the Court occasionally hears trials for less serious offences. Trials for murder and treason cannot be heard in any other court in South Australia. When exercising its original jurisdiction, the Court is usually composed of a single judge.\n\nThe Supreme Court hears appeals from the Magistrates Court of South Australia in both civil and criminal matters, and also from decisions of Supreme Court Masters and various other tribunals. In such cases, the Court ordinarily consists of a single judge. The Court sits as a Full Court (usually consisting of a bench of three judges) when it hears appeals from the decisions of a single judge of the Supreme Court or District Court, or from certain other tribunals. Some of these appeals lie as of right, while others require leave (permission) from either the court appealed from or the Supreme Court. When the Supreme Court sits as a Full Court in criminal matters (other than those originating in the Magistrates Court and Youth Court), it is commonly referred to as the \"Court of Criminal Appeal\".\n\nUnlike the supreme courts of some other states, the Supreme Court of South Australia is not divided into separate trial and appeal divisions. From time to time, all judges of the court sit in civil and criminal trials and as members of the Full Court and Court of Criminal Appeal. There is a division of the Court known as the Land and Valuation Court, which has jurisdiction over matters arising under particular State statutes dealing with planning and development law. Judges are assigned to this division by proclamation. In addition, particular judges may be designated to sit in the probate jurisdiction or assigned case management functions in respect of long and complex trials.\n\nThe proceedings of the Supreme Court of South Australia are normally heard in Adelaide. In civil cases the Court normally sits in the old Supreme Court building, while criminal matters are generally heard in the Sir Samuel Way Building. (The two buildings are located across the road from each other, on the corner of Gouger Street and Victoria Square.) The Court is empowered to sit in any place, including outside the State. The Court, consisting of a single judge, regularly travels on circuit to the rural centres of Mount Gambier and Port Augusta.\n\nSubject to statutory exceptions, an appeal is available by special leave to the High Court of Australia from all decisions of the Supreme Court of South Australia by virtue of s 73 of the Australian Constitution. Ordinarily, appeals are taken to the High Court only from decisions of the Full Court or Court of Criminal Appeal.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1961722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1961722", "title": "Jia Xu", "text": "Jia Xu\n\nJia Xu (147 – 11 August 223), courtesy name Wenhe, was an official of the state of Cao Wei during the early Three Kingdoms period of China. He started his career in the late Eastern Han dynasty as a minor official. In 189, when the warlord Dong Zhuo took control of the Han central government, he assigned Jia Xu to the unit led by Niu Fu, his son-in-law. In 192, after Dong Zhuo was assassinated by Lü Bu, Jia Xu advised Li Jue, Guo Si and Dong Zhuo's loyalists to fight back and seize control of the imperial capital, Chang'an, from a new central government headed by Lü Bu and Wang Yun. After Li Jue and the others defeated Lü Bu and occupied Chang'an, Jia Xu served under the central government led by them. During this time, he ensured the safety of the figurehead Han emperor, Emperor Xian, who was being held hostage by Li Jue. He also attempted to prevent internal conflict between Li Jue and Guo Si, but with limited success. After Emperor Xian escaped from Chang'an, Jia Xu left Li Jue and briefly joined the general Duan Wei before becoming a strategist of the warlord Zhang Xiu. While serving under Zhang Xiu, he advised his lord on how to counter invasions by the warlord Cao Cao, who had received Emperor Xian in 196 and taken control of the central government. In 200, during the Battle of Guandu between Cao Cao and his rival Yuan Shao, Jia Xu urged Zhang Xiu to reject Yuan Shao's offer to form an alliance and instead surrender to Cao Cao. Zhang Xiu heeded his advice. Jia Xu then became one of Cao Cao's strategists.\n\nDuring his service under Cao Cao, Jia Xu made three important contributions. First, during the Battle of Guandu, he urged Cao Cao to switch from being on the defensive to adopting an offensive stance, which ultimately led to Cao Cao's decisive victory over Yuan Shao. Second, during the Battle of Tong Pass in 211, he suggested to Cao Cao to pretend to agree to make peace with the northwestern warlords Han Sui and Ma Chao, and then sow discord between them. Cao Cao heeded his suggestion, successfully stirred up internal conflict among the warlords, and then used the opportunity to defeat them. Thirdly, in the 210s, when Cao Cao's sons Cao Pi and Cao Zhi were fighting to be their father's successor, Jia Xu indirectly helped Cao Pi by giving him advice and hinting to Cao Cao that he should choose the older son to be his heir apparent. After Cao Cao's death in 220, Cao Pi ended the Eastern Han dynasty by forcing Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him, and founded the state of Cao Wei with himself as the emperor. As an expression of gratitude to Jia Xu, Cao Pi appointed him as Grand Commandant – one of the top three positions in the Wei government – and promoted him to a district marquis. Between 220 and 223, Jia Xu advised Cao Pi against attacking Cao Wei's rival states, Eastern Wu and Shu Han, and focus on internal development. However, Cao Pi ignored his advice and invaded Wu, but ended up sustaining heavy losses and not making any significant gains. Jia Xu died in 223.\n\nJia Xu was from Guzang County (姑臧縣), Wuwei Commandery (武威郡), which is in present-day Wuwei, Gansu. In his youth, he was unimpressive and unheard of. However, Yan Zhong (閻忠), an official from Hanyang Commandery (漢陽郡; around present-day Gangu County, Gansu), felt that Jia Xu was extraordinary and even remarked that Jia had the brilliance of Zhang Liang and Chen Ping, two famous strategists of the early Western Han dynasty.\n\nJia Xu was nominated as a \"xiaolian\" to serve in the Eastern Han government as a Gentleman Cadet (郎). However, due to illness, he quit his job and went home. On the way back, he was captured by Di rebels at Qian County (汧縣; in present-day Long County, Shaanxi) along with several other travellers. He told the rebels: \"I am a maternal grandson of Lord Duan. If you let me live, my family will reward you handsomely.\" \"Lord Duan\" referred to Duan Jiong (段熲), who held the position of Grand Commandant (太尉) in the Han imperial court. As Duan Jiong had served for years as a general guarding the Han Empire's western regions, he was well known among the people living in the area. Jia Xu knew that the Di rebels were afraid of Duan Jiong, so he pretended to be Duan Jiong's maternal grandson. As he expected, the rebels treated him respectfully and released him. The other travellers were all killed.\n\nIn 189, the warlord Dong Zhuo entered the imperial capital, Luoyang, and took control of the central government. Jia Xu was then serving as the Commandant (都尉) of Pingjin (平津) and an assistant official in the Grand Commandant's office. He was promoted to Colonel Who Attacks Barbarians (討虜校尉) and assigned to the unit led by Dong Zhuo's son-in-law, Niu Fu.\n\nIn 192, Dong Zhuo was assassinated by Lü Bu in the imperial capital, Chang'an, while Niu Fu was murdered by his subordinates. The rest of Dong Zhuo's loyalists, including Li Jue, Guo Si and Zhang Ji, became fearful and wanted to disband and return to their respective home commanderies. Jia Xu told them: \"I heard that the new government in Chang'an is planning to exterminate everyone from Liang Province. If all of you break up and travel alone, even a \"tingzhang\" can arrest you. Why don't you retreat to the west together? There you can gather and reorganise your forces, and then attack Chang'an to avenge Lord Dong. If you succeed, you can make use of imperial authority to conquer the rest of the Empire. If you fail, it's still not too late to escape.\" Dong Zhuo's loyalists agreed with Jia Xu and did as he suggested. They managed to defeat the new central government in Chang'an led by Lü Bu and Wang Yun, and then took control of the city.\n\nPei Songzhi, who annotated Jia Xu's biography in the \"Sanguozhi\", strongly criticised Jia Xu for offering this suggestion. He argued that Dong Zhuo's death marked the end of his tyranny and a possible revival of the declining Eastern Han dynasty. However, due to Jia Xu's suggestion, the Han Empire became even more chaotic after Dong Zhuo's death.\n\nWhen Jia Xu later served as Left Adjunct (左馮翊), Li Jue and Dong Zhuo's loyalists wanted to reward him by making him a marquis, but Jia Xu said, \"That suggestion I made was meant to save your lives. What merit have I achieved to deserve a reward?\" He declined to accept the marquis title. Later on, when he was nominated to serve as a Supervisor of the Masters of Writing (尚書僕射), he said: \"The Supervisor of the Masters of Writing is like a tutor to officials. I don't have a strong reputation so I am afraid I might not be able to convince people that I am suited for this appointment. What will become of the imperial court if I accept this appointment for my personal glory?\" He was then assigned to be a Master of Writing (尚書) instead, and was tasked with selecting candidates to serve in the government. Li Jue and the others regarded him highly but were also wary of him. The candidates Jia Xu chose tend to be officials who formerly served in the previous administration. Jia Xu came under some criticisms for his mode of selecting government officials. When there were tensions between Li Jue, Guo Si and Fan Chou, with their respective subordinates urging them to go to war, Jia Xu reprimanded them for their behaviour and tried to persuade them to avoid conflict. They listened to him.\n\nWhen his mother died, Jia Xu resigned and went home for filial mourning. He was given the honorary position of a Household Counsellor (光祿大夫) by the imperial court. In 195, when conflict broke out between Li Jue and Guo Si in Chang'an, Li invited Jia Xu back to serve as General Who Upholds Righteousness (宣義將軍). Li Jue and his men discussed with Jia Xu their plan to bring Emperor Xian to their camp and use the emperor as a hostage to threaten Guo Si, but Jia Xu said: \"No, it isn't right to hold the Emperor hostage.\" Li Jue refused to listen to him and went ahead. Guo Si, on the other hand, kidnapped Emperor Xian's subjects and held them hostage in his own camp. Zhang Xiu told Jia Xu, \"You shouldn't stay here any longer. Why don't you leave?\" Jia Xu replied, \"I have received grace from the Empire, so I won't betray the Empire's trust in me. If you wish to leave, you can go. I won't leave.\"\n\nLi Jue used material wealth to tempt thousands of Qiang tribesmen to support him in his struggle against Guo Si. He even promised to give palace women as concubines to the tribal chiefs. When the tribesmen showed up at Chang'an, they asked: \"Is the Emperor inside? General Li has promised to give us palace women as concubines. Where are they?\" Emperor Xian turned to Jia Xu for help. Jia Xu secretly hosted a banquet for the tribal chiefs, gave them some expensive material gifts, and succeeded in making them leave. Li Jue lost the support of the tribal chiefs. Jia Xu played an important role in resolving the conflict between Li Jue and Guo Si, and in ensuring Emperor Xian's safety during the time. Later, after Emperor Xian escaped from Chang'an, Li Jue led his forces in pursuit and defeated forces led by the emperor's loyalists. He hated certain officials such as Zhao Wen (趙溫), Wang Wei (王偉), Zhou Zhong (周忠) and Rong Shao (榮邵), and wanted to execute them. Jia Xu advised him against it by saying: \"They are the Emperor's subjects. How can you harm them?\" Li Jue spared them.\n\nAfter Emperor Xian left Chang'an, Jia Xu gave up his official post and left Li Jue. He heard that the general Duan Wei (段煨), who was from the same commandery as him, was stationed at Huayin County (華陰縣; present-day Huayin, Shaanxi), so he went to Huayin County to join Duan Wei. Jia Xu was well known among Duan Wei's men, so Duan Wei was fearful that Jia Xu would seize the position of leadership from him. He pretended to treat Jia Xu respectfully while secretly keeping a close watch on him. Jia Xu knew that Duan Wei was suspicious of him, and he felt very uneasy.\n\nAround 196, the warlord Zhang Xiu was based in Nanyang Commandery (南陽郡; around present-day Nanyang, Henan). Jia Xu secretly contacted Zhang Xiu and conveyed his intention to join him; Zhang Xiu agreed and sent his men to receive Jia Xu. Before Jia Xu left Duan Wei, someone asked him, \"(Duan) Wei treated you generously. Why are you leaving?\" Jia Xu replied, \"(Duan) Wei is suspicious by nature and he's wary of me. Even though he treats me generously now, I believe he will harm me eventually. However, if I leave now, he will be more than happy to see me gone. If I manage to help him find an external ally, he will treat my family well. (Zhang) Xiu lacks a strategist, so he definitely hopes to have me on his side. By leaving, I can protect myself and my family.\"\n\nJia Xu left Duan Wei and headed to Nanyang Commandery, where Zhang Xiu welcomed him and treated him like a family elder. As Jia Xu foresaw, Duan Wei was pleased to see that Jia Xu had not only left, but also helped him gain Zhang Xiu as an ally. Jia Xu urged Zhang Xiu to form an alliance with Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province, and went to speak to Liu Biao. Liu Biao treated him like an honoured guest. Jia Xu remarked: \"(Liu) Biao has the ability to serve as a Ducal Minister in times of peace. However, he not only lacks foresight, but is also suspicious and indecisive, hence he won't be successful.\"\n\nIn 198, the warlord Cao Cao attacked Zhang Xiu again despite having suffered an earlier defeat at the Battle of Wancheng in 197. However, he pulled back his forces after learning that Tian Feng, an adviser to his rival, Yuan Shao, had urged Yuan Shao to attack Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) while he was away at war with Zhang Xiu. Zhang Xiu wanted to seize the opportunity to launch a counterattack, but Jia Xu warned him not to and predicted that he would be lose the battle. Zhang Xiu ignored him and led his troops to pursue Cao Cao's retreating forces. The result was just like what Jia Xu predicted. When Zhang Xiu came back after his defeat, Jia Xu told him to attack again and predicted that he would win this time. Zhang Xiu said: \"I didn't listen to you earlier, which resulted in my defeat. Now that I have lost, why should I attack again?\" Jia Xu replied: \"Changes have taken place. You'll win if you swiftly attack now.\" Zhang Xiu heeded Jia Xu's advice and attacked Cao Cao again. He won the battle this time.\n\nZhang Xiu asked Jia Xu: \"When I led my best troops to attack Cao Cao while he was retreating, you predicted I would lose. When I led my troops to attack Cao Cao again just after he defeated me, you predicted I would win. Your predictions turned out to be accurate. But why is it that your predictions seem so counter-intuitive?\" Jia Xu replied: \"It's easy to understand. General, you may be skilled in warfare, but you are still no match for Cao Cao. When Cao Cao withdrew his forces, I knew he would personally lead his rearguard to cover his retreat. Even though your troops are well-trained, Cao Cao is better than you as a military leader, and his troops are as equally well-trained as yours. Therefore, I knew you would lose. When Cao Cao first attacked you and decided to retreat halfway even though he didn't make any mistakes, I believed something must have happened in his base. After he defeated your pursuing forces, he would lower his guard and hastily retreat. His officers will then take command of the rearguard. They may be brave, but they are no match for you. Therefore, I knew you would win them even though you are leading a group of soldiers who have just been defeated.\" Zhang Xiu was very impressed with Jia Xu's analysis.\n\nIn 199, when Cao Cao and Yuan Shao were about to clash at the Battle of Guandu, Yuan Shao sent a messenger to meet Zhang Xiu and propose an alliance between them against Cao Cao. Zhang Xiu wanted to agree, but Jia Xu, who was beside him, said to Yuan Shao's messenger: \"I say 'No, thank you.' to Yuan Benchu. He can't even accommodate his own brother. What makes him think he can accommodate talents from around the Empire?\" A shocked Zhang Xiu turned to Jia Xu and asked: \"Why do you have to say this? What will become of me now?\" Jia Xu replied: \"Why don't you submit to Cao Cao?\" Zhang Xiu asked: \"Yuan Shao is powerful while Cao Cao is weak. Besides, I am also Cao Cao's enemy. What will happen if I submit to him?\" Jia Xu replied: \"That's why it is better for you to submit to Cao Cao. He controls the Empire in the name of the Emperor. This is the first reason why you should submit to him. Yuan Shao is militarily more powerful. You have less troops than him, so even if you join him, he won't regard you highly. Cao Cao has less troops. If you join him, he'll be delighted. This is the second reason why you should submit to him. A man who aspires to become a great ruler will be more willing to put aside personal enmities and make his virtues known to people. This is the third reason why you should submit to Cao Cao. I hope you won't have any more doubts.\" Zhang Xiu heeded Jia Xu's advice and led his forces to surrender to and join Cao Cao.\n\nCao Cao was very pleased to see Jia Xu. He held Jia Xu's hand and said: \"You are the person who helps to make my trustworthiness known throughout the Empire.\" Jia Xu was appointed Bearer of the Mace (執金吾) and enfeoffed as a Marquis of a Chief Village (都亭侯). He was later promoted to the position of Governor (牧) of Ji Province. As Ji Province was still under Yuan Shao's control then, Jia Xu served as a military adviser to Cao Cao, who then held the appointment of Minister of Works (司空).\n\nDuring the Battle of Guandu, when his supplies were running out after a prolonged stalemate against Yuan Shao, Cao Cao sought advice from Jia Xu, who said: \"My lord, you're wiser than (Yuan) Shao, braver than (Yuan) Shao, better at managing people than (Yuan) Shao, and more decisive than (Yuan) Shao. You have these four strengths, but the reason why you are unable to defeat him after six months is because you have been focusing too much on defence. You should be decisive when the opportunity arises, and victory will follow soon.\" Cao Cao replied, \"Fine.\" He then led his forces to attack Yuan Shao's camps, which were spread out a distance of over 30 \"li\", and destroyed them. Cao Cao won a decisive victory over Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu and subsequently conquered the rest of Yuan's territories north of the Yellow River.\n\nWhen Cao Cao was appointed as the Governor of Ji Province after pacifying northern China, Jia Xu was reassigned to be a Palace Counsellor (太中大夫) instead. In 208, after Cao Cao had annexed Jing Province, he planned to press on and attack the territories in Jiangdong controlled by the warlord Sun Quan. Jia Xu advised him against it and said: \"My lord, you have defeated the Yuans and now you have taken Jing Province. Your name spreads throughout the Empire and your military is very strong. If you follow in the footsteps of the Chu state by attracting talents to serve in the government and by improving the lives of the people, you won't need to resort to force to subdue the Jiangdong territories. They will be submit to you on their own.\" Cao Cao ignored Jia Xu and proceeded to attack Jiangdong. He lost the decisive Battle of Red Cliffs against the allied forces of Sun Quan and Liu Bei later that year.\n\nPei Songzhi, who annotated Jia Xu's biography in the \"Sanguozhi\", argued that Jia Xu's advice to Cao Cao was inappropriate. He pointed out that Cao Cao's territories lacked the stability necessary for Cao Cao to do as Jia Xu advised – focus on economic development in Jing Province. Moreover, Cao Cao had to deal with the external threats posed by warlords such as Han Sui and Ma Chao in the northwest. Pei Songzhi noted that Jing Province was highly unstable and would not remain under Cao Cao's control for long, because of the polarising effects of the presences of Liu Bei and Sun Quan in the region. He pointed out that during the Battle of Jiangling in 208, Cao Cao's general Cao Ren still lost Jiangling Commandery to Sun Quan and Liu Bei's forces despite his best efforts at defending it. Pei Songzhi thus concluded that it was impossible for Cao Cao to focus on economic development in Jing Province, given how unstable the region was, therefore Jia Xu's advice was inappropriate. He argued that Cao Cao made a right choice to attack Jiangdong at the right time, when he had resources for naval warfare acquired from his recent annexation of Jing Province. He also mentioned that Cao Cao's defeat at the Battle of Red Cliffs was not due to miscalculation or poor planning, but because of uncontrollable factors such as the plague which affected his troops and the winds which fanned the fire that destroyed his naval fleet.\n\nIn 211, Cao Cao engaged a coalition of northwestern warlords led by Han Sui and Ma Chao at the Battle of Tong Pass. Ma Chao and others agreed to make peace with Cao Cao on two conditions. Firstly, Cao Cao had to give up the northwestern territories to them. Secondly, Cao Cao had to grant them official titles. Jia Xu suggested that Cao Cao pretend to agree to their terms, and then try to sow discord among them. Cao Cao heeded Jia Xu's advice. When internal conflict broke out between Han Sui and Ma Chao, Cao Cao took advantage of the situation to attack them and achieved victory.\n\nSometime between 211 and 217, a power struggle broke out between two of Cao Cao's sons over the succession to the \"King of Wei\" (魏王), the nominal vassal king title held by their father. One of them was Cao Pi, Cao Cao's oldest surviving son, who held the appointment of General of the Household for All Purposes (五官中郎將). The other was Cao Zhi, who held the title \"Marquis of Linzi\" (臨菑侯) and was famous for his literary talent. Each of them had a faction supporting him.\n\nCao Pi sent a messenger to meet Jia Xu and seek his advice on how to consolidate his position. Jia Xu replied: \"I hope you will behave in a virtuous and humble manner, perform your duties faithfully, and be a filial son. That is all.\" Cao Pi took Jia Xu's advice very seriously and did as he was told.\n\nCao Cao faced a dilemma on choosing between his two sons so he consulted Jia Xu, who refused to give an answer. Cao Cao asked him: \"Why don't you give an answer?\" Jia Xu replied: \"I am still thinking about something, so I can't give an answer yet.\" Cao Cao asked, \"What are you thinking of?\" Jia Xu replied, \"I am thinking of Yuan Benchu, Liu Jingsheng, and their sons.\" Cao Cao laughed, made up his mind, and designated Cao Pi as his heir apparent.\n\nJia Xu was aware that he had not served under Cao Cao for as long as many of his colleagues. He foresaw that he might incur the jealousy and suspicions of others, hence he maintained a very low profile and distanced himself from his colleagues outside of the workplace. He also ensured that his children did not marry people from influential families. He earned the respect and admiration of many strategists and advisers.\n\nIn 220, Cao Pi forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him, thus ending the Han dynasty. He then established the state of Wei with himself as its first emperor. After ascending the throne, Cao Pi appointed Jia Xu as Grand Commandant (太尉) and promoted him from a Marquis of a Chief Village to the Marquis of Weishou District (魏壽鄉侯), with a marquisate of 800 taxable households. Jia Xu's promotion was allegedly an expression of gratitude from Cao Pi, who wanted to thank him for helping him seize the succession years ago. Sun Quan laughed when he heard that Cao Pi had appointed Jia Xu as his Grand Commandant.\n\nSometime between 220 and 223, Cao Pi wanted to attack and conquer Wei's two rival states, Wu and Shu. He consulted Jia Xu on which of the two he should attack first.\n\nJia Xu replied: \"Before you can conquer others, you have to build up military power first. Before you can establish a power base, you have to promote civil culture. Your Majesty has received the Mandate of Heaven in a timely fashion and now rules over the Empire. If you can promote civil culture while waiting for an opportunity to strike, it won't be difficult for you to conquer your enemies. Wu and Shu may be small and insignificant states, but they are shielded by natural geographical barriers such as mountains and rivers. Liu Bei has talent and great ambition; Zhuge Liang excels in statecraft; Sun Quan understands trends and sees through deception; Lu Yi assesses military power very well. They control geographically advantageous locations, and have set up defences at strategic points and the rivers and lakes. It is not easy to plan an attack. According to military strategy, you should gain the upper hand first before actually fighting a battle. You should assess the enemy's strength, and then decide which generals to send into battle. This is to ensure that you don't miscalculate. From my observation, none of our officials are capable of rivalling (Liu) Bei and (Sun) Quan. Even though you may fight a war with the prestige of an Emperor, you can't win without making significant losses. In the past, Shun ordered his troops to brandish their weapons to scare the Youmiao into submission. As of now, I think it is better to focus on civil affairs first before military affairs.\"\n\nCao Pi refused to listen to Jia Xu. In 223, Wei sustained heavy losses at the Battle of Jiangling against Wu.\n\nJia Xu died on 11 August 223 at the age of 77 (by East Asian age reckoning). He was given the posthumous title \"Marquis Su\" (肅侯).\n\nAccording to the \"Xin Tang Shu\", Jia Xu descended from the royal family of the Zhou dynasty. His ancestor was Gongming (公明), the youngest son of Shuyu (a son of King Wu of Zhou). Gongming was enfeoffed by King Kang of Zhou as the Count of Jia (賈伯) and given the lands around Linfen as his fief, which was named \"Jia\". His descendants adopted \"Jia\" as their family name. Jia Yi, a notable scholar-politician who lived in the Western Han dynasty, was an ancestor of Jia Xu. Jia Xu's father, Jia Gong (賈龔), served as a General of Light Cavalry (輕騎將軍) in the Eastern Han dynasty and moved his residence to Wuwei Commandery, where Jia Xu was born. Jia Xu had an elder brother, Jia Cai (賈綵).\n\nJia Xu had at least three sons. His eldest son, Jia Mu (賈穆), was a Chief Commandant of Escorting Cavalry (駙馬都尉). After Jia Xu's death, Jia Mu inherited his father's marquis title, Marquis of Weishou District (魏壽鄉侯). He also served as the Administrator (太守) of various commanderies. Jia Xu's youngest son, Jia Fang (賈訪), was given a marquis title and 200 taxable households around the same time as when Jia Xu was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Weishou District. According to the \"Xin Tang Shu\", Jia Xu had a son, Jia Ji (賈璣), who also served as a Chief Commandant of Escorting Cavalry like Jia Mu, and held the title of a Secondary Marquis (關內侯). Jia Ji is not mentioned in Jia Xu's official biography in the \"Sanguozhi\".\n\nWhen Jia Mu died, his marquis title was passed on to his son, Jia Mo (賈模). According to the \"Shiyu\" (世語), Jia Mo served as a Regular Mounted Attendant (散騎常侍) and General Who Protects the Army (護軍將軍) during the reign of Emperor Hui in the Western Jin dynasty. Jia Mo had two sons, Jia Yin (賈胤) and Jia Kan (賈龕). Jia Yin, Jia Kan, and their cousin Jia Pi (賈疋), served in the Jin government and held high official positions.\n\nJia Xu annotated the military treatise \"Wuzi\" and wrote another military text called \"Wu Sun Zi Sanshi'er Lei Jing\" (吳孫子三十二壘經). He also created a copy of Sun Tzu's \"The Art of War\".\n\nChen Shou, who wrote Jia Xu's biography in the \"Sanguozhi\", appraised him as follows: \"Xun You and Jia Xu were very detailed in their strategising and had never miscalculated before. However, in terms of adaptability and flexibility, they were second to (Zhang) Liang and (Chen) Ping.\"\n\nPei Songzhi, who annotated the \"Sanguozhi\", disagreed with Chen Shou. He believed that biographies should be categorised in the same volume on the basis of similarities. He argued that Jia Xu's biography should be in the same volume as the biographies of Cheng Yu and Guo Jia rather than in the same volume as the biographies of Xun Yu and Xun You. In Pei Songzhi's opinion, Jia Xu was more similar to the former two than to the latter two. Pei Songzhi even remarked, \"The difference between the moral characters of Xun You and Jia Xu is like the difference between moonlight and candlelight. Both give off light, but they are fundamentally different.\" He also criticised Chen Shou for appraising Xun You and Jia Xu in the same sentence instead of appraising them separately.\n\nJia Xu was first introduced as a playable character in the seventh instalment of Koei's \"Dynasty Warriors\" video game series.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is part of the Delta Park complex on the former site of Vanport, just south of the Columbia River. It lies west of a light rail station and less than a mile west of Interstate 5.\n\nThe track hosts the IndyCar Series, ICSCC and SCCA and OMRRA road racing, the NASCAR K&N Pro Series West, and SCCA autocross events. Additionally, the PIR grounds are host to OBRA (Oregon Bicycle Racing Association) bicycling races on the track and the surrounding grounds. The facility includes a dragstrip and a motocross track.\nThe road course is almost perfectly flat and runs clockwise. Two track configurations are possible. One includes a hard chicane at the end of the front straight and involves 12 turns at length of 1.945 miles (3.13 km). Without the chicane, the track has nine turns and a lap length of 1.915 miles (3.08 km). Portland is classified as an FIA Grade Two circuit.\n\nThe City of Portland is working to establish the track as carbon neutral.\n\nPIR is built on the former location of Vanport, Oregon, which was destroyed on Memorial Day, May 30, 1948, when a railroad berm broke and water from the Columbia River flooded the city. After the flood, all that remained were the paved streets and concrete foundations of destroyed buildings.\n\nThe first races took place on these old city streets in 1961 during the Portland Rose Festival. Since then, the Rose Cup has become an annual event. Racing at \"West Delta Park\", as PIR was known back then, was quite dangerous. Racers leaving the track unexpectedly could collide with leftover concrete foundations or fall into ponds.\n\nUnder the threat of losing the Rose Cup races, since many of the sanctioning racing bodies would no longer sanction races due to the deteriorating roads and dangerous obstacles, the track was finally paved in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1975, Portland International hosted the Trans-Am Series, the premier series of the Sports Car Club of America, which was won by John Greenwood, driving a Chevrolet Corvette. Greenwood would go on to win the 1975 Trans-Am Series Championship.\n\nBeginning in 1984, Portland International began hosting the cars and stars of the Champ Car World Series, with Al Unser Jr. taking first win, driving a Cosworth powered March. \n\nIn 1999 and 2000, the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series ran a race at Portland International Raceway. The race was added after the demise of the ½-mile Portland Speedway that hosted races early in the series.\n\nAt the end of 2007 and the beginning of 2008, PIR went through a track renovation. The track was repaved with new asphalt and some minor changes were made to the track layout. Turns 4-7 were widened. The fence on the inside of turn 6 was moved to provide a better sightline through the corner. Turn 7 was sharpened to slow down racers prior to entering the back straight. Formula One-style curbs were also installed on the track. The track reopened on February 23, 2008, with a ribbon cutting ceremony.\n\nIn September 2018, the Grand Prix of Portland returned after an 11-year hiatus.\n\n\n"}

The area is currently in a military zone and is closed to visitors. This verse differs considerably from the description of the same event in . In Luke's account, Jesus is one of the crowd that has come to see John and it does not specify who baptized Jesus. Nor does the version at provide many details.

{"id": "1961759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1961759", "title": "Edna Mode", "text": "Edna Mode\n\nEdna \"E\" Mode is a fictional character in Pixar's animated superhero film \"The Incredibles\" (2004) and its sequel \"Incredibles 2\" (2018). She is an eccentric fashion designer renowned for designing the costumes of several famous superheroes, having worked particularly closely with Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl (Bob and Helen Parr), with whom she has maintained a strong friendship. When the couple resumes their superheroic careers after fifteen years, Edna is summoned out of retirement to aid both characters, first by equipping Mr. Incredible with a new costume and then by restoring Elastigirl's confidence in herself as a superheroine.\n\nEdna was created by screenwriter and director Brad Bird to explain how \"The Incredibles\"' superheroes obtain their costumes, a topic he believes is rarely explored in superhero films convincingly. Bird also decided to voice the character himself after several actresses originally considered for the role failed to replicate Edna's unique accent. The director understood that, in addition to fashion expertise, the character would also need to demonstrate proficiency in science, engineering and technology in order to create costumes capable of withstanding the trials of superheroic activities, and ultimately conceived her as a short, confident character of both German and Japanese descent based on these countries' reputations as small yet powerful nations. Inspired by Q from the \"James Bond\" franchise, Edna is widely believed to have been based primarily on costume designer Edith Head, although there continues to be constant speculation as to which celebrities inspired Edna, particularly \"Vogue\" editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and actress Linda Hunt.\n\nDespite having only supporting roles in both films, Edna has since established herself as \"The Incredibles\" breakout character due to her popularity among fans. While film critics agree that Edna is a scene-stealer, particularly praising her humor and dialogue, Bird has also been lauded for his voice acting, earning an Annie Award for Voice Acting in a Feature Production for his performance as the character. Edna has been recognized as one of Pixar's greatest characters by several prominent media publications.\n\nEdna was created for \"The Incredibles\" by writer and director Brad Bird. Having watched several superhero-themed films and television shows prior to developing \"The Incredibles\", Bird had often found himself wondering who is responsible for making the superheroes' elaborate costumes. Bird conceived Edna upon discovering that, despite featuring characters dressed in fancy, extravagant costumes, traditional superhero films rarely offer plausible explanations as to how superheroes come to obtain these outfits, or who provides them in the first place. The director wanted to debunk the trope of muscular superheroes sewing their own costumes, finding it hard to believe that superheroes would suddenly develop a strong enough interest in fashion and textiles to design their own outfits. Therefore, Bird decided that if the world was populated with superheroes, there would naturally also be people responsible for designing their costumes who must also have a background in science and engineering, thereby envisioning Edna as a scientist and technical genius in addition to being a fashion designer. The director elaborated, \"The way I saw it, the costumes had to be created by somebody with a scientific and engineering background\", thus conceiving Edna as \"a half-German, half-Japanese, tiny powerhouse of a character\". \"The Incredibles\" was the first Pixar film to earn a PG rating; Edna is considered to be one of the studio's earliest attempts at approaching \"darker, edgier comedy,\" which is particularly demonstrated by the scene in which the character cites several graphic examples of capes directly resulting in the deaths of several superheroes, one of whom is shown being consumed and killed by a jet turbine. According to Bird, the creation of Edna took the notion of superheroes wearing designed costumes \"to a further extreme\".\n\nEdna was named after EMode, a software Pixar used at the time the film was made. Bird identified Edna as the \"most fun character\" he had written for the film, recalling, \"Any day that I was writing her, I was one happy camper.\" Edna follows the tradition of having a director voice one of the film's secondary characters in animated films, which was based around Bird's \"slave-driver voice\" that he used during production. Bird's voice for the character originated during the story boarding process, during which various Pixar employees typically provide characters' voices temporarily while the filmmakers and animators organize the film's pacing and staging in order to \"get a sense of the film.\" Although these voices are usually eventually replaced by professional actors and voice actors, there are some situations in which \"those voices stick\", as was the case with the voice Bird had created for Edna. Bird had also provided the temporary voices of other characters during this time, including Bob Parr and Syndrome. Several actresses had been considered for the role; one actress, whom Bird is particularly fond of, constantly asked Bird to repeatedly demonstrate his interpretation of one of Edna's lines until telling him that he should simply voice the character himself since he \"kind of got a beat on it\". The role was also offered to actress and comedian Lily Tomlin, who was sent a tape recording of Bird recording Edna's part in its entirety; Tomlin declined upon hearing Bird's interpretation, feeling she could not voice the character as funnily as he did. Bird's colleagues had to heavily convince him to voice the character himself. Finally succumbing to \"popular demand\" from his fellow Pixar employees, Bird joked that he was ultimately cast as Edna simply because he was both affordable and available at the time. A similar tactic was used for several other supporting characters in the film: animator Bret Parker voices Kari, the Parr family's babysitter, writer Bud Luckey voices government agent Rick Dicker, and production designer Lou Romano voices Bernie Kropp, Dash's teacher.\n\nBird described Edna's voice as a combination of a Japanese and German accent, deciding to draw influence from these countries because \"they're two small countries that have amazing design and amazing technology\", citing cameras and cars as examples of technology in which they specialize. Urban Cinefile's Louise Keller described the character's voice as \"mid European ... complicated by an Asian touch\". Although Bird's performance is considerably broad, he avoids allowing Edna to become too much of a caricature in order to maintain the illusion that she is one of the film's smartest characters. In the Italian and French-language versions of the film, Bird's comic accent is replaced by that of French-Italian entertainer Amanda Lear, who offers a more seductive, \"biting\" interpretation. Lear said that dubbing Edna's voice was not an easy process, but accepted the job after being offered the role upon seeing the film at the Cannes Film Festival in order to fulfill her dream of having always wanted to voice a Disney character. Edna was the first character Lear was hired to dub in Italian.\n\nBird believes that he shares some of Edna's personality traits, specifically the way in which he prefers to be involved in virtually every creative aspect of his projects, including story boarding, writing and cinematography, admitting that he and his character demonstrate both a high level of self-confidence and lack of self-doubt when it comes to their own work. Bird elaborated that \"At my most confident, I feel like her \n... She is absolutely convinced that her way is the right way, and if you disagree … you’re just wrong!” Bird identified Edna as one of the film's most difficult characters to design. The character went through several different changes in appearance during the development process, ranging from taller and overweight to older, younger and thinner. Inspired by the large impact that countries such as Japan and Germany have on the world despite being comparatively small in size, Bird decided that Edna would demonstrate this theme by being \"a tiny character that dominates the room when she gets into it.\" Her home, which uses high-end technology similar to what she incorporates into the outfits she creates, was deliberately designed to be significantly larger than she is to further emphasize this theme of dominance. Edna's small stature was also inspired by singer Bette Midler, of whom Bird has always been a fan. The director recalled being surprised by Midler's height when he first met her \"Because ... she absolutely dominates the screen. And it just struck me how much personality was in this small body.\" In terms of animation, Bird wanted all of the film's characters to move differently from each other, providing Edna with a very confident walk to represent the fact that she has \"never experienced doubt in her life.\" The animators found the fact that Bird provided the character's voice himself to be very helpful as he would often act out the way in which the character acts and behaves himself, which helped in further defining the animator's vision of Edna. According to Bird, Edna, despite her petite stature, is the only non-superhero in \"The Incredibles\" capable of making superheroes feel uncomfortable. Bird described Edna as a character who is \"not remotely intimidated by superheroes or anyone\", refusing to accept the word \"no\" when it is used in opposition of her opinions or beliefs. \n\nDescribing Edna's physical attributes as \"severe\", Bird had envisioned the character having glasses and a pageboy haircut, while still wanting her to appear modern and elegant at the same time. Edna's ethnicity has been identified as half-German and half-Japanese. Both Edna's physical appearance and voice are widely believed to have based on those of costume designer Edith Head, with whom she shares her signature round glasses and black bob cut. According to Head's entry in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the character is inspired by both the costume designer's signature glasses and \"forthright personality\". Bird described Edna as a combination of both Head and Q, a character featured in the \"James Bond\" franchise. The director has generally declined to confirm any direct influences on the character, insisting that Edna is \"not based on a specific person\", including publicly refuting claims that he based the character on Head, although she continues to be considered the character's \"most legitimate\" alleged inspiration. However, animator Teddy Newton, who co-designed Edna with Bird, revealed that he and Pixar were inspired by the film \"Unzipped\" (1995), a documentary depicting the petulance of fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi and stylist Polly Allen Mellen. Fans have long speculated about the real-life inspiration behind Edna's design and appearance. Bird stated he has constantly been told by various fans and viewers that the character reminds them of at least 15 different celebrities since the character debuted in \"The Incredibles\". Contributing to \"Fashion\", Erin Dunlop described the character as \"a supercharged hybrid of every fashion industry legend we can think of\". In an article discussing who Edna is based on, \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s Steve Daly cited \"Vogue\" editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, designer Coco Chanel and actress Lotte Lenya as possible influences, while drawing similarities between the character's use of large-framed glasses to architect Philip Johnson, producer Robert Evans, talent agent Swifty Lazar, studio executive Lew Wasserman, and fashion editor Carrie Donovan. Some critics have suspected that the character is also based on Mary Quant and Una Jones. Acknowledging that there are several female fashion designers who wear glasses upon whom Edna could have been based, Bird admitted that the character was inspired by author Patricia Highsmith and actress Linda Hunt, elaborating: \"When you're designing a character, you're just saying - who is that? ... We tried a lot of stuff and we kept saying no, no, more like this, but I like the nose on this one, and maybe the pageboy cut, maybe glasses should be bigger ... and you end up with something that reminds you of Edith Head and Linda Hunt.\"\n\nFor the sequel, shading art director Bryn Imagire decided to incorporate more of Edna's Japanese heritage into her two new costumes, basing them on the work of Japanese costume designers Rei Kawakubo, Eiko Ishioka and Chitose Abe. Imagire was particularly inspired by Kawakubo's quote, \"For something to be beautiful, it doesn’t have to be pretty,” and opting to envision Edna's outfits \"more as abstract sculpture\" as opposed to forms of clothing. In order to design costumes for a fictional character who also happens to be a designer in her own film, Imagire drew upon lessons she had learned while attending art school, describing Edna's style as \"very to the point and very specific\" while imagining what the character might be thinking while designing her clothes. Meanwhile, character artist Deanna Marsigliese's first assignment was to create an entire line of clothing designed by Edna, for which she was tasked with \"thinking like Edna\". Although ultimately the completed clothing line does not appear in the final film, Marsigliese considered the experience to be \" a study in (Edna's) character\" nonetheless, during which she drew inspiration from Edna's appearance and wardrobe in the first film, from her dress to the interior of her house. Although she was aware that Edna enjoys being dramatic, she acknowledge that \"fashion designers don’t necessarily design things that they would wear on their person, they design for their models\", meaning, \"Their aesthetic is oftentimes different.” Similarly, Imagire agreed that fashion designers such as Kawakubo, Ishioka and Abe \"always looked really comfortable in contrast to what they were creating for their models\", a contrast that she wanted to incorporate into the character. Recalling that Edna dislikes models, the artist envisioned that the character would instead design her own clothing to serve as \"a vehicle to celebrate superheroes and her powers.\" Inspired by Italian fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli, Marsigliese created a \"classic, mid-century inspired silhouette\" for Edna's costumes that were also bold and dramatic as though Edna herself had designed them, then rearranging the designs to ultimately give them a more surreal, specific appearance. Dubbing the character a \"woman of the now\", Marsigliese explained that, like Schiaparelli, Edna is \"completely ahead of her time\" despite living in the 1950s; \"she used a lot of surrealist elements, a lot of fun surprises, and that was very inspiring for me.” Imagire designed approximately 25 potential costumes for Edna, 15 of which she showed to Bird before the final two were decided upon: a simple indigo dress and black-and-red kimono.\n\nAccording to Matthew Brunson of Creative Loafing, Edna provides the majority of the film's comic relief. Hischak believes that Edna offers \"a whole new viewpoint to the world of superheroes\", in addition to demonstrating the film's \"oddball silliness\". \"Vogue Italia\" published a biography of Edna, in which author Valentina Fabbri described her as a character who \"knows she’s the best and she doesn’t hide it, and her lack of modesty is equalled only by her intuition\", with whom it is virtually impossible to have a conversation because \"she tends to dominate.\" Due to her combination of genius-level intellect and \"craziness,\" Fabbri identified Edna as \"a fun, bubbly caricature of the magicians of fashion\" by \"embod[ying] their talent and charisma, their vices and virtues.\" Screen Rant's Victoria Robertson observed that the character \"has a lot of personality packed into a small exterior, taking stereotypical traits often attributed to designers and making them her own\", firstly remaining proud of her own work at all times. Oliver Lyttelton of IndieWire identified Edna as quite possibly the film's most intelligent character. Edna's criticisms of fashion can come off as unpleasant at times, but are exaggerated to the point of which audiences find them to be comical. Edna prefers to always think about the future, finding dwelling on the past to be distracting from the present, as demonstrated by her line \"I never look back, dahling, it distracts from the now\", and thus has proven capable of determining the needs of her superhero clientele before they have the opportunity to finalize their ideas themselves. Her personality has been described by \"GamesRadar+\"'s Joshua Winning as \"brassy\" and \"no-nonsense\". Q13 Fox described Edna as \"a gifted designer, an assertive life coach and a witty talker,\" using her mind and intelligence as a means of solving everyday issues. BuddyTV believes that the character's \"bold and eccentric attitude\" is rivaled only by her considerable talent. According to Kevin Carr of Film School Rejects, Edna \"doesn’t take crap from anyone\" yet \"she does so with poise and pride.\" The \"San Francisco Chronicle\"'s Carla Meyer argues that Edna is \"more a caricature than a character.\"\nScott Tobias of \"Rolling Stone\" called Edna \"a reminder that the superhero suit needs to the perfect synthesis of form and function\", without which \"greatness as both a crimefighter and an icon is impossible.\" According to Thomas S. Hischak, author of \"100 Greatest American and British Animated Films\", Edna is just as concerned with the appearance of the costumes she designs as she is about their use and practicality, proving capable of designing outfits that can stretch, change their shape and resist oncoming attacks such as missiles and fires. The character proves capable of designing a costume for Violet that is capable of becoming invisible whenever its wearer does. She absolutely refuses to incorporate capes into her new designs due to the accessory having a history of contributing to the deaths of superheroes in the past, among them Dynaguy, Thunderhead, Stratogale, Meta-Man and Splashdown, presenting them as a \"montage of superhero couture faux-pas\". Ultimately, her knowledge of the dangers of capes results in the death of the film's villain Syndrome. In terms of her own appearance, Edna is costumed in \"futuristic black\" attire, wearing a black dress that boasts square lines. Estimating her height to be of approximately three feet, \"The Tyee\"'s Dorothy Woodend wrote that Edna is dressed in Issey Miyake pleats while being of \"indeterminate gender\". VPRO drew similarities between the character's hairstyle and personality to that of \"Vogue\" editor Anna Wintour, the resemblance to whom Tech Times' Katherine Derla identified as \"The first thing viewers are likely to remember upon seeing\" the character. According to \"STATUS\" magazine, Edna is often mistaken for the magazine editor largely due to her \"snappy sass and iconic bob\". Film's Angie Han joked that Edna's \"no-nonsense demeanor\" would leave Wintour \"quaking in her Chanel boots.\" When asked about the alleged similarities between her and the character, Wintour revealed that she has yet to see the film. Derla also wrote that Edna is capable of \"run[ing] the world\" but opts to operate from behind the scenes instead. The term \"diminutive\" is often used to describe the character's height.\n\nConsidering herself to be \"too talented\" to design clothes for normal humans, Edna resents having been forced to resort to designing clothes for supermodels during the 15-year-long absence of superheroes, dismissing them as \"Spoiled, stupid little stick figures with poofy lips who think only about themselves\", an opinion she formed after being forced to work with such individuals in Milan and Paris. Edna believes that designing clothes for superheroes is similar to designing for gods, and thus considers herself to be far superior to other fashion designers. Despite her considerable success as one of the world's top fashion designers internationally, Edna longs to return to working with superheroes so that she can challenge her designs by \"fus[ing] the latest technology with her impeccable fashion sense\" to the public's amusement, who continue to adore both her and her creations, insisting that there is nothing \"super\" about supermodels. Despite designing elaborate costumes for a living, Edna prefers a more simple aesthetic for herself, generally avoiding nail polish and accessories. Racked's Carlye Wisel observed that although the sequel \"may have deep roots in midcentury-modern design ... Edna remains true to her forward-looking style, wearing a red silk kimono as well as an asymmetrical sheath that feels like yet another nod to Kawakubo’s work.\" In addition to being a talented fashion designer, Edna has also demonstrated proficiency in psychology. In addition to designing their clothes, she offers advice to her clients whenever she feels that they require it, demonstrating a \"zero-tolerance policy for emotional weakness\" which, according to \"The Dissolve\"'s Charles Bramesco, represents Bird's \"lament[ing] regular folks’ tendency to impede awesome people from being awesome.\" Edna is known for her tendency to refer to her cohorts as \"dahling\", while her colleagues affectionately refer to her as \"E\". In addition to citing her resemblance to Wintour, journalist Hadley Freeman of \"The Guardian\" believes that Edna's use of fashion in the film represents \"The highest pinnacle of human achievement. Without them the world would come to an end.\"\n\nEdna first appears in \"The Incredibles\" as a fashion designer to superheroes and close friend of the titular characters. During the “golden age of superheroes\", Edna is one of a few elite guests who attend the private wedding ceremony of Bob and Helen Parr, then better-known to the public as the superheroes Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl. After all superheroes have been outlawed and forced to retire following a series of lawsuits, forcing Edna to retire from superhero work due to government restrictions, Edna does not appear again until approximately midway through film when she is unexpectedly visited by Bob who has resumed superhero work undercover, a secret he keeps from his family. Bob initially asks Edna to simply repair his original super suit, but she ultimately convinces him to allow her to design an entirely new outfit on the condition that capes not be incorporated whatsoever due to safety concerns, ultimately ending her 15 years-long retirement from superhero work. Helen soon discovers that Bob's original super suit had received a patch job, determining that the only person capable of repairing a super suit would be Edna and growing more suspicious of Bob's actions. Later in the film, Helen visits Edna in the hopes of finding out more information about Bob's whereabouts, discovering that she had taken the liberty of designing a complete matching set of super suits for his family. Although their reunion is brief, Edna provides an initially distraught Helen with the encouragement she needs to resume her identity as Elastigirl in order to save her husband (and their marriage), in addition to introducing the character to the homing device she had implanted in her husband's suit, intentionally revealing his exact location to her.\n\nEdna appears in the film's sequel, \"Incredibles 2\" (2018). When Helen is recruited by a pair of entrepreneurs to change the public's perception of superheroes and thus returns to work to fight crime as Elastigirl, Edna is upset to learn that Elastigirl's costume has been designed by a rival designer. Bob soon becomes overwhelmed by Jack-Jack's emerging superpowers, and recruits Edna for assistance with controlling him. Although Edna is initially reluctant to babysit Jack-Jack, she soon develops a strong liking for the baby and she is willing to babysit him overnight free of charge; during this time, she upgrades his suit with sensors and a remote control so that the family can monitor his powers and rein them in as needed. She gives the enhanced suit to Bob in a custom shopping bag, which bears a logo for her services that incorporates her signature eyeglasses into its lettering. Edna also appears in Disney on Ice's adaptation of the film: \"The Incredibles in a Magic Kingdom Adventure\". The time that Edna spends looking after Jack-Jack is the focus of the animated short \"Auntie Edna\".\n\nThe public was immediately captivated by Edna upon her debut, becoming particularly enamored with the character's combination of irreverence and sulkiness. Edna instantly established herself as a fan favorite when the film was released in 2004, which Racked's Carlye Wisel has attributed to the character's combination of wit and style. Several critics have referred to Edna as a scene-stealing character; \"Fashion\" magazine's Erin Dunlop crowned Edna \"the undisputed scene-stealer of\" the film. Dubbing her \"One of the great scene-stealing characters in \"The Incredibles\"\", HowStuffWorks contributor Vicki Arkoff called Edna \"deliciously deadpan\". Ken Hanke, writing for the \"Mountain Xpress\", considers Edna to be among the film's gags and characters who \"are delightful and very funny\", particularly highlighting the character's anti-cape monologue while deeming her \"worth the price of admission\". Film critic Peter Bradshaw, contributing to \"The Irish Times\", described Edna as \"a joy with her wonderful and appropriate maxim: 'I never look back, darling. It distracts from the now.'\" Dorothy Woodend, writing for \"The Tyee\", praised Edna as \"a more interesting creature than all the Incredibles put together.\" Describing her as \"a personage I'd like to see more of\", Woodend continued that the character \"steals the show, and does fabulous things with it, darling.\" Referred to as one of the film's \"high point[s]\", Kevin Lally of \"Film Journal International\" described the character's anti-cape montage as \"pricelessly funny\", a sentiment with which Matt Brunson of Creative Loafing agreed. The \"National Post\" described Edna as \"exactly the kind of person you want at your dinner party\". Notable Biographies identified Edna as \"one of the audience's favorite characters\".\n\nBird has also garnered critical acclaim for his performance. Nell Minow of Common Sense Media wrote that Bird \"plays the funniest character in the film\", while AllMovie's Perry Seibert described his performance as \"screamingly funny\". Pete Vonder Haar of \"Film Threat\" wrote that Bird contributes \"the best work\" to the film as Edna in terms of dialogue and vocal performance, calling her rant about the \"idiocy\" of capes \"priceless.\" Scott Chitwood, writing for ComingSoon.net, agreed that Bird is \" absolutely hilarious as Edna\". \"Empire\"'s Colin Kennedy dubbed Bird's voice work \"an unmistakable highlight\". BBC's Stella Papamichael agreed that the director \"steals the show\" as Edna. Carla Meyer, writing for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", wrote that Bird's performance as Edna \"shows his versatility\". In 2005, Bird won an Annie Award for Voice Acting in a Feature Production at the 32nd Annie Awards for his performance as Edna, in addition to being rewarded for writing and directing the film. Bird was rewarded over actor Samuel L. Jackson, who had been nominated in the same category for his role as Frozone. Wisel appreciated Edna's cameo in the sequel, describing it as \"perfect in its restraint.\"\n\nVulture.com ranked Bird's role as Edna the fourth greatest performance in an animated film, calling it \"a scene- and movie-stealing performance\". Similarly, \"Entertainment Weekly\" placed Edna fourth on their ranking of \"The 10 greatest Pixar voice performances\", with author Marc Snetiker calling it \"an all-too-short but memorably delicious appearance\" in which Bird \"left an indelible mark on his own universe\". Snetiker called the character \"overwhelmingly funny thanks to Bird’s unrestrained efforts on even the simplest lines.\" IndieWire ranked Bird's performance as Edna the 14th \"30 Best Voice Performances In Pixar Movies\". Kiko Martinez of the \"San Antonio Current\" found Bird's performance to be worthy of an Academy Award, ranking him among \"15 Actors Who Should’ve Won an Oscar for Their Voice Work\". Bird revealed that fans tend to be more impressed by the fact that he provides Edna's voice than his success as a director and writer, explaining, \"If I say a line in Edna’s voice, that’s far more delightful than the fact that I spent four years wrestling something into being.\"\n\nEdna's popularity among audiences established her as the film's breakout character. Screen Rant's Alex Welch attributes this designation to both her comedic rapport with the titular family and passion for superhero costumes. Gregory E. Miller of the \"New York Post\" cited Edna's impact since \"The Incredibles\" as significant despite her relatively brief appearance, while HelloGiggles writer Sydney Bucksbaum crowned her the film's \"real hero\". \"Vogue Italia\" contributor Valentina Fabbri wrote that Edna ended the trope of \"superheroes [dressed] in homemade outfits\". According to Fabbri, Edna is one of Pixar's most beloved characters, while Hollywood.com's Julia Emmanuele dubbed her \"one of the most memorable Pixar characters of all time\" who has ultimately \"become the film’s enduring legacy\", despite her supporting role. Uproxx contributor Donna Dickens wrote that the character \"went down in pop culture history\" from the moment she uttered \"No capes!”\n\nMedia publications consistently rank Edna among Pixar's greatest characters. In their article \"Top 10 Pixar Movie Characters\", \"Tech Times\" ranked Edna seventh. IGN ranked Edna eighth in their countdown of the \"Top 10 Pixar Characters\", calling her \"a pint-sized fashionista\" with \"a flair that only a superhero could truly appreciate.\" \"Rolling Stone\" placed her ninth on the website's list of the \"25 Best Pixar Movie Characters\", ranking her ahead of Mr. Incredible (24th), Violet Parr (20th) and Elastigirl (14th). Contributor Scott Tobias wrote that the character \"stops the action cold just to have a sequence about appropriate action-wear for the specially abled, culminating in a brilliant screed on the impracticality of capes.\" Including Edna among the studio's 20 best characters, Victoria Robertson of Screen Rant cited her as \"proof of how important even the most minor characters in a film can be.\" \"GamesRadar+\" included Edna among Pixar's \"50 Greatest Pixar Characters Of All Time\", with author George Wales crowning her \"One of Pixar's finest comic creations\". Additionally, the same publication ranked Edna among Pixar's 12 greatest supporting characters. D23.com recognized Edna as one of Pixar's \"23 Favorite ... Supporting Characters\", deeming her \"An icon in her own right\". /Film ranked Edna Pixar's sixth best female character, crowning her \"the wisest character in the entire Incredibles universe\" due to her anti-cape stance, which author Angie Han has described as the film's \"most valuable piece of advice\". The Odyssey Online published an article discussing \"Why Edna Mode Is The Disney Heroine We Never Knew We Needed\", in which author Erin Farmer dubbed her \"the real heroine of the Disney Franchise\" while comparing her motivational speeches to those of Mahatma Gandhi. \"GamesRadar+\" ranked Edna's introductory scene the 12th best moment in a Pixar film, deeming her \"the perfect embodiment of the film's tongue-in-cheek approach to realism\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked Edna's anti-capes speech the 12th best Pixar moment. In 2015, E! ranked Edna 10th on their list of \"11 Forgotten Disney Characters Who Should Totally Be Your Favorites\".\n\nIn 2015, \"Empire\" ranked the character the hundredth greatest film character of all-time. In 2013, Screen Rant crowned Edna \"The world’s greatest fashion designer\". \"Fashion\" ranked Edna among the magazine's \"10 coolest fashion industry pros\". In their \"critical assessment of 7 fictional fashion designers\", Mary Sollosi of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote that she is \"consistently impressed by Ms. Mode’s truly groundbreaking textile work\" despite feeling that she tends to limit herself to familiar silhouettes, joking, \"we are perplexed by her stubborn refusal to incorporate new design features — most notably capes.\" In June 2018, Carlye Wisel of Racked crowned Edna \"Film’s greatest fashion character\", deeming her \"the best fictional fashion personality ever to exist, animated or not\". She prefers her over \"The Devil Wears Prada\"'s Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), insisting that Edna \"feels more grounded and true\" than Miranda, a fictional magazine editor who is frequently touted the \"best-ever fashion character\". Describing her as \"effortless and memorable,\" Wisel concluded, \"at a time when a label like Gucci is exploding its brand with misspellings and magpie tendencies to draw attention, she remains classic. Edna is never anything but fully herself — all hair, accent, and attitude.\"\n\nEdna's catchphrase against using capes in superhero costumes has become one of the most popular phrases among superhero fans. Edna has become so popular that fans have begun to demand a spin-off film revolving around the character. Screen Rant ranked Edna the third Pixar heroine who deserves her own film, with author Wednesday Lee Friday writing, \"There are so many things Pixar could do with Edna, she might be worthy of a trilogy.\" At the 77th Academy Awards in 2005, Edna presented the Academy Award for Best Costume Design alongside actor Pierce Brosnan. In 2013, the D23 Expo hosted its first official cosplay competition, naming it \"Heroes and Villains à la Mode\" in honor of Edna; contestants competed in five categories, with the winners being awarded miniature statuettes of the character. To promote the film's sequel in which Edna appeared, Disney released a mockumentary-style teaser trailer that features various celebrities involved in the fashion industry paying tribute to Edna and describing ways in which the character has influenced them over the years ever since she decided to venture into haute couture. Disney revealed the trailer at the D23 Expo in 2017. Fashion models Heidi Klum, Kendall Jenner and Rachel Zoe are among the celebrities who speak about Edna's influence on the fashion industry. Impressed by their commitment to pretending Edna is real, Halle Kiefer of Vulture.com joked that the tribute features some of the participants' \"most impressive onscreen roles to date\". Rachel Kolb of Uproxx wrote that having Edna design new costumes for the family in \"Incredibles 2\" would be one way to ensure that the sequel is better than the original. Beginning in 2018, Edna has been used heavily in \"Incredibles 2\"'s first advertising campaign. In February 2018, the character's likeness was used heavily on several bus and subway posters within Manhattan, New York surrounding New York Fashion Week. Disney-Pixar's announced on their Twitter account: \"If you thought she’d miss #NYFW, you thought wrong, dahling\". The poster features a black and white closeup image of the character with only her lips colored red, accompanied by the caption \"It's been too long, dahlings.\" Bucksbaum called the poster \"stunning\".\n"}

A controversial product of the Civil War and in effect only until 1867, when the state's present constitution was adopted, the 1864 document was short-lived.\n\nThe 1864 constitution was largely the product of strong Unionists, who had control of the state at the time. The document outlawed slavery, disenfranchised Southern sympathizers, and reapportioned the General Assembly based upon the number of white inhabitants. This provision further diminished the power of the small counties where the majority of the state's large former slave population lived. One of the framers' goals was to reduce the influence of Southern sympathizers, who had almost caused the state to secede in 1861.\n\nThe convention which drafted the document convened on April 27, 1864 and completed their work by September 6. The constitution was then submitted to the people for ratification on October 13, 1864. It was approved by a vote of 30,174 to 29,799 (50.31% to 49.69%). This was a very controversial result, since the state, though part of the Union, still had many Confederate ties and sympathies. The tally of those voting at their usual polling places was opposed to this Constitution by 29,536 to 27,541. However, the constitution secured ratification after the soldiers' votes were tallied. Soldiers from Maryland serving in the Union Army voted overwhelmingly in favor, 2,633 to 263.\n\nBy design, the constitution disenfranchised those Marylanders who had left the state to fight for or live in the Confederacy or who had given it \"any aid, comfort, countenace, or support.\" It also made it difficult for them to regain the full rights of citizenship and required office-holders to take a new oath of allegiance to support the state and union and to repudiate the rebellion. \n\nFurthermore, the influence of the small counties which had large slave populations, and tended to have supported secession and to have opposed Union efforts during the war, was reduced by basing representation solely on white population. The constitution did emancipate the slaves, but this did not mean equality. The franchise was restricted to \"white\" males. Additionally, the Maryland legislature refused to ratify both the 14th Amendment, which conferred citizenship rights on former slaves, and the 15th Amendment, which gave the vote to African Americans.\n\nMaryland's 1864 constitution created for the first time the position of Lieutenant Governor. The office was held by only one person, Christopher C. Cox, until a 1971 amendment to the 1867 constitution re-created the position.\n\n\n"}

As a film student at UCLA in the mid-1980s, Mancini was amused by the hysteria surrounding the Cabbage Patch Kids, and that the ubiquitous, slightly homely dolls were disappearing from toy shelves and prompting physical fights between parents. Mancini's father had worked in the advertising industry all his life, and he knew how effective marketing could result in consumer bedlam. Based on this, Mancini wanted to write a dark satire about how marketing affected children, with his first effort being as the co-writer of \"Child's Play\" (1988).\n\nMancini was the executive producer of \"Bride of Chucky\" and \"Cult of Chucky\", the latter in which he directed along with \"Seed of Chucky\", as well as \"Curse of Chucky\", all in the \"Child's Play\" franchise. Along with Kevin Williamson and Clive Barker, Mancini is one of the few openly gay writers in the slasher film genre. In 2007, he won the EyeGore award for career contributions to the horror genre.

It evolves in time according to the second-order differential equation:\n\nwhere \"x\" is the position coordinate—which is a function of the time \"t\", and \"μ\" is a scalar parameter indicating the nonlinearity and the strength of the damping.\n\nThe Van der Pol oscillator was originally proposed by the Dutch electrical engineer and physicist Balthasar van der Pol while he was working at Philips. Van der Pol found stable oscillations, which he subsequently called relaxation-oscillations and are now known as a type of limit cycle in electrical circuits employing vacuum tubes. When these circuits were driven near the limit cycle, they become entrained, i.e. the driving signal pulls the current along with it. Van der Pol and his colleague, van der Mark, reported in the September 1927 issue of Nature that at certain drive frequencies an irregular noise was heard, which was later found to be the result of deterministic chaos.\n\nThe Van der Pol equation has a long history of being used in both the physical and biological sciences. For instance, in biology, Fitzhugh and Nagumo extended the equation in a planar field as a model for action potentials of neurons. The equation has also been utilised in seismology to model the two plates in a geological fault, and in studies of phonation to model the right and left vocal fold oscillators.\n\nLiénard's theorem can be used to prove that the system has a limit cycle. Applying the Liénard transformation formula_2 where the dot indicates the time derivative, the Van der Pol oscillator can be written in its two-dimensional form:\nAnother commonly used form based on the transformation formula_5 leads to:\n\nTwo interesting regimes for the characteristics of the unforced oscillator are:\n\n\nOne can also write a time-independent Hamiltonian formalism for the Van der Pol oscillator by augmenting it to a four-dimensional autonomous dynamical system using an auxiliary second-order nonlinear differential equation as follows:\n\nNote that the dynamics of the original Van der Pol oscillator is not affected due to the one-way coupling between the time-evolutions of \"x\" and \"y\" variables. A Hamiltonian \"H\" for this system of equations can be shown to be\n\nwhere formula_12 and formula_13 are the conjugate momenta corresponding to \"x\" and \"y\", respectively. This may, in principle, lead to quantization of the Van der Pol oscillator. Such a Hamiltonian also connects the geometric phase of the limit cycle system having time dependent parameters with the Hannay angle of the corresponding Hamiltonian system.\n\nThe forced, or driven, Van der Pol oscillator takes the 'original' function and adds a driving function \"A\"sin(\"ωt\") to give a differential equation of the form:\n\nwhere \"A\" is the amplitude, or displacement, of the wave function and \"ω\" is its angular velocity.\n\nAuthor James Gleick described a vacuum tube Van der Pol oscillator in his book from 1987 \"\". According to a \"New York Times\" article, Gleick received a modern electronic Van der Pol oscillator from a reader in 1988.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1961798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1961798", "title": "Mercedes-Benz W125 Rekordwagen", "text": "Mercedes-Benz W125 Rekordwagen\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz W125 Rekordwagen was an experimental, high-speed automobile produced in the late 1930s. The streamlined car was derived from the 1937 open-wheel race car Mercedes-Benz W125 Formel-Rennwagen, of which also a streamlined version was raced at the non-championship Avusrennen in Berlin.\n\nThe main difference to the Grand Prix race car, which had to adhere to the limit, was the engine. While the GP car had the 8-cylinder inline M125, which was rather tall, the record car was fitted with a V12 engine that was lower, which reduced drag.\n\nThe car is on display in the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart.\n\n\nRudolf Caracciola's record of 432.7 km/h (268 mph) over the flying kilometre on 28 January 1938, remained the fastest ever officially timed speed on a public road until broken on 5 November 2017 by Koenigsegg in an Agera RS driven by Niklas Lilja, achieving 445.6 km/h (276.9 mph) on a closed highway in Nevada. It also was the fastest speed ever recorded in Germany until Rico Anthes bested it with a Top Fuel Dragster on the Hockenheimring drag strip.\n\nThis record breaking run was made on the Reichs-Autobahn A5 between Frankfurt and Darmstadt, where onlookers were rattled by the brutal boom of the side spewing exhaust stacks as the silver car hurtled past. By nine that morning, Caracciola and team chief Alfred Neubauer were having a celebration breakfast at the Park Hotel in Frankfurt.\n\nPopular driver Bernd Rosemeyer was killed later the same day when trying to beat that record for Auto Union. This also put an end to the record attempts of Mercedes, even though Hans Stuck later wanted to beat the overall land speed record with the Porsche-designed Mercedes-Benz T80 which was powered by a airplane engine.\n\nIn 1937, Joseph Mickl the chief R&D engineer of Porsche files a patent with a high speed vehicle, which makes use of a whole range of tips and tricks making it most probably the most advanced vehicle of its kind for that time. This patent, is considered as the successor of the w125 Rekordwagen .\n\nIt is possible to identify many features on this patented design that spun out of the research work of famous researchers of that time such as Ludwig Prandtl, Wunibald Kamm, Theodore von Kármán etc. The streamlined, low drag body of the vehicle is equipped with an air inlet for the engine which is conveniently located at the maximum static pressure region at the \"nose\". The body completely engulfs the wheels thus eliminating their additional aerodynamic drag. The vehicle is equipped with 6 wheels (occurring long before the Tyrrell P34 of the late 70s). The main reason for that design choice is the maximization of the contact area with the ground with a simultaneous reduction of the frontal area of the vehicle (i.e. low drag). At the same time the rear wheel axles could remain lower thus reducing the frontal area as well as the center of gravity of the vehicle.\n\nThe body of the vehicle is formed like a very basic diffuser thus using the Bernoulli principle in order to create downforce and improve stability and traction at high speeds. This may be one of the very first uses of the Ground Effect, decades before it appeared on the BRM and Chaparral Formula One racers of the 60s.\n\nAnother great innovation of that design/patent of Mickl was the integration of an inverted wing which was responsible for the creation of downforce, thus increasing the stability of the vehicle. Most of the people believe that the use of wings to create downforce on vehicles is an idea of the 1960s pioneered by Colin Chapman and his Lotus 49 racer. However, the truth is that the German rocket powered rail-racer of the late 1920s Opel-RAK.3 was the earliest example of a vehicle equipped with wings creating downforce. This vehicle, however, did not use inverted wings but rather normal wings that were pitched to a negative angle of attack such that they would generate \"negative lift\".\n\nThe racer of Mickl, however, employs an inverted wing, located directly on top of the rear wheel axles and in the \"clean\" air inflow stream in order to produce downforce and to translate it directly to tire traction at high speeds. The inverted wing was even equipped with a large aileron, such that the driver could adjust the generated downforce in such a way that the vehicle could achieve high traction during the acceleration phase and low drag (i.e. low downforce) during the high-speed phase of the race. A further invention was presented with the implementation of an airbrake option. In this case the aileron of the wing would deflect almost 90° thus hugely increasing drag and acting as a high speed air brake. That action could be manually controlled by the driver via a separate air-brake lever or could be coupled to the wheel brake system of the vehicle.\n"}
{"id": "1961811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1961811", "title": "Michael Kiske", "text": "Michael Kiske\n\nMichael Kiske (born January 24, 1968) is a German singer best known as the lead vocalist for the German power metal band Helloween. After his departure from the band in 1993, Kiske recorded four solo albums, participated on various metal and rock related projects, such as Avantasia, Place Vendome and Kiske/Somerville, while he also performed with numerous bands as a guest vocalist. In late 2009, he formed the hard rock band Unisonic and began touring again after 17 years of absence. In October 2017, Kiske joined Helloween and Kai Hansen for the Pumpkins United World Tour that continued through 2018. A live recording of the Helloween tour entitled \"United Alive\" and \"United Alive in Madrid\" was released in 2019 and a new Helloween album with Kiske and Hansen is planned for 2020.\n\nPrior to joining Helloween, Kiske sang with the German band Ill Prophecy at the age of 17. The band recorded a demo, but it was never released commercially.\n\nAt the age of eighteen, Kiske was asked to join the German power metal band Helloween, which was fronted by singer/guitarist Kai Hansen. Hansen had some difficulties being both the lead guitarist and lead vocalist, and it was decided that a new vocalist would be needed. Kiske rejected Helloween's first offer, because he disliked the sound of the band's \"Walls of Jericho\" album, but accepted the second and joined Helloween in late 1986. Michael's first album with the band was 1987's \"Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I\", widely considered to be one of Helloween's best albums and a milestone in the creation of the power metal genre. The album's worldwide success enabled the band to embark on an extensive world tour and perform at famous festivals such as Monsters of Rock. Helloween went on to release \"Keeper of the Seven Keys Part II\" in 1988, which went gold in Germany and brought even more success than its predecessor. The \"Keeper of the Seven Keys\" albums proved to be highly influential and aided in the formation of a new wave of European power metal bands, such as Blind Guardian, Stratovarius, HammerFall and Edguy.\n\nAfter the completion of the band's 1988 headlining tour, the album \"Live in the UK\" was released, while Kai Hansen left the band and was replaced by guitarist Roland Grapow. Legal disputes with their record company, prevented Helloween from releasing new material until 1991's \"Pink Bubbles Go Ape\", which was followed by 1993's \"Chameleon\". These two albums saw the band moving away from their power metal roots and experimenting with different sounds. Both \"Pink Bubbles Go Ape\" and \"Chameleon\" were commercial failures and resulted in Kiske leaving Helloween. Kiske was fired from the band in 1993, reportedly for personal reasons. He was replaced by Pink Cream 69's Andi Deris, who has remained with Helloween ever since.\n\nKiske was rumored to be Bruce Dickinson's replacement, after he departed from Iron Maiden in 1993, but the position was filled by Blaze Bayley.\n\nIn 2016, it was announced that Michael Kiske would join Helloween, together with Kai Hansen, for a reunion tour that would take place during 2017 and 2018. The Pumpkins United World Tour started in October 2017 in South America and continued in Europe with concerts lasting close to three hours. On December 8, 2017 the single \"Pumpkins United\", featuring the reunited line-up, was released. The reunion tour continued throughout 2018 in Japan, Russia, Ukraine, Europe, North America, Canada and Latin America. The Pumpkins United World Tour was the biggest one in the band's history as it comprised 69 shows and lasted for 14 months. A live DVD/Blu-ray entitled \"United Alive\" and the live album \"United Alive in Madrid\" were released on October 4, 2019. \n\nThe band embarked on a Brazilian tour in September 2019, which started at Rockfest (Sao Paulo) and ended with their performance at the Rock In Rio Festival. A new studio album with Kiske and Hansen is due to be released in 2020.\n\nOn August 16, 1996, three years after leaving Helloween, Kiske released his first solo album, \"Instant Clarity\". The album featured guest appearances by Adrian Smith of Iron Maiden, Kai Hansen and Ciriaco Taraxes and contained songs in a wide variety of styles. A music video for the ballad \"Always\", dedicated to deceased Helloween drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg, was filmed and produced in New York City. During the same year he also wrote a book, 'Kunst Und Materialismus', which is only available in German. \"Instant Clarity\" was reissued in 2006 with the addition of 4 bonus tracks.\n\nHis second solo album, \"Readiness to Sacrifice\", which included some songs by Ciriaco Taraxes, was released in Korea and Japan in 1999 and in Europe in 2001. The music on the album featured Michael moving completely away from his heavy metal roots and even contained two symphonic songs.\n\nIn 2003, out of desire to make rock music again, Kiske formed a project, named SupaRed. They released a self-titled album in January 2003. This album had a modern rock sound and a song structure, distinct from both his solo albums and the heavy metal sound of Helloween. The project was under promoted and unsuccessful and he dissolved the band.\n\nIn 2006, Michael Kiske released his third full-length solo album under the name of \"Kiske\". The album contained songs in a mellow, acoustic singer-songwriter style and was a step away from the sound of his previous solo albums. According to Michael \"It's a healthy-careless and musically free album. I am very proud of this record because it is a true statement from myself\".\n\nIn 2008, Kiske released his fourth solo work, entitled \"Past in Different Ways\". The album contained acoustic re-arrangements of his old Helloween material and one new song. According to Kiske the album \"on one hand shows that I don't reject my past just because I'm a different person today, and on the other hand it can maybe give people who were part of that past a different view at those songs\".\n\nIn 2000, Tobias Sammet (vocalist of the band Edguy) asked Kiske to participate in the rock opera project Avantasia. Michael agreed to sing on the project, in the role of Lugaid Vandroiy, but only under the nickname of \"Ernie\". The nickname was printed on the back of the first Avantasia release, \"The Metal Opera\", but not on the sequel, \"The Metal Opera Part II\", where he was featured under his real name. Michael said in interviews that, at that time, he did not want people to link him to heavy metal anymore. He had a main role in the concept of the Metal Opera albums and performed on the songs \"Reach Out for the Light\", \"Breaking Away\", \"Farewell\", \"Avantasia\", \"The Tower\", \"The Seven Angels\" and \"No Return\".\n\nDuring 2007, he recorded guest vocals for two Avantasia tracks; \"Promised Land\" and \"Lost in Space [Extended Version]\", both of which appeared on the \"Lost in Space Part I & II\" compilation album (\"Promised Land\" was also featured on the EP \"Lost in Space Part II\").\n\nIn 2008, Michael took part in the Avantasia album \"The Scarecrow\", singing lead on the track \"Shelter From The Rain\" and backing on the title track and on \"What Kind of Love\".\n\nDuring 2010, Kiske performed on the Avantasia albums \"The Wicked Symphony\" and \"Angel of Babylon\", singing on the tracks \"Wastelands\", \"Runaway Train\" and \"Stargazers\". Between November and December, he also took part in \"The Metal Opera Comes to Town Tour\", sharing the stage with Tobias Sammet, Kai Hansen, Jørn Lande, Bob Catley, Amanda Somerville, Sascha Paeth, and Oliver Hartmann among others.\n\nOn August 6, 2011, Michael performed with Avantasia at the Wacken Open Air Festival.\n\nDuring 2013, Kiske took part in the Avantasia album \"The Mystery of Time\", singing on the songs \"Where Clock Hands Freeze\", \"Savior in the Clockwork\" and \"Dweller in a Dream\". Between April and August, he also participated on \"The Mystery World Tour\", which included 10 European festival appearances and 3-hour long shows in South America, Japan, Russia and Europe.\n\nOn August 2, 2014, Michael performed with Avantasia at the Wacken Open Air festival once again.\n\nIn 2016, Kiske participated in the Avantasia album \"Ghostlights\", singing on the songs \"Ghostlights\", \"Unchain The Light\" and on the bonus track \"Wake Up To The Moon\". Between March and August of the same year, he was part of the biggest Avantasia tour, entitled \"Ghostlights World Tour\", which consisted of more than 40 concerts in Europe, North America, South America, Canada, Japan, Russia and Scandinavia.\n\nDuring 2019, Michael participated in the Avantasia album \"Moonglow\", singing on the song \"Requiem For A Dream\".\n\nIn 2005, Kiske took part in the Place Vendome project, on Frontiers Records. Place Vendome consisted of Dennis Ward (bass and production), Kosta Zafiriou (drums) and Uwe Reitenauer (guitars) from the German band Pink Cream 69, Gunther Werno (keyboards) from the band Vanden Plas and Kiske on vocals. The project's debut album, \"Place Vendome\", was a blend of melodic hard rock and AOR (comparable to the sound of bands such as Foreigner or Journey) and the majority of the songwriting was provided by Dennis Ward.\n\nIn 2009, the Place Vendome project released its second album entitled \"Streets of Fire\". A video was filmed for the song \"My Guardian Angel\", marking Michael's visual return since 1996. The songwriting for the second album was provided by musicians Magnus Karlsson (Primal Fear), Torsti Spoof (Leverage), Ronny Milianowicz (Saint Deamon) and Robert Sall (Work of Art).\n\nIn 2013, Frontiers Records released Place Vendome's third album entitled \"Thunder in the Distance\". The songwriters for this release were Alessandro Del Vecchio (Hardline), Timo Tolkki (ex-Stratovarius), Brett Jones, Tommy Denander (Radioactive), Magnus Karlsson (Primal Fear), Sören Kronqvist (Sunstorm), Roberto Tiranti and Andrea Cantarelli (Labyrinth). A video was filmed for the song \"Talk To Me\".\n\nIn 2017, the Place Vendome project released its fourth album entitled \"Close to the Sun\". The album featured songs written by Magnus Karlsson, Alessandro Del Vecchio, Jani Liimatainen (Cain's Offering, ex-Sonata Arctica), Olaf Thorsen (Vision Divine, Labyrinth), Fabio Lione (Vision Divine, Angra, ex-Rhapsody of Fire), Simone Mularoni (DGM), Aldo Lonobile (Secret Sphere) and Mike Palace. In addition, it was be the first Place Vendome album to feature guest guitar solos by Gus G (Firewind, Ozzy Osbourne), Kai Hansen (ex-Helloween, Gamma Ray, Unisonic), Mandy Meyer (Krokus, ex-Asia, Unisonic), Alfred Koffler (Pink Cream 69), Michael Klein, Magnus Karlsson and Simone Mularoni.\n\nIn late 2009, Kiske collaborated with female vocalist Amanda Somerville in a duet project, put together by Frontiers Records. The project was named Kiske/Somerville and it marked the contribution of musicians Mat Sinner, Magnus Karlsson, Sander Gommans, Martin Schmidt and Jimmy Kresic. The self-titled debut album was released on September 24, 2010. Two videos were filmed for the songs \"Silence\" and \"If I Had A Wish\", enabling most of the participants to actually meet in person.\n\nThe second Kiske/Somerville album entitled \"City of Heroes\" was released on April 17, 2015. Mat Sinner, Magnus Karlsson and Veronika Lukesova handled the instrumentation, while Jacob Hansen and Sinner were in charge of the production. Two music videos were filmed for the songs \"City Of Heroes\" and \"Walk On Water\".\n\nOn November 10, 2009, Michael formed the band Unisonic together with Dennis Ward, Kosta Zafiriou and Mandy Meyer. Unisonic began a short tour in June 2010, playing some warm-up shows in Germany and performing at Sweden Rock Festival and Masters of Rock Festival as well. This small tour marked Kiske's return to the live stages after 17 years of absence. In March 2011, Kai Hansen joined the band, and on October 15 the new line-up performed its first show at Loud Park Festival (Japan).\n\nThe band released the EP \"Ignition\", together with their first video for the song \"Unisonic\" in January 2012, through EarMusic (Edel AG). The release of their self-titled debut album followed on March 30, 2012. The debut album entered several international music charts, scoring the highest points on the Finnish albums chart, Japanese Albums Chart, German Albums Chart and Swedish albums chart.\n\nUnisonic embarked on their first world tour in May 2012 performing in South America and in various European music festivals, such as Masters of Rock, Hellfest, Rock Hard Festival and Gods of Metal among others. The second half of the tour included concerts in Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Russia, Spain and Germany.\n\nThe band's second EP, \"For the Kingdom\", came out in May 2014, the video for the song \"Exceptional\" followed in July, while their second album, \"Light of Dawn\", was released on August 1, 2014. \"Light of Dawn\" entered several international music charts, scoring the highest entries on the Finnish albums chart, German Albums Chart, Swiss albums chart, Czech albums chart and Japanese Albums Chart.\n\nThe band embarked on a summer festival tour in July 2014, performing at Masters Of Rock, Leyendas del Rock, Moscow Metal Meeting, Bang Your Head, Skogsrojet and Rock Pod Kamenom. A Japanese and European tour together with Edguy followed, while the band's final show was at the Knock Out Festival in December 2014.\n\nOn August 5, 2016, Unisonic performed their first show at Wacken Open Air Festival, which was recorded and released under the title \"Live in Wacken\" on July 21, 2017.\n\nIn 1995, Kiske participated as a guest on Gamma Ray's (Kai Hansen's band, formed after his departure from Helloween in late 1988) \"Land of the Free\" album, singing lead vocals on the song \"Time To Break Free\" and additional vocals on the title track.\n\nDuring 2002, Michael sang the song \"Key to the Universe\", which was featured on Timo Tolkki's (guitarist of the band Stratovarius) solo album \"Hymn to Life\".\n\nIn 2003, Kiske took part in the metal opera \"Days of Rising Doom\" by Aina, in the role of the Narrator, singing on the songs \"Revelations\", \"Silver Maiden\", \"Serendipity\" and \"Restoration\". During the same year he also sang on the duet \"Heroes\" (together with Jørn Lande), featured on Masterplan's self-titled debut album.\n\nIn 2004, Michael sang on the duet \"The Encounter\", together with the female vocalist of the band Thalion on their debut album \"Another Sun\".\n\nDuring 2005, Kiske was a guest on the heavy metal album \"Execution\" by the band Tribuzy, singing on the duet \"Absolution\". Following this participation Kiske also sang as a guest on the song \"Judas at the Opera\", featured on Edguy's \"Superheroes \"EP.\n\nIn 2007, Michael sang on the duet \"Breathe in Water\", together with the female vocalist of the band Indigo Dying on their self-titled debut album.\n\nDuring 2008, Timo Tolkki departed from Stratovarius and formed the band Revolution Renaissance. The band's debut album, \"New Era\", was recorded by session musicians and Kiske on the role of the main singer, performing vocals for the tracks \"I Did It My Way\", \"Angel\", \"Keep The Flame Alive\", \"Last Night on Earth\" and \"Revolution Renaissance\".\n\nIn 2009, he was a guest on Trick or Treat's album \"Tin Soldiers\", singing all vocals on the song \"Hello Moon\" and additional lead vocals on the duet \"Tears Against Your Smile\".\n\nDuring 2010, he recorded guest vocals for the song \"All You Need To Know\", featured on Gamma Ray's \"To The Metal\" album.\n\nIn 2011, Kiske appeared as a special guest in Gamma Ray's concert in Pratteln (Switzerland). The full show was released in both CD and DVD under the name \"Skeletons & Majesties Live\" in 2012. Michael sings on the songs \"Time To Break Free\", \"A While in Dreamland\" and \"Future World\".\n\nIn 2012, Michael sang the song \"The Ethereal Dream (Reprise)\", featured on the album \"34613\" by the project Tomorrow's Outlook.\n\nDuring 2013, Kiske took part in Timo Tolkki's metal opera project Avalon. Michael sang the self-titled track on the project's debut album \"The Land of New Hope\". In the same year he also sang as a guest on the duet \"Fly\", featured on Infinita Symphonia's self-titled album. During December, he participated in the \"Christmas Metal Symphony 2013 tour\", sharing the stage with Joey Belladonna, Udo Dirkschneider, Chuck Billy, Joacim Cans, Floor Jansen and a symphonic orchestra.\n\nIn 2014, he sang on the duet \"Black And White Forever\", featured on Starchild's self-titled debut album.\n\nDuring 2015, Kiske sang as a guest on the title track of the Wolfpakk album \"Rise of the Animal\". In August of the same year he sang as a special guest with Rock Meets Classic (a project featuring Mat Sinner and the Bohemian Symphony Orchestra Prague) performing at the Rock of Ages Festival and at Wacken Open Air Festival. On September 19, he performed at the Rock In Rio festival with the band Noturnall.\n\nIn 2016, he participated as a guest vocalist on the Hansen & Friends \"XXX : 30 Years of Metal\" album and on the project's performance at Wacken Open Air Festival. The live performance was recorded and released on both CD and DVD under the title Hansen & Friends \"Thank You Wacken\", on June 23, 2017. During the same year he also sang on the duet \"Halleluja\" with Swedish singer Aino Löwenmark, featured on her album \"Human\". He returned to work on this recording with ex.SupaRed-members guitar player Sandro Giampietro and drummer Jürgen Spiegel.\n\nDuring 2018, Kiske sang on the duets \"Angel Of Light\" and \"King Thorgan's Hymn\", featured on the album \"Legend of Valley Doom part 2\" by Marius Danielsen.\n\nIn comparison to Kai Hansen, Kiske had a more vibrant and clean voice. Some fans and critics have likened his singing style and range to that of Geoff Tate or a young Samson-era Bruce Dickinson, with shades of Rob Halford. He has a tenor type voice and possesses an almost 4 octave vocal range, as he is capable of reaching extremely high notes (A5) and low baritone notes (E2) as well.

In 1979 he was elected to the Gurk local council, and was selected immediately to be vice mayor, a position he retained for twelve years. During this time period, he was also elected to the state parliament (\"Landtag\") of Carinthia, in which he served for the FPÖ from 1982 through 1994. In 1991, he was elected mayor of Gurk with 53.4% of the vote, and also remained a member of the \"Landtag\". In 2004, he was sent as a representative of Carinthia to the Federal Council of Austria (the \"Bundesrat\"), where he again sat with the FPÖ.\n\nIn the Federal Council, Kampl was closely allied with controversial FPÖ leader Jörg Haider, who he had helped propel to the party leadership in 1986. Kampl calls himself \"very homeland-connected\" and nationalist. When the FPÖ split in April 2005, Kampl followed Haider to his new party, the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ). He resigned from the party on 7 June 2005 as the result of a controversy (see below), and left its parliamentary fraction on 1 November 2005, sitting the rest of his term as an independent.\n\nOn 19 April 2005 Kampl made a speech against the rehabilitation of Austrian armed-forced members who had deserted during World War II. He argued that the deserters were \"assassins of battle comrades\", and criticized what he called the \"brutal persecution\" of Austrian Nazis after 1945, saying that \"more than 99% of Austrians\" had been members of the Nazi party. He was heavily pressured to resign, and agreed to do so on 28 April. However, about a month later (on 29 May), he said he stood by his views (although he said he may have phrased them differently in retrospect), and would not in fact be resigning. He attributed his decision not to resign partly to what he called the \"provocative\" manner in which Federal Council President Georg Pehm (a Social Democrat) had demanded he do so. He did, however, resign his membership in the BZÖ, saying he did not want to burden the party with the controversy.\n\nKampl's backtracking on resignation caused an even bigger controversy because, coincidentally, he was scheduled to take over the six-month rotating presidency of the Federal Council on 1 July. Left-leaning lawmakers demanded that Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel intervene to prevent Kampl from assuming the presidency of the upper house, and threatened a walkout if he was allowed to do so. In the end, the Federal Council resolved matters itself by passing a constitutional amendment, informally labelled \"Lex Kampl\" (Latin for \"Kampl's law\"), allowing the Council to, by a two-thirds vote, replace anyone scheduled to take over the rotating presidency with a different member of the same party. The amendment was agreed upon by all four main parties (including the FPÖ and BZÖ) and passed unanimously, although BZÖ member Roland Zellot left the chamber before the vote. The amendment entered into force on 25 June, just in time to prevent Kampl from becoming president of the Council.\n"}

Bombardier Transportation is one of the world's largest companies in the rail vehicle and equipment manufacturing and servicing industry. Bombardier Transportation is headquartered in Berlin, Germany. There are many regional offices, production and development facilities worldwide. In February 2020 Bombardier announced an agreement for Alstom to purchase the entire rail transportation division.\n\nBombardier Transportation produces a wide range of products including passenger rail vehicles, locomotives, bogies, propulsion and controls.\n\nDanny Di Perna is the president and chief operating officer of Bombardier Transportation. In February 2020, the company had 36,050 employees, and 63 manufacturing and engineering locations around the world.\n\nBombardier Transportation's first order for mass transit rolling stock was in 1974 for the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) (Montreal transport authority) to build metro trains for the Montreal Metro.\n\nThe core of the Transportation group was formed with the purchase of Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW) in 1975.\n\nWith the 1975 purchase, Bombardier acquired MLW's LRC (Light, Rapid, Comfortable) tilting train design which it produced in the 1980s. In 1987, Bombardier bought the assets of US railcar manufacturers Budd and Pullman-Standard.\n\nIn the late 1980s Bombardier Transportation gained a manufacturing presence in Europe with the acquisition of a 45% share in BN Constructions Ferroviaires et Métalliques (whose principal site was in Brugge (Bruges), Belgium) in 1986, and the acquisition of ANF-Industries (whose principal site was in Crespin, France, near the Belgian border) in 1989.\n\nIn 1990, Procor Engineering Ltd. of Horbury near Wakefield, UK; a manufacturer of bodyshells, was acquired, and renamed Bombardier Prorail.\n\nIn 1991 the group purchased Urban Transportation Development Corporation (UTDC) from the Government of Ontario, which had previously acquired Hawker Siddeley Canada. MLW was sold to General Electric in 1988. GE ended railcar operations in Canada in 1993. Bombardier Transportation continues to operate the railcar operations in Thunder Bay.\n\nIn 1991 the grouping Bombardier Eurorail was formed consisting of the company's European subsidiaries; BN, ANF-Industrie, Prorail, and BWS. In 1992, the company acquired Mexico's largest railway rolling-stock manufacturer, Concarril, from the Mexican government.\n\nIn 1995 Waggonfabrik Talbot KG in Aachen, Germany, and in 1998, Deutsche Waggonbau AG (DWA), and Ateliers de Constructions Mécaniques de Vevey in Vevey, Switzerland, were acquired. DWA encompassed the major portion of the railway equipment industry of the former East Germany (\"Kombinat Schienenfahrzeugbau\"), and had its principal sites in Bautzen and Görlitz.\n\nIn 2001 Bombardier Transportation acquired Adtranz from DaimlerChrysler, and became by many measurements the Western world's largest rail-equipment manufacturer. The takeover was approved by the EU competition commission subject to a number of minor clauses including the divestment of Bombardier's stake in Adtranz/Stadler joint venture \"Stadler Pankow GmbH\" (sold to Stadler Rail), and an agreement to retain Kiepe as a supplier, and ELIN as a partner for a number of years after the acquisition. The addition of ADtranz made Bombardier a manufacturer of locomotives along with its existing product lines of passenger carriages, multiple-unit trains, and trams. With the acquisition of ADtranz, Bombardier also gained competence in the electrical propulsion components business.\n\nAfter the Adtranz acquisition in 2001, Bombardier Transportation moved its core manufacturing strategy for Europe with a few legacy plants in North America for the smaller North American market:\n\nAdditionally a number of plants would have specialised manufacturing roles, including Česká Lípa (Czech Republic) and the Pafawag facility in Poland which would supply parts and welded structures, and sites in Vienna (Austria) and Bautzen (Germany) which would specialise in light rail vehicle (LRV) manufacture whilst double deck trains for the German market would be manufactured in Görlitz. Other sites had their work mandate reduced in scope, or were closed.\n\nIn 2004 due to overcapacity in the European passenger train industry, Bombardier announced a restructuring program resulting in the closure of several plants; in the UK, the bogie production site at Pride Park, Derby, Bombardier Prorail (Wakefield), and a maintenance facility in Doncaster were closed; in mainland Europe, the plants at Pratteln, Kalmar and Amadora were to be closed, as well as plants in Ammendorf and Vetschau in eastern Germany which had been slated for closure in 2001.\n\nIn late 2012 Bombardier announced the closure of the Bombardier Talbot plant in Aachen, and a reduction in workforce in the transportation division of 1,200 people.\n\nThe company obtained two major orders in 2014: San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART) ordered an additional 365 rail cars from Bombardier in early 2014, to be assembled at Bombardier's plant in Plattsburgh, New York; Transport for London (United Kingdom) awarded a £1.3 billion contract to provide 70 Aventra trains for Crossrail, and included the building of a maintenance depot at Old Oak Common.\n\nIn May 2014 Bombardier extended its presence in Australia by purchasing a 100% stake in Rail Signalling Service (RSS), an Australian company focused on designing and constructing rail signalling solutions. In Sep 2014 the downsizing and eventual closure of the Maryborough factory was announced, the factory closed in Dec 2015.\n\nIn January 2015 the government of Hungary nationalised the loss-making and under-utilised Bombardier carriage works at Dunakeszi (, Hungarian), acquiring a 64.9% stake for $7.8 million.\n\nIn May 2015 the parent company Bombardier Inc. announced that it intended to split or spin-off Bombardier Transportation as a separate publicly traded company, while retaining control as the majority owner. Lutz Bertling, president and CEO of Bombardier Transportation stated that a primary motivation for the sell off was to increase the company's financial flexibility, for potential acquisitions or consolidations, allowing the company to better compete with an anticipated Chinese presence in the European market. An IPO was planned for late 2015. In late 2015 the public investor Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ) acquired a US$1.5 billion stake in Bombardier Transportation in the form of a bond/equity hybrid, with the shares returned to CDPQ dependent on the financial performance of the company. The investment initially representing a 30% stake - a valuation of $5 billion. The sale was required in part to continue the financing of the parent company's CSeries jet, a major cause of a $4.6billion loss for the parent company in 2015.\n\nIn late 2015 the National Railway Company of Belgium awarded a Bombardier/Alstom consortium a large €3.3 billion contract for 1,362 M7 doubledecker passenger rail vehicles, with a value to Bombardier of around €2.1 billion.\n\nIn August 2016 Bombardier opened a production facility in Isando, Johannesburg, South Africa. The site was specialised for the production of electric traction equipment (\"Mitrac\").\n\nIn December 2016 citing a 'challenging market environment', Bombardier said that a 'strategic realignment' would put 'a strong focus on product standardisation and site specialisation in order to become more efficient and effective'. Up to 2,200 jobs are expected to go, with the German plants in Hennigsdorf, Görlitz and Bautzen reportedly most affected.\n\nBy 2018, Bombardier was the 3rd largest rail-equipment manufacturer in the Western World and fourth globally, eclipsed by CRRC, Siemens and Alstom.\n\nOn February 13, 2020, the multi-national train maker Alstom SA, based in France, agreed to buy the Bombardier Transportation division and signed a Memorandum of Agreement to do so for between €5.8 billion and €6.2 billion. The deal required approval by Alstom shareholders at a meeting to be held in October 2020 and approval by European regulators. Bombardier's major shareholder, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, had already agreed to the sale.\n\nBombardier's standard metro vehicles are the mid-sized fully automated and driverless Bombardier Innovia Metro with the option for linear induction motor propulsion or a conventional rotary motor, and the high-capacity customizable Movia Metro, which is powered by conventional motors and can also be fully automated. In addition, Bombardier has produced many custom metro models not based on either model.\n\n\n\n\nBombardier's locomotives are mostly linked to their acquisition of Adtranz and Montreal Locomotive Works, as well as joint venture with Alstom. Via the acquisition of Adtranz, Bombardier was able to obtain some cornerstone technologies, such as the three-phase drive technology developed by plant in Mannheim, which is the worldwide center of competence for the development of locomotives.\nOther than the LRC, all other locomotives were based on European designs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBombardier also supplies propulsion units, train-control systems, bogies, and other parts, and maintains train fleets.\n\nIn addition to manufacturing a wide variety of passenger rail vehicles and locomotives, Bombardier Transportation provides services for commuter train providers.\n\nBombardier Transportation has production facilities or product development in:\n\nIn early 2013, Deutsche Bahn announced that it was suing Bombardier for €350 million because of some serious defects in trains used on the suburban S-Bahn rail network in Berlin. This was in addition to the €160 million it was asking for from Bombardier because of problems with more than 200 regional trains operating in southern Germany and problems with the brakes in regional and local trains in Munich. The matter was settled out of court in March 2015. Lutz Bertling, head of Bombardier's transportation division at the time, confirmed the two firms had come to an agreement, saying: \"The settlement is a positive signal for our future cooperation.\"\n\nIn January 2015, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that South Korea's Special Investigation Unit for anti-corruption produced a report accusing Bombardier Transportation of corruption in the pursuit of the 2004 contract to build an 18 km elevated Light Rapid Transit (LRT) rail system called the Everline connecting the Giheung Station on the Bundang (Yellow Line) of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway system to a large amusement park named Everland, via Yongin, the 12th largest city in South Korea, about 30 km from central Seoul.\n\nThe investigation report alleges that Bombardier provided gifts and trips to Canada for civil servants and politicians involved in the contract decision, which was based on revenue expected from an inflated estimate of 180,000 passengers per day using the service. It also alleges that Bombardier created a $2-million slush fund for the Canadian citizen Kim Hak-Pil, a high-ranking Bombardier executive in South Korea. Bombardier has consistently denied the corruption allegations, stating that \"They were not pleasure trips. There is a need to convince the people that our technology works well... If it had been corruption, they would have charged us.\" The statute of limitations has now expired, due to lack of evidence according to Bombardier.\n\nEverline operation has been financially troubled since construction was completed in 2010. The system remained dormant until service began in 2013 while the line owner successfully negotiated with the city of Yongin a minimum revenue guarantee of 29.5 billion KRW per year regardless of passenger load. This is said to be a serious burden for the city because ridership is reported to have risen to only about 20,000 passengers per day on the 30 carriages, or about a quarter of the maximum possible capacity of the fleet in a 12-hour day. A reason suggested for this is the fare of 1100 KRW (about US$1 in 2015); it is impossible to pay for Everline trips via a transfer surcharge on a connecting subway ticket. A 2014 web page of a Seoul tour service retailer makes no mention of the Everline among the suggested modes of bus transport between Seoul and Everland. A lawyer who filed legal action on behalf of the citizens of Yongin is reported to have provided details about Bombardier's pursuit of the contract. He said that \"between 2003 and 2005, Bombardier funded three luxurious trips to Canada to each of 37 people\" including 18 Yongin city councillors on so-called \"LRT field trips\".\nOn 16 October 2015, the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) announced that it has asked its board to consider legal action against Bombardier. TTC staff is recommending that the TTC board \"commence legal action, or make a claim allowed for already in the contract, of $50 million for late delivery\" against Bombardier. Bombardier had committed to delivering 67 custom-built Flexity Outlook streetcars to the TTC by October 2015 for its streetcar system, but only 10 were in service at the time.\n\nOn 28 October 2015, the TTC board voted in favour of a lawsuit against Bombardier \"for at least $50 million to recoup lost costs\", according to Chair Josh Colle, because of the company's failure to deliver the additional new streetcars.\n\n\n"}

He was an early member in the SS, and served with the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler and at the Dachau concentration camp in 1930s. During World War II, Deisenhofer served with several combat divisions on both the Eastern and Western fronts, earning the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. He held a PhD in political economy.\n\nDeisenhofer received his PhD as a political economist. During his time at university, he had come into contact with the Nazi Party, and soon applied to join the SA. A few months with the SA, Deisenhofer transferred to the SS, beginning his service on 1 October 1930. Deisenhofer held various low level command positions, including service with the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler in 1934 and at the Dachau concentration camp in 1935. Over the next two years he served in both the Totenkopfverbände units \"SS Totenkopf Verbande Sachsen\" and \"SS Totenkopf Standarte Thuringen\".\n\nAt the outbreak of war Deisenhofer served in the SS Totenkopf Standarte, which was responsible for the police and security measures during the Invasion of Poland. After the Polish campaign, his unit was absorbed into the newly formed SS Division Totenkopf, where he served as a battalion commander during the Campaign in the West, receiving the Iron Cross First Class for his bravery in combat. In May Deisenhofer was appointed commander of a battalion of the newly formed Dutch and Belgian volunteer formation \"SS Volunteer Standarte Nordwest\".\n\nIn August 1941, Deisenhofer was transferred to the command of the Regiment \"Germania\", one of the Infantry regiments of the SS Division Wiking, currently serving on the Eastern Front. Deisenhofer was sent back to the Totenkopf division in February 1942 as a regimental commander. The division was encircled in the Demyansk Pocket, where he commanded a battle group during the breakout, receiving a Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his actions. Deisenhofer then served as an SS training officer. In March 1944, Deisenhofer was sent back to a combat formation, this time to command a regiment of the 10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg, which took part in the operation to relieve the encircled 1st Panzer Army of Generaloberst Hans-Valentin Hube in what was known as the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket.\n\nThe \"Frundsberg\" was sent to the Normandy to attempt to halt the advance of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery's 21st Army Group, currently advancing on Caen. Deisenhofer's unit saw action during Operation Epsom, which resulted in German defeat. In mid July, Deisenhofer was ordered back east to take command of the SS Division Wiking, currently engaged in heavy fighting in the area near Modlin. At the end of August, he took over command of the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division Götz von Berlichingen. Near the end of January, Deisenhofer disappeared when traveling to a new command post. He was classified as missing in action.\n\n\n\n"}

The first incarnation was in 1905 when Alberta first became a province. Lethbridge covered a large patch of southern Alberta, It was broken into Lethbridge District and Lethbridge City in 1909. After Lethbridge District was broken up into Taber and Little Bow in 1913, Lethbridge City was all that remained, using the Lethbridge name; in 1921 Lethbridge was reformed after City was dropped from the name. In 1971 Lethbridge was split into two districts: Lethbridge-East and Lethbridge-West.\n\nThe riding was named after the Southern Alberta city of Lethbridge.\n\nDistrict results from the first province wide plebiscite on electricity regulation.\n\nOn October 30, 1957 a stand-alone plebiscite was held province wide in all 50 of the then current provincial electoral districts in Alberta. The government decided to consult Alberta voters to decide on liquor sales and mixed drinking after a divisive debate in the Legislature. The plebiscite was intended to deal with the growing demand for reforming antiquated liquor control laws.\n\nThe plebiscite was conducted in two parts. Question A asked in all districts, asked the voters if the sale of liquor should be expanded in Alberta, while Question B asked in a handful of districts within the corporate limits of Calgary and Edmonton asked if men and woman were allowed to drink together in establishments.\n\nProvince wide Question A of the plebiscite passed in 33 of the 50 districts while Question B passed in all five districts. Lethbridge and Wetaskiwin were the only cities in Alberta to vote against the proposal. It was defeated by the narrowest margins with polls showing a clear split between the north and south sections of the city. The voter turnout in the district was well above the province wide average of 46% with well over half the electors turning out to vote.\n\nOfficial district returns were released to the public on December 31, 1957. The Social Credit government in power at the time did not considered the results binding. However the results of the vote led the government to repeal all existing liquor legislation and introduce an entirely new \"Liquor Act\".\n\nMunicipal districts lying inside electoral districts that voted against the Plebiscite such as Lethbridge were designated Local Option Zones by the Alberta Liquor Control Board and considered effective dry zones, business owners that wanted a license had to petition for a binding municipal plebiscite in order to be granted a license.\n\n"}

{"id": "1961883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1961883", "title": "Eucatastrophe", "text": "Eucatastrophe\n\nA eucatastrophe is a sudden turn of events at the end of a story which ensures that the protagonist does not meet some terrible, impending, and very plausible and probable doom. The writer J. R. R. Tolkien coined the word by affixing the Greek prefix \"eu\", meaning \"good\", to \"catastrophe\", the word traditionally used in classically inspired literary criticism to refer to the \"unraveling\" or conclusion of a drama's plot. For Tolkien, the term appears to have had a thematic meaning that went beyond its literal etymological meaning in terms of form. In his definition as outlined in his 1947 essay \"On Fairy-Stories\", eucatastrophe is a fundamental part of his conception of mythopoeia. Though Tolkien's interest is in myth, it is also connected to the gospel; Tolkien calls the Incarnation of Christ the eucatastrophe of \"human history\" and the Resurrection the eucatastrophe of the Incarnation.\n\nEucatastrophe has been labelled by some as a form of \"deus ex machina\", due to both sharing an impossible problem being suddenly resolved. However, differences between the two have also been noted, such as its inherent connection to an optimistic view on the unfolding of events in the narrative of the world. In Tolkien's view, eucatastrophe can also occur without the use of a \"deus ex machina\".\n\nThe best-known and most fully realized eucatastrophe in Tolkien's work occurs in the climax of \"The Lord of the Rings\". Though victory seems assured for Sauron, the One Ring is permanently destroyed as a result of Gollum's waylaying of Frodo at Mount Doom. Frodo essentially fails his impossible quest at its very end, claiming the Ring for himself – however, at this moment, Gollum suddenly appears, steals the ring, and in his ecstatic gloating falls into the fire. If not for Frodo's previous mercy in sparing Gollum's life (a great risk due to Gollum's obvious treachery, met with bitter protest by Sam), and if not for the Ring’s own corruptive influence on Gollum, Sauron would surely have reclaimed it. Thus, Evil is inadvertently and unforeseeably defeated through a small act of kindness and through its own corruptive machinations.\n\nAnother example of eucatastrophe is the recurring role of the eagles as unexpected rescuers throughout Tolkien's writing. Tolkien described Bilbo's \"'eucatastrophic emotion\" at the eagles' appearance in \"The Hobbit\" as one of the key moments of the book.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1961885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1961885", "title": "Atlantic Starr", "text": "Atlantic Starr\n\nAtlantic Starr is an American band based in White Plains, New York. They are best known for the hits \"Always\", \"Secret Lovers\", \"Send for Me\", \"Circles\", \"Silver Shadow\" and \"Masterpiece\".\n\nAtlantic Starr began in Greenburgh, New York with trumpeter Duke Jones (who left the band prior to their first recordings), drummer Porter Carroll Jr., bassist Clifford Archer, percussionist and flautist Joseph Phillips, Sheldon Tucker (Guitar; parted ways with the band before the first recordings), and three brothers: David Lewis (vocals/guitar), Wayne Lewis (keyboards and vocals), and Jonathan Lewis (percussion and trombone). The band's membership eventually stabilized around Carroll, Archer, Phillips, the three Lewis brothers, lead singer Sharon Bryant (who was later replaced by Barbara Weathers), trumpeter William Sudderth III, and saxophonist Damon Rentie (who was later replaced by Koran Daniels). In 1977, the band came to Westwood, California and performed on the nightclub scene under the name \"Newban,\" which they agreed to change at the request of A&M Records executive Herb Alpert when they were signed. Having already agreed to keep the Starr part of an early idea for a new band name, the members decided to add the word Atlantic, because of their East Coast roots. The nine-member band were now A&M employees.\n\nThroughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, Atlantic Starr scored several hits on the R&B charts. However, significant crossover success (onto the pop charts) did not come until halfway into the 1980s, with the release of their album \"As the Band Turns\" (their last on A&M Records), and the single \"Secret Lovers\". By this time, the band had pared itself down to a quintet, consisting of the three Lewis brothers, Phillips, and Weathers. In 1987 (after signing to Warner Bros. Records), the band solidified their pop success by scoring a #1 pop (and R&B) hit with \"Always\", a love ballad off their album \"All in the Name of Love\". Following this success, Weathers left for a solo career, and she was replaced by Porscha Martin for the band's next album, 1988's \"We're Movin' Up\". Although this album was not quite as successful as its predecessors, it did produce another #1 R&B hit with \"My First Love.\"\n\nThe band continued to score hits on both the R&B and Pop charts into the early 1990s. 1991 saw the introduction of yet another new female lead singer, when Martin was replaced by Miss Black America 1986 Rachel Oliver, for the album, \"Love Crazy\". This album featured the band's biggest hit of the 1990s, with \"Masterpiece\" reaching #3 on both the pop and R&B charts in early 1992. The group toured to Japan in 1992 with yet another female vocalist at the helm, Crystal Blake, a studio vocalist for Stevie Wonder who had also sung the female lead parts on the minor hit title track for Eddie Murphy's \"How Could It Be\" album and Young MC's \"Bust a Move.\"\n\nFollowing the release of \"Love Crazy\", Atlantic Starr's relationship with Warner Bros. Records dissolved, and in 1994, the band recorded one album for Arista: \"Time\". That album was a commercial disappointment and the single \"I'll Remember You\" only made it to the fifties on Billboard's R&B and pop singles charts. \"Time\" (which was David Lewis' last album with the band) found a fifth female singer, Aisha Tanner, replacing Oliver. And when 1999's \"Legacy\" was distributed by the small, independent Street Solid label, Atlantic Starr unveiled yet another lineup—one that consisted of two Lewis Brothers (Wayne and Jonathan) as well as Oliver (who had returned and replaced Tanner) and a new male singer named DeWayne Woods. Although \"Legacy\" received little attention, Atlantic Starr still continues to perform today and released their 14th album, \"Metamorphosis\" in 2017, featuring L'john Epps and Melessa Pierce.\n\nAfter leaving Atlantic Starr, original drummer and founding bandmember Porter Carroll, Jr. released a self-titled solo album (\"Porter Carroll II\") in 1986. This album featured contributions from several prominent musicians, including Marcus Miller, David Sanborn, and former Starr bandmate Sharon Bryant. He has continued to do session work since that time, and is currently playing percussion in Daryl Hall's live band.\n\nFollowing her exit from Atlantic Starr, singer Bryant embarked on a solo career and released an album in 1989, scoring several big hits on the R&B charts, as well as a minor Pop hit from the project.\n\nOriginal saxophonist Damon Rentie went on to a solo career of his own, releasing his first solo album, \"Designated Hitter\" in 1985. His second and third solo albums followed in each successive year (1986 and 1987, respectively). He had also previously done session work with DeBarge.\n\nOriginal trumpeter William Sudderth continues to follow an active schedule in the music business, performing in many diverse settings and having become one of the most sought-after horn players in the industry.\n\nBassist Clifford Archer currently resides in Tokyo, Japan where he performs regularly as a musician and session player. Original member Albert \"Duke\" Jones remains involved in the music industry. Joseph Phillips, original percussionist and flautist is currently working with the Reverend Bryan Oakley, producing gospel music.\n\nIn April 1992, Atlantic Starr appeared as themselves on an episode of the daytime soap opera \"Another World\". They sang at local nightspot Sassy's during the episode.\n\n\n"}

Before the extension opens, Sydney Trains will no longer serve stations between this station and Sydenham to the east, so that the nine intermediate stations can be converted for driverless Metro operation. Sydney Trains will continue to run services between Bankstown station and the Main Southern railway line to the west.\n\nAs part of the project, Bankstown station will be upgraded to have an additional at-grade station entrance at the eastern end of the existing platforms, which will align with The Appian Way and Restwell Street. The new entrance will also provide access to Sydney Metro platforms, which will be built east of the new entrance over the road connection between North and South Terraces. The existing station entrance will be retained and the existing platforms is proposed to be retained and extended westwards.\n\nTraditionally, services operated in a loop from the city via Sydenham to Bankstown, then on to Lidcombe, returning to the city via Strathfield and the Main Suburban line and vice versa. In more recent years alternate trains on the line were extended to Liverpool station. For a while, direct services operated to Blacktown via a loop connection to the Main Western line near Lidcombe.\n\nCurrently services operate to Lidcombe and Liverpool on an alternate basis.

It was founded in 1953, and was named for the Laboratory's second director (1945-1970), Norris E. Bradbury. Among the museum's early exhibits, artifacts and documents from World War II Manhattan Project were displayed upon declassification. Other exhibits include full-size models of the Little Boy and Fat Man atomic bombs. Admission is free.\n\nIn 1953, Robert Krohn, who was in charge of early nuclear tests at what was then called Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, decided the Laboratory needed a museum to house historical weapons-research artifacts. Krohn convinced Norris Bradbury (Laboratory director, 1945-1970) a museum could preserve the Laboratory's history and provide a place for official visitors to learn about the Laboratory's weapon programs.\n\nAn old ice house on the bank of Ashley Pond across from Fuller Lodge became the first Laboratory museum. Already fitted with a vault door, the ice house satisfied security standards for housing the classified exhibits Krohn wanted to preserve. The ice house Museum opened to official visitors in 1954.\n\nIn 1963, Robert Porton, director of community relations at the Laboratory, expressed an interest in adding unclassified exhibits to the Museum.\n\nBradbury approved the transfer of unclassified exhibits to an area open to the public, and soon World War II-era documents and photographs, tracing the development of the town and the Laboratory, were displayed with scientific memorabilia and working models of unclassified research projects. In its first year, 14,000 visitors from 50 states and 40 countries visited the Museum.\n\nIn 1965, the Museum was moved to larger quarters. The range and number of exhibits grew rapidly and included many hands-on models contributed by scientific groups and divisions within the Laboratory.\n\nIn 1970, the museum was renamed the Norris E. Bradbury Science Museum, honoring the laboratory's second director. Eventually, the museum's official name was shortened to the Bradbury Science Museum. Major renovations to the Museum took place in 1981. Informal, donated exhibits gave way to professionally designed exhibits in a formal museum atmosphere. Videotapes, videodisks, and interactive computer programs were introduced. New artifacts included a Mark 12A warhead, models of Vela and Navistar verification and communication satellites, and an air-launched cruise missile.\n\nBy 1987, annual attendance had reached 80,000, and parking space for visitors was disappearing. Laboratory officials began exploring options for relocating the Museum site. In April 1993, the Museum moved into its new and present location in the heart of downtown Los Alamos. The building was designed by William Agnew and Associates and is leased by the Laboratory from a private owner.\n\nApproximately 40 interactive exhibits trace the history of the World War II Manhattan Project, highlight the Laboratory's current and historic research projects related to defense and technology, and focus on Laboratory research related to national security, nuclear weapons stockpile stewardship, and other fields. Recent additions to the museum's collections are exhibits about the history of supercomputers, the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center, Los Alamos' contributions to the Mars Science Laboratory (\"Curiosity\" rover), nanotechnology, algae biofuels, and high explosives.\n\n"}

Upon reaching the island, Maconochie immediately instituted policies that restored dignity to prisoners, achieving remarkable success in prisoner rehabilitation. These policies were well in advance of their time and Maconochie was politically undermined. His ideas would be largely ignored and forgotten, only to be readopted as the basis of modern penal systems over a century later in the mid- to late 20th century.\n\nMaconochie was born in Edinburgh on 11 February 1787. At the age of 9, his father died and he was raised by Allan Maconochie, later Lord Meadowbank.\n\nHe joined the Royal Navy in 1803 and as a midshipman saw active service in the Napoleonic Wars, rising to the rank of Lieutenant. In 1811 he was serving on the Brig HMS Grasshopper, which shipwrecked Christmas Eve off the coast of the Dutch Coast. He, together with all those on board, were taken as a prisoner of war and extradited to the French. The forced march in the winter-bitter-cold of Holland to Verdun and more than two years of miserable imprisonment gave him an experience that he used later in his penal reform. He was released upon Napoleon's abdication in 1814. He returned to active service in the British-American War where he commanded HMS Calliope. In 1815, he was promoted to the rank of Commander.\n\nIn the peace following the final defeat of Napoleon, Maconochie spent 13 years in Edinburgh studying geography and geopolitics. At this time he wrote extensively on steam navigation and the colonisation of the Pacific. He married in 1822. In 1828 he moved to London, England where he was a founder and first secretary of the Royal Geographical Society in 1830. In 1833 he became the first professor of Geography at the University College London, and was a knight of the Royal Guelphic Order.\n\nIn 1836 he sailed to the convict settlement at Hobart in Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) as private secretary to the Lieutenant-Governor Sir John Franklin. Here he wrote a report strongly critical of the state of \"prison discipline\". The convict system, being fixated on punishment alone, released back into society crushed, resentful and bitter expirees, in whom the spark of enterprise and hope was dead. Maconochie's report “can be said to mark the peak and incipient decline of transportation to Australia” when it was given to Lord Russell, the Home Secretary and ardent critic of transportation, claims Robert Hughes. Although this report was used by the Molesworth Committee on transportation in 1837-38, the criticism of this work forced Franklin to dismiss him.\n\nAccording to his biographer John Barry, Maconochie “was a deeply religious man, of generous and compassionate temperament, and convinced of the dignity of man.” His two basic principles of penology were that:\n\nFollowing the Molesworth committee's report, transportation to New South Wales was abolished in 1840, although it continued to other colonies. Disturbed at reports of conditions on Norfolk Island, Lord Normanby, Secretary of State for the Colonies, suggested that a new system should be used, and the superintendence given to an officer deeply concerned with the moral welfare of the convicts. Maconochie was recommended to put this new system in place.\n\nIn March 1840 he took up duties as commandant of the penal settlement at Norfolk Island and applied his penal principles. Convicts were awarded 'marks' to encourage effort and thrift. Sentences were served in stages, each increasing in responsibility. Cruel punishments and degrading conditions were reduced, and convicts' sense of dignity was respected. Perhaps the fact that he has experienced the life of a prisoner himself, played a part in his approach to his task. He was the only commandant with such an experience.\n\nThese views contrasted greatly with the cruel conditions that had existed on Norfolk Island prior to Maconochie's arrival. He was not permitted to apply his principles to the 1,200 hardened twice-sentenced convicts, but only to the 600 newcomers sent directly from the United Kingdom and who were separated from the 'Old Hands'. His 'mark' system was not permitted to reduce a convict's sentence, and it was difficult to find other incentives. His reforms were resisted by military guards, supervisors and constables (many of whom were ex-convicts) at his command. In particular, his deputy held views opposite to his own. In an exclusively male environment, he found he was unable to reduce the 'unnatural offence' of sodomy which was prevalent and which he continued to punish by flogging. Criticism of his methods in Sydney and England led Governor Sir George Gipps to visit the island in 1843. He was favourably impressed with the condition of the convicts and the effectiveness of the 'marks' system, and reported that Maconochie's System of Moral Reform could work if carried through to its conclusion. However the order had already been given in the United Kingdom for Maconochie to be replaced. Under the commandants who followed him, Norfolk Island reverted to being an object of terror under brutal masters.\n\nAlmost 1,400 convicts had been discharged during Maconochie's term, and he always claimed that a high percentage did not offend again. He is known as the \"Father of Parole\".\n\nMaconochie returned to the UK in 1844 and two years later published a book outlining his system. This had an immense influence on the development of penology. In 1849 he was appointed governor of the new prison at Birmingham, but was dismissed and criticised for his actions, in spite of being praised for his humanity and benevolence.\n\nHe died on 25 October 1860 at Morden in Surrey, still campaigning for penal reform in spite of ill-health. He was buried at St Lawrence Church, London Road, Morden, Surrey. His grave can still be seen in the Churchyard.\n\nJohn Barry states that “Maconochie was a pioneer in penal reform, and suffered the fate of men in advance of their times. His concepts and many of his practical measures are now the basis of Western penal systems.”\n\nThe Alexander Maconochie Centre, a prison in Canberra, is named in his honour.\n\nSir Walter Frederick Crofton (1815–1897) introduced a variant of the ‘progressive stages’ system of penal discipline into the Irish convict prisons.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1961924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1961924", "title": "Dean (Christianity)", "text": "Dean (Christianity)\n\nA dean, in a church context, is a cleric holding certain positions of authority within a religious hierarchy. The title is used mainly in the Anglican Communion, the Roman Catholic Church, and many Lutheran denominations. A dean's assistant is called a subdean.\n\nLatin \"decanus\" in the Roman military was the head of a group of ten soldiers within a \"centuria\", and by the 5th century CE, it was the head of a group of ten monks. It came to refer to various civil functionaries in the later Roman Empire.\n\nBased on the monastic use, it came to mean the head of a chapter of canons of a collegiate church or cathedral church.\n\nBased on that use, deans in universities now fill various administrative positions.\n\nLatin \"decanus\" should not be confused with Greek \"diákonos\" (διάκονος),' from which the word deacon derives, which describes a supportive role.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, the Dean of the College of Cardinals and the Cardinal Vice-Dean are the president and vice-president of the college. Both are elected. Except for presiding and delegating administrative tasks, they have no authority over the cardinals, acting as \"primus inter pares\" (first among equals).\n\nIn the universities that grew out of the cathedral and monastery schools, a university dean came to be an official with various administrative duties.\n\nIn the Church of England and elsewhere in the Anglican Communion, the dean is the chief resident cleric of a cathedral or other collegiate church and the head of the chapter of canons. If the cathedral or collegiate church has its own parish, the dean is usually also rector of the parish. However, in the Church of Ireland the roles are often separated, and most cathedrals in the Church of England do not have associated parishes. In the Church in Wales, however, most cathedrals are parish churches, and their deans are now also vicars of their parishes.\n\nIn some parts of the Communion (particularly in the Scottish Episcopal Church and, formerly in some cathedrals in England), the senior resident cleric in a cathedral is a provost. Each diocese of the Scottish Episcopal Church has a \"dean of the diocese\": this is a cleric who, rather than heading the cathedral staff, assists the bishop in the administration of the diocese. In this way, a Scottish Episcopal dean is similar to an archdeacon in the other member churches of the Communion (a post that does not exist in the Scottish church). In the Anglican Church of Canada, the roles of senior cleric of the cathedral are combined in one person who is referred to as \"Rector of Cathedral and Dean of Diocese\". Thus, Peter Elliott is Rector of Christ Church Cathedral and Dean of New Westminster.\n\nThe style \"The Very Reverend\" distinguishes a cleric as a dean (or a cathedral provost). For example, the Very Reverend June Osborne was Dean of Salisbury Cathedral. The legal act by which a cathedral dean in the Church of England takes up his or her role is the \"institution\", which is invariably followed in the same service by the installation (into his/her \"stall\" in the cathedral church); an \"institution and installation\" are very often referred to simply as an installation. In consideration of the high status of a Dean, the Very Reverend title is normally a permanent title preferment.\n\nSome important deans include the deans of St Paul's, Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey. Westminster Abbey is a royal peculiar, not the seat of any bishop or a cathedral, but is led by a dean. The deans of Washington National Cathedral and St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin are likewise important clerics in their churches.\n\nIn many parts of the Anglican Communion, parishes are grouped together to form deaneries, each being a constituent administrative district of the diocese. Usually, a deanery is led by one of the incumbents of the deanery's parishes, who is called a \"rural dean\", but in more urban areas this has often been replaced by the title \"area dean\" or \"regional dean\". Such a dean chairs the meeting of the deanery's clergy (which, like a cathedral, is called a chapter), and may also chair a deanery synod. Rural Deans (and those known by alternative titles) rank as primi inter pares of their chapters, and do not have the seniority of cathedral or diocesan deans.\n\nThe head of an Anglican theological college or seminary may also be called a dean (in common with its use in education).\n\nThe title \"dean\" is conferred upon a pastor of a parish who serves as a senior figure, though usually without specific jurisdictional authority, over a section of a diocese. These are sometimes referred to as \"rural deans\", and are expected to show a degree of leadership among the pastors of the region, known as a deanery. This function is sometimes titled \"vicar forane\". An episcopal vicar serves a similar function, but has more formal authority and specific powers under canon law.\n\nIn recent years, the Catholic Church in England and Wales has introduced the custom of designating cathedral deans, formerly known as cathedral administrators. However, the term differs slightly from the Anglican usage as Catholic deans do not necessarily preside over the cathedral chapter (this function belonging to the office of Provost), and are not necessarily required even to be a member of the chapter. More commonly, in places throughout the world where a cathedral chapter has not been erected (as for instance, in the United States, where there are no chapters at all), the term rector is used for the priest who serves as chief administrator of a cathedral church.\n\nAnother important use of the term within the Catholic Church is in the office of the Dean of the College of Cardinals, who serves as senior member of that body. The current dean is Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, approved on 18 January 2020.\n\nWithin the Lutheran tradition, particularly in the Nordic and Baltic tradition of evangelical episcopal Lutheranism, senior clergy bear the title 'Dean'. Each diocese usually has a cathedral Dean, in charge of the cathedral church, and a series of area deans to supervise the clergy in a given geographical area. In the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, there are also deans in charge of leading the administrative work and personnel of the Chapters.\n\nUnited Methodist Christians often speak of a \"dean\" in terms of the dean of the cabinet. Every annual conference has a bishop's cabinet made up of the district superintendents under the bishop's appointment, as well as occasionally a few other conference officials. One of these superintendents is chosen by his or her colleagues to serve as the dean, usually for one year. This dean then has certain administrative and leadership responsibilities, and is accountable to the bishop.\n\nIn various other religious denominations, the title \"dean\" may be used informally in its wider sense of a senior or venerated member of a congregation. The title may also used in its academic sense in parochial schools.\n"}

The lake basin, which formed at the efflux of the Nepean River from the Hawkesbury Sandstone (Sydney sandstone) gorge, is a popular swimming hole with a camping area and an education centre used by local school groups. Also featuring a large woodland area and native wildlife, the reserve is the only picnic area along the Nepean River and it is one of the most popular water-based picnic parks in Greater Western Sydney. \n\nAboriginal Australians were denizens of the area due to its vicinity to the Nepean River, which featured food and water. The Basin is believed to have been a traditional meeting and trading place between Aboriginal groups. Having spiritual and cultural significance to Aboriginal communities, camps were used to provide an opportunity for Aboriginal people to connect with each other and their culture.\n\nBents Basin was discovered in 1804 by the botanist George Caley, who named it 'Dovedale', where it has since then been a popular place for botanists. The site was originally a small natural basin formed in an erosion basin banked by sandstone outcrops, considerably enlarged with a large earth fill dam constructed by the Army's 17th Construction Squadron in 1987–88. \n\nA prominent inn was located within the park and is listed on the \"NSW State Heritage Inventory\". The inn was built in the 1860s and the site is of local importance, as it gives details of western Sydney's history, early road networks and the rise and fall of rural communities in the region. Destroyed in the 1950s, the inn's location is marked by a pepper tree (Schinus areira). The Basin was reserved as State Recreation Area in 1994.\n\nThe Basin features a floodplain and is on a plateau. The basin is a circular lagoon-like pool that is across and over at its deepest, travelling about northeast (through Hawkesbury River) before reaching the ocean in Central Coast. Bents Basin is around 36km south of Penrith and 56km south-west of Sydney central business district. To the east of the basin is a cleared undulating paddock on the clay soils from the Wianamatta Shale of the Cumberland Plain. \n\nThe Basin adjoins \"Gulguer Nature Reserve\" to the south. Two small creeks exist in the area. Large parts of the reserve are prone to flood. During flood events the basin is either fully closed or partially closed to all water-based activity because of hazardous conditions.\n\nAnimals species within the area include the Common bent-wing bat, sooty owl, Common wombat, East-coast free-tailed bat, powerful owl, large-eared pied bat and the glossy black cockatoo. The basin harbours 25 plant communities and around 360 plant species. Hibbertia hermanniifolia and Eucalyptus benthamii are both rare tree species present in the park. \n\nOther plant species include, Angophora subvelutina, Eucalyptus pilularis, Eucalyptus eugenioides, Acacia parramattensis, Backhousia myrtifolia, Pratia purpurascens. Asplenium flabellifolium, Adiantum aethiopicum, Oplismenus imbecillis, Cynodon dactylon, Tristaniopsis laurina, Casuarina cunninghamiana, Microlaena stipoides, Syncarpia glomulifera, Glochidion ferdinandi and Ceratopetalum apetalum.\n\nThe park is popular for swimming, kayaking, bushwalking, camping (with 100 tent sites), barbecuing, picnicking and fishing. The park also features walking trails within a bushland and an education centre with a commercial kitchen. \"Caley's Lookout Track\", a walking track within the bushland, leads to \"Little Mountain\", a scenic lookout area that is in elevation. Designated facilities can be hired for personal use. Two roads access the park (Bents Basin Road in northwest and Bents Loop Road in the park's east), though only the eastern approach permits access to the camping grounds and education centre. A fee is charged for vehicle access per day.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1961945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1961945", "title": "Uncle Tobys", "text": "Uncle Tobys\n\nUncle Tobys is an Australian food manufacturing company which specialises in breakfast oat products. Since its foundation in 1861, the company has expanded its product range across the cereal and ready-to-eat snack market. Uncle Tobys is currently operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Nestlé, after being acquired in 2006 (Nestlé, 2006). Uncle Tobys’ main factory is situated in the town of Wahgunyah, Victoria.\n\nDuring the gold rush in Victoria, brothers Leonard and George Parsons left England and began manufacturing John Bull Oats in Melbourne. In 1861 they established Parsons Bros. which later became Uncle Tobys. Rolled oats were considered a commodity during the era and were mentioned in the financial columns of newspapers.\n\nThe Uncle Tobys product suite is separated into three categories: Snacks, Oats and Cereals. The company sells different types of oats, such as traditional, super blend, and ancient grains.\n\nOther popular Uncle Tobys products include: Roll-ups, Cheerios, and snack bars.\n\n80% of the oats used by Uncle Tobys Australia are of the Mikita variety. Mikita oats differ from conventional oats due to higher levels of disease resistance, increased yield potential, and increased levels of β-glucan. Mikita oats were developed at the South Australian Research Development Institute (SARDI), by the National Oat Breeding Program. The research was funded by the Uncle Tobys Corporation, in partnership with various governmental and corporate entities.\n\nUncle Tobys sources 50% of its oats from local farms, which are within 100km its main factory. In its corporate supply chain, Uncle Tobys exclusively utilises suppliers who have been certified as “Level A” by the National Association of Sustainable Agriculture.\n\nUncle Tobys often advertises the health benefits of its oats, calling them a ‘natural superfood’. Monro et al (2003) conducted research on three of Uncle Tobys oat bars (Break-Free Fruesli, Whole meal Fruit, and Chewy Muesli). The study found that: “Dietary Fibre contents are consistent with recommendations for adult males made by the Standing Committee on the Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes of the Food and Nutrition Board”.\n\nOn the 23 of May 2006, Nestlé announced its acquisition of Uncle Tobys Australia—in addition to the brand rights in New Zealand—for the total sum of $890 million Australian dollars. This buyout occurred at a valuation of 11.3 times the 2005 EBITDA, which was roughly 79 million AUD.\n\nThe Uncle Tobys cereal business—which accounted for approximately 40% of its overall sales—was bought by Cereal Partners Worldwide (a joint venture between and General Mills and Nestlé). Other sections of the Uncle Tobys business, such as nutritious snacks and instant soups, were directly incorporated into Nestlé Australia.\n\nPrior to this merger, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) published an analysis of the potential market impacts. In their competition analysis, it was determined that “the acquisition would be unlikely to substantially lessen competition in markets for nutritious snacks and breakfast cereals”. Following this analysis, authorisation was granted for the corporate acquisition.\n\nOn the 13 of September 2006, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission mandated that Uncle Tobys stop advertising that its fruit roll-ups are ‘Made with 65% real fruit’. The chairman of the commission released a statement saying; “The ACCC was concerned that the Roll-Ups composition was being misrepresented to consumers”. After the announcement, Uncle Tobys altered its advertising practices to remove the aforementioned phrase. Uncle Tobys was prevented from suggesting that Roll-Ups are equivalent to any percentage of fresh fruit and was prevented from running an advertisement that showed an apple being compacted into a fruit Roll-up.\n\nAfter the mandate, the ACCC required Uncle Tobys to publish an article for the food industry, emphasising the importance of advertising standards. In the article, Uncle Tobys states: “The Key learning from this experience was that in making representations to consumers, we have to carefully consider how consumers might view both representations on packaging and the overall impression created by all the aspects of product marketing, including labels, branding and advertising”.\n\nOn the 26 of November 2015, Cereal Partners Australia paid a fine of $32,400 to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Prior to this payment, the ACCC had issued Cereal Partners Australia with three infringement notices. The commission issued infringement notices because it had reason to believe that Cereal Partners Australia had violated Australian Consumer Law, by misrepresenting the protein content within Uncle Tobys oat products. The commission alleged that the packaging “made false or misleading representations that the oats in these Uncle Tobys products contained a significant amount of protein, which is not the case”. Uncle Tobys had included a disclaimer with the packaging, but this did not impact the verdict.\n\nHistorically, the Uncle Tobys brand has been closely associated with swimming. In 1983, the company sponsored its first athlete—Lisa Curry—a swimmer at the commonwealth games. Currently, Uncle Tobys has two brand ambassadors: Olympic Champions Cate and Bronte Campbell.\n\nUncle Tobys, in collaboration with Royal Life Saving Australia, previously launched a swimming campaign. The program is named ‘Swim My Way’ and was launched on the 6 of March 2018. The aim of this program is to promote swimming to all Australians, regardless of their age demographic.\n\nOn the 10 of January 2020, Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) issued a product recall for a number of Uncle Tobys products. The recall affected four flavours of fruit roll-ups; including passionfruit, rainbow berry, rainbow fruit salad, and fun-prints strawberry (Food Standards Australia New Zealand, 2020).\n\nThe product recall was due to equipment failure within one of Nestle’s production facilities, which created the possibility for there to be foreign matter (small metal fragments) in the product. Customers who purchased the recalled batches were entitled to a full refund.\n"}

Damerei is believed to have died of the plague during infancy.\n\nWeir states that Queen Elizabeth first became aware in May 1592 of the secret marriage and of Damerei's birth, despite Bess and Sir Walter's denials. The couple had married without royal permission, but, significantly, Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, was in on the secret and acting as godfather to the Raleighs' son. Once the queen found out, she first placed Bess and Raleigh under house arrest, then sent them to the Tower of London, in June 1592. Raleigh was released from the Tower in August 1592 and Bess in December 1592, at which time she joined her husband at Sherborne Castle, his Dorset estate. Elizabeth expected the couple to sue for pardon, but they refused to, and Raleigh remained out of favour for five years.\n\nThe couple remained devoted to each other, although, according to Weir, Bess proved to be a domineering wife. Anna Beer, Lady Raleigh's biographer, offers a different perspective, pointing out that due to Raleigh's frequent absences, whether on expeditions, diplomatic duties, or in prison, Bess had to shoulder an unusual level of responsibility for a woman of her time. \n\nThe Raleighs’ second son, Walter, was born in 1593 at Sherborne. The couple's third son was born in January 1605, by which time Raleigh was again a prisoner in the Tower of London. Named Carew, which was both Bess' mother's maiden name and the name of one of Raleigh's brothers, he was christened within the walls of the Tower in the church of St Peter ad Vincula. After Raleigh's execution in 1618, Bess worked tirelessly to re-establish her late husband's reputation and, in 1628, saw a Bill of Restitution restore the Raleigh name 'in blood', which allowed her one surviving son to inherit.\n\nBess is said to have had her husband's head embalmed and to have carried it around with her for the rest of her life, although the only documented reference to Raleigh's head is from the day of his execution, when it was noted that Lady Raleigh and her ladies left the scene carrying Sir Walter's head in a red bag. An account from 1740 claims that, after Bess' death, Raleigh's head was returned to his tomb in St Margaret's, Westminster. However, even if this were true, it remains unclear where Raleigh's body was buried: it may have been released to Bess, as per her request, or even sent to Exeter, where his parents were buried.\n\nThrough both her parents, Bess had connections to Henry VIII. Her father, Nicholas Throckmorton, was the cousin of Henry's sixth wife, Queen Catherine Parr. Anne Carew, Elizabeth's mother, was the daughter of Nicholas Carew and Elizabeth Carew née Bryan. Nicholas had been a close friend of Henry's, from childhood until his execution in 1539. \n\nIn her aforementioned book, Weir alleges that Elizabeth Carew had earlier been Henry VIII's mistress, and that he had given her jewels that should technically have belonged to the queen when the queen gave birth to her son. However, there exist no contemporaneous references to a possibility that any of Elizabeth's children were fathered by Henry.\n\nBessie Throckmorton is a major character in Edward German's operetta \"Merrie England\" (1902).\n\nIn the film \"The Virgin Queen\" (1955), Elizabeth Throckmorton (referred to as Beth Throgmorton in the film) is portrayed by Joan Collins, Queen Elizabeth by Bette Davis.\n\nElizabeth Throckmorton is the subject of Rosemary Sutcliff's novel \"Lady in Waiting\" (1956). Sutcliff usually refers to her as \"Bess\".\n\nShe is mentioned in Elizabeth Goudge's \"Towers in the mist\" (1936), set in Oxford in 1566, also as Bess. This is anachronistic as she would have been only an infant at the time. \n\nShe appears briefly in \"A Dead Man in Deptford\" (1993), Anthony Burgess' speculative fictional account of the life of playwright Christopher Marlowe.\n\nElizabeth \"Bess\" Throckmorton, portrayed by Abbie Cornish, was a featured character in the film \"\" (2007). This sequel to \"Elizabeth\" (1998) focuses on the relationships of Elizabeth I (Cate Blanchett) and Bess with Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), and shows Bess and Raleigh marrying prior to the Spanish Armada (1588), though in fact the couple married in 1591.\n\nShe appears briefly in Deborah Harkness' novel \"Shadow of Night\" (2012) as Queen Elizabeth's lady-in-waiting and Walter Raleigh's lover.\n\nElizabeth Throckmorton, played by actress Phoebe Thomas, appears in the BBC 2 three-part drama documentary series \"Armada: 12 Days to Save England\" (2015) as lady-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth (Anita Dobson), whom the Queen calls 'Bess'. One scene shows the Queen's jealousy of Bess when she realises, from seeing her wearing a brooch, that Bess has a male admirer unknown to the Queen. Another scene shows the Queen's paranoia about the great danger she feels she is in while the Armada is attacking England, with the Queen forcing Bess to taste her food to check for poison.\n\n"}

Chorley prevented commercial development near the station by placing covenants on the surrounding land, which he owned, and so Cheltenham is one of the few stations in Sydney with no shops nearby.\n\nAs part of the original plans for the North West Rail Link it was proposed to upgrade Cheltenham station to four tracks as part of the quadruplication of the line between Epping and Beecroft. There were however no plans for North West Rail Line services to stop at Cheltenham station. Due to complaints by local residents about noise and increased train services, the proposal to route the line through Cheltenham was scrapped, in favour of a tunnel starting at Epping station from the Epping to Chatswood line.\n\nHowever, a second northbound track was built through the station around a decade later as part of the North Sydney Freight Corridor project, with the western platform becoming an island. The works included the construction of a new concourse with lifts, which opened on 31 August 2015.

Started in the early 1830s near Peachtree Creek, it was run by Hardy Pace, one of the city's founders. It was an important transportation link to northwestern Georgia, especially prior to the construction of the State Road (the Western & Atlantic Railroad) to Chattanooga.\n\nIn Vinings (formerly Paces), Pace's Mill was a gristmill begun by Hardy Pace, founded to diversify his holdings after the railroad was built. The short Paces Mill Road still exists today. Just across the river is Paces, the northwestern-most neighborhood of Atlanta.\n\nDuring the Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War, the Battle of Pace's Ferry was fought July 5, 1864.\n\nThe original Pace's Ferry Road was begun during the Georgia Gold Rush as a stage coach bringing people from Decatur to Vinings, where they could continue on to gold country. The road went southeast from the river to Irbyville (later Irby, now Buckhead), then following what is now called \"Old Decatur Road\", then Cheshire Bridge Road, through what is now Emory University on Clifton Road, along Haygood Drive then North Decatur Road until that hits Clairmont Road, which was then known as the Shallowford Road. \n\nIn modern times, Paces Ferry Road (dropping the apostrophe) is still an important east/west route across northern Atlanta. West Paces Ferry Road runs from the center of Buckhead Village as far west as a dead-end in Paces, while Paces Ferry Road splits off to the northwest at Nancy Creek and runs across the river to Vinings in Cobb County, where it is the address for the world headquarters of The Home Depot. Beginning at Atlanta Road and going east, it crosses I-285 at mile 18, and heads into historic Vinings where it crosses the Chattahoochee River. This river crossing is very near the old ferry location, just down from the 1904 bridge that replaced the ferry. That first wooden bridge had been used for pedestrians since being replaced by a concrete one in the early 1970s.\n\nAt the river, Paces Ferry Road enters Fulton County and the Atlanta city limits and continues to its terminus at the western end of Atlanta's Buckhead area. Here, West Paces Ferry Road continues under I-75 at mile 255, and heads east through some of Atlanta's oldest and wealthiest Buckhead neighborhoods. It serves as the address of the Georgia Governor's Mansion as well many of Atlanta's other stately older mansions and estates. Unlike many of metro Atlanta's newer suburbs, the area along this street has maintained most of its forest cover, also making it a pleasant and scenic drive. It emerges from this canopy at the center of Buckhead, meeting Peachtree Road at the southern end of Roswell Road.\n\nAfter passing Georgia 9 and U.S. 19 (both routed on Peachtree to the south and Roswell to the north), it becomes East Paces Ferry Road. It stops at Piedmont Road (Georgia 237), then continues very slightly northward on the other side as a residential street. The tolled section of the Georgia 400 expressway, finished in 1993, made this a dead-end road in the early 1990s. It resumes on the other side of the tollway, along the southeastern edge of Lenox Square, the city's first indoor shopping mall. The road then ends east-northeast of Lenox Road at Roxboro Road, but is named Railroad Avenue for these last three blocks past Lenox Road and the Lenox MARTA station, immediately northeast of where the north and northeast lines split.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1962025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962025", "title": "Recession 2000s", "text": "Recession 2000s\n\nThe early 2000s recession was a decline in economic activity which mainly occurred in developed countries. The recession affected the European Union during 2000 and 2001 and the United States from March to November 2001. The UK, Canada and Australia avoided the recession, while Russia, a nation that did not experience prosperity during the 1990s, in fact began to recover from said situation. Japan's 1990s recession continued. This recession was predicted by economists, because the boom of the 1990s (accompanied by both low inflation and low unemployment) slowed in some parts of East Asia during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The recession in industrialized countries was not as significant as either of the two previous worldwide recessions. Some economists in the United States object to characterizing it as a recession since there were no two consecutive quarters of negative growth.\n\nAfter the relatively mild 1990 recession ended in early 1991, the country hit a belated unemployment rate peak of 7.8% in mid-1992. Job growth was initially muted by large layoffs among defense related industries. However, payrolls accelerated in 1992 and experienced robust growth through 2000.\n\nPredictions that the bubble would burst emerged during the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. Predictions about a future burst increased following the October 27, 1997 mini-crash, in the wake of the Asian crisis. This caused an uncertain economic climate during the first few months of 1998. However conditions improved, and the Federal Reserve raised interest rates six times between June 1999 and May 2000 in an effort to cool the economy to achieve a soft landing. The burst of the stock market bubble occurred in the form of the NASDAQ crash in March 2000. Growth in gross domestic product slowed considerably in the third quarter of 2000 to the lowest rate since a contraction in the first quarter of 1992.\n\nThe NBER's Business Cycle Dating Committee has determined that a peak in business activity occurred in the U.S. economy in March 2001. A peak marks the end of an expansion and the beginning of a recession. The determination of a peak date in March is thus a determination that the expansion that began in March 1991 ended in March 2001 and a recession began. The expansion lasted exactly 10 years, the longest in the NBER's chronology. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), which is the private, nonprofit, nonpartisan organization charged with determining economic recessions, the U.S. economy was in recession from March 2001 to November 2001, a period of eight months at the beginning of President George W. Bush's term of office. However, economic conditions did not satisfy the common shorthand definition of recession, which is \"a fall of a country's real gross domestic product in two or more successive quarters\", and has led to some confusion about the procedure for determining the starting and ending dates of a recession.\n\nThe NBER's Business Cycle Dating Committee (BCDC) uses monthly, rather than quarterly, indicators to determine peaks and troughs in business activity, as can be seen by noting that starting and ending dates are given by month and year, not quarters. However, controversy over the precise dates of the recession led to the characterization of the recession as the \"Clinton Recession\" by Republicans, if it could be traced to the final term of President Bill Clinton.\nBCDC members suggested they would be open to revisiting the dates of the recession as newer and more definitive data became available. In early 2004, NBER President Martin Feldstein said:\nHowever, the NBER has since confirmed that the recession started in March 2001.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2001, the Federal Reserve, in a move to protect the economy from the overvalued stock market, made successive interest rate increases; while this may have initiated the readjustment, it is starkly contrasted with the severe, prolonged recession that would have occurred had the unsustainable growth continued unabated. Using the stock market as an unofficial benchmark, a recession would have begun in March 2000 when the NASDAQ crashed following the collapse of the dot-com bubble. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was relatively unscathed by the NASDAQ's crash until the September 11, 2001 attacks, after which the DJIA suffered its worst one-day point loss and biggest one-week losses in history up to that point. The market rebounded, only to crash once more in the final two quarters of 2002. In the final three quarters of 2003, the market finally rebounded permanently, agreeing with the unemployment statistics that a recession defined in this way would have lasted from 2001 through 2003.\n\nThe Labor Department estimates that a net 1.735 million jobs were shed in 2001, with an additional net 508,000 lost during 2002. 2003 saw a small gain of a mere 105,000 jobs. Unemployment rose from 4.2% in February 2001 to 5.5% in November 2001, but did not peak until June 2003 at 6.3%, after which it declined to 5% by mid-2005.\n\nCanada's economy is closely linked to that of the United States, and economic conditions south of the border tend to quickly make their way north. Canada's stock markets were especially hard hit by the collapse in high-tech stocks. For much of the 1990s the rapid rise of the TSX had almost wholly been attributed to two stocks: Nortel and BCE. Both companies were hard hit by the downturn, especially Nortel, which was forced to lay off much of its workforce. The events of September 11 also hurt the Canadian stock markets and were especially devastating to the already troubled airline sector.\n\nHowever, in the wider economy, Canada was surprisingly unhurt by these events. While growth slowed, the economy never actually entered a recession. This was the first time that Canada had avoided following the United States into an economic downturn. The rate of job creation in Canada continued at the rapid pace of the 1990s. A number of explanations have been advanced to explain this. Canada was not as directly affected by 9/11 and the subsequent wars, and the downward pressure of these events was more muted. Canada's fiscal management during the period has been praised as the federal government continued to bring in large surpluses throughout this period, in sharp contrast to the United States. Unlike the United States no major tax cuts or major new expenditures were introduced. However, during this time, Canada did pursue an expansionary monetary policy in an effort to reduce the effects of a possible recession. Many provincial governments suffered greater problems with a number of them returning to deficits, which was blamed on the fiscal imbalance. 2003 saw elections in six Canadian provinces and in only one did the governing party not lose seats.\n\nThe Soviet Union's last year of economic growth was 1989, and throughout the 1990s, recession ensued in the Former Soviet Republics. In May 1998, following the 1997 crash of the East Asian economy, things began to get even worse in Russia. In August 1998, the value of the ruble fell 34% and people clamored to get their money out of banks (see 1998 Russian financial crisis). The government acted by dragging its feet on privatization programs. Russians responded to this situation with approval by electing the more pro-dirigist and less liberal Vladimir Putin as President in 2000. Putin proceeded to reassert the role of the federal government, and gave it power it had not seen since the Soviet era. State-run businesses were used to out-compete some of the more wealthy rivals of Putin. Putin's policies were popular with the Russian people, gaining him re-election in 2004. At the same time, the export-oriented Russian economy enjoyed considerable influx of foreign currency thanks to rising worldwide oil prices (from $15 per barrel in early 1999 to an average of $30 per barrel during Putin's first term). The early 2000s recession was avoided in Russia due to rebound in exports and, to some degree, a return to dirigisme.\n\nJapan's recession, which started in the early 1990s, continued into the 2000s, with deflation being the main problem. Deflation began plaguing Japan in the fiscal year ending 1999, and by 2005 the yen had 103% of its 2000 buying power. The Bank of Japan attempted to cultivate inflation with high liquidity and a nominal 0% interest rate on loans. Other aspects of the Japanese economy were good during the early 2000s; unemployment remained relatively low, and China became somewhat dependent on the Japanese exports. The bear market, however, continued in Japan, despite the best efforts of the Bank.\n\nTransition left the economy of the European Union in a cautiously optimistic state during the early 2000s. The most difficult years were 2000–2001, precipitating the worst years of the American recession. The European Union introduced a new currency on January 1, 1999. The euro, which was met with much anticipation, had its value immediately plummet, and it continued to be a weak currency throughout 2000 and 2001. Inflation struck the Eurozone for a few months in summer 2001 but the economy deflated within months. In 2002, the value of the euro began to rapidly rise (reaching parity with the US dollar on July 15, 2002). This hurt business for companies based in Europe, as the profits made abroad (especially in the Americas) had an unfavorable exchange rate.\n\nFrance and Germany both entered recession towards the end of 2001, but in May 2002 both countries declared that their recessions had ended after a mere six months each. Both economies suffered from global tech crash with the ruling German party introducing the then unpopular austerity, tax cuts and labor reforms nicknamed Hartz concept to boost the German economy in wake of an economic slump that would persist until the mid-2000s with unemployment peaking in early 2005 of 12.7%. However, some European Union countries – including the United Kingdom – managed to delay sliding into recession until the late 2000s.\n\n"}

He wrote many of the band's biggest hits, including \"Questions 67 & 68\", \"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\", \"Beginnings\", \"25 or 6 to 4\", \"Saturday in the Park\", \"Dialogue (Part I & II)\" and \"Harry Truman\". Lamm is one of three founding members (alongside James Pankow and Lee Loughnane) still performing with the group.\n\nLamm was born on October 13, 1944, in Brooklyn, New York City. His parents had a collection of jazz records, which were an early influence on him. As a youth, he performed in the boys' and men's choir at Grace Episcopal Church in Brooklyn Heights. In a 2003 interview, Lamm said, \"My first musical training came as a member of that choir. It exposed me to some of the great sacred music from the Middle Ages, right up through Bach and into the 20th Century composers.\"\n\nHis mother eventually remarried, resulting in Lamm moving to Chicago, Illinois, when he was 15 years old. He studied art in high school, particularly drawing and painting, but changed direction in college by enrolling in the music program at Roosevelt University in Chicago.\n\nIn 1967, Lamm was one of the six founding members of a “rock band with horns” - soon to be known as Chicago. After recording six overwhelmingly successful albums, in 1974, Lamm released \"Skinny Boy\", the only solo album from a member of Chicago before the 1980s. Lamm seemingly drifted into a period of both personal and professional frustration. He emerged in 1982 with a new attitude.\n\nA number of solo albums began to appear after Lamm relocated back to New York in 1991. He formed a trio (Beckley-Lamm-Wilson) with Gerry Beckley of the band America and Carl Wilson of The Beach Boys. After Wilson's death from lung cancer in February 1998, an album was released entitled \"Like a Brother\" (2000).\n\nAll of these solo albums and songs were in addition to the continued semi-active recordings by Chicago, \"\", \"\", \"Chicago XXX\", and \"\".\n\nLamm has been a guest lecturer on music production at Stanford University. In 2012, he lectured at New York University on the subject of songwriting.\n\nIn Chicago's early years, Lamm used a simple setup of Hammond organ and Wurlitzer Electric Piano. After the band's first tour of Europe, he began using a Hohner Pianet. Initially, his use of the grand piano was limited to the studio until he began to use one more regularly on stage, purchasing a Steinway Model D Concert Grand by the early 1970s. The Fender Rhodes electric piano became a favorite around 1972. Around 1973–1974 he added a Mellotron and Hohner clavinet in his keyboard rig, and also incorporated Moog and ARP synthesizers. In the late 1970s, he also started using the Yamaha CS-80 synthesizer and possibly a Sequential Circuits Prophet 5. According to an interview with \"Keyboard Magazine\" in 1979, he discovered that he no longer needed the Hammond organ after starting to play the CS80, so he retired it. On a 1980 TV appearance, he played a grand piano with a Multimoog synthesizer above it. He then accessed various synthesizer sound modules via MIDI keyboard controllers such as Yamaha, Kawai, Rhodes, and a Yamaha keytar. Beginning in the late 1980s, he began using the Lync LN1000 keytar. As his primary keyboard, these days, he prefers the Yamaha Motif ES8 keyboard.\n\n\nLamm was married to the late Karen Lamm Wilson (\"née\" Perk) from 1970 to 1971. He married second wife Julie Nini in 1976. They had one daughter, Sacha. They divorced in 1981. Lamm married his third wife, actress Alex Donnelley, in 1985. They had two daughters, Kate and Sean, before divorcing in 1991. He married his fourth wife Joy Kopko in 1991. They have no children.\n\n"}

The championship would get increasing attention in the following years and was promoted to an international World Tour event sanctioned by the International Bodyboarding Association (IBA) in 2002, eventually turning out to be the premiere event of the tour when the Teahuppo Challenge was eliminated due to lack of financial sponsoring.\n\n\nAs the first Shark Island Challenge it was a very informal competition. Comments from the riders gives the notion that it was more like free-surfing. It could be argued that the low money prize and the fact that it did not scored points for the World Tour contributed to this relaxed feeling toward the competition in this year.\n\n\nThe second incarnation of the SIC showed bodyboarding legend Mike Stewart riding like no other. This time again the competition was on a relaxed mood, and despite the Hawaiian efforts the locals dominated the heats.\n\n\nThis year a promising and very anticipated swell for the beginning of June failed to show up and the competition had to be put on hold. Many stand-out invitees had to drop the contest due to previous scheduled trips (Mike Stewart, Spencer Skipper, Jeff Hubbard and Andre Botha). On Monday the 5th of July, with only six days left in the window, an unexpected 4 – 6 foot swell created perfect conditions for the Island. This was so unexpected that some prominent riders missed their heats (Steve Mackenzie, Paul Barnard and Damian King). The Island didn't break again with good condition to the end of the waiting period and the final results were taken from the first round scores. Brazilian Guilherme Tamega surfed Shark Island for the first time during the only day of competition.\n\n\nWith huge, very dangerous conditions on the first round, bodyboarding legend Mike Stewart dominated the competition, by maintaining a good average scoring on the second round small conditions he took the first place on this year's SIC. The locals, although yet a driving force in the competition, started to be replaced by international top bodyboarders on the top 10.\n\n\nThis year presented the heaviest wave conditions for a SIC ever. With former champion Mike Stewart pulling out of the competition due to family commitments, the stage was clear for the other performers.

In about 1934 Triggs hired James (Jim) Armstrong as a sales manager, on commission, for country regions in New South Wales. In 1941 Triggs and Armstrong reached an agreement whereby Armstrong would sell his roughly 25% sales commission share in the Meadow Lea Margarine Company to Triggs' son Kenneth (Ken) when he turned 21 in 1945.\n\nAccordingly, Armstrong sold his commission interests in Meadow Lea to Ken Triggs in 1945, and retired from the company. In about 1956, Oliver and Ken Triggs sold the Meadow Lea Margarine Company to Vegetable Oils Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of the publicly listed company Allied Mills Ltd.\n\nOn 30 April 1986 Allied Mills was taken over by Fielder Gillespie Davis Limited, part of the Goodman Group Ltd (New Zealand), to create Goodman Fielder Ltd. In 1987 Goodman Fielder purchased Wattie Industries Ltd (New Zealand), becoming Goodman Fielder Wattie Ltd, only to divest Wattie Foods to H. J. Heinz Company in 1992 and return to being called Goodman Fielder Ltd. In 2003 Goodman Fielder was acquired by Burns, Philp & Company Limited, being relisted again in 2005.\n\nIn 2010 the MeadowLea product range consisted of six varieties:\n\nOliver Francis Triggs (1895–1962) founded the \"Meadow Lea\" table margarine brand by 1932 and was the first person in Australia to manufacture table margarine, finally selling Meadow Lea to Allied Mills in about 1956. Triggs was born in Melbourne on a small farm, fought with the Light Horse in World War I, then trained as a tailor, before opening a corner grocery shop and making copha butter. After copha butter was banned in Victoria to support the butter industry and pure butter sales, Triggs moved to Sydney in about 1931. He was married to Nita Alice Bek (1895–1974) and had four children, Kenneth, Audray and Marian (twins), and Jill.\n\nFrom about 1935 until 1975, the family home was \"Edgewater\", 3 Sutherland Crescent, Darling Point, bought from the Wirth Bros Circus family. Its water front gardens (including a tennis court and swimming pool) were sold to the neighbouring Carthona in the 1950s, when \"Edgewater\" was divided into three homes (one on each floor) with Triggs retaining the top floor.\n\nIn about 1939–45 Triggs owned the 2,000-acre Kyalla Park sheep farm and horse stud near Orange, which had the first electrified sheep-shearing shed in Australia (built in about 1910 by the previous owners, the Stuart family). The property was slowly subdivided and sold off by its subsequent owner, so that it is now around 150 acres, and has been owned since about 1980 by the Napier family.\n\nKenneth Oliver Triggs OAM (1924 – ), the only son of Oliver Triggs, was a director and 25% shareholder in Meadow Lea from 1945 until the company's sale to Vegetable Oils Pty Ltd in about 1956. He subsequently became a farmer and Chairman of the NSW Egg Board, a manufacturer of polystyrene containers, Chairman of Mutual Home Loans Fund of Australia Limited and Information Electronics Limited. In 2003 he became the Secretary of the Auburn sub-Branch of the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL), and was made a Life Member of the RSL in 2008. He received the Order of Australia Medal in 2011 for service to veterans and their families. He married Ruth Donnison in 1950 and they had two sons, David and Andrew. The couple divorced in about 1976, and in about 1985 Triggs married Lesley-Anne Woodward.\n\nThe Art Deco heritage listed residential home named \"Meadow Lea\" at 22 Sydney Road, East Lindfield, Sydney, was built on four housing lots and completed in about 1941 for James Armstrong, at the time the sales manager of the Meadow Lea Margarine Company. It was sold in 1948 for £17,000 to Azzalin Romano, of the nightclub restaurant Romanos, who had sold his racehorse Bernborough in 1946 to Louis B. Mayer for £93,000. In 1955 the house was sold for £25,000. In 1996 it was purchased by Daniel Kalanderian, the co-founder of the large Sydney store, Victoria's Basement, who added a new wing and put it on the market in September 2010 for $7.5 million.\n\n"}

In December 2007, it relocated to 162 East 33rd Street (between Lexington Avenue and Third Avenue) in Murray Hill. In August 2011, it opened a second branch at 1442 First Avenue (East 75th Street) on the Upper East Side. In November 2017, it opened a cocktail lounge called 2nd Floor above its Upper East Side branch.\n\nIn 1998, the deli won an America’s Classic Award by the James Beard Foundation.\n\nThe delicatessen originally opened in 1954 on the southeast corner of Second Avenue and East 10th Street in the Yiddish Theater District in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan. By that time, most of the Yiddish theaters of the prior half-century had disappeared. The sidewalk at that location has plaques with the names of about fifty stars of the old Yiddish-theatre are embedded into the sidewalk, similar to the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and is known as the Yiddish Walk of Fame.\nSome of the honored stars are Molly Picon, actor Menasha Skulnik, singer and actor Boris Thomashevsky (grandfather of conductor, pianist, and composer Michael Tilson Thomas), and Fyvush Finkel (born Philip Finkel).\n\nThe delicatessen closed briefly following the murder of its founder Abe Lebewohl, a survivor of The Holocaust, during a robbery on March 4, 1996. The crime remains unsolved.\n\nOn January 1, 2006, new owner Jack Lebewohl closed the delicatessen at its original location in the East Village after a rent increase and a dispute over back rent. (The East Village location later became a Chase Bank branch.) On July 31, 2007, Lebewohl announced that the delicatessen would reopen at a new location in the fall of 2007. It reopened on December 17, 2007, at the Murray Hill location with Jeremy Lebewohl, the nephew of its founder, as its new proprietor.\n\nThe delicatessen's specialties include matzoh-ball soup, corned beef, pastrami, knishes, gefilte fish, cholent and other notables of Jewish cuisine. Despite the deli being under kosher supervision, most Orthodox Jews will not eat there because the restaurant is open on Shabbat.\n\nThe original restaurant had a separate room decorated with memorabilia of Yiddish theatre actress Molly Picon, including posters, song sheets, photographs, etc. The new location has pictures of her on the walls for approximately one half of the dining area. The deli's original iconic neon sign is now installed in the City Reliquary in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.\n\nThe deli is one of the few Jewish restaurants in the United States that still serves p'tcha (jellied calves' feet). Given the small and dwindling customer base, p'tcha is made to order upon request.\n\nIn 2013, \"Zagat\" gave it a food rating of 23, and ranked it the 9th-best deli in New York City. It is rated 3 in the top 5 delis in New York.\n\n"}

It is generally served hot. In some establishments the sandwich will be made from bread toasted on only one side, while other establishments serve it on the same roll as is used for hamburgers.\n\nBacon sandwiches are an all-day favourite throughout the United Kingdom. They are often served in British cafes, and are anecdotally recommended as a hangover cure.\n\nThe \"New York Times-London Journal\" reported on a study conducted at Leeds University which consisted of testing 700 variants of the sandwich. They experimented with different cooking styles, types of bacon, breads, oils, and special additions. Each variant was then ranked by 50 tasters. In conclusion, the best bacon sandwiches are made with \"crispy, fried, and not-too-fat bacon between thick slices of white bread.\" \n\nAnother study by the Direct Line for Business listed the top additions to the traditional bacon butty in England. Although the original was still the preferred sandwich, the next top contender was the \"breggy\" which adds an egg. The next popular accessory was mushrooms, followed by cheese. For sauces, brown sauce was slightly favoured over ketchup. \n\nThe BLT is a popular variant of the bacon sandwich with the additional ingredients of lettuce and tomato, but served cold.\n\nNumerous studies have showed a connection between processed meats and an increased risk of serious health conditions such as type 2 diabetes, various cancers, and cardiovascular disease.\n\nA study in 2007 conducted by the World Cancer Research Fund found that there was \"convincing evidence\" of a link between processed meats and an increased chance of cancer. Although no numerical value was provided for the risk, they did state that \"people should not eat more than 500g of red meat a week.\" \n\nThe World Health Organization released a warning concerning the sodium content in bacon. For 100g of bacon, there are approximately 1,500 mg of sodium. Currently, the FDA reports that the average American adult should consume less than 2,300 mg per day. Too much sodium in ones diet can lead to a higher probability of high blood pressure, which is a major cause of heart disease and stroke.\n\n"}

Crocker Skyfarm mansion, which was purchased and donated to the school by the late W. Clement Stone. The school moved to the mansion in 1971.\n\nThe remodeled mansion houses the lower school, grades pre-kindergarten to fourth. The head of lower school is Megan Terra. The middle school and classes for grades five to eight are also located on the Hillsborough campus and include the Hillside Learning Complex, gold-level LEED certified facilities, which house middle school classrooms, and the Cafe, PreK-Undergraduate classes library, a state-of-the-art research and design space known as the I-Lab, and administrative offices that serve the whole school. The head of middle school is Liza Raynal. The head of the Upper School is Stephen Dunn. Other campus facilities include a gymnasium/performance space, science labs, several playgrounds, art studios, and the \"forts,\" a special outdoor play area.

Notable programs include a rich music program designed, in part, by Sir Yehudi Menuhin working with Dr. Genevieve Fitzmaurice. The school's social emotional learning (SEL) curriculum has been part of a Nueva education since its founding, originally called Self-science. The SEL curriculum was developed in large part by Janice Toben. With the development of the I-Lab in 2007, Nueva was one of the first Design Thinking programs for PreK-8, now PreK-12 students, providing every student with training in design thinking methodology, engineering classes, projects, and practices that are now central to Nueva's learning approach.\n\nAnother element of a Nueva education is the annual trips program, further enabling students to live Nueva's motto of \"Learn by Doing, Learn by Caring.\" Each year for grades one through twelve, students have a school trip.

{"id": "1962114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962114", "title": "Bob Sheppard", "text": "Bob Sheppard\n\nRobert Leo Sheppard (October 20, 1910 – July 11, 2010) was the long-time public address announcer for numerous New York area college and professional sports teams, in particular the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (1951–2007), and the New York Giants of the National Football League (1956–2006).\n\nSheppard announced more than 4,500 Yankees baseball games over a period of 56 years, including 22 pennant-winning seasons and 13 World Series championships; he called 121 consecutive postseason contests, 62 games in 22 World Series, and six no-hitters, including three perfect games. He was also the in-house voice for New York Giants football games for more than a half-century , encompassing nine conference championships, three NFL championships (1956, 1986, 1990), and the game often called \"the greatest ever played\", the classic 1958 championship loss to Baltimore.\n\nSheppard's smooth, distinctive baritone and precise, consistent elocution became iconic aural symbols of both the old Yankee Stadium and Giants Stadium. Reggie Jackson famously nicknamed him \"The Voice of God\", and Carl Yastrzemski once said, \"You're not in the big leagues until Bob Sheppard announces your name.\"\n\nSheppard was secretive about his age throughout his life, but according to New York voter records he was born October 20, 1910, in Richmond Hill, Queens, New York City. He graduated from Saint John's Preparatory School in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn in 1928, and attended St. John's University on an athletic scholarship, where he earned seven varsity letters from 1928 to 1932; three in baseball as the starting first baseman, and four in football as the left-handed starting quarterback. He was also elected president of his senior class. In 1933, he received a master's degree in speech education from Columbia University.\n\nSheppard began his career playing semiprofessional football on Long Island with the Valley Stream Red Riders and the Hempstead Monitors, earning $25 a game, and teaching speech at Grover Cleveland High School in Ridgewood, Queens, New York. During World War II he served in the Navy as a gunnery officer aboard cargo ships, both in convoys and on independent missions in the Pacific Theater. After the War he became Chairman of the Speech Department at John Adams High School in Queens, and taught evening courses in public speaking at his alma mater, St. John's University. He also served as speech and debate coach for Sacred Heart Academy's Forensic Team in Hempstead, New York. His multiple teaching jobs overlapped more than 25 years into his announcing career, and he always maintained that his academic work was far more important than his accomplishments as an announcer. \"My sports activity\", he said,\"...cut down on what I really contributed to society, and that's teaching...when I hear from former students and they say I helped them achieve their goals, I feel I have contributed to society more than all I have done in sports.\" As an announcer, he said, \"All I have to recommend is longevity.\"\n\nAfter World War II, Sheppard was hired as the public address announcer for St. John's football and basketball games, a job he kept well into the 1990s. In the late 1940s, he became the announcer for the Brooklyn Dodgers of the All-America Football Conference at Ebbets Field. He came to the attention of the Yankees when a front-office official heard him deliver a tribute to Babe Ruth at a Dodgers football game in 1948. He was offered the Yankees announcing job, but did not accept it until three years later when the Yankees agreed to hire an understudy, so that his duties with the team would not interfere with his teaching responsibilities. He debuted at Yankee Stadium on April 17, 1951 with the Yankees' home opener, a 5–0 win over the Boston Red Sox. In 1956, when the New York Giants football team moved from the Polo Grounds to Yankee Stadium, he began announcing their games as well, and remained with them when they moved to Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey in 1976.\n\nSheppard's first year as the Yankees' announcer was the only one in which Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle shared the outfield. His first game featured eight future Hall of Famers: DiMaggio, Mantle, Johnny Mize, Yogi Berra, and Phil Rizzuto for the Yankees, and Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr, and Lou Boudreau for the Red Sox. The first player he introduced was the Yankee Clipper's brother, Dominic DiMaggio. His 1951 salary was $15 per game, $17 for a doubleheader.\nSheppard's distinctive announcing style became an integral component of the Yankee Stadium experience. For more than half a century each game began with his trademark cadence – \"Good afternoon (evening)...ladies and gentlemen...and welcome...to Yankee Stadium\" – his words reverberating around the massive structure. Each in-game announcement began: \"Your attention please, ladies and gentlemen.\" He introduced every player, Yankee or visitor (as described on his Monument Park plaque), \"with equal divine reverence.\" He communicated the players' position, uniform number, name, and repeated the number, during his first at-bat (\"Now batting for the Yankees, the first baseman, number 23, Don Mattingly, number 23\"), while announcing the players' position and name during each succeeding at-bat (\"The first baseman, Don Mattingly\"). He eschewed flamboyant nicknames; Dennis Boyd was never introduced as \"Oil Can\", nor Jim Hunter as \"Catfish.\" He once listed (in order) his favorite names to announce: Mickey Mantle, Shigetoshi Hasegawa, Salomé Barojas, José Valdivielso and Álvaro Espinoza; and he expressed his special affection for the natural resonance of many Latino players' names. \"Anglo-Saxon names are not very euphonious\", he said. \"What can I do with Steve Sax? What can I do with Mickey Klutts?\" But Mickey Mantle remained his favorite; Sheppard said Mantle once told him, \"'Every time Bob Sheppard introduced me at Yankee Stadium, I got shivers up my spine.' And I said to him, 'So did I.'\"\n\nSheppard took great pride in pronouncing every name correctly, and made certain to check directly with a visiting player if he had any doubt on the correct or preferred pronunciation. He admitted that early in his career, whenever the Senators were in town he particularly feared tripping over Wayne Terwilliger's name. \"I worried that I would say 'Ter-wigg-ler'\", he recalled, \"but I never did.\" He did stumble on at least one rookie's name: Jorge Posada was called up from Columbus late in the 1995 season, and made his first appearance as a Yankee in Game 2 of the 1995 American League Division Series against Seattle, as a pinch runner for Wade Boggs. Sheppard, who had not yet met Posada, announced the substitution, Posada's major league debut, in extra innings of one of the greatest games in Division Series history, with an \"o\" at the end of his last name. Posada's friend Derek Jeter noticed immediately, with amusement, and has called him \"Sado\" ever since.\n\nSheppard made another rare professional error in October 1976 at the Giants' first home game in New Jersey at Giants Stadium against the Cowboys, which he commenced with the startling announcement, \"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Yankee Stadium.\" His other famous faux pas occurred in 1982 at Yankee Stadium, when he inadvertently left his microphone on as Shane Rawley gave up a double on his first pitch in relief, instantly turning a 3–2 lead into a 4–3 deficit. Over the stadium speakers came Sheppard's familiar voice: \"Boy, what relief pitchinginginging!\" Sheppard, ever the gentleman, went to the locker room after the game and apologized to Rawley.\n\nThroughout his career, Sheppard famously refused to reveal his age, once abruptly ending an interview when Jim Bouton asked the question a second time. He readily disclosed his birth month and day, October 20 (possibly because he shared it with Mickey Mantle), but never publicly acknowledged the year. For years, there was conjecture that his compulsive secretiveness stemmed from a fear that Yankees owner George Steinbrenner would think him too old and replace him, but Sheppard denied it. \"[Steinbrenner] never questioned how old I was\", he said. \"He knew I was there every day for 57 years or so.\" In fact, it has been said that Sheppard may have been the only Yankees employee never criticized by Steinbrenner, who called him \"the gold standard.\"\n\nOver the years, Sheppard also served as announcer for multiple other teams and venues, among them Adelphi College (predecessor of Adelphi University); the New York Titans of the American Football League, and the International Soccer League, both at the Polo Grounds; the WFL New York Stars at Downing Stadium on Randall's Island; the All-America Football Conference's New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium; the NASL New York Cosmos at Yankee Stadium, Downing Stadium, and Giants Stadium; Army Black Knights football games at Michie Stadium and Giants Stadium; and multiple Army-Navy games at the Polo Grounds, Giants Stadium, and Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia. \"You name it, I did it\", he said. In later years, the many baseball honors bestowed on him overshadowed his work in other sports. Phil Rizzuto once asked him to name the greatest Yankee Stadium game he had ever announced, probably expecting to hear a good baseball story. \"The day Pat Summerall kicked the field goal in the snow in 1958\", Sheppard replied, referring to the legendary December 14 Giants victory over Cleveland.\n\nSheppard retired from his position with the Giants, a 50-year handshake agreement with Giants owner Wellington Mara, at the end of the 2005 season, when the commute from his home on Long Island to East Rutherford, New Jersey became too strenuous. His final game was the Giants' playoff loss to the Carolina Panthers on January 8, 2006. He was succeeded by his long-time understudy, former debate student, and colleague in the Speech Department at St. John's University, Jim Hall.\nAt age 95, health issues began to take their toll: In 2006, Sheppard missed his first Yankees home opener since 1951 after injuring his hip. He was back in time for the next homestand, but it marked the beginning of a slow but inexorable deterioration of his health over the next two seasons. He called what turned out to be his final game, a 10–2 win over Seattle, on September 5, 2007. The following week, he was hospitalized with a bronchial infection, forcing him to miss the final homestand and the AL Division Series against Cleveland, thus ending his streak of 121 consecutive postseason games at Yankee Stadium. Although he signed a new two-year contract with the Yankees in March 2008, and he particularly looked forward to announcing the 2008 All-Star Game, which was played at Yankee Stadium, he missed the entire 2008 season. He also reluctantly admitted that he lacked sufficient strength to call the final game at the original ballpark on September 21, 2008. \"I don't have my best stuff\", he said. Sheppard's recorded voice did announce the starting lineups for that final game, a 7–3 victory over the Orioles. Jim Hall replaced him for the 2008 season, and Paul Olden took over when the Yankees moved to the new ballpark in 2009.\n\nTwo weeks after his 99th birthday in 2009, the day after the Yankees defeated Philadelphia to win their 27th World Series, Sheppard officially announced his retirement as the Yankees' public address announcer. \"I have no plans of coming back\", he told MLB.com. \"Time has passed me by, I think. I had a good run for it. I enjoyed doing what I did. I don't think, at my age, I'm going to suddenly regain the stamina that is really needed if you do the job and do it well.\"\n\nHe died at his home in Baldwin, New York on July 11, 2010, three months and nine days shy of his 100th birthday, and two days before the death of owner George Steinbrenner . In announcing his father's death, Sheppard's son Paul said, \"I know St. Peter will now recruit him. If you're lucky enough to go to Heaven, you'll be greeted by a voice saying, 'Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Heaven!'\"\n\nIn 2000, during his 50th year with the Yankees, Sheppard donated the microphone he used for a half-century of Yankee Stadium announcements to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. May 7 of that 50th year was designated \"Bob Sheppard Day\", and a plaque honoring him was unveiled in Yankee Stadium's Monument Park. At the pre-game ceremony Walter Cronkite read the inscription, which states in part that his voice was \"...as synonymous with Yankee Stadium as its copper facade and Monument Park.\" The media dining room in the new stadium is named \"Sheppard's Place\".\n\nThe Yankees' first home game after Sheppard's death, a 5–4 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays on July 16, 2010, was played with an empty public address booth and no announcements. The Yankees wore a Bob Sheppard commemorative patch on the left sleeve of their home and road jerseys for the remainder of the 2010 season.\n\nThe United States House of Representatives passed a resolution \"commending Bob Sheppard for his long and respected career\" by voice vote on November 16, 2010. It was introduced by Carolyn McCarthy from , where Sheppard lived for 70 years.\n\nIn 2008 Derek Jeter asked Sheppard to record his at-bat introductions. The recordings were used to introduce Jeter's home at-bats from the beginning of the 2008 season until his final game at Yankee Stadium on September 25, 2014. Sheppard was flattered: \"It has been one of the greatest compliments I have received in my career of announcing. The fact that he wanted my voice every time he came to bat is a credit to his good judgment and my humility.\" Sheppard's recorded voice also introduced Jeter at the 2010 All-Star Game in Anaheim two days after Sheppard's death. Sheppard voices the introduction to \"The Baseball Experience\" at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.\n\nOn September 26, 2013, a recording of Sheppard's introduction, followed by Metallica's Enter Sandman, were played as Mariano Rivera stepped to the mound at Yankee Stadium for the final time. His voice has also continued to be used for the opening of the Yankees' annual Old Timers' Day ceremonies.\n\nSheppard was elected to the St. John's University Sports Hall of Fame, the Long Island Sports Hall of Fame, and the New York Sports Hall of Fame. He was awarded honorary doctorates from St. John's University (Pedagogy) and Fordham University (Rhetoric), and in 2007, received St. John's' Medal of Honor, the highest award that the university can confer on a graduate.\n\nSt. John's University annually awards the Sheppard Trophy, one of its highest awards, to the most outstanding student-athlete. The National Association of Sports Public Address Announcers presents the Bob Sheppard P.A. Announcer of the Year Award annually. St. John’s also named the press box at Jack Kaiser Stadium in honor of Sheppard in 2015.\n\nIn 1998, Sheppard was presented with the prestigious William J. Slocum \"Long and Meritorious Service\" Award by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, and the \"Pride of the Yankees\" award by the Yankees organization.\n\nSheppard is one of only two people ever awarded both a World Series ring and a Super Bowl ring. The other was Bill King, the long-time radio play-by-play voice of the Oakland Raiders and Oakland Athletics, and another man famously secretive about his age.\n\nSheppard was married twice. He had two sons, Paul and Chris; and two daughters, Barbara and Mary; four grandchildren; and (as of 2008) nine great-grandchildren. His first wife, Margaret, the mother of all four of his children, died in 1959. He and his second wife, Mary, were married from 1961 until his death.\n\nSheppard was deeply religious, \"...as strong in his Roman Catholic faith as anybody I knew\", wrote his longtime friend, George Vecsey. \"[In old age] he hated to admit he could no longer serve as a lector. His faith never wavered in the trying days. His daughter [Mary] is a nun. He referred to [his wife] Mary as 'my archangel,' meaning she saved his life, day by day.\" \n\n"}
{"id": "1962117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962117", "title": "Ars moriendi", "text": "Ars moriendi\n\nThe Ars moriendi (\"The Art of Dying\") are two related Latin texts dating from about 1415 and 1450 which offer advice on the protocols and procedures of a good death, explaining how to \"die well\" according to Christian precepts of the late Middle Ages. It was written within the historical context of the effects of the macabre horrors of the Black Death 60 years earlier and consequent social upheavals of the 15th century. The earliest versions were most likely composed in southern Germany. It was very popular, translated into most West European languages, and was the first in a western literary tradition of guides to death and dying. About 50,000 copies were printed in the \"incunabula\" period before 1501 and further editions were printed after 1501. Its popularity reduced as Erasmus's treatise on preparing for death (\"de praeparatione ad mortem\", 1533) became more popular.\n\nThere was originally a \"long version\" and a later \"short version\" containing eleven woodcut pictures as instructive images which could be easily explained and memorized.These woodcut images were circulated in both print and individual engravings. They could then easily be pinned to a wall for viewing. \n\nThe authors of the two texts are unknown, but assumed to be Dominican churchmen, as they echo Jean de Gerson's publication, the \"Opusculum Tripartitu\", containing a section named \"De arte Moriendi\". Gerson may have been influenced by earlier references in 'compendia of faith' dating back to the thirteenth century, but the content was uniquely his own.\n\nThe original \"long version\", called \"Tractatus\" (or \"Speculum\") \"artis bene moriendi\", was composed in 1415 by an anonymous Dominican friar, probably at the request of the Council of Constance (1414–1418, Germany). This was widely read and translated into most West European languages, and was very popular in England, where a tradition of consolatory death literature survived until the 17th century. Works in the English tradition include \"The Way of Dying Well\" and \"The Sick Mannes Salve\". In 1650, \"Holy Living and Holy Dying\" became the \"artistic climax\" of the tradition that had begun with \"Ars moriendi\".\n\n\"Ars Moriendi\" was also among the first books printed with movable type and was widely circulated in nearly 100 editions before 1500, in particular in Germany. The long version survives in about 300 manuscript versions, only one illustrated.\n\n\"Ars moriendi\" consists of six chapters:\n\n\nThe \"short version\", whose appearance shortly precedes the introduction in the 1460s of block books (books printed from carved blocks of wood, both text and images on the same block), first dates to around 1450, from the Netherlands. It is mostly an adaptation of the second chapter of the \"long version\", and contains eleven woodcut pictures. The first ten woodcuts are divided into 5 pairs, with each set showing a picture of the devil presenting one of the 5 temptations, and the second picture showing the proper remedy for that temptation. The last woodcut shows the dying man, presumably having successfully navigated the maze of temptations, being accepted into heaven, and the devils going back to hell in confusion.\n\nThe \"short version\" was as popular as the \"long version\", but there was no English translation, perhaps because educated English people at the time were expected to understand several European languages. There are six extant manuscripts of the short version, most not illustrated, and over twenty extant blockbook illustrated editions, using 13 different sets of blocks.\n\nAs well as the eleven different sets of blockbook woodcuts, there is a set by Master E. S. in engraving. The lengthy controversy over their respective dating and priority is now resolved by the discovery by Fritz Saxl of an earlier illuminated manuscript, of well before 1450, from whose tradition all the images in the printed versions clearly derive. Studies of the watermarks of the blockbooks by Allen Stevenson at the British Museum in the 1960s confirmed that none of them predated the 1460s, so Master E. S.' engravings are the earliest printed versions, dating from around 1450. The images remain largely the same in all media for the rest of the century.\n\nThere is the exceptional number of about seventy incunabulum editions, in a variety of languages, from Catalan to Dutch, the earliest from about 1474 from Cologne.\n\nAllegorically the images depicted the contest between angels and demons over the fate of the dying man. In his dying agony his soul emerges from his mouth to be received by one of a band of angels.\nCommon themes portrayed by illustrators include skeletons, the Last Judgement, corpses, and the forces of good and evil battling over souls.\n\nThe popularity of the \"Ars moriendi\" texts developed into a broader tradition of writing on the good death. Jeremy Taylor's books \"Holy Living and Holy Dying\", published in 1650 and 1651, exemplify that tradition. It developed in both Protestant and Catholic veins and continued in various forms through the nineteenth century.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1962144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962144", "title": "Jaara baby", "text": "Jaara baby\n\nThe Jaara baby was an Aboriginal Australian child who died at some stage during the 1840s to 1860s. The child's remains were discovered in 1904, and kept in storage by Museum Victoria for ninety-nine years, until in 2003 they were repatriated to the Dja Dja Wurrung community. The remains were of particular significance because they were found traditionally wrapped in possum skins along with about 130 other artifacts of both European and Aboriginal origin.\n\nThe Jaara baby was first discovered by Europeans on 10 September 1904, near the town of Charlton, Victoria, by a woodcutter. He was felling a hollow tree when he discovered the remains wrapped in a possum skin bundle hidden within the tree's trunk. The remains were referred to the Victorian Coroner at the time, who determined that they had been buried in accordance with Aboriginal custom. He suggested that the remains be given to the National Museum of Victoria.\n\nAlthough it had been buried in accordance with Aboriginal custom, there was some doubt as to the identity of the Jaara baby, primarily because it was buried with both Aboriginal and European artifacts. These included Aboriginal necklaces, an apron and a tool belt, along with European items such as a button, an axe head and a baby's bootie. The items were sprinkled with ochre before they were tied up in a bundle of dried possum skins.\n\nAt one point, Gary Foley, who at the time was the curator of the Bunjilaka exhibition at the Melbourne Museum, was approached by a white man from Canberra who claimed that the Jaara baby was an ancestor of his. He claimed that the baby was actually a European child, who had been abducted by Aboriginal tribesmen during the period of frontier violence which decimated Aboriginal populations in Victoria's west during the mid-nineteenth century. Although tests on the Jaara remains were not conclusive, they did reveal that the child was no more than eighteen months old, whereas the abducted white child was three years old.\n\nHowever, the question of why the baby was buried along with European artifacts is still unanswered. Gary Murray, chairman of the Northwest Region Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Board (and a member of the Dja Dja Wurrung nation), has suggested that the Jaara baby was probably the child of an elder or tribal chief, due to the sheer number and richness of the grave goods. The European items were probably included as a record of the tribe's history at the time, a memorial of conflict with European settlers.\n\nThe baby remained in storage at Museum Victoria until 1994, when researchers from an Aboriginal cultural protection cooperative came across it in the museum catalogue, and were given permission to examine the remains. Later, anthropologist Alan West commenced a study to catalogue all remains in storage at the Museum, including the Jaara baby.\n\nIn 2002, Gary Murray was negotiating the return of a number of artifacts from the Museum Victoria collection, under the Museum's repatriation program, begun in the 1980s. He was given a list of the Dja Dja Wurrung artifacts that the Museum had in their possession. However, one Museum employee noticed that the Jaara baby was not on the list. Murray approached Gary Foley, who in turn approached the Museum, and, after some dispute, it was agreed that the Jaara baby was to be repatriated.\n\nAlan West did not want the bundle to be returned, since he had nearly finished his cataloguing project, and had wanted to separate the remains from the grave goods. This proposal was rejected outright by Murray and other members of the Northwest Region Board. Eventually, West resigned from the Museum in late August 2003.\n\nOn 10 September 2003, the Jaara baby was finally returned to its home in Dja Dja Wurrung country, and was reburied, ninety-nine years after it was removed. A handover ceremony, which included ceremonial dances by both Dja Dja Wurrung and Wurundjeri people, was conducted by Lord Mayor of Melbourne John So.\n\n"}

At the same time, the \"sergeant\" portion of the title was more and more commonly dropped; by the early 18th century, the rank's name had been permanently shortened to major general. \n\nSince sergeant major general had ranked below lieutenant general, the newly named rank of major general appeared to create a precedence issue, in that a major outranks a lieutenant but a lieutenant general outranks a major general. This continues to cause confusion to those unfamiliar with the history of the rank, particularly in those armies using insignia similar to the British Army. The rank is sometimes used by paramilitary organizations such as militias.\n"}
{"id": "1962164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962164", "title": "Colonel commandant", "text": "Colonel commandant\n\nColonel commandant is a military title used in the armed forces of some English-speaking countries. The title, not a substantive military rank, could denote a senior colonel with authority over fellow colonels. Today, the holder often has an honorary role outside the executive military structure, such as advocacy for the troops.\n\nIn the British Army, the term \"colonel-commandant\" goes back at least to the American War of Independence, when it denoted an officer in command of a regiment.\n\nIn 1921, the Army abolished the appointment of brigadier-general and replaced it with the new appointments of colonel-commandant and colonel on the staff: Colonels-commandant commanded brigades, depots or training establishments, while colonels on the staff held administrative appointments. Like brigadier-general, both of the new appointments were temporary, the holder reverting to his substantive rank (usually colonel) at the end of his appointment. They were both abolished from 1 June 1928, replaced by the appointment of brigadier (though the rank insignia – a crown over three \"pips\" or stars – remained the same). The Indian Army used the same appointments.\n\nIn the Royal Marines, the ranks of colonel commandant and colonel 2nd commandant dated back to 1755, when fifty companies of marines were raised in three divisions: each division had a colonel commandant and a colonel 2nd commandant. These ranked below major-general and above lieutenant-colonel; a colonel 2nd commandant ranked with a Royal Navy captain or an Army colonel, while a colonel commandant ranked with a commodore or a brigadier-general. The Royal Marines adopted the appointment of brigadier-general to be held by its colonels commandant (then five in number) in 1913, and dispensed with it again in 1921. Like the Army, the Royal Marines adopted the appointment of brigadier in 1928, but the ranks of colonel commandant and colonel 2nd commandant persisted at least as far as World War II. By 1957, however, they had been abolished and replaced with brigadier (now a rank instead of an appointment, as in the Army) and colonel.\n\nThe title of colonel-commandant is now used as an honorary or ceremonial title relating to a military corps. For example, General Sir Richard Dannatt was Colonel-Commandant of the Army Air Corps as well as his full-time role as Chief of the General Staff and Brigadier Jane Arigho, a retired Director of Army Nursing Services, is the Colonel-Commandant of Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps.\n\nThe Canadian Armed Forces widely uses colonels commandant as honorary appointments to act as advocates for members and to advise on relevant policy matters. In reserve regiments there has usually been an honorary colonel and an honorary lieutenant-colonel, while in the Regular Force, the title used is colonel commandant or colonel of the regiment. Many units also have a colonel-in-chief who is often a member of the Royal Family, frequently with a name connection to the regiment. Example: The Queen's York Rangers (First American Regiment) having the Queen and later the Duke of York, as Colonel-in-Chief. In the artillery, the monarch holds this role with the appellation \"Captain-General\". All of these \"honoraries\" are in head-of-family roles, approachable in varying degrees by anyone in the \"regimental family\".\n\nThe colonel commandant of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps, is an appointment given by the Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of Canada to a distinguished retired armoured forces officer. The appointment is for three years, during which the incumbent is on the Canadian Forces' reserve list as the senior officer of the corps. He is responsible for advising the army commander on matters pertaining to the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps. A colonel commandant travels widely to canvass the views of all ranks in the corps and frequently attends military policy conferences, ceremonies and unit celebrations. He is an \"ex officio\" member of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps Association's executive committee.\n\nIn 2001, the Canadian Forces Medical Branch canvassed past and present members for nominations to the role of colonel commandant. The role is ceremonial but the colonel commandant acts as a link between the Canadian Forces Medical Branch and the wider civilian medical community. The position is not restricted to former senior medical officers; consideration is given to medical practitioners who are \"particularly prominent and well respected within the world of civilian medicine.\"\n\nUntil 1882, William Acland Douglas, who served in the 50th Regiment, was colonel-commandant of the military forces in Victoria.\n\nAustralian formations, such as the Royal Australian Corps of Military Police and the Royal Australian Regiment (RAR) have Colonel Commandants, a retired soldier whose role is to act as advocate for the troops' interests. This requires visits to wherever the corps or regiment is deployed.\n\nIn the Pakistan Army the post of colonel commandant is an honorary post held by the most senior serving member of a corps or regiments, he is usually a general officer in the rank of Lieutenant General. The post is found is all corps and regiments of the army, e.g. the colonel commandant of Baloch Regiment.\n\nIn India colonel commandant is a 'non-substantive' rank, and is usually held by general officers mostly major generals or lieutenant generals. The officer would have been once part of the regiment, and in this role he represents the regiment and its men at the higher level of military hierarchy. This is especially in matters related to troop welfare. In photographs where the officer is portrayed as the 'colonel commandant', the rank insignia of a brigadier affixed on a maroon/vine red background is used.\n\nIn the National Cadet Corps, which is closely connected to Indian universities the vice chancellor of the university is given the honorary rank of 'colonel commandant'. Vice chancellors are eligible to wear the NCC khakhi uniform and wear the insignia, even though they would not have any military experience. In NCC this appointment is purely ceremonial.\n\nIn the Sri Lankan Army the post of colonel commandant is an honorary post held by the most senior serving member of a corps, he/she is usually a general officer or a brigadier. The post is found in all corps of the army as well as the Mechanized Infantry Regiment and the Sri Lanka National Guard. It is similar in function to that of colonel of the regiment found in multi-battalion infantry regiments.\n\nIn 1779, Hungarian-born Colonel Commandant Michael Kovats died leading the Continental Army cavalry against British troops at Charleston.\n\nThe highest-ranking officer of the United States Marine Corps was formerly titled Colonel Commandant: the title now is simply Commandant. Colonel-Commandant was also used for Lloyd J. Beall, the commanding officer of the short-lived Confederate States Marine Corps during the American Civil War.\n\nAt the Alamo, William B. Travis was given the position of lieutenant colonel commandant.\n\n"}
{"id": "1962178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962178", "title": "Acrotomophilia", "text": "Acrotomophilia\n\nAcrotomophilia (from the Greek ἀκρότομος \"having the top cut off\" (from ἄκρον \"akron\" \"extremity\" and -τομος \"-tomos\" from τέμνω \"temno\" \"I cut\") and φιλία \"philia\" \"love\") is a paraphilia in which an individual expresses strong sexual interest in amputees. It is a counterpart to \"apotemnophilia\", the sexual interest in \"being\" an amputee.\n\nAcrotomophiles may be attracted to amputees because they like the way they look or they may view the amputee’s stump as a phallic object which can be used for sexual pleasure. Acrotomophiles may enjoy the idea of dominating the amputee during couples play and they may also become aroused with the thought of having to take care of an amputee.\n\nIn a survey of acrotomophiles, leg amputations were preferred over arm amputations, amputations of a single limb over double amputations, and amputations that left a stump over amputations that left no stump. According to Solvang (2007), “Devotees adhere to standard conceptions of attractiveness in all other matters outside of amputations.” A Jungian explanation for the fetish is that it stems from a desire to resolve discontinuities in the collective unconscious by means of distorting the geometric representation of man, which traditionally involves five points, six when focusing on male sexuality, and seven when discussing incarnations of the Logos from certain religious cultures.\n\nSome people question whether amputating one's own body parts or operating on a partner for the sake of sexual pleasure is ethical. For some, modifying the body is a private ritual of self-ownership and freedom of choice. Psychiatrists may make a diagnosis of Body integrity identity disorder (B.I.I.D.).\n\nThe term \"amelotatism\" has also been used to describe acrotomophilia. The sexual interest in \"being\" an amputee is \"apotemnophilia\". John Money (1977) used the terms \"autoapotemnophilia\" and \"alloapotemnophilia\" to describe the erotic interest of wanting to be or appear as an amputee versus wanting amputees as sexual partners; neither term has been widely used since. The term \"teratophilia\" is used to describe arousal from deformed or monstrous people.\n\n"}

A realistic playwright, along with Aleksandr Ostrovsky he was responsible for the first dramatization of ordinary people in the history of Russian theatre. \"Pisemsky's great narrative gift and exceptionally strong grip on reality make him one of the best Russian novelists,\" according to D.S. Mirsky.\n\nPisemsky's first novel \"Boyarschina\" (1847, published 1858) was originally forbidden for its unflattering description of the Russian nobility. His principal novels are \"The Simpleton\" (1850), \"One Thousand Souls\" (1858), which is considered his best work of the kind, and \"Troubled Seas\", which gives a picture of the excited state of Russian society around the year 1862. He also wrote plays, including \"A Bitter Fate\" (also translated as \"A Hard Lot\"), which depicts the dark side of the Russian peasantry. The play has been called the first Russian realistic tragedy; it won the Uvarov Prize of the Russian Academy.\n\nAleksey Pisemsky was born at his father's Ramenye estate in the Chukhloma province of Kostroma. His parents were retired colonel Feofilakt Gavrilovich Pisemsky and his wife Yevdokiya Shipova. In his autobiography, Pisemsky described his family as belonging to the ancient Russian nobility, although his more immediate progenitors were all very poor and unable to read or write:\nAleksey remained the only child in the family, four infants dying before his birth and five after. Years later he described himself (to which other people attested) as a weak, capricious and whimsical boy who for some reason loved to mock clergymen and suffered from sleepwalking at one time. Pisemsky remembered his father as a military service man in every sense of the word, strict and duty-bound, a man of honesty in terms of money, severe and strict. \"Some of our serfs were horrified by him, not all of them, though, only those who were foolish and lazy; those who were smart and industrious were favoured by him,\" he remarked.\n\nPisemsky remembered his mother a nervous, dreamy, astute, eloquent (even if not well educated) and rather sociable woman. \"Except for those clever eyes of hers, she wasn't good-looking, and once, when I was a student, my father asked me: 'Tell me Aleksey, why do you think your mother becomes more attractive with age?' – 'Because she has a lot of inner beauty which, as years go by, becomes more and more evident', I answered, and he had to agree with me,\" Pisemsky later wrote. His mother's cousins were Yury Bartenev, one of the most prominent Russian Freemasons (colonel Marfin in the novel \"Masons\") and Vsevolod Bartenev (Esper Ivanovich in \"People of the Forties\"), a Navy officer; both exerted considerable influence upon the boy.\n\nPisemsky spent the first ten years of his life in the small regional town of Vetluga where his father served as Mayor. Later he moved with his parents to the countryside. Pisemsky described the years he spent there in Chapter 2 of \"People of the Forties\", an autobiographical novel in which he figured under the name of Pasha. Fond of hunting and horseback riding, the boy received scant education: his tutors were a local deacon, a defrocked drunkard, and a strange old man who was known to have toured the area for decades, giving lessons. Aleksey learned reading, writing, arithmetics, Russian and Latin from them. In his autobiography Pisemsky wrote: \"Nobody had ever forced me to learn, and I wasn't an avid learner, but I read a lot and that was my passion: by 14 I consumed, in translation, of course, most of Walter Scott's novels, \"Don Quixote\", \"Gil Blas\", \"Faublas\", \"Le Diable boiteux\", \"The Serapion Brethren\", a Persian novel called \"Haggi Baba\"... As for children's books, I couldn't stand them and, as far as I remember now, considering them very silly.\" Pisemsky wrote scornfully of his primary education and regretted failing to learn any languages besides Latin. He found in himself, however, a natural predisposition to mathematics, logic and aesthetics.\n\nIn 1834, at the age of 14, Alexey's father took him to Kostroma, to enroll him in the local gymnasium. Memories of his school life found their way into the short story \"The Old Man\" and the novel \"Men of the Forties\". \"I started well, was perceptive and hard-working, but gained most of my popularity as an amateur actor,\" he later remembered. Inspired by \"The Dnieper Mermaid\" (an opera by Ferdinand Kauer), performed by a wandering troupe of actors, Pisemsky, along with his roommate, organized a home theater and had great success with his first role, that of Prudius in \"The Cossack Poet\" by Prince Alexander Shakhovskoy. This first triumph had a dramatic effect upon the boy who adopted what he called an \"aesthetic way of life\", much under the influence of Vsevolod Nikitovich Bartenev, his uncle. Bartenev supplied his nephew with the newest novels and journals and prompted him to begin studying music and playing the piano, which the boy did, according to one of his friends, \"with the expressiveness yet unheard of\".\n\nIt was while in school that Pisemsky started writing. \"My 5th form teacher of literature credited me with having talent; in the 6th form I wrote a novella called \"The Circassian Girl\", and in the 7th a still longer one entitled \"The Iron Ring\", both worthy of mention, apparently, only as stylistic exercises, dealing as they did with things I was totally ignorant of at the time,\" Pisemsky remembered. He sent \"The Iron Ring\" (a novel telling of his first romantic passion) to several Saint Petersburg journals and met with all-round rejection. Several months later, already a university student, he gave the novel to Stepan Shevyryov. The professor's reaction was negative and he made a point to discourage the young man from writing about things he knew nothing about.\n\nIn 1840, upon graduation from the gymnasium, Pisemsky joined the Faculty of Mathematics at Moscow State University, having overcome resistance from his father who insisted upon his son enrolling in the Demidov Lyceum, for it was closer to home and his education there would have been free. Pisemsky later regarded his choice of faculty as a very fortunate one, even while admitting he drew little practical value out of university lectures. Attending assorted lectures by professors from other faculties, he became acquainted with Shakespeare, Schiller, Goethe, Corneille, Racine, Rousseau, Voltaire, Hugo and George Sand and started to form an educated view on the history of Russian literature. Contemporaries pointed at Pisemsky's two major influences of the time: Belinsky and Gogol. Besides, as Pisemsky's friend Boris Almazov remembered, Pavel Katenin, the follower of French classicism and Russian translator of Racine and Cornel, whom Pisemsky knew through being a neighbour, exerted some influence upon him as well. According to Almazov, Pisemsky had a considerable dramatic talent, and it was Katenin who helped him to develop it.\n\nBy 1844 Pisemsky was known as a gifted reciter, his repertoire consisting mostly of works by Gogol. According to Almazov, his solo concerts in his flat on Dolgoruky Lane were immensely popular among both students and visiting schoolboys. A real hit was Pisemsky's performance as Podkolyosin in Gogol's \"Marriage\" featured by one of Moscow's small private theaters. \"Those were the times when Podkolyosin was being portrayed by our great comedian Schepkin, the Imperial Theatre star. Some of those who saw Pisemsky's performance were of the opinion that he presented this character better than Schepkin did,\" wrote Almazov. Having earned a word-of-mouth reputation as a master of recitals, Pisemsky started to get invitations to perform all over Saint Petersburg and its provinces.\n\nPavel Annenkov later remembered: \"He performed his own works masterfully, and was able to find exceptionally expressive intonations for every character he was bringing to the stage, which gave a strong effect in his dramatic plays. Equally brilliant was Pisemsky's rendering of his collection of anecdotes concerning his earlier life experiences. He had loads of such anecdotes and each contained a more or less complete character type. Many found their way into his books in a revised form.\"\n\nAfter graduating from the University in 1844, Pisemsky joined the Office of State Properties in Kostroma and was soon transferred to the corresponding department in Moscow. In 1846 he retired and spent two years living in Moscow Province. In 1848 he married Ekaterina, Pavel Svinyin's daughter, and returned to the state office, again in Kostroma, as a special envoy for Prince Suvorov, then the Kostroma governor. After a stint as an assessor in the local government (1849–1853) Pisemsky joined the Ministry of Imperial Lands in Saint Petersburg where he stayed until 1859. In 1866 he joined the Moscow government as a councilor, soon becoming Chief councilor. He finally quit the civil service (as Court Councilor) in 1872. Pisemsky's state official career in the provinces had a profound effect upon him and his major works.\n\nLater Boris Almazov made an important observation in a commemorative speech: \"Most of our writers who describe the lives of Russian state officials and people from governmental spheres have only fleeting experiences of this kind... More often than not they've served only formally, hardly noticing the faces of their chiefs, let alone those of their colleagues. Pisemsky treated working for the State differently. He gave himself to serving the Russian state wholeheartedly and, whatever post he occupied, had one single objective in mind: fighting the dark forces which our government and the best part of our society try to fight...\" This, according to the speaker, enabled the author not only to fathom the depths of Russian life but to delve down \"to the very core of the Russian soul.\"\n\nBiographer and critic Alexander Skabichevsky found some similarities in the development of Pisemsky and Saltykov-Schedrin, another author who examined the provincial bureaucracy in the times of \"total corruption, embezzlement, no laws for landowners, wild atrocities, and a total lack of real state power\"; times when \"provincial life was mostly uncultured and lacked even basic morality,\" and \"the life of the intelligent classes had the character of one wanton, never ending orgy.\" Both writers, according to the biographer, \"have lost all motivation not just for the idealization of Russian life, but also of highlighting its lighter, positive sides\". Yet, while Saltykov-Schedrin, a forward-looking stalwart of the Saint Petersburg circles, had every opportunity to be imbued with the high ideals which were making their way into Russian cities from Europe, and to make these ideals the foundation to build his outward negativity upon, Pisemsky, once he found himself in the Russian provinces, became disillusioned in whatever ideas he'd gotten at the University, seeing them as idealistic with no roots in Russian reality, Skabichevsky noted. The biographer wrote: \n\nPisemsky's early works exhibited profound disbelief in the higher qualities of humanity, and a disdain for the opposite sex. Reflecting upon possible reasons for this, Skabichevsky pointed at those first years spent in Kostroma when the young Pisemsky had lost sight of whatever lofty ideals he might have been exposed to while studying in the capital. \"With my [stage] success as Podkolesin my scientific and aesthetic life ended. What lie ahead was only grief and the need to find work. My father was dead already, my mother, shocked by his death, was paralyzed and lost her speech, my means were meagre. With this in mind I returned to the country and gave myself to melancholy and hypochondria,\" Pisemsky wrote in his autobiography. On the other hand, it was his continuous official errand trips throughout the Kostroma governorate that provided Pisemsky with the priceless material he used in his future literary work.\n\nHis first novella \"Is She to Blame?\" Pisemsky wrote while still a university student. He gave it to professor Stepan Shevyryov and the latter, being an opponent of the \"natural school\", recommended to the author \"to soften up everything and make it more gentlemanly.\" Pisemsky agreed to do so, but didn't hurry to follow this advice. What he did instead was send the professor \"Nina\", a naive story about a fresh-looking, beautiful girl who turns into a dull matron. Shevyryov made some editorial cuts and then published the story in the July 1848 issue of the \"Syn Otechestva\" magazine. So curtailed and disfigured was this version, that the author never even thought of re-issuing it. The story made its way into the posthumous Wolf's Publishing House 1884 collection of Pisemsky's works (Volume 4). Even in this curtailed form it bore, according to Skabichevsky, every mark of misanthropy and pessimism, seeds of which were sown in \"Boyarschina\".\n\nPisemsky's first novel \"Boyarschina\" was written in 1845. Sent to \"Otechestvennye Zapiski\" in 1847, it was banned by the censors – allegedly for \"promoting the idea of 'George Sandean' [free] love.\" When finally published in 1858, the novel failed to make any impact. Still, according to biographer A. Gornfeld, it featured all the elements of Pisemsky's style: expressive naturalism, vitality, lots of comical details, the lack of positivity and powerful language.\n\nIn the early 1840s the Russian Slavophile movement divided into two branches. The old school followers led by the brothers Aksakov, Ivan Kireyevsky and Aleksey Khomyakov, grouped first around \"Moskovsky Sbornik\", then \"Russkaya Beseda\". Mikhail Pogodin's \"Moskvityanin\" became the center of the younger Slavophiles who were later labeled potchvenniky ('the soil-bound'), Apollon Grigoriev, Boris Almazov, and Alexander Ostrovsky among them. In 1850 \"Moskvityanin\" invited Pisemsky to join in and the latter promptly sent Ostrovsky his second novel \"The Simpleton\" he'd been working on throughout 1848. In November of that year the story of a young idealist who dies after his illusions have been destroyed, was published in \"Moskvityanin\", to a critical and public acclaim. A year later \"Marriage of Passion\" (Брак по страсти) appeared in the same magazine, again praised by the reviewers. Now raised to the ranks of \"the best writers of our times\", Pisemsky found his works compared to those of Ivan Turgenev, Ivan Goncharov and Alexander Ostrovsky. Pavel Annenkov remembered:\n\nPisemsky's debut play \"The Hypochondriac\" (1852) was followed by the \"Sketches of Peasant life\", a three-part short stories cycle. In Pisemsky's second play, \"The Divide\" (Раздел, 1853), a typical natural school piece, parallels have been found with Turgenev's comedy \"Breakfast at the Chief's\". Speaking about Pisemsky's early works, Skabichevsky wrote: \"Dig deeper into the pessimism which has gone into full swing in \"The Muff\" and \"Marriage by Passion\", put it next to the mindset of an ordinary provincial man for examination and you'll be struck by the identical nature of the two. At the bottom of this outlook lies the conviction that man deep in his soul is a scoundrel, moved only by practical interests and egotistical, mostly dirty impulses, and for this reason one has to be on one's guard with one's neighbour and always keep 'a stone by one's bosom'.\"\n\nInfluenced for many years by this provincial philosophy, Pisemsky to a large extent made it his own, according to the biographer. \"Long before \"Troubled Seas\", people of high education, embracing progressive ideas and a new outlook were being shown invariably as outrageous, vulgar rogues, worse than even the ugliest freaks of the uneducated community,\" Skabichevsky argued.\n\nAccording to Annenkov, some of the 'thinking men of the time' simply refused to put up with this peculiar kind of \"delight, drawn from the naked comic nature of situations,\" seeing this as akin to \"the rapture a street mob enjoys when shown a hunch-backed Petrushka or other physical deformities.\" Annenkov quoted Vasily Botkin, a \"terse and far-seeing critic\" as saying that he \"could not sympathize with the author who, although unquestionably gifted, apparently has neither principles of his own nor ideas to base his stories upon.\"\n\nEncouraged by his early success, Pisemsky became very active and in 1850–1854 several of his novels, novellas, comedies, and sketches appeared in different journals, among them \"The Comic Actor\", \"The Petersburg Man\" and \"Mr. Batmanov\". In 1854 Pisemsky decided to leave his post as a local government assessor in Kostroma and moved to Saint Petersburg where he made quite an impression upon the literary community with his provincial originality, but also some ideas which the Russian capital's cultural elite found shocking. He had no time for the idea of women's emancipation and confessed to experiencing a \"kind of organic revolt\" towards all foreigners which he couldn't overcome by any means.\" The notion of human development in general was totally foreign to him, according to Skabichevsky. Some saw all this as affectation, but, the biographer wrote, \"dig deeper into the well of Pisemsky's most outrageous opinions and ideas and you'll discover bits and pieces of our ancient, now almost extinct culture, only fragments of which remain in our people.' His very appearance made one think of \"an ancient Russian peasant man who'd come through the University, learnt something about the civilization but still retained in himself most of the characteristics he had before,\" the biographer noted. Being regarded by the St. Petersburg literary society a \"coarse peasant with few social graces and a provincial accent\" didn't prevent Pisemsky from achieving a solid career in literature, and by the end of the 1850s his reputation was at its peak.\n\nIn Saint Petersburg Pisemsky made friends with Ivan Panaev, one of the editors of \"Sovremennik\", and sent him his novel \"The Rich Fiancé\", written in 1851 and satirizing characters like Rudin and Pechorin. Skabichevsky thought it was ridiculous the way the magazine which pretended to be the guiding light of the Russian intelligentsia had fallen for the \"Rich Fiancé\" where this very same intelligentsia (in the Shamilov character) was dragged through the mud. For Pisemsky, the alliance with \"Sovremennik\" felt natural, for he was indifferent towards all political parties and the Slavophile movement appealed to him as little as the ideas of the Westernizers. Annenkov wrote: \nFrom 1853 Pisemsky's life started to change. Despite his popularity he, according to Annenkov, \"was still a literary proletarian who had to count money. His house was kept in perfect order by his wife but the simplicity of it showed that the economy was forced. To improve his situation he resumed working as a governmental clerk but soon stopped.\" Pisemsky started to write less. 1854 saw the publication of \"Fanfaron\" in \"Sovremennik\", and a patriotic drama \"The Veteran and the Newcomer\" in \"Otechestvennye Zapiski\". In 1855, the latter published \"Carpenters' Cartel\" and \"Is She To Blame?\". Both enjoyed success and in his 1855 end of the year review Nikolai Chernyshevsky picked the latter as his book of the year. All of this still failed to translate into financial stability and the author openly criticized editors and publishers for exploiting their employees. He remained relatively poor up until 1861 when the publisher and entrepreneur Fyodor Stellovsky bought the rights to all of his works for 8 thousand rubles.\n\nIn 1856 Pisemsky, along with several other writers, was commissioned by the Russian Navy ministry to report on the ethnographical and commercial conditions of the Russian interior, his particular field of inquiry being Astrakhan and the region of the Caspian Sea. Critics later opined that the author hadn't been prepared for such a task and what little material he produced was \"insufferably dull and filled not with his own impressions but with fragments of other works concerning the lands he visited\" (Skabichevsky). Four of his stories appeared in 1857 in \"Morskoi Sbornik\", and \"Biblioteka Dlya Chteniya\" published three more in 1857–1860. Later they were all gathered in a book called \"Traveller's Sketches\" (Путевые очерки). 1857 saw just one short story, \"The Old Lady\", which appeared in \"Biblioteka Dlya Chtenia\", but by this time he was working on his novel \"One Thousand Souls\".\n\nPisemsky's short stories of the late 1850s and early 1860s, which dealt primarily with rural life (\"The Carpenters' Cartel\", \"Leshy\", \"The Old Man\") again demonstrated the author's utter pessimism and skepticism towards all the most fashionable ideas of his time. Neither idealizing the Russian peasantry, nor mourning its faults (both tendencies were common in Russian literature of the time), the author was critical of the Emancipation reform of 1861 which gave freedom to serfs. \"Pisemsky thought that without strong moral authority in the lead, the Russians wouldn't be able to get rid of the vices they'd acquired through centuries of slavery and state oppression; that they'd easily adapt to the new institutions and that the worst side of their national character would flourish with still greater fervency. His own life experience led him to believe that the well-being would father more vice than the misery that had initially been at the root of it,\" Annenkov wrote. According to Skabichevsky, in Pisemky's peasant stories, showing as they do a deep knowledge of common rural life, the protest against oppression was conspicuously absent which made them look as impassively objective as Émile Zola's novel \"La Terre\". \"Pisemsky's peasants, like those of Zola, are wild men driven by basic animal instincts; as all primitive men do, they combine high spiritual aspirations with beastly cruelty, often veering between these two extremes with ease,\" the biographer argued.\n\nIn the mid-1850s Pisemsky's relationship with \"Sovremennik\" started to deteriorate. On the one hand, he was uninterested in the magazine's social stance; on the other, \"Sovremennik\", although greatly respecting his talent and always ready to publish any strong piece of Pisemsky's work that came their way, were keeping their distance. One exception was Alexander Druzhinin, described as a man of \"eclectic views, a snobbish Anglophile and a follower of the 'art for art's sake' doctrine\" who was on friendly terms with the 'soil-bound' \"Moskvityanin\". To \"Sovremennik\" this was unacceptable. After the Crimean War the new \"Sovremennik\" radicals' clique removed Druzhinin from the magazine staff and he moved to \"Biblioteka Dlya Chteniya\". Upset by this, Pisemsky sent his novel \"One Thousand Souls\" (the title refers to the number of serfs a landowner had to have in order to be considered wealthy) to \"Otechestvennye Zapiski\" where it was published in 1858. In his previous works the author had dealt with local aspects of provincial life; he now endeavoured upon creating a full and damning picture of it \"highlighting atrocities which were common at the time.\" \"The history of governor Kalinovich was no worse than Saltykov-Schedrin's \"Provincial Sketches\" and easily as important,\" Skabichevsky said. The figure of Kalinovich, a man full of contradictions and conflicts, caused much controversy. Nikolay Dobrolyubov barely mentioned Pisemsky's novel in \"Sovremennik\", alleging only that \"the social side of the novel was artificially sewn to a made-up idea.\" As editor of \"Biblioteka Dlya Chtenya\", which was in decline, Druzhinin (now terminally ill with consumption) invited Pisemsky to be co-editor. From 1858–1864 the latter was the actual leader of the magazine.\n\nThe 1859 play \"A Bitter Fate\" marked another peak moment in Pisemsky's career. It was based on a real-life story which the author encountered when, as a Governor's special envoy in Kostroma, he took part in investigating a similar case. Until the emergence of Tolstoy's \"The Power of Darkness\" it remained the only drama about Russian peasant life staged in Russia. \"A Bitter Fate\" was awarded the Uvarov Prize, was staged at Alexandrinsky Theatre in 1863, and later gained the reputation of a classic of 19th century Russian drama. In 1861 his short novel \"An Old Man's Sin\" was published, arguably \"one of his gentlest and most emotional works, full of sympathy for the lead character.\"\n\nIn the mid-1850s Pisemsky was widely praised as one of the leading authors of the time, alongside Ivan Turgenev, Ivan Goncharov and Fyodor Dostoyevsky who as late as 1864, in one of his letters, referred to \"the colossal name that is Pisemsky.\" Then came his dramatic fall from grace, for which there were several reasons. One was that, as Skabichevsky noted, Pisemsky had never repudiated his 'troglodyte' mindset of a 'provincial obscurantist'; exotic in the early 1850s, it became scandalous at the end of the decade. Another had to do with the fact that people he regarded as \"crooks, whores and demagogues\" had suddenly reinvented themselves as the \"progressives\". Gradually \"Biblioteka Dlya Chtenya\", the journal he was now leading, came into a direct opposition with \"Sovremennik\". First, as Pyotr Boborykin remembered, this opposition was of a moderate character, \"at home, in his cabinet, Pisemsky spoke about this with sorrow and regret, rather than aggression\". Later biographers conceded that there had been some logic to his chagrin. \"People who came to herald such radical principles, in his eyes, should have been impeccable in every respect, which wasn't the case,\" Skabichevsky remarked.\n\nFollowing the common trend, \"Biblioteka\" started its own section for humorous sketches and feuilletons, and in 1861 Pisemsky debuted there – first as \"State councilor Salatushka\", then as Nikita Bezrylov. The latter's first feuilleton, published in the December issue and making fun of liberal trends and views, made quite a stir. In May 1862 \"Iskra\" magazine came up with a scathing retort, calling the unknown author 'dumb and ignorant', 'having by nature a very limited mind' and accusing the editor of \"Biblioteka\" of providing space for 'reactionaries'. Pisemsky, in a rather reserved way, blamed \"Iskra\" for trying to \"soil his honest name\", but then Nikita Bezrylov came up with a reply of his own which was quite a match for the \"Iskra\" article in terms of outright rudeness. \"Iskra\" editors Viktor Kurochkin and N.A. Stepanov went so far as to challenge Pisemsky to a duel, but the latter refused. The \"Russky Mir\" newspaper defended Pisemsky and published a letter of protest, signed by 30 authors. This, in its own turn, provoked \"Sovremennik\" to come up with a letter denouncing Pisemsky and signed, among others, by its leaders Nikolay Nekrasov, Nikolay Chernyshevsky and Ivan Panaev.\n\nThe scandal had a devastating effect upon Pisemsky, who \"has fallen into a state of total apathy, as he used to do in difficult times,\" according to Lev Anninsky. Retired from his position at \"Biblioteka Dlya Chtenya\", he severed all ties with literary Saint Petersburg and at the end of 1862 moved to Moscow, where he spent the rest of his life. Pisemsky worked in a hectic manner, devoting the whole of 1862 to \"Troubled Seas\". Of this book's background Pyotr Boborykin wrote: \"A journey abroad, to the London exhibition, meeting Russian émigrés there, and hearing many curious stories and anecdotes concerning the propagandists of those times confirmed Pisemsky in his decision to paint a broader picture of Russian society, and I don't doubt the sincerity with which he embarked upon this task.\" Indeed, in April 1862 Pisemsky went abroad and in June visited Alexander Herzen in London so as to explain his position towards the revolutionary democratic press. He failed to get any support, though.\n\nThe first two parts of it, Boborykin opined, might as well have been published by \"Sovremennik\"; in fact, the latter's envoys visited Pisemsky, with this in mind. \"These two parts I've heard recited by the author himself and by them nobody could have guessed that the novel would turn out to be so unpleasant for the younger generation,\" Boborykin wrote. Skabichevsky doubted the chronology, though, reminding that in the end of 1862 Pisemsky was already in Moscow. According to his theory, the novel's first two parts might have been ready by the late 1861 when, despite strained relations between the journal and the author the latter still wasn't known as 'an irreconcilable reactionary', the label it given him in early 1862. The second part, written after the break, was extraordinarily vicious in tone. In general, the novel showed Russian society in the most miserable light, as a \"sea of grief\", harbouring beneath the surface \"vile monsters and anemic fishes amongst stinking sea-weed.\" The novel, where the ugliest characters turned out to be political radicals, naturally received negative reviews, not only in the democratic press (Maxim Antonovich in \"Sovremennik\", Varfolomey Zaitsev in \"Russkoye Slovo\") but also in the centrist magazines like \"Otechestvennye Zapiski\" which denounced \"Troubled Seas\" as a rude caricature of the new generation.\n\nAfter moving to Moscow, Pisemsky joined \"The Russian Messenger\" as the head of the literary department. In 1866, on the recommendation of Interior minister Pyotr Valuyev, he became a local government councilor, the job providing him the financial independence he was craving for. Being now a well-paid author and a thrifty man, Pisemsky was able to build his fortune enough to enable him to leave work both at the magazine and the government office. In the late 1860s he bought a small piece of land on Borisoglebsky Lane in Moscow and built himself a house there. All seemed well, but only on the face of it. \"Troubled Seas\" (1863) and \"Russian Liars\" (1864) were his last critically acclaimed works. Then came the political drama \"The Warriors and Those Who Wait\" (1864) and the dramatic dilogy \"Old Birds\" (1864), and \"Birds of the Latest Gathering\" (1865), followed by the tragedy \"Men Above the Law\", as well as two historical plays, full of melodramatic turns and naturalistic elements, \"Lieutenant Gladkov\" and \"Miloslavskys and Naryshkins\" (both 1867).\n\nIn 1869 \"Zarya\" published his semi-autobiographical novel \"People of the Forties\". Its main character Vikhrov who the author associated himself with, has been found seriously wanting by critics. In 1871 \"Beseda\" published his novel \"In the Vortex\", driven by the same leitmotif: the new 'high ideals' had nothing in common with Russian practical life and were therefore worthless. According to Skabichevsky, all the post-1864 works of Pisemsky were much weaker than everything he'd written before, demonstrating \"the decline of a talent so dramatic it was unprecedented in Russian literature.\"\n\nThen followed a series of pamphlet-type dramas (\"Baal\", \"The Enlightened Times\", and \"The Financial Genius\") in which Pisemsky took it upon himself to fight the \"blight of the time\", all manner of financial misdoings. \"In the earlier years I exposed stupidity, prejudices and ignorance, ridiculed childish romanticism and empty rhetoric, fought serfdom and denounced abuses of power, documented the emergence of the first flowers of our nihilism, which has now had their fruits, and finally have taken on human kind's worst enemy, Baal, the golden calf of worship... I've also brought light to things for everybody to see: the wrong-doings of entrepreneurs and purveyors are colossal, all trade [in Russia] is based upon the most vile deceit, theft in banks is business as usual and beyond all this scum, like angels, our military men stand shining,\" he explained in a private letter.\n\nOne of his comedies, \"Saps\" (Подкопы), was so outright in its critique of higher spheres it was banned by censors. Others were staged, but enjoyed only short-lived success, having to do mostly with the sensationalist aspect, for the public could recognize in certain characters real life officials and financiers. Artistically they were flawed, and even \"The Russian Messenger\", which traditionally had supported the author, refused to publish \"The Financial Genius\". After the stage production of the play flopped, Pisemsky returned to the form of the novel and in his last 4 years produced two of them: \"The Philistines\", and \"Masons\", the later being notable for its picturesque historical background created with the help of Vladimir Solovyov. Skabichevsky described both as \"anemic and dull\", and even Ivan Turgenev, who made great efforts to cheer Pisemsky up, still noted a streak of \"tiredness\" in the author's latest prose. \"You were absolutely right: I am really tired of writing, and even more – of living. Of course old age is no fun for anybody, but for me it's especially bad and full of dark torment I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy,\" Pisemsky wrote back in a letter.\n\nLosing popularity was one of the reasons for such misery. He scolded his critics, calling them \"vipers\", but was aware that his golden days were over. Vasily Avseenko, describing Pisemsky's visit to Saint Petersburg in 1869 after the publication of \"People of the Forties\", recalled how old and tired he looked. \"I am beginning to feel like a victim of my own spleen,\" Pisemsky confessed in an August 1875 letter to Annenkov. \"I am all right physically, but cannot say the same of my mental and moral state; hypochondria torments me. I am unable to write and any mental effort makes me feel sick. Thank God the religious feeling, which is now blossoming in me, gives some respite to my suffering soul,\" Pisemsky wrote to Turgenev in the early 1870s.\n\nIn these difficult times the one person who continuously provided moral support to Pisemsky was Ivan Turgenev. In 1869 he informed Pisemsky that his \"One Thousand Souls\" had been translated into German and enjoyed \"great success in Berlin\". \"So now the time has come for you to step outside the borders of your motherland and for Aleksey Pisemsky to become a European name,\" Turgenev wrote on October 9, 1869. \"The best Berlin critic, Frenzel, in \"National Zeitung\" devoted a whole article to you where he calls your novel 'a rare phenomenon', and I tell you, now you are well known in Germany,\" wrote Turgenev in another letter, enclosing clips from other papers, too. \"The success of \"One Thousand Souls\" encourages [the translator] to start upon the novel \"Troubled Seas\" and I am so happy both for you and for Russian literature in general… Critical reviews of \"One Thousand Souls\" here in Germany are most favourable, your characters are being compared to those of Dickens, Thackeray, etc, etc\", he continued. Julian Schmidt’s large article in \"Zeitgenossensche Bilder\", part of the series devoted to first class European authors, provided for Pisemsky another cause to celebrate, and following Turgenev's advice, in 1875 he visited Schmidt to thank him personally.\n\nAnother joyful event of these final years of Pisemsky's life was the commemoration on January 19, 1875, of the 25th anniversary of his literary career. One of the speakers, the \"Beseda\" editor Sergey Yuryev, said:\n\n\"My 25 years in literature have not been easy. While fully aware of how weak and inadequate my efforts have been, I still feel like I've every reason to continue: I never came under somebody else's flag, and my writing, good or bad, it's not for me to judge, contained only what I myself felt and thought. I remained true to my own understanding of things, never violating for any fleeting reason the modest talent nature gave me. One of my guiding lights has always been my desire to tell my country the truth about itself. Whether or not I succeeded, is not for me to tell,\" Pisemsky said in reply.\n\nIn the late 1870s Pisemsky's beloved younger son Nikolai, a talented mathematician, committed suicide for reasons which were unexplained. This was a heavy blow for his father who sunk into a deep depression. In 1880 his second son Pavel, the Moscow University Law faculty docent, became fatally ill, and this finished Pisemsky off. As Annenkov remembered, he \"became bed-ridden, crushed by the weight of fits of pessimism and hypochondria which became more frequent after his family's catastrophe. His widow said later she never suspected that the end was near and thought the bout would pass, dissolving as it used to into physical weakness and melancholy. But this one proved to be the last for the tormented Pisemsky, who lost all willingness to resist.\"\n\nOn January 21, 1881, Pisemsky died, only a week before the death of Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Whereas the latter's funeral in Saint Petersburg became a grandiose event, Pisemsky's burial went unnoticed. Of well-known authors only Alexander Ostrovsky was present. In 1885 the Wolf Publishing House issued an edition of the \"Complete Pisemsky\" in 24 volumes. Pisemsky's personal archive was destroyed by fire. His house was later demolished. Borisoglebsky Lane, where he spent his last years, was renamed Pisemsky Street in the Soviet times.\n\nPisemsky's first romantic affairs, according to his autobiography, concerned various cousins. After the University, he developed an interest in what he termed \"George Sandean free love\" but soon became disillusioned and decided to marry, \"selecting for this purpose a girl not of a coquettish type, coming from a good, even if not wealthy family,\" namely Yekaterina Pavlovna Svinyina, daughter of Pavel Svinyin, the founder of \"Otechestvennye Zapiski\" magazine. They married on October 11, 1848. \"My wife is portrayed partially in \"Troubled Seas\", as Evpraxia, who's also nicknamed Ledeshka (Piece of Ice),\" he wrote. This was a practical marriage without any romantic passion involved, yet a fortunate one for Pisemsky, for, according to many people who knew her, Svinyina was a woman of rare virtues. \"This exceptional woman proved able to calm down his sick hypochondria, and free him not only from all the domestic obligations involved in bringing up children, but also from her own meddling into his private affairs, which were full of whims and rush impulses. Besides, she re-wrote by her own hand no less than two thirds of his original manuscripts which invariably looked like crooked, indecipherable scribbling furnished with ink-blots,\" wrote Pavel Annenkov.\n\nBiographer Semyon Vengerov quoted a source who knew Pisemsky closely as having called Yekaterina Pavlovna \"a perfect literary wife who took very close to her heart all the literary anxieties and troubles of her husband, all the jigsaws of his creative career, cherishing his talent and doing whatever was possible to keep him in conditions favourable to the development of his talent. Add to all this a rare leniency, of which she had to have a great deal of, to put up with Aleksey, who occasionally demonstrated qualities not congenial with being a family man.\" Ivan Turgenev, in one of his letters, imploring Pisemsky to get rid of this spleen of his, wrote: \"I think I've told you this once, but I might as well repeat it. Do not forget that in the lottery of life you've won a major prize: you have an excellent wife and nice children...\"\n\nAccording to Lev Anninsky, Pisemsky's personal mythology \"revolved around one word: fear.\" Biographers reproduced numerous anecdotes about him being scared of sailing and other things, and how he was often 'stuck on the front porch of his house, uncertain whether he should enter: thinking that robbers were there, or somebody had died, or a fire had started'. Quite striking were his extraordinary collection of phobias and fears, along with general hypochondria.\" In an 1880 letter to photographer Konstantin Shapiro who had recently published his gallery of Russian writers he confessed: \"My portrait repeats the one flaw which all of my photographic portraits have, my not knowing how to pose. In all of my photographs my eyes come out goggled and frightened and even somewhat mad, maybe because as they put me facing the camera obscura, I do experience – if not fear, then strong anxiety.\"\n\nPeople who knew Pisemsky personally remembered him warmly, as a man whose weaknesses were outweighed by virtues, of which a keen sense of justice, good humour, honesty, and modesty were the most obvious. According to Arkady Gornfeld, \"His whole character, from the inability to understand foreign cultures to ingenuousness, humour, keenness of remarks and common sense – was that of a simple, if very clever, Russian muzhik. His main personal feature became a major literary asset: truthfulness, sincerity, total lack of the faults of pre-Gogol literature, like over-intensity and eagerness to say something that was beyond the author's understanding,\" he remarked in his essay on Gogol. Pavel Annenkov wrote of Pisemsky:\n\nContemporary critics differed greatly in trying to classify Pisemsky's prose or assess his position in Russian literature. In retrospect, this position altered dramatically with the times and, as critic and biographer Lev Anninsky noted, while Melnikov-Pechersky or Nikolai Leskov have always been far from the literary mainstream, Pisemsky spent some time as a 'first rank' author and was praised as an 'heir to Gogol' in the course of the 1850s, then dropped from the elite to slide into almost total oblivion which lasted for decades. According to Anninsky, \"more daring critics drew a parallel with Gogol... whose final years sort of pre-dated the future drama of Pisemsky: breaking away from the 'progressive Russia', the 'betrayal' and the ostracism that followed. But Russia's forgiven Gogol everything: the pose of an angry prophet, the second volume of \"Dead Souls\", those 'reactionary' passages from \"The Chosen Fragments of Correspondence with Friends\". As for Pisemsky, Russia refused to forgive him a single thing,\" the critic argued.\n\nHaving entered the Russian literary scene when it was dominated by the Natural School, Pisemsky has been regarded as arguably its most notable proponent. This wasn't obvious to many of his contemporaries, though; both Pavel Annenkov and Alexander Druzhinin (critics of different camps) argued that Pisemsky's earlier works were not only foreign to the Natural School, but stood in direct opposition to it. Apollon Grigoriev (who in 1852 wrote: \"The Muff is the... artistic antidote to the sickly rubbish the 'Natural School' authors produce\") went even further ten years later, stating in \"Grazhdanin\" that Pisemsky with his \"low-brow wholesomeness\" was far more important to Russian literature than Goncharov (with his \"affected nods to narrow-minded pragmatism\"), Turgenev (who \"surrendered to all false values\") and even Leo Tolstoy (who had \"made his way to artlessness in the most artful manner\").\n\nIn the 1850s, concentrating on the everyday life of the small-scale provincial Russian, Pisemsky recreated this world as totally devoid of romantic features. \"He mercilessly destroyed the poetic aura of 'noblemen’s nests' that was created by Tolstoy and Turgenev,\" recreating the life of the community where all relations looked ugly and \"real love was always losing to cool flirting or open deceit,\" biographer Viduetskaya wrote. On the other hand, in \"picturing the Russian muzhik, and being the master of reproducing the language of the lower classes, Pisemsky had no equals; after him a return to the type of peasant novel created by Grigorovich became unthinkable\", critic A. Gornfeld argued. As D. S. Mirsky put it in his 1926 \"History of Russian Literature\", \"Like others among the Russian realists, Pisemsky is gloomy rather than otherwise but again in a different way – his gloom is nothing like Turgenev's hopeless surrender to the mysterious forces of the universe, but a hearty and virile disgust at the vileness of the majority of mankind and at the futility in particular of the Russian educated classes.\"\n\nThe inability of contemporary critics to sum up Pisemsky in a more or less congruous manner, according to Anninsky, might be explained by the fact that the world of Pisemsky (for whom \"artistic intuition was the instrument of logic\") was \"rough and soft, unprepossessing and vulnerable\", open to all manner of interpretations. The ground that Pisemsky stood on, as Anninsky saw it, was doomed from the start: stronger authors (Tolstoy and Turgenev, in particular) entered the scene, created new, more interesting characters, re-worked this soil and made it their own.\n\nAccording to Viduetskaya, Pisemsky's original driving force was negativism which had been played out by the early 1860s. Seeing as the peak of his post-reform legacy the cycle \"Russian Liars\" (1865), the critic considers Pisemsky the novelist a marginal force in Russian literature, admitting, though, that writers like Dmitry Mamin-Sibiryak and Alexander Sheller were among his followers. But as a short story writer he might be considered as a predecessor to such masters of the form as Leskov and Chekhov, Viduetskaya suggested. According to D. S. Mirsky, \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1962191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962191", "title": "KRON-TV", "text": "KRON-TV\n\nKRON-TV, virtual channel 4 (VHF digital channel 7), is a MyNetworkTV-affiliated television station licensed to San Francisco, California, United States, and serving the San Francisco Bay Area. The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group. KRON-TV maintains studios on Front Street immediately west of San Francisco's Embarcadero north of the city's Financial District, in the same building as ABC owned-and-operated station (O&O) KGO-TV, channel 7 (but with completely separate operations from that station). The transmitting antenna, shared with Fox O&O KTVU (channel 2) and CBS O&O KPIX-TV (channel 5), is located atop the Sutro Tower near San Francisco's Twin Peaks. \n\nKRON-TV is the second largest MyNetworkTV affiliate by market size that is not owned and operated by the Fox Television Stations subsidiary of Fox Corporation, which owns the programming service.\n\nIn the 1940s, when the channel 4 allocation in the Bay Area came open for bidding, it soon became clear that the license would go to either NBC or the deYoung family, publishers of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" daily newspaper. NBC wanted an owned-and-operated station (O&O) in the Bay Area alongside its West Coast flagship radio station, KNBC (680 AM, now KNBR). However, in an upset, the deYoungs won the license. KRON-TV signed on the air on November 15, 1949, as a full-time NBC affiliate, operated alongside co-owned radio station KRON-FM (96.5, now KOIT-FM). The station's call letters come from a modification of the \"Chronicle\"s nickname, \"The Chron\". KRON-TV was the third television outlet in the Bay Area behind KGO-TV (channel 7) and KPIX-TV (channel 5), all going on the air within a year, and the last license before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) placed a moratorium on new television station licenses that would last the next four years.\n\nKRON-TV originally broadcast from studios located in the basement of the Chronicle Building at Fifth and Mission Streets. Newscasts benefited from the resources of the \"Chronicle\" and there was cooperation between KRON-TV and the newspaper. It originally maintained transmitter facilities, master control and a small insert studio on San Bruno Mountain. \"NBC\" lettering was placed near the summit of Radio Peak in huge white letters. In August 1959, the \"Chronicle\" reported that the tower was severely damaged by an unusually strong thunderstorm, requiring major repairs before KRON-TV could return to the air. In 1961, NBC attempted to purchase its own station in the Bay Area, when they attempted to buy KTVU. The sale was cancelled that October due to pre-existing concerns over the sale cited by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that were related to NBC's ownership of radio and television stations in Philadelphia; as a result, NBC stayed with KRON-TV.\n\nIn 1967, KRON-FM-TV moved to a new studio at 1001 Van Ness Avenue in the Western Addition neighborhood (a location that formerly served as the site of the Roman Catholic cathedral of San Francisco). The television transmitter was moved to Sutro Tower on July 4, 1973, while the FM transmitter remained on San Bruno Mountain.\n\nSince the 1970s, KRON's logo has incorporated a stylized number \"4\" design that is based on the Golden Gate Bridge. The vertical component is a bridge tower, the horizontal component is a portion of the bridge deck, and the curve is a portion of a suspension cable. This logo was used as early as April 1974, during coverage of a Symbionese Liberation Army bank robbery. By about 1991, this evolved into the \"circle 4\" logo in use to this day, with the \"4\" keeping the bridge design.\n\nIn 1982, the deYoung family's Chronicle Publishing Company unit discussed a possible trade of KRON-TV to the Gannett Company (whose broadcasting division is now part of Tegna) in exchange for acquiring Gannett's Oklahoma City station KOCO-TV, plus an additional $100 million. The proposal ultimately fell apart by September 1983.\n\nOn June 16, 1999, the deYoung family announced the liquidation of Chronicle Publishing's assets. By this point, the deYoungs owned three television stations (including KRON) in large and mid-sized media markets around the country, two of which were sold off to LIN TV (which traded KAKE-TV in Wichita and WOWT in Omaha to Benedek Broadcasting in turn). The \"San Francisco Chronicle\", meanwhile, was acquired by the Hearst Corporation in a $295 million deal in October of that year.\n\nNBC had made many offers for channel 4 over the years, but the deYoungs turned them down each time. It finally saw the opportunity to get an owned-and-operated station in what was then the United States' fifth-largest television market and quickly jumped into the bidding war for KRON. NBC was seen as the frontrunner to buy the station, but it was outbid at the last minute on November 16, 1999. KRON was bought by New York City-based Young Broadcasting, then-owner of Los Angeles independent station KCAL-TV and several other stations in medium to small markets. Young's purchase price for the station ($750 million at the outset, rising to $820 million by closing) was a record price for a single station that stands to this day. To help finance the down payment, Young was forced to sell La Crosse, Wisconsin, CBS affiliate WKBT to Morgan Murphy Media.\n\nNBC president and chief executive officer Bob Wright had warned that if NBC did not succeed in buying KRON, it would require any prospective buyer to uphold specific terms if it wanted to retain the NBC affiliation. Wright did not rule out moving NBC's Bay Area affiliation elsewhere. When Young closed on its purchase of channel 4, NBC made good on these threats by demanding that Young operate KRON under the same conventions as an NBC owned-and-operated outlet. Among other things, it demanded that KRON change its on-air name to \"NBC 4\" and run the network's entire schedule in pattern (reducing primetime preemptions due to local programming from 20 hours to five hours a year). Preemptions would \"only\" be permitted for extended breaking news or severe weather coverage. NBC also demanded yearly payments of $10 million from Young, a form of reverse compensation, flipping around the then-normal mode of networks paying their affiliates for their airtime. (In turn, NBC would stop making annual payments to KRON of $7.5 million to carry the network's programming.) Young would also have to give NBC the first option on the programming of additional subchannels on the station's digital signal.\n\nRather than give in to NBC's demands, Young decided not to renew channel 4's affiliation contract, which was set to expire at the beginning of 2002. San Jose-based KNTV channel 11 approached NBC with a proposal to pay $37 million annually for the rights to broadcast its programming. In 1999, KNTV joined The WB in conjunction with the network's existing Bay Area affiliate, then co-owned KBWB (channel 20, now KOFY-TV). KNTV agreed to drop its ABC affiliation at the behest of network-owned KGO-TV, the market's primary ABC station. NBC accepted KNTV's deal in February 2000. It did so primarily as a stopgap in case NBC failed in its bid to buy KRON from Young. \n\nHowever, Young's asking price for the station was $735 million, only slightly less than what it paid to buy the station from Chronicle. NBC felt that price was too high, and walked away from the deal when Young refused to lower it. In December 2001, NBC purchased KNTV from Granite Broadcasting for a fraction of KRON's sale price of $230 million. That made NBC the only major broadcast network to have switched from one Bay Area station to another. The last NBC program to be broadcast by channel 4 was a repeat episode of \"Crossing Jordan\", at 10:00 p.m. on December 31, 2001. KNTV officially joined NBC later that evening at 11:35 p.m. with the regular broadcast of \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\". That ended KRON-TV's 52-year affiliation with the NBC network.\n\nWith ABC, CBS, UPN and now NBC carrying their programming locally on owned-and-operated stations (KGO-TV, KPIX, KBHK—channel 44, now KBCW—and KNTV respectively), and Fox and The WB under contract with KTVU and KBWB respectively, KRON-TV became an independent station by default. The station filled time slots formerly occupied by NBC shows with syndicated programming and expanded newscasts. The NBC Network was near the top of the ratings nationally at the time of the disaffiliation, due to strong shows such as \"Friends\", \"Frasier\", \"Law & Order\" and \"ER\". Without those NBC shows, KRON's ratings started to decline. The viewership of its newscasts began to fall substantially by the time the station regained a network affiliation.\n\nOn February 22, 2006, News Corporation announced the launch of MyNetworkTV. The network was created partly in response to CBS Corporation and Time Warner's January 24 announcement that UPN and The WB would be shut down and replaced with the jointly-owned CW Television Network. (CBS-owned UPN affiliate KBHK, whose call sign became KBCW by the network's launch, was named The CW's Bay Area affiliate. WB affiliate KBWB became an independent station). KRON-TV became a MyNetworkTV affiliate when it debuted on September 5, 2006. (It is currently one of the largest MyNetworkTV-affiliated stations not to previously have been an affiliate of either The WB or UPN, second only to the network's Dallas O&O KDFI.) \n\nKRON began branding itself as \"MyKRON 4\" for MyNetworkTV programming, although it continues to promote itself as \"KRON 4\" outside of the service's programming hours. After joining MyNetworkTV, the station moved its hour-long 9 p.m. newscast to 8 p.m. It chose to run the fledgling network's programming from 9 to 11 p.m., one hour later than MyNetworkTV's standard 8 to 10 p.m. scheduling in the Pacific Time Zone.\n\nOn January 10, 2008, Young Broadcasting announced it would sell KRON-TV. The company had been encountering difficulties in meeting interest payments on its outstanding debt. Young's stock, which had been trading for a few cents per share, was ultimately delisted from NASDAQ in January 2009, after failing to meet the minimum standards for being on the exchange. One month later on February 13, Young made a filing to place the company under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Debt incurred from its 1999 purchase of KRON was believed to be one key factor behind the company's cash problems. Young originally hoped to close a sale of the station by the end of the first quarter of 2008, but no buyer emerged.\n\nOn February 13, 2009, the company declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At the last minute, Young cancelled a planned auction of all 10 of its stations five months later on July 14, a move believed to have been made due to a lack of suitable bids. Instead of auctioning off the stations, Young and its secured lenders reached a deal where the lenders (among them Wachovia and Credit Suisse) would take control of the company, and Gray Television would manage seven of Young's ten stations. KRON, WATE-TV in Knoxville, Tennessee, and WLNS-TV in Lansing, Michigan (the latter two, unlike KRON, compete with Gray-owned stations in their respective markets), were the only stations not included in the management deal.\n\nIn February 2010, Young discussed the possibility of entering into a shared services agreement (SSA) with KNTV's owner NBCUniversal. That year, KRON informally reunited with NBC as it began to carry network programs during sports programming and breaking news events that force their preemptions on KNTV. (This responsibility as a backup NBC affiliate was assumed by KICU-TV in 2012.)\n\nStation management announced at a November 2011 meeting that no such agreement would take place, and that KRON would instead relocate to a smaller, state-of-the-art facility within the next year to year-and-a-half. A week later, it was also announced the station's master control operations would be operated remotely from Atlanta beginning in mid-January 2012. The move to new studios, and plans to operate master control from Atlanta, were scrapped by June 2012.\n\nOn June 6, 2013, Media General announced it would acquire Young Broadcasting in an all-stock deal. The merger was completed on November 12, 2013. The move made KRON-TV the largest station by market size owned by Media General as well as the company's only station west of the Rocky Mountains. (Most of Media General's television stations were in the Southeastern, Midwestern and Northeastern United States.)\n\nOn February 10, 2014, Media General announced that KRON-TV would move into leased space on the third floor of KGO-TV's building (ABC Broadcast Center) at 900 Front Street, in space formerly occupied by radio stations KGO and KSFO. KRON-TV's studios at 1001 Van Ness Avenue would be put up for sale. Despite the co-location, KRON-TV maintains separate broadcast facilities from KGO-TV and employs a completely separate staff. Each station's employees are restricted by keycards from entering the other's facilities.\n\nIn June 2014, Fox Television Stations announced it would acquire KTVU and KICU-TV in a trade with Cox Media Group in exchange for that company's stations in Boston and Memphis. Prior to the announcement it was rumored that Fox had considered buying KRON-TV and moving Fox network programming to channel 4. (Had Fox actually acquired KRON-TV, this would have made it one of the two major networks in the Bay Area, along with NBC, to switch from one station to another.) Fox completed its acquisition of KTVU and KICU-TV on October 8, 2014; despite MyNetworkTV being operated by Fox Television Stations, , KRON-TV remains an affiliate of the service. \n\nOn January 27, 2016, Nexstar Broadcasting Group announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire Media General. The transaction was consummated on January 17, 2017, and with it, KRON became part of the Nexstar Media Group.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nIn October 2007, the Retro Television Network (RTV) was expected to launch as a digital subchannel on KRON-DT2 as part of a test of the network by Young Broadcasting, along with sister stations WBAY-TV/Green Bay, Wisconsin, and WTEN/Albany, New York. However, KRON never carried the network. KRON carried traffic conditions on channel 4.3. (RTV is currently carried in the market by KAXT-CD.) Eventually, after the digital transition and widescreen upgrades, KRON's HD channel was moved to the main 4.1 channel.\n\nIn late 2010, Young announced an affiliation deal with The Country Network for several of its stations, including KRON. However like with RTV, TCN was never carried by the station, and the network was dropped from all of New Young Broadcasting's stations by November 2011.\n\nLikewise, KRON was by default not made part of Young's carriage of the Disney-owned Live Well Network on its stations, due to the network's carriage on the second and third digital subchannels of Disney-owned ABC O&O KGO-TV.\n\nKRON 4.2 was originally a 24/7 news channel.\n\nOn September 29, 2015, Sky Link TV, a 24/7 Chinese language TV network, launched on channel 4.2, replacing the news channel.\n\nOn August 19, 2013, KRON became the San Francisco affiliate for Tribune Broadcasting's Antenna TV classic television network. Antenna TV was added to digital subchannel 4.3.\n\nBecause former station owner Media General has signed an affiliation agreement with getTV, KRON 4.3 became an affiliate of that network on May 1, 2016.\n\nKRON-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 4, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's pre-transition digital signal had been on UHF channel 57, which was among the high band UHF channels (52–69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition. The digital signal was moved to UHF channel 38. Using PSIP, KRON-TV's virtual channel is displayed as channel 4 on digital television receivers.\n\nBayTV debuted on July 4, 1994, as a 24-hour cable news channel that was operated by KRON-TV in association with AT&T Broadband (now Comcast Xfinity). BayTV was carried on cable channel 35. The KRON news staff also provided local news updates on MSNBC and CNN Headline News on Bay Area cable systems during this period. KRON's now-defunct 9 p.m. newscast originally debuted on BayTV in the late 1990s and lasted until the cable channel ceased operations on August 30, 2001. The 9 p.m. newscast was revived on channel 4 following KRON-TV's transition to an independent station in January 2002, though it was moved to 8 p.m. when it affiliated with MyNetworkTV on September 5, 2006. The channel's daily Silicon Valley news recap \"New Media News\" also aired nationally on Jones Media Group cable channel Mind Extension University/Knowledge TV until that channel shut down in 2000.\n\nOn July 26, 2012, KRON launched another 24-hour local news and weather channel, called the KRON 4 24/7 Bay Area News Channel. The channel featured news, local weather and traffic updates using the common screen template and setup shared among all of Young's automated weather/news information subchannels. Unlike the cable-exclusive BayTV, it was carried locally on over-the-air digital subchannel 4.2, on cable through Comcast Xfinity channel 193, and was streamed on KRON's website. The over-the-air channel was replaced by Sky Link TV on September 29, 2015, and the online live stream was shut down on the same date.\n\nUntil the late 1970s, KRON-TV was known for being very San Francisco-centric in its news coverage and audience targeting, an approach that would become costly to the station as population growth in areas outside San Francisco soared. Realizing this and refocusing on the entire market enabled KRON-TV to become the dominant station in the Bay Area. \n\nDuring the 1980s, KRON continued its dominance by airing top-rated syndicated programs, including the Merv Griffin-produced game shows \"Jeopardy!\" and \"Wheel of Fortune\" (the original NBC daytime versions of both series also aired on KRON), as well as \"Entertainment Tonight\". The game show pair would move to ABC-owned KGO-TV permanently in 1992 after KRON-TV experimented with its \"early prime time\" schedule that year, while \"ET\" also moved to KGO in 1988, before returning to KRON in 1992 (where the show has remained since).\n\nOther syndicated programming currently airing on KRON-TV includes \"Dr. Phil\", \"Inside Edition\" and \"The Doctors\".\n\nFor most of its tenure with NBC, KRON was the network's second-largest affiliate (behind only KYW-TV in Philadelphia) and its largest on the West Coast. Despite this, KRON occasionally preempted NBC programming. One such notable omission was \"Another World\", which would eventually air on the station in the early 1990s; KRON's decision to drop the daytime soap opera in the summer of 1998 (leaving \"Days of Our Lives\" and the struggling \"Sunset Beach\" as the only network soaps on its schedule) is thought to have hastened NBC's decision to cancel it altogether a year later. Two NBC daytime game shows, \"50 Grand Slam\" and \"Just Men!\", were never seen in the Bay Area. KRON also did not air NBC's soap operas in pattern (for example, KRON-TV aired \"Days of Our Lives\" after \"Another World\", rather than the standard slot for NBC affiliates in the Pacific Time Zone—at 2:00 or 3:00 p.m. depending on the season and time slot). Channel 4 also preempted some of the network's prime time programs. Similar to fellow NBC station KCRA-TV in neighboring Sacramento, KRON-TV stopped airing the Saturday morning \"T-NBC\" lineup in the early 1990s. Historically, NBC was far less tolerant of preemptions than the other networks, but has recently eased its standards. The network would resort to purchasing stations for the sole purpose of switching or upgrading them to O&O status because of this (Miami's WTVJ and Salt Lake City's KUTV are such examples) or would find independent stations to air NBC programs that the main affiliate did not air. In the case of KRON, many of the shows it preempted ended up on independent KICU-TV. NBC had a somewhat contentious relationship with KRON, especially since it often lost valuable advertising in one of the nation's largest markets. However, it had little reason to complain about its ratings performance in the Bay Area, as channel 4 was one of NBC's strongest affiliates for the better part of a half-century. A shuffle of network affiliations around the country (and NBC's acquisition of some stations in markets larger than San Francisco) in the mid-1990s made channel 4 NBC's largest affiliate.\n\nDuring the 1992–1993 season, KRON-TV, along with KCRA-TV, participated in the \"Early Prime\" experiment in which prime time programs aired one hour earlier (mirroring the scheduling of the network's primetime lineup in the Central and Mountain time zones), the half-hour late evening newscast also moved from 11:00 to 10:00 p.m. as a result. While KRON moved NBC's prime time programming back to the 8:00–11:00 p.m. timeslot in September 1993, CBS affiliate KPIX, who adopted the early primetime schedule at the same time as KRON, continued with the experiment until 1998–well after it had become owned by the network through CBS's 1994 acquisition by KPIX's then-owner Westinghouse. Though both KRON and KPIX ran hour-long newscasts at 10 p.m., neither were able to beat Fox affiliate KTVU, due to that station's longtime dominance in the 10 o'clock hour that continues to this day.\n\nIn 1965, KRON-TV began broadcasting most Oakland Raiders games, which were at first part of the American Football League, which had a contract with NBC from 1965 to 1969, and then the National Football League's American Football Conference, which inherited the AFL's deal with NBC from 1970 to 1997 (the Raiders relocated to Los Angeles in 1982, stripping KRON of its status as the team's home station until they returned to Oakland in 1995; the station then served as the unofficial home station until 1997). KRON aired coverage of the Raiders' victories in Super Bowl XI and Super Bowl XV. In 2020, KRON-TV became the now Las Vegas Raiders official Bay Area home station for pre-season games and special programming.\n\nIn addition, during those same years (1970–1997), KRON-TV also aired select San Francisco 49ers games whenever they played host to an AFC opponent at Candlestick Park (the station aired the team's victory in Super Bowl XXIII in January 1989).\n\nIn 1993, Channel 4 became the flagship station of the Oakland Athletics, after acquiring broadcast rights to the Major League Baseball team's games. This caused a problem in 1996, when the final day of the U.S. Olympic track and field trials conflicted with a scheduled Athletics broadcast. Since KRON-TV was contractually obligated to show the baseball game live, it rebroadcast the trials at midnight. KRON lost the Athletics' television rights following the team's 1998 season. Both select Oakland A's and San Francisco Giants games were aired as part of NBC's broadcast contract with Major League Baseball from 1957 to 1989, including the A's string of three consecutive World Series victories in 1972, 1973, and 1974.\n\nFrom 1989 until January 2008, KRON-TV produced a countdown program called \"New Year's Live\", which aired on New Year's Eve (sometimes beginning at 11 p.m.) and continued into New Year's Day (sometimes ending at 1 a.m.). Events in San Francisco were the focal point of KRON's coverage, especially the midnight fireworks show near the Ferry Building. Other West Coast television stations joined KRON in some years (including KCAL-TV/Los Angeles, KING-TV/Seattle, KCRA/Sacramento, KNSD/San Diego and KLAS-TV/Las Vegas in December 1990), featuring midnight countdown events in other cities, such as Las Vegas casinos and at the Seattle Space Needle. Former KRON weather anchor Mark Thompson served as the host during the program's early years. \"New Year's Live\" returned to KRON in December 2010 as an hour-long broadcast, hosted by Catherine Heenan and George Rask in-studio, with live reports from Henry Tenenbaum at Pier 39 and Vicki Liviakis at Waterbar on the Embarcadero. Starting in 2011, Gary Radnich joined Heenan as host at various locations in San Francisco each year.\n\nKRON-TV also produces two locally-produced programs outside of local newscasts: \"Bay Area Living – Home Improvement Edition\" and \"Bay Area Bargains\". Past local programs include \"Bay Area Backroads\", \"Bay Cafe\", \"Henry's Home & Garden\", \"Latin Eyes\", \"Pacific Fusion\", \"The Silver Lining\"; and several series and featured news segments that were developed by Jim Swanson, executive producer including \"Bay Area Bargains – Green Edition\"; \"Bay Area Living – Seniors Edition\"; \"KRON 4's Body Beautiful\"; \"KRON 4's Casino Adventures\"; \"Don't Invest and Forget\"; \"Health and Beauty with Dr Sonia\"; \"Living Green with Petersen Dean\"; \"KRON 4's Medical Mondays\"; \"KRON 4's Peninsula Beauty\"; \"KRON 4's Sizzling Hot Auto Deals\" and \"KRON 4's Spa Spectacular\".\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, local programs produced by KRON-TV included the award-winning documentary series \"Assignment Four\", \"Fireman Frank\" with George Lemont (died October 1985 at the age of 63) and his puppets (including Scat the Cat, Rhode Island Red, and Karl the Karrot), and a live children's program hosted by Art Finley as \"Mayor Art.\" Bay Area kids, known as the \"City Council,\" joined Mayor Art in the studio each day. The show featured \"Popeye\" cartoons mixed with science demonstrations, a newsreel feature entitled \"Mayor Art's Almanac\", games, prizes, and a sock puppet named \"Ring-A-Ding.\"\n\n\"Assignment Four\" was a documentary series that generally aired Monday evenings at 7:00 p.m. through much of the 1960s (beginning in February 1960). A promotional brochure declared, \"each \"Assignment Four\" story is concerned with cultural and ethnic activities or perhaps some fascinating phase of life and living in the Greater San Francisco Bay Area.\" Subjects ranged from 'Skid Row' to 'The Single Girl,' the 'Green Intricate Country of Napa Valley' to 'No Deposit, No Return' (a study of garbage disposal that won a 1966 Emmy Award and Silver Medal Award in the 1966 New York International Film Festival). The documentary 'Not to Have Lived' (aired January 31, 1966) about mechanized society featured no dialogue or narration.\n\nIn the late 1980s, KRON-TV was among the few local television stations in the United States that produced a game show: \"Claim to Fame\", a weekly half-hour program hosted by Patrick Van Horn that usually ran on Saturday evenings. During that timeframe, KRON also produced a Saturday morning children's program called \"Buster and Me\". From the 1970s into the late 1980s, the station used Gabriel Fauré's \"Pavane\", Opus 50 as the music played during its nightly sign-off, alongside scenic rustic shots from around the Bay Area. KRON also produced \"Bay Area Backroads\", a half-hour program (which ran from the mid-1980s to 2008) that profiled places and people in the greater San Francisco Bay Area, and occasionally beyond. The program, which generally aired on Sunday evenings, featured hosts such as Jerry Graham and Doug McConnell.\n\nKRON presently broadcasts 65 hours of local newscasts each week (with 11 hours each weekday and five hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). KRON is one of two remaining MyNetworkTV affiliate that airs and produces its own newscasts, alongside Philadelphia affiliate WPHL-TV (Though only a morning newscast, while its 10:00 PM newscast is produced by WPVI-TV), after the service's Secaucus, New Jersey, owned-and-operated station WWOR-TV (whose news department operated separately from Fox-owned sister station WNYW stemming from license requirements imposed by WWOR's 1983 license transfer from New York City to New Jersey) closed theirs in July 2013.\n\nKRON's news operations were handled by the \"Chronicle\" until it launched its own news department in September 1957. It operated from a studio inside the \"Chronicle\" building at Fifth & Mission streets (the station's news department was located 30 feet from the \"Chronicle\" city desk). Appropriately for a station once owned by the \"Chronicle\", KRON-TV has long been a very news-intensive station. it produced six daily newscasts at the time, including the Shell-sponsored 6 p.m. newscast \"Shell News\", with Tom Franklin reporting from the studio at the \"Chronicle\" and in filmed field reports. Franklin began the broadcast standing next to a map of the San Francisco Bay Area, with lights illuminated on the map next to the various cities that the newscast was to feature stories from. Franklin anchored most of the program from behind a desk that had a large Shell logo next to a \"Tom Franklin\" nameplate, with a Shell \"X-100\" oil can that sat atop the desk. Live segments were used for late bulletins from the \"Chronicle\" city desk or for local and regional stories not suitable for film treatment. Some of the stories covered by \"Shell News\" in 1957 included the end of the \"pedestrian scramble\" system at downtown San Francisco street intersections, the end of the San Francisco-Oakland Southern Pacific railroad passenger ferry and the final game of the San Francisco Seals baseball team (to be replaced by the San Francisco Giants in 1958). In the 1960s, KRON-TV had anchors Art Brown and Jerry Jensen (who later moved to KGO-TV), and Linda Richards, who wrote predicted temperatures backwards on sliding glass panels with maps drawn on them, for viewers to see the weather forecast. Ed Hart, and later Frank Dill, reported sports with a focus on only the area's professional teams. KRON's early morning news digests in the 1960s utilized sign language by Peter Wechsberg and Jane Norman.\n\nKRON-TV eventually branded its newscasts as \"Newswatch 4\" in the early 1970s. By early 1972, the station ran newscasts at noon, 5:30, 6:30 and 11 p.m. on weekdays and 6 and 11 p.m. on weekends, it also ran a late newscast that aired (then) immediately after \"The Tonight Show\" called the \"Newswatch Sign-Off Edition\". Presenters then included Terry Lowry, Phil Wilson, Karna Small, Bob Marsden, Paul Ryan, Art Brown and Dave Valentine. The station's newscasts were branded as \"NewsCenter 4\" from 1977 until 2001, when it was changed to the current \"KRON 4 News\". A major change in KRON-TV's evening news broadcasts occurred on April 6, 1981, when the station launched the 90-minute newscast \"Live on 4\" (from 4 to 5:30 p.m.). \"NBC Nightly News\" also moved from 7 to 5:30 p.m. (KPIX and KGO would follow this move with their national newscasts during the following decade). From late 1981 to late 1988, the 5 p.m. weekday newscast was \"Live at Five\"; Bob Jimenez anchored in the studio with Evan White in the newsroom. \"Live on 4\" was replaced in 1983 with \"T.G.I.4\", an hour-long light local news and interview program co-hosted by Jan Rasmusson and Patrick Van Horn. In the mid-1980s, KRON-TV produced and aired an afternoon talk program called \"Bay City Limits\".\n\nIn 1981, KRON launched its first morning newscast with a seven-minute program (at 6:53 a.m.), the program was cancelled by late 1982. All the evening newscasts featured a variety of anchors, until settling down with the successful duo of Roz Abrams and Jim Paymar. After Abrams left for New York City's WABC-TV in 1986, Paymar co-anchored alongside Sylvia Chase (who had been a correspondent for CBS News and later for the ABC newsmagazine \"20/20\"). The station debuted what was then the only local early morning newscast in the San Francisco television market on September 1, 1986, with the launch of \"Daybreak\" (which ran from 6:30 to 7 a.m., leading into \"Today\"). The first anchors were Lloyd Patterson and Lila Petersen.\n\nKRON's newscasts during the 1980s regularly featured commentaries by Wayne Shannon in a segment called \"Just 4 You\", many of which had a humorous tone. Shannon received billing in newscast introductions along with the anchors, and weather and sports presenters. Another staple of KRON-TV newscasts in the 1980s was live traffic reports and news coverage from the station's helicopter \"Telecopter 4.\" Bob McCarthy, Rita Cohen and Janice Huff were among the personalities who reported from Telecopter 4. Their traffic reports appeared regularly on \"Daybreak\", during \"Today\" and \"Live at Five\". Evocative of his folksy, down-to-earth style, McCarthy had a catchphrase, \"hunky snarky\", that he often used to characterize roads on which traffic was flowing smoothly. Will Prater was the main pilot of Telecopter 4 in its early years and Lou Calderon was the main photographer. KRON also broadcast from remote locations during this era (e.g., Super Bowl venues) via a satellite uplink unit dubbed \"Newstar 4\". These segments often began with an animation depicting a signal originating from the uplink location, bouncing off a satellite and ending at a satellite dish next to the words \"San Francisco.\" KRON-TV regarded the satellite truck as a major competitive advantage over rival television stations, featuring it in a mid-1980s promotional spot which declared, \"We got a mobile satellite up-link. They don't.\"\n\nIn the 1980s, KRON-TV produced lengthy analysis pieces for the \"Cover Story\" segment on its 6 p.m. newscast, many with an investigative journalism focus and sometimes produced by the 10-person \"Target 4\" investigative unit. The station reran some of these segments in an occasional program called \"Cover Story Magazine\". The station also produced a half-hour public affairs program on Sunday mornings called \"Weekend Extra\", which was hosted by Belva Davis and Rollin Post. This program frequently presented features from KRON's news bureaus in Washington, D.C. and Sacramento, the only Bay Area station to maintain bureaus (which were later deemed to be too expensive and were shut down by the end of the decade). During this time, KRON news grew rapidly in viewership and collected a large number of awards, including two DuPont Columbia awards, a Peabody, and more than 100 local Emmys. The station also produced a series of one-minute documentaries during the mid-1980s, \"San Francisco Minutes\" and \"Bay Area Minutes\", which featured people, places and events in San Francisco and Bay Area history and usually featured narrations by KRON-TV personalities set to soaring music (e.g., Mark Thompson on San Francisco's cable cars, Lloyd Patterson on the San Mateo County coastline).\n\nIn the 1990s, the station utilized a \"24 Hour News\" format, with 30- to 60-second news updates each hour outside of regular newscasts. During the May 2001 sweeps period – its last as an NBC affiliate – KRON's newscasts beat KGO-TV's in the 5 and 6 p.m. timeslots by a very close margin, ending KGO's domination in those timeslots. When KRON lost NBC to KNTV and became an independent station in January 2002, the station expanded its news programming by adding two hours to its weekday morning newscast (from 7 to 9 a.m.), and extending its 6 p.m. newscast to one hour to fill timeslots vacated by the departures of \"Today\" and \"Nightly News\".\n\nUnlike most news-producing stations that have become independent after losing a network affiliation or that have switched to one of the post-1986 broadcast networks, KRON kept its late newscast in the 11 p.m. timeslot instead of moving it to or adding one at 10 p.m. (avoiding direct competition with KTVU's long-dominant primetime newscast, though KRON's late news remained in competition against KGO, KNTV and KPIX's late evening newscasts); the station also added a primetime newscast at 9 p.m. To this day, KRON maintains a newscast schedule similar to the one it had as an NBC affiliate. It is the only MyNetworkTV affiliate that has ever maintained a news schedule mirroring that of a Big Three affiliate (as it carries morning, 5, 6 and 11 p.m. newscasts). Several of KRON's veteran anchors and reporters left the station after the loss of the NBC affiliation; KRON also began incorporating video journalists (many of which were newer hires) to report, tape and edit news stories.\n\nDespite the overall decline of KRON as an independent, its newscasts initially pulled in respectable ratings though viewership was lower than it was before the station lost its NBC affiliation. During the February 2004 sweeps period, the station placed second in the ratings behind KTVU. However, KRON's news viewership has gradually fallen since that point; also in 2004, the station posted an 8.7% market share, down from the 21% share it had as an NBC affiliate. The 9 p.m. newscast created after becoming independent eventually fell to fourth place by 2005. In March 2006, KRON's morning newscast posted an average viewership of approximately 28,000 viewers. By 2009, overall viewership for the station's newscasts had fallen to fifth place among the Bay Area's news-producing English-language television stations.\n\nOn September 17, 2007, KRON-TV became the third station in the Bay Area (behind KGO and KTVU) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in widescreen—albeit in standard definition. In September 2008, KRON dropped its 5 p.m. newscast after the syndicated daytime talk show \"Dr. Phil\" was moved to the slot, the program's former 8 p.m. timeslot (which \"Dr. Phil\" held locally since the show's 2002 premiere) was replaced by an hour-long primetime newscast; this would be undone in September 2009, with the cancellation of the 8 p.m. newscast and \"Dr. Phil\"s return to the 8 p.m. slot, along with the reinstatement of a 5:30 p.m. newscast (which expanded back to 5 p.m. by 2010). The 8 p.m. newscast returned in September 2011, concurrent with the replacement of the 4 p.m. news with \"Dr. Phil\". KRON quietly upgraded its newscasts to high definition in April 2012, with the debut of new graphics. As of September 2013, only studio segments and on-air graphics are presented in HD, footage from field cameras and other news sources continue to be broadcast in widescreen SD.\n\nKRON launched a new 10 p.m newscast on May 16, 2016, that competes with newscasts on KTVU and KBCW. However, this meant that KRON's 11 p.m. news was shortened to 15 minutes until the latter newscast was dropped when it launched a new 9 p.m. newscast on August 21, 2017, which competes with KGO's 9 p.m. newscast for KOFY-TV.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1962192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962192", "title": "Poetic Justice (film)", "text": "Poetic Justice (film)\n\nPoetic Justice is a 1993 American romantic drama film written and directed by John Singleton and starring Janet Jackson and Tupac Shakur with Regina King and Joe Torry. In the film, the main character Justice writes poems which she recites throughout the film. The poems featured were written by Maya Angelou, and Angelou also appears in the film as one of the three elderly sisters whom the characters meet at a roadside family reunion. The Last Poets make an appearance toward the end of the film.\n\n\"Poetic Justice\" reached No. 1 in the box office its opening weekend, grossing $11,728,455. It eventually grossed a total of $27,515,786. Jackson received nominations for the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, with the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 number one song, \"Again\". It was later referenced in Kendrick Lamar's single \"Poetic Justice\", which was titled after and based on the film. The song sampled Jackson's \"Any Time, Any Place.\"\n\nDespite mixed reviews from critics, the film is considered a cult film especially for the performances and the chemistry between Jackson and Shakur.\n\nJustice (Janet Jackson) is a young woman living in South Central, Los Angeles. She was named Justice by her late mother, who gave birth to her while attending law school. After the shooting death of her boyfriend Markell (Q-Tip), Justice falls into a deep depression. She spends the majority of her time in the house that she inherited from her grandmother, with her cat White Boy, only going out to her job at a local hair salon. Justice is a talented poet, and she reads many of her poems throughout the course of the film, both to other characters and in voice over.\n\nJustice is at the hair salon working one day when a young postal clerk named Lucky (Tupac Shakur) comes in and begins flirting with her. She rebuffs his advances with the help of her female boss; the two women pretend to be lesbians and mock Lucky with their \"relationship\".\n\nLucky has also had tragedy in his life: his main focus is caring for his young daughter Keisha. He had to forcibly remove her from the care of her mother, Angel, a crack addict who was using drugs and having sex with her drug dealer while leaving the child unattended in the apartment. Lucky dreams of a professional career in music and shows considerable promise, but he insists that his cousin is the true talent.\n\nJustice's friend Iesha (Regina King) manages to talk Justice into taking a road trip to Oakland with Iesha's boyfriend, Chicago (Joe Torry), Lucky's co-worker at the post office. Justice warily accepts, mainly because she has to go to Oakland for a hair show and her car had stopped working at the last minute. Unbeknownst to Justice, Lucky is also on the trip, and she will now be sharing a postal van with him and their two mutual friends. Initially they argue, but they soften towards each other as they discover their similarities over the course of the film.\n\nThe foursome make a couple of detours, the first being a family reunion barbecue they see signs for on the road. Here it becomes apparent (although there were ample hints earlier) that Iesha and Chicago's relationship is troubled. Iesha openly flirts with other men at the barbecue, while Chicago broods watching her behavior. Iesha and Chicago argue in the mailtruck until Justice talks to Iesha about her behavior with alcohol. Iesha throws up and cries on Justice and apologizes to her.\n\nThe second stop is a carnival where Lucky and Justice grow closer as they discuss their lives. After leaving the reunion, they stop at a beach where each of the four characters contemplate their separate situations in internal monologues. After leaving the beach, the friction between Chicago and Iesha explodes when Iesha informs Chicago that she has been seeing someone on the side, and he physically attacks her. Lucky initially decides not to get involved in the fight until Justice defends Iesha by kicking Chicago in the groin, and Chicago turns his physical brutality at Justice in retaliation. Lucky, Justice, along with a bleeding and shaken Iesha leave Chicago by the side of the road and continue on their journey.\n\nLucky stops the postal van at a beach, and Justice goes to see what's wrong. She begins opening up to him about her life, and Lucky becomes sympathetic. They share a kiss, and Justice walks away apparently unsure of her feelings for Lucky. She goes back to him, and kiss again.\n\nWhen the now-threesome arrive in Oakland, they are met with the news that Lucky's cousin, with whom he had been working on recording music, has been killed. Lucky blames himself for not being in Oakland sooner, believing he could have prevented the shooting had he been in town. He turns his anger on Justice, angrily blaming her for distracting him while they were on the road. Jessie gives Justice and Iesha advice about men before the hair show. Lucky's uncle and aunt give Lucky his cousin's recording equipment. Lucky decides not to come back to work and to take care of Keisha.\n\nSome months have passed, and Lucky meets up with Justice again back at the hair salon, just at the moment he brings in his daughter Keisha. Lucky is remorseful over his conduct in Oakland and the cruel words he said to Justice there, and apologizes. She smiles at him and they share a passionate kiss. Justice smiles coyly, and then turns her attention to Keisha, fussing over her hair. Justice and Lucky's eyes meet over Keisha's head and they smile, their connection as strong as ever.\n\nOn July 23, 2013, John Singleton spoke with writer Lathleen Ade-Brown for \"Essence\" magazine and discussed the 20th anniversary of the film. The interview mentioned that in 1993, black female leads were rare and he wanted to give a voice to young African American women. He also revealed whose idea it was for Janet Jackson to wear the now iconic box braids: \"That was a collaboration between myself, Janet, [dance choreographer] Fatima Robinson and a dancer named Jossie Harris. Jossie had the braids in Michael Jackson’s “Remember the Time” video, which I directed. I brought her and Fatima and a couple of other dancers over to hang out with Janet and they all became friends. I said, \"Why don't we try and do Janet's hair like Jossie's hair?\" We got the hairstyle from Harlem and just put it in a West Coast movie.\". \n\nJada Pinkett Smith, Lisa Bonet, Monica Calhoun and many other popular actresses auditioned for the role of Justice, though Singleton knew from the script's draft that the role was solely intended for Janet Jackson. Rapper Ice Cube was offered the lead role of Lucky, but turned it down, stating that he was not in a point in his career that he would play in romantic movies. The movie was filmed in 1992.\n\nAccording to Box Office Mojo, \"Poetic Justice\" made $27,515,786 in the domestic box office with the budget being $14,000,000. For its opening weekend it opened at #1 with over $11,000,000 in ticket sales. It ranked #20 for the year of 1993 openings and #21 for highest R-rated movies of 1993.\n\nUpon its release, \"Poetic Justice\" received mixed to negative reviews with most critics comparing it unfavorably to the critically acclaimed film, also by Singleton, \"Boyz n the Hood.\" Much of the acclaim was directed to the performances by both Jackson and Shakur, with criticism stemming from the writing and story line. \n\nThe film currently holds a 34% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 32 reviews. The site's consensus states; \"\"Poetic Justice\" is commendably ambitious and boasts a pair of appealing stars, but they're undermined by writer-director John Singleton's frustrating lack of discipline.\"\n\nDespite the middling reviews from mainstream critics, the film is considered by many as one of Singleton's most enduring films.\n\nAcademy Awards\n\nGolden Globe Awards\n\nGolden Raspberry Awards\n\nMTV Movie Awards\n\nThe soundtrack album was released on June 29, 1993 through Epic Soundtrax, and consisted of a blend of hip hop and R&B music. It peaked at number 23 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart in the United States and was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on August 25, 1993. Three charting singles were released from the album: \"Indo Smoke\" by Mista Grimm, \"Get It Up\" by TLC, and \"Call Me a Mack\" by Usher Raymond.\n\nThe soundtrack also has the Stevie Wonder song \"Never Dreamed You'd Leave in Summer\", a track that was originally on his 1970 Motown Records album \"Where I'm Coming From\". The song \"Definition of a Thug Nigga\", recorded by Tupac Shakur for the film, later appeared on his 1997 posthumous album \"R U Still Down? (Remember Me)\".\n\nDue to the film's casting of two major music stars of the time, there was a lot of hype surrounding the release of the movie. Many were excited to see how the dynamic between Janet Jackson and Tupac Shakur would manifest itself in the film both visually and musically. On the soundtrack, each artist was given a single song. Tupac's \"Definition of a Thug Nigga\" could be seen as an example of braggadocios, violent rap music. But it could also be viewed as a cultural exposition on a lifestyle that Shakur felt to be systemic and inherent in the lives of his peers.\n\n"}

However, erosion led to its being torn down and its materials reused in the construction of this lighthouse. The light was originally lit by an oil lamp and broadcast by eight parabolic reflectors. This technology was already obsolete at the time of the lighthouse's construction, and it was replaced by a sixth-order Fresnel lens in 1856.\n\nIn the 1880s, the Stonington Breakwater Light was constructed farther out in the harbor, and the Stonington Harbor Light was decommissioned in 1889. The site is now the home of the Stonington Historical Society which uses the building as The Old Lighthouse Museum. Holdings in the museum document the area's long and distinguished cultural and nautical history, and exhibits include the 1856 Fresnel lens.\n\n\n\n"}

She rose to fame in 1987 after her debut single \"Tell It to My Heart\". Dayne achieved six additional U.S. top-10 singles, including \"Love Will Lead You Back\", \"Prove Your Love\", and \"I'll Always Love You\".\n\nDayne has sold over 75 million records worldwide, making her one of the world's best-selling music artists. She has earned three Grammy Award nominations, an American Music Award, and multiple New York Music Awards. She has also received New York Hall of Fame honors and was ranked number 18 on \"Rolling Stone\"'s list of the best female dance artists of all time. In December 2016, \"Billboard\" magazine ranked her the 28th most successful dance artist of all time.\n\nLeslie Wunderman began singing professionally after graduating from high school in Baldwin, Nassau County, New York, singing in little-known rock bands such as Felony and Next. She began singing solo after finishing college and, under the name Les Lee, recorded two dance singles, \"I'm The One You Want\" (1985) and \"Tell Me Can You Love Me\" (1986), which were released on New York indie label Mega Bolt.\n\nSigned to Arista Records as Taylor Dayne, her first song to crack the top ten was the dance-pop hit \"Tell It to My Heart\" in late 1987. The song was an instant smash worldwide, peaking in the top five of most major markets worldwide, and reaching number one in many countries, including West Germany. Six more U.S. top-ten hits followed, including \"Prove Your Love\", \"I'll Always Love You\", \"Don't Rush Me\", \"With Every Beat of My Heart\", \"Love Will Lead You Back\" and \"I'll Be Your Shelter\". These were followed by the No. 12 hit \"Heart of Stone\".\n\nIn the United States, she achieved three gold singles, \"Tell It to My Heart\", \"I'll Always Love You,\" and \"Love Will Lead You Back.\" \"I'll Always Love You,\" a change-of-pace ballad compared to Dayne's earlier releases, was her breakout hit on the Adult Contemporary charts in 1988 and paved the way for future uptempo dance tracks such as \"Don't Rush Me\" (1988) and \"With Every Beat Of My Heart\" (1989) to gain acceptance on Adult Contemporary radio. In 1990, \"Love Will Lead You Back\", a Diane Warren composition, peaked at No. 1 on both the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart.\n\nThe string of hits from her first two albums, \"Tell It to My Heart\" (1988) and \"Can't Fight Fate\" (1989), proved to be the peak of her career. She went on to release two more albums in the 1990s, but had only one more U.S. Top 40 hit, her 1993 cover of Barry White's 1974 hit \"Can't Get Enough of Your Love\" (from her 1993 album \"Soul Dancing\"), which reached No. 2 in the ARIA Charts in Australia but only No. 20 in the U.S.\n\nTogether with Arthur Baker and Fred Zarr, Dayne wrote \"Whatever You Want\" for Tina Turner's 1996 album \"Wildest Dreams.\" Dayne later recorded and released the song herself in 1998 as a single from her album \"Naked Without You.\" That album failed to chart, but Dayne continued to have hits on the dance charts into the 2000s.\n\nAs an actress, Dayne appeared in the 1997 sci-fi television series \"Nightman\" as Carla Day. She has had roles in independent films such as \"Fool's Paradise\" (1997), \"Stag\" (also in 1997) and \"Jesus the Driver\" (2004), as well as the Warren Beatty-produced 1994 remake of \"Love Affair.\" Dayne also had a recurring role on the Showtime series \"Rude Awakening.\"\n\nDayne has performed alongside Marc Bonilla and Dragonchoir. She performed on Broadway in Elton John's \"Aida\" in 2001. In 2005, Dayne was featured in the VH1 series \"Remaking\", which featured her close friends Leah Remini and Michelle Reid. The series documents Dayne's return to music after taking time off to have a family (she has twins via a surrogate mother), and premiered her newest song, \"Right Now,\" a result of her collaboration with Rodney Jerkins.\nOn December 11, 2007, Dayne released the first single, \"Beautiful\", from her studio album \"Satisfied\". The song was written by Dayne and Hitesh Ceon of production team 3Elementz. Dayne promoted it on many radio stations, including New York's WKTU. \"Beautiful\" went to No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Dance Charts. She also appeared on \"The Today Show\", \"Chelsea Lately\", \"Wake Up With Whoopi\" and VH1. The music video for the single and the \"Satisfied\" album cover were shot by Tony Duran, who has also shot album covers for Justin Timberlake and Jennifer Lopez.\n\nDayne released her fifth album, \"Satisfied\", in February 2008—her first recording studio album in nearly a decade. Producers on this record include Rick Nowels, Gregg Alexander and Peter Wade. The album includes both new material and recreations of some of her favorite contemporary songs.\n\nIn 2008, Dayne performed at the Paralympic Games in Beijing, China.\n\nIn May 2010, Dayne lobbied congressional leaders on Capitol Hill on behalf of NAMM (National Association of Music Merchants) and VH1's Save The Music Foundation to reduce cuts in music education in America's schools.\n\nIn July 2010, Dayne released \"Facing a Miracle\", the official theme song to the 2010 Gay Games. She performed the song to an audience of 50,000 on July 31, 2010, in Cologne, Germany. It ended the year at No. 9 on Perfect Beat's Top Worldwide Singles of 2010. Five years before, however, she had said: \"In the eyes of the Kaballah, [gays] can't be 'married.' That requires actual male and female energy and DNA. In the bigger picture, I think that 'marriage' is about a certain circuitry. I'm as married to my business manager as I would be any husband.\" \n\nDayne remastered her \"Greatest Hits\" album. She released a new single, \"Floor on Fire\", on 22 June 2011, which broke the \"Billboard\" Dance/Club Charts Top 10.\n\nIn 2011-2012 Dayne competed in , reaching the semifinal round in episode 5 facing off against Lou Diamond Phillips for the final spot to represent Team Rachael. At the end of the episode she lost to Joey Fatone of N'Sync in a runner-up challenge to win $5,000 for charity. \n\nIn the early 2010s, American stand-up comedian Tig Notaro began referencing Dayne in her routine, telling stories of having frequent encounters with her. This was ultimately brought to the attention of Ira Glass, who enlisted Notaro to tell the story as part of a live event for \"This American Life\". Dayne herself appeared at the end of the monologue during the event, singing \"I'll Always Love You.\"\n\nIn September 2014, Dayne released a new single, \"Dreaming\".\n\nDayne has never married. She has three children, two of whom were born via a surrogate. Dayne became a supporter of same-sex marriage (after having been opposed to it) in 2005, and stated in 2014 that she considers the LGBT community to be her most loyal fanbase.\n\nDayne is Jewish. She grew up in Baldwin and Freeport, New York.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1962208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962208", "title": "Lake Banook", "text": "Lake Banook\n\nLake Banook is a freshwater lake located in Dartmouth within the Halifax Regional Municipality in Nova Scotia, Canada. It is home to three sprint canoe and kayak clubs, two rowing clubs, and a dragon boat club. It also has a claim to be the birthplace of ice hockey.\n\nLake Banook's eastern shore is bordered by Prince Albert Road (part of Trunk 7) and its western shore fronts Crichton Park, a residential neighbourhood. At the south end of the lake is a lock mechanism leading to Sullivan's Pond. At the north end of the lake a bridge carries the Highway 111 expressway, informally known as the Dartmouth Circumferential Highway over its waters. The bridge also serves as a dividing line between Lake Micmac, also referred to as Second Lake.\n\nBirch Cove Beach is the only beach on the lake that is currently supervised. Another beach, Graham's Grove, was closed in the early-1990s, as a result of poor water quality stemming from the construction of the nearby \"Mic Mac Par-clo\" (partial clover-leaf), a large interchange connecting Highway 111, Trunk 7, and Route 318, which replaced the rotary previously on the site.\n\nLake Banook has undergone many modifications. It was originally approximately two meters shallower than its current depth, after being dammed during the construction of the Shubenacadie Canal in the early 19th century. When the water rose, it submerged a small island. During improvements for the 1989 Junior World Championships, the top section of the paddling course was dredged to meet depth standards. The fill was used to expand nearby Graham's Grove Park, and the former access road still remains underwater. There have been shoreline modifications for recreational beaches, private waterfront, boat docks, and municipal pipelines. Some natural shoreline remains at the north end of Brookdale Crescent Park, the north end of Birch Cove, and parts of Grahams Grove.\n\nLake Banook is named for the Mi'kmaq phrase for \"first lake\", as it is the first lake in the system that later became the Shubenacadie Canal. The Mi'kmaq people were the first to navigate the waters of Lake Banook, which contributed to the naming of Lake Micmac, Mic Mac Mall, and Mic Mac AAC.\n\nHockey was played on Lake Banook as early as 1827, and certainly by 1850, though the game was then known as both rickets and wicket. Dartmouth is one of several locales around the world that claim the title of \"Birthplace of Hockey.\" In 1864 Starr manufacturing of Dartmouth, located less than a kilometer from Lake Banook, began producing the world's first modern iceskates. Starr skates, first used on the lakes of Dartmouth including Lake Banook, later became a popular choice for elite ice hockey players, being worn by 6 out of 7 members of the 1902 Stanley Cup Champions Montreal Hockey Club. The Starr company produced ice skates into the 1930s. In the days before refrigerators, the lake was a source of ice for the residents of both Halifax and Dartmouth.\n\nSince 1903, with the formation of the Banook Canoe Club, Lake Banook has been home to many competitive and recreational canoeists, kayakers, and rowers. Dartmouth has more paddlers per capita than anywhere else in Canada.\n\nLake Banook is home to three sprint canoe/kayak clubs, clustered at the south end of the lake: Banook Canoe Club, Senobe Aquatic Club, and Mic Mac Amateur Aquatic Club. This arrangement is unique in Canada, and has led to a longstanding and healthy competitive rivalry between clubs. All three clubs have developed multiple Olympians, National Champions, and World Championship team members.\n\nThe lake is outfitted with an international-calibre 1000-metre sprint canoe and kayak race course during the summer months. The course spans nine racing lanes of nine metres in width, with the 1000-metre start line at the north end of the lake, and the finish line at the south end. On the western shore, a three-story judges tower is elevated above the lake at the finish line, allowing officials to judge the finishes of races. The course is used for numerous local and national competitions every year. Lake Banook has also hosted many world-class competitions, including the canoe/kayak and rowing events at the inaugural Canada Summer Games in 1969, the World Junior Canoe Sprint Championships in 1989, the Senior World Canoe Sprint Championship in 1997, the World Canoe Marathon Championship in 2001, and the Senior World Sprint Championships in 2009. Lake Banook will play host to the Senior World Sprint Championships for the third time in 2022. No other venue outside of Europe has hosted the Senior World Sprint Championship on more occasions.\n\nThe lake is also used for local rowing competitions, and hosts both the Mic Mac AAC rowing club and the independent North Star Rowing club. The course is not ideal for national or international competitions in rowing, as its restricted length does not enable 2000-metre races.\n\nAs dragon boat paddling exploded in popularity, a fifth boat club was founded in the northeast corner of Lake Banook. Dragon Boat East offers year-round training programs for members and other dragon boat services. Lake Banook is the site of Halifax's annual dragon boat competition and festival.\n\n"}

The Italian \"ragù\" (the word being borrowed from French) is a sauce used typically to dress pasta.\n\nThe basic method of preparation involves slow cooking over a low heat. The main ingredients are many; ragouts may be prepared with or without meat, a wide variety of vegetables may be incorporated, and they may be more or less heavily spiced and seasoned.\n\nTwo 18th-century English dishes from \"The Compleat Housewife\" show some of the varying meats, vegetables, seasonings, garnishes and procedures which can be applied to the ragoût.\n\n\"A Ragoo for made Dishes\" <br>\nTAKE claret, gravy, sweet-herbs, and savoury spice, toss up in it lamb-stones (i.e. lamb’s testicles), cock's-combs, boiled, blanched, and sliced, with sliced sweet-meats, oysters, mushrooms, truffles, and murrels; thicken these with brown butter; use it when called for.\n\n\"To make a Ragoo of Pigs-Ears\"<br>\nTAKE a quantity of pigs-ears, and boil them in one half wine and the other water; cut them in small pieces, then brown a little butter, and put them in, and a pretty deal of gravy, two anchovies, an eschalot or two, a little mustard, and some slices of lemon, some salt and nutmeg: stew all these together, and shake it up thick. Garnish the dish with barberries.\n\nIn his 19th century culinary dictionary, Alexander Dumas credits ragouts with making \"the ancient French cuisine shine\". He gives several examples including salpicons, made with a variety of meats and vegetables like mushrooms, artichokes, truffles, quenelles, and sweetbreads. According to Dumas each ingredient is cooked separately. The \"Ordinary Salpicon\" includes veal sweetbreads, ham, mushrooms, \"foir gras\" and truffles served in espagnole sauce. Celery ragout is cooked in bouillon seasoned with salt, nutmeg and pepper. Cucumber ragout is made with velouté sauce. One ragout is made with madeira, chestnuts and chipolata sausages cooked in bouillon with espagnole sauce.\n\nThe 1731 patriotic ballad \"The Roast Beef of Old England\" by the British writer Henry Fielding comically attributes Britain's traditional military prowess to the eating of roast beef, suggesting that this has been lost since the introduction of ragout from \"all-vapouring France\".\n\nIn the novel \"Pride and Prejudice\", the character Mr Hurst reacts with disdain when Elizabeth Bennet opts for a \"plain dish\" instead of a ragout at dinner.\n"}

The film stars Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy, with Omri Katz, Thora Birch, and Vinessa Shaw in supporting roles. The film follows a villainous comedic trio of witches who are inadvertently resurrected by a teenage boy in Salem, Massachusetts, on Halloween night.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on July 16, 1993, by Walt Disney Pictures. The film received mixed to negative reviews from film critics at the time of its release. It was not a critical or commercial success upon its release, possibly losing Disney around $16.5 million. However, largely through annual airings on Disney Channel and Freeform (formerly ABC Family), \"Hocus Pocus\" has been rediscovered by audiences, resulting in a yearly spike in home video sales of the movie every Halloween season that has helped make it a cult classic.\n\nA sequel, directed by Adam Shankman. is in development as a Disney+ exclusive film, with a screenplay written by Jen D'Angelo.\n\nOn October 31, 1693, near Salem, Massachusetts, Thackery Binx sees his little sister, Emily, spirited away to the cottage of three witches. There, the Sanderson sisters, Winifred, Sarah, and Mary, cast a spell on Emily to absorb her youth and regain their own, killing her in the process. Thackery confronts the witches who transform him into an immortal black cat cursed to live forever with his guilt for not saving Emily. The townsfolk, led by Binx's father, capture the witches. But before being hanged, Winifred's spellbook casts a curse that will resurrect the witches during a full moon on All Hallows' Eve when any virgin lights the Black Flame Candle. Unable to convince his father of his true identity as a cat, Thackery guards the cottage to ensure no one summons the witches.\n\nThree hundred years later, on October 31, 1993, on Halloween, Max Dennison is feeling unsettled from his family's sudden move from Los Angeles, California, to Salem, Massachusetts. Max takes his younger sister Dani trick-or-treating, where they run into Max's new crush Allison. Allison mentions that her family owns the Sanderson cottage as a museum. Max, in an effort to impress Allison, invites her to show him the Sanderson house to convince him that the witches were real.\n\nInvestigating inside the cottage, Max lights the Black Flame Candle and inadvertently resurrects the witches, who must continue to suck the souls of every child in Salem to continue living, or else they disintegrate. The witches attempt to suck the soul of Dani, but Max comes to her rescue. Escaping, Max steals Winifred's spellbook on advice from Thackery. The witches pursue them to a cemetery, where Winifred raises her unfaithful lover Billy Butcherson as a zombie to chase them on foot. The witches try to acclimate to the 20th century, but are horrified when they discover Halloween has become a holiday. They pursue the children across town using Mary's enhanced sense of smell. Max, Allison, and Dani find their parents at a Halloween party at the town hall, where Winifred enchants the partygoers to dance until they die. At Jacob Bailey High School, the children trap the witches in a kiln to burn them alive. While celebrating, the witches' curse revives them again. Not realizing that the witches haven't truly died, Max and Allison open the spellbook in an effort to reverse the spell on Binx. The open spellbook reveals the location of the group, and the witches track them down and kidnap Dani and Thackery, and get the book back. Sarah then uses her siren-like singing to mesmerize Salem's children, luring them to the Sandersons' cottage. Max and Allison rescue Dani and Thackery by tricking the witches into believing sunrise came an hour early.\n\nBack at the cemetery, Max runs into Billy, who cuts open his stitched up mouth and insults Winifred, joining Max to protect Dani. The witches attack and Winifred attempts to suck out the soul from Dani with the single vial of potion she retrieved from her cauldron. Thackery leaps on Winifred and knocks the potion out of her hand into Max's, but is then thrown to the ground and injured at the spot where his sister Emily's grave is. Rather than smashing the vial, Max drinks it in order to force the witches to take him instead of Dani. The sun rises just as Winifred is about to finish draining Max's life force, and due to standing on hallowed ground in the cemetery, she turns into a stone statue, before she is disintegrated into dust along with her sisters.\n\nWith the witches gone, Max, Dani, and Allison say goodbye to Billy Butcherson as he returns the grave and gets to sleep. Thackery Binx finally dies, freeing his soul. Appearing as a spectral, Thackery Binx thanks Max, Dani and Allison for their help, and bids farewell to them before reuniting with the spirit of his little sister Emily. A gate door opens and Thackery and Emily walk through it out to heaven, fading away as the gate door closes and Max, Dani, and Allison happily watch them depart. As the end credits begin, the exhausted partygoers, including Max and Dani's parents, Dave and Jenny, are freed from the now-broken spell and return home, oblivious to their enchantment. Meanwhile, at the Sandersons' cottage, Jay and Ice, two bullies who earlier tormented Max and Dani and were captured by the witches after inadvertently insulting them, remain imprisoned in their cages and sing \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\" to pass the time. The film ends with Winnie's spellbook opening its eye, revealing it is still alive and the witches could possibly return again.\n\n\nIn the 1994 TV documentary \"Hocus Pocus: Begin the Magic\", and on the film's Blu-ray release, producer David Kirschner said he came up with the idea for the film one night. He and his young daughter were sitting outside and his neighbor's black cat strayed by. Kirschner invented a tale of how the cat was once a boy who was changed into a feline three hundred years ago by three witches.\n\n\"Hocus Pocus\" started life as a script by Mick Garris, that was bought by Walt Disney Pictures in 1984. The film's working title was \"Disney's Halloween House\", it was much darker and scarier, and its protagonists were all 12-year-olds. Garris and Kirschner pitched it to Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment; Spielberg saw Disney as a competitor to Amblin in the family film market at the time and refused to co-produce a film with his \"rival.\"\n\nVarious rewrites were made to the script to make the film more comedic and made two of its young protagonists into teenagers; however, production was stalled several times until 1992, when Bette Midler expressed interest in the script and the project immediately went forward. Midler, who plays the central antagonist of the film (originally written for Cloris Leachman), is quoted as saying that \"Hocus Pocus\" \"was the most fun I'd had in my career up to that point\".\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio was originally offered the lead role of Max, but declined it in order to pursue \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\".\n\nPrincipal photography began on October 12, 1992. The film is set in Salem, Massachusetts, but most of it was shot on sound stages in Burbank, California. However, its daytime scenes were filmed in Salem and Marblehead, Massachusetts during two weeks of filming with principal cast. Production was completed on February 10, 1993.\n\nPioneer Village, a recreation of early-colonial Salem, was used for the opening scenes set in 1693. Other locations included Old Burial Hill in Marblehead, where Max is accosted by Ice and Jay, the Old Town Hall in Salem, where the town Halloween party takes place, and Phipps Elementary School, where the witches are trapped in a kiln. The exterior for Max and Dani's house is a private residence on Ocean Avenue in Salem.\n\nThe film was released to VHS in North America on September 9, 1994 and later to DVD on June 4, 2002. Following the film's release on the latter format, it has continued to show strong annual sales, raking in more than $1 million in DVD sales each October. In the mid-to-late 1990s, the film was rebroadcast annually on ABC and Disney Channel before switching over to ABC Family's \"13 Nights of Halloween\" lineup in the early 2000s. The film has continuously brought record viewing numbers to the lineup, including a 2009 broadcast watched by 2.5 million viewers. In 2011, an October 29 airing became the lineup's most watched program, with 2.8 million viewers. On September 4, 2012, the film was released on Blu-ray. Disney re-released the film on Blu-ray and Digital HD on September 2, 2018, as part of the film's 25th anniversary. The new release contains special features, including deleted scenes and a behind-the-scenes retrospective.\n\nThe musical score for \"Hocus Pocus\" was composed and conducted by John Debney. James Horner was originally slated to score the film, but became unavailable at the last minute, so Debney had to score the entire film in two weeks. Even though he didn't score the film, Horner came back to write the theme for Sarah (sung by Sarah Jessica Parker, more commonly known as \"Come Little Children\") which is featured in Intrada's Complete Edition of the score.\n\nDebney released a promotional score through the internet containing 19 tracks from the film. Bootlegs were subsequently released across the internet, primarily because the promotional release missed the entire opening sequence music.\n\n\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 34%, based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 4.4 stars out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Harmlessly hokey yet never much more than mediocre, \"Hocus Pocus\" is a muddled family-friendly effort that fails to live up to the talents of its impressive cast\".\n\nGene Siskel, reviewing for \"The Chicago Tribune\", remarked that the film was a \"dreadful witches' comedy with the only tolerable moment coming when Bette Midler presents a single song.\" Roger Ebert in \"The Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film one star out of a possible four, writing that it was \"a confusing cauldron in which there is great activity but little progress, and a lot of hysterical shrieking\". \"The Miami Herald\" called it \"a pretty lackluster affair\", adding this comment: \"Despite the triple-threat actress combo, \"Hocus Pocus\" won't be the \"Sister Act\" of 1993. There are a lot of gotta-sees this summer, and this isn't one of them.\"\n\nJanet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the film \"has flashes of visual stylishness but virtually no grip on its story\". Ty Burr of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a C-, calling it \"acceptable scary-silly kid fodder that adults will find only mildly insulting. Unless they're Bette Midler fans. In which case it's depressing as hell\"; and stating that while Najimy and Parker \"have their moments of ramshackle comic inspiration, and the passable special effects should keep younger campers transfixed [...] [T]he sight of the Divine Miss M. mugging her way through a cheesy supernatural kiddie comedy is, to say the least, dispiriting.\"\n\n\"Hocus Pocus\" was released July 16, 1993, and came in fourth place on its opening weekend, grossing $8.1 million. It dropped from the top ten ranking after two weeks of release. The film was released the same day as \"Free Willy\". According to Kirschner, Disney chose to release \"Hocus Pocus\" in July to take advantage of children being off from school for the summer.\n\nOver the years, through various outlets such as strong DVD sales and annual record-breaking showings on Freeform's \"13 Nights of Halloween\", the film has achieved cult status. Various media outlets such as Celebuzz and Oh No They Didn't have reiterated such claims. In its 25th anniversary year in 2018, the first week of \"Hocus Pocus\" viewings on Freeform averaged 8.2 million viewers. A special called the \"Hocus Pocus 25th Anniversary Halloween Bash\" was filmed at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery and features interviews with members of the cast, including Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy, as well as a costume contest hosted by Sharon and Kelly Osbourne. It aired on Freeform October 20, 2018.\n\nIn October 2011, the Houston Symphony celebrated various horror and Halloween classics, including \"Hocus Pocus\", with \"The Hocus Pocus Pops.\" On October 19, 2013, D23 held a special screening of \"Hocus Pocus\" at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California, to honor the 20th anniversary of the film. Nine of the cast and crew gathered for the screening, and hundreds of D23 members attended. Returning members included Kathy Najimy, David Kirschner, Thora Birch, Doug Jones, Vinessa Shaw, and Omri Katz.\n\nDuring her Divine Intervention Tour in 2015, Bette Midler appeared on stage dressed as Winifred Sanderson. Her Harlettes appeared with her dressed as Mary and Sarah, and the three of them performed the film's version of \"I Put a Spell on You\".\n\nOn September 15, 2015, the \"Hocus Pocus Villain Spelltacular\" was introduced at the Magic Kingdom as a part of Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party. The show introduces new actresses as the Sanderson Sisters, who try to make a villain party and summon or attract various Disney villains in the process. In September 2016, entertainment critic Aaron Wallace published \"Hocus Pocus in Focus: The Thinking Fan's Guide to Disney's Halloween Classic,\" the first full-length book written about the movie. The book includes a foreword by Thora Birch and afterword by Mick Garris. Billed as a \"lighthearted but scholarly look at the film,\" the book analyzes the movie's major themes, which it identifies as festivity, nostalgia, home, horror, virginity, feminism, Broadway-style musical moments, sibling rivalry, \"Spielbergian\" filmmaking style, Disney villain traditions, and more. Wallace also analyzes Walt Disney World's Hocus Pocus Villain Spelltacular as part of the movie's legacy and includes \"the largest collection of \"Hocus Pocus\" fun facts and trivia ever assembled,\" complete with extensive endnote citations.\n\nThe City of Salem has celebrated its connection to \"Hocus Pocus\", while local filming sites have become an attraction for fans as the movie's legacy has grown over the years. In 2018, the Haunted Happenings Grand Parade, an annual Salem festival held every October, was \"Hocus-Pocus\" themed in honor of the movie's 25th anniversary. A representative for Destination Salem also reported a huge uptick in tourism for the 25th anniversary year, stating: \"There’s always been a ‘Hocus Pocus’ component to the visitors to Salem, especially in October. But it's like the film's following grows every year.”\n\nIn July 2014, it was announced that Disney was developing a supernatural-themed film about witches, and that Tina Fey was on board as a producer and star. However, \"Deadline\" debunked rumors that the film was a sequel to \"Hocus Pocus\". In November 2014, Bette Midler said in an interview that she was ready and willing to return for a sequel. She also said her co-stars Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy were interested in reprising the roles of the Sanderson sisters as well, but stressed that Disney had yet to greenlight any sequel. In November 2015, Midler stated in a Facebook Q&A that \"after all these years and all the fan demand, I do believe I can stand and firmly say an unequivocal no\" in response to a question about a sequel.\n\nIn June 2016, actor Doug Jones mentioned that Disney had been considering a sequel, and behind the scenes discussions were in place to possibly continue the series. In October 2016, Sarah Jessica Parker was asked by Andy Cohen about a sequel. Her response was, \"I would love that. I think we've been very vocal that we're very keen.\" In \"Hocus Pocus in Focus: The Thinking Fan's Guide to Disney's Halloween Classic,\" author Aaron Wallace identifies several potential approaches for a sequel, but notes that the project's biggest challenge is the Walt Disney Studios' interest in tentpole projects that promise very high box office returns.\n\nIn September 2017, screenwriter Mick Garris admitted that he was working on a script for \"Hocus Pocus 2\" and that it would potentially be developed as a television film for Disney Channel, Freeform or ABC. It was later confirmed that it will instead be a remake to air on Freeform, with \"The Royals\" writer Scarlett Lacey attached to write, and the original film producer David Kirschner executive producing. The following month, Midler said she was not fond of the idea of a remake and she would not be taking part in it.\n\nIn July 2018, a book titled \"Hocus Pocus and the All-New Sequel\" was released, containing a novelization of the film and a sequel story. The sequel focuses on Max and Allison's daughter, Poppy, who grew up hearing the family story of the first film and parents who avoid Halloween as much as possible. Poppy is skeptical of the tale and ends up in the Sanderson house on Halloween, twenty-five years to the day after the movie, in an attempt to prove there's nothing to the story. \nIn October 2019, a sequel was announced to be in development as a Disney+ exclusive film, with a screenplay written by Jen D'Angelo. Shortly after the report, Midler, Parker, and Najimy all confirmed their interest in reprising their roles. In March 2020, Adam Shankman signed on to direct.\n\n\n"}

The teams compete at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I level as a member of the American Athletic Conference, except for the rifle team, which is a member of the single-sport Great America Rifle Conference.\n\nWhen the Memphis State University first fielded a football team in the fall of 1912, no one had selected a nickname for the squad. Early references to the football team tabbed them only as the Blue and Gray Warriors.\n\nAfter the final game of the 1914 season, there was a student parade. During this event, several university students shouted, \"We fight like Tigers!\" The nickname was born. As time passed, the nickname \"Tigers\" was increasingly used, particularly in campus publications, but did not catch on with the newspapers downtown. They continued to use \"the Blue and Gray\" when referring to the university.\n\nUnder Coach Lester Barnard in 1922, Memphis's football team gave a ring of truth to that old student yell about Tigers. The team adopted a motto – \"Every Man a Tiger\" – and went on to score 174 points while allowing its opponents just 29 points. The Tiger nickname continued on with students and alumni, eventually being adopted as the official nickname for the University of Memphis in 1939.\n\nThe official mascot is TOM III, a live bengal tiger. The university is one of a few schools in the country that keep a live tiger as a mascot, although the practice of live animals serving as university mascots is carried on by a number of other universities.\nThe Memphis Tigers men's basketball program first gained national prominence when it reached the 1973 NCAA Division I basketball championship game. The Tigers, led by Larry Finch, Larry Kenon, Ronnie Robinson, Bill Cook and others, eventually lost to John Wooden's UCLA Bruins, led by Bill Walton.\n\nThe Tigers continued an era of excellence throughout the 1980s and went to the Final Four in 1985 losing to Villanova, the ultimate winner of the tournament. The 1985 Final Four trip has since been vacated by the NCAA due to several recruiting violations committed by head coach Dana Kirk and his staff. Success continued through much of the 1990s. Under head coach John Calipari, the Tigers reached the Elite Eight three years in a row (2006–2008) and those same years won the conference championship, going undefeated in conference play in 2007 and 2008. Their record for those three seasons is 106–9. In 2007, the team was ranked #1 in ESPN's and CBSSports.com Pre-Season Polls and for the first time in 25 years, earned a #1 ranking on January 21, 2008 in both the AP Poll and the ESPN/USA Today Coaches' Poll. The 2008 season took the Tigers to the Final Four where Memphis lost the championship game to the Kansas Jayhawks in overtime, but later the Tigers' season and NCAA tournament appearance were vacated. In 2009, the Tigers entered the NCAA tournament as a No. 2 seed. However, they lost in the Sweet Sixteen to Missouri, 102–91. In April 2009, Josh Pastner was named head coach of the Tigers. He led the Tigers to four NCAA tournament appearances in his first five years, but never advanced past the round of 32 and missed the postseason entirely in his sixth and seventh seasons. In April 2016, a month after he had been named Sporting News Coach of the Year, Tubby Smith was hired as the new head coach of the Tigers.\n\nPerennial rivals include Louisville, American Athletic Conference foe Cincinnati, Ole Miss, UAB, the University of Southern Mississippi, and in-state rival University of Tennessee. The world record holder for the highest slam dunk (12 feet from floor to rim) is a former University of Memphis basketball forward, and current Harlem Globetrotter Michael Wilson. At home, the Tigers play on Beale Street in the state-of-the-art FedExForum.\n\nThe Memphis Tigers women's basketball team competes in the American Athletic Conference. They previously competed in Conference USA in which they have won two Conference USA conference tournament championships and, prior to that two Metro Conference tournament championships. They play home games at the Elma Roane Fieldhouse and FedExForum.\n\nEver since 1982, the Memphis Men's soccer program has put together a competitive team. The program began in the Great Midwest Conference and then moved to Conference USA in 1995. In 2013, the Tiger's soccer team, and all of the tiger athletics, moved to the new American Athletic Conference. In this new conference, the soccer program and the entirety of the U of M athletics will be challenged by some of the best teams around the country. The Conference USA championship the Tiger's claimed in 2004 is a nice exclamation point for the program's different successes over the years.\n\nIn 1999, Richie Grant took over the University of Memphis Soccer Program and has now been at the helm for 14 years. He is the most successful Memphis Soccer coach the university has had since the program started. Grant got his start in collegiate coaching in 1995, taking over the NAIA program at Lambuth University. During his four seasons at Lambuth, Grant won over 50 games and three conference championships.\n\nCoach Grant began his career at Memphis with a below average 7–11–1 record. However, the next season Coach Grant and his team won a then-program record 14 games and finished fourth in the C-USA regular season standings. That 14 win season resulted in Coach Grant receiving his first C-USA Coach of the Year honor in 2000. In 2004 Coach Grant received his second C-USA Coach of the Year award when Memphis won a school-record 16 games, made its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 1993 and had the program's first All-American selection in Daton O'Brien.\n\nAs a player, Grant was a three-time NAIA All-America defender and was twice named the NAIA District V Player of the Year at Green Mountain College in Poultney, Vt. Grant received his bachelor's degree in leisure resources and facilities management at Green Mountain College and in 1993 and went on to play one season for the a semi-pro team called the Minnesota Thunder.\nCoach Grant is married to Lady Tigers soccer assistant coach Jodi Grant and has one daughter and one son.\n\nThe Tigers practice and play at the Mike Rose Soccer Complex, which has multiple fields in addition to the 2,500 seat stadium.\n\nOver the course of Memphis Soccer, the program has developed some great players. Five of those players went on to play at the professional level. The players are as follows:\n\nThe University of Memphis football program dates back to 1912.\n\nAfter decades of independence, the Memphis football program competed in Conference USA until 2013. Then the football team joined the American Athletic Conference. As of December 8, 2011, the team's head coach became Justin Fuente who replaced Larry Porter. The Tigers' home field is 62,380 seat Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium. The U of M played in five bowl games in six seasons from 2003 to 2008. In 2005, the Tigers football team was led in the Motor City Bowl by DeAngelo Williams, a then-senior All-American running back and eventual first-round draft pick by the Carolina Panthers of the NFL.\n\nThe men's golf team has won six conference championship:\n\nHillman Robbins won the NCAA Championship in 1954.\n\nThe Memphis Tigers Pom Squad is recognized as one of the best collegiate dance squads in the country, having won national championships in 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 2000, 2007, 2008, 2011, and 2012.\n\nRecent professional athletes from the University of Memphis include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

In her collegiate career, Price was named to the All-SEC First Team three times and became the first player to be named SEC Defensive Player of the Year twice. With Cheryl Miller she is one of only two players in NCAA history to record 2000 points, 1000 rebounds, 400 assists and 400 steals.

Of the 4,100-plus votes cast, 81% supported a change. On October 6, 2017, university chancellor Jeffrey S. Vitter announced that the university was switching its official mascot to the Landshark. \nThe term “Landshark” originated in 2008 from a senior linebacker Tony Fein and was adopted by the Ole Miss football team's defensive unit. Fein was an Army veteran who served in the Iraq War before enrolling at the University of Mississippi. Fein also received the Pat Tillman Award by the Military Order of the Purple Heart in 2008.\n\nOle Miss' major athletic rivals are with the Mississippi State Bulldogs (MSU), the LSU Tigers (see Magnolia Bowl), and the Arkansas Razorbacks.

Since 1978, Ole Miss is 52–90 against MSU.\n\nLSU has a 58–40–4 advantage in the all-time football series with Ole Miss.\n\nThe Hotty Toddy cheer is a chant unique to Ole Miss. The cheer is primarily used at Ole Miss sporting events, and is commonly started by cheerleaders, fans, and players... The Ole Miss Band plays the cheer with a drum cadence following the school`s fight song, \"Forward Rebels\". The band also plays a version of the cheer put to the tune of Rock N Roll Part 2 by Gary Glitter, known as “Hey, Go Rebs!”. The two word phrase “Hotty Toddy,” is commonly used as a greeting between students, alumni, and fans associated with Ole Miss, similar to the University of Alabama`s Roll Tide and Auburn University`s War Eagle\n\nLyrics\n\n\"“Are you Ready?\n\nHell Yes! Damn Right!\n\nHotty Toddy, Gosh Almighty,\n\nWho in the hell are we? Hey!\n\nFlim Flam, Bim Bam,\n\nOle Miss By Damn!”\n\nHistory\n\nThe cheer first appeared in print on November 19, 1926 in the student newspaper \"The Mississippian\", now known as \"The Daily Mississippian\". The Hotty Toddy was printed along with all of the popular sports cheers used by the students at the time. However, the lyrics were slightly different than the version used today. The original cheer was printed:\n\n\"“Heighty! Tighty! Gosh A Mighty\n\nWho in the hell are we?\n\nRim! Ram! Flim! Flam!\n\nOle Miss By Damn.”\n\nPossible Origins\n\nWhile there are many theories as to where the Hotty Toddy cheer started, the exact origins remain a mystery. Perhaps the leading theory suggests that the cheer was created by the school`s cheerleaders or band. The cheer was printed several days before Ole Miss was set to face off against instate rival Mississippi State, who were said to refer to Ole Miss fans as \"Hoity-Toitys.\" Ole Miss had lost thirteen straight games going into the 1926 matchup in Starkville. Prior to the game, Ole Miss held pep rallies on campus and even organized a train to take the students and the newly formed Band to the game. After Ole Miss won the game, the Rebel fans stormed the field and attempted to tear down their goalposts. A brawl ensued between the two schools, and the following season, the Egg Bowl Trophy was introduced to maintain the peace. The iconic game that led to the creation of the Egg Bowl could also have solidified the Hotty Toddy cheer at Ole Miss.\n\nThe cheer also appeared in the school`s original fight song. According to \"The Ole Miss Experience\", music professor Arleen Tye wrote a fight song for the school in 1931 entitled “Ole Miss.” The song`s chorus included “Hi-ty, Ti-ty, Gosh a’mighty, Who the heck are we?”. While the original fight song was discontinued, the school`s current fight song, \"Forward Rebels\", includes the Hotty Toddy cheer as well. Some historians believe the Ole Miss Band may have borrowed the cheer from the Virginia Tech Regimental Band, which was nicknamed the, “Highty-Tighties” in 1919\n\nSome other theories suggest that the cheer was fashioned by Ole Miss legendary cheerleader and sports fan, Blind Jim Ivy. Also, it is believed that the alcoholic beverage, Hot Toddy, could be the basis for the cheer.\n\nHotty Toddy In Pop Culture\n\nPrior to every home football game, Ole Miss plays a video of a celebrity starting the Hotty Toddy cheer. Some of the celebrities that have participated include Russell Crowe, Snoop Dogg, Betty White, Katy Perry, Morgan Freeman, The Robertson Family from Duck Dynasty, Sandra Bullock, Jack Black, and more A variation of the cheer also appeared in the series, Band of Brothers, written as\"Highty Tighty, Christ Almighty, Who the hell are we? zim ram, Goddamn, we`re Airborne Infantry.\"\n\nThe school's fight song is \"Forward Rebels.\" It is played by the Ole Miss \"The Pride of the South\" marching band at official university sporting events.\n\nThe song \"Dixie\" was played by the Ole Miss band for years at athletic events until the University of Mississippi Athletic Department requested to remove the song from the Ole Miss Football and Ole Miss band playlist in 2016.\n\nA modification of the Elvis Presley song \"An American Trilogy\", now known as \"From Dixie with Love\" or \"Slow Dixie\", was also played during football games, both home and away. The song was first played during the halftime performance at the Ole Miss/LSU game of 1980 in Tiger Stadium. Upon its completion, the band received a standing ovation from more than 70,000 people on hand that day. It soon became a staple of the band for many years. During Ole Miss's winning streak of 2003, audiences began chanting \"The South will rise again\" in place of \"His truth is marching on\" at the end of the song. The chant remained a staple for the next several years. In 2009, with Ole Miss in the national spotlight for football success, political pressure mounted to do away with the chant. The Student Body Government proposed to call for the chant to be changed to \"To Hell with LSU\". When this proposal was not enacted, the university asked the band to quit playing the song.\n\nThe band also plays a modification of \"Dixie\" called \"Dixie Fanfare.\"\n\nThe Hockey team has a special cheer of \"HUHHH\" along with power glide and Donald Trump, by Mac Miller, as the win songs.\n"}

Yin-yang and the Five Elements, as well as the divisions of learning to which they were linked – astronomy, calendar-making, the reckoning of time, divination, and studies based on observation of nature – were amalgamated into fortune telling. This process of judging auspicious or harmful signs present in the natural world, was accepted into Japanese society as a technique for predicting good or bad fortune in the human world. Such techniques were known mostly by Buddhist monks from mainland Asia, who were knowledgeable in reading and writing Chinese. Over time, demand from members of the imperial court who believed that \"onmyōdō\" divination would be helpful in decision-making, made it necessary for the laity to perform the art, and \"onmyōji\" began to appear around the middle of the 7th century.\n\nDuring the Heian period the nobility organized their lives around practices recommended by \"onmyōji\". The practice of \"lucky and unlucky directions\" provides an example. Depending on the season, time of day, and other circumstances, a particular direction might be bad luck for an individual. If one's house was located in that direction, such an individual was advised not to go back directly to his house but had to \"change direction\" (\"katatagae\"), by going in a different direction and lodging there. Such a person would not dare to go in the forbidden direction, but stayed where they were, even if that resulted in absence from the court, or passing up invitations from influential people.\n\nIn the 10th century and his son Kamo no Yasunori, made great advancements in \"onmyōdō\", astronomy and calendar science. From among their students emerged Abe no Seimei, who displayed superior skills in the divining arts of \"onmyōdō\", by which he gained an uncommon amount of trust from the court society. Tadayuki and Yasunori passed on their skills in astronomy to Seimei while their advances in calendar-making went to Yasunori's son. From the end of the Heian period into the Middle Ages, astronomy and calendar science were completely subsumed into \"onmyōdō\", and the Abe and Kamo families came to dominate the art.\n\n was one of the classifications of civil servants belonging to the Bureau of \"Onmyō\" in ancient Japan's \"ritsuryo\" system. People with this title were professional practitioners of \"onmyōdō\".\n\n\"Onmyōji\" were specialists in magic and divination. Their court responsibilities ranged from tasks such as keeping track of the calendar, to mystical duties such as divination and protection of the capital from evil spirits. They could divine auspicious or harmful influences in the earth, and were instrumental in the moving of capitals. It is said that an \"onmyōji\" could also summon and control \"shikigami\".\n\nFamous \"onmyōji\" include Kamo no Yasunori and Abe no Seimei (921–1005). After Seimei's death, the emperor had a shrine erected at his home in Kyoto.\n\n\"Onmyōji\" had political clout during the Heian period, but in later times when the imperial court fell into decline, their state patronage was lost completely. In modern-day Japan \"onmyōji\" are defined as a type of priest, and although there are many who claim to be mediums and spiritualists, the \"onmyōji\" continues to be a hallmark occult figure.\n\n\n\n"}

One of the first depictions of an Amish community in American pop culture, it includes a traditional barn raising and an old-fashioned country wedding. The musical ran on Broadway in 1955–56, and has been produced yearly at the Round Barn Theatre in Nappanee, Indiana since 1986.\n\nThe show opened pre-Broadway at the Shubert Theater in Philadelphia on January 5, 1955. The Broadway production, directed by Morton DaCosta and choreographed by Helen Tamiris, opened on January 27, 1955, at the Mark Hellinger Theater. It was produced by Richard Kollmar. It transferred to the Winter Garden Theatre on February 28, 1955, where it remained until November 7, 1955 before returning to the Mark Hellinger on November 9, 1955, closing on March 3, 1956 after a total of 461 performances. The cast included Richard Derr as Dan, Shirl Conway as Ruth, Will Able as Jacob, Gloria Marlowe as Katie, Douglas Fletcher Rodgers as Ezra, Barbara Cook as Hilda, David Daniels as Peter, and the then-12 year old Scott Walker (billed as \"Scotty Engel\") as a young miller. Bea Arthur understudied Conway and Carol Lawrence was among the chorus members. Lawrence recorded her version of the song \"This is All Very New to Me\" from the album \"Tonight at 8:30\" (1960)\n\nA U.

While there, they become involved with the local villagers, including Hilda Miller, who mistakes Dan's kindness for romantic overtures, and Ezra's banished brother Peter, who returns to claim the hand of his childhood sweetheart - Katie.\n\n\nOriginal cast recordings of both the Broadway and London productions were released.\n\n"}
{"id": "1962246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962246", "title": "Geobiology", "text": "Geobiology\n\nGeobiology is a field of scientific research that explores the interactions between the physical Earth and the biosphere. It is a relatively young field, and its borders are fluid. There is considerable overlap with the fields of ecology, evolutionary biology, microbiology, paleontology, and particularly soil science and biogeochemistry. Geobiology applies the principles and methods of biology, geology, and soil science to the study of the ancient history of the co-evolution of life and Earth as well as the role of life in the modern world. Geobiologic studies tend to be focused on microorganisms, and on the role that life plays in altering the chemical and physical environment of the pedosphere, which exists at the intersection of the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere and/or cryosphere. It differs from biogeochemistry in that the focus is on processes and organisms over space and time rather than on global chemical cycles.\n\nGeobiological research synthesizes the geologic record with modern biologic studies. It deals with process - how organisms affect the Earth and vice versa - as well as history - how the Earth and life have changed together. Much research is grounded in the search for fundamental understanding, but geobiology can also be applied, as in the case of microbes that clean up oil spills.\n\nGeobiology employs molecular biology, environmental microbiology, chemical analyses, and the geologic record to investigate the evolutionary interconnectedness of life and Earth. It attempts to understand how the Earth has changed since the origin of life and what it might have been like along the way. Some definitions of geobiology even push the boundaries of this time frame - to understanding the origin of life and to the role that man has played and will continue to play in shaping the Earth in the Anthropocene.\n\nThe term geobiology was coined by Lourens Baas Becking in 1934. In his words, geobiology \"is an attempt to describe the relationship between organisms and the Earth,\" for \"the organism is part of the Earth and its lot is interwoven with that of the Earth.\" Baas Becking's definition of geobiology was born of a desire to unify environmental biology with laboratory biology. The way he practiced it aligns closely with modern environmental microbial ecology, though his definition remains applicable to all of geobiology. In his book, Geobiology, Bass Becking stated that he had no intention of inventing a new field of study.Baas Becking's understanding of geobiology was heavily influenced by his predecessors, including Martinus Beyerinck, his teacher from the Dutch School of Microbiology. Others included Vladimir Vernadsky, who argued that life changes the surface environment of Earth in The Biosphere, his 1926 book, and Sergei Vinogradsky, famous for discovering lithotrophic bacteria.\n\nThe first laboratory officially dedicated to the study of geobiology was the Baas Becking Geobiological Laboratory in Australia, which opened its doors in 1965. However, it took another 40 or so years for geobiology to become a firmly rooted scientific discipline, thanks in part to advances in geochemistry and genetics that enabled scientists to begin to synthesize the study of life and planet.\n\nIn the 1930s, Alfred Treibs discovered chlorophyll-like porphyrins in petroleum, confirming its biological origin, thereby founding organic geochemistry and establishing the notion of biomarkers, a critical aspect of geobiology. But several decades passed before the tools were available to begin to search in earnest for chemical marks of life in the rocks. In the 1970s and '80s, scientists like Geoffrey Eglington and Roger Summons began to find lipid biomarkers in the rock record using equipment like GCMS.\n\nOn the biology side of things, in 1977, Carl Woese and George Fox published a phylogeny of life on Earth, including a new domain - the Archaea. And in the 1990s, genetics and genomics studies became possible, broadening the scope of investigation of the interaction of life and planet.\n\nToday, geobiology has its own journals, such as \"Geobiology\", established in 2003, and \"Biogeosciences\", established in 2004, as well as recognition at major scientific conferences. It got its own Gordon Research Conference in 2011, a number of geobiology textbooks have been published, and many universities around the world offer degree programs in geobiology (see External links).\n\nPerhaps the most profound geobiological event is the introduction of oxygen into the atmosphere by photosynthetic bacteria. This oxygenation of Earth's primoidial atmosphere (the so-called oxygen catastrophe or Great Oxygenation Event) and the oxygenation of the oceans altered surface biogeochemical cycles and the types of organisms that have been evolutionarily selected for.\n\nA subsequent major change was the advent of multicellularity. The presence of oxygen allowed eukaryotes and, later, multicellular life to evolve.\n\nMore anthropocentric geobiologic events include the origin of animals and the establishment of terrestrial plant life, which affected continental erosion and nutrient cycling, and likely changed the types of rivers observed, allowing channelization of what were previously predominantly braided rivers.\n\nMore subtle geobiological events include the role of termites in overturning sediments, coral reefs in depositing calcium carbonate and breaking waves, sponges in absorbing dissolved marine silica, the role of dinosaurs in breaching river levees and promoting flooding, and the role of large mammal dung in distributing nutrients.\n\nGeobiology is founded upon a few core concepts that unite the study of Earth and life. While there are many aspects of studying past and present interactions between life and Earth that are unclear, several important ideas and concepts provide a basis of knowledge in geobiology that serve as a platform for posing researchable questions, including the evolution of life and planet and the co-evolution of the two, genetics - from both a historical and functional standpoint, the metabolic diversity of all life, the sedimentological preservation of past life, and the origin of life.\n\nA core concept in geobiology is that life changes over time through evolution. The theory of evolution postulates that unique populations of organisms or species arose from genetic modifications in the ancestral population which were passed down by drift and natural selection.\n\nAlong with standard biological evolution, life and planet co-evolve. Since the best adaptations are those that suit the ecological niche that the organism lives in, the physical and chemical characteristics of the environment drive the evolution of life by natural selection, but the opposite can also be true: with every advent of evolution, the environment changes.\n\nA classic example of co-evolution is the evolution of oxygen-producing photosynthetic cyanobacteria which oxygenated Earth's Archean atmosphere. The ancestors of cyanobacteria began using water as an electron source to harness the energy of the sun and expelling oxygen before or during the early Paleoproterozoic. During this time, around 2.4 to 2.1 billion years ago, geologic data suggests that atmospheric oxygen began to rise in what is termed the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE). It is unclear for how long cyanobacteria had been doing oxygenic photosynthesis before the GOE. Some evidence suggests there were geochemical \"buffers\" or sinks suppressing the rise of oxygen such as volcanism though cyanobacteria may have been around producing it before the GOE. Other evidence indicates that the rise of oxygenic photosynthesis was coincident with the GOE.\n\nThe presence of oxygen on Earth from its first production by cyanobacteria to the GOE and through today has drastically impacted the course of evolution of life and planet. It may have triggered the formation of oxidized minerals and the disappearance of oxidizable minerals like pyrite from ancient stream beds. The presence of banded-iron formations (BIFs) have been interpreted as a clue for the rise of oxygen since small amounts of oxygen could have reacted with reduced ferrous iron (Fe(II)) in the oceans, resulting in the deposition of sediments containing Fe(III) oxide in places like Western Australia. However, any oxidizing environment, including that provided by microbes such as the iron-oxidizing photoautotroph \"Rhodopseudomonas palustris\", can trigger iron oxide formation and thus BIF deposition. Other mechanisms include oxidation by UV light. Indeed, BIFs occur across large swaths of Earth's history and may not correlate with only one event.\n\nOther changes correlated with the rise of oxygen include the appearance of rust-red ancient paleosols, different isotope fractionation of elements such as sulfur, and global glaciations and Snowball Earth events, perhaps caused by the oxidation of methane by oxygen, not to mention an overhaul of the types of organisms and metabolisms on Earth. Whereas organisms prior to the rise of oxygen were likely poisoned by oxygen gas as many anaerobes are today, those that evolved ways to harness the electron-accepting and energy-giving power of oxygen were poised to thrive and colonize the aerobic environment.\nEarth has not remained the same since its planetary formation 4.5 billion years ago. Continents have formed, broken up, and collided, offering new opportunities for and barriers to the dispersal of life. The redox state of the atmosphere and the oceans has changed, as indicated by isotope data. Fluctuating quantities of inorganic compounds such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, methane, and oxygen have been driven by life evolving new biological metabolisms to make these chemicals and have driven the evolution of new metabolisms to use those chemicals. Earth acquired a magnetic field about 3.4 Ga that has undergone a series of geomagnetic reversals on the order of millions of years. The surface temperature is in constant fluctuation, falling in glaciations and Snowball Earth events due to ice-albedo feedback, rising and melting due to volcanic outgassing, and stabilizing due to silicate weathering feedback.\n\nAnd the Earth is not the only one that changed - the luminosity of the sun has increased over time. Because rocks record a history of relatively constant temperatures since Earth's beginnings, there must have been more greenhouse gasses to keep the temperatures up in the Archean when the sun was younger and fainter. All these major differences in the environment of the Earth placed very different constraints on the evolution of life throughout our planet's history. Moreover, more subtle changes in the habitat of life are always occurring, shaping the organisms and traces that we observe today and in the rock record.\n\nThe genetic code is key to observing the history of evolution and understanding the capabilities of organisms. Genes are the basic unit of inheritance and function and, as such, they are the basic unit of evolution and the means behind metabolism.\n\nPhylogeny takes genetic sequences from living organisms and compares them to each other to reveal evolutionary relationships, much like a family tree reveals how individuals are connected to their distant cousins. It allows us to decipher modern relationships and infer how evolution happened in the past.\n\nPhylogeny can give some sense of history when combined with a little bit more information. Each difference in the DNA indicates divergence between one species and another. This divergence, whether via drift or natural selection, is representative of some lapse of time. Comparing DNA sequences alone gives a record of the history of evolution with an arbitrary measure of phylogenetic distance “dating” that last common ancestor. However, if information about the rate of genetic mutation is available or geologic markers are present to calibrate evolutionary divergence (i.e. fossils), we have a timeline of evolution. From there, with an idea about other contemporaneous changes in life and environment, we can begin to speculate why certain evolutionary paths might have been selected for.\n\nMolecular biology allows scientists to understand a gene's function using microbial culturing and mutagenesis. Searching for similar genes in other organisms and in metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data allows us to understand what processes could be relevant and important in a given ecosystem, providing insight into the biogeochemical cycles in that environment.\n\nFor example, an intriguing problem in geobiology is the role of organisms in the global cycling of methane. Genetics has revealed that the methane monooxygenase gene (\"pmo\") is used for oxidizing methane and is present in all aerobic methane-oxidizers, or methanotrophs. The presence of DNA sequences of the \"pmo\" gene in the environment can be used as a proxy for methanotrophy. A more generalizable tool is the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, which is found in bacteria and archaea. This gene evolves very slowly over time and is not usually horizontally transferred, and so it is often used to distinguish different taxonomic units of organisms in the environment. In this way, genes are clues to organismal metabolism and identity. Genetics enables us to ask 'who is there?' and 'what are they doing?' This approach is called metagenomics.\n\nLife harnesses chemical reactions to generate energy, perform biosynthesis, and eliminate waste. Different organisms use very different metabolic approaches to meet these basic needs. While animals such as ourselves are limited to aerobic respiration, other organisms can \"breathe\" sulfate (SO42-), nitrate (NO3-), ferric iron (Fe(III)), and uranium (U(VI)), or live off energy from fermentation. Some organisms, like plants, are autotrophs, meaning that they can fix carbon dioxide for biosynthesis. Plants are photoautotrophs, in that they use the energy of light to fix carbon. Microorganisms employ oxygenic and anoxygenic photoautotrophy, as well as chemoautotrophy. Microbial communities can coordinate in syntrophic metabolisms to shift reaction kinetics in their favor. Many organisms can perform multiple metabolisms to achieve the same end goal; these are called mixotrophs.\n\nBiotic metabolism is directly tied to the global cycling of elements and compounds on Earth. The geochemical environment fuels life, which then produces different molecules that go into the external environment. (This is directly relevant to biogeochemistry.) In addition, biochemical reactions are catalyzed by enzymes which sometimes prefer one isotope over others. For example, oxygenic photosynthesis is catalyzed by RuBisCO, which prefers carbon-12 over carbon-13, resulting in carbon isotope fractionation in the rock record.\nSedimentary rocks preserve remnants of the history of life on Earth in the form of fossils, biomarkers, isotopes, and other traces. The rock record is far from perfect, and the preservation of biosignatures is a rare occurrence. Understanding what factors determine the extent of preservation and the meaning behind what is preserved are important components to detangling the ancient history of the co-evolution of life and Earth. The sedimentary record allows scientists to observe changes in life and Earth in composition over time and sometimes even date major transitions, like extinction events.\n\nSome classic examples of geobiology in the sedimentary record include stromatolites and banded-iron formations. The role of life in the origin of both of these is a heavily debated topic.\n\nThe first life arose from abiotic chemical reactions. When this happened, how it happened, and even what planet it happened on are uncertain. However, life follows the rules of and arose from lifeless chemistry and physics. It is constrained by principles such as thermodynamics. This is an important concept in the field because it is represents the epitome of the interconnectedness, if not sameness, of life and Earth.\n\nWhile often delegated to the field of astrobiology, attempts to understand how and when life arose are relevant to geobiology as well. The first major strides towards understanding the “how” came with the Miller-Urey experiment, when amino acids formed out of a simulated “primordial soup”. Another theory is that life originated in a system much like the hydrothermal vents at mid-oceanic spreading centers. In the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, a variety of hydrocarbons form under vent-like conditions. Other ideas include the “RNA World” hypothesis, which postulates that the first biologic molecule was RNA and the idea that life originated elsewhere in the solar system and was brought to Earth, perhaps via a meteorite.\n\nWhile geobiology is a diverse and varied field, encompassing ideas and techniques from a wide range of disciplines, there are a number of important methods that are key to the study of the interaction of life and Earth that are highlighted here.\n\nAs its name suggests, geobiology is closely related to many other fields of study, and does not have clearly defined boundaries or perfect agreement on what exactly they comprise. Some practitioners take a very broad view of its boundaries, encompassing many older, more established fields such as biogeochemistry, paleontology, and microbial ecology. Others take a more narrow view, assigning it to emerging research that falls between these existing fields, such as with geomicrobiology. The following list includes both those that are clearly a part of geobiology, e.g. geomicrobiology, as well as those that share scientific interests but have not historically been considered a sub-discipline of geobiology, e.g. paleontology.\n\nAstrobiology is an interdisciplinary field that uses a combination of geobiological and planetary science data to establish a context for the search for life on other planets. The origin of life from non-living chemistry and geology, or abiogenesis, is a major topic in astrobiology. Even though it is fundamentally an earth-bound concern, and therefore of great geobiological interest, getting at the origin of life necessitates considering what life requires, what, if anything, is special about Earth, what might have changed to allow life to blossom, what constitutes evidence for life, and even what constitutes life itself. These are the same questions that scientists might ask when searching for alien life. In addition, astrobiologists research the possibility of life based on other metabolisms and elements, the survivability of Earth's organisms on other planets or spacecrafts, planetary and solar system evolution, and space geochemistry.\n\nBiogeochemistry is a systems science that synthesizes the study of biological, geological, and chemical processes to understand the reactions and composition of the natural environment. It is concerned primarily with global elemental cycles, such as that of nitrogen and carbon. The father of biogeochemistry was James Lovelock, whose “Gaia hypothesis” proposed that Earth's biological, chemical, and geologic systems interact to stabilize the conditions on Earth that support life.\n\nGeobiochemistry is similar to biogeochemistry, but differs by placing emphasis on the effects of geology on the development of life's biochemical processes, as distinct from the role of life on Earth's cycles. Its primary goal is to link biological changes, encompassing evolutionary modifications of genes and changes in the expression of genes and proteins, to changes in the temperature, pressure, and composition of geochemical processes to understand when and how metabolism evolved. Geobiochemistry is founded on the notion that life is a planetary response because metabolic catalysis enables the release of energy trapped by a cooling planet.\n\nMicrobiology is a broad scientific discipline pertaining to the study of that life which is best viewed under a microscope. It encompasses several fields that are of direct relevance to geobiology, and the tools of microbiology all pertain to geobiology. Environmental microbiology is especially entangled in geobiology since it seeks an understanding of the actual organisms and processes that are relevant in nature, as opposed to the traditional lab-based approach to microbiology. Microbial ecology is similar, but tend to focus more on lab studies and the relationships between organisms within a community, as well as within the ecosystem of their chemical and geological physical environment. Both rely on techniques such as sample collection from diverse environments, metagenomics, DNA sequencing, and statistics.\n\nGeomicrobiology traditionally studies the interactions between microbes and minerals. While it is generally reliant on the tools of microbiology, microbial geochemistry uses geological and chemical methods to approach the same topic from the perspective of the rocks. Geomicrobiology and microbial geochemistry (GMG) is a relatively new interdisciplinary field that more broadly takes on the relationship between microbes, Earth, and environmental systems. Billed as a subset of both geobiology and geochemistry, GMG seeks to understand elemental biogeochemical cycles and the evolution of life on Earth. Specifically, it asks questions about where microbes live, their local and global abundance, their structural and functional biochemistry, how they have evolved, biomineralization, and their preservation potential and presence in the rock record. In many ways, GMG appears to be equivalent to geobiology, but differs in scope: geobiology focuses on the role of all life, while GMG is strictly microbial. Regardless, it is these tiniest creatures that dominated to history of life integrated over time and seem to have had the most far-reaching effects.\n\nMolecular geomicrobiology takes a mechanistic approach to understanding biological processes that are geologically relevant. It can be at the level of DNA, protein, lipids, or any metabolite. One example of Molecular geomicrobiology research is studying how recently created lava fields are colonized by microbes. The University of Helskinki is currently conducting research to determine what specific microbial traits are necessary for successful initial colonization, and how waves of microbial succession can transform the volcanic rock into fertile soil. \n\nOrganic geochemistry is the study of organic molecules that appear in the fossil record in sedimentary rocks. Research in this field concerns molecular fossils that are often lipid biomarkers. Molecules like sterols and hopanoids, membrane lipids found in eukaryotes and bacteria, respectively, can be preserved in the rock record on billion-year timescales. Following the death of the organism they came from and sedimentation, they undergo a process called diagenesis whereby many of the specific functional groups from the lipids are lost, but the hydrocarbon skeleton remains intact. These fossilized lipids are called steranes and hopanes, respectively. There are also other types of molecular fossils, like porphyrins, the discovery of which in petroleum by Alfred E. Treibs actually led to the invention of the field. Other aspects of geochemistry that are also pertinent to geobiology include isotope geochemistry, in which scientists search for isotope fractionation in the rock record, and the chemical analysis of biominerals, such as magnetite or microbially-precipitated gold.\nPerhaps the oldest of the bunch, paleontology is the study of fossils. It involves the discovery, excavation, dating, and paleoecological understanding of any type of fossil, microbial or dinosaur, trace or body fossil. Micropaleontology is particularly relevant to geobiology. Putative bacterial microfossils and ancient stromatolites are used as evidence for the rise of metabolisms such as oxygenic photosynthesis. The search for molecular fossils, such as lipid biomarkers like steranes and hopanes, has also played an important role in geobiology and organic geochemistry. Relevant sub-disciples include paleoecology and paleobiogeoraphy.\n\nBiogeography is the study of the geographic distribution of life through time. It can look at the present distribution of organisms across continents or between microniches, or the distribution of organisms through time, or in the past, which is called paleobiogeography.\n\nEvolutionary biology is the study of the evolutionary processes that have shaped the diversity of life on Earth. It incorporates genetics, ecology, biogeography, and paleontology to analyze topics including natural selection, variance, adaptation, divergence, genetic drift, and speciation.\n\nEcohydrology is an interdisciplinary field studying the interactions between water and ecosystems. Stable isotopes of water are sometimes used as tracers of water sources and flow paths between the physical environment and the biosphere.\n\n"}

Vanderbilt fields 16 varsity teams (6 men's teams and 10 women's teams), 14 of which compete at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I level as a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Vanderbilt's women's lacrosse team plays in the American Athletic Conference. The bowling team plays in the Southland Bowling League. The University of Tennessee Volunteers are Vanderbilt's primary athletic rival, and the only other SEC team in Tennessee.\n\nVanderbilt is one of only two Power 5 schools that do not sponsor women's volleyball, the other one being Oklahoma State. In addition, Vanderbilt is the only school in the SEC that does not sponsor softball.\n\nBaseball has been a part of Vanderbilt athletics since its official debut in 1886. The sport started out as a two-game schedule which featured a draw between Vanderbilt and then conference rival Sewanee. As the number of games increased the game became more and more popular especially in 1921 when Vanderbilt (20-8) first reached twenty wins in a season and won the Southern Conference baseball championship. Manager Bill Schwartz who formerly coached the Nashville Vols (1917, 1924–40, 1952) helped bring Vanderbilt to national prominence. Under his reign he led the Commodores to a 155-112-1 record which still ranks third all-time in victories at Vanderbilt. Under the direction of Larry Schmittou (1968–1978) the Commodores found even more success as the 1971 team began a four-year streak as SEC Eastern Divisional Champs with a 34-19 record. He also guided Vanderbilt to back-to-back SEC conference titles in 1973 and 1974 while being awarded Coach-of-the-Year honors. Schmittou currently ranks second all-time in Vanderbilt wins (306-252-1) and has coached 20 All-SEC players, 14 of which were drafted in the MLB draft.\n\nTim Corbin (2003–present) has led Vanderbilt baseball into national prominence with players like Jeremy Sowers, David Price, Casey Weathers, Sonny Gray, Jensen Lewis and Pedro Álvarez. Vanderbilt's baseball team has enjoyed a great deal of success under his reign. The team qualified for the NCAA Super Regionals in 2004, had the nation's top recruiting class in 2005 according to \"Baseball America\" made the NCAA field again in 2006, and won the 2007 SEC regular-season and SEC tournament crowns. The Commodores were ranked first in most polls for a large portion of the 2007 season and earned the #1 national seed for the 2007 NCAA tournament. In 2011 the team was ranked as high as #1 for a good part of the season and won the SEC regular-season title. That year the team entered the NCAA Regionals with a #6 national seed and finally accomplished something that they had not done before by going undefeated through Regionals and Super Regionals to enter the College World Series for the first time. That year Vanderbilt also broke a SEC record of most players drafted in the MLB with 12 players, breaking Auburn's record of 11.\n\nVanderbilt won the 2014 College World Series, the school's first national championship in any men's sport. The team returned to the national championship series in 2015, finishing as runners up to Virginia.\n\nVanderbilt's 2019 baseball team compiled a 59-12 record and won the 2019 College World Series in addition to the SEC regular-season and tournament titles. Freshman Kumar Rocker was named the Most Outstanding Player of the College World Series and Freshman of the Year.\n\nVanderbilt basketball began on February 7, 1893 with a 9-6 victory over the Nashville YMCA, making it the first basketball game played by a collegiate team. It would take several years for the Commodores to make an impact in the game starting in December 1900 when the school first produced a formal basketball team coached by W.D. Weatherford. The first actual schedule for Vanderbilt consisted of three games against the Nashville YMCA and one against the Nashville Athletic Club. That year the Commodores lost their first meeting against the YMCA but managed to finish their season 2-2. The first modern and successful basketball team began with the hiring of Bob Polk (1948–58, 1960–61) as the school's first full-time basketball coach. During that time Polk was able to recruit Vanderbilt's first scholarship player Billy Joe Adcock who would later become Vanderbilt's first All-American. From 1982-1989 Vanderbilt found success under the coaching of C.M. Newton who was able to bring Vanderbilt to new heights. Newton's \"Bomb Squad\" which consisted of Scott Draud, Barry Booker and Barry Goheen managed to light up scoreboards with their explosive offense. In 1988 Vanderbilt managed to make it to the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA tournament with the help of center and SEC Player of the Year Will Perdue. Newton was a two-time SEC Coach of the Year and was able to coach other greats such as Phil Cox, Jeff Turner, and Frank Kornet. In 1990, coach Eddie Fogler (1990–93) led Vanderbilt to the NIT championship which still remains to be Vanderbilt's' only national tournament title. In 1992 the Commodores (28-6) managed to win its third and last SEC title and a trip to the Sweet Sixteen with the help of Duke transfer Billy McCaffrey. Presently, Kevin Stallings is in his eighth season leading the Commodores. Under his guidance Vanderbilt has appeared in two NIT's and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Tournament. In 2004 Matt Freije became the Commodores all-time leading scorer with 1,891 points. Since the 2000s Vanderbilt has been able to produce several important players including Greg LaPointe, Russell Lakey, Scott Hundley, Corey Smith, Mario Moore, Julian Terrell, Shan Foster, Derrick Byars (2007 SEC Player of the Year), John Jenkins, Festus Ezeli, and Jeffery Taylor.\n\nThe Vanderbilt men have an overall record entering the 2007-08 season of 1,378-995. Their home record in Memorial Gymnasium is an astonishing 650-184. They have made nine NCAA Tournament appearances including four in the Sweet Sixteen and one Elite Eight. The Commodores have made 11 NIT (18-10) appearances with one championship (1990) and one Runner-up (1994). The men's basketball program is one of three Division I programs to hit at least one 3-pointer in every game since the 3-point line was implemented in the 1986-1987 season. Princeton and UNLV are the other two.\n\nThe first Vanderbilt women's basketball game was in March 1897. During that time their schedule consisted of five games which expanded as the game became more popular nationally. The Lady Commodores began their modern and successful period when Joe Pepper (1977–80) was named part-time coach. Phil Lee (1980–91) became the school's first full-time coach in 1980 and helped lead the Lady Dores to their first 20 win season in 1981 and an appearance in the AIAW Women's Basketball Tournament. The Vanderbilt women captured the WNIT championship in 1984 and later made their first appearance in the NCAA Tournament in 1986 while finishing the season ranked No. 20. The Vanderbilt women soon became one of the top SEC teams and were consistently ranked nationally. Coach Jim Foster (1992–2002) brought the Vanderbilt women to new heights and national prominence with his hiring. Vanderbilt advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA Tournament in eight of his 11 seasons. In 1993, the Commodores were able to advance to the Final Four before falling to eventual champion Texas Tech. Vanderbilt managed to receive a No.1 ranking in the poll taken before the tournament. Foster's teams also won three SEC Tournaments in 1993, 1995, and 2002. Melanie Balcomb became Vanderbilt's fourth coach in May 2002. She has taken the Commodores to the NCAA Tournament in each of her six seasons and added SEC Tournament titles in 2004 and 2007.\n\nThe Commodores have an overall record of 623-307 record entering the 2007-08 season. Their Memorial Gymnasium all-time mark is 344-81. The Commodores have appeared in 20 NCAA tournaments (third most in the SEC) and have 12 Sweet Sixteen appearances.\n\nThe first game in Vanderbilt Commodores football history was in 1890 when they met the University of Nashville. Four years later, Vanderbilt became one of the seven founding members of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association. During those years, Vanderbilt was often a major player in southern football dominating many teams. In 1932, Vandy became a founding member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The original teams of the SEC consisted of Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Georgia, Ole Miss, Tennessee, Mississippi State, LSU, Auburn, Sewanee, Tulane, and Georgia Tech. Vanderbilt's primary rivalries consist of the Tennessee Volunteers and the Ole Miss Rebels.\n\nIn Vanderbilt Commodores football history, there have been several coaches who have been honored with College Football Hall of Fame honors. Some of those coaches often returned to the school to continue the success they found there. This list includes Dan McGugin, who coached from 1904-1917 and 1919-1934; Ray Morrison, who not only played for the Commodores but also coached for the Commodores from 1936-1939; and Red Sanders, who led the Commodores from 1940-1942 and 1946-1948, and Paul \"Bear\" Bryant prior to his becoming head football coach at Alabama. Over the years, Vanderbilt has sent a numerous players to the NFL. One of the most notable football players is Jay Cutler, who served as quarterback and offensive captain for the Commodores. He was selected as the 11th overall pick in the 2006 NFL Draft and went on to play for the Denver Broncos. While at Vanderbilt, he started more than 40 consecutive games and set school records in touchdowns and rushing yards.\n\nThe rapidly expanding and successful climbing team at Vanderbilt was founded in 2017 and is competing in the Appalachian region of the USA Climbing Collegiate Series. The American collegiate climbing scene has grown by a staggering amount since the advent of modern climbing gyms and the addition of climbing in the Summer Olympic Games. At the 2019 USA Climbing Collegiate National Championships, where over 100 teams attended, Vanderbilt placed 3rd in speed climbing and 13th overall. There are currently over 50 active team members, who compete in all three disciplines - bouldering, speed climbing and lead climbing. The club roster has over 200 undergraduate as well as graduate & professional students.\n\nFounded in 2008, the Vanderbilt University Club Baseball team competes in the Mid-Atlantic conference of NCBA Division 1 in the West division. In the 2012-2013 season, opponents included clubs in the division (Appalachian State University, UNC Charlotte, University of Kentucky, and University of Tennessee) and others out of conference. The 2012-2013 roster included 26 undergraduate and graduate students, including 12 freshmen and 2 graduating seniors.\n\nFounded in 1970, Vanderbilt University Rugby Football Club plays in the Division 1 Southeastern Collegiate Rugby Conference against its traditional SEC rivals such as Tennessee and Ole Miss. Vanderbilt had previously played in Division 2, where it was one of the stronger teams. Every fall Vanderbilt hosts the Oak Leaf Cup tournament. Vanderbilt is led by head coach James Snell.\n\nFounded in 1985, Vanderbilt Rowing Club competes in the Southeastern Intercollegiate Rowing Association Conference (SIRA) and the American Collegiate Rowing Association Nationals (ACRA) yearly. Vanderbilt Rowing won a national championship in the Varsity Women's 4 race at the ACRA National Championships in 2018.\n\nVanderbilt has won five NCAA team national championships.\n\n\n\nVanderbilt is a charter member of the Southeastern Conference and is the conference's only private school. With approximately 6,400 undergraduates, the school is also by far the smallest in the conference; the University of Mississippi, the next smallest, has nearly twice as many undergraduate students. Vanderbilt fields fewer teams than any of its rivals and sometimes lacks the national prominence enjoyed by schools such as the University of Florida or the University of Kentucky. Men's and women's tennis and men's and women's basketball are traditionally Vanderbilt's strongest sports, with the more recently founded women's lacrosse and bowling programs as well as the long-standing men's baseball program experiencing national success, winning the 2014 College World Series. After enjoying success in the first half of the 20th century, the football program struggled through the beginning of the 21st century. In the 2008–09 season, however, the Vanderbilt football team posted a winning season and won its first bowl game in 53 years. Under previous coach James Franklin, the football program enjoyed somewhat of a renaissance; since Franklin's arrival at Vanderbilt in 2011, the Commodores have appeared in consecutive bowl games for the first time in school history (2011 and 2012), and the 2012 team posted Vanderbilt's first 9-win season in over 80 years.\n\nIn September 2003, Vanderbilt disbanded its athletic department. Intercollegiate athletics are now administered as a part of the university's Division of Student Life, which oversees all student organizations and activities. Vanderbilt is currently the only Division I school without a separate athletic department. In making this decision, Chancellor Gordon Gee cited a need to reform college athletics, returning the emphasis to the student half of student-athletes.\n\nVanderbilt's intercollegiate athletics teams are nicknamed the Commodores, in honor of the nickname given to Cornelius Vanderbilt, who made his fortune in shipping. Fans often refer to Vanderbilt athletic teams as \"Dores\" or use the cheer \"Go Dores!\"\n\nThe term \"commodore\" was used by the Navy during the mid- to late nineteenth century. A commodore was the commanding officer of a task force of ships, and therefore higher in rank than a captain but lower in rank than an admiral. It was the highest rank in the United States Navy until the Civil War. The closest warfighting rank in today's Navy is rear admiral lower half. (In the British Royal Navy, the designation of commodore was applied to the commanding officer.)\n\nSince the term was used most during the late nineteenth century—and because it was then that Cornelius received his nickname—Vanderbilt's mascot is always portrayed as a naval officer from the 1880s, complete with chops, cutlass, and nineteenth-century naval regalia.\n\nThe school colors are black and gold. Opinions vary as to the reason for selecting black and gold as the colors for Vanderbilt's teams. Some say the original colors were orange and black, given to the university by Judge W.L. Granbery of Princeton. Others say that Commodore Vanderbilt's legacy was called upon to develop school colors for the university that bears his name: black for the magnate's control of coal and gold for his money.\n\nWhen questioned about the subject in the 1930s, the few remaining members of the school's first football squad from 1890 did not recall why they suddenly began appearing in black and gold. Whatever the source of the colors, by 1892, the Commodores were known by the colors that Vanderbilt fans still wear today.\n\nVanderbilt's primary rival in almost every sport is the University of Tennessee. There is also a rivalry with the University of Kentucky in basketball. In addition, the Commodores' second-oldest rivalry is with Ole Miss, and the two schools play each other every year as SEC cross-division \"permanent opponents\". In addition, Vanderbilt and the University of Louisville of the ACC play for the \"Battle of the Barrel\" each year in baseball.\n\nFormed by extending the thumb, index, and middle fingers of the hand (similar to the Serbian three-finger salute), the resulting shape forms a \"V\" and \"U\". It was introduced by Vanderbilt's cheerleaders in 2003.\n\nVanderbilt has a number of football traditions: the \"Commodore Creed\" in the football locker room; the \"Corridor of Captains\" that honors Vanderbilt's athletics history; the \"Star Walk\" with fans, cheerleaders, and the Spirit of Gold Marching Band; the \"Star V,\" an on-field formation by the marching band; the \"Admiral\", a foghorn from a U.S. Navy battleship that blows after every Vanderbilt score; \"Mr. C,\" the mascot; the \"Anchor Dash\" by first-year students rushing the football field before kickoff of each season's home opener; the \"Victory Flag\" that is raised over Dudley Field after home wins; and the singing of the \"Alma Mater\" at the conclusion of a game (in most sports), win or lose.\n\nThe Vanderbilt fight song, \"Dynamite,\" was written by student Francis Craig in 1924. The song references the vigor with which Vanderbilt plays and the enthusiasm of the university's fans, who cheer regardless of the outcome of the game.\n\nVanderbilt's athletics programs have seen more success in recent years, and 2006–2007 was one of the best in the school's athletic history. At one point, seven of Vanderbilt's 16 teams were ranked in the Top 25 of their respective sports. Women's bowling won the NCAA championship, bringing the university its first team championship since the advent of the NCAA. In 2014, the baseball team won its first College World Series over the Virginia Cavaliers. In 2015, the Vanderbilt women's tennis team won its first national championship by defeating the defending champions UCLA Bruins. In 2018, the women's bowling team won its second national championship by defeating the defending champions McKendree University. And in 2019, the baseball team won its second College World Series title.\n\nCampus athletic facilities include:\n\n"}
{"id": "1962252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962252", "title": "1969 NFL playoffs", "text": "1969 NFL playoffs\n\nThe NFL playoffs following the 1969 NFL season determined the league's representative in Super Bowl IV.\n\nThis was the last NFL playoff tournament before the AFL–NFL merger and the last awarding of the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy to the NFL champion, which was introduced in 1934.\n\nThe four-team postseason format was introduced for the season, when the NFL expanded to 16 teams and realigned into four division with four teams each.\n\nWithin each conference, the two division winners qualified for the playoffs. In the first round, the Capitol winner met the Century winner in the Eastern Conference game, while the Coastal and Central played for the Western Conference title. The winners of the two conference games advanced to the NFL Championship Game to compete for the NFL league title and the right to face the American Football League champion in Super Bowl IV. The losers of the conference championship games played in the Playoff Bowl, a third place game at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida; the Playoff Bowl of January 1970 was its tenth and final edition.\n\nPrior to , the playoff sites rotated and were known prior to the start of the season. In , the hosts were the Capitol and Central division winners for the conference championships (first round), and the Western Conference for the championship game. This gave home field advantage to the Central Division winner, the Minnesota Vikings (12–2), which had the league's best record. The previous year's playoff hosts were Century, Coastal, and Eastern, respectively, and 1967 was like 1969. All three playoff games in 1969 were hosted by the team with the better regular season record.\n\n<br>\n\nThree weeks prior to this game, the teams met in Los Angeles in a battle between the undefeated (11–0) Rams and the 10–1 Vikings. The Vikings won that game 20–13. The rematch was played in the cold and snow of Minnesota. Despite committing more turnovers (3 to 1) and only gaining 20 more total yards (275-255), the Vikings managed to edge out the Rams for their first postseason win in franchise history.\n\nIn the game in L.A., the Viking defense shut down the Rams' wide receivers and outside running game, so in this game, the Rams attacked the middle of the Viking defense and neutralized the Viking pass rush with short quick passes to the tight ends. The Rams defense held Minnesota's high powered offense in check, with the \"Fearsome Foursome\" defensive line harassing Viking QB Joe Kapp. Early on, the momentum seemed to be in LA's favor. Rams safety Richie Petitbon recovered a fumble from fullback Bill Brown that gave his team a first down on the Minnesota 45-yard line. On the next play, it appeared that the Vikings took a quick lead as Carl Eller intercepted a Roman Gabriel pass and returned for a touchdown but the score was nullified on an offside penalty on Alan Page. Taking advantage of their second chance, running back Larry Smith gained 19 yards on three carries, and Gabriel eventually finished the drive with a 3-yard touchdown pass to tight end Bob Klein. The Vikings quickly stormed back, with Kapp completing four consecutive passes on a 10-play, 75-yard drive. Three of the completions were to receiver Gene Washington for 49 total yards, including a 27-yard reception that gave the Vikings the ball on the Rams' 4-yard line. Dave Osborn ran for a touchdown on the next play, tying the score at 7 with a little over 3 minutes left in the first quarter.\n\nLA moved the ball effectively on their next drive, but it ended on a missed 38-yard field goal attempt by Bruce Gossett. The next time they got the ball, they did much better, taking up the majority of the second quarter, including a 13-yard run by Gabriel to convert a third down. Gossett finished the drive with a 20-yard field goal to put the Rams up 10-7 with 4:30 left before halftime. Following a punt, Gabriel led his team back for more points. This time he completed passes to tight end Billy Truax for gains of 18 and 16 yards before finishing the 13-play, 65-yard drive with a 2-yard touchdown pass to Truax. The Rams went into halftime leading 17-7, having scored on three of their four first half possessions.\n\nIn the second half, Viking coach Bud Grant adjusted his defense to stop the Ram tight ends, and his \"Purple People Eaters\" continued to punish the Ram running game. They also got increasing pressure on Gabriel. On offense, Grant neutralized the Ram pass rush by having QB Kapp run the ball, either on designed plays like quarterback draws or roll outs, or by instructing him to take off and run at the first sign of pressure. Kapp began frustrating the Rams with runs; this threat caused their pass rush to be less aggressive.\n\nAfter forcing the Rams to punt for the first time in the game on the opening possession of the second half, Kapp completed a 41-yard pass to Washington on the LA 12-yard line. After a Rams penalty and a 5-yard run by Kapp, Osborn finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run that cut Minnesota's deficit to 17-14. However, Minnesota's comeback attempt suffered major setbacks over the next few drives against a punishing effort from the Rams defense. The next time the Vikings got the ball, they drove deep into Rams territory, only to have Kapp throw an interception to safety Ed Meador on the LA 4-yard line. Meador fumbled the ball during the return, but linebacker Jim Purnell recovered it. After an LA punt, Kapp was intercepted again, this time by Petitbon, who returned the ball 4 yards to the Vikings' 36. Once again, the Viking defense bent but didn't break, stopping the Rams inside the 10 yard line and making them settle for a 27-yard Gossett field goal. So instead of being down 24–14, it was only 20–14 going into the fourth quarter.\n\nKapp subsequently marched the Vikings 65 yards downfield, completing three passes for 40 yards and going the final 2 yards himself as Minnesota took its first lead of the game, 21–20, with 8:24 on the clock. Then the Viking defense took over. After their special teams unit tackled returner Ron Smith on the 12-yard line during the ensuing kickoff, Carl Eller sacked Gabriel in the end zone for a safety, giving the Vikings a 23–20 lead and the ball. But the Rams defense held, and 1969 NFL MVP Gabriel began to march the Rams down field in the last two minutes. As they crossed midfield, it appeared the Rams might get the tying field goal or winning touchdown, but a Gabriel pass was tipped and intercepted at the Viking 40-yard line by Alan Page with 30 seconds left, allowing his team to run out the clock and win.\n\nGabriel completed 22/30 passes for 150 yards and two touchdowns, with 1 interception, while also rushing for 26 yards. Larry Smith was the top rusher of the game with 11 carries for 60 yards, and he caught 6 passes for 36. Kapp completed 12/19 passes for 196 yards with 2 interceptions, while also rushing for 41 yards and a touchdown. Washington caught 4 passes for 90 yards.\n\nFor the second year in a row, Cleveland eliminated Dallas from the playoffs, this time outgaining them in total yards 344 to 217 and forcing 3 turnovers, without losing any themselves.\n\nCleveland dominated the first half, holding Dallas to just 17 plays and 39 total yards. They had to punt after taking the opening kickoff, but Don Cockroft's high short kick ended up bouncing off the leg of Dallas lineman Rayfield Wright and linebacker Bob Matheson recovered for the Browns on the Cowboys' 34-yard line. Cleveland then drove to their first score on a 2-yard touchdown run by Bo Scott. The Browns later increased their lead to 14–0 by driving 55 yards to score on Bill Nelsen's 6-yard touchdown pass to tight end Milt Morin. Cockroft missed two field goal attempts, but just before the end of the half, Ron Widby's 27-yard punt gave the Browns the ball on the Cowboys' 34-yard line, setting up Cockroft's 29-yard field goal that gave Cleveland a 17–0 halftime lead.\n\nEarly in the third quarter, Browns linebacker Jim Houston intercepted Craig Morton's pass and returned it 35 yards to the Dallas 19, leading to Scott's second 2-yard touchdown run to make the score 24–0. This time Dallas was able to respond, driving 72 yards in 12 plays, including a 26-yard catch by tight end Pettis Norman, to score on Morton's 2-yard touchdown run.\n\nHowever, 24–7 was as close as the score would get. In the 4th quarter, a 39-yard burst by Browns running back Leroy Kelly (the longest gain of the day for either team) set up his 1-yard touchdown plunge to give the Browns a 31–7 lead. Dallas had a chance to score after a punt play when Cockroft bobbled a low snap from rookie center Chuck Reynolds and was tackled on the Browns' 22-yard line. But faced with 4th down from the 18 after 7 plays, Morton threw a short pass intended for Walt Garrison that was intercepted by rookie defensive back Walt Sumner, who took off for an 88-yard touchdown return.\n\nThe only notable thing remaining in the game would be the playoff debut of 27-year old rookie Dallas quarterback Roger Staubach. He got off to a shaky start, throwing an interception that was eliminated by a Browns holding penalty, but managed to lead the Cowboys to a touchdown, rushing three times for 22 yards and completing passes to Lance Rentzel for gains of 14 and 22 yards before finding him in the end zone for a 5-yard scoring pass.\n\nNelsen completed 18/27 passes for 219 yards and a touchdown. His top receiver was Paul Warfield, who caught 8 passes for 99 yards. Kelly had 66 rushing yards, 10 receiving yards, and a touchdown. Morton was held to just 8/24 completions for 92 yards, with two interceptions that were both converted into Cleveland touchdowns.\n\nCleveland had lost the previous season's NFL title game 34–0, and this time fared little better. The Vikings dominated the game, racking up 381 yards without losing a single turnover, while Cleveland gained just 268 yards and turned the ball over three times.\n\nThe Vikings took a lead just four minutes into the first quarter, driving 70 yards for a touchdown in 8 plays. The key play of the drive was a pass from Joe Kapp to receiver Gene Washington that was nearly 5 yards short of the mark. Despite the short throw, Washington was able to come back and haul it in for a 33-yard gain to the Browns' 24-yard line. Two plays later, Dave Osborn's 12-yard run moved the ball to the 7. Then two plays after that, Bill Brown accidentally slipped and bumped into Kapp while moving up to take a handoff, but Kapp simply kept the ball himself and ran it 7 yards for a touchdown.\n\nThe situation never got any better for Cleveland. The next time Minnesota got the ball, defensive back Erich Barnes slipped while in one-on-one coverage with Washington, enabling him to catch a pass from Kapp and take off for a 75-yard touchdown completion. Near the end of the first quarter, Browns running back Leroy Kelly lost a fumble that was recovered by linebacker Wally Hilgenberg on the Cleveland 43. Kapp then completed a 12-yard pass to Washington before Fred Cox finished the drive with a 30-yard field goal, putting the Vikings up 17–0. Later in the second period, Hilgenberg snuffed out a Cleveland scoring threat by intercepting a pass from Bill Nelsen on the Vikings' 33-yard line. Minnesota subsequently drove 67 yards in 8 plays. Kapp started the drive with a pair of completions to John Henderson for 17 total yards, while Osborn broke off a 16-yard run and ended up finishing the drive with a 20-yard touchdown burst, giving the Vikings a 24–0 lead with 4:46 left in the first half. Cleveland responded with a drive to the Vikings' 17, but turned the ball over on downs when Nelsen overthrew receiver Gary Collins in the end zone on 4th and 3.\n\nThe third quarter was mostly uneventful, other than Cox's 32-yard field goal that gave Minnesota a 27–0 lead after an 11-play, 80-yard drive. The most noteworthy play was a 13-yard scramble by Kapp in which he plowed into 240-pound Browns linebacker Jim Houston so hard that Houston was knocked out of the game. In the 4th quarter, Cleveland finally got on the board when a diving 18-yard reception by Paul Warfield set up Nelsen's 3-yard touchdown pass to Collins. There were still 13 minutes on the clock at this point, but there would be no more scoring. The Vikings had a drive to the Cleveland 2-yard line, but decided to let the clock run out instead of going for another score.\n\nKapp completed just 7/13 passes, but threw for 169 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 57 yards and another score. Osborn rushed 18 times for 108 yards and a touchdown. Washington had 120 yards and a touchdown on just 3 receptions. Kelly was the Browns' top rusher with 80 yards, while also catching two passes for 17. Nelsen completed just 17 of 33 passes for 181 yards, with one touchdown and two interceptions.\n"}

CD-V discs are the same size as a standard 12-cm audio CD, and contain up to 20 minutes' worth of CD Audio that can be played on any audio CD player. It also contains up to 5 minutes of LaserDisc video information with digital CD-quality sound, which can be played back on a newer LaserDisc player capable of playing CD-V discs. \n\nOne of the first LaserDisc players that can play CD-V discs is the Pioneer CLD-1010 from 1987. Though it is a CD-based format, CD Video was never given a rainbow book designation; the idea of encoding analogue video, which is incompatible between different regions, was poorly received by CD stakeholders other than Philips, who had not consulted them prior to demonstrating the format to the music industry.\n\nCD Video discs have a distinctive gold color, to differentiate them from regular silver-colored audio CDs. This is a characteristic that would later be replicated in HVD, a more advanced disc format.\n\nA similar version of CD Video called Video Single Disc (VSD) was also released. It is basically the same as CD Video, but it only has the analog video track (occupying the whole storage space of the disc), so it is in effect a small LaserDisc.\n\nCD Video was targeted toward teenagers who watched music videos on MTV. However, few of them were familiar with LaserDiscs, and far fewer owned CDV-compatible players at the time. Buying a costly new player was not an option just for the minor use of playing a single music video more easily accessible through a VHS videocassette, either purchased pre-recorded or recorded off a television programme with a VCR.\n\nThe term \"CD Video\" and its logo were also used on some full-size (8- and 12-inch) LaserDiscs with digital audio (for movies as well as for music titles), to distinguish them from the previous LaserVision format with analog audio and, presumably, to leverage the consumer recognition of the successful CD-Audio format.\n\nThough CD Video lasted only a few years in the marketplace and began disappearing by 1991, its legacy would live on with the all-digital MPEG-based Video CD format, which came out a few years later in 1993.\n\n"}

He has released two solo albums, titled Enter By the Twelfth Gate (2004) and Ascension (2014), of mostly instrumental, classical-styled progressive metal. Michael is one of two Symphony X members to appear on all nine of the band's albums (the other being Michael Romeo).\n\nPinnella was born in Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey and was encouraged since childhood to follow music. When he was four years old, he started taking piano lessons. He was heavily influenced by classic composers like Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, and Bach.\n\nWhen he was about 11 years old, he started to practice more seriously. Later in his youth, he was impressed by Yngwie Malmsteen and asked his parents to buy him a keyboard. When he got into college, he studied piano performance, theory and composition, and other musical courses. Other influences came from progressive/metal bands from the 1970s (Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath) and from the 1980s (DIO, Ozzy Osbourne).\n\nWhen Pinnella finished college, he started teaching piano in a music store. One of the fellow teachers at the store was friends with Michael Romeo from Symphony X. In 1994, he was hired by the band as a keyboardist.\n\nHe is currently working in East Brunswick, NJ when not touring or recording.\n\nPinnella's nephew, Chris Pinnella, is a vocalist who worked with Trans-Siberian Orchestra.\n\nPinnella uses the following equipment:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1962277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962277", "title": "Hwang Woo-suk", "text": "Hwang Woo-suk\n\nHwang Woo-suk (, born January 29, 1953) is a South Korean veterinarian and researcher. He was a professor of theriogenology and biotechnology at Seoul National University (dismissed on March 20, 2006) who became infamous for fabricating a series of experiments, which appeared in high-profile journals, in the field of stem cell research. Until November 2005, he was considered one of the pioneering experts in the field, best known for two articles published in the journal \"Science\" in 2004 and 2005 where he reported he had succeeded in creating human embryonic stem cells by cloning. He was called the \"Pride of Korea\" in South Korea.\n\nSoon after the first paper was released, however, an article in the journal \"Nature\" charged Hwang with having committed ethical violations by using eggs from his graduate students and from the black market. Although he denied the charges at first, Hwang admitted the allegations were true in November 2005. Shortly after that his human cloning experiments were revealed to be fraudulent.\n\nOn May 12, 2006, Hwang was charged with embezzlement and bioethics law violations after it emerged much of his stem cell research had been faked. The \"Korea Times\" reported on June 10, 2007, that Seoul National University fired him, and the South Korean government canceled his financial support and barred him from engaging in stem cell research. While being charged with fraud and embezzlement, he has kept a relatively low profile at the Sooam Bioengineering Research Institute in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, where he currently leads research efforts on creating cloned pig embryos and using them to make embryonic stem-cell lines.\n\nSince the controversy subsided, despite the history and his lost credibility as a scientist, Hwang's lab has been actively publishing manuscripts, many of which have appeared on PubMed, the online database for biomedical research. In February 2011, Hwang visited Libya as part of a $133 million project in the North African country to build a stem cell research center and transfer relevant technology. However, the project was canceled due to civil war.\n\nHwang was sentenced to a two years suspended prison sentence at the Seoul Central District Court on 26 October 2009, after being found guilty of embezzlement and bioethical violations but cleared of fraud. On this same day, CNN reported that the scientist in 2006 admitted faking his findings, after questions of impropriety had emerged. He had his conviction upheld on 15 December 2010 by an appeals court in South Korea, which resulted in his suspended sentence being reduced by 6 months. In 2014 the South Korean Supreme Court upheld its 2010 ruling.\n\nOn November 2015, a Chinese biotech company Boyalife Group announced that it will partner with Hwang's laboratory, Sooam Biotech, to open the world's largest animal cloning factory in Tianjin as early as 2016. The factory will aim to produce up to one million cattle embryos per year to meet the increasing demand for quality beef in China.\n\nHwang first caught media attention in South Korea when he announced he successfully created a cloned dairy cow, \"Yeongrong-i\" in February 1999. His alleged success was touted as the fifth instance in the world in cow cloning, with a notable caveat: Hwang failed to provide scientifically verifiable data for the research, giving only media sessions and photo-ops. Hwang's next claim came only two months later in April 1999, when he announced the cloning of a Korean cow, \"Jin-i\", also without providing any scientifically verifiable data. Despite the notable absence of any of the scientific data needed to probe the validity of the research, Hwang's several claims were well received by the South Korean media and public, who were attracted by Hwang's claim of immeasurable economic prospect that his research was said to be promising. The claims of his research results resulted in him receiving the Scientist of the Year Award by the Korea Science Journalists Association. Until 2004, Hwang's main area of research remained in creating genetically modified livestock that included cows and pigs. During that period, Hwang claimed to have created a BSE-resistant cow (which has not been verified) and also stated his intention to clone a Siberian tiger.\n\nIn February 2004, Hwang and his team announced that they had successfully created an embryonic stem cell with the somatic cell nuclear transfer method, and published their paper in the March 12 issue of \"Science\". Although Hwang had already established himself as an expert in animal cloning and secured celebrity status in South Korea in the late 90s, his alleged sudden success came as a surprise because this was the first reported success in human somatic cell cloning. Until Hwang's claim, it was generally agreed that creating a human stem cell by cloning was next to impossible due to the complexity of primates. Hwang explained that his team used 242 eggs to create a single cell line.\n\nIn May, \"Nature\" magazine published an article stating that Hwang had used eggs taken from two of his graduate students, based on an interview with one of the students. The article raised the question of whether the students might have been pressured to give eggs and thus whether such a donation would have been \"voluntary\" as Hwang claimed in his scientific paper. At that time, Hwang denied that he had used his students' eggs.\n\nHwang's team announced an even greater achievement a year later in May 2005, and claimed they had created 11 human embryonic stem cells using 185 eggs. His work, published in the June 17 issue of \"Science\", was instantly hailed as a breakthrough in biotechnology because the cells were allegedly created with somatic cells from patients of different age and gender, while the stem cell of 2004 was created with eggs and somatic cells from a single female donor. This meant every patient could receive custom-made treatment with no immune reactions. In addition, Hwang's claim meant that his team had boosted their success rate by 14 times and that this technology could be medically viable.\n\nHwang made further headlines in May 2005 when he criticized U.S. President George W. Bush's policy on embryonic stem cell research. Also, Time magazine named Hwang one of its \"People Who Mattered 2004\", stating that Hwang \"has already proved that human cloning is no longer science fiction, but a fact of life.\"\n\nFollowing on the earlier success, on August 3, 2005, Hwang announced that his team of researchers had become the first team to successfully clone a dog, which has been independently verified through genetic testing. The dog, an Afghan Hound, was named \"Snuppy\".\n\nShortly after his groundbreaking 2005 work, Hwang was appointed to head the new World Stem Cell Hub, a facility that was to be the world's leading stem cell research centre. However, in November 2005, Gerald Schatten, a University of Pittsburgh researcher who had worked with Hwang for two years, made the surprise announcement that he had ceased his collaboration with Hwang. In an interview, Schatten commented that \"my decision is grounded solely on concerns regarding oocyte (egg) donations in Hwang's research reported in 2004.\" Following an intense media probe, Roh Sung-il, one of Hwang's close collaborators and head of \"MizMedi Women's Hospital\", held a news conference on November 21.\n\nDuring the conference Roh admitted that he had paid women US$1,400 each for donating their eggs, eggs that were later used in Hwang's research. However, Roh claimed Hwang was unaware of this, while the South Korean Ministry of Health assured that no laws or ethical guidelines had been breached as there were no commercial interests involved in this payout. Hwang maintained that he was unaware that these actions were happening during the research and he resigned from his post.\n\nOn November 22, \"PD Su-cheop\" (\"PD Notebook\"), a popular MBC investigative reporting show, raised the possibility of unethical conduct in the egg cell acquiring process. Despite the factual accuracy of the report, news media as well as people caught up in nationalistic fervor in their unwavering support for Hwang asserted that criticism of Hwang's work was \"unpatriotic\", so much so that the major companies who were sponsoring the show immediately withdrew their support.\n\nOn November 24, Hwang held a press conference in Seoul, in which he declared his intention of resigning from most of his official posts.\n\nHe also apologized for his actions. In the interview he said, \"I was blinded by work and my drive for achievement.\" He denied coercing his researchers into donating eggs and claimed that he found out about the situation only after it had occurred.\n\nHe added that he had lied about the source of the eggs donated to protect the privacy of his female researchers, and that he was not aware of the Declaration of Helsinki, which clearly enumerates his actions as a breach of ethical conduct.\n\nAfter the press conference, which was aired on all major South Korean television networks, most of the nation's media outlets, government ministries, and the public gave support to Hwang. Sympathy for Hwang poured out, resulting in an increase in the number of women who wanted to donate their eggs for Hwang's research.\n\nOn December 29, 2005, the university determined that all 11 of Hwang's stem cell lines were fabricated. The university announced on January 10, 2006, that Hwang's 2004 and 2005 papers on \"Science\" were both fabricated. Following on the confirmation of scientific misconduct, on January 11, \"Science\" retracted both of Hwang's papers on unconditional terms.\n\nOn January 12, 2006, Hwang held a press conference to apologize for the entire fiasco, but still did not admit to cheating. Instead, he explicitly put the blame on other members of his research project for having deceived him with false data and alleged a conspiracy, saying that his projects had been sabotaged and that there was theft of materials involved. He said that cloning human stem cells was possible and that he had the technology to do it, and if he were given six more months he could prove it. This is an extension of the ten days he said he needed to re-create the stem cells that he asked for back on December 16, 2005. Seoul prosecutors raided his home that day for files and evidence, to start a criminal investigation of Hwang.\n\nOn January 20, 2006, Hwang maintained that two of his 11 forged stem cell lines had been maliciously switched for cells from regular, not cloned, embryos. The allegation involves the lines Hwang claims to have created at Seoul-based MizMedi Hospital.\n\nIn November 22, 2016 Hwang received a certificate of patent on NT-1 technology by the Korean Intellectual Property Office.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the method that scientists used in cloning was somatic cell nuclear transfer, which is the same procedure that was used to create Dolly the sheep. This laboratory technique begins when an egg is taken from a donor and the nucleus is removed from the egg, creating an enucleated egg. A cell, which contains DNA, is then taken from the animal being cloned. The enucleated egg is then fused together with the nucleus of the cloning subject's cell using electricity. This creates an embryo, which is implanted into a surrogate mother through in vitro fertilization. If the procedure is successful, then the surrogate mother will give birth to a baby that is a clone of the cloning subject at the end of a normal gestation period. In 2014 researchers were reporting cloning success rates of seven to eight out of ten but in 1996 it took 277 attempts to create Dolly.\n\nHwang allegedly used this technique at his laboratory in SNU to clone dogs during his experiments throughout the early 2000s. He claimed that it was possible to clone mammals and that probability for success can be better than 1 in 277 attempts (as in similar cases such as Dolly). Hwang was the first in the world to clone a dog, an Afghan hound called Snuppy in 2005. He described his procedure for cloning in the journal \"Nature\". Researchers from the Seoul National University and the US National Institutes of Health confirmed that Snuppy was a clone. Since then Hwang and his associates have cloned many more dogs. In 2015, it was reported that Huang Woo-suk's company Sooam Biotech had produced 700 cloned puppies since 2005 with their owners paying about $100,000 each to have their dogs cloned.\n\nHwang's intention to develop better technique for cloning was focused on stem cells\nbecause they are still at an early stage of development and retain the potential to turn into many different types of cell and when they divide, each new cell has the potential to either remain a stem cell or become another type of cell with a more specialized function.\n\nAccording to stem cell biologists, it might be possible to harness this ability to turn stem cells into a super \"repair kit\" for the body, theoretically to use stem cells to generate healthy tissue to replace that either damaged by trauma or compromised by disease.\nThe many conditions and illnesses that may eventually be treated by stem cell therapy include Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, diabetes, burns, and spinal cord damage.\n\nIn March 2012, it was announced that Hwang would collaborate with Russian scientists in an attempt to clone a woolly mammoth from remains found in Siberia. He had previously successful cloned eight coyotes in March 2011 using domestic dogs as surrogate mothers and grey wolves. However finding a mammoth sample fit for cloning has been unsuccessful as of 2015.\n\nIn 2015, the Chinese company BoyaLife announced that in partnership with the Hwang Woo-suk's company Sooam Biotech, they were planning to build a 200 million RMB (about US$32 million) factory in Tianjin, China to produce 100,000 cloned cattle per year, starting in 2016 to supply China's growing market for quality beef.\n\nIn 2015, Sooam Biotech cloned a male boxer puppy from a pet dog that had been dead for 12 days. This was the first time they had cloned a dog that had been dead for such a long time.\n\nIn 2016, Hwang's company was regularly cloning pigs which were genetically predisposed to certain diseases so that they could be used for testing pharmaceuticals and cloning cattle which were highly valued for their meat. In total Sooam Biotech was reported to be producing roughly 500 cloned embryos a day from various species. They were also reported to be attempting to clone the Ethiopian wolf, one of the world's rarest canids, of which there are only 500 in the wild, another endangered canid, the Dhole, of which there only about 2,500 adults and the Siberian musk deer which is classified as vulnerable by the IUCN.\n\nUntil late November 2005, Hwang was criticized only for unpublicized ethical violations. Colleagues and media outlets asserted that he had paid female donors for egg donations and that he had received donations from two junior researchers, both of which were violations. Later controversies would center around scientific misconduct.\n\nHis team, which cloned the first human embryo to use for research, said they had used the same technology to create batches of embryonic stem cells from nine patients. According to Hwang, the result was much more efficient than they had hoped.\nHwang's integrity as a researcher was again put in doubt when it was revealed that \"PD Su-cheop\" scheduled a follow-up report questioning his achievement published in \"Science\" in June 2005, which stated he had cloned 11 lines of embryonic stem cells. This caused furious backlash among many South Koreans, and the reaction only intensified when it was discovered that Kim Sun-Jong, one of Hwang's researchers from MizMedi, was coerced by illegal means to testify against Hwang. As a result, the scheduled broadcast was canceled and the network even made a public apology to the nation, everyone more or less operating under the assumption that the show was at fault and not Hwang. Yet, other news outlets began to question Hwang's claims.\n\nClose scrutiny revealed that several of the photos of purportedly different cells were in fact photos of the same cell. Hwang responded that these additional photos were accidentally included and that there was no such duplication in the original submission to \"Science\". This was later confirmed by the journal.\n\nResearchers raised questions about striking similarities between the DNA profiles of the cloned cells. Then collaborator Gerald Schatten asked \"Science\" to remove his name from the paper, stating as a reason that there were \"allegations from someone involved with the experiments that certain elements of the report may be fabricated.\"\n\nIn the midst of national confusion, Hwang disappeared from public sight, to be hospitalized days later for alleged stress-related fatigue, while public opinion gradually began to turn against Hwang with even the major Korean companies who pulled their support from \"PD Su-Cheop\" reportedly now less than pleased with Hwang. Days later, Hwang started going to his laboratory while requesting Seoul National University to officially conduct a probe to the allegations surrounding him.\n\nThe scandal took a dramatic turn on December 15, when Roh Sung-il, who collaborated on that paper, stated to media outlets that nine of those eleven lines had been faked; specifically, DNA tests illustrated that those nine lines shared identical DNA, implying that they had come from the same source. Roh stated that \"Professor Hwang admitted to fabrication\", and that he, Hwang, and another co–author had asked \"Science\" to withdraw the paper. Adding fuel to the fire, MBC broadcast the content of the canceled \"PD Su-cheop\" show, which substantiated Roh's claim.\n\nOn the same day, The Seattle Times reported that \"Science\" had not yet received an official request from Hwang to withdraw the paper, and it had refused to remove Schatten's name from the paper, stating, \"No single author, having declared at the time of submission his full and complete confidence in the contents of the paper, can retract his name unilaterally, after publication.\"\n\nSeveral prominent scientists, including Ian Wilmut, who cloned Dolly the sheep in 1996, and Bob Lanza, a cloning expert based in Worcester, Massachusetts, did call on Hwang to submit his paper to an outside group for independent analysis. Lanza noted, \"You can't fake the results if they're carried out by an independent group. I think this simple test could put the charges to rest.\"\n\nTwo major press conferences were held on Korean networks on December 16, one with Hwang followed by the other with his former colleague, Roh Sung-il. Hwang started his press conference by claiming that the technology to make stem cells exists, which is not an explicit statement that the stem cell lines he featured in his paper to \"Science\" were not fakes. He, however, acknowledged the falsifications of research data in the paper, attributing them to unrecoverable \"artificial mistakes.\" He said that there was a problem with the original lines caused by contamination, and if he were given ten more days he could re-create the stem cell lines. He accused Dr. Kim Sun-Jong, a former collaborator, of \"switching\" some of the stem cell lines.\n\nDespite Hwang's claim, in another press conference held only minutes later, Roh Sung-il rebutted Hwang's accusation, saying Hwang was blackmailing MizMedi and Kim Sun-jong. He maintained that at least nine of the eleven stem cell lines were fakes and that Hwang is simply untrustworthy.\n\n\"Roh Sung-il, chairman of the board at Mizmedi Hospital, told KBS television that Hwang had agreed to ask the journal Science to withdraw the paper, published in June to international acclaim. Roh was one of the co-authors of the article that detailed how individual stem cell colonies were created for 11 patients through cloning. Roh also told MBC television that Hwang had pressured a former scientist at his lab to fake data to make it look like there were 11 stem cell colonies. In a separate report, a former researcher told MBC that Hwang ordered him to fabricate photos to make it appear there were 11 separate colonies from only three. [...] University of Pittsburgh researcher Gerald Schatten has already asked that Science remove him as the senior author of the report, citing questions about the paper's accuracy. Seoul National University announced this week it would conduct an internal probe into Hwang's research.\"\n\nSome scientists have started questioning Hwang's earlier work published in \"Science\" in February 2004 in which he claimed to have cloned embryonic stem cells. Maria Biotech head Park Se-pill said, \"Up until now, I have believed Hwang did derive cloned embryonic stem cells although he admitted to misconduct in his follow-up paper on patient-specific stem cells...Now, I am not sure whether the cloned stem cell really existed.\"\n\nOn July 26, 2006, Hwang said in testimony that he spent part of 500 million won in private donations in attempts to clone extinct Russian mammoths and Korean tigers.\n\nAn internal panel was set up in Seoul National University to investigate the allegation, and the probe was started on December 17, 2005. The panel sealed off Hwang's laboratory and conducted a thorough investigation, collecting testimonies from Hwang, Roh and other people that were involved with the scandal. On December 23, the panel announced its initial finding that Hwang had intentionally fabricated stem cell research results creating nine fake cell lines out of eleven, and added that the validity of two remaining cell lines is yet to be confirmed. The panel stated that Hwang's misconduct is \"a grave act damaging the foundation of science.\" Hwang's claim of having used only 185 eggs to create stem cell lines was also denied by the panel, which indicated that more eggs may have been used in the research process.\n\nThe panel announced additional findings on December 29, and confirmed that there are no patient-matched embryonic stem cells in existence and that Hwang's team doesn't have the scientific data to prove any of the stem cells have ever been made.\n\nIn its final report published on January 10, 2006, the panel reaffirmed its previous findings while announcing additional discoveries. The panel found out that, contrary to Hwang's claim of having used 185 eggs for his team's 2005 paper, at least 273 eggs were shown to have been used according to research records kept in Hwang's lab. In addition, the panel discovered that Hwang's team was supplied with 2,061 eggs in the period of November 28, 2002 to December 8, 2005. Hwang's claim of not having known about the donation of eggs by his own female researchers was also denied by the panel; in fact, it was discovered that Hwang himself had distributed egg donation consent forms to his researchers and personally escorted one to the MizMedi Hospital to perform the egg extraction procedure.\n\nThe panel stated that Hwang's 2004 Science paper was also fabricated and decided the stem cell discussed in the paper may have been generated by a case of parthenogenetic process (which is itself a significant development, as mammals rarely reproduce by parthenogenesis; in addition, this would make Hwang's lab the first ever to successfully generate human stem cells via parthenogenesis, predating other research facilities' successes). Although Hwang's team didn't rule out the possibility of parthenogenetic process in the paper, the panel said, his team didn't make any conscientious effort to probe the possibility through the tests available.\n\nChung Myunghee, the head of the panel, said at a news conference that the panel is not in a position to investigate Hwang's claim of his stem cells having been switched with MizMedi's, but added that such a claim is incomprehensible when there is no data to prove any of the stem cells were ever made to begin with.\n\nThe panel, in conclusion, stated that Hwang's team intentionally fabricated the data in both the 2004 and the 2005 papers and that it is \"an act of deception targeted to both scientific community and general public.\" However, the panel confirmed that Hwang's team actually succeeded in cloning a dog they named Snuppy. (See also \"Nature\" 439:122-123)\n\nOn December 23, 2005 Hwang apologized for \"creating a shock and a disappointment\" and announced that he was resigning his position as professor at the university. However, Hwang maintained that patient-matched stem cell technology remains in South Korea, and his countrymen shall see it.\n\nSeoul National University said Hwang's resignation request will not be accepted, citing a university regulation that dictates an employee under investigation may not resign from a post. This regulation is effected to prevent premature resignations by investigated employees, which would allow them to avoid full retributions according to the findings of the investigation (and perhaps avoid involuntary termination), while reaping the benefits of the more honorable and lucrative voluntary resignation.\n\nOn February 9, 2006, the university suspended Hwang's position as the university's professor, together with six other faculty members who participated in Hwang's team. Subsequently, Hwang was dismissed from the university on March 20, 2006.\n\nOn May 12, 2006, Hwang was indicted on charges of fraud, embezzlement and breach of the country's bioethics law, without physical detention. Prosecutors also brought fraud charges against the three stem cell researchers. He embezzled 2.8 billion won ($3 million) out of some 40 billion won in research funds for personal purposes and the illegal purchase of ova used in his experiments.\n\nThe prosecution also said Hwang's three associates involved in his stem cell research, Yoon Hyun-soo, Lee Byeong-chun and Kang Sung-keun, also misappropriated tens of millions of won in research money. Investigators have been tracking 24.6 billion won to find out how the research money was spent. It was part of Hwang's 36.9 billion won research funds raised through state support and private donations. Investigators said Hwang used bank accounts held by relatives and subordinates in 2002 and 2003 to receive about 475 million won from private organizations. He allegedly laundered the money by withdrawing it all in cash, breaking it up into smaller amounts and putting it back in various bank accounts. Hwang also withdrew 140 million won in August 2001 to buy gifts for his sponsors, including politicians and other prominent social figures, before Chusok holidays, according to prosecutors. He also allegedly misappropriated around 26 million won in research funds in September 2004 to buy a car for his wife. Hwang is suspected of embezzling 600 million won, provided by a private foundation, on multiple occasions from 2001 to 2005 for personal use. Prosecutors are also accusing him of illegally paying some 38 million won to 25 women who provided ova for his research through Hanna Women's Clinic in the first eight months of 2005. They also said Hwang gave several dozen politicians about 55 million won in political funds on numerous occasions from 2001 to 2005. He allegedly provided 14 million won to executives of large companies that provided financial support for his research. The prosecution added Hwang wired about 200 million won to a Korean American, identified only as Kang, in September 2005 and received the equivalent amount in U.S. currency from him when the scientist visited the United States two months later. Also in 2005, Hwang received one billion won each in research funds from SK Group and the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation based on his fabricated stem cell research results. Meanwhile, investigators said Lee Byeong-chun and Kang Sung-keun, both professors of veterinary science at Seoul National University, embezzled about 300 million won and 100 million won each in state funds by inflating research-related expenses. Yoon Hyun-soo, a biology professor at Hanyang University, also embezzled 58 million won from the research fund managed by MizMedi Hospital.\n\nOn August 2, 2007, after much independent investigation, it was revealed that Hwang's team succeeded in extracting cells from eggs that had undergone parthenogenesis. Hwang claimed he and his team had extracted stem cells from cloned human embryos. However, further examination of the cells' chromosomes shows the same indicators of parthenogenesis in those extracted stem cells as are found in the mice created by Tokyo scientists in 2004. Although Hwang deceived the world about being the first to create artificially cloned human embryos, he did contribute a major breakthrough to the field of stem cell research. The process may offer a way for creating stem cells that are genetically matched to a particular woman for the treatment of degenerative diseases.\n\nThe news of the breakthrough came just a month after an announcement from the International Stem Cell Corporation (ISC), a California-based stem cell research company, that they had successfully created the first human embryos through parthenogenesis. Although the actual results of Hwang's work were just published, those embryos were created by him and his team before February 2004, when the fabricated cloning results were announced, which would make them the first to successfully perform the process. Jeffrey Janus, president and director of research for ISC, agrees that \"Dr. Hwang's cells have characteristics found in parthenogenetic cells\" but remains cautious, saying \"it needs more study.\"\n\nAfter having acquired a celebrity status in South Korea, Hwang actively sought to establish every possible tie to political and economic institutions in the country. Hwang especially tried to win favor from the Roh Moo-hyun government, which in turn was suffering from a lack of popular support and wanted to demonstrate its competency by creating and promoting an exemplary policy success.\n\nHwang approached Park Ki-young, a former biology professor, then appointed as the Information, Science and Technology Advisor for the President, and put her as one of the co-authors in his 2004 \"Science\" paper. Ties with Park yielded a favorable environment for Hwang in the government, as a non-official group consisting of high-ranking government officials was created to support Hwang's research that includes not only Hwang and Park, but also Kim Byung-joon, Chief National Policy Secretary, and Jin Dae-je, Information and Communications Minister. The group was dubbed as \"\"Hwang-kum-pak-chui\"\", a loose acronym made from each member's family names, which means \"golden bat\" in Korean.\n\nAfter Hwang's paper was published in \"Science\" in 2005, support for Hwang came in full swing. In June 2005, the Ministry of Science and Technology selected Hwang as the first recipient of the title Supreme Scientist, an honor worth US$15 million. Hwang, having already claimed the title of POSCO Chair Professor worth US$1.5 million, secured more than US$27 million worth of support in that year.\n\nPresident Roh had been acquainted with Hwang since 2003, and made a number of comments intended to protect Hwang from potential bioethical issues. On June 18, 2004, Roh awarded Hwang a medal and said, \"it is not possible nor desirable to prohibit research, just because there are concerns that it may lead to a direction that is deemed unethical.\" In another instance at the opening of World Stem Cell Hub on October 19, 2005, Roh remarked, \"politicians have a responsibility to manage bioethical controversies not to get in the way of this outstanding research and progress.\"\n\nOn December 5, 2005, after \"PD Su-cheop\" stirred a national controversy, Cheong Wa Dae reaffirmed its unflinching support for Hwang and his research team. Roh said, \"We'll continue to support Professor Hwang. We hope he will return to his research lab soon for the sake of people with physical difficulties and the public\", according to presidential spokesman Kim Man-soo.\n\nWhile implying the controversies over MBC-TV's forceful methods used to gather information from Hwang's former junior staff members, Roh said, \"The disputes will be resolved gradually and naturally through following scientific research and study. We hope the ongoing disputes over Hwang's achievement will be settled without further trouble.\"\n\nIt was alleged that advisor Park Ki-young deliberately avoided to report Roh about details of Hwang's allegation for misconduct, while emphasizing a breach of journalist ethics by MBC. Park, after weeks of silence for her role in the controversy, announced her intent to resign from the advisor post on January 10, 2006.\n\nOn January 11, 2006, the national post office stopped selling post stamps commemorating Hwang's research. The title of Supreme Scientist awarded to Hwang was revoked on March 21, 2006, after Hwang was dismissed from Seoul National University the day before.\n\nOn December 6, 2005 a group of 43 lawmakers from the ruling and opposition parties inaugurated a body to support Hwang Woo-suk. Members of the group, dubbed the \"lawmakers' group supporting Professor Hwang Woo-suk\", pledged to help Hwang continue his experiments in pursuit of a scientific breakthrough.\n\n\"There are many lawmakers who, regardless of party affiliation, want to support Hwang. We will join forces to help Hwang devote himself to his studies\", Rep. Kwon Sun-taik of the ruling Uri Party said in a news conference at the National Assembly, who was also the leader of the group.\n\nHe said the group will seek to establish bioethics guidelines and come up with supporting measures for biotechnology researchers in the country. Among those who have joined the group were Reps. Kim Hyuk-kyu, Kim Young-choon and Kim Sung-gon of the ruling party, Kim Hyong-o of the main opposition Grand National Party (GNP) and Kim Hak-won, chairman of the United Liberal Democrats.\n\nSome female lawmakers participated in a civic group for voluntary egg donations for therapeutic research, which opened in November 2005 following the egg procurement scandal.\n\nReps. Song Young-sun and Chin Soo-hee of the GNP said they would provide their eggs to Hwang's research team. Meanwhile, the ruling and opposition parties called on the Korean Broadcasting Commission to thoroughly investigate the staffers of MBCs PD Notebook, which broadcast a documentary program critical of Hwang with coercive tactics in interviews, and reprimand them.\n\nAfter most of Hwang's claims were confirmed fake on January 10, 2006, some lawmakers revealed that Hwang made several campaign donations to them and other lawmakers.\n\nThe investigative journalism show MBC \"PD Notebook\" (Korean: PD수첩) returned on air on January 3, 2006, and summarized the course of Hwang's scandal to date. The show had been cancelled under pressure after it aired its show on November 22 that accused Hwang of oddities in his research. The last show in 2005, aired on November 29, covered other topics. It remained off the air for five weeks. The second show in 2006, on January 10, dealt further with the Hwang affair, focusing on several instances of Hwang's media spinning tactics. It also covered the unwillingness on the part of a significant part of the public in South Korea to believe that someone who had almost achieved a status of a national hero committed such a shame.\n\nThe same day many South Korean citizens rallied outside Hwang's laboratory; as more than 1,000 women pledged to donate their eggs for the scientist's research. [ ... ] Hwang has been in seclusion since apologizing in November 2005, for ethical lapses in human egg procurement for his research. The symbolic event was as a gesture from Hwang's supporters that says they intend to donate their eggs with 1,000 of their members after they took egg-donation pledges online via their website. \"Dr. Hwang will not be able to return to the lab, at least, until at the end of this week because he is extremely exhausted, mentally and physically\", a key team member, Ahn Cu Rie, wrote in an e-mail to Reuters. [ ... ] At Hwang's lab at Seoul National University, women left bouquets of the national flower, a hibiscus called the Rose of Sharon, for the scientist along with notes of encouragement.\n\nThe stem cell research center that Hwang led before resigning said it hoped he would return, even though his lapses could hurt its efforts to work with other research institutions.\n\n\"So far more than 700 South Korean women have pledged to donate their eggs and the number is steadily rising\", said Lee Sun-min, an official at a private foundation launched last week to promote egg donations. [ ... ] Thousands of patients have applied to participate in the research, hoping the technology could help treat damaged spinal cords or diseases such as Parkinson's. On Tuesday, an official at the lab said it was hoped that Hwang would return.\n\n\"We're waiting for Hwang to assume the leadership after some rest\", Seong Myong-hoon told a news conference. But Seong said the controversy could hurt the lab. That conclusion was reached after one of Hwang's close research partners, Ahn Cu-rie, returned Tuesday after a 10-day trip to meet with scientists in the United States and Japan, Seong said.\n\n\"The reaction of foreign scientists was that they understand what Dr. Hwang disclosed, but they cannot accept that without criticism\", Seong said. \"We can never be optimistic about cooperation with foreign institutions.\"\n\nSeong added: \"Researchers of our country were newly awakened to the fact that we have to take every precaution to ensure we don't fall behind international ethics (guidelines) while researching.\"\n\n\"The only hope for us is Dr. Hwang. Don't trample on our one shred of hope\", a woman whose son suffers from a severe kidney ailment told South Korean broadcaster YTN at the university. The woman also pledged to sell her eggs to Hwang.\n\nA website backed by Hwang's supporters began taking egg-donation pledges online since late November 2005 after Hwang resigned all his official posts at World Stem Cell Hub, relaying them to a clinic linked to Hwang's research team. The number of pledges had reached 725 by early December 2005.\n\nBanners like \"Please come back, Doctor Hwang. I'm already dying to see you, Professor Hwang\", were put up on the homepage.\n\nThe site also carried a photo of Hwang and his cloned dog, Snuppy, trimmed with images of the rose of sharon, South Korea's national flower, in an apparent appeal for patriotism. The national anthem played as background music.\n\nThose who applied to donate ova included those with incurable illnesses or their family members, who hope that Hwang's research will eventually lead to cures, as well as just ordinary young, healthy women.\n\n\n"}

These telescopes formed an astronomical interferometer where all the signals are combined in a purpose-built computer (a correlator) to produce high-resolution astronomical images. The telescopes ceased operation in April 2015 and were relocated to the Owens Valley Radio Observatory for storage.\n\nThe Atacama Large Millimeter Array in Chile has succeeded CARMA as the most powerful millimeter wave interferometer in the world.\n\nAccording to the CARMA observatory catalog, the median height of all telescope pads was at an elevation of . The observatory was located in the Inyo Mountains to the east of the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, at a site called Cedar Flat, accessed through Westgard Pass. The high elevation site was chosen to minimize millimeter wave absorption and phase decoherence by atmospheric water vapor.\n\nThis array was unique for being a heterogeneous collection of radio telescopes of varying sizes and design. There were three types of telescopes, all Cassegrain reflector antennas with parabolic primary mirrors and hyperbolic secondary mirrors:\n\n\n, the six telescopes from the OVRO array and the nine telescopes from the BIMA array were working together to gather scientific data. Pioneering work on compensating for the image distortion resulting from turbulent water vapor distributions in the troposphere started in the fall of 2008.\n\nThe most extended configurations of the array, up to , were required for viewing the finest details in astronomical images. Over these distances the variation in the time of arrival of signals at the different telescopes as they pass through different amounts of water vapor severely limits the quality of images.\n\nBy siting an SZA antenna near each of the CARMA antennas and observing a compact astronomical radio source near the source under study, the properties of the atmosphere could be measured on time scales as short as a couple of seconds. This information could be used in the data reduction process to remove a significant fraction of the degradation caused by the atmospheric scintillation.\n\nObservations using the SZA (operating at 30 GHz) to make the atmospheric measurements started in November 2008. The SZA has also participated directly in the science operations of CARMA during experiments where all three types of telescopes were attached to the same correlator.\n\nObservations were primarily in the 3 mm range (80–115 GHz) and the 1 mm range (210–270 GHz). These frequencies are useful for detecting many molecular gases, including the second most abundant molecule in the universe, carbon monoxide (CO).\n\nObserving CO is an indirect indicator of the presence of molecular hydrogen gas (the most abundant molecule in the universe) which is difficult to detect directly. Cold dust is also detectable in this wavelength range and can be used to study planet-forming disks around stars, for example. In 2009, the OVRO 10.4 m antennas were instrumented with 27–35 GHz receivers and made observations in the centimeter band in concert with the SZA antennas.\n\nCARMA was a consortium composed of three primary groups.\n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology, Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA), University of Chicago\n\n\n\n"}

It lies in the town of Franconia in Grafton County, and appears on the New England Fifty Finest list of the most topographically prominent peaks in New England. The mountain's upper reaches are located in the alpine zone, an area where only dwarf vegetation exists due to the harsh climate.\n\nMount Lafayette is the highest point in the Franconia Range, a line of peaks along the east side of Franconia Notch. It is the sixth highest peak in New Hampshire and the highest outside of the Presidential Range. It is the second most prominent peak in the state.\n\nOn the western side, its lower slopes lie inside Franconia Notch State Park. The remainder of the mountain lies within the White Mountain National Forest. The summit marks the western border of the Pemigewasset Wilderness Area within the WMNF.\n\nA variety of trails lead up over 3,000 vertical feet (900 m) to its exposed summit. The Greenleaf Trail begins at the parking lot for the Cannon Mountain tramway and ascends to the Appalachian Mountain Club's Greenleaf Hut, then continues to the summit. The Bridle Path trail follows a western spur ridge of Lafayette from Lafayette Place Campground on Interstate 93 past Greenleaf Hut and joins the Greenleaf Trail, reaching the summit after the hut. The peak is at the junction of the Garfield Ridge Trail, which follows the ridge northeast to Mount Garfield, and the Franconia Ridge Trail, which leads south to Mounts Lincoln, Liberty, and Flume. Both the Garfield Ridge Trail and the Franconia Ridge Trail form part of the Appalachian Trail. \nA very popular hike is to make a loop combining the three most notable summits of the Franconia Range. The loop starts with the Old Bridle Path to the AMC Greenleaf Hut. From there, one takes the Greenleaf Trail to the summit of Mt. Lafayette. Turning south along the Franconia Ridge Trail, one passes over Mount Lincoln and Little Haystack, then descends via the Falling Waters Trail, which connects back with the beginning of the Old Bridle Path. This loop is long, with a cumulative elevation gain of about .\nThe mountain is named to honor General Lafayette, a French military hero who fought with and significantly aided the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.

In the start round, the Capitol and Century division winners played in the Eastern Conference Game, while the Coastal and Central division winners were in the Western Conference game. The winners of the two conference games advanced to the NFL Championship Game to compete for the NFL league title and the right to face the American Football League champion in the Super Bowl. The losers of the conference championship games played in the Playoff Bowl, a third place game held at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida.\n\nPrior to , the playoff sites rotated and were known prior to the start of the season. In 1968, the hosts were the Century and Coastal division winners for the conference championships (first round), and the Eastern Conference for the championship game. This effectively gave home field advantage to the Century Division winner, the Cleveland Browns (10–4). The 1967 and 1969 playoff hosts were Capitol, Central, and Western, respectively.\n\nThe rotation system forced the 12-2 Cowboys, champions of the Capitol Division, to play at the 10-4 Browns in the Eastern Conference playoff. It had no effect in the Western Conference, where the 13-1 Colts hosted the 8-6 Vikings. \n\nDespite the game's high score, this was actually a defensive struggle as both teams took advantage of each other's turnovers throughout the game. However, Cleveland emerged triumphant, overcoming a 10–3 first half deficit with 21 unanswered points.\n\nEarly in the first quarter, Browns defensive back Mike Howell intercepted a pass from Don Meredith and returned it 20 yards to set up Don Cockroft's 38-yard field goal. Dallas took the lead later on, when linebacker Chuck Howley forced a fumble while sacking Browns quarterback Bill Nelsen and returned it 44 yards for a touchdown.\n\nIn the second quarter, Dallas increased their lead to 10–3 when an interception by Cowboys linebacker Dave Edwards led to Mike Clark's 16-yard field goal. However, the Browns tied the game with a last minute drive at the end of the half, moving the ball 85 yards in 4 plays and scoring on Nelsen's 45-yard touchdown pass to running back Leroy Kelly.\n\nThe Browns broke the game open on the first play of the second half when linebacker Dale Lindsey intercepted Meredith's sideline pass intended for Bob Hayes and raced 27 yards to the end zone, giving Cleveland a 17–10 lead. Then on the third play after the ensuing kickoff, Meredith threw a pass that bounced out of the grasp of Lance Rentzel and was picked off by defensive back Ben Davis, who returned the ball 3 yards to the Cowboys' 35. On the next play, Kelly took a pitch to the right and ran 35 yards for a touchdown, increasing Cleveland's lead to 24–10. \n\nDallas coach Tom Landry eventually replaced Meredith with Craig Morton, who managed to lead the team to a 47-yard field goal by Clark with 3:24 left in the 3rd quarter. But 24–13 was as close as the score would get. On Cleveland's next drive, Nelsen's play action pass to Paul Warfield picked up 39 yards and a first down on the Dallas 11-yard line. Three plays later, Ernie Green's 2-yard touchdown run gave them an insurmountable 31–13 4th quarter lead. All that remained in the game would be Morton's meaningless 2-yard touchdown pass to fullback Walt Garrison with a minute left in regulation. The final 31 seconds would never be reached because the game had to be called off, as Cleveland fans spilled out on the field for an early victory celebration. \n\nNelsen completed 13 of 25 passes for 203 yards and a touchdown, with 1 interception. Kelly rushed for 87 yards, caught 2 passes for 46 yards, and scored 2 touchdowns.\n\nBaltimore shut out the Vikings for the first three quarters and built a 21–0 lead to earn a trip to the NFL championship game.\n\nThe Colts got their first scoring chance early in the first quarter when defensive back Jerry Logan intercepted a pass from Vikings QB Joe Kapp and returned it 24 yards to the Minnesota 22. The Vikings defense managed to prevent a score when Earsell Mackbee recovered a fumble from running back Tom Matte, but after a punt, Colts quarterback Earl Morrall completed a 39-yard pass to Willie Richardson that gave the team a first down on the Vikings' 36-yard line. On the next play, Richardson made a leaping catch on the 3-yard line for a 33-yard gain. Minnesota managed to stuff two Colts rushing attempts, but on third down, Baltimore got on the board with Morrall's 3-yard touchdown pass to Tom Mitchell. This ended up being the only score of the half. The only other highlights would be an interception from each team, by Ed Sharockman and Bobby Boyd.\n\nColts kicker Lou Michaels missed a 33-yard field goal attempt early in the third quarter, but the Colts got the ball back with great field position at midfield after the Vikings punted. Then on the second play of the Colts' ensuing drive, Morrall threw a pass to tight end John Mackey, who broke ahead of linebacker Roy Winston, caught the ball and then raced past safeties Karl Kassulke and Paul Krause to score on a 49-yard touchdown completion, giving the Colts a 14–0 lead. Vikings returner Clint Jones gave his team a chance to get back in the game with a 35-yard kickoff return to the Colts' 42-yard line. However, on the second play of the possession, Colts lineman Bubba Smith plowed into Kapp as he was winding up to throw a pass, knocking the ball out of his hand and right into the arms of linebacker Mike Curtis, who returned the fumble 60 yards to the end zone.\n\nFaced with a 21–0 deficit in the 4th quarter, Minnesota drove 77 yards, aided by two catches by Gene Washington for 27 yards and a 33-yard pass interference penalty on Colts defensive back Lenny Lyles that gave them a first and goal on the Baltimore 1-yard line. After that, Kapp threw a 1-yard touchdown toss to tight end Bill Martin. However, a 33-yard field goal by Michaels quickly snuffed out the Vikings' hopes of a miracle comeback. All they could do with the remaining time was make the final score 24–14 when Kapp finished off a 73-yard drive with a 7-yard touchdown pass to running back Bill Brown with 4 seconds left on the clock.\n\nMorrall completed 13 of 22 passes for 280 yards and two touchdowns, with 1 interception. Richardson caught 6 passes for 148 yards, while Mackey had 3 receptions for 92 yards and a touchdown. Kapp finished the day 26 of 44 for 287 yards and two touchdowns, with two interceptions. He was also the game's leading rusher with 10 carries for 52 yards. Washington caught 5 passes for 95 yards.\n\nBaltimore held Cleveland to just 173 total yards as they avenged their only regular season loss of the year, against the Browns, with a dominant shutout win. Cleveland crossed midfield only twice, just once in each half, and kicker Don Cockroft missed three field goal attempts.\n\nThings actually started out promising for Cleveland. Browns defensive back Ben Davis wiped out a scoring chance for Baltimore on their opening drive when he intercepted a pass from Earl Morrall on the Cleveland 14-yard line. The Browns then drove to the Colts' 35-yard line, with Bill Nelsen completing passes to Paul Warfield and Milt Morin for gains of 16 and 22 yards. However, Nelsen was dropped for a 7-yard loss on first down by Fred Miller and Ordell Braase. He managed to lead the team back to the 35 by the time they got to 4th down, but Cockroft's 42-yard field goal attempt was blocked by defensive tackle Bubba Smith. The Colts then took over and drove to a 3–0 lead on a 28-yard field goal by Lou Michaels.\n\nIn the second quarter, Baltimore completely took over the game. Colts running back Tom Matte scored on a 1-yard touchdown run, giving the Colts a 10–0 lead. Later on, the Colts seemed to blow a scoring chance when tight end John Mackey lost a fumble that was recovered by Erich Barnes and returned 9 yards to the Browns' 23. But on the next play, linebacker Mike Curtis intercepted a pass from Nelsen on the 33, leading to Matte's 12-yard touchdown run that gave Baltimore a 17–0 lead going into halftime.\n\nAfter halftime, Cleveland forced a punt and got the ball on their own 40, where they proceeded to drive to the Colts' 38. But once again their drive stalled and Cockroft missed a 50-yard field goal attempt. He got another chance as a result of a penalty on the play, but missed again from 45 yards on his next attempt. After an exchange of punts, Baltimore got the ball on the Cleveland 48 and drove to a 24–0 lead on Matte's third touchdown of the day. Meanwhile, Nelsen was benched and replaced by Frank Ryan, but this did nothing to improve Cleveland's misfortunes. On his first play, he fumbled the snap, and linebacker Don Shinnick recovered the ball on the Browns' 20-yard line, leading to Michaels' second field goal, giving Baltimore a 27–0 lead on the second play of the 4th quarter. Ryan completed just 2 of 6 pass attempts for the rest of the game, while Colts running back Timmy Brown scored the final points on a 4-yard touchdown run.\n\nMatte, an Ohio native and former quarterback at Ohio State, was the sole offensive star of the game, rushing for 88 yards and 3 touchdowns, while also catching 2 passes for 15 yards.\n"}

Wagner's law of increasing state activity is named after him.\n\nBorn in Erlangen as the son of a university professor, the physiologist Rudolf Wagner, Adolph studied economics at the University of Göttingen, receiving a doctorate in 1857 under supervision of . Wagner’s academic career took him first to the Merchants’ Superior School, Vienna (1858–1863), then – after failing to secure a chair at the University of Vienna because of disagreements over fiscal policy with Lorenz von Stein – to the Hamburg Higher Merchants’ School (1863–1865), both institutions comparable to business schools today. In 1865, he took the chair of Ethnography, Geography, and Statistics (in reality an economics professorship) at the University of Dorpat in Livonia which is located in the present day Estonia, but was then part of the Russian Empire.\n\nIn Dorpat (Tartu), Wagner \"became a follower of Bismarck’s policy for unifying Germany under Prussian guidance. Thus when German unification became realistic, Wagner wanted to go back to Germany proper.\n\nBeginning Fall Term 1868/69, Wagner therefore took over the Chair of the Cameralistic subjects (roughly, state management) at the Badensian University of Freiburg im Breisgau, and very soon afterwards, in 1870, the Chair of \"Staatswissenschaften\" at the University of Berlin, by that time not only the premier university in Germany but probably in the world. It was in Berlin, that Wagner began his tenure as one of the most intellectually and politically influential economists of his time.\n\nA former student of his, Werner Sombart, was his successor at the economics chair of the University of Berlin.\n\nWagner was an early member of the conservative Christian Social Party, founded in 1878 by Adolf Stoecker as the \"Christlichsoziale Arbeiterpartei\" (Christian Social Workers' Party).\nWagner died in Berlin in 1917.\n\nWagner is the main protagonist of a specific school of economics and social policy, called \"State Socialism\" (\"\"Staatssozialismus\"\"), which is a specific form of \"Kathedersozialismus\".\n(Albert Schäffle (1831–1903), Lujo Brentano (1844–1931), Gustav von Schmoller (1838–1917) and Karl Rodbertus(-Jagetzow) (1805–1875) were important protagonists of that thought as well.) He was a member of the Historical school of economics, as his general review essay on Marshall's \"Principles of Economics\" so clearly demonstrates. However, he did fundamentally differentiate himself from what he called the 'younger' and more 'extreme' members of the German historical school such as Gustav von Schmoller who, according to Wagner, tended to dismiss too hastily what the latter terms the more deductive work of English writers (in short, those in the tradition of classical economics, including the famous contemporary Cambridge University Professor Alfred Marshall whose book he was reviewing).\n\nWagner had a very combative and harsh personality.\nHe did not take insults lightly and never phrased things diplomatically. He had difficulties with Schmoller and was an enemy of Lujo Brentano – and these two were about his closest colleagues.\n\nBy all contemporary accounts, it is probably fair to say that Wagner was vain, easily hurt and extremely choleric.\n\nIn the 1890s, Wagner would so enrage an industrial-conservative member of the \"Reichstag\", likewise with a defense of the \"Kathedersozialist\" influence within the University, that the deputy challenged him to a duel. (Wagner did not categorically refuse, but it was never fought.)\n\nAn even more famous case was Wagner’s altercation with Eugen Dühring (against whom Friedrich Engels' \"Anti-Dühring\" is directed), and which in the very end resulted in Dühring's remotion and dismissal from the University of Berlin.\n\nTogether with Gustav von Schmoller, Wagner belongs to the most important economists of the Bismarck period. He was a member of the \"Verein für Socialpolitik\" (Society for Social Policy).\n\nWagner formulated the Law of Increasing State Spending, also known as \"Wagner's Law.\"\n\nHis works set the stage for the development of the monetary and credit systems in Germany and substantially influenced the central bank policy and financial practice before World War I.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Among ancient Romans in Spain, sexual interaction between men was viewed as commonplace and marriages between men occurred during the early Roman Empire, but a law against same-sex marriages was promulgated by Christian emperors Constantius II and Constans, and Roman moral norms underwent significant changes leading up to the 4th century. The influence of Christianity eventually characterised sexuality as an act whose only goal was procreation, with homosexuality being viewed as one of many sexual activities that were sinful and against God's will. Laws against sodomy were later established during the legislative period. Laws against sodomy were first repealed from the Spanish Code in 1822. Laws changed again along with societal attitudes towards homosexuality during the Spanish Civil War and Francisco Franco's regime.\n\nThroughout the late-20th century, the rights of the LGBT community received more awareness and same-sex sexual activity became legal once again in 1979 with an equal age of consent to heterosexual intercourse. Today, Spain has been recognised for providing one of the highest degrees of liberty in the world to its LGBT citizens. After recognising unregistered cohabitation between same-sex couples countrywide and registered partnerships in certain cities and communities since 1994 and 1997, Spain legalised both same-sex marriage and adoption rights for same-sex couples in 2005. Transgender individuals are allowed to change their legal gender without the need of sex reassignment surgery or sterilisation. Discrimination in employment regarding sexual orientation has been banned nationwide since 1995. LGBT people are allowed to openly serve in the military and MSMs have been allowed to donate blood since 2005.\n\nSpain has been recognised as one of the most culturally liberal and LGBT-friendly countries in the world and LGBT culture has had a significant role in Spanish literature, music, cinema and other forms of entertainment as well as social issues and politics. Public opinion on homosexuality is noted by pollsters as being overwhelmingly positive, with a study conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2013 indicating that more than 88 percent of Spanish citizens accepted homosexuality, making it the most LGBT-friendly of the 39 countries polled. LGBT visibility has also increased in several layers of society such as the Guardia Civil, army, judicial, and clergy. However, in other areas such as sports, the LGBT community remains marginalised. Spanish film directors such as Pedro Almodóvar have increased awareness regarding LGBT tolerance in Spain among international audiences. In 2007, Madrid hosted the annual Europride celebration and hosted WorldPride in 2017. The cities of Madrid and Barcelona also have a reputation as two of the most LGBT-friendly cities in the world. Gran Canaria is also known worldwide as an LGBT tourist destination.\n\nThe Romans brought, as with other aspects of their culture, their sexual morality to Spain. Romans were open-minded about their relationships, and sexuality among men was commonplace. Among the Romans, bisexuality seems to have been perceived as the ideal. Edward Gibbon mentions, of the first fifteen emperors, \"Claudius was the only one whose taste in love was entirely correct\" – the implication being that he was the only one not to take men or boys as lovers. Gibbon based this on Suetonius' factual statement that \"He had a great passion for women, but had no interest in men.\" Suetonius and the other ancient authors actually used this against Claudius. They accused him of being dominated by these same women and wives, of being uxorious, and of being a womaniser.\n\nMarriages between men occurred during the early Roman Empire. These marriages were condemned by law in the Theodosian Code of Christian emperors Constantius and Constans on 16 December 342. Martial, a first-century poet, born and educated in Bílbilis (now Calatayud in Aragon, Spain), but spent most of his life in Rome, attests to same-sex marriages between men during the early Roman Empire. He also characterised Roman life in epigrams and poems. In a fictitious first person, he talks about anal and vaginal penetration, and about receiving fellatio from both men and women. He also attests to adult men who played passive roles with other men. He describes, for example, the case of an older man who played the passive role and let a younger slave occupy the active role.\n\nThe first recorded marriage between two men occurred during the reign of Emperor Nero, who is reported to have married two other men on different occasions. Roman Emperor Elagabalus is also reported to have done the same. Emperors who were universally praised and lauded by the Romans such as Hadrian and Trajan openly had male lovers, although it is not recorded whether or not they ever married their lovers. Hadrian's lover, Antinuous, received deification upon his death and numerous statues exist of him today, more than any other non-imperial person.\n\nAmong the conservative upper Senatorial classes, status was more important than the person in any sexual relationship. Thus, Roman citizens could penetrate non-citizen males, plebeian (or low class) males, male slaves, boys, eunuchs and male prostitutes just as easily as young female slaves, concubines and female prostitutes. However, no upper class citizen would allow himself to be penetrated by another man, regardless of age or status. He would have to play the active role in any sexual relationship with a man. There was a strict distinction between an active homosexual (who would have sex with men and women) and a passive homosexual (who was regarded as servile and effeminate). This morality was in fact used against Julius Caesar, whose allegedly passive sexual interactions with the King of Bithynia, Nicomedes, were commented everywhere in Rome. However, many people in the upper classes ignored such negative ideas about playing a passive role, as is proved by the actions of the Roman emperors Nero and Elagabalus.\n\nIn contrast to the Greeks, evidence for homosexual relationships between men of the same age exists for the Romans. These sources are diverse and include such things as the Roman novel \"Satyricon\", graffiti and paintings found at Pompeii as well as inscriptions left on tombs and papyri found in Egypt. Generally speaking, however, a kind of pederasty (not unlike the one that can be found among the Greeks) was dominant in Rome. It is important to note, however, that even among straight relationships, men tended to marry women much younger than themselves, usually in their early teens.\n\nLesbianism was also known, in two forms. Feminine women would have sex with adolescent girls: a kind of female pederasty, and masculine women followed male pursuits, including fighting, hunting and relationships with other women.\n\nAnother example is Hadrian, one of the Roman emperors born in Hispania, specifically in Italica (Santiponce today). He was emperor from 117 to 138. He had a famous young lover, Antinous, whom he deified and in whose honour he built the city of Antinoöpolis in Egypt after his death in the Nile.\n\nThe first law against same-sex marriage was promulgated by the Christian emperors Constantius II and Constans. Nevertheless, the Christian emperors continued to collect taxes on male prostitutes until the reign of Anastasius (491–581). In the year 390, Christian emperors Valentinian II, Theodosius I and Arcadius declared homosexual sex to be illegal and those who were guilty of it were condemned to be burned alive in front of the public. Christian Emperor Justinian I (527–565) made homosexuals a scapegoat for problems such as \"famines, earthquakes, and pestilences.\"\n\nAs a result of this, Roman morality changed by the 4th century. For example, Ammianus Marcellinus harshly condemned the sexual behaviour of the Taifali, a tribe located between the Carpathian Mountains and the Black Sea which practiced the Greek-style pederasty. In 342, emperors Constans and Constantius II introduced a law to punish passive homosexuality (possibly by castration), to which later in 390 Theodosius I would add death by fire to all passive homosexuals that worked in brothels. In 438, this law was expanded to include all passive homosexuals, in 533 Justinian punished any homosexual act with castration and death by fire, and in 559 this law became even more strict.\n\nThree reasons have been given for this change of attitude. Procopius, historian at Justinian's court, considered that behind the laws were political motivations, as they allowed Justinian to destroy his enemies and confiscate their properties, and were hardly efficient stopping homosexuality between ordinary citizens. The second reason, and perhaps the more important one, was the rising influence of Christianity in the Roman society, including the Christian paradigm about sex serving solely for reproduction purposes. Colin Spencer, in his book \"Homosexuality: A History\", suggests the possibility that a certain sense of self-preservation in the Roman society after suffering some epidemic such as the Black fever increased the reproductive pressure in individuals. This phenomenon would be combined with the rising influence of Stoicism in the Empire.\n\nUntil the year 313, there was no common doctrine about homosexuality in Christianity, but it is the mistaken belief that Paul had already condemned it as \"contra natura\", though he had no exegetical reason for doing so:\n\nEventually, the Church Fathers created a literary \"corpus\" in which homosexuality and sex were condemned most energetically, fighting against a common practice in that epoch's society. On the other hand, homosexuality was identified with heresy, not only because of the pagan traditions, but also due to the rites of some gnostic sects or Manichaeism, which, according to Augustine of Hippo, practised homosexual rites.\n\nThe Germanic peoples had little tolerance for both passive homosexuality and women, whom they considered on the same level as \"imbeciles\" and slaves, and glorified the warrior camaraderie between men. However, there are reports in Scandinavian countries of feminine and transvestite pastors, and the Nordic gods, the Æsir, including Thor and Odin, obtained arcane recognition drinking semen.\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages, attitudes toward homosexuality remained constant. There are known cases of homosexual behaviour which did not receive punishment, even if they were not accepted. For example, King Clovis I on his baptism day confessed to having relationships with other men; or Alcuin, an Anglo-Saxon poet whose verses and letters contain homoerotism.\n\nOne of the first legal corpus that considered male homosexuality a crime in Europe was the \"Liber Iudiciorum\" (or \"Lex Visigothorum\"). The Visigoth law included in that code (L. 3,5,6) punished sodomy with banishment and castration. Within the term \"castration\" were included all \"sexual crimes\" considered \"unnatural\", such as male homosexuality, anal sex (heterosexual and homosexual) and zoophilia. Lesbianism was considered sodomy only if it included phallic aids.\n\nIt was King Chindasuinth (642–653) who dictated that the punishment for homosexuality should be castration. Such a harsh measure was unheard of in Visigoth laws, except for the cases of Jews practising circumcision. After being castrated, the culprit was given to the care of the local bishop, who would then banish him. If he was married, the marriage was declared void, the dowry was returned to the woman and any possessions distributed among his heirs.\n\nThe Muslims who invaded and successfully conquered the peninsula in the early 8th century had a noticeably more open attitude to homosexuality than their Visigothic predecessors. In the book \"Medieval Iberia: An Encyclopedia\", Daniel Eisenberg describes homosexuality as \"a key symbolic issue throughout the Middle Ages in Iberia\", stating that in al-Andalus, homosexual pleasures were indulged in by the intellectual and political elite. There is significant evidence for this. Rulers, such as Abd-ar-Rahman III, Al-Hakam II, Hisham II, and Al Mu'tamid ibn Abbad, openly kept male harems, to the point that, to ensure an offspring, a girl had to be disguised as a boy to seduce Al-Hakem II. It was said that male prostitutes charged higher fees and had a higher class of clientele than did their female counterparts. Evidence can also be found in the repeated criticisms of Christians and especially the abundant poetry of homosexual nature. References to both pederasty and love between adult males have been found. Although homosexual practices were never officially condoned, prohibitions against them were rarely enforced, and usually there was not even a pretense of doing so. Sexual activity between men was not seen as a form of identity. Very little is known about lesbian sexual activity during this period.\n\nBy 1492, the last Islamic kingdom in the Iberian Peninsula, the Emirate of Granada, was invaded and conquered by the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon. This marked the Christian unification of the Iberian peninsula and the return of repressive Catholic morality. By the early sixteenth century, royal codes decreed death by burning for sodomy and was punished by civil authorities. It fell under the jurisdiction of the Inquisition only in the territories of Aragon, when, in 1524, Clement VII, in a papal brief, granted jurisdiction over sodomy to the Inquisition of Aragon, whether or not it was related to heresy. In Castile, cases of sodomy were not adjudicated, unless related to heresy. The tribunal of Zaragoza distinguished itself for its severity in judging these offences: between 1571 and 1579 more than 100 men accused of sodomy were prosecuted and at least 36 were executed; in total, between 1570 and 1630 there were 534 trials and 102 executions. This does not include, however, those normally executed by the secular authorities.\n\nIn 1812, Barcelona was annexed into the First French Empire and incorporated into the First French Empire as part of the department Montserrat (later \"Bouches-de-l'Èbre–Montserrat\"), where it remained until it was returned to Spain in 1814. During that time same-sex sexual intercourse was legal in Barcelona.\n\nIn 1822, the Kingdom of Spain's first penal code was adopted and same-sex sexual intercourse was legalised. In 1928, under the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, the offense of \"habitual homosexual acts\" was recriminalised in Spain.\n\nIn 1932, same-sex sexual intercourse was again legalised in Spain.\nAt the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, the gay poet Federico García Lorca was executed by Nationalist forces. Between 1936 and 1939, right-wing, Catholic forces lead by General Francisco Franco took over Spain, and Franco was dictator of the country until his death in 1975. Legal reforms in 1944 and 1963 punished same-sex sexual intercourse as \"scandalous public behavior.\" In 1954, vagrancy laws were modified to declare that homosexuals are \"a danger\", equating homosexuality with proxenetism (procuring). The text of the law declared that the measures \"are not proper punishments, but mere security measures, set with a doubly preventive end, with the purpose of collective guarantee and the aspiration of correcting those subjects fallen to the lowest levels of morality. This law is not intended to punish, but to correct and reform\". However, the way the law was applied was clearly punitive and arbitrary: police would often use the vagrancy laws against suspected political dissenters, using homosexuality (actual or perceived) as a way to go around the judicial guarantees.\n\nHowever, in other cases the harassment of gays, lesbians, and transgender people were clearly directed at their sexual mores, and homosexuals (mostly males) were sent to special prisons called \"galerías de invertidos\" (\"galleries of inverts\", i.e. homosexuals). Thousands of homosexual men and women were jailed, put in camps, or locked up in mental institutions under Franco's dictatorship, which lasted for 36 years until his death in 1975. The year Franco died, his regime began to give way to the current constitutional democracy, but in the early 1970s gay prisoners were overlooked by political activism in favour of more \"traditional\" political dissenters. Some gay activists deplored the fact that reparations were not made until 2008.\n\nHowever, in the 1960s, a clandestine gay scene began to emerge in Barcelona, and in the countercultural centers of Ibiza and Sitges (a town in the province of Barcelona, Catalonia, that remains a highly popular gay tourist destination). In the late 1960s and the 1970s, a body of gay literature emerged in Catalan. Attitudes in greater Spain began to change with the return to democracy after Franco's death through a cultural movement known as La Movida Madrileña. This movement, along with growth of the gay rights movement in the rest of Europe and the Western world, was a large factor in making Spain today one of Europe's most socially tolerant places.\n\nIn 1970, Spanish law provided for a three-year prison sentence for those accused of same-sex sexual intercourse.\n\nSame-sex sexual intercourse was again legalised in Spain in 1979, and is its status today.\n\nIn December 2001, the Spanish Parliament pledged to wipe clean the criminal records of thousands of gay and bisexual men and women who were jailed during Franco's regime. The decision meant that sentences for homosexuality and bisexuality were taken off police files. Further reparations were made in 2008.\n\nSame-sex sexual acts were lawful in Spain from 1822 to 1954, with the exception of the offence of \"unusual or outrageous indecent acts with same-sex persons\" between the years 1928 and 1932. However, some homosexuals were arrested in the days of the Second Spanish Republic under the \"Ley de Vagos y Maleantes\" (\"Vagrants and Common Delinquents Law\"). Homosexual acts were made unlawful during Francisco Franco's time in power, first by an amendment to the aforementioned law in 1954, and later by the \"Ley de Peligrosidad y Rehabilitación Social\" (\"Law on Danger and Social Rehabilitation\") in 1970. In 1979, the Adolfo Suárez Government reversed the prohibition of homosexual acts.\n\nA new penal code was introduced in Spain in 1995 which specified an age of consent of 12 for all sexual acts, but this was raised to 13 in 1999 and to 16 in 2015.\n\nIn 1994, the \"Ley de Arrendamientos Urbanos\" was passed, giving same-sex couples some recognition rights. Registries for same-sex couples were created in all of Spain's 17 autonomous communities: Catalonia (1998), Aragon (1999), Navarre (2000), Castile-La Mancha (2000), Valencia (2001), the Balearic Islands (2001), Madrid (2001), Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002), Castile and León (2002), Extremadura (2003), the Basque Country (2003), the Canary Islands (2003), Cantabria (2005), Galicia (2008), La Rioja (2010) and Murcia (2018), and in both autonomous cities; Ceuta (1998) and Melilla (2008). These registries grant unmarried couples some benefits, but the effect is mainly symbolic.\n\nSame-sex marriage and adoption were legalised by the Cortes Generales under the administration of Socialist Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero in 2005.\n\nSoon after the same-sex marriage bill became law, a member of the Guardia Civil, a military-police force, married his lifelong partner, prompting the organisation to allow same-sex partners to cohabitate in the barracks, the first police force in Europe to accommodate a same-sex partner in a military installation.\n\nAdoption by same-sex couples has been legal nationwide in Spain since July 2005. Some of Spain's autonomous communities had already legalised such adoptions beforehand, notably Navarre in 2000, the Basque Country in 2003, Aragon in 2004, Catalonia in 2005 and Cantabria in 2005. Furthermore, in Asturias, Andalusia and Extremadura, same-sex couples could jointly begin procedures to temporarily or permanently take children in care.\n\nSince 2015, married lesbians can register both their names on their child(ren)'s certificates. This, however, does not apply to cohabiting couples or couples in de facto unions, where the non-biological mother must normally go through an adoption process to be legally recognized as the child's mother.\n\nLesbian couples and single women may access in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and assisted reproductive treatments. Prior to 2019, this was mostly in the private sector, where such treatments were much more expensive (around 7,500 euros for IVF). In 2018, following reports that Spain had one of the lowest birth rates in Europe (with reportedly more deaths than births in 2017), measures extending free reproductive treatments for lesbians and single women to public hospitals were announced. The measures took effect in January 2019. Surrogacy is prohibited in Spain regardless of sexual orientation, though surrogacy arrangements undertaken overseas are usually recognized.\n\nEmployment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation has been illegal in the country since 1995. However, employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity is not banned nationwide. The first autonomous community to ban such discrimination was Navarre in 2009. The Basque Country followed suit in 2012. In 2014, Andalusia, the Canary Islands, Catalonia, and Galicia also passed bills banning discrimination. Extremadura did so in 2015. In 2016, Madrid, Murcia, and the Balearic Islands all passed laws protecting transgender people from discrimination. Valencia approved an anti-discrimination bill in April 2017, while Aragon did so in April 2018 (taking effect in January 2019).\n\nArticle 4(2) of the \"Workers' Statute\" () reads as follows:\n\nDiscrimination in the provisions of goods and services based on sexual orientation and gender identity is not banned nationwide either. The aforementioned autonomous communities all ban such discrimination within their anti-discrimination laws. Discrimination in health services and education based on sexual orientation and gender identity has been banned in Spain since 2011 and 2013, respectively.\n\nTen autonomous communities also ban discrimination based on sex characteristics, thereby protecting intersex people from discrimination. These autonomous communities are Galicia (2014), Catalonia (2014), Extremadura (2015), the Balearic Islands (2016), Madrid (2016), Murcia (2016), Valencia (2017), Navarre (2017), Andalusia (2018), and Aragon (2019).\n\nIn 2017, a comprehensive bill to forbid discrimination against LGBTI people throughout Spain in all areas, including employment, the provision of goods and services, etc. was introduced to the Cortes Generales. The legislation was stalled.\n\nHate speech on the basis of both sexual orientation and gender identity has been banned since 1995. Additionally, under the country's hate crime law, crimes motivated by the victim's sexual orientation or gender identity, amongst other categories, result in additional legal penalties.\n\nThe Secretary of State for Security reported that instances of violence against LGBT people decreased 4% in 2018. This contrasted with figures from other sources. The \"Observatorio Madrileño\" reported a 7% increase in anti-LGBT violence in Madrid, while the Observatory Against Homophobia of Catalonia () reported a 30% increase in the first few months of 2019.\n\nSince January 2019, teachers and students in Madrid are obliged to report cases of bullying, including against LGBT students.\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people may serve openly in the Spanish Armed Forces.\n\nIn November 2006, the Zapatero Government passed a law that allows transgender people to register under their preferred sex in public documents such as birth certificates, identity cards and passports without undergoing prior surgical change. The law came into effect on 17 March 2007. In July 2019, the Constitutional Court of Spain declared that prohibiting transgender minors from accessing sex changes is unconstitutional. The court ruled that transgender minors who are \"mature enough\" may register their new sex on their identity cards, and struck down the article of the 2007 legislation that limited this possibility only to those over 18. In December 2019, the first minor changed his legal gender.\n\nIntersex infants in Spain may undergo medical interventions to have their sex characteristics altered. Human rights groups consider these surgeries unnecessary and, they argue, should only be performed if the applicant consents to the operation (i.e. has reached the age of 18). Andalusia, Aragon, the Balearic Islands, Extremadura, Madrid, Murcia, Navarre, and Valencia ban the use of medical interventions on intersex children.\n\nIn April 2019, the Catalan Department of Labor, Social Affairs and Families announced that official documents in Catalonia would include the option \"non-binary\" alongside male and female.\n\nGay and bisexual men are allowed to donate blood in Spain. For anyone regardless of sexual orientation, the deferral period is six months following the last sexual encounter.\n\nThe autonomous community of Madrid approved a conversion therapy ban in July 2016. The ban went into effect on 1 January 2017, and applies to medical, psychiatric, psychological and religious groups. In August 2016, an LGBT advocacy group brought charges under the new law against a Madrid woman who offered conversion therapy. In September 2019, the woman was fined 20,000 euros.\n\nMurcia approved a conversion therapy ban in May 2016, which came into effect on 1 June 2016. Unlike the other bans, the Murcia ban only applies to health professionals.\n\nValencia banned the use of conversion therapies in April 2017. Andalusia followed suit in December 2017, with the law coming into force on 4 February 2018. In January 2019, Aragon made it an offense to promote and/or perform conversion therapy.\n\nIn April 2019, the Government of the Community of Madrid announced it was investigating the Roman Catholic Diocese of Alcalá de Henares for violating conversion therapy laws. This followed reports that a journalist named Ángel Villascusa posed as a gay man and attended a counselling service provided by the diocese. Villascusa alleged the bishop was running illegal conversion therapy sessions. The bishop was defended by the Catholic Church in Spain. Minister of Health, Consumer Affairs and Social Welfare María Luisa Carcedo called for a nationwide ban on conversion therapy. She said, \"they [the Church] are breaking the law therefore, in the first instance, these courses have to be completely abolished. I thought that, in Spain, accepting the various sexual orientations was assumed in all areas, but unfortunately we see that there are still pockets where people are told what their sexual orientation should be\".\n\nHomosexuality and bisexuality today are greatly accepted all around the country and intensely in larger and medium cities. That being said, a certain level of discrimination can still be encountered in small villages and among some parts of society.\nA Eurobarometer survey published December 2006 showed that 66 percent of Spanish people surveyed supported same-sex marriage and 43 percent supported same-sex couples' right to adopt (EU-wide averages were 44 percent and 33 percent, respectively).\n\nOn 4 March 2013, Interior Minister Jorge Fernández Díaz said that due to same-sex marriages the survival of the human species is not guaranteed. He also stated that same-sex marriages should not have the same protection under the law as opposite-sex ones, eight years after same-sex marriage was legalized.\n\nAmong the countries studied by the Pew Research Center in 2013, Spain was rated first in acceptance of homosexuality, with 88% of Spaniards believing that homosexuality should be accepted by society, compared to 11% who disagreed.\n\nIn May 2015, PlanetRomeo, an LGBT social network, published its first Gay Happiness Index (GHI). Gay men from over 120 countries were asked about how they feel about society's view on homosexuality, how do they experience the way they are treated by other people and how satisfied are they with their lives. Spain was ranked 13th with a GHI score of 68.\n\nBuzzfeed conducted a poll in December 2016 across several countries on the acceptance of transgender individuals. Spain ranked the most accepting in most categories, with 87% of those polled believing transgender people should be protected from discrimination, and only 8% believing there is something mentally or physically wrong with them. In addition, 77% believed transgender people should be allowed to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity rather than being forced to use the one of their birth-assigned gender, with over 50% strongly agreeing with this.\n\nThe 2015 Eurobarometer found that 84% of Spaniards thought that same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, 10% were against.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Spanish authors, like Jacinto Benavente, Pedro de Répide and Antonio de Hoyos y Vinent, had to choose between ignoring the subject of homosexuality or representing it negatively. The only authors publishing literature with LGBT content were foreigners: Augusto d'Halmar from Chile published \"Pasión y muerte del cura Deusto\", Alfonso Hernández Catá from Cuba published \"El ángel de Sodoma\", and Alberto Nin Frías from Uruguay published \"La novela del renacimiento y otros relatos\", \"La fuente envenenada\", \"Marcos, amador de la belleza\", \"Alexis o el significado del temperamento Urano\" and, in 1933, \"Homosexualismo creador\", the first essay representing homosexuality in a positive light.\n\nOthers, such as the authors of the Generation of '27, took refuge in poetry. The gay and bisexual poets of this literary movement were amongst the most influential in Spanish literature: Federico García Lorca, Emilio Prados, Luis Cernuda, Vicente Aleixandre and Manuel Altolaguirre. These poets were highly influenced by the great gay authors of the rest of Europe, such as Oscar Wilde, André Gide, mainly his \"Corydon\", and Marcel Proust. In 1930, Emilio García Gómez also published his \"Poemas arabigoandaluces\", which included the pederastic poets of Al-Andalus. Around the mid-1930s, there was a slight liberalisation which ended with the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. After the Civil War, with García Lorca assassinated and the majority of gay and bisexual poets in exile, gay culture retired anew to the cryptic poetry of Vicente Aleixandre, who never admitted his homosexuality publicly. Other gay poets of this period are Francisco Brines, Leopoldo María Panero, Juan Gil-Albert and Jaime Gil de Biedma and, in Córdoba, Vicente Núñez, Pablo García Baena and Juan Bernier, belonging to the \"Cántico\" group.\n\nAuthors that appear after the Spanish Transition include Juan Goytisolo, Luis Antonio de Villena, Antonio Gala, Terenci Moix, Álvaro Pombo, Vicente Molina Foix, Antonio Roig, Biel Mesquida, Leopoldo Alas, Vicente García Cervera, Carlos Sanrune, Jaume Cela, Eduardo Mendicutti, Miguel Martín, Lluis Fernández, Víctor Monserrat, Alberto Cardín, Mariano García Torres, Agustín Gómez-Arcos, Óscar Esquivias, Luisgé Martín and Iñaki Echarte.\n\nNo lesbian authors in Spain publicly acknowledged their homosexuality until the 1990s. Gloria Fuertes never wanted her sexual orientation to be public. The first lesbian author to be openly gay was Andrea Luca. Other authors who have treated love between women in their books include Ana María Moix, Ana Rosetti, Esther Tusquets, Carmen Riera, Elena Fortún, Isabel Franc and Lucía Etxebarría, whose novel \"Beatriz y los cuerpos celestes\" won the Nadal Prize in 1998.\n\nEarly representation of homosexuality in Spanish cinema was difficult due to censorship by the Franco regime. The first movie that shows any kind of homosexuality, very discreetly, was \"Diferente\", a musical from 1961, directed by Luis María Delgado. Up to 1977, if homosexuals appeared at all, it was to ridicule them as the \"funny effeminate faggot\".\n\nDuring the Spanish transition to democracy, the first films appeared where homosexuality was not portrayed in a negative way. Examples are \"La Muerte de Mikel\" from Imanol Uribe and \"Ocaña, retrat intermitent\" from Ventura Pons. In these films, authors experiment with different visions of gay men: the transvestite in \"Un hombre llamado Flor de Otoño\" (1978), the manly and attractive gay man in \"Los placeres ocultos\" (1976) from Eloy de la Iglesia, the warring \"queen\" in \"Gay Club\" (1980), etc. Homosexuality is the center of the plot, and homosexuals are shown as vulnerable, in inner turmoil and in dispute with society.\n\nBeginning in 1985, homosexuality loses primacy on the plot, in spite of still being fundamental. This trend begins with \"La ley del deseo\" (1987) from Pedro Almodóvar and continues with films like \"Tras el cristal\" (1986) from Agustí Villaronga, \"Las cosas del querer\" (1989) and \"Las cosas del querer 2\" (1995) from Jaime Chávarri. Successful films include \"Perdona bonita, pero Lucas me quería a mí\" (1997), \"Segunda piel\" (1999), \"Km. 0\" (2000), \"Plata quemada\" (2000), \"Los novios búlgaros\" (2003) and \"Cachorro\" (2004).\n\nUndoubtedly, Spain's most known LGBT person is Pedro Almodóvar. Almodóvar has often intertwined LGBT themes in his plots, and his films have turned him into one of the most renowned Spanish movie directors. Apart from Almodóvar, Ventura Pons and Eloy de la Iglesia are two film directors who have worked on more LGBT themes in their movies. In September 2004, movie director Alejandro Amenábar publicly announced his homosexuality.\n\nThere have not been as many Spanish films with a lesbian plot. The most renown may be the comedy \"A mi madre le gustan las mujeres\" (2002), and the romantic drama \"Room in Rome\" (\"Habitación en Roma\") (2010).\n\nThe most-important LGBT film festivals are LesGaiCineMad in Madrid and the \"Festival internacional de cinema gai i lèsbic de Barcelona\" (FICGLB). There are also many other smaller festivals and shows, including \"Festival del Mar\" in the Balearic Islands, \"Festival del Sol\" in the Canary Islands, \"Zinegoak\" in Bilbao, \"LesGaiFestiVal\" in Valencia or \"Zinentiendo\" in Zaragoza.\n\nIn 2018, Ángela Ponce became the first transgender woman to win the Miss Universe Spain title, and was the first transgender woman to contest for Miss Universe 2018.\n\nDuring Franco's dictatorship, musicians seldom made any reference to homosexuality in their songs or in public speeches. An exception was the \"copla\" singer Miguel de Molina, openly homosexual and against Franco. De Molina fled to Argentina after being brutally tortured and his shows prohibited. Another exception was Bambino, whose homosexuality was known in flamenco circles. Some songs from Raphael, as \"Qué sabe nadie\" (\"What does anyone know\") or \"Digan lo que digan\" (\"Whatever they say\"), have frequently been interpreted in a gay light.\n\nIn 1974, the folk rock band Cánovas, Rodrigo, Adolfo y Guzmán talked about a lesbian relationship in the song \"María y Amaranta\" (\"María and Amaranta\"), that surprisingly was not censored. During the transition to democracy, the duo Vainica Doble sung about the fight of a gay man against the prejudices of his own family in the song \"El rey de la casa\" (\"The king of the house\").\n\nSinger-songwriter Víctor Manuel has included LGBT subjects in several of his songs. In 1980, he released \"Quién puso más\" (\"Who put more?\"), a true love story between two men that ends after 30 years. He later mentioned transsexuality in his song \"Como los monos de Gibraltar\" (\"As the monkeys in Gibraltar\"), feminine homosexuality in \"Laura ya no vive aquí\" (\"Laura doesn't live here any more\") and bisexuality in \"No me llames loca\" (Don't call me fool/queen).\n\nIt was not until the La Movida Madrileña that homosexuality became visible in Spanish music. The duo Pedro Almodóvar and Fabio McNamara usually dressed as women during their concerts, where they sang provocative lyrics. Tino Casal never hid his homosexuality and became an icon for many gay people. Nevertheless, it would be the trio Alaska, Nacho Canut y Carlos Berlanga who would be identified from the beginning with the LGBT movement due to their constant references to homosexuality in their lyrics and their concerts. During their time as Dinarama, they recorded the song \"¿A Quién le Importa?\" (\"Who cares?\"), which became a gay anthem in Spain. After the Movida, several artists continued to make music with homosexual themes, such as Fabio McNamara, Carlos Berlanga in \"Vacaciones\" (\"Holiday\"), or Luis Miguélez, ex-guitarist of Dinarama and later member of Glamour to Kill.\n\nAt the end of the 1980s, Mecano made a hit with the song \"Mujer contra mujer\" (\"Woman against woman\"), clearly defending the love of two women. There were French (\"Une femme avec une femme\") and Italian (\"Per Lei Contro Di Lei\") versions. The song was a huge hit in France in 1990 where it reached No. 1 in charts during seven weeks. The song was also a hit in Latin America and is one of the most remembered of the group. They later composed the song \"Stereosexual\" that talked about bisexuality. In 1988, Tam Tam Go!, in the album \"Spanish shuffle\", included the song \"Manuel Raquel\", the only song in Spanish in the album, which told the story of a transsexual. Tino Casal included in his 1989 album \"Histeria\" the very explicit song \"Que digan misa\".\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, new singer-songwriters also took up the subject, especially Inma Serrano, Javier Álvarez, and Andrés Lewin, but also Pedro Guerra in his song \"Otra forma de sentir\" (\"Another way of feeling\") or Tontxu in \"¿Entiendes?\" (\"Do you understand?\"). Other artists with diverse styles also used the theme, as \"El cielo no entiende\" (\"Heaven doesn't understand\") by OBK, \"Entender el amor\" (\"Understand love\") by Mónica Naranjo, \"El día de año nuevo\" (\"New Year's Day\") by Amaral, \"Eva y María\" by Materia Prima, \"Sacrifícate\" by Amistades Peligrosas, \"La revolución sexual\" by La casa azul, \"Ángeles\" by Merche, \"Como una flor\" by Malú, \"Da igual\" by Taxi, \"El que quiera entender que entienda\" by Mägo de Oz, etc.\n\nIndie pop has also treated homosexuality from different points of view, as the band Ellos in the song \"Diferentes\" (\"Different\"), or L Kan in \"Gayhetera\" (Gayhereto). The duo Astrud has been related to gay culture. The leather subculture has the band Gore Gore Gays with themes that range from LGBT demands to explicit sex. Within the indie pop universe, many other bands produce songs almost exclusively for a gay public, especially gay-friendly or with a clear gay content (Nancys Rubias, Lorena C, Spunky, La Terremoto de Alcorcón, Putilatex, Putirecords, Borrachas provincianas, Vanity Bear, Modelé Fatale, Dos Hombres Solos, Postura 69, etc.) and some drag queens have a successful career in music, such as La Prohibida, Nacha la Macha, or La Otxoa.\n\nSeveral openly gay politicians have served in public office in Spain. One of the most prominent gay politicians is Jerónimo Saavedra, who served as President of the Canary Islands twice from 1982 to 1987 and again from 1991 to 1993. Saavedra came out as gay in 2000. He served as a member of the Senate until 2004, and was Mayor of Las Palmas from 2007 to 2011. Another prominent gay politician and activist was Pedro Zerolo, who served on the City Council of Madrid until his death in June 2015. Zerolo was known for his LGBT activism and was one of the biggest promoters of the law extending the right to marriage to same-sex couples, leading many to label him a gay icon.\n\nOthers include Javier Maroto, formerly serving as mayor of the Basque capital of Vitoria-Gasteiz from 2011 to 2015 and currently serving as senator. Maroto married his fiancé José Manuel Rodríguez in September 2015. The marriage ceremony was attended by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. Máximo Huerta, Ángeles Álvarez and Fernando Grande-Marlaska are other gay politicians who serve/have served in the Cortes Generales. Grande-Marlaska has served as Minister of the Interior since June 2018.\n\nAda Colau, elected Mayor of Barcelona in 2015, revealed her bisexuality in December 2017. Other Catalan gay politicians include Antoni Comín, Santi Vila and Miquel Iceta.\n\nCarla Antonelli, Víctor Casco, Iñigo Lamarca, Fran Ferri, Jesús Vázquez Abad, Iñaki Oyarzábal, Empar Pineda and Luis Alegre Zahonero are other openly LGBT politicians, variously serving as mayors or members of regional legislatures. In 2007, Manuela Trasobares won a seat as a councillor in the small Valencian town of Geldo, becoming the first openly transgender Spaniard to hold public office.\n\nSports is traditionally a difficult area for LGBT visibility. Recently though, there have been professional sportswomen and sportsmen who have come out. These include Mapi León and Ana Romero in football, Víctor Gutiérrez in waterpolo, Carlos Peralta in swimming, Marta Mangué in handball, Javier Raya in figure skating and Miriam Blasco in judo.\n\nIn February 2019, the right-wing party Vox vetoed a motion calling for an official stance against homophobia in sports. The motion, supported by every other political party, required unanimity to be adopted.\n"}

It is unrelated to Old World orioles (family Oriolidae). It is a breeding resident in the tropics of eastern South America. This bird is noted for its close association with the palm \"Mauritia flexuosa\" (moriche, buriti, ita, ité, etc.).\n\nThis ecologically distinct bird was formerly treated as a species Icterus chrysocephalus. It was eventually found to be embedded in the epaulet oriole (\"I. cayanensis\") clade. Thus, for example the AOU since 2005 has lumped the moriche oriole into \"I. cayanensis\". The subspecific structure of \"I. cayanensis\" is still rather puzzling.\n\nThis is a slim bird, 8.7 in (22 cm) long and weighing 1.5 oz (42 g), with a long tail and thin decurved bill. It has mainly black plumage, apart from a bright yellow crown, rump, thighs and wing epaulets. The sexes are similar, but the juvenile bird is dark brown rather than black, with duller yellow patches.\n\nThe song of the moriche oriole is a squeaky whistling \"\". This is an often-conspicuous species near its favoured tree, and usually occurs singly or in pairs.\nThe mochique oriole breeds from eastern Colombia, Venezuela, Trinidad and the Guianas, and south to eastern Ecuador, Paraguay and northern Brazil. The Trinidadian population may have originated from recent colonisation or escapes. It is most common from sea level up to 1,600 ft (500 m) ASL, but here and there it reaches up to around 3,300 ft (1,000 m) in the eastern foothills of the Andes, which mark the western border or its range.\n\nThe moriche oriole is a bird closely associated with moriche palms (\"Mauritia flexuosa\"), and it is found in the forests, swamps or savannah where that tree occurs. This bird eats mainly insects, but will also take nectar and some fruit. Its nest is a long hanging basket of grass and other plant fibres, suspended from the end of a moriche palm branch. The normal clutch is two dark-spotted pale blue or white eggs.\n\nIt is affected to some extent by trapping for the cagebird trade, but can cope with heavy disturbance to its habitat as long as some moriche palms remain.\n\n"}

In 2003, he signed to MCA Nashville Records. That same year, his debut album's title track, \"Long Black Train\", was his breakthrough single release. His second album, \"Your Man\" (2006) accounted for his first two number-one hits: \"Your Man\" and \"Would You Go with Me\", while 2007's \"Everything Is Fine\" included a No. 2 in \"Firecracker\". \"Haywire\", released in 2010, produced his biggest hit, the four week No. 1 \"Why Don't We Just Dance\" and another number one in \"All Over Me\". It was followed by \"Punching Bag\" (2012), whose lead-off single \"Time Is Love\" was the biggest country hit of 2012 according to Billboard Year-End.\n\nTurner was born in Hannah, South Carolina. Growing up in the church, he founded a gospel quartet called Thankful Hearts, where he sang bass, in addition to singing the bass and baritone parts in choirs.\n\nIn 1996, Turner developed a lesion on his right vocal cord. Turner was examined by the Vanderbilt voice clinic, where doctors advised him to let it heal on its own. Surgery was not needed, but he did have to rest his voice for a year. While Turner rested his voice back at home, he learned classical vocal technique and how to take care of his voice and avoid developing further problems. Turner states that he \"learned how to whistle really well during that year.\"\n\nAfter Hannah-Pamplico High School, he spent some time at Francis Marion University before moving to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music and enrolled in Belmont University. After college, his fledgling career got a boost on Dec. 21, 2001, during his debut on the Grand Ole Opry, when he debuted a song he wrote titled \"Long Black Train\". He received a standing ovation in the middle of the song, then sang it again for an encore.\n\nJoshua Otis Turner was born on November 20, 1977, in Florence, SC. Since early on, religion assumed an enormous job in Turner’s life, and he would sing lead and bass parts in the ensemble. He was a piece of the gospel group of four called Thankful Hearts, where he visited all through South Carolina. After secondary school, Josh moved to Nashville and took a crack at Belmont University.\n\nOn December 21, 2001, Turner debuted on the Grand Ole Opry with the song \"Long Black Train\".\n\nIn 2003, Turner released his debut album, also entitled \"Long Black Train\". Prior to its release, Turner had released 7\" vinyl singles of \"She'll Go on You\" and \"Long Black Train\". Both singles featured \"Long Black Train\" album track \"Backwoods Boy\" as a B-side. While neither \"Backwoods Boy\" nor \"She'll Go on You\" were successful (the latter peaking at No. 46 on the country charts), \"Long Black Train\" spent more than forty weeks on the \"Billboard\" country charts, reaching a peak of No. 13 and receiving a gold certification. The third single, \"What It Ain't\", was less successful, reaching No. 31.\n\nIn early 2006, Turner released his second album, \"Your Man\". The album's first single and title track, \"Your Man\", was written by Jace Everett, Chris DuBois and Chris Stapleton and released in late 2005. \"Your Man\" also climbed the charts slowly, eventually reaching No. 1 in early 2006. \"Your Man\" was certified Gold by the RIAA four weeks after its release, and went Platinum six months later.\n\n\"Would You Go with Me\" was the second single released from \"Your Man\". Like the album's title track, \"Would You Go with Me\" also reached the top of the country singles charts, holding that position for two weeks; it also reached No. 48 on the \" Billboard\" Hot 100. Turner also performed it on the CMA Awards in November 2006.\n\nShortly after the album's release, a song called \"Me and God\" was released as a single to Christian radio. A duet with bluegrass musician Ralph Stanley, the song also featured members of the band Diamond Rio on background vocals. \"Me and God\" reached a peak of No. 16 on the country charts.\n\nIn December 2006, the 49th Annual Grammy Award nominations were announced. Turner received nods for Best Male Country Vocal Performance and for Best Country Album. That same month, a featurette on CMT Insider showed Turner in the studio working on the album. He mentioned that he wanted it to sound like music in the 18th and 19th centuries. Turner performed at the Ryman Auditorium where a live album was recorded, singing a song called, \"Church in the Holler\". Turner's album \"Josh Turner: Live At The Ryman\" was recorded in April and is available exclusively through Cracker Barrel restaurants.\n\nTurner, along with veteran songwriters Brett James and Don Schlitz, wrote a song entitled \"Say Yes\"; recorded and released by singer Dusty Drake in 2007, the song was a minor Top 40 country hit for Drake, peaking at No. 36.\n\nOn September 29, 2007, while giving an award to Roy Clark on Clark's 20th anniversary on the Grand Ole Opry, Turner was invited to become a member of the Grand Ole Opry. He was inducted by Vince Gill on October 27, 2007. He is the second youngest member after Carrie Underwood.\n\nTurner's third studio album for MCA Nashville, titled \"Everything Is Fine\", was released on October 30, 2007. Its lead-off single, \"Firecracker\", became Turner's third Top Ten hit on the country music charts, peaking at No. 2. The second single from \"Everything Is Fine\", a duet with Trisha Yearwood entitled \"Another Try\", was released in late January 2008, peaking at No. 15. The title track was released as the third single and peaked at No. 20. \"Everything Is Fine\" has been certified gold.\n\nAt the end of June, Turner wrapped up recording his fourth album, \"Haywire\". The lead-off single, \"Why Don't We Just Dance\", which was released on August 12, 2009, debuted at No. 57 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs chart for the week of September 5, 2009. The song went on to become Turner's third Number One hit, spending four consecutive weeks at the top in February 2010. The album was released on February 9, 2010, along with a deluxe version. \"All Over Me\" was released in April 2010 as the album's second single; it became Turner's fourth Number One. On September 27, 2010, Turner shot the video for \"I Wouldn't Be a Man\" in Nashville, which was the third single from \"Haywire\". \"Haywire\" is now certified gold.\n\nTurner's fifth studio album, \"Punching Bag\", was released via MCA Nashville on June 12, 2012 and preceded by the single \"Time Is Love\". The song, written by Tom Shapiro, Tony Martin, and Mark Nesler, was released digitally on December 20, 2011 and went for radio adds on January 9. The song reached No. 2 but finished the year as the No. 1 country song of 2012 according to \"Billboard\". The album's second single \"Find Me a Baby\", was released to country radio on October 15, 2012, but it failed to make top 40 on the country charts.\n\nAlso in 2012, Turner released \"Live Across America\" with twelve of his songs recorded in concert in different cities. This album was distributed through Cracker Barrel. Turner said, \"Those are the most magical performances of each song.\"\n\nThe lead single from Turner's upcoming sixth studio album, \"Lay Low\", was released to country radio on September 1, 2014. It reached a peak of No. 25 on Country Airplay, at which it remained stalled at for several weeks. The single did not perform as expected on the charts, so Turner's label decided to delay the release of the album and next single. The second single, \"Hometown Girl\", was released to radio on May 31, 2016.\nAt Turner's show in Reading, PA on November 5, 2016, he announced that his new album would be released sometime in March 2017.\nThe album, titled \"Deep South\", was released on March 10, 2017, preceded by two sneak preview songs, \"Deep South\" and \"Where the Girls Are\" released on February 23, 2017. \"Deep South\" scored Turner his third No. 1 album on the US Top Country Album's Chart upon its release. Turner's second single \"Hometown Girl\" from \"Deep South\" peaked at No. 2 on Billboard's Country Airplay Chart and peaked at No. 1 on the Mediabase chart, which makes it Turner's 5th No. 1 single. \n. Turner's third single \"All About You,\" written by Craig Wiseman and Justin Weaver, was released on May 15, 2017.\n\nAfter the release of \"Deep South\", Turner began work on a project of gospel music. Titled \"I Serve a Savior\", his seventh studio album was issued on October 26, 2018. It consists of a collection of mostly gospel standards with a few original songs, including its title track that Turner co-wrote. The album also features appearances by Sonya Isaacs, Bobby Osborne, and Turner's own family (who sing and play instruments on a track penned by his wife and oldest son), and new live renditions of both \"Long Black Train\" and \"Me and God.\"\n\nTurner played George Beverly Shea in the 2008 film \"\", about the evangelist Billy Graham. Shea was the soloist for the Billy Graham Crusades.\n\nTurner has one brother and one sister. He is a devout Christian. About that he says, \"I don't believe God wants me to be a gospel singer, he just wants me to be a Christian singer. That's who I am, a Christian.\" He married his wife Jennifer Ford in 2003. They met at Belmont University, where they both attended school at the time. Jennifer travels with Josh when he's on tour, playing keyboards and singing background vocals. They have four sons, Hampton, Colby, Crawford (called Marion), and Samuel (called Hawke).\n\nOn September 19, 2019, a tour bus carrying Turner's road crew crashed in California, killing one and injuring seven others, according to the California Highway Patrol. Turner was not on the bus.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1962329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962329", "title": "Rainbow (Mariah Carey album)", "text": "Rainbow (Mariah Carey album)\n\nRainbow is the seventh studio album by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey. It was released on November 2, 1999, by Columbia Records. The album followed the same pattern as Carey's previous two albums, \"Daydream\" (1995) and \"Butterfly\" (1997), in which she began her transition into the urban market. \"Rainbow\" contains a mix of hip hop-influenced R&B jams, as well as a variety of slow ballads. On the album, Carey worked with David Foster and Diane Warren, who, as well as Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, replaced Walter Afanasieff, the main balladeer Carey worked with throughout the 90s. As a result of her separation from her husband, Tommy Mottola, Carey had more control over the musical style of this album, so she collaborated with several artists such as Jay-Z, Usher, and Snoop Dogg, as well as Missy Elliott, Joe, Da Brat, Master P, 98°, and Mystikal.\n\nOn Carey's previous album, \"Butterfly\", she began incorporating several other genres, including R&B and hip hop, into her musical repertoire. In order to further push her musical horizons, Carey featured Jay-Z on the album's lead single, the first time in her career that another artist was featured on one of her lead singles. Carey wrote ballads that were closer to R&B than pop for this album, and worked with Snoop Dogg and Usher on songs such as \"Crybaby\" and \"How Much,\" both of which featured strong R&B beats and grooves. Several of the ballads that Carey wrote during this period, including \"Thank God I Found You\" (written with Terry Lewis) and \"After Tonight\" (written with Diane Warren), mirrored sentiments she experienced in her personal life.\n\nFive singles were released from the album, two of which became number-one hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, making \"Rainbow\" her seventh-consecutive studio album to produce a number-one song. The album's lead single, \"Heartbreaker\" featuring Jay-Z, became Carey's fourteenth number-one hit on the Hot 100, and topped the charts in Canada and New Zealand. \"Thank God I Found You,\" featuring Joe and 98 Degrees, also topped the Hot 100, but achieved moderate international charting. The next two singles, \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme) and \"Crybaby\" featuring Snoop Dogg, were released as a double A-side. The songs were at the center of a public feud in between Carey and Sony due to Sony's alleged weak promotion of the singles. Carey's cover of Phil Collins' \"Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)\" with Westlife peaked at number one in Ireland, Scotland and the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Rainbow\" was well received by critics, who generally praised Carey's embrace of R&B and hip hop in her music. The album debuted at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200, with first week sales of 323,000. It was her first album in years to not reach number one. However, within a month, \"Rainbow\" was certified triple-Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of three million copies within the United States. Internationally, the album debuted atop the charts in France, and within the top five in Australia, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Japan, and Switzerland. The album has sold an estimated eight million copies worldwide.\n\nSince her debut in 1990, Carey's career was heavily calculated and controlled by her husband and head of her label Sony Music Entertainment, Tommy Mottola. For years, Carey's albums had consisted of slow and meaningful ballads, devoid of any guest appearances or hip hop-influenced melodies. In January 1995, as she recorded \"Daydream\", Carey began taking more control over her musical style and genre influences. She enlisted the production skills and rap styles of Ol' Dirty Bastard, who was featured on the remix of her song \"Fantasy.\" While Mottola was hesitant at first, Carey's persistence paid off when the song became an international chart topper, with critics calling the collaboration one of the pioneering songs of pop and R&B musical collaborations.\n\nDuring the recording and production of Carey's \"Butterfly\" in 1997, she and Mottola separated, giving Carey an extended amount of control over the unfinished album. Following their separation, Carey began working with younger hip hop and R&B producers and songwriters, aside from her usual work with balladeers Walter Afanasieff and Kenneth Edmonds. While the album incorporated several different genres and components that were not present in Carey's previous releases, \"Butterfly\" also included a balance of her classic ballads and newer R&B-infused jams. While Sony accepted Carey's new collaborations with writers and producers such as P. Diddy and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, they continued to focus their promotion on the ballads. After \"Honey,\" the debut single from \"Butterfly\", was released in August 1997, Sony halted the release of the succeeding R&B-influenced jams, and released the ballad \"My All\" as the second worldwide single. \"Rainbow\" followed in its predecessors' footsteps, featuring even more hip hop and R&B.\n\nDuring the spring of 1999, Carey began working on the final album of her record contract with Sony, her ex-husband's label. Carey's lover at the time, Luis Miguel, was in the midst of a European tour. In order to spend more time with him, she opted to record the album on the secluded island of Capri, Italy, figuring the seclusion would also help her complete the album sooner. During this time, Carey's strained relationship with Sony affected her work with writing partner Afanasieff, who had worked extensively with Carey throughout the first half of her career. Aside from their growing creative differences, Mottola had given Afanasieff more opportunities to work with other artists. She felt Mottola was trying to separate her from Afanasieff, in hopes of keeping their relationship permanently strained. Due to the pressure and the awkward relationship Carey had now developed with Sony, she completed the album in a period of three months in the summer of 1999, quicker than any of her other albums. In an interview with \"Blitz TV\", Carey spoke of her decision to record the album in Capri:\n\nI love New York. But if I'm there, I want to go out, friends come to the studio, the phone rings constantly. But in Capri, I am in a remote place, and there is no one I can run into. I felt that in Capri I would be able to effectively finish the album on a shorter schedule. And I did. I made it in three months, I was like 'Get me off this label!' I couldn't take it. The situation there [Sony] was becoming increasingly difficult.\n\nLike her previous releases, Carey co-wrote and co-produced the album's material, working with several hip hop and R&B producers such as Jay-Z, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Usher, Snoop Dogg, Missy Elliott, Jermaine Dupri, and Brian Michael Cox. For the album's debut single release, Carey collaborated with Jay-Z and DJ Clue. During the spring of 1999, Carey began working with Clue on several hooks and melodies for the lead single. After a few hours, they decided to include a hip hop star on the track, which eventually led to Jay-Z. Carey's longtime friend and back-up vocalist Trey Lorenz, who was featured on her remake of the Jackson 5 song \"I'll Be There,\" added \"some soft male [back-up] vocals.\" Carey worked with Lewis and Jam on the ballad \"Thank God I Found You.\" She had already been in the studio with the duo several times when she contacted them to meet her at the studio, where she told them that she had come up with the title, hook, and melody. Usually, when Carey was writing the songs for \"Rainbow\", James \"Big Jim\" Wright would play the organ or piano and assist Carey to find the \"right melody.\" However, since Wright was not present, Lewis played the organ while Carey directed him with her lower registers, providing the chord progression. They composed the song and recorded Carey's vocals. Knowing she wanted to introduce a male vocalist on the track, Lewis brought R&B singer Joe and pop group 98 Degrees into the studio. After a few hours, the group and Joe had recorded all their vocals and the song was complete. In an interview with Bronson, Lewis discussed the night Carey wrote \"Thank God I Found You:\"\n\nIt all happened that night. She told us the title of the song, the concept and sang us the melody. We usually have Big Jim Wright sit in on those kind of sessions to work out the chords. he wasn't there so I had to work on the chord myself. So I was playing and there was a part where I said 'Man, what chord am I supposed to do here?' and Mariah has such a good ear that she sang me the chord.\nWhile the album was immersed further into mainstream R&B territory, Carey included some of her classic ballads and tender love songs on the album, working with writers and producers such as David Foster and Diane Warren. The idea to work with Warren was suggested by Foster, who thought that the two would be able to \"hammer out one hell of a ballad\" together. The two wrote and produced the song titled \"After Tonight.\" Carey felt the song was a perfect metaphor for her relationship with Miguel, describing their romance in Capri. While the song was deemed a success by both parties, they described their working relationship with mixed feelings. According to Foster, who was involved in the writing session, Carey and Warren would not always agree on the lyrics and melodious structure of the song. He described it as a \"give and take relationship\"; Warren would offer lyrics and Carey would not like them; she wanted something more intricate and detailed. Carey would produce a hook or lyrics that Warren did not feel were a perfect fit. In the end, Foster felt that they worked \"well together.\" After recording the song, Carey invited Miguel to record the song with her as a duet. However, after recording his verses several times, Foster and Carey realized that the song would not turn out the way they planned. Foster said the song's key was \"too high for him\"; the voices did not harmonize well. Carey did not have time to re-record her vocals in a lower key to accommodate Miguel's verses. Miguel, furious over the failed collaboration, later sent a cut-up tape of the demo to Foster. Carey, Warren, and Foster also wrote \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme),\" one of the other ballads featured on \"Rainbow\".\n\nAs with \"Butterfly\", songs for \"Rainbow\" were chosen to solidify Carey's reputation as a multi-genre artist. Throughout the first phase of her career, Carey's albums predominantly consisted of pop and adult contemporary ballads. \"Rainbow\" mixed hip hop and R&B-flavored upbeat songs with softer and lyrically intense ballads resembling those that Carey had previously recorded. \"Heartbreaker,\" Carey's first collaboration with Jay-Z, used a sample from \"Attack of the Name Game,\" recorded by Stacy Lattisaw, as its hook. The loop originated from \"The Name Game\" by Shirley Ellis; Ellis and co-writer Lincoln Chase are credited as songwriters on the track. Carey incorporated the hook into the song's melody, and added instrumentation. Lyrically, the song chronicles the heartbreak the protagonist feels after learning of her lover's infidelity. \"Thank God I Found You\" features vocals from Joe and 98 Degrees, as well as songwriting and production from Carey and Lewis. According to Carey, the song reflects on events in her own life at the time, with the lyrics describing the completion the protagonist feels after \"finding\" their lover. Joe provides the main male vocal throughout each verse, and 98 Degrees sing the background vocals and the bridge.\n\nPrior to the album's recording, Mariah and her sister, Alison Carey had a falling out in their relationship. Alison had contracted AIDS in 1988, when she was 27, and in 1994 she blamed Mariah for many of her problems and heartbreaks throughout the years. Her children were taken away while she received treatment for AIDS and for mental health issues. Carey wrote a song titled \"Petals,\" which she describes as the most honest lyrics she has ever written. The song tells of Carey's feelings for her sister, while illustrating the pain Allison's betrayal and suffering have caused. In an interview with Bronson, Carey described the meaning of the lyrics of \"Petals\":\n\nIt is a great outlet for me to go into the studio and write a song like 'Petals', which is one of my most personal songs and remains one of my favorites. I think [it had the most] honest lyrics I've ever written. The song chronicles a lot of past emotions I've felt to certain people close to me, and the way I feel towards them and how their actions have impacted me personally. For that reason, I sang in my lower registers, trying to add that breathy effect to go hand in hand with the song's composition.\n\n\"After Tonight\" was a song Carey wrote with David Foster and Diane Warren. Carey had strong feelings about the song, as she wrote it about her relationship with Luis Miguel. The song was compared instrumentally to \"My All\" from \"Butterfly\", which features traces of Latin and guitar instrumentation. In the lyrics, the protagonist asks her lover if he will still love her and come back to her \"after tonight.\" Carey's cover of the Phil Collins song \"Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)\" was originally intended to be a solo ballad. The song was re-done after the album was released, with music by the Irish band Westlife replacing the song's instrumental bridge. \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\" was one of the album's most uplifting ballads, lyrically serving as an anthem for fans and listeners. The message, Carey said, was a personal theme of hers growing up, of not letting others \"bring her down\" and not allowing them to take away the light inside her.\n\"How Much\" is a duet with Usher and features a sample from Tupac Shakur's \"Me and My Girlfriend.\"\n\nAs with \"Butterfly\" two years earlier, \"Rainbow\" became the center of conflict between Carey and her label. After her divorce from Sony record official and Columbia CEO Tommy Mottola, Carey's working relationship with the label deteriorated. She intended for \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\" to be the third single from \"Rainbow\", as it held very personal lyrical content. However, Sony made it clear that they intended the third single should be a more upbeat and urban track. The difference in opinion led to a very public feud, as Carey began posting messages on her webpage in early and mid-2000, telling fans inside information on the dispute, as well as instructing them to request \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\" on radio stations. One of the messages Carey left on her page read:\n\nBasically, a lot of you know the political situation in my professional career is not positive. It's been really, really hard. I don't even know if this message is going to get to you because I don't know if they want you to hear this. I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people. But I am not willing to give up.\n\nCarey's actions were given mixed reception, with critics and executives commending her bold actions regarding a song she felt needed to be heard, while others criticized her for publicizing the dispute further. Soon after, Sony stripped Carey's webpage of messages and began negotiations. Fearing to lose their label's highest seller and the best-selling artist of the decade, Sony chose to release the song. Carey, initially content with the agreement, soon found out that the song had only been given a very limited and low-promotion release, which meant the song failed to chart on the official US chart, and made international charting extremely difficult and unlikely.\n\nPrior to the album's release, Carey made an appearance on \"Pavarotti & Friends for Guatemala and Kosovo\", performing \"My All\" and \"Hero\" alongside Luciano Pavarotti in a live duet. The concert benefit was filmed live in Modena, Italy, during the summer of 1999 and was released for sale on September 21, with funds being donated to relief efforts for natural disasters in Guatemala and Kosovo. Carey made several live television and award show appearances at this time, and recorded her own Fox Broadcasting Company special, titled \"The Mariah Carey Homecoming Special\". A mini-concert filmed at Carey's old high school in Huntington, New York, the special aired on Fox on December 21, 1999. Carey performed \"Heartbreaker\" and its accompanying remix at the MTV European Music Awards, held on November 11, 1999, in Dublin, Ireland. Additionally, the song was performed on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", the British music chart program \"Top of the Pops\", and \"The Today Show\", which included a performance of \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\" and \"Hero.\" \"Thank God I Found You was performed live at the 2000 American Music Awards as well as on several European programs, including \"Top of the Pops\" and \"Friday Night's All Wright\" in the United Kingdom, NRJ and \"Soulier d'Or\" in France, \"Wetten, dass..?\" in Germany, and \"Quelli che... il Calcio\" in Italy. The album's final two releases, \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\" and \"Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now),\" were performed on \"The View\" and at the 2000 Blockbuster Entertainment Awards.\n\nIn order to promote \"Rainbow\", Carey embarked of her fourth headlining and third worldwide tour. Titled the Rainbow World Tour, it included nineteen shows: six in Europe, four in Asia, eight in the United States, and one in Canada. For Carey's previous two tours, she had only visited Europe and Asia, due to the mixed reception of her debut stateside tour in 1993. However, after achieving record-breaking ticket sales throughout Asia and instant sellouts in Europe, Carey felt secure enough to once again tour her native country. The set list featured songs from most of Carey's previous studio albums, as well as some tracks from \"Rainbow\". Missy Elliott and Da Brat served as opening acts for the US leg of the tour. Ticket sales were very strong; the entire US leg sold out in a matter of days. The Asian and European leg mirrored the commercial success of her previous two tours. Reviews for the tour varied from positive to mixed. Some critics and fans reproached her of having a \"tired and hoarse voice,\" while others commented on Carey's choice of wardrobe. Several critics and many concert-goers praised the tour, calling it an intense celebration of Carey's career.\n\nFive singles were released from \"Rainbow\"; two were worldwide international releases and three were limited promotional releases. \"Heartbreaker,\" the album's first worldwide release, became Carey's fourteenth chart topper in the United States. Aside from staying atop the US chart for two weeks, the song reached the chart's summit in Canada and New Zealand. Elsewhere, \"Heartbreaker\" achieved high charting, peaking within the top five in France and the United Kingdom, and within the top ten in Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland. The song received mixed reviews from critics. Arion Berger from \"Rolling Stone\" called the song Carey's \"most insinuating: nasal, silken, declarative, riding the percolating beat.\" However, while dismissing some of the song's vocals and the incorporation of the hook, he complimented its marriage of pop and hip hop through Jay-Z's verses. The song's music video became one of the most expensive music videos of all time, costing an estimated $2.5 million. The video features Carey visiting a movie theater with her friends, where she finds her lover with another woman. \"Thank God I Found You\" was released as the second worldwide single from the album. While becoming Carey's fifteenth chart topper in the US, the song achieved moderate chart success in Europe and other territories. Berger called it a \"gospel soar\" and complimented Carey's vocals, as well as the harmonies by 98 Degrees. The music video features footage from a live concert with Carey and the band performing the song.\n\n\"Crybaby\" and \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\" were released simultaneously as a double A-side, with very limited promotion from Sony. These two songs, especially the latter, became the center of a very public controversy between Carey and her label, due to their alleged low promotion of the album. Carey and Snoop Dogg were featured in the music video for \"Crybaby,\" with Carey playing an anxious woman who can't sleep at night due to her lover's infidelity. A music video for \"Can't Take That Away\" was released around the same time, which features Carey on a rooftop garden. Carey sings during a rain storm, and towards the video's conclusion, the sun arises, bring forth a \"new day.\" The final single from \"Rainbow\", \"Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now),\" was given a limited release as well. After performing moderately around the world, a new version of the song, featuring Westlife, was released in Ireland and the United Kingdom. It became successful there, peaking at number one in both territories, and became Carey's second UK chart topper. The song's video features Carey and Westlife on a boat in Capri. Scenes of the group exploring the island are cut with scenes of them in the studio, though Carey never re-recorded her vocals from the original version.\n\n\"Rainbow\" received positive reviews from critics, many of whom noted the new direction in Carey's music. In \"Entertainment Weekly\", Danyel Smith wrote that \"what began on \"Butterfly\" as a departure ends up on \"Rainbow\" a progression – perhaps the first compelling proof of Carey's true colors as an artist.\" Arion Berger from \"Rolling Stone\" viewed it as a genuine R&B and hip hop album, a \"sterling chronicle of the state of accessible hip-hop balladeering at the close of 1999.\" Aside from calling some of the ballads \"banal,\" Berger concluded his review that \"\"Rainbow\" is at its best—and Carey at her most comfortable—when urbane hip-hop stylings and faux R&B coexist in smooth middle-of-the-road harmony.\" Elysa Gardner from the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote in her review: \"Exhibiting an emotional authority to match her technical prowess, Carey gives us a vision of love that's dynamic without being ostentatious.\" Steve Jones from \"USA Today\" deemed the record \"colorful\" and \"some of her most compelling work.\" \"Village Voice\" critic Robert Christgau gave the album a two-star honorable mention, indicating a \"likable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well enjoy.\" He cited \"Heartbreaker\" and \"Crybaby\" as highlights while writing that Carey was \"not a 'real' r&b thrush, but good enough to fake it.\"\n\nAmy Linden from \"Vibe\" was less impressed by the album, particularly the songs on which Carey sings over hip hop samples or alongside guest rappers, deeming it a commonplace formula--\"pairing a singing thrush with a rhyming thug.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic said it was \"the first Carey album where she's written personal lyrics, and allusions to her separation from Mottola.\" He called the lyrics \"true\" and \"deep,\" but found the songs \"ballad-heavy\" and \"repetitious,\" adding that the album followed the formula of Carey's previous records too precisely. In his opinion, \"it would have been a more effective album if the heartbreak, sorrow, and joy that bubbles underneath the music were brought to the surface.\"\n\n\"Rainbow\" debuted at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart with 323,000 units sold, the highest first-week sales of Carey's career at that time. In its second week, the album stayed at number two, selling an additional 228,000 copies, barred from the top by Faith Hill's \"Breathe\". In its eighth week, \"Rainbow\" experienced its highest weekly sales—during the Christmas week of 1999—selling 369,000 copies, while placing at number nine. It became Carey's first studio album since \"Merry Christmas\" (1994) to not reach the top position in the United States. In total, \"Rainbow\" stayed in the top twenty for ten weeks and on the chart for thirty-five, making one re-entry. It was certified triple-Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of three million copies throughout the United States. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album's sales in the US are estimated at 2,968,000 copies. In Canada, \"Rainbow\" debuted at number two on the Canadian Albums Chart, and was certified triple-Platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA). Sales in Canada are estimated at 300,000 units.\n\n\"Rainbow\" debuted at number three on the Australian Albums Chart, staying within the chart for seven weeks. The album was Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), denoting shipments of 70,000 copies. In France, the album experienced strong success, debuting atop the albums chart and remaining inside the top forty for thirty-four weeks. The album was certified triple-Platinum by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP), with estimated sales of 900,000 copies. In Germany, \"Rainbow\" peaked at number three, and received a Platinum certification from the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI), denoting shipments of 500,000 units. in the United Kingdom Rainbow debuted at number eight and stayed within the top 100 for 20 weeks. \"Rainbow\" was certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), denoting shipments of 300,000 units. Additionally, \"Rainbow\" received Platinum certification in Brazil, with 250,000 copies, Platinum in New Zealand, triple-Platinum in Spain, Platinum in Argentina,<ref name=\"Argentina's Gold/Platinum Certifications for Mariah Carey\"></ref> Gold in Belgium, Platinum in the Netherlands, and Gold in Switzerland. The album has sold an estimated eight million copies worldwide.\n\nNotes\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nProduction\n\n\nWorks cited\n"}
{"id": "1962338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962338", "title": "Damon Lindelof", "text": "Damon Lindelof\n\nDamon Laurence Lindelof (born April 24, 1973) is an American screenwriter, comic book writer, and producer. He was the co-creator and showrunner of the television series \"Lost\" (2004–10). He has written for and produced \"Crossing Jordan\" (2001–04) and wrote for \"Nash Bridges\" (2000–01). Lindelof also co-wrote the science fiction films \"Cowboys & Aliens\" (2011), \"Prometheus\" (2012), \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" (2013), and \"Tomorrowland\" (2015). He co-created the TV series \"The Leftovers\" for HBO, adapted from the novel by Tom Perrotta, and he also created and ran HBO's \"Watchmen\".\n\nLindelof was born in Teaneck, New Jersey, the son of Susan Klausner, a teacher, and David Lindelof, a bank manager. He attended Teaneck High School, a school whose diverse student body he credits with expanding his horizons as a writer. Lindelof's mother is Jewish, and his father is of Scandinavian descent. \n\nLindelof celebrated his Bar Mitzvah in Teaneck, where he attended synagogue for the Sabbath; he has stated, \"I was a Jewish white kid growing up in Teaneck, but at the same time, I had African and Filipino and Asian friends and to have that experience all through high school while getting an awesome education was wonderful.\" Lindelof attended film school at New York University, performing briefly in the band Petting Zoo, and moved to Los Angeles after graduating.\n\nLindelof frequently collaborates with a tightly knit group of film professionals which include J. J. Abrams, Adam Horowitz, Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, Edward Kitsis, Andre Nemec, Josh Appelbaum, Jeff Pinkner, and Bryan Burk.\n\nAn early boost to his writing career came in 1999, when he was selected as a semifinalist for a Nicholl Fellowship for his screenplay \"Perfectionists\". Before this, he had worked on reviewing scripts at Paramount, Fox, and Alan Ladd studios.\n\nLindelof was an executive producer and joint showrunner (alongside Carlton Cuse) on \"Lost\". Lindelof and the \"Lost\" writing staff won the Writers Guild of America (WGA) Award for Best Dramatic Series at the February 2006 ceremony for their work on the first and second seasons. He was nominated for the WGA Award for Best Dramatic Series a further three times. At the February 2007 ceremony for his work on the second and third seasons, at the February 2009 ceremony for his work on the fourth season and at the February 2010 ceremony for his work on the fifth season. Lindelof and his co-writer Drew Goddard were also nominated for the WGA Award for Best Episodic Drama at the February 2008 ceremony for writing the episode \"\"Flashes Before Your Eyes\".\"\n\n\"Lost\" was praised for its unique brand of storytelling and strong characters. The first two seasons of the show were ratings juggernauts and the show never fell out of the Top 30 throughout its six seasons on the air. Lindelof and co-showrunner Carlton Cuse have been heralded as two of the first to truly embrace the changing times with things such as their daily podcast and being active in the fan community. A majority of the six seasons were met with critical praise, however, both Lindelof and Cuse were not afraid to address critiques on the show, be it through the podcast or other forms of media. However, Lindelof said in late 2013 that he would no longer be addressing those displeased with the way the show ended stating, \"And what do I do? I jump at the opportunity to acknowledge how many people were dissatisfied with how it ended. I try to be self-deprecating and witty when I do this, but that's an elaborate (or obvious?) defense mechanism to let people know I'm fully aware of the elephant in the room and I'm perfectly fine with it sitting down on my face and shitting all over me... And here's my part: I will finally stop talking about it. I'm not doing this because I feel entitled or above it — I'm doing it because I accept that I will not change hearts nor minds. I will not convince you they weren't dead the whole time, nor resent you for believing they were despite my infinite declarations otherwise.\" \n\nLindelof is the writer of the six-issue comic-book miniseries \"Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk\" for Marvel Comics, which takes place in the Ultimate Marvel universe. It began publication in January 2006. Production was suspended after the second issue in February 2006 due to Lindelof's heavy workload elsewhere. The last of the scripts was submitted to Marvel in 2008 and the series resumed publication in March 2009.\n\nLindelof wrote a Rip Hunter story for \"Time Warp\" No. 1 (May 2013) which was drawn by Jeff Lemire and published by Vertigo.\n\nFollowing the end of \"Lost\", it was rumored that Lindelof and J. J. Abrams would write and direct a film adaptation of Stephen King's The Dark Tower series. Lindelof dismissed this in a Q&A with \"USA Today\" in late 2009. He commented, \"After working six years on \"Lost\", the last thing I want to do is spend the next seven years adapting one of my favorite books of all time. I'm such a massive Stephen King fan that I'm terrified of screwing it up. I'd do anything to see those movies written by someone else. My guess is they will get made because they're so incredible. But not by me.\"\nHe served as co-producer on the 2009 film, \"Star Trek\". He produced its sequel, \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" and cowrote its screenplay with Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci. Kurtzman and Orci, with Lindelof, and several other writers contributed to the screenplay of the film version of the comic book series \"Cowboys & Aliens\".\n\nHe co-wrote Ridley Scott's \"Prometheus\", released in June 2012.\n\nIn 2012, he co-wrote the screenplay for \"Tomorrowland\" with director Brad Bird, based on a story by Lindelof, Bird and Jeff Jensen.\n\nLindelof was featured on a December 2008 episode of \"The Write Environment\", a public television series featuring in-depth, candid one-on-one interviews with some of TV's most prolific and well-known series creator and writers. The interview is also available on DVD.\n\nIn 2011, Lindelof aided in development of \"Once Upon a Time\", which was created by former \"Lost\" writers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. He was not officially credited in the pilot.\n\nIn 2013, Lindelof co-created the HBO series \"The Leftovers\" with Tom Perrotta, based on Perrotta's novel of the same name. He also served as showrunner and executive producer throughout the show's three seasons.\n\nIn August 2018, it was announced that Lindelof would be adapting Alan Moore's \"Watchmen\" as a series for HBO. He had previously been quoted as saying it was his favorite graphic novel and a huge inspiration on Lost.\n\nIn 2019, Lindelof joined a host of other writers in firing their agents as part of the WGA's stand against the ATA and the practice of packaging.\n\nLindelof is a self-professed Stephen King fan and has placed many references to King's work into \"Lost\", as well as mentioning within the Official Lost Podcast that \"The Stand\" serves as a huge influence. Lindelof has been quoted as saying that the graphic novel \"Watchmen\", written by Alan Moore, is the greatest piece of popular fiction ever produced, and its effect on \"Lost\" is evident many times in the show. He has also mentioned David Lynch's \"Twin Peaks\" as a big influence for \"Lost\". J. J. Abrams has often cited Patrick McGoohan's similarly allegorical sci-fi/spy series \"The Prisoner\" as another major influence on \"Lost\". Lindelof lists his favorite six films, in no particular order, as \"Touch of Evil\", \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", \"Pulp Fiction\", \"The Shining\", \"Bambi\", and \"The Godfather Part II\". Lindelof is also a fan of the television series \"The Wire\", \"Breaking Bad\", and \"Battlestar Galactica\".\n\nLindelof married Heidi Mary Fugeman in 2005; the couple have one child.\n\nLindelof was at the center of controversy after tweeting, of the 2012 Aurora shooting, that he would be seeing \"The Dark Knight Rises\" and suggested that other filmgoers should stay in their seats after the credits for a moment of silence. Lindelof deleted his Twitter account on October 14, 2013, the date of \"the departure\" on his then-upcoming HBO show, \"The Leftovers\". Lindelof stopped his final tweet in mid-sentence leaving his followers to wonder in regards to the significance. Lindelof's final tweet read, \"After much thought and deliberation, I've decided t.\" Lindelof later said that he felt as though his time on Twitter was consuming him in a negative fashion and that he has no intentions of returning to the site.\n\n"}
{"id": "1962339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962339", "title": "1967 NFL playoffs", "text": "1967 NFL playoffs\n\nThe NFL playoffs following the 1967 NFL season culminated in the NFL championship game on New Year's Eve, and determined who would represent the league against the American Football League champions in Super Bowl II.\n\nWith 16 teams in the league in 1967, this was the first season that the NFL used a four-team playoff tournament. The four division winners advanced to the postseason, with the two division winners in each conference meeting in the first round (effectively being conference championship games). The championship game this year was the famous Ice Bowl, played in Green Bay on December 31.\n\nAlthough the Baltimore Colts (11–1–2) had tied for the best record in the league, they lost the new division tie-breaker (point differential in head-to-head games) to the Los Angeles Rams and were excluded from the postseason. The teams had tied in mid-October in Baltimore and the Colts entered the last game undefeated, but lost 34–10 to the Rams in Los Angeles on December 17. In previous seasons, unscheduled tiebreaker games were played (with head-to-head results disregarded); the last was just two years earlier.\n\nWithin each conference, the two division winners qualified for the playoffs. In the first round, the Capitol Division winner met the Century Division winner in the Eastern Conference game, while the Coastal Division winner faced the Central Division winner in the Western Conference game. The conference champions advanced to the NFL Championship Game, whose winner played the American Football League champion in Super Bowl II at the Orange Bowl in Miami on January 14. The losers of the conference championship games met in the third place Playoff Bowl, also in Miami, on January 7.\n\nPrior to , the playoff sites rotated and were known prior to the start of the season. In 1967, the hosts were the Capitol and Central division winners for the conference championships (first round), and the Western Conference for the championship game, effectively giving home field advantage to the Central Division winner, the two-time defending NFL champion Green Bay Packers, who clinched their division title with three games remaining. The 1968 playoff hosts were Century, Coastal, and Eastern, respectively, and 1969 was like 1967.\n\nThe rotation system forced the Rams (11–1–2) to play at the Packers (9–4–1) in the Western Conference playoff. It had no effect in the Eastern Conference; Cleveland and Dallas were both 9–5, and the Cowboys defeated the Browns during the regular season. With the rotation system it was common for the host team to have an inferior record; it had occurred in four of the previous five NFL championship games (1962, 1964, 1965, 1966), with the home teams winning twice (1964, 1965).\n\n<br>\nThe Rams came into the Western Conference Championship with all the momentum, possessing the NFL's best record, but having barely beaten the Packers two weeks earlier by a score of 27–24. In that game in Los Angeles, the Rams blew a 4th quarter lead, and needed a last-second touchdown set up by a blocked punt to pull out the game and keep their division title hopes alive, while the Packers had already clinched their division (and had home field in the playoffs) and were playing only for pride. In this postseason game, Green Bay would be playing for more than pride, as they were attempting win a third consecutive NFL title, unprecedented in the playoff era. The weather was expected to be cold and snowy; the snow held off but the temperature was . However, the field condition was poor, and the Rams had accused the Packers of over watering the field to slow down the devastating pass rush of the Rams' Fearsome Foursome, who sacked Starr six times in the game in L.A. For three weeks prior, the field at County Stadium was covered by a tarpaulin and thirty tons of hay. \n\nBy the end of the game, LA forced four turnovers, three fumble recoveries and an interception. But they were only able to convert one of them into a score, a first quarter fumble by Carroll Dale that was recovered by defensive back Chuck Lamson on the Rams' 46-yard line. This set up Roman Gabriel's 29-yard touchdown pass to Bernie Casey, giving the Rams a 7–0 lead. But this was all the Rams could do in the first half, as Green Bay's defense took over. Three times, they would drive into Green Bay territory, and each time they would fail to score. Lamson's interception of a Bart Starr pass resulted in nothing when Dave Robinson blocked Bruce Gossett's 24-yard field goal attempt. The Rams also lost the ball twice in Packers territory as a result of failed 4th down conversion attempts.\n\nIn the second quarter, Green Bay defensive back Tom Brown returned a punt 39 yards to the Rams 46-yard line. On the next play, rookie Travis Williams raced 46 yards for Green Bay's first touchdown. Later on, Gossett's 46-yard field goal attempt fell short of the goal posts, and Willie Wood returned the ball 44 yards to the Packers' 45. The Packers then drove 55 yards in 10 plays to score on Starr's 18-yard touchdown pass to Dale, giving the team a 14–7 lead going into halftime.\n\nLed by Jerry Kramer and Forrest Gregg, the Packers' offensive line neutralized the vaunted \"Fearsome Foursome\" of Los Angeles. Where they had thoroughly harassed Starr in the Rams' victory two weeks before, Starr was sacked only once in the playoff contest. The Packers defensive line took Gabriel down five times (3.5 of the sacks were by Henry Jordan) and pressured him into throwing inaccurate passes all day. Early in the third quarter, LA recovered another Green Bay fumble, giving them a first down on the Packers' 26-yard line. But this drive ended with no points when Gossett missed another field goal try, this one a 37-yard attempt. The Packers then drove 80 yards to go up 21–7 on Chuck Mercein's 6-yard touchdown run. In the 4th quarter, Starr's 48-yard completion to Dale set up the final score on a 3-yard touchdown run by Williams. This was the only NFL playoff game ever held at Milwaukee County Stadium.\n\nStarr completed 17 of 23 passes for 222 yards and a touchdown, with 1 interception, while also rushing for 8 yards. Dale caught 6 passes for 109 yards and a score. Williams rushed for 88 yards and two touchdowns, while also catching an 8-yard pass. Gabriel completed just 11 of 31 passes for 186 yards and a touchdown, with 1 interception. Casey caught 5 passes for 81 yards and a touchdown. Lamson had two fumble recoveries and an interception.\n\nLike the Dallas Cowboys, the wildly inconsistent Cleveland Browns underachieved themselves to a 9–5 record. The Browns featured one of the best running games in the league with Leroy Kelly, while the Cowboys had one of the best run defenses in the game. \"Dandy\" Don Meredith, the Cowboys quarterback, had been hampered by injuries all year, but Meredith was fully recovered for the contest with the Browns, completing 10 of his 12 pass attempts for 212 yards and 2 touchdowns.\n\nDallas scored on their opening drive, moving the ball 80 yards in 13 plays, including a 24-yard run by Don Perkins, to score on Meredith's 3-yard touchdown pass to running back Craig Baynham. Later in the first quarter, Cowboys receiver Bob Hayes returned a punt 64 yards before punter Gary Collins tackled him on the Browns' 13-yard line. Four plays later, Perkins crashed through the line for a 1-yard touchdown run on fourth down to give Dallas a 14–0 lead.\n\nIn the second quarter, Cleveland seemed ready to respond when Leroy Kelly took off for a 46-yard run to the Cowboys' 10-yard line. But after being forced into a 4th down situation, a bad snap spoiled Lou Groza's field goal attempt. Dallas took over on their own 10-yard line, and two plays later, Hayes raced past Browns cornerback Mike Howell, caught a pass from Meredith past midfield, and took it all the way to the end zone for an 86-yard touchdown reception. Following a punt, Dallas drove 52 yards in 9 plays to score on Danny Villanueva's 10-yard field goal, giving them a 24–0 lead. With time running out in the second quarter, Cleveland quarterback Frank Ryan put together a last second touchdown drive, completing a 15-yard pass to Kelly and two passes to tight end Milt Morin for gains of 10 and 12 yards (the 12-yard reception converted a 4th and 11 situation). With just 4 seconds left on the clock, Ryan cut the score to 24–7 with a 13-yard touchdown pass to Morin.\n\nStill any hopes of a comeback were quickly dashed in the second half, as Meredith completed a 36-yard pass to Hayes on the Browns' 4-yard line that set up Baynham's 1-yard touchdown run, putting the Cowboys up 31–7. Cleveland responded with a drive to midfield, but this was stopped cold when Kelly was stuffed for no gain on 4th and 1. The Browns managed to prevent a score when linebacker Dale Lindsey recovered a fumble from Lance Rentzel on the Browns' 18-yard line, but their offense ended up punting again, and Hayes returned it 68 yards to the Cleveland 2. Three plays later, Perkins' 1-yard touchdown made the score 38–7. Then it became 45–7 when Cornell Green intercepted Ryan's pass and returned it 60 yards for a touchdown.\n\nMeredith was replaced by Craig Morton for most of the fourth quarter, but Dallas still managed to put together another touchdown drive, moving the ball 57 yards to Baynham's 3rd touchdown of the game, this one on a 1-yard run. Meanwhile, all Cleveland could do was cut the final score to 52–14 when Ryan threw a 75-yard touchdown pass to Paul Warfield with 2:12 left in the game.\n\nHayes finished the game with five receptions for 144 yards and 3 punt returns for 141. His 141 punt return yards was an NFL playoff record until broken by Anthony Carter in the 1987 playoffs. His special teams effort would make a huge difference, as both teams were fairly even in yards gained (401 for Dallas, 322 for Cleveland) and turnovers (2 for Cleveland, 1 for Dallas) Perkins rushed for 74 yards and two touchdowns, while also catching a 4-yard pass. Ryan finished the game 14/30 for 194 yards, with two touchdowns and 1 interception. Kelly rushed for 96 yards and caught 4 passes for 39. Warfield caught 3 passes for 99 yards and a touchdown.\n"}

Superintendent Walsh was assigned in 1875 to establish a post in the Cypress Hills in what is now Saskatchewan. He named it Fort Walsh after himself. The location of the post was determined by the Cypress Hills Massacre in 1873, an atrocity stemming from the illegal American whiskey trade. Walsh's original role was to shut down this trade, but in June 1876 his position grew in importance when several thousand Sioux crossed the border into Canada, taking refuge there after the Battle of Little Big Horn. They settled near the Wood Mountain post in present-day Saskatchewan.\n\nWalsh developed a strong friendship with the famous Sioux leader Sitting Bull and successfully kept peace in the region. By the summer of 1877, Walsh, although still in command of Fort Walsh, spent little time there. His headquarters became the Wood Mountain post, among Sitting Bull and 5,000 Sioux. During this time, Walsh became famous in the American press as \"Sitting Bull's Boss.\" In reality, Walsh was unable to fulfill his orders to convince Sitting Bull to return to the U.S.. The Canadian government decided that Walsh's friendship with Sitting Bull was an obstacle to the Sioux's return to the United States, and in 1880 he was transferred to Fort Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan. Soon after, he took health leave and returned to Ontario. He reluctantly resigned his commission three years later.\n\nIn August 1897, during the height of the Klondike Gold Rush, Walsh was appointed Commissioner of the newly created Yukon Territory. He resigned soon after in 1898. His successor was William Ogilvie. He died in Brockville, Ontario in 1905.\n\nMount Walsh, a mountain peak in the Saint Elias Mountains in the Yukon is named after him.\n\n"}

The election was a rare five-way race, with incumbent Republican Governor Rick Perry running for re-election against Democrat Chris Bell and Independents Carole Keeton Strayhorn and Kinky Friedman, as well as Libertarian nominee James Werner. Perry was re-elected to a second full term in office, winning 39% of the vote to Bell's 30%, Strayhorn's 18% and Friedman's 12%.\n\nPerry carried 209 out of the state's 254 counties, while Bell carried 39 and Strayhorn carried 6. Exit polls revealed that Perry won the Anglo vote with 46%, while Bell got 22%, Strayhorn got 16% and Friedman got 15%. Bell won 63% of African Americans, while Perry got 16%, Strayhorn got 15% and Friedman got 4%. Bell also won the Latino vote with 41%, while Perry got 31%, Strayhorn got 18% and Friedman got 4%.\n\nPerry was inaugurated for a second full four-year term on January 16, 2007. The ceremony was held inside the House of Representatives chamber at the Texas Capitol after thunderstorms cancelled the planned outdoor ceremony.\n\nIt is difficult for an independent gubernatorial candidate to gain ballot access in the state of Texas. The election law, summarized briefly, requires the following:\n\nIn the event a candidate does not qualify for independent status, they may still run as a write-in candidate. The candidate must pay a $3,750 filing fee and submit 5,000 qualified signatures. However, the filing cannot take place any earlier than July 30, nor later than 5:00 PM on August 29.\n\n\n\nIncumbent Rick Perry became governor in late 2000 when then-Governor George W. Bush resigned following his election as President of the United States. He had been elected lieutenant governor in 1998. Perry was subsequently elected governor in his own right in 2002 and successfully ran for a second full term in 2006.\n\nPerry's overall poll ratings had plummeted since the 2002 election, plagued by budget woes, battles over school financing reform, and a contentious and controversial redistricting battle. His approval rating dropped to 38% during the latter part of the 2005 legislative session. Perry then improved from this position, more recently holding a 44% approval rating, with 51% disapproving, as of a September 2006 poll. Texas election laws do not require a run-off in the event that a majority is not achieved, and so Governor Perry joined only two other Texas governors to achieve the office by a plurality of less than 40%. The Texas Governor Elections of 1853 and 1861 both won with less than 40% of the vote.\n\nDespite weak polling numbers, Perry had the support of the Texas GOP. According to Perry's campaign website, he gained 142 separate endorsements. Perry had endorsements from virtually the entire Texas GOP Congressional delegation (all but two members), every other Republican statewide officeholder (except Strayhorn and judicial officeholders; the latter by law cannot endorse political candidates), 51 of the 62 members of the Texas Republican Party executive committee, and nearly every major Texas pro-business, fiscal conservative, and social conservative organization and PAC. Perry even managed to gain the endorsement of the Teamsters Union, notwithstanding Texas's strong right to work laws.\n\nKinky Friedman, an independent candidate, gained a good amount of popular support among Texas voters. He claimed that country-music lovers, college students, animal lovers, ranchers, and anyone who didn't vote in the last election were among his supporters.\n\nFriedman briefly enjoyed a high standing in the polls, and surpassed Democrat Chris Bell by Independence Day. As Election Day drew near, his campaign fizzled out as much of his wide support was among young voters. He finished fourth in the election with under 13% of the vote. His website claimed that \"he doesn't put much stock in unscientific political polls among \"likely\" voters, saying, \"It's Kinky Friedman versus apathy\". Friedman stated during the campaign that he was going after the 71% who didn't make it to the polls in 2002.\n\nChris Bell, a former Congressman from Houston, filed an ethics complaint against former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay as a lame duck who had been defeated in his party's primary after the controversial mid-decade redistricting in the state. Bell announced his run in July 2005.\n\nBell's official strategy was to get Democrats to unite behind and vote for a Democrat, predicting (and betting on) a splintering of the Republican vote among Perry, Strayhorn, and Friedman, giving the Democrats the needed plurality to win the election. Running on a platform of ethics reform and education issues, he stayed with the pack of three candidates with better name recognition. After a good debate performance, his poll numbers improved significantly to where he had taken second place in nearly every poll afterward.\n\nCarole Keeton Strayhorn, the Comptroller of Public Accounts, was initially pegged as running in a potentially contentious three-way Republican primary battle with bitter rival Governor Perry and U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. Hutchison declined to run for governor in late 2005, instead opting to run for re-election to the Senate. This left Strayhorn and Perry vying for the GOP nomination. Believing her chances to be better running as an independent and appealing directly to voters, rather than those of the Republican Party first, she announced her intent to challenge him in the general election instead. Had she run in the primary, the December 2005 Scripps Howard Texas Poll of match ups had Perry in the lead against Strayhorn by a 55%-24% margin.\n\nStrayhorn was seen as a moderate alternative to Perry, and found support among moderate Republicans and independent voters. Although a few polls had her tied for second going into Election day, she finished with 18.13% of the vote, 12% behind Bell and 21% behind Perry.\n\nJames Werner was the Libertarian Party candidate. According to Werner's campaign website, he has a master's degree in Spanish and Latin American literature from the University of California, a bachelor's degree from Vanderbilt University and is currently working for an Austin-based educational software company.\n\nWerner previously ran for Congress in 2004 as the Libertarian nominee. Contending for the 25th District, he garnered 26,748 votes or 0.61%.\n\nJames \"Patriot\" Dillon was the only announced write-in candidate, according to information from the Texas Secretary of State's office.\n\n\"<nowiki>* denotes polling result winner is within the margin of error</nowiki>\"\n\n\"<nowiki>** denotes data was not reported by the pollster</nowiki>\"\n\n\"Percent change available only for parties that participated in the 2002 Texas gubernatorial election.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1962355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962355", "title": "Edith Woodford-Grimes", "text": "Edith Woodford-Grimes\n\nEdith Rose Woodford-Grimes (1887–1975) was an English Wiccan who achieved recognition as one of the faith's earliest known adherents. She had been a member of the New Forest coven which met during the late 1930s and early 1940s, and through this became a friend and working partner of Gerald Gardner, who would go on to found the Gardnerian tradition with her help. Widely known under the nickname of Dafo, Woodford-Grimes' involvement in the Craft had largely been kept a secret until it was revealed in the late 1990s, and her role in the history of Wicca was subsequently investigated by historians.\n\nThe reason for Woodford-Grimes' adoption of the pseudonym Dafo is unknown, with the researcher Philip Heselton believing that it was not her craft name but a nickname given to her by Gardner, possibly being based upon his experiences in eastern Asia, where it had been used to refer to certain statues of the Buddha.\n\nWoodford-Grimes was born as Edith Rose Wray in a house in Malton, Yorkshire, on 18 December 1887. Her father, William Henry Wray, was an implement maker at the local waterworks, whilst her mother was Caroline Wray, née Harrison. Whilst much is still not known about her early life, she became a teacher, specialising in English, Drama and Music, in later years becoming an associate of the London College of Music and the London Academy of Music.\n\nOn 16 June 1920, she married Samuel William Woodford Grimes, an Englishman who had been born in Bangalore, India in 1880, who at the time was working as a clerk in the War Pensions Office in Southampton. Subsequently, she took his surname of Grimes, and decided to turn it into a double-barrelled surname by adding one of his middle names, Woodford, to it. As researcher Philip Heselton later remarked, \"This may have been pure snobbery, or she may have felt that it sounded more elegant and exclusive – more befitting a teacher of elocution.\" Soon after the marriage, the couple moved to a newly constructed house, 67 Osborne Road, which was found in the Portswood suburb of Southampton in southern England. Then, on 30 June 1921, Edith and Samuel's first and only child, Rosanne, was born, but within a few years Edith returned to work, as by 1924 she had gained employment once more as a tutor in English and Dramatic Literature at various student groups, something she would continue till 1934, and from 1924 she had also begun teaching elocution and dramatic art at evening classes for the Southampton Education Authority.\n\nEventually, the relationship between the couple broke down, and although they remained married (divorce being hard to acquire at the time), they separated. Woodford-Grimes decided to move away from Southampton, and so relocated to Christchurch, Hampshire by 1938. Here she purchased a newly built bungalow in Dennistoun Avenue, Somerford, and began working as a private teacher of elocution and dramatic art. It was at her new home in Christchurch that she became involved in a local esoteric group, the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship. Becoming increasingly interested in their philosophies and practices, she decided to name her bungalow \"Theano\", which had been the name of the wife of the ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras. Woodford-Grimes herself had performed the role of Theano in a play about Pythagoras that the Crotona Fellowship had put on, and which had been written by the group's leader, George Alexander Sullivan.\n\nIt was through the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship that Woodford-Grimes likely met members of another local esoteric group, the New Forest coven, which was one of the earliest recorded Wiccan covens to exist. Its members considered themselves the continuation of the historical Witch-Cult, an ancient religion that the anthropologist Margaret Murray had described in several books published in the 1920s and 1930s. Nonetheless, subsequent investigation and research by historians has disputed that the Witch-Cult had ever existed, and as such it appears that the New Forest coven were in fact a group who had been founded in the early 1930s.\n\nFollowing this marriage, Rosanne and her new husband moved into Woodford-Grimes' bungalow, Theano, whilst she herself relocated once more to Avenue Cottage in Walkford, the village adjacent to Highcliffe, where Gardner and his wife Donna lived.\n\nGardner, discussing the publication of his two books on witchcraft, mentions that he felt obliged to have the permission of the witches he knew to do so. It is now widely assumed that this was a reference to 'Dafo', who appears to have been a great deal more publicity-shy than Gardner was.\n\nIn the late 1940s, Gerald Gardner founded the Bricket Wood coven, and was joined by Dafo. However, she left the coven in 1952, fearing Gardner's growing publicity would expose her.\n\nIn winter 1952 Gardner invited Doreen Valiente, a prospective witch, to meet him and Dafo at her house. They met here on several occasions, and on Midsummer 1953 Gardner initiated Valiente into the craft at Dafo's home. The three of them then set off to Stonehenge, where they watched the Druids performing a ritual there.\n\nBy 1954, Dafo had started living with a strictly Christian niece, who disapproved of occultism and witchcraft. Dafo therefore kept her past involvement with witchcraft secret from her family. In 1958, three separate groups of witches approached her, asking for her to verify Gardner's claims. Dafo did not respond to two of these, and denied having any involvement other than a theoretical interest in the craft to the third.\n\nThe historian Ronald Hutton, in his 1999 book \"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft\", said that he had not researched into Dafo's past, because she would not have wanted such a thing, as most of her family were strict Christians.\n\nWoodford-Grimes has left an enduring legacy in the Wiccan and greater Neopagan community who recognise her as one of the earliest known adherents of her faith. Because she never became publicly known in her lifetime, and the fact that she intentionally denied her involvement in the Craft towards the end of her life, Woodford-Grimes' identity would not be publicly known till several decades after her death. Nonetheless, her involvement in the New Forest coven under her pseudonym of Dafo was known, and was occasionally featured in published sources: one of the earliest of these was in June Johns' 1969 biography of Alex Sanders, \"King of the Witches\", in which she incorrectly spelled the pseudonym as \"Daffo\".\n\nAfter her identity was revealed, she became well known in Wiccan circles, for instance the Neopagan bard Francis Cameron delivered a prose interpretation of her life and involvement with the Craft, written as if from her own point of view, entitled \"Dafo's Tale\", at The Charge of the Goddess conference 2010, held at Conway Hall in London.\n\nNotes\nFootnotes\nBibliography\n"}

The car was used by Rudolf Caracciola to win the 1937 European Championship and W125 drivers also finished in the second, third and fourth positions in the championship.\n\nThe supercharged engine, with 8 cylinders in line (94.0 x 102.mm) and 5,662.85 cc (345.56 CID), attained an output of up to 595 horse power (444 kW) in race trim. The highest test bed power measured was 637 BHP (646 PS) at 5,800 rpm. It gave 245 BHP (248 PS) at a mere 2,000 rpm. In 1938, the engine capacity of supercharged Grand Prix cars was limited to 3000cc, and the W125 was replaced by the Mercedes-Benz W154.\n\nThe W125 was considered the most powerful racing car ever for about 3 decades, until large capacity American-built V8 engines in CanAm sportcars reached similar power in the mid 1960s. In Grand Prix racing itself, the figure was not exceeded until the early 1980s (when Grand Prix racing had become known as Formula One), with the appearance of turbo-charged engines in Formula One.\n\nThe W125 reached race speeds of well over in 1937, especially on the AVUS in Berlin, equipped with a streamlined body.\n\nIn land speed record runs, a Mercedes-Benz W125 Rekordwagen was clocked at over a mile and a kilometre. This car was fitted with a DAB V12 engine (82.0 x 88 mm) of 5,576.75 cc (340.31 CID) with a power of 726 BHP (736 PS) at 5,800 rpm. The weight of this engine caused the car to weigh over the 750 kg maximum limit, so it never appeared in Grand Prix.\n\nDue to the uncompetitiveness of their W25 car, Mercedes pulled out of the 1936 Grand Prix Season midway through the year in order to concentrate on designing a car that would see them return to the top of the rankings. A new racing department ('Rennabteilung') was set up within Mercedes-Benz in order to work on the car. Rudolf Uhlenhaut, previously a production car engineer for the company, was selected to lead the design team in late 1936. Uhlenhaut had not previously designed a racing car, but had significant experience testing road cars on the Nürburgring race track, experience which allowed him to adapt his knowledge relatively easily to racing cars.\n\nWhen testing the old W25 car, Uhlenhaut remarked that the suspension was too stiff, preventing the wheels from following the road. During the test session, a wheel came off the car, yet Uhlenhaut continued to drive the car as if nothing had happened. This stiffness caused the chassis to flex and the rear axle to bend by up to 7–10 cm (3-4 inches) under braking. The brief for the new car included a stiffer chassis and more travel on the suspension to avoid the problems experienced in the 1936 car.\n\nThe W125 had a much stiffer tubular frame construction compared to the previous W25 model. This was achieved using oval tubes made of nickel-chrome molybdenum steel which flexed considerably less than the frame used in the W25.\n\nThe bodywork of the W125 was aluminium metal, which like its predecessor was left unpainted in its bare silver colour. This brought Mercedes' cars during this period (and rivals Auto Union, whose cars were the same colour) the nickname of \"Silver Arrows\", the racing colours of Germany being silver (German racing colours were white but stripped paint to the aluminium metal for weight savings).\n\nWith no regulations limiting engine size, other than the total car weight limit, Mercedes designed a 5.6 litre engine configured with eight inline cylinders and double overhead camshaft for the W125. Named the M125, the engine was also fitted with a Roots type supercharger producing of torque at the start of the season. The engines built varied in power, attaining an output between 560 and 640 horse power (418-444 kW) at 5800 rpm. Fuel used was a custom mix of 40% methyl alcohol, 32% benzene, 24% ethyl alcohol and 4% gasoline light. The engine weighed 222 kg (490 lbs) - approximately 30% of the total weight of the car, and was mounted in the front of the car.\n\nLike its W25 predecessor, the W125 used a 4-speed manual transmission. The gearbox design was changed to a constant mesh type, which provided better reliability compared to the sliding mesh transmission of the M25. In a constant mesh gearbox, the transmission gears are always in mesh and rotating, but the gears are not rigidly connected to the shafts on which they rotate. Instead, the gears can freely rotate or be locked to the shaft on which they are carried. The previous sliding mesh transmission required the gears to be spinning at roughly the same speed when engaged; otherwise, the teeth would refuse to mesh.\n\nThe W125 made its first competitive outing in May at the 1937 Tripoli Grand Prix with Mercedes-Benz entering four cars. German Hermann Lang won his first Grand Prix motor race to give the W125 a victory on its début and provide Mercedes with their first victory over rivals Auto Union since May 1936. The next race was held at the AVUS motor-racing circuit in Germany, a long circuit consisting of two long straights of approximately length joined at either end by a curve. As such, it was possible for a car to reach its top speed. Mercedes entered two W125 cars, a streamliner which was modified from the original design to increase its top speed on the straights and a standard car driven by Richard Seaman in case of problems with the streamliner. The streamliner had a top speed 25 km/h (16 mph) faster than the regular car. On lap three of the race, the streamliner retired while leading due to a gearbox failure. Seaman's regular W125 finished in fifth position.\n\nAt the Eifelrennen held at the Nürburgring circuit, Mercedes entered five W125's, including one driven by Christian Kautz fitted with the new suction carburettor supercharger system. Kautz finished in ninth, while teammates Rudolf Caracciola and Manfred von Brauchitsch finished in second and third places. For the next race, Mercedes split their entries between two races which occurred within a week of another. Two cars were sent to the USA to compete in the Vanderbilt Cup, one of which was fitted with the suction carburettor supercharger used on Kautz's car, and three cars went to Belgium to compete in the first round of the 1937 European Championship. Richard Seaman finished second in the Vanderbilt, and third and fourth place were achieved in the Belgian Grand Prix. Following Seaman's success in the Vanderbilt with the new supercharger system, it was fitted to all of the W125s.\n\nThe following two races were also both part of the European Championship. The next round in Germany saw both Mercedes and rivals Auto Union competing on home soil. Mercedes triumphed, as Rudolf Caracciola took his first victory of the year and Manfred von Brauchitsch followed him home in second position. In the next round at Monaco, the positions were reversed as von Brauchitsch won and Caracciola finished in second. A third Mercedes W125, driven by Christian Kautz, took third place.\n\nThe non-championship Coppa Acerbo in Italy was the next event the W125 entered. During practice Richard Seaman crashed into a house and destroyed his car. Therefore, only von Brauchitsch and Caracciola started the race. During the race, Seaman took over from Caracciola and despite an engine fire, he finished the race fifth. von Brauchitsch fared better finishing in second position. The Swiss Grand Prix was the penultimate round of the 1937 European Championship. Like in Monaco, Mercedes W125s finished in the top three places, Caracciola taking the win with Hermann Lang in second and von Brauchitsch third. The final round of the championship marked a return to Italy, where at the Livorno Circuit, Caracciola held off teammate Lang to win the race by 0.4 seconds and become European Champion. von Brauchitsch retired from the race and took second place overall in the Championship. Kautz and Lang took third and fourth places meaning Mercedes drivers occupied the top four positions in the championship table.\n\nThe W125 entered into two non-championship events before the end of the season. The Masaryk Grand Prix in Czechoslovakia gave the W125 its final victory when Caracciola won the race, von Brauchitsch finished second and Seaman came in third. The race was marred as Hermann Lang had crashed into spectators on lap five, resulting in twelve injuries and two deaths. The final competitive race Mercedes entered the W125 into was the 1937 Donington Grand Prix. Rosemeyer prevailed, von Brauchitsch finished in second place and Caracciola in third while both of the other W125s failed to finish. The British ERA were outclassed, failing to get classified in their home race.\n\n1938 saw changes in the rules, with the maximum limit on weight being replaced with a maximum limit on engine capacity and a minimum weight for the car being introduced; the W125 was no longer eligible for entry without major modification. Instead, Mercedes-Benz developed a new car, the W154, and the W125 was withdrawn from racing.\n\n†Seaman's car was destroyed in practice and did not start. During the race, Seaman took over Caracciola's car and finished fifth.\n\n\n"}

It is situated in the third district just at the edge of the first district in Vienna. Since it was founded it has always tried to emphasise both traditional and innovative musical styles.\n\nIn 1890, the first ideas for a \"Haus für Musikfeste\" (House for music festivals) came about. The idea of the new multi-purpose building was to be more interesting to the broader public than the traditional Vienna Musikverein. In addition to the concert hall, the first drawings by Ludwig Baumann for the \"Olympion\" included an ice-skating area and a bicycle club. In an attached open air area, 40,000 visitors would be able to attend events. Although the drawings were not accepted, today an ice skating area is situated right next to the building.\n\nThe Konzerthaus was finally built between 1911 and 1913. The architects were Fellner & Helmer; the work was done in cooperation with Ludwig Baumann.\n\nThe building is about 70×40 meters and had originally three halls, in which there can be simultaneous concerts, since they are sound-proofed. The original Art Nouveau building was partly destroyed during renovations and adaptions, but the building was reconstructed from original sketches in the 1970s. A historic organ was installed in the Konzerthaus by the Austrian firm Rieger in 1913. Between 1997 and 2000 the house was completely renovated.\n\n\nThe Konzerthaus has the Vienna Symphony, the Vienna Chamber Orchestra, the Wiener Singakademie and the Klangforum Wien in residence. Several subscriptions also include concerts by the Vienna Philharmonic and other organizations.\n\nThe \"Wiener Konzerthausgesellschaft\" also conducts several festivals during the year:\n\n\nThe Historic Concert for the Benefit of Widows and Orphans of Austrian and Hungarian Soldiers was held at the Konzerthaus on January 12, 1918. Its patrons were Kaiser Charles and Empress Zita, with posters designed by Josef Divéky.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1962396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962396", "title": "American Boychoir School", "text": "American Boychoir School\n\nThe American Boychoir School was a boarding/day middle school located in Princeton, New Jersey, and the home of the American Boychoir. The school originated as the Columbus Boychior in Columbus, Ohio. In 1950, the school relocated after receiving property in Princeton, New Jersey from the Lambert estate. The relocated school was renamed the American Boychoir School. It remained in this location until the sale of Albemarle in 2012. The school served boys in grades 4–8, many of whom came from across the United States and from many countries. It was one of only two boychoir boarding schools in the United States, the other being Saint Thomas Choir School in New York City. The school provided opportunity to boys from across the world to experience the rich world of music. The Boychoir toured across the contiguous United States, allowing students to gain diverse cultural perspective while performing at the professional level. The American Boychoir performed with numerous orchestras, frequently including the New York Philharmonic as well as the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra.\n\nIn 2002, the school was embroiled in a scandal due to allegations of sexual abuse of students by faculty and other students. The school served as the basis for a fictionalized choir in the 2014 film \"Boychoir\".\n\nFrom 2012 to 2015, the school's location changed multiple times due to declining admissions and limited funding options as well as poor financial decisions on the part of the administration. In 2015, the school filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and ultimately closed on August 15, 2017.\n\nThe American Boychoir performed in concerts across the United States and at international venues. On average, the choir made over 200 appearances in four to five major tours annually. The choir performed with the New York Philharmonic, the Berlin Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, The St. Olaf Choir, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, and several opera singers including Jessye Norman, Frederica von Stade and Kathleen Battle. The choir had television appearances on NBC's \"Today\" show and was featured on sixteen recordings.\n\nIn the 2004–2005 season, the Boychoir performed at the 77th annual Academy Awards with pop singer Beyoncé Knowles and with Jessye Norman before the United States Open (tennis) women's singles final. The choir also had tours across the United States and Canada, an appearance in Boston and at Carnegie Hall in celebration of James Levine’s inaugural season as Music Director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and six performances with the Philadelphia Orchestra.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2016, the Concert Choir completed several national tours (several to the Midwest and Southern states, California and the Northwest, Texas and the Southwest), and sang at festivals in South Korea and France. The combined Training and Concert Choirs contributed to Tim Janis' \"The American Christmas Carol\" at Carnegie Hall in December, 2015. The Boychoir was featured often by the Philadelphia Orchestra; highlights included \"Carmina Burana\" in October 2013, Bach's \"St. Matthew Passion\" in April 2015, and, most recently Mahler's \"Symphony 8\" in March, 2016.\n\nThe American Boychoir was subdivided into two choirs: the Concert Choir and the Training Choir. The Concert Choir, last conducted by Fernando Malvar-Ruiz, performed and toured regularly while the Training Choir, last conducted by Fred Meads, was made up of first-year students who receive training in order to move up to the Concert Choir when they were ready. Boys joined the choir by auditioning while visiting the school, or auditioning after Boychoir performances at concert sites or after school programs. An alumnus could join the Alumni Chorus, conducted by music director emeritus, James Litton. Auditions were required for enrollment into The American Boychoir School.\n\nThe American Boychoir School was a non-profit, non-sectarian organization. The school did not discriminate in its admissions, scholarship programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national or ethnic origin, gender or religion, and was an accredited member of Middle States Association. Admissions were rolling and boys often joined the student body after the school year had begun.\n\nThe school's educational program was designed to be largely interdisciplinary, with project based learning (PBL) its primary focus. Classes were small (maximum of 12 students) and boys studied in self-contained classrooms with a grade-level teacher who delivered the Language Arts, Social Studies, and Science curricula in interdisciplinary \"modules.\" 4th and 5th grade boys studied together in a class labeled the \"Lower School.\" The goal of all student work was authentic, summative assessment of individual and group achievement, and boys regularly reported on their learning to audiences of their peers, as well as experts in specific fields outside the school.\n\nMathematics instruction at the school was entirely differentiated by student and delivered with mixed methodology which included direct and dedicated Mathematics teacher instruction, textbook interaction, and a web-based Mathematics curriculum (TenMarks) that was supported by a 1:1 iPad program. Each student studied Mathematics independently (with small group instruction when warranted and appropriate) and proceeded according to his own abilities and interests; as a result, within each grade level, boys may have been working below, at, or above-- sometimes far above-- grade level.\n\nAll boys received Latin instruction. The Latin curriculum emphasized grammar and vocabulary that supported parallel Language Arts development, and simple story translation.\n\nAll boys also received Music Theory instruction at one of four levels and all new boys received keyboard training for their first year at the school.\n\nPhysical education classes were held four days per week. All boys participated.\n\nMany graduates of the school went on to the most competitive independent high schools around the country, including Interlochen Arts Academy, Phillips Exeter Academy, Phillips Academy, Lawrenceville School, Peddie School, St. Andrew's School, and Avon Old Farms. About 20-30% of ABS graduates went on to their home public high schools.\n\nThe educational program was integrated with the Boychoir's touring responsibilities throughout the school year. Modules at each grade level were developed to take advantage of the routes the boys followed when they toured. Much effort was made to match the curricula with enrichment activities while on tour, such as visits to museums, historical sites, and environmental areas that illustrated and enhanced what the boys were learning. One teacher traveled with every tour.\n\nThe American Boychoir had two distinct summer music programs: Camp Albemarle and The American Boychoir Experience.\n\nCamp Albemarle provided choruses, a musicianship training program and a small group vocal instruction training program.\n\nThe American Boychoir Experience was for boys ages 9–12 only, and provided the experience of one week in the life of an American Boychoir School student without the academic classes. The week included choral training, music theory, in addition to traditional summer camp activities. This professional experience in choral training culminated in a formal concert. An audition was necessary to participate in The American Boychoir Experience.\n\nThe choir and school were founded in Columbus, Ohio, in 1937, by Herbert Huffman who believed that \"the experience of performing the great choral literature – and performing it at the highest professional levels – could have a profound effect on the academic, social and moral development of boys\". Founded as the Columbus Boychoir, the group moved to Princeton in 1950. It changed its name to the American Boychoir in 1980.\n\nFormer choir directors at the choir school include Herbert Huffman (founder), Donald Bryant, Robert W. Haley, Howard Jewell, Donald G. Hanson, John Kuzma, Jim Litton, Craig Denison, Wallace Hornady and Nathan Wadley. The choir recorded for RCA Victor during Herbert Huffman's tenure before moving to the Decca Label during the Donald Bryant years, where the choir released multiple LP's including one with Bing Crosby. Later, the boychoir would release CDs on its own Albermarle Records label. (see complete Discography below).\n\nFrom 1985 to 2001, the boychoir was conducted by James Litton, an expert on children's choral techniques and vocal production. Regarded as one of America's prominent choral conductors, Litton led the boychoir in more than 2,000 concerts in 49 states and 12 nations. Litton also introduced the changing voice and established SATB sections in the choir. He helped recognize that all boys should continue singing regardless of their voice change.\n\nIn 2012, the choir's longtime home, Albermarle in Princeton, was sold under the presidency of Robert Rund and the choir moved to the Princeton Center for the Arts & Education (formerly St. Joseph's Seminary) for the 2013 and 2014 school years.\n\nOn April 10, 2015, the school filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy stating it needed $350,000 to finish the school year and $3 million to come out of bankruptcy and open for the next academic year. On April 14, 2015, the school announced it would end the school year early, on May 17, instead of reaching the normal time for graduation, the second week of June.\n\nThe school reopened on September 1, 2015, and operated during the 2015-16 school year while working to satisfy its financial obligations and emerge from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy stable and able to move forward successfully. School operations were moved to the campus of Rambling Pines Summer Camp, site of the former Princeton Latin Academy. Rambling Pines provided classroom and office space, gymnasium space, and almost 200 acres of playing fields.\n\nThe American Boychoir School closed on August 15, 2017. [https://planetprinceton.com/2017/08/15/american-boychoir-school-to-close/ [1<nowiki>]</nowiki>]\n\nIn April 2002, \"The New York Times\" reported sexual abuse which had taken place at the Boychoir School several decades earlier by Choir Director Donald G. Hanson and other staff. In court documents, the American Boychoir claimed that it had no duty to protect children in their care from sexual abuse and that children who were abused were themselves negligent for not bringing the abuse to light. One of the students who had claimed that he was victimized was constitutional scholar Lawrence Lessig, who has represented another student, John Hardwicke, in his lawsuit against the school. In its court filings, the school claimed that Hardwicke, then 12, had consented to sex and said that he was negligent in not reporting the incident at the time. Many other boys have now come forward and said they were sexually abused, either by staff members or other older students enrolled at the school. This alleged abuse occurred in the 1970s, 1980s, and into the late 1990s. The school adopted new policies to protect the boys from further sexual abuse, but paid over $850,000 in settlement money to one victim to avoid further lawsuits.\n\nOn August 8, 2006, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled against the school's appeal of a lower court decision. The school had contended that the state's charitable immunity act protected it from liability in sexual abuse lawsuits brought by former students. The court found that the Charitable Immunity Act immunizes charities for negligence only; it does not bar statutory or common-law claims that are based on willful, wanton or grossly negligent conduct.\nThe school's lawyers requested the New Jersey Supreme Court to reconsider the decision, claiming the ruling represented a major extension of vicarious liability. On January 5, 2006, then-Governor of New Jersey Richard Codey signed bill S540/A2512 into New Jersey law, ending the Boychoir's charitable immunity defense, and making New Jersey the 48th state to allow victims of childhood sex abuse to sue churches, schools and other non-profits for the actions of their staff.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1962401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962401", "title": "Australian workplace agreement", "text": "Australian workplace agreement\n\nAn Australian workplace agreement (AWA) was a type of formalised individual agreement negotiated between an employer and employee in Australia that existed from 1996-2009. Employers could offer a \"take it or leave it\" AWA as a condition of employment. They were registered by the Employment Advocate and did not require a dispute resolution procedure. These agreements operated only at the federal level. AWAs were individual written agreements on terms and conditions of employment between an employer and employee in Australia, under the \"Workplace Relations Act 1996\". An AWA could override employment conditions in state or territory laws except those relating to occupational health and safety, workers' compensation, or training arrangements. An AWA was required to meet only the most minimal Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard. Agreements were not required to include effective dispute resolution procedures, and could not include prohibited content. Agreements were for a maximum of five years; approved, promoted and registered by the Workplace Authority; operated to the exclusion of any award; and prohibited industrial action regarding details in the agreement for the life of the agreement. The introduction of AWAs was a very controversial industrial relations issue in Australia.\n\nDuring a Senate Estimates hearing on 29 May 2006, Peter McIlwain, Head of the Office of the Employment Advocate detailed that from a sample of 4 per cent, or 250, of the total 6,263 AWAs lodged during April 2006 after WorkChoices was introduced, that: 100% removed at least one protected Award condition; 64% removed annual leave loadings; 63% stripped out penalty rates; 52% cut out shift loadings; 40% dropped gazetted public holidays; and 16% slashed all award conditions and only the Government's five minimum conditions are satisfied.[6]\n\nNew AWAs were banned under the Fair Work Act 2009.\n\nAs of May 2004, AWAs had achieved coverage of about 2.4% of the workforce. Mining companies pushed the agreements with some success, offering substantial increases in pay to workers who chose to sign an AWA.\n\nAccording to OEA statistics, as of 31 December 2004, 1,410,900 persons were covered under Union Certified Agreements, 168,500 under non-union Certified Agreements, and 421,800, or over 21%, were covered by AWAs. By 31 December 2005 this had risen to 1,618,200 under Union Certified Agreements, 185,300 under non-union Certified Agreements, and 538,200 Australian Workplace Agreements. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures published in March 2005 showed hourly wages of workers on AWAs were two percent lower than the hourly wages of workers on registered collective agreements, mostly negotiated by unions. For women, AWAs paid 11% less per hour than collective agreements.\n\nThe most common methods of setting pay for all employees were registered collective agreement (38.3%), unregistered individual arrangement (31.2%) and award only (20.0%). Unregistered collective agreement (2.6%) and registered individual agreement (2.4%) were the least common methods of setting pay. The remaining 5.4% of employees were working proprietors of incorporated businesses.\n\nIn the federal public service the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations reported that as of 31 December 2004, out of 124,500 public and parliamentary service permanent staff, there were 11,085 AWAs (covering 1928 Senior Executive Service (SES), where AWAs are compulsory, and 9,157 other employees). The rest of the permanent staff were covered, as at 30 March 2005, by 101 certified agreements, of which 70 were union enterprise agreements and 31 non-union enterprise agreements.\n\nAccording to a report in The Australian newspaper in March 2007, about five per cent of the total workforce were at that time employed on AWAs, with about 32 per cent of miners employed on AWAs, but this figure was much higher in Western Australia where up to 52 per cent were on AWAs. Rio Tinto pioneered individual employment contacts under the common law in the 1980s in Western Australia with productivity improvements of between 20 and 35 per cent, according to Rio Tinto managing director Charlie Lenegan.\n\nThe union movement saw AWAs as an attempt to undermine the collective bargaining power of trade unions in the negotiation of pay and conditions of their members. Unions argued that the ordinary working person has little to no bargaining power by themselves to effectively negotiate an agreement with an employer, hence there is inherently unequal bargaining power for the contract. For exceptional individuals in a workplace, or industries with a labor shortage, the union movement argues that common law contracts are sufficient. They also believe that while commercial law and common law provides for fairness and equality of bargaining power, AWAs were designed to entrench inequality between an employer and their workforce with regard to pay and conditions. The policy of the ACTU was that AWAs should be abolished and that the bargaining system should contain collective bargaining rights.\n\nMost unions warned their members to be very cautious about signing AWAs, and if they did so, to appoint the union as their \"bargaining agent\". For example, the Australian Services Union warned members:\n\nAWAs are about one thing: tipping the balance of power more firmly towards your employer and away from you.\n\nIn the Western Australian Parliament in May 2005, the Labor Minister for Consumer and Employment Protection stated his belief that AWAs were being used to reduce wages and conditions of employment in Western Australia.\n\nThe Howard Government and most business groups maintained that AWAs were mutually beneficial for employers and employees, often promoting the view that 'flexibility' is paramount:\n\nAWAs give employers and employees flexibility in setting wages and conditions, and enable them to agree on arrangements that suit their workplaces and individual preferences. AWAs offer an employer and employees the opportunity to make an agreement that best suits the specific needs of individual employees. An existing employee cannot be forced to sign an AWA.\n\nIn April 2007 \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" reported that it had received unpublished Government spreadsheets that showed 27.8% of the agreements had stripped away conditions that were intended to be protected by law. The spreadsheets were based on a sample of AWA agreements.\n\nIn response to ongoing criticisms of WorkChoices and AWAs, then-Prime Minister John Howard announced the introduction of a new \"fairness test\" with an advertising campaign in May 2007 targeting women and youth which did not mention specifically either WorkChoices or AWAs. However, the changes were not retrospective, leaving tens of thousands of workers on contracts that have removed conditions without the compensation that would be required under the current test. Howard stated:\n\nCan I just say that it was never intentional that it should become the norm that penalty rates and overtime loadings should be traded off without proper compensation. The fairness test will guarantee in a very simple way that will not occur.\n\nOn 19 March 2008, a bill was passed in the Senate that prevented new AWAs from being made, and set up provisions for workers to be transferred from AWAs into intermediate agreements.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1962406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962406", "title": "Bill Bowerman", "text": "Bill Bowerman\n\nWilliam Jay \"Bill\" Bowerman (February 19, 1911 – December 24, 1999) was an American track and field coach and co-founder of Nike, Inc. Over his career, he trained 31 Olympic athletes, 51 All-Americans, 12 American record-holders, 22 NCAA champions and 16 sub-4 minute milers. He disliked being called a coach and during his 24 years at the University of Oregon, the Ducks track and field team had a winning season every season but one, attained 4 NCAA titles, and finished in the top 10 in the nation 16 times. As co-founder of Nike, he invented some of their top brands, including the \"Cortez\" and \"Waffle Racer\", and assisted in the company moving from being a distributor of other shoe brands to one creating their own shoes in house.\n\nBill Bowerman was born in Portland, Oregon. His father was former Governor of Oregon Jay Bowerman; his mother had grown up in Fossil. The family returned to Fossil after the parents divorced in 1913. Bowerman had an older brother and sister, Dan and Mary Elizabeth \"Beth\"; and a twin brother, Thomas, who died in an elevator accident when he was 2 years old.\n\nBowerman attended Medford and Seattle schools before returning to Medford for high school. He played in the high school band and for the state champion football team his junior and senior years. Bowerman first met Barbara Young, the woman he would marry, while a high school student in Medford.\n\nIn 1929, Bowerman attended the University of Oregon to play football and study journalism. At the suggestion of longtime track coach Bill Hayward, he also joined the track team. He was a member of Beta Theta Pi Fraternity. After graduating he taught biology and coached football at Franklin High School in Portland in 1934. In 1935, Bowerman moved back to Medford to teach and coach football during which won a state title in 1940.\n\nBowerman married Barbara Young on June 22, 1936. Their first son, Jon, was born June 22, 1938. William J. Bowerman, Jr. (\"Jay\") was born November 17, 1942.\n\nBowerman had been in the ROTC and Army Reserve, and then joined the United States Army as a 2nd Lieutenant in the days following the Pearl Harbor attack. He was assigned to Fort Lawton in Washington and served a year there before being assigned to the 86th Mountain Infantry Regiment at Camp Hale in Leadville, Colorado. Along with the 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment, his regiment would become the 10th Mountain Division.\n\nBowerman's duty entailed organizing the troops' supplies and maintaining the mules used to carry the supplies in the mountains. On December 23, 1944, the division arrived in Naples, Italy and soon moved north to the mountains of northern Italy. During his tour of duty, Bowerman was promoted to commander of the 86th Regiment's First Battalion at the rank of Major. Bowerman negotiated a stand-down of German forces near the Brenner Pass in the days before the surrender of the German army in all of Italy. For his service, Bowerman received the Silver Star and four Bronze Stars. He was honorably discharged in October 1945.\n\nAfter the war, Bowerman returned to his position at Medford High School. Bowerman's third son, Tom, was born May 20, 1946. The family then moved to Eugene where he became the head track coach at his alma mater, the University of Oregon, on July 1, 1948.\n\nBowerman's \"Men of Oregon\" won 24 NCAA individual titles (with wins in 15 of the 19 events contested) and four NCAA team crowns (1962-1964-1965-1970), and posted 16 top-10 NCAA finishes in 24 years as head coach. His teams also boasted 33 Olympians, 38 conference champions and 64 All-Americans. At the dual level, the Ducks posted a 114–20 record and went undefeated in 10 seasons. In addition, Bowerman coached the world record setting relay team in 1962. This team consisted of Archie San Romani, Dyrol Burleson, Vic Reeve, and Keith Forman with a time of 16:08.9. Six years later, another Oregon team of Roscoe Divine, Wade Bell, Arne Kvalheim and Dave Wilborn improved the record to 16:05.0. Among athletes that Bowerman coached are: Otis Davis, Steve Prefontaine, Kenny Moore, Bill Dellinger, Mac Wilkins, Jack Hutchins, Dyrol Burleson, Harry Jerome, Sig Ohlemann, Les Tipton, Gerry Moro, Wade Bell, Dave Edstrom, Roscoe Divine, Matt Centrowitz, Arne Kvalheim, Jim Grelle, Bruce Mortenson and Phil Knight.\n\nBowerman disliked being called a coach; he saw himself as more of a teacher. He expected his squad to excel in the classroom, and urged his charges to apply the lessons they learned on the track to everyday life. \n\nIn 1972, Bowerman stepped back from day-to-day coaching activities to conduct fundraising for renovating the Hayward Field grandstands that would be necessary for the consideration of hosting the Montreal Olympic Trials. He also ran unsuccessfully for a House seat in the Oregon Legislature in 1970 as a Republican, losing by only 815 votes out of 61,000 cast. According to the Eugene \"Register-Guard\" newspaper, Bowerman officially retired as the University of Oregon head coach on March 23, 1973, and was succeeded by assistant coach Bill Dellinger.\n\nBowerman created a training program for adjusting athletes for the high altitude that they would experience at the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games. This successful program led to his selection as the 1972 Munich Olympic Track and Field head coaching position, even though American miler favorite Jim Ryan lost to Kenyan Kip Keno citing attitude as part of the reason for this upset Bowerman coached members of teams from Norway, Canada, Australia, and the United States.\n\nDuring the Munich Massacre in the 1972 Munich Olympics, where Bowerman was frequently blamed for a dismal performance by the US Track Team, Israeli Olympic racewalker Shaul Ladany escaped the PLO terrorists, and then awakened Bowerman and alerted the German police. Bowerman called for the U.S. Marines to come and protect American Olympians swimmer Mark Spitz and javelin thrower Bill Schmidt.\n\nDuring a trip to New Zealand in 1962, Bowerman was introduced to the concept of running as a fitness routine, including people of an advanced age, through a running club organized by his friend and coaching colleague Arthur Lydiard. Bowerman brought this concept back to the United States, and began to write articles and books about running. He also created a running program in Eugene that became a national model for fitness programs. \"A Jogger's Manual\", a three-page guide, was published shortly after Bowerman returned from New Zealand. In 1966, along with cardiologist W.E. Harris, Bowerman published a 90-page book titled \"Jogging\". The book sold over a million copies and was credited with igniting the jogging phenomenon in the United States. The new crop of older athletic people contributed to the evolution of the sport of track and field to create a new division for these masters athletes. Due to the popularity of \"Jogging\", Harris and Bowerman published a 127-page book in 1967.\n\nAthletics West is an American running team formed by Bill Bowerman, Phil Knight and Geoff Hollister in 1977. At the time, America had no definitive running program for young athletes to continue competing outside of college. The formation and success of Athletics West, together with the success and popularity of American runners like Craig Virgin (charter member), Steve Prefontaine, Frank Shorter and Bill Rodgers helped inspire the 1970s running boom.\n\nAccording to Otis Davis, a student athlete who Bowerman coached at the University of Oregon, who later went on to win two gold medals at the 1960 Summer Olympics, Bowerman made the first pair of Nike shoes for him, contradicting a claim that they were made for Phil Knight. Says Davis, \"I told Tom Brokaw that I was the first. I don't care what all the billionaires say. Bill Bowerman made the first pair of shoes for me. People don't believe me. In fact, I didn't like the way they felt on my feet. There was no support and they were too tight. But I saw Bowerman make them from the waffle iron, and they were mine.\"\n\nIn 1964, Bowerman entered into a handshake agreement with Phil Knight, who had been a miler under him in the 1950s, to start an athletic footwear distribution company called Blue Ribbon Sports, later known as Nike, Inc. Knight managed the business end of the partnership, while Bowerman experimented with improvements in athletic footwear design. Bowerman stayed in Eugene, keeping his coaching job at the University of Oregon, while Knight operated the main office from Portland. Bowerman and Knight initially began importing the Onitsuka Tiger running shoes from Japan to sell in the United States. Initially, the partnership was 50-50, but shortly afterwards Bowerman wanted it changed to 51-49, with Knight having the higher ownership. He did this to avoid potential gridlock and have one of them be in charge of final decisions.\n\nBowerman's design ideas led to the creation of a running shoe in 1966 that would ultimately be named \"Nike Cortez\" in 1968, which quickly became a top-seller and remains one of Nike's most iconic footwear designs. Bowerman designed several Nike shoes, but is best known for ruining his wife's Belgian waffle iron in 1970 or 1971, experimenting with the idea of using waffle-ironed rubber to create a new sole for footwear that would grip but be lightweight.\nBowerman's design inspiration led to the introduction of the so-called \"Moon Shoe\" in 1972, so named because the waffle tread was said to resemble the footprints left by astronauts on the moon. Further refinement resulted in the \"Waffle Trainer\" in 1974, which helped fuel the explosive growth of Blue Ribbon Sports/Nike. While Bowerman was experimenting with shoe design, he worked in a small, unventilated space, using glue and solvents with toxic components that caused him severe nerve damage. The nerve damage to his lower legs left him with significant mobility problems; as Kenny Moore notes in his book \"Bowerman and the Men of Oregon\", Bowerman had rendered himself unable to run in the shoes that he had given the world.\n\nBowerman was obsessed with shaving weight off his athletes' running shoes. He believed that custom-made shoes would weigh less on the feet of his runners and cut down on blisters, as well as reduce the overall drag on their energy for every ounce he could remove from the shoe. By his estimation, removing one ounce (28 g) from a shoe, based on a six-foot gait for a runner, would translate in a reduction of 55 pounds (25 kg) of lift over a one-mile (1.6 km) span.\n\nKnight once said of Bowerman's importance to the company, \"If coach (Bowerman) isn't happy, Nike isn't happy.\"\n\nBowerman reduced his role with the company in the late 1970s and began passing down his stake in the company to other employees shortly before the IPO launched.\n\nBowerman is a member of the National Distance Running Hall of Fame, the USA National Track and Field Hall of Fame, the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame, Oregon's Athletic Hall of Fame, the RRCA Distance Running Hall of Fame, and the National Inventors Hall of Fame. His statue, holding a stopwatch, graces the northwest corner of Hayward Field, home of the Prefontaine Classic at the University of Oregon. A biographical film, \"Without Limits\", about the relationship between record-breaking distance runner Steve Prefontaine and his coach Bill Bowerman was made in 1998, and Bill Bowerman was played by Donald Sutherland. The headquarters for Nike is located on Bowerman Drive in homage to the company's co-founder. Also in his honor, the company created the \"Bowerman Series\" of performance running shoes, designed to provide longer-lasting, more training-focused products to compete with such running brands as Asics and Saucony.\n\nIn 2009, the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association created The Bowerman, an award that is given to the most outstanding collegiate male and female track & field athlete in a given calendar year. Inaugural winners of the award were Oregon's Galen Rupp and Colorado's Jenny Barringer. The Bowerman trophy was designed by Tinker Hatfield, a Nike employee and former Oregon student-athlete coached by Bowerman.\n\nBowerman died in his home in Fossil, Oregon at the age of 88 on Christmas Eve 1999.\n\n\nBook: Bowerman and the Men of Oregon by Kenny Moore\n\n\n"}
