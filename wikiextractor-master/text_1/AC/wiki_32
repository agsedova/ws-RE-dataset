Landis at first appeared to be the winner of the 2006 Tour de France, and the third non-European winner in the event's history, before testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs. The competition was ultimately won by Óscar Pereiro. Landis was an all-around rider, with special skills in climbing, time-trialing, and descending. Landis turned professional in 1999 with the Mercury Cycling Team. He joined the U.S. Postal Service team in 2002, and moved to the Phonak Hearing Systems team in 2005. In January 2010, a French judge issued a national arrest warrant for Landis on computer hacking charges related to the 2006 doping allegations.\n\nUntil 2010, Landis maintained his innocence and mounted a defense. Although Landis's legal team documented inconsistencies in the handling and evaluation of his urine samples, the disqualification was upheld. He was suspended from professional competition through January 30, 2009, following an arbitration panel's 2-to-1 ruling on September 20, 2007. Landis appealed the result of the arbitration hearing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which subsequently upheld the panel's ruling. In January 2011, Landis was unable to find a new team, which effectively ended his professional career. On May 20, 2010, after almost four years of contesting the allegations, Landis admitted to continual doping, and revealed that Lance Armstrong and many other top riders who rode on his team doped as well.\n\nFloyd Landis is the second child and oldest son of Paul and Arlene Landis. His childhood home is in the village of Farmersville in West Earl Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Conestoga Valley High School in Lancaster, Pennsylvania in 1994. He was raised in a devout Mennonite family and community. Landis used his first bike to ride while out fishing with his best friend but quickly learned to enjoy riding for its own sake. At one point, he became determined to ride in a local race. Landis showed up wearing sweatpants because his religion forbade wearing shorts. He won that race, and more wins followed as Landis continued to enjoy the sport.\n\nDisturbed at his son's participation in what he considered a \"useless\" endeavor, Landis's father tried to discourage him from racing his bike by giving him extra chores. This left him no time to train during the day, so he would sneak out of the house at night to train, sometimes at 1 or 2 a.m. and often in the freezing cold. Landis's father received a tip that his son had been going out at night. He did not appreciate his son's passion for cycling and thought he might be getting into drugs or alcohol. He often followed Landis at a distance to make sure he was not getting into trouble. Landis' father later became a hearty supporter of his son and considered himself one of Floyd's biggest fans.\n\nLandis won the first mountain bike race he entered. In 1993, he was crowned U.S. junior national champion. He told friends he would win the Tour de France one day. At age 20, Landis moved to Southern California to train full-time as a mountain biker. He soon established a reputation for toughness, once finishing a race riding on only his rims. However, his training regimen resembled that of a road biker, and in 1999 he switched to road cycling.\n\nLandis performed well enough on the road that Lance Armstrong recruited him to U.S. Postal and chose Landis to ride alongside him as a domestique during his Tour wins from 2002 to 2004, part of his then-record seven Tour titles. In each of these Tours, Landis served as Armstrong's lieutenant, or chief domestique, pushing the pace in the mountains to break the pack before Armstrong took off on his own to win the stage. In the 2004 tour, Landis led Armstrong and a few of Armstrong's main rivals over the final climb of stage 17, putting on such an impressive display of strength that actor and avid bike-racing fan Robin Williams dubbed him the \"Mofo of the Mountains\". Landis' performance led some observers to peg him as a possible team leader and future winner of the Maillot Jaune. Landis left U.S. Postal later that year after receiving a better contract offer from the Phonak squad.\n\nIn the 2005 Tour de France, Landis finished ninth overall in the General classification, his highest finish in the tour at that time. Landis started the 2006 season strongly, with overall wins in the Amgen Tour of California, and then in the prestigious Paris–Nice, both week-long stage races. Winning Paris–Nice gave Landis 52 points in the UCI ProTour individual competition, starting him off in first place for 2006. Landis continued his display of strength with another overall win in the Ford Tour de Georgia, which took place from April 18 to April 23. In addition to winning the Tour de Georgia time trial, Landis managed to retain every second of his lead through the mountains with a close second-place finish to Tom Danielson on Brasstown Bald, the most difficult climbing stage of the tour.\n\nThe powerful performance of Landis up to stage 16 of the Tour de France and his comeback in stage 17 is particularly notable given his hip ailment, osteonecrosis, which was revealed in an article in \"The New York Times\" during the 2006 Tour de France. This deterioration in the ball joint of his right hip stemmed from diminished blood supply and constricted blood vessels caused by scar tissue. The original injury that led to the formation of the scar tissue was a femoral neck fracture sustained in a bicycle crash during a training ride near his Southern California home in October 2002. Landis kept the ailment secret from his teammates, rivals, and the media until an announcement was made while the 2006 Tour was underway. This same ailment also affected former multi-sport athlete Bo Jackson and American football player Brett Favre.\n\nLandis rode the 2006 Tour with the constant pain from the injury, which he described: \"It's bad, it's grinding, it's bone rubbing on bone. Sometimes it's a sharp pain. When I pedal and walk, it comes and goes, but mostly it's an ache, like an arthritis pain. It aches down my leg into my knee. The morning is the best time, it doesn't hurt too much. But when I walk it hurts, when I ride it hurts. Most of the time it doesn't keep me awake, but there are nights that it does.\" During the Tour, Landis was medically approved to take cortisone for this injury, a medication otherwise prohibited in professional cycling for its known potential for abuse. Landis himself called his first place in the General Classification \"a triumph of persistence\" despite the pain. He was stripped of his win on September 20, 2006.\n\nLandis underwent successful hip replacement on September 27, 2006, receiving a Smith and Nephew Birmingham metal-on-metal hip joint.\n\nOn July 27, 2006, the Phonak Cycling Team announced a urine sample submitted by Floyd Landis tested positive for an unusually high ratio of the hormone testosterone to the hormone epitestosterone (T/E ratio) after his performance in stage 17 of the 2006 Tour de France. Landis denied doping and placed faith in a test using his backup sample. Phonak stated that he would be dismissed should the backup sample also test positive. It did, and Landis was suspended from professional cycling and dismissed from his team. Landis's personal physician later disclosed that the test had found a T/E ratio of 11:1 in Landis, far above the maximum allowable ratio of 4:1.\n\nThe test on Landis's stage 17 A sample had been performed by the French government's anti-doping clinical laboratory, the National Laboratory for Doping Detection (LNDD). LNDD is a division of the Ministry of Youth, Sport, and Social Life and is accredited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). In early August, Landis was found guilty of doping and was disqualified. Second place rider Óscar Pereiro became the race's official winner. The decision of whether to strip Landis of his title was made by the International Cycling Union (UCI). Under UCI rules, the determination of whether a cyclist violated any rules must be made by the cyclist's national federation, in this case USA Cycling, which transferred the case to the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA).\n\nDavid Witt, a close personal friend who introduced Landis to his future wife (the daughter of Witt's then girlfriend and future wife), shot himself with a handgun in the North Park community of San Diego on August 15, 2006. Landis and Witt met as roommates in 1998 when Landis moved to San Diego. Witt and Landis shared the same cycling coach, and Witt was instrumental in Landis' transition from mountain biking to road bicycle racing. Witt and his wife attended the 2006 Tour de France and were in Paris with Landis to celebrate his victory. Witt's North Park restaurant was adorned with Landis memorabilia, including two of Landis' jerseys. The San Diego Union-Tribune reported that a Landis family spokesman read the following from a statement: \"Floyd, Amber and the family are devastated by the news of David's death. They loved him dearly, and they miss him. [The Landises] hope their privacy is respected in this time of mourning.\" Many years later, Landis claimed that Witt may have killed himself because of his knowledge of Landis' doping practices. In a 2010 ESPN interview, Landis acknowledged that Witt knew about Landis' doping and said, \"I'm not saying that's the reason he's dead, but without that, I don't see why he wouldn't still be here.\" Even before the USADA's ruling on the matter, the controversy resulted in the disbandment of Landis's former team \"Phonak\".\n\nOn September 20, 2007, Landis was found guilty of doping by a 2–1 vote of the hearing committee, with Patrice Brunet and Richard McLaren in the majority, and Christopher Campbell dissenting. Landis was banned from the sport for two years, dated retroactively to January 2007. Landis appealed the decision of the committee to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The hearing ran from March 19 to March 24, 2008 in New York City. The decision was announced on June 30, 2008, with the result that the conviction and ban were upheld. In September 2008, Landis moved in U.S. federal court to vacate the CAS arbitration award, contending that the procurement of the award was tainted by partiality and conflicts of interest. Landis contested the $100,000 U.S. \"costs\" award, characterizing it as a disguised punitive award. The parties agreed to dismiss the case with prejudice in December 2008, ending the litigation surrounding the doping case.\n\nOn April 14, 2009, the French newspaper \"L'Express\" reported information that had been obtained from hacking into the French national laboratory for doping detection. The information was sent to a Canadian counterpart lab from a computer registered to Arnie Baker, Landis's ex-coach. On August 25, 2009, \"The New York Times\" reported, \"No evidence has surfaced to connect Mr. Landis or Dr. Baker to the hacking, and each has denied any involvement.\" However, on February 15, 2010, it became known that a French judge issued an arrest warrant for Landis on the hacking charge in late January.\n\nDuring 2006 and 2007, Landis is believed to have raised about $1 million from the \"Floyd Fairness Fund\", established by businessman Thom Weisel. He appealed to supporters to donate \"anything they could\" to help him pay his reportedly $2 million legal bill, while denying his involvement in doping. Landis reached an agreement with federal prosecutors over allegations that he fraudulently solicited donations for a defense fund he set up to fight doping charges. He appeared before a federal judge on August 24, 2012 for a \"deferred prosecution\" hearing at which he agreed to pay restitution.\n\nAfter his two-year ban ended in early 2009, Landis returned to cycling with the OUCH Pro Cycling Team, a U.S. team that races domestically. His first race following his suspension and his first race as a member of the OUCH team was the 2009 Tour of California, in which he finished 23rd out of a field of 84 riders. Landis left the OUCH team at the end of 2009, stating he wished to ride the longer, tougher stage races offered in Europe and internationally that better suit his strengths. He then raced the Tour of Southland in New Zealand in November 2009, with local team CyclingNZshop.com-Bio Sport, finishing 17th overall out of a field of 95 riders. For the 2010 season, he joined the Bahati Foundation Cycling Team. However, after Landis admitted to doping himself and accused many other prominent American cyclists of doping, the Bahati Team began to fall apart, and Landis competed in the July 2010, Cascade Cycling Classic in Bend, Oregon as a lone rider without a team.\nLandis was unable to find a team in the next months, and in January 2011, decided to end his career.\n\nOn May 20, 2010, midway through the 2010 Amgen Tour of California, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that Floyd Landis had sent a series of emails to senior cycling and anti-doping officials in which he admitted to doping from June 2002 through his victory in the 2006 Tour de France. It was also reported that Landis and his coach Dr. Brent Kay sent emails to Tour of California director Andrew Messick. Landis had asked Messick to be allowed last-minute entry to the 2010 race; when Messick refused, Landis released his allegations regarding cycling to the media. He accused several former teammates, including Lance Armstrong and George Hincapie, of using EPO and blood transfusions in the 2002 and 2003 seasons. Landis also claims there was blood doping at the 2004 Tour de France.\n\nArmstrong and Team RadioShack maintained that Landis and his coach had asked for a spot on , and Landis only went public with the allegations after being denied a contract. Landis also alleged that he assisted Levi Leipheimer and Dave Zabriskie in taking EPO before the Tour of California one year. In an \"ESPN\" interview that day, Landis steadfastly denied that he had used synthetic testosterone during the 2006 Tour de France, but admitted to using human growth hormone and other doping modalities. The 2006 Tour de France was the only race to produce evidence Landis had ever used banned substances. Landis admitted that he had no physical evidence to support his allegations of others' involvement in doping, but that his emails were intended to \"clear his conscience.\"\n\nLandis stated that Armstrong told him in 2002 that U.S. Postal Service Pro Cycling Team director Johan Bruyneel had made a \"financial arrangement\" with the International Cycling Union (UCI) to ensure that details of a positive test on Armstrong remained confidential. Pat McQuaid, the president of UCI, who had received copies of Landis' emails, said that Landis' allegations were \"completely untrue\", that Landis was \"seeking revenge,\" and that UCI had \"made contact with a lawyer and will take appropriate action.\"\n\nBruyneel \"absolutely den[ied] everything [Landis] said\" and noted that several people \"have had the story for a few weeks but didn't give it any credibility\" and that Landis was \"angry at the world\" for the collapse of his career following his conviction. Olympic medalist Steve Hegg said he felt \"betrayed\" and \"deceived\" and characterized Landis as \"a bitter guy.\" David Millar, who served a two-year suspension for EPO doping from 2004 to 2006 and is on the team, said: \"If [Landis] had stood up and manned up four years ago, he'd be racing the Tour de France now. He'd have a different book out. He'd have not lost a penny. He'd be admired by young people. He would have a different life ahead of him...\" Both the World Anti-Doping Agency and the U.S. government began investigating Landis' accusations. The U.S. case investigation was led by Jeff Novitzky, a special agent with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and Doug Miller, an experienced federal prosecutor, both of whom were part of the BALCO investigative team.\n\nLandis filed a federal whistleblower lawsuit against Armstrong under the federal False Claims Act, where he alleged that Armstrong and team managers defrauded the U.S. government when they accepted money from the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). In February 2013, the United States Department of Justice joined the whistleblower lawsuit, which also accused former USPS team director Johan Bruyneel and Tailwind Sports, the firm that managed the USPS team, of defrauding the U.S. In February 2017, the court determined that the federal government’s 100 million civil lawsuit against Armstrong, started by Landis, would proceed to trial. The matter was settled in April 2018 when Armstrong agreed to pay the United States Government 5 million. It was reported that Landis would receive 1.1 million as a result of his whistleblower actions.\n\nIn July 2011, Landis gave an interview to Graham Bensinger in which he described his plans and training to race professionally in NASCAR.\n\nIn November 2011, Landis and his former coach Arnie Baker, were convicted of \"benefiting from\" hacking into the computers of the Chatenay-Malabry anti-doping lab. Both received 12-month suspended sentences. As of March 2012, Landis was appealing his conviction. In April 2012, it was revealed that Landis was under investigation by federal prosecutors in connection with possible wire and mail fraud committed when he raised his legal defense fund in 2007. In August 2012, Landis admitted to fraud, and was ordered to pay 487,000 in restitution. He reached a deal to avoid being prosecuted for the fraud charges as long as he paid the restitution.\n\nLandis is portrayed by American actor Jesse Plemons in the 2015 film \"The Program\", directed by Stephen Frears and starring Ben Foster as Lance Armstrong and Chris O'Dowd as David Walsh.\n\nHe opened a cannabis company in Colorado in mid-2016.\n\nLandis' 2006 Tour de France attack gained new attention at the 2018 Giro d'Italia, when Chris Froome's race-clinching long-range solo breakaway on Stage 19 of the 2018 Giro d'Italia was described by fellow rider George Bennett immediately after the stage as “doing a Landis”.\n\nIn October 2018 Landis announced that he would launch a new UCI Continental cycling team sponsored by his cannabis business, Floyd's of Leadville. He indicated that funding for the team would come from the bulk of the money he received from the settlement of the Lance Armstrong whistleblower lawsuit, and that it would be managed by Gord Fraser. In November 2019 Landis announced the team would be folding after one year of operation.\n\n\nDid not finish = DNF; Voided results = <del>struck through</del>.\n\n\n"}

Conception Bay is adjacent to the St. John's Metropolitan Area which contains 5 of the 10 largest settlements in the province and is home to over 200,000 people.\n\nThe smaller communities in Newfoundland may often be referenced by the Bay in which they are located, e.g.: 'Port de Grave, CB'.\n\nThe bay indents the Avalon Peninsula, opening towards the Atlantic Ocean at its northeast. It is bounded by Cape St. Francis in the south and Split Point near Bay de Verde in the north. It has a maximum depth of 300 metres (980 ft).\n\nConception Bay covers an area of 1295 square kilometres and contains several islands, the three largest being Bell Island, Little Bell Island and Kellys Island. The Bay is fed by rivers from its east and west, which flow on into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe name Conception Bay comes from the Portuguese \"Baía da Conceição\" or \"Baia de Comceica\" and was presumably given in honour of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, December 8. The name first appears on the Oliveriana (Pesaro) map of around 1504–1505.\n\nConception Bay was the site of Britaniola Colony, established in 1610. It was the site of Sea-Forest Plantation founded in 1610 and Bristol's Hope Plantation founded in 1619. During the 1610s, the Bay was the hideout of the infamous Newfoundland based buccaneer, Peter Easton. Artifacts from the 17th-century planter era through the 19th century have been found, such as Spanish coins, one minted in Peru. There was trade between Newfoundland and Bilbao during the 17th century.\n\nFrom the late 1890s to the 1960s, Bell Island was home to an iron ore mine in Wabana, operated most recently by the Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation (DOSCO). The ore was shipped for processing to DOSCO's steel mill in Sydney, Nova Scotia.\n\nDuring World War II, anchored DOSCO cargo ships, along with the loading pier at Wabana, were the target of Nazi U-boats on at least two occasions. During one attack on anchored ore carriers, a torpedo missed its target and struck the pier, making Bell Island one of the few places in North America to suffer a direct enemy attack (see Attacks on North America during World War II). The wrecks of the four cargo ships sunk during these two attacks are visible at low tide; a memorial on shore is dedicated to the 69 merchant sailors who lost their lives.\n\nSince 2011 Memorial University of Newfoundland has been conducting archaeological excavations at Carbonear bordering the bay.\n\nThe provincial government operates a passenger-vehicle ferry service from Bell Island to Portugal Cove (on the bay's southeastern shore), operating through what locals know as the \"Bell Island Tickle.\"\n\nHumpback whales have been known to enter the bay while migrating. Private vessels and tourist charters frequent the bay's waters during the summer months.\n\nProperty development in the St. John's exurb of Conception Bay South in recent decades has led to increasing recreational use of the bay.\n\n"}

The four sons of the former king Canute I fell out with King Sverker II in about 1204 and sought support among the Birkebeiner party in Norway. The Birkebeiner leader Jarl Håkon Galen married their cousin in January 1205 and promoted their claim. The brothers, of whom only Eric Knutsson is known by name, returned to Sweden in the same year. To which extent they had Norwegian military backing is unclear. \n\nBy the fall of 1205 the brothers were staying at the estate of Älgarås when the Sverker clan attacked.

The electrical wiring becomes a backup transmission medium in the event of RF/wireless interference. Conversely, RF/wireless becomes a backup transmission medium in the event of powerline interference. As a peer-to-peer network, devices do not require network supervision, thus allowing optional operation without central controllers and routing tables.\n\nInsteon devices can function without a central controller. Additionally, they may be managed by a central controller to implement functions such as control via smartphones and tablets, control scheduling, event handling, and problem reporting via email or text messaging. A computer can be used as a central controller by connecting it to an Insteon USB/serial PowerLinc modem, which serves as a communication bridge between the computer and the Insteon device network.\n\nInsteon network security is maintained via \"linking control\" to ensure that users cannot create links that would allow them to control a neighbors’ Insteon devices, and via encryption within extended Insteon messages for applications such as door locks and security applications, should those applications choose to implement encryption.\n\nInsteon enforces linking control by requiring users to have physical possession of devices, or knowledge of their unique Insteon IDs in order to create links. Firmware in Insteon devices prohibits them from identifying themselves to other devices unless a user either physically presses a button on the device during the installation process or explicitly addresses the device via a central controller. Linking to a device by sending Insteon messages (e.g., from a central controller) requires knowledge of the address of the target Insteon device. As these addresses are unique for each device and assigned at the factory (and displayed on a printed label attached to each device), users must have physical access to the device to read the device address from the label and manually enter it when prompted during installation.\n\nThe security of Insteon RF devices was criticized in a DEF CON presentation in 2015.\n\nInsteon devices are configured by applying a sequence of \"taps\" (button presses) to a pushbutton on each device to establish direct device-to-device links. Alternatively, a central controller may be used to configure devices.\n\nEach Insteon device has its own unique identifier code, similar to a MAC address, and the technology allows directly linked devices to manage their identifiers.\n\nOlder Insteon chip sets manufactured by Smartlabs can transmit, receive, and respond to (but not repeat) X10 power line messages, thus enabling X10 networks to interoperate with Insteon.\n\nIn 2014, Insteon released a home automation system compatible with the touch-enabled Metro interface, with devices appearing as \"live tiles\", and later added voice control via Microsoft Cortana.\n\nIn 2015, voice control was added via compatibility with Amazon Echo. That same year, Logitech announced the Harmony Hub-based remote would support Insteon devices when deployed with an Insteon Hub. Also in 2015, Insteon announced an initiative to integrate the Google-owned Nest learning thermostat with the Insteon Hub.\n\nInsteon was one of two launch partners for Apple's HomeKit platform, with the HomeKit-enabled Insteon Hub Pro. In 2015, Insteon announced support for the Apple Watch, allowing watch owners to control their home with an Insteon Hub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsteon second generation i2/RF replaces first generation i1/RF for wireless Insteon communications. i1/RF and i2/RF uses different frequencies and can operate independently. There currently is only one legacy product that implements i1/RF (SignaLinc RF signal enhances introduced in May 2005). The specifications below are for i2/RF.\n\n\n"}

He raced as an amateur in Europe from 1973, after joining the ACBB club in the Parisian suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt. The club frequently provided riders for the Peugeot professional team, which had had English-speaking riders since the Briton, Tom Simpson, led it in the 1960s. Boyer, however, turned professional in 1977 for the smaller Lejeune-BP team, sponsored by a Parisian cycle company and an international oil giant. He first competed in the Tour in 1981, when the organiser, Félix Lévitan, encouraged him to wear not his team jersey but a Stars and Stripes design which suggested that he was the American national champion. Many have said that Lévitan, who looked after the financial aspects of the race while his colleague Jacques Goddet managed the sporting side, saw Boyer as a way to attract further American interest and money.\n\nBoyer rode the Tour de France five times and finished 12th in 1983 (French Jean de Gribaldy Sem team with Sean Kelly). He was unusual in refusing to eat meat and became well known for the large quantities of nuts and fruit that he brought to the race. The French team manager, Cyrille Guimard, described Boyer as \"un marginal\", a description hard to translate but which suggests an outsider, almost a hippie.\n\nThe British journalist Dennis Donovan, working for the London magazine \"Cycling\" remarked on Boyer's intense religious beliefs. In the 1981 Tour, he said, English-speaking journalists felt sorry for him as a colleague in a French-speaking world and offered him a collection of girlie magazines. Boyer, said Donovan, declined politely and said he preferred to read his Bible.\n\nBoyer also competed in and won the 1980 Coors Classic in the USA, and the 1985 Race Across America completing the 3,120 miles in nine days, two hours, and six minutes. His career included 87 amateur victories and 49 professional ones.\n\nBoyer was inducted into the United States Cycling Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nIn November, 2002, Boyer was convicted after pleading guilty to 10 felony counts of child molestation. He was sentenced to 20 year prison term which was suspended by the judge and had him serve one year in jail and five years probation. In January, 2006, after successful completion of his probation conditions, his probation officer recommended that Boyer be released from probation.\n\nIn 2006, Boyer participated in the Race Across America again, this time in the new \"Solo Enduro\" category which \"requires\" all participants to use 40 hours of rest (stopping) during the race at official stations along the course. Early in the race Boyer showed he was using a different strategy from other favorites. While the two ahead of him were using minimal rests (30 minutes and 2½ hours after the first 36 hours of racing), Boyer had already used 5½ hour of off-bike time. In the end, all Enduro contenders used their required 40 hours' off-bike time well before the finish, where Boyer prevailed in the Enduro division.\n\nSince 2007 Boyer has lived much of the year in Rwanda where, along with Kimberly Coats, his wife, he runs Team Rwanda, a cycling team for Rwandan cyclists, and assists with Project Rwanda, a relief agency focused on providing bicycles and other aid to people in Rwanda. For three months in mid 2010, former Team BMC Racing professional and 2008 AMGEN Tour of California King of the Mountains winner Scott Nydam and multiple national U.S. cyclo-cross champion Clark Natwick assisted Boyer with training, logistics and testing of the Rwandan team. Adrien Niyonshuti has earned a spot in the 2012 London Summer Olympics cross-country mountain bike race for Rwanda.\n\nIn 2014, Team Rwanda moved to a new complex only a few kilometers from the Gorilla Park Headquarters in Kinigi, Rwanda. The center is called Africa Rising Cycling Center. The program has expanded to include BMX, Junior Road and MTB, Elite MTB and Women Road and MTB.\n\nBoyer returned to Wyoming in 2017 , but remained as an executive director of Team Africa Rising \n\nIn late 2019, Boyer published an open letter listing alleged misconduct within the Rwandan cycling federation, which resulted in the resignation of the federation president and his entire executive team \n\nIn 2009 Boyer completed a motorcycle journey from South Africa to Rwanda on a BMW motorcycle.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2088776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2088776", "title": "United People's Freedom Alliance", "text": "United People's Freedom Alliance\n\nThe United People's Freedom Alliance (abbreviated UPFA; \"Eksath Janathā Nidahas Sandānaya\"; ) was a political alliance in Sri Lanka founded by former Sri Lankan president Chandrika Kumaratunga in 2004. The alliance is generally regarded as being representative of leftist anti imperialistic Sinhalese nationalism.\n\nThe alliance has been led by its senior partner, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, and enjoyed a majority in the Sri Lankan parliament between 2004 and 2015 under both Chandrika Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapakse. The 2015 parliamentary elections saw a partial continuation of its influence on government, with loyalists of the party's Sirisena faction forming a coalition government with the opposition United National Party. The current leader of the UPFA is Maithripala Sirisena, with Mahinda Amaraweera functioning as general secretary. \n\nThe United People's Freedom Alliance was born out of a memorandum of understanding signed by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) in 2004. The agreement was the result of a year's negotiations between the two parties, and broadly outlined common goals in the areas of the economy, ethnic harmony, democracy, \nculture, and foreign policy, areas in which the two parties shared common disagreements with the ruling United National Party (UNP)-led United National Front in power at the time. The agreement did not go into specifics on how differences between the two parties would be resolved, particularly in the area of their differing visions of the solution to the country's ethnic problem. Fundamentally, the memorandum was used as a coalition declaration for the upcoming parliamentary elections, and was a revisiting of the unsuccessful coalition attempt before the 2001 parliamentary elections. The coalition was, in effect, an attempt to oust the ruling UNP based on negative public opinion on its handling of the Sri Lankan Civil War, both in terms of its approach to negotiating with the LTTE and a perceived free hand given to Western interference in the country's democracy through the Norwegian-led peace process. The name of the alliance is believed to have been heavily influenced by the JVP, who insisted it be named \"Eksath Janathā Nidahas Sandānaya\" (Sinhala: United National People's Alliance) such that it preceded the \"Eksath Jāthika Pakshaya\" (Sinhala: United National Party) on the Sinhala ballot paper. The influence of the JVP (and later the Jathika Hela Urumaya) has been identified as one of the reasons for the nationalist leanings of the alliance.\n\nA collection of left-leaning political parties then entered the alliance at various dates after January 2004 with memorandums of understanding of their own. These parties included the Sri Lanka Mahajana Pakshaya, Desha Vimukthi Janatha Pakshaya, Mahajana Eksath Peramuna, the National Congress Party, the Muslim National Unity Alliance, the Communist Party of Sri Lanka and the Lanka Sama Samaja Party. In the April 2004 election, the UPFA won 45.6% of the popular vote and 105 out of 225 seats, limiting the UNP to just 82 seats. Despite the Eelam People's Democratic Party's Douglas Devananda (the party's sole MP) joining the UPFA soon after the election, the alliance formed a minority government, lacking 7 seats for an outright majority. Three MPs from the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress defected to the UPFA on 9 August 2004, while the Ceylon Workers' Congress (CWC) joined the alliance on 3 September with eight sitting MPs, stabilizing the UPFA's position. One more CWC MP, Vadivel Suresh, crossed over on 14 December 2005. Nevertheless, the alliance faced difficulties exerting control or influence in parliament in its early days, notably during the vote for Speaker, where it was unable to get its own ranks to vote for a UPFA candidate.\n\nThe JVP broke away from the alliance on 16 June 2005 with its 39 MPs choosing to sit in opposition, citing differences with the SLFP leadership, particularly those stemming from Chandrika Kumaratunga's proposed Tsunami Relief Council (which the JVP had strongly opposed), and her appointment of Mahinda Rajapakse as Prime Minister, an appointment that the JVP had insisted should (and received assurances would) have gone to Lakshman Kadirgamar. The breakaway was followed by the landmark Supreme Court ruling that declared Kumaratunga's term in office being complete on 21 December 2005, and ordered the Election Commission to hold presidential elections before November 2005. The breakaway notwithstanding, the UPFA contested the election on 17 November with Mahinda Rajapaksa as its candidate and party leader; Rajapakse defeated the United National Party's Ranil Wickremesinghe with 50.29% of the vote. The 2005 election has since been plagued by accusations of manipulation, with opponents of Rajapakse and the UPFA accusing Rajapakse of paying off the LTTE to force ethnic Tamils to boycott the election through its Tamil National Alliance proxy, depriving Wickremesinghe of a key part of the UNP's electoral base.\n\nFour further sets of defections to the UPFA took place between 2006 and 2008:\nIn addition, the UPFA managed to gain control of eight of the nine Provincial Councils between 2008 and 2009, breaking away from the tradition of holding provincial elections on a single date, utilizing victories on the war front as part of their provincial election campaigns.\n\nThe end of the Sri Lankan Civil War in May 2009 is considered to have solidified the UPFA's hold on power. Mahinda Rajapakse contested the presidential election again in January 2010 as the UPFA's candidate, defeating the United National Front-led New Democratic Front's Sarath Fonseka, Rajapske's erstwhile ally and former Commander of the Sri Lanka Army. Fonseka and the NDF rejected the election result, while the Election Commission provided conflicting accounts of the transparency of the polls. The UPFA government denied the allegations and had Fonseka arrested and imprisoned on charges of treason and sedition.\n\nParliamentary elections were held in April 2010, and was won by the UPFA again with a 45.60% share of the vote (105/225 seats). The alliance was not able to realize its campaign goal of a two-thirds majority (required for constitutional reform), however, although a subsequent series of opposition defections helped the alliance gain this majority and push through several constitutional amendments, including the removal of presidential term limits. The UPFA administration initiated several infrastructure developments during the 2010-2015 period, including the country's first expressway network and beautification of the capital city.\n\nDeepening rifts within the Sri Lanka Freedom Party emerged over the 2010-2015 period, culminating in the SLFP's general secretary and minister of health Maithripala Sirisena defecting from the UPFA on 21 November 2014 to contest the 2015 presidential elections as part of a United National Party-led New Democratic Front. The defection resulted in a loss of power for the UPFA in parliament, as loyalists followed Sirisena to the opposition. Sirisena won the prematurely-called election with a 51.28% majority and appointed the UNP's Ranil Wickremesinghe as prime minister of a transitional coalition government dominated by the UNP and supported by Sirisena loyalists in the SLFP and UPFA, while a core of Rajapakse loyalists (the majority of sitting UPFA MPs) decided to sit in the opposition. His victory resulted in Rajapakse handing over the chairmanship of the SLFP to Sirisena on 16 January, while the UPFA Central Committee voted unanimously to appoint him leader of the UPFA on 16 March 2015.\n\nParliament was dissolved by Sirisena in June 2015 for fresh parliamentary elections. On the election held on 17 August 2015, the party won 95 seats (42.38%, down nearly 20% from the previous election) and signed a memorandum of understanding with the United National Party four days later on 21 August, forming a national government. The MoU cited economic development, ensuring freedom and democracy (particularly through implementation of the 19th amendment enacted by the short-lived transitional government), reduction of corruption, development of the health and education sectors, improving foreign relations, securing the rights of women and children, support and development of the arts and culture, and general mutual cooperation between the UPFA and UNP for a period of two years. On 9 February, the Rajapakse faction (consisting of 52 of the 95 UPFA MPs elected) formed an informal coalition named the 'Joint Opposition' and sat in the opposition acting as an independent faction of the UPFA, citing, among other factors, Sirisena's defection and cooperation with the UNP as a betrayal to core SLFP/UPFA voters and principles. The MoU was allowed to lapse in April 2017 and, as of October 2017, has not been renewed; senior UPFA members have cited the results of the ongoing bond issuance scam investigation as being a key point of contention between the two political entities and a central determinant of future collaboration with the UNP.\n\nUPFA states on its Facebook page that it \"stand[s] for Social Justice, Good Governance, Human Rights, Freedom of Education & Expression, Right for Information and above all Freedom on Social Media in Sri Lanka\". The only two languages used on its Facebook page as of 2018 were English and Sinhalese.\n\nThe alliance has shown some tolerance of LGBT through its choice of a transgender person as the highly prestigious Governor of the Central Province, although there remains a large amount of social issues that need to be dealt with concerning transgender people, and furthermore the party has refrained from getting involved with most other aspects of LGBT politics.\n\nThe alliance has few female lawmakers among its ranks. But it has passed a law requiring at least 25% of seats to be given to women, and it has committed to improving gender equality and women empowerment.\n\nThe UPFA had no formal youth wing, utilizing the Sri Lanka Freedom Party's youth wing as its main organ of youth outreach, with constituent parties using their own youth organizations. In 2010, Namal Rajapaksa founded the \"Nil Balakaya\" (Blue Brigade) as a united youth organization for the alliance, incorporating the SLFP youth front and envisioning a supporting role targeting the 2010 presidential election in particular. The Nil Balakaya has been the subject of controversy, being accused of civil disturbances, intimidation and abuse of power; as such, the body was dissolved by the Sirisena unity government in February 2015, and the SLFP youth wing renamed the \"Nidahas Tharuna Peramuna\" (Free Youth Front), returning to its pre-2010 status as the chief youth outreach organ of the alliance.\n\nThe following parties currently make up the United People's Freedom Alliance:\n\n\n"}

It is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean off Europe and Africa and into the south-eastern Indian Ocean. It is an important species in commercial fisheries and is listed as a Vulnerable species on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\n\nThe Atlantic horse mackerel has quite a slender, quite compressed body with a large head in which the rear of the upper jaw reaches the front of the eye and the lower jaw projects beyond the upper jaw. The eye has a well developed adipose eyelid. It has two dorsal fins, the first is tall and has seven thin spines, with the final spine being much shorter than the others. The second dorsal fin is separated from the first by a narrow gap and is considerably longer than the first with 29-33 soft rays. The anal fin is about as long as the second dorsal fin and there are two separate spines at its anterior end. The moderately sized pelvic fin has a single spine and five soft rays and has its origin below the end of the pectoral fin base. A curved line of 33-40 bony scutes runs from the head to the tail, each having a small spine which increase in size and become bonier towards the tail. The lateral line has a total of 66-67 scales, of which 31-36 are scutes. It is dark blue in colour with silvery flanks and a white belly, there is a dark spot on the operculum. This species attains a maximum fork length of , although they are normally around and a weight of .\n\nThe Atlantic horse mackerel occurs in the north and eastern Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea. In the Atlantic it is found from Norway to South Africa where it may extend around the Cape of Good Hope along the southern African Indian Ocean coast Maputo in Mozambique. However, if \"Trachurus capensis\" is considered to be a valid species then this species is restricted to the north east Atlantic. It has been recorded in Cape Verde but is thought to occur there only as a vagrant.\n\nThe Atlantic horse mackerel is a benthopelagic species which normally occurs over sandy substrates at depths of , although it has been reported as deep as and it is sometimes found nearer the surface waters. It is a migratory species, moving northwards in the summer months and returning southwards when the sea temperature starts to fall. In the north east Atlantic two stocks are recognised, the western stock spawns in a wide area from Ireland to the Bay of Biscay in the early Spring and moves northward to the southern coats of Norway and the northern North Sea in the summer. The North Sea stock spawns in the southern part of the North Sea during the summer and then migrates northwards into the central North Sea, the Skagerrak and the Kattegat. Off Mauritania this species has its main spawning season in November to January while the related Cunene horse mackerel (\"Trachurus trecae\") spawns in June and August. Off Ireland spawning occurs irregularly during the summer from June to August reaching its peak in July. The females spawn in batches, each of up to 140,000 eggs and hatching larvae in length. Spawning is indeterminate meaning that the total number of eggs a female can produce is dependant on factors which can change over the course of a spawning season. The eggs and larvae are pelagic.\n\nThe juveniles of thus species frequently often shoal with the juveniles of other fish species, mainly Atlantic herring (\"Clupea clupea\") and with other species of horse mackerels such as the Mediterranean horse mackerel (\"T. mediterraneus\") and blue jack mackerel (\"T. picturatus\"). Juveniles are also often encountered sheltering in the tentacles of jellyfish. In South Africa the maximum recorded age is 24 years while 40 years of age has been recorded in the northeast Atlantic. They are thought to breed from two to four years old for females. Off Mauritania, the juveniles are caught at depths of while mature fish are taken in shallower waters of less than .The age and growth of the Atlantic horse mackerel vary across its extensive range and are affected by the levels to which stocks are exploited.\n\nThe diet of this species, in both juveniles and adults, is copepods, shrimps, small fishes and squids. An examination of the stomach contents of Atlantic horse mackerels caught in the Aegean Sea recorded a total of 60 different prey species which belonged to five major systematic groups, polychaetes, crustaceans, molluscs, arrow worms and bony fish. Copepods, Euphasids and Mysids made up the highest percentage of food eaten. Bony fish were the secondmost numerous food ingested, while polychaeta and arrow worms were infrequently recorded food items. The diet showed very little seasonal variation with copepods and mysids making up the largest proportion of prey throughout the year, with fishes being most frequent prey except in the spring. Larger fish, over fed largely on the larvae of bony fishes. No less than 45 species of copeopod were identified in this study, and \"Acartia clause\" and \"Oncea media\" were numerous and important throughout the year. Crustaceans were the most important prey to be eaten by this species in all seasons, however, bony fish were the most important prey items for larger fish.\n\nThe Atlantic horse mackerel is the type species of the genus \"Trachurus\" but when Constantine Samuel Rafinesque created the genus in 1810 he used \"Trachurus saurus\" as the type species but Carolus Linnaeus had used the name \"Scomber saurus\" and had already described \"Scomber trachurus\" so Rafinesque's name was invalid. The genus \"Trachurus\" is part of the subfamily Caranginae of the family Carangidae, which is the largest family in the order Carangiformes. The generic and specific names are a compound of the Greek \"trachys\" meaning \"rough\" and \"oura\" meaning \"tail\", this appears to be an ancient name for horse mackerels, presumably in reference to the spiny scutes on the caudal peduncle.\n\nThe common name horse mackerel has been said to derive from the belief that other fishes rode on its back but it may derive from the old Dutch word \"Horsmakreel\" which means a mackerel which spawns over a shallow or bank, a \"hors\", and this was taken into English as \"horse mackerel\".\n\nThe Cape horse mackerel (\"Trachurus capensis\") is considered to be the subspecies \"T. trachurus capensis\" of the Atlantic horse mackerel by some authorities and it is thought that there is no adequate series of these specimens of this taxa along the coast of Africa available to confirm the validity of this taxon.\n\nThe Atlantic horse mackerel is fished for commercially using trawls, longlines, purse seines (using artificial light), traps and on line gear. In 1999 the Food and Agriculture Organization stated that the total catch reported to it was 322 207 tonnes with the largest catches being in the Netherlands and in Ireland. There is a total allowable catch (TAC) in the North Sea for this species and landings have consistently been below this level but the TAC is not in line with the scientific advice. There have been calls to create a management plan for the Atlantic horse mackerel in the North Sea but currently there are no specific management objectives for it. The stock needs to be assessed and management objectives should be set before the fishery can be shown to be sustainable.\n\nThe IUCN classify the Atlantic horse mackerel as Vulnerable because even if there has been no decline in the population in European waters there have been greater than ninety percent declines off the West African coast which means that this species will have undergone a decline of at least 35-40% decline over the past three generation lengths, which are estimated at 30-35 years. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) classifies the population of this species as below the safe biological limit for exploitation. The populations are experiencing a slow decline with increased fishing pressure at the maximum sustainable yield since 2006 with low recruitment since 2004.\n\nThe Atlantic horse mackerel is consumed fresh. It may be preserved by freezing, salting and drying, smoking and canning. It can be prepared by frying, broiling or baking. The flesh is said to have a pleasant flavour with an oily delicate texture which is a good sourse of omega-3 fatty acids. Nutritionally 100g of the flesh of the Atlantic horse mackerel provides 97 kcal of energy and is made up of: \n\n\nIn Iberia it may be prepared as an escabeche while some are exported to Japan as \"aji\" to be used in sushi. They are also an important ingredient in Sicilian cuisine.\n"}
{"id": "2088793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2088793", "title": "Sri Lanka Freedom Party", "text": "Sri Lanka Freedom Party\n\nThe Sri Lanka Freedom Party (; ) is one of the major and most well known political parties in Sri Lanka. It was founded by S.W.R.D Bandaranaike in 1951 and, since then, has been one of the two largest parties in the Sri Lankan political arena. It first came to power in 1956 and since then has been the predominant party in government on a number of occasions. The party is generally considered as having a democratic socialist or progressive economic agenda and is often associated with nationalist Sinhalese parties. The party follows a Non-Aligned foreign policy but always had close ties to socialist nations. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party is a Second Main constituent party in the Sri Lanka People's Freedom Alliance.\nAfter independence, the SLFP represented a form of non-revolutionary socialism and a policy of non-alignment with strong ties to socialist countries. Its social democratic and nationalist policies in the aftermath of Sri Lankan independence supported its rapid rise towards attaining major party status alongside the center-right United National Party. Founding leader, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike stated that the basis of the party would be the ‘Pancha Maha Balavegaya’ (Five Great Forces) which consisted of the native doctors, clergy, teachers, farmers and workers.\n\nAfter winning 9 seats in the 1952 parliamentary election, leader S.W.R.D Bandaranaike contested the 1956 election on a platform of giving true meaning to the independence achieved in 1948. This involved a nationalist, democratic and socialist program which saw the SLFP achieve a huge victory at the 1956 elections and is seen by many observers as a social revolution resulting in the eclipse of the Westernized elite.\n\nAmongst the many achievements of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike's term of office include the reverting of major defence facilities from British to local control, initiating a shift in Sri Lanka's foreign policy from the West to the Non-Aligned Movement and lowering the voting age from 21 years to 18 years of age.\n\nWorking people, a core base of support for the party, also benefited through the setting up of an Employee's Provident Fund and the empowerment of peasants through the Paddy Lands Act. The healthcare and education systems were also improved for the benefit of the common man with the establishment of ayurvedic research centers, recognition of native physicians as well as the allowing of students to learn in their mother tongue (rather than only English).\n\nThe S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike government also had a lasting contribution in language policy. In 1956 Sinhala replaced English as the official language of Sri Lanka, fulfilling a major election pledge. In reaction to Tamil unease, the Bandaranaike–Chelvanayakam Pact was signed to grant official status to the Tamil language. However, this agreement was vehemently opposed by extremists led by the main opposition party UNP and instead a watered down act was passed. In September 1959, Bandaranaike was assassinated by an extremist monk opposed to his attempts to allegedly appease Tamils. He was replaced as Prime Minister for an interim period by Wijeyananda Dahanayake.\n\nAfter this, the party turned to Bandaranaike's widow Sirimavo Bandaranaike who consequently in 1960 became the world's first elected female head of government. Sirimavo Bandaranaike was determined to carry on the program of her husband and her government pursued several socialist policies during its terms of office between 1960-1964 and 1970–1977. Sirimavo also initiated the trend of the SLFP forging alliances with other leftist parties such as the Communist Party of Sri Lanka and the Lanka Sama Samaja Party which continues to this day with the United People's Freedom Alliance.\n\nUnder Sirimavo Bandaranaike's leadership, SLFP governments nationalized key sectors of the economy such as banking and insurance, the Ceylon Transport Board and also all schools then owned by the Roman Catholic Church. Issues arose during the state takeover of foreign businesses which upset the United States and Britain. Consequently, this augmented the SLFP's foreign policy shift towards the East and Non-Aligned Movement. Further, in 1972, the SLFP led government oversaw the introduction of a new constitution which changed the country's name from Ceylon to Sri Lanka and declared Sri Lanka to be a republic.\n\nDuring her term in office, Sirimavo Bandaranaike achieved high international standing, being chosen as chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1976 and receiving plaudits as the SLFP led government attempted to mediate between India and China during the Sino-Indian war.\n\nIn government, the SLFP had to also overcome a number of challenges to democracy such as the 1962 coup attempt launched by Christian officers upset by the increasing number of Buddhist officer corp which had previously been three-fifths Christian. Likewise, in 1971 the SLFP led government was almost toppled by a violent Marxist insurrection, which was eventually put down after it claimed more than a thousand lives.\n\nTowards the end of Sirimavo Bandaranaike's second term as Prime Minister, her government had become increasingly unpopular amidst the background of a declining economy and charges of corruption and the SLFP was routed in the 1977 election. This was the start of 17 years in opposition.\n\nThis period of opposition was made greatly difficult after President J.R. Jayewardene's government stripped Sirimavo Bandaranaike of her civic rights for 7 years and expelled her from parliament. As a result, the SLFP fielded Hector Kobbekaduwa at the 1982 Presidential Election, which failed to deliver a strong outcome for the party. The SLFP suffered a further blow in the same year, when a referendum to delay parliamentary elections by 6 years was passed. During this period, the party suffered from internal conflicts, with Sirimavo's daughter and future party leader Chandrika Kumaratunga even leading a breakaway group, the Sri Lanka People's Party.\n\nTowards the early 1990s, the existing UNP government had weakened through internal conflicts of its own as well as the descent into two civil wars and fading public support. New SLFP leaders, most prominently Mahinda Rajapaksa, had launched successful pada yatra, jana gosha and white flag campaigns against the UNP government during this period. However, by this time Sirimavo Bandaranaike had lost her influence with the electorate and was persuaded to step aside as party leader in favor of her daughter Chandrika Kumaratunga who had rejoined the SLFP.\n\nDuring the 1994 parliamentary and presidential elections, SLFP completed a successful return to power and Chandrika Kumaratunga was elected the nation's President as part of the SLFP led People's Alliance coalition. Kumaratunga's tenure marked the beginning of the SLFP's shift from the socialism of Sirimavo towards a more centrist philosophy that sought to combine both the free market and the SLFP's traditional people friendly policies.\n\nThe People's Alliance government continued with their predecessor's attempts to negotiate with the LTTE, whilst simultaneously attempting to weaken them militarily through force. The SLFP government however initially placed greater emphasis on achieving peace with the Kumaratunga government engaging in numerous peace talks. However, LTTE intransigence limited the policy's effectiveness. The People's Alliance can be credited however with significant victories on the foreign policy front, with Foreign Affairs Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar spearheading successful efforts to further isolate the LTTE internationally. Other achievements of the Kumaratunga administration include the establishment of several new public universities.\n\nDespite successes on these fronts, the Kumaratunga government also oversaw territorial losses to the LTTE as well as a flagging economy. As a result of this, a UNP government was elected at the 2001 Parliamentary elections. In November 2003, Kumaratunga used her presidential powers to sack UNP Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe and the People's Alliance returned to power at the 2004 polls with future party leader Mahinda Rajapaksa being appointed as the Prime Minister.\n\nA rift opened up in the party in 2005 over the choice of its candidate for the 2005 Presidential election between the President Kumaratunga backed Anura Bandaranaike and Mahinda Rajapaksa. Many members of the SLFP had been uneasy with Chandrika Kumaratunga's liberal economic policies, privatization of many public institutions as well as several allegations of corruption against her. Ultimately Rajapaksa was selected as the Presidential candidate for the SLFP led United People's Freedom Alliance and was subsequently elected as President\n\nUnder Mahinda Rajapaksa, the SLFP shifted back to the left towards a social democratic program termed Mahinda Chinthana. Some of the companies privatized by the Kumaratunga administration were re-nationalized such as Shell Gas Lanka.\n\nThe major legacy of this period of UPFA government was the end of the long-running civil war and the reunification of Sri Lanka. This achievement boosted the popularity of the SLFP, leading to convincing victories in the presidential and parliamentary polls held in 2010.\n\nIn the post-war period, the Rajapaksa administration instituted a large-scale infrastructure and development drive including the construction and renewal of many of Sri Lanka's key roads, mainly using loans from China. In 2011 the construction of Sri Lanka's first expressway was completed. Likewise, new coal and renewable energy power plants were built, improving the nation's power generation capacity. Tourism received a boost specially in Colombo which ranked as the world's fastest growing tourist city in 2015. However many of such projects launched by Rajapaska mostly named after himself have been called white elephants, being built ignoring feasibility studies, Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport built by Rajapaksa only services one budget carrier and has been built near a migratory route for birds\n\nOther policies of the Rajapaksa government include programs to aid farmers and agricultural production, such as the re-launch of the farmer's pension scheme and subsidization of fertilizers.\n\nIn the area of foreign policy, the Rajapaksa government was seen to align itself towards the East, in accordance with SLFP tradition. This situation was augmented by the prevailing geopolitical environment which led some Western nations to criticize the UPFA government regarding accusations of human rights abuses during the civil war.\n\nDuring this time the government has been implicated of political kidnappings and accused of running a family dynasty of four brothers.\n\nThe 2010-2015 period of SLFP led government was characterized by high economic growth and a reducing debt-to-GDP ratio. But the IMF has said Sri Lanka's national accounts \"suffer from insufficient data sources and undeveloped statistical techniques\" and Opposition legislators have accused Rajapaksa of giving overstated growth estimates. One of the top officials in the statistics office was sacked for disobedience and leaking internal information after he said that economic growth data compiled by the office was inflated\n\nEventually allegations of corruption and nepotism saw Mahinda Rajapaksa lose the presidency to SLFP defector Maithripala Sirisena in 2015, who ran against him with the support of the UNP and other smaller parties. The UNP consequently regained power despite the UPFA still holding a majority of seats in the legislature.\n\nSoon after President Sirisena's victory, Mahinda Rajapaksa handed over leadership of the party to Maithripala Sirisena as per the SLFP constitution which states any SLFP member who is President is automatically leader of the party. Very soon afterwards, the party split into two main factions with those supporting President Sirisena and willing to work with the minority UNP government on one side. The Rajapaksa faction which included parts of the SLFP and UPFA acted as the main de facto opposition to the new regime. Nimal Siripala de Silva was appointed as parliamentary leader of the SLFP and the official Opposition Leader.\n\nDuring Maithripala Sirisena's term as President, SLFP members came to dominate the cabinet numerically, albeit largely with lower ranking positions. The SLFP, especially the Rajapaksa faction, were instrumental in revising the 19th Amendment to the constitution proposed by the UNP so as to reduce Presidential powers without transferring executive powers to the Prime Minister. However, rigorous attempts by President Sirisena and the SLFP to modify the prevailing and unpopular electoral system were unsuccessful due to stiff opposition from the UNP and other smaller parties.\n\nOn 14 August 2015, Party Chairman and President Sirisena issued letter stating that Pro-Rajapaksa loyalist and General Secretary Anura Priyadarshana Yapa has been removed from post and he claimed that Anura Priyadarshana Yapa was going against the party policy and disobeying the commands of chairman, Sirsena appointed his loyalist Duminda Dissanayake as \"acting\" General Secretary 48 hours ahead of Parliamentary Election, Sirisena also obtained court order to prevent Anura Priyadarshana Yapa from functioning as General Secretary thereafter till 24 August 2015, Eventually President Sirisena had sacked both General Secretaries of UPFA and SLFP\n\nIn the August general election the UPFA led by the SLFP only won 95 seats while its rival the UNFGG led by the UNP won 106 seats. The United National Party who won the elections invited SLFP and a MoU was signed with the SLFP to jointly create a government. 45 MPs joined the government and 50 MPs including Mahinda Rajapaksa remained in the Opposition with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party faces an inevitable split.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Sacred mysteries may be either: \nAlthough the term \"mystery\" is not often used in anthropology, access by initiation or rite of passage to otherwise secret beliefs is an extremely common feature of indigenous religions all over the world.\n\nA mystagogue or hierophant is a holder and teacher of secret knowledge in the former sense above. Whereas, mysticism may be defined as an area of philosophical or religious thought which focuses on mysteries in the latter sense above. \n\nThe mystery religions of antiquity were religious cults which required initiation of an \"initiate\" or new member before they were accepted, and sometimes had different levels of initiation, as well as doctrines which were mysteries in the sense of requiring supernatural explanation. In some, parts of the doctrine were apparently only known to priests. They included the Eleusinian Mysteries, Mithraism, the Cult of Isis, the Cult of Sol Invictus, and the Essenes. Mystery traditions were popular in ancient Greece and during the height of the Roman Empire, and parts of Early Christianity used secrecy in the same way.\n\nAlthough the term is not used equally by all Christian traditions, many if not most basic aspects of Christian theology require a supernatural explanation. To name but a few key examples, these include the nature of the Trinity, the virgin birth of Jesus, and the resurrection of Jesus. These are mysteries in the sense that they cannot be explained or apprehended by reason alone.\n\nThe word \"mysterion\" (μυστήριον) is used 27 times in the New Testament. It denotes not so much the meaning of the modern English term \"mystery\", but rather something that is \"mystical\". In the biblical Greek, the term refers to \"that which awaits disclosure or interpretation\". In the Catholic church the Latin term is \"mysterium fidei\", \"mystery of faith\", defined in the Catechism of the Catholic Church (1997) to mean a mystery hidden in God, which can never be known unless revealed by God.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church the First Vatican Council re-affirmed the existence of mysteries as a doctrine of Catholic faith as follows: \"If any one say that in Divine Revelation there are contained no mysteries properly so called (\"vera et proprie dicta mysteria\"), but that through reason rightly developed (\"per rationem rite excultam\") all the dogmas of faith can be understood and demonstrated from natural principles: let him be anathema\" (Sess. III, \"De fide et ratione\", can. i). The position, if not the terminology, of other Christian churches is essentially the same.\n\nIn parts of the Early Christian Church, many aspects of Christian theology, including some sacraments and sacramentals, the so-called \"disciplina arcani\", were kept hidden from the pagans lest they become objects of ridicule, and were also introduced gradually to catechumens or new converts. As the Age of Persecution ended, the secrecy was gradually relaxed. But the term continued to be used, and the same word is used in the Eastern Orthodox churches to describe \"mysteries\" and \"sacraments\". This is not usually so in the West, although theologically many aspects of sacraments are recognized as mysteries in the main sense described above, especially (for those churches accepting it) the doctrine of transubstantiation in the Eucharist. Hence Pope Paul VI's papal encyclical of 3 September 1965 on the Eucharist was titled, from its opening words, \"Mysterium fidei\". In the Roman Rite Catholic Mass within or immediately after the formula of consecration of the wine, the celebrant says \"The mystery of faith\". Originally the term \"Mystery\" was used for the sacraments generally in both the East and the West, as shown from the \"Mystagogical Homilies\" of St. Cyril of Jerusalem and the work, \"On the Mysteries\" by St. Ambrose of Milan.\n\nAlthough all the official doctrines of Christian churches have long been fully public, the loosely defined area of Christian thought called Christian mysticism often concerns the contemplation of sacred mysteries and may include the development of personal theories about them, undertaken in the knowledge that they can never be fully apprehended by man.\n\nThe term is used in Eastern Christianity to refer to what the Western Church currently calls sacraments and sacramentals, terms which the Western Church has carefully defined in canon law. Thus, for instance, the Council of Trent declared there to be \"exactly\" seven sacraments. The Eastern Churches, in contrast, have never defined the Mysteries in such precise terms. And, although the Western Church teaches that the consecrated bread and wine of the Eucharist are one sacrament, the Divine Liturgy refers to the Eucharist as the \"Mysteries\", in the plural. Orthodox Christians have always received Holy Communion in both species (both the body and the blood), and even reserve both in the tabernacle. The sacred mysteries can be defined as \"those holy acts through which the Holy Spirit mysteriously and invisibly confers Grace (the saving power of God) upon man\".\n\nAlthough Orthodox instructional materials may list seven sacred mysteries, the same as the Western seven sacraments: Baptism, Chrismation (Confirmation), Confession (Penance, Reconciliation or Confession), Holy Communion (Eucharist or Holy Communion), Marriage (Holy Matrimony), Ordination (Holy Orders), and Unction (Anointing of the Sick. Archaic: Extreme Unction) (Western names in parentheses), the term is not limited to these seven. As in the West, all faithful men are expected to receive six of the seven listed above, and may or may not receive either marriage or ordination, or both; women may not be received into the priesthood, but may be given monastic orders.\n\nChristian life is centered in the mystery of the incarnation of Christ, the union of God and man. However, the redemption of man is not considered to have taken place only in the past, but continues to this day through theosis. The Sacraments, or Sacred Mysteries are the most important means by which the faithful may obtain union with God, provided they are received with faith after appropriate preparation. Christians believe that God is present everywhere and fills all things by his divine grace, and that all of creation is, in some sense, a \"sacrament\". However, they believe that \"He is more specifically and intensively present in [those] particular and reliable manners which He Himself has established,\" i.e., in the Sacred Mysteries.\n\nIn several other religions, knowledge of some esoteric parts of the doctrine or teachings is reserved only for certain members. This has been a feature of Tantric Buddhism, Hinduism, Catharism, some parts of Shia Islam, and the Druze religion. In traditional Judaism, study of much of the mystical tradition of Kabbalah is reserved for scholars. Esotericism is a strong characteristic of many modern movements such as Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism, Theosophy, and Scientology.\n\n"}

Founded in 1999, the alliance ceased to exist in 2010 when its remaining members joined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.\n\nSri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) leader M. H. M. Ashraff started discussions on forming a new political alliance in 1998. The purpose of the alliance was to bring about unity among Sri Lanka's differing communities. Although initial discussions weren't successful, the alliance was eventually registered with the Department of Elections as a political party on 23 August 1999 with the name National Unity Alliance (NUA). Two political parties were members of the NUA - the SLMC and the Sri Lanka Progressive Front. The aim of the NUA was to create a united Sri Lanka by 2012 and its motto was \"Mother Lanka wants every citizen – All citizens want one Sri Lanka\".\n\nBoth the SLMC and the NUA were members of the governing People's Alliance (PA) but by 2000 relations between the SLMC/NUA and PA had become strained. The SLMC/NUA nevertheless contested the 2000 parliamentary election in alliance with PA - in some electoral districts the SLMC fielded candidates under the PA whilst in others it fielded candidates under the NUA. Contesting in 13 electoral districts the NUA received 197,983 votes (2.29%), winning four seats in Parliament. The SLMC also secured seven seats under the PA.\n\nDuring the 2000 election campaign Ashraff was killed in a mysterious helicopter crash on 16 September 2000. Just before his death Ashraff had sent faxes to the media stating that the SLMC and NUA had severed all ties with the PA. Following Ashraff's death Rauff Hakeem became the SLMC's \"thesiya thalaivar\" (national leader) but there was a power struggle between Ashraff's widow Ferial Ashraff and Hakeem for control of the SLMC. In June 2001 President Chandrika Kumaratunga dismissed Hakeem from the cabinet. All SLMC/NUA ministers, including Ferial Ashraff, resigned from the government on the instructions of the SLMC leadership. The SLMC leadership also decided that the SLCM should leave the PA and join the opposition. However, Ferial Ashraff remained in the PA as leader of the NUA. Three SLMC MPs loyal to Ashraff - Wimalaweera Dissanayake, U. M. Hanifa and U. L. M. Mohideen - also remained in the PA.\n\nContesting under the PA, the NUA secured two seats in Parliament - Ashraff and M. H. Segu Isadean - at the 2001 parliamentary election. On 20 January 2004 the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) formed the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) as a successor to the PA. The NUA joined the UPFA on 2 February 2004. The NUA contested the 2004 parliamentary election under the UPFA and Ashraff and Isadean retained their seats. After the election Ashraff was appointed as a cabinet minister whilst Isadean became a deputy minister.\n\nThe alliance became moribund thereafter and in February 2010 Ferial Ashraff and other NUA members joined the SLFP. The alliance was de-registered as a political party in 2012.\n"}

They are the largest ethnic group in Turkey, as well as by far the largest ethnic group among the Turkic peoples. Ethnic Turkish minorities exist in the former lands of the Ottoman Empire. In addition, a Turkish diaspora has been established with modern migration, particularly in Western Europe.\n\nTurks from the Central Asia settled in Anatolia in the 11th century, through the conquests of the Seljuk Turks. The region then began to transform from a predominantly Greek Christian society into a Turkish Muslim one. The Ottoman Empire came to rule much of the Balkans, the Caucasus, the Middle East (excluding Iran), and North Africa over the course of several centuries. The empire lasted until the end of the First World War, when it was defeated by the Allies and partitioned. Following the Turkish War of Independence that ended with the Turkish National Movement retaking much of the territory lost to the Allies, the Movement abolished the Ottoman sultanate on 1 November 1922 and proclaimed the Republic of Turkey on 29 October 1923. Not all Ottomans were Muslims and not all Ottoman Muslims were Turks, but by 1923, the majority of people living within the borders of the new Turkish republic identified as Turks.\n\nArticle 66 of the Turkish Constitution defines a \"Turk\" as \"anyone who is bound to the Turkish state through the bond of citizenship\". While the legal use of the term \"Turkish\" as it pertains to a citizen of Turkey is different from the term's ethnic definition, the majority of the Turkish population (an estimated 70–75 percent) is of Turkish ethnicity. The vast majority of Turks are Muslims.\n\nThe ethnonym \"Turk\" may have first been discerned in Herodotus' (c. 484–425 BC) reference to Targitas, a king of the Scythians; furthermore, during the first century AD., Pomponius Mela refers to the \"Turcae\" in the forests north of the Sea of Azov, and Pliny the Elder lists the \"Tyrcae\" among the people of the same area. The first definite references to the \"Turks\" mainly come from Chinese sources which date back to the sixth century. In these sources, \"Turk\" appears as \"Tujue\" (), which referred to the Göktürks.\n\nIn the 19th century, the word \"Türk\" only referred to Anatolian villagers. The Ottoman ruling class identified themselves as Ottomans, not usually as Turks. In the late 19th century, as the Ottoman upper classes adopted European ideas of nationalism the term \"Türk\" took on a much more positive connotation.\n\nDuring Ottoman times, the millet system defined communities on a religious basis, and a residue of this remains in that Turkish villagers commonly consider as Turks only those who profess the Sunni faith. Turkish Jews, Christians, or even Alevis may be considered non-Turks. In the early 20th century the Young Turks abandoned Ottoman nationalism in favor of the Turkish nationalism, while adopting the name \"Turks\", which was finally imposed in the Turkish Republic.\n\nAnatolia was first inhabited by hunter-gatherers during the Paleolithic era, and in antiquity was inhabited by various ancient Anatolian peoples. After Alexander the Great's conquest in 334 BC, the area was Hellenized, and by the first century BC it is generally thought that the native Anatolian languages, themselves earlier newcomers to the area, as a result of the Indo-European migrations, became extinct.\n\nThe early Turkic peoples lived somewhere between Central Asia and northwestern China, with genetic data pointing to southern Mongolia and northern China, as semi-agricultural group, but later started their expansion with a predominantly nomadic life style. In Central Asia, the earliest surviving Turkic-language texts, the eighth-century Orkhon inscriptions, were erected by the Göktürks in the sixth century CE, and include words not common to Turkic but found in unrelated Inner Asian languages. Although the ancient Turks were nomadic, they traded wool, leather, carpets, and horses for wood, silk, vegetables and grain, as well as having large ironworking stations in the south of the Altai Mountains during the 600s CE. Most of the Turkic peoples were followers of Tengrism, sharing the cult of the sky god Tengri, although there were also adherents of Manichaeism, Nestorian Christianity and Buddhism. However, during the Muslim conquests, the Turks entered the Muslim world proper as slaves, the booty of Arab raids and conquests. The Turks began converting to Islam after Muslim conquest of Transoxiana through the efforts of missionaries, Sufis, and merchants. Although initiated by the Arabs, the conversion of the Turks to Islam was filtered through Persian and Central Asian culture. Under the Umayyads, most were domestic servants, whilst under the Abbasid Caliphate, increasing numbers were trained as soldiers. By the ninth century, Turkish commanders were leading the caliphs’ Turkish troops into battle. As the Abbasid Caliphate declined, Turkish officers assumed more military and political power taking over or establishing provincial dynasties with their own corps of Turkish troops.\n\n \nDuring the 11th century the Seljuk Turks who were admirers of the Persian civilization grew in number and were able to occupy the eastern province of the Abbasid Empire. By 1055, the Seljuk Empire captured Baghdad and began to make their first incursions into the edges of Anatolia. When the Seljuk Turks won the Battle of Manzikert against the Byzantine Empire in 1071, it opened the gates of Anatolia to them. Although ethnically Turkish, the Seljuk Turks appreciated and became the purveyors of the Persian culture rather than the Turkish culture. Nonetheless, the Turkish language and Islam were introduced and gradually spread over the region and the slow transition from a predominantly Christian and Greek-speaking Anatolia to a predominantly Muslim and Turkish-speaking one was underway.\n\nIn dire straits, the Byzantine Empire turned to the West for help setting in motion the pleas that led to the First Crusade. Once the Crusaders took Iznik, the Seljuk Turks established the Sultanate of Rum from their new capital, Konya, in 1097. By the 12th century the Europeans had begun to call the Anatolian region \"Turchia\" or \"Turkey\", meaning \"the land of the Turks\". The Turkish society of Anatolia was divided into urban, rural and nomadic populations; the other Turkoman (Turkmen) tribes who had also swept into Anatolia at the same time as the Seljuk Turks were those who kept their nomadic ways. These tribes were more numerous than the Seljuk Turks, and rejecting the sedentary lifestyle, adhered to an Islam impregnated with animism and shamanism from their central Asian steppeland origins, which then mixed with new Christian influences. From this popular and syncretist Islam, with its mystical and revolutionary aspects, sects such as the Alevis and Bektashis emerged. Furthermore, the intermarriage between the Turks and local inhabitants, as well as the conversion of many to Islam, also increased the Turkish-speaking Muslim population in Anatolia.\n\nBy 1243, at the Battle of Köse Dağ, the Mongols defeated the Seljuk Turks and became the new rulers of Anatolia, and in 1256, the second Mongol invasion of Anatolia caused widespread destruction. Particularly after 1277, political stability within the Seljuk territories rapidly disintegrated, leading to the strengthening of Turkoman principalities in the western and southern parts of Anatolia called the \"beyliks\".\n\nWhen the Mongols defeated the Seljuk Turks and conquered Anatolia, the Turks became the vassals of the Ilkhans who established their own empire in the vast area which stretched from present-day Afghanistan to present-day Turkey. As the Mongols occupied more lands in Asia Minor, the Turks moved further into western Anatolia and settled in the Seljuk-Byzantine frontier. By the last decades of the 13th century, the Ilkhans and their Seljuk vassals lost control over much of Anatolia to these Turkoman peoples. A number of Turkish lords managed to establish themselves as rulers of various principalities, known as \"Beyliks\" or emirates. Amongst these beyliks, along the Aegean coast, from north to south, stretched the beyliks of Karasi, Saruhan, Aydin, Menteşe and Teke. Inland from Teke was Hamid and east of Karasi was the beylik of Germiyan.\n\nTo the north-west of Anatolia, around Söğüt, was the small and, at this stage, insignificant, Ottoman beylik. It was hemmed in to the east by other more substantial powers like Karaman on Iconium, which ruled from the Kızılırmak River to the Mediterranean. Although the Ottomans were only a small principality among the numerous Turkish beyliks, and thus posed the smallest threat to the Byzantine authority, their location in north-western Anatolia, in the former Byzantine province of Bithynia, became a fortunate position for their future conquests. The Latins, who had conquered the city of Constantinople in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade, established a Latin Empire (1204–61), divided the former Byzantine territories in the Balkans and the Aegean among themselves, and forced the Byzantine Emperors into exile at Nicaea (present-day Iznik). From 1261 onwards, the Byzantines were largely preoccupied with regaining their control in the Balkans. Toward the end of the 13th century, as Mongol power began to decline, the Turcoman chiefs assumed greater independence.\n\nUnder its founder, Osman I, the nomadic Ottoman beylik expanded along the Sakarya River and westward towards the Sea of Marmara. Thus, the population of western Asia Minor had largely become Turkish-speaking and Muslim in religion. It was under his son, Orhan I, who had attacked and conquered the important urban center of Bursa in 1326, proclaiming it as the Ottoman capital, that the Ottoman Empire developed considerably. In 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe and established a foothold on the Gallipoli Peninsula while at the same time pushing east and taking Ankara. Many Turks from Anatolia began to settle in the region which had been abandoned by the inhabitants who had fled Thrace before the Ottoman invasion. However, the Byzantines were not the only ones to suffer from the Ottoman advance for, in the mid-1330s, Orhan annexed the Turkish beylik of Karasi. This advancement was maintained by Murad I who more than tripled the territories under his direct rule, reaching some , evenly distributed in Europe and Asia Minor. Gains in Anatolia were matched by those in Europe; once the Ottoman forces took Edirne (Adrianople), which became the capital of the Ottoman Empire in 1365, they opened their way into Bulgaria and Macedonia in 1371 at the Battle of Maritsa. With the conquests of Thrace, Macedonia, and Bulgaria, significant numbers of Turkish emigrants settled in these regions. This form of Ottoman-Turkish colonization became a very effective method to consolidate their position and power in the Balkans. The settlers consisted of soldiers, nomads, farmers, artisans and merchants, dervishes, preachers and other religious functionaries, and administrative personnel.\n\nIn 1453, Ottoman armies, under Sultan Mehmed II, conquered Constantinople. Mehmed reconstructed and repopulated the city, and made it the new Ottoman capital. After the Fall of Constantinople, the Ottoman Empire entered a long period of conquest and expansion with its borders eventually going deep into Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. Selim I dramatically expanded the empire's eastern and southern frontiers in the Battle of Chaldiran and gained recognition as the guardian of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. His successor, Suleiman the Magnificent, further expanded the conquests after capturing Belgrade in 1521 and using its territorial base to conquer Hungary, and other Central European territories, after his victory in the Battle of Mohács as well as also pushing the frontiers of the empire to the east. Following Suleiman's death, Ottoman victories continued, albeit less frequently than before. The island of Cyprus was conquered, in 1571, bolstering Ottoman dominance over the sea routes of the eastern Mediterranean. However, after its defeat at the Battle of Vienna, in 1683, the Ottoman army was met by ambushes and further defeats; the 1699 Treaty of Karlowitz, which granted Austria the provinces of Hungary and Transylvania, marked the first time in history that the Ottoman Empire actually relinquished territory.\n\nBy the 19th century, the empire began to decline when ethno-nationalist uprisings occurred across the empire. Thus, the last quarter of the 19th and the early part of the 20th century saw some 7–9 million Muslim refugees (Turks and some Circassians, Bosnians, Georgians, etc.) from the lost territories of the Caucasus, Crimea, Balkans, and the Mediterranean islands migrate to Anatolia and Eastern Thrace. By 1913, the government of the Committee of Union and Progress started a program of forcible Turkification of non-Turkish minorities. By 1914, the World War I broke out, and the Turks scored some success in Gallipoli during the Battle of the Dardanelles in 1915. During World War I, the government of the Committee of Union and Progress continued to implement its Turkification policies, which affected non-Turkish minorities, such as the Armenians during the Armenian Genocide and the Greeks during various campaigns of ethnic cleansing and expulsion. In 1918, the Ottoman Government agreed to the Mudros Armistice with the Allies.\n\nThe Treaty of Sèvres —signed in 1920 by the government of Mehmet VI— dismantled the Ottoman Empire. The Turks, under Mustafa Kemal, rejected the treaty and fought the Turkish War of Independence, resulting in the abortion of that text, never ratified, and the abolition of the Sultanate. Thus, the 623-year-old Ottoman Empire ended.\n\nOnce Mustafa Kemal Atatürk led the Turkish War of Independence against the Allied forces that occupied the former Ottoman Empire, he united the Turkish Muslim majority and successfully led them from 1919 to 1922 in overthrowing the occupying forces out of what the Turkish National Movement considered the Turkish homeland. The Turkish identity became the unifying force when, in 1923, the Treaty of Lausanne was signed and the newly founded Republic of Turkey was formally established. Atatürk's presidency was marked by a series of radical political and social reforms that transformed Turkey into a secular, modern republic with civil and political equality for sectarian minorities and women.\n\nThroughout the 1920s and the 1930s, Turks, as well as other Muslims, from the Balkans, the Black Sea, the Aegean islands, the island of Cyprus, the Sanjak of Alexandretta (Hatay), the Middle East, and the Soviet Union continued to arrive in Turkey, most of whom settled in urban north-western Anatolia. The bulk of these immigrants, known as \"Muhacirs\", were the Balkan Turks who faced harassment and discrimination in their homelands. However, there were still remnants of a Turkish population in many of these countries because the Turkish government wanted to preserve these communities so that the Turkish character of these neighbouring territories could be maintained. One of the last stages of ethnic Turks immigrating to Turkey was between 1940 and 1990 when about 700,000 Turks arrived from Bulgaria. Today, between a third and a quarter of Turkey's population are the descendants of these immigrants.\n\nIn the latter half of the 11th century, the Seljuks began settling in the eastern regions of Anatolia. In 1071, the Seljuk Turks defeated the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert, beginning the enlargement of their empire and sphere of influence in Anatolia; the Turkish language and Islam were introduced to Anatolia and gradually spread over the region. The slow transition from a predominantly Christian and Greek-speaking Anatolia to a predominantly Muslim and Turkish-speaking one was underway.\n\nEthnic Turks make up between 70% to 75% of Turkey's population.\n\nThe Turkish Cypriots are the ethnic Turks whose Ottoman Turkish forebears colonised the island of Cyprus in 1571. About 30,000 Turkish soldiers were given land once they settled in Cyprus, which bequeathed a significant Turkish community. In 1960, a census by the new Republic's government revealed that the Turkish Cypriots formed 18.2% of the island's population. However, once inter-communal fighting and ethnic tensions between 1963 and 1974 occurred between the Turkish and Greek Cypriots, known as the \"Cyprus conflict\", the Greek Cypriot government conducted a census in 1973, albeit without the Turkish Cypriot populace. A year later, in 1974, the Cypriot government's Department of Statistics and Research estimated the Turkish Cypriot population was 118,000 (or 18.4%). A coup d'état in Cyprus on 15 July 1974 by Greeks and Greek Cypriots favouring union with Greece (also known as \"Enosis\") was followed by military intervention by Turkey whose troops established Turkish Cypriot control over the northern part of the island. Hence, census's conducted by the Republic of Cyprus have excluded the Turkish Cypriot population that had settled in the unrecognised Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Between 1975 and 1981, Turkey encouraged its own citizens to settle in Northern Cyprus; a report by CIA suggests that 200,000 of the residents of Cyprus are Turkish.\n\nEthnic Turks continue to inhabit certain regions of Greece, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Romania, and Bulgaria since they first settled there during Ottoman period.\n\nAfter World War II, West Germany began to experience its greatest economic boom (\"Wirtschaftswunder\") and in 1961 invited the Turks as guest workers (\"Gastarbeiter\") to make up for the shortage of workers. The concept of the Gastarbeiter continued with Turkey bearing agreements with Austria, Belgium, and the Netherlands in 1964, with France in 1965; and with Sweden in 1967.\n\nCurrent estimates suggests that there are approximately 9 million Turks living in Europe, excluding those who live in Turkey. Modern immigration of Turks to Western Europe began with Turkish Cypriots migrating to the United Kingdom in the early 1920s when the British Empire annexed Cyprus in 1914 and the residents of Cyprus became subjects of the Crown. However, Turkish Cypriot migration increased significantly in the 1940s and 1950s due to the Cyprus conflict. Conversely, in 1944, Turks who were forcefully deported from Meskheti in Georgia during the Second World War, known as the Meskhetian Turks, settled in Eastern Europe (especially in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine). By the early 1960s, migration to Western and Northern Europe increased significantly from Turkey when Turkish \"guest workers\" arrived under a \"Labour Export Agreement\" with Germany in 1961, followed by a similar agreement with the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria in 1964; France in 1965; and Sweden in 1967. More recently, Bulgarian Turks, Romanian Turks, and Western Thrace Turks have also migrated to Western Europe.\n\nCompared to Turkish immigration to Europe, migration to North America has been relatively small. According to the US Census Bureau and Statistics Canada, 196,222 Americans in 2013 and 24,910 Canadians in 2011 were of Turkish descent. However, the actual number of Turks in both countries is considerably larger, as a significant number of ethnic Turks have migrated to North America not just from Turkey but also from the Balkans (such as Bulgaria and North Macedonia), Cyprus, and the former Soviet Union. Hence, the Turkish American community is currently estimated to number about 500,000 while the Turkish Canadian community is believed to number between 50,000–100,000. The largest concentration of Turkish Americans are in New York City, and Rochester, New York; Washington, D.C.; and Detroit, Michigan. The majority of Turkish Canadians live in Ontario, mostly in Toronto, and there is also a sizable Turkish community in Montreal, Quebec. With regards to the 2010 United States Census, the U.S government was determined to get an accurate count of the American population by reaching segments, such as the Turkish community, that are considered hard to count, a good portion of which falls under the category of foreign-born immigrants. The Assembly of Turkish American Associations and the US Census Bureau formed a partnership to spearhead a national campaign to count people of Turkish origin with an organisation entitled \"Census 2010 SayTurk\" (which has a double meaning in Turkish, \"Say\" means \"to count\" and \"to respect\") to identify the estimated 500,000 Turks now living in the United States.\n\nA notable scale of Turkish migration to Australia began in the late 1940s when Turkish Cypriots began to leave the island of Cyprus for economic reasons, and then, during the Cyprus conflict, for political reasons, marking the beginning of a Turkish Cypriot immigration trend to Australia. The Turkish Cypriot community were the only Muslims acceptable under the White Australia Policy; many of these early immigrants found jobs working in factories, out in the fields, or building national infrastructure. In 1967, the governments of Australia and Turkey signed an agreement to allow Turkish citizens to immigrate to Australia. Prior to this recruitment agreement, there were fewer than 3,000 people of Turkish origin in Australia. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, nearly 19,000 Turkish immigrants arrived from 1968 to 1974. They came largely from rural areas of Turkey, approximately 30% were skilled and 70% were unskilled workers. However, this changed in the 1980s when the number of skilled Turks applying to enter Australia had increased considerably. Over the next 35 years the Turkish population rose to almost 100,000. More than half of the Turkish community settled in Victoria, mostly in the north-western suburbs of Melbourne. According to the 2006 Australian Census, 59,402 people claimed Turkish ancestry; however, this does not show a true reflection of the Turkish Australian community as it is estimated that between 40,000 and 120,000 Turkish Cypriots and 150,000 to 200,000 mainland Turks live in Australia. Furthermore, there has also been ethnic Turks who have migrated to Australia from Bulgaria, Greece, Iraq, and North Macedonia.\n\nThe Turkish presence in the Meskheti region of Georgia began with the Turkish military expedition of 1578. However, due to the ordered deportation of over 115,000 Meskhetian Turks from their homeland in 1944, during the Second World War, the majority settled in Central Asia. According to the 1989 Soviet Census, which was the last Soviet Census, 106,000 Meskhetian Turks lived in Uzbekistan, 50,000 in Kazakhstan, and 21,000 in Kyrgyzstan. However, in 1989, the Meshetian Turks who had settled in Uzbekistan became the target of a pogrom in the Fergana valley, which was the principal destination for Meskhetian Turkish deportees, after an uprising of nationalism by the Uzbeks. The riots had left hundreds of Turks dead or injured and nearly 1,000 properties were destroyed; thus, thousands of Meskhetian Turks were forced into renewed exile. The majority of Meskhetian Turks, about 70,000, went to Azerbaijan, whilst the remainder went to various regions of Russia (especially Krasnodar Krai), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Ukraine. Soviet authorities recorded many Meskhetian Turks as belonging to other nationalities such as \"Azeri\", \"Kazakh\", \"Kyrgyz\", and \"Uzbek\". Hence, official census's have not shown a true reflection of the Turkish population; for example, according to the 2009 Azerbaijani census, there were 38,000 Turks living in the country; yet in 1999, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees stated that there were 100,000 Meskhetian Turks living in the country. Furthermore, in 2001, the Baku Institute of Peace and Democracy suggested that there was between 90,000 and 110,000 Meskhetian Turks living in Azerbaijan.\n\nTurkish architecture reached its peak during the Ottoman period. Ottoman architecture, influenced by Seljuk, Byzantine and Islamic architecture, came to develop a style all of its own. Overall, Ottoman architecture has been described as a synthesis of the architectural traditions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.\n\nAs Turkey successfully transformed from the religion-based former Ottoman Empire into a modern nation-state with a very strong separation of state and religion, an increase in the modes of artistic expression followed. During the first years of the republic, the government invested a large amount of resources into fine arts; such as museums, theatres, opera houses and architecture. Diverse historical factors play important roles in defining the modern Turkish identity. Turkish culture is a product of efforts to be a \"modern\" Western state, while maintaining traditional religious and historical values. The mix of cultural influences is dramatized, for example, in the form of the \"new symbols of the clash and interlacing of cultures\" enacted in the works of Orhan Pamuk, recipient of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nTraditional Turkish music include Turkish folk music (Halk müziği), Fasıl and Ottoman classical music (Sanat müziği) that originates from the Ottoman court. Contemporary Turkish music include Turkish pop music, rock, and Turkish hip hop genres.\n\nNotable individuals include Nureddin, Yunus Emre, Takiyüddin, Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu, Bâkî, Hayâlî, Haji Bektash Veli, Ali Kuşçu, Hezârfen Ahmed Çelebi, Lagâri Hasan Çelebi, Piri Reis, Namık Kemal, İbrahim Şinasi, Hüseyin Avni Lifij, Faik Ali Ozansoy, Mimar Kemaleddin, İştirakçi Hilmi, Mustafa Suphi, Ethem Nejat, Halid Ziya Uşaklıgil, Rıza Tevfik Bölükbaşı, Latife Uşşaki, Feriha Tevfik, Fatma Aliye Topuz, Keriman Halis Ece, Zeki Rıza Sporel, Cahide Sonku, Süleyman Seyyid, Abdülhak Hâmid Tarhan, Besim Ömer Akalın, Orhan Veli Kanık, Abidin Dino, Ahmet Ziya Akbulut, Nazmi Ziya Güran, Tanburi Büyük Osman Bey, Vecihi Hürkuş, Bedriye Tahir, Halide Edib Adıvar, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Mehmet Emin Yurdakul, Tevfik Fikret, Nâzım Hikmet, Hulusi Behçet, Nuri Demirağ, Fahrelnissa Zeid, Leyla Gencer, Ahmet Ertegün, Metin Oktay, Fikri Alican, Feza Gürsey, Ismail Akbay, Oktay Sinanoğlu, Gazi Yaşargil, Behram Kurşunoğlu, Fethullah Gülen, Mehmet Öz, Tansu Çiller, Cahit Arf, Muhtar Kent, Efe Aydan, Neslihan Demir, Orhan Pamuk and Aziz Sancar.\n\nThe Turkish language also known as Istanbul Turkish is a southern Oghuz branch of the Turkic languages. It is natively spoken by the Turkish people in Turkey, Balkans, the island of Cyprus, Meskhetia, and other areas of traditional settlement that formerly, in whole or part, belonged to the Ottoman Empire. Turkish is the official language of Turkey. In the Balkans, Turkish is still spoken by Turkish minorities who still live there, especially in Bulgaria, Greece (mainly in Western Thrace), Kosovo, North Macedonia, Romania (mainly in Dobruja) and the Republic of Moldova (mainly in Gagauzia). The Turkish language was introduced to Cyprus with the Ottoman conquest in 1571 and became the politically dominant, prestigious language, of the administration.\n\nOne important change to Turkish literature was enacted in 1928, when Mustafa Kemal initiated the creation and dissemination of a modified version of the Latin alphabet to replace the Arabic alphabet based Ottoman script. Over time, this change, together with changes in Turkey's system of education, would lead to more widespread literacy in the country. Modern standard Turkish is based on the dialect of Istanbul. Nonetheless, dialectal variation persists, in spite of the levelling influence of the standard used in mass media and the Turkish education system since the 1930s. The terms \"ağız\" or \"şive\" often refer to the different types of Turkish dialects.\n\nThere are three major Anatolian Turkish dialect groups spoken in Turkey: the West Anatolian dialect (roughly to the west of the Euphrates), the East Anatolian dialect (to the east of the Euphrates), and the North East Anatolian group, which comprises the dialects of the Eastern Black Sea coast, such as Trabzon, Rize, and the littoral districts of Artvin. The Balkan Turkish dialects are considerably closer to standard Turkish and do not differ significantly from it, despite some contact phenomena, especially in the lexicon. In the post-Ottoman period, Cypriot Turkish was relatively isolated from standard Turkish and had strong influences by the Cypriot Greek dialect. The condition of coexistence with the Greek Cypriots led to a certain bilingualism whereby Turkish Cypriots knowledge of Greek was important in areas where the two communities lived and worked together. The linguistic situation changed radically in 1974, when the island was divided into a Greek south and a Turkish north (Northern Cyprus). Today, the Cypriot Turkish dialect is being exposed to increasing standard Turkish through immigration from Turkey, new mass media, and new educational institutions. The Meskhetian Turks speak an Eastern Anatolian dialect of Turkish, which hails from the regions of Kars, Ardahan, and Artvin. The Meskhetian Turkish dialect has also borrowed from other languages (including Azerbaijani, Georgian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Russian, and Uzbek), which the Meskhetian Turks have been in contact with during the Russian and Soviet rule.\n\nAccording to the CIA factbook, 99.8% of the population in Turkey is Muslim, most of them being Sunni (Hanafi). The remaining 0.2% is mostly Christian and Jewish. There are also some estimated 10 to 15 million Alevi Muslims in Turkey. Christians in Turkey include Assyrians/Syriacs, Armenians, and Greeks. Jewish people in Turkey include those that descend from Sephardic Jews who escaped Spain in 15th century and Greek-speaking Jews from Byzantine times. There is an ethnic Turkish Protestant Christian community most of them came from recent Muslim Turkish backgrounds, rather than from ethnic minorities.\n\nAccording to KONDA research, only 9.7% of the population described themselves as \"fully devout,\" while 52.8% described themselves as \"religious.\" 69.4% of the respondents reported that they or their wives cover their heads (1.3% reporting chador), although this rate decreases in several demographics: 53% in ages 18–28, 27.5% in university graduates, 16.1% in masters-or-higher-degree holders. Turkey has also been a secular state since the republican era. According to a poll, 90% of respondents said the country should be defined as secular in the new Constitution that is being written.\n\nAn autosomal DNA study of Turks in 2014 by Can Alkan found that the Turkic East Asian impact on modern Turkey was 21.7% A study in 2015 found that \"\"Previous genetic studies have generally used Turks as representatives of ancient populations from Turkey. Our results show that Turks are genetically shifted towards modern Central Asians, a pattern consistent with a history of mixture with populations from this region\"\".\n\nA study involving mitochondrial analysis of a Byzantine-era population, whose samples were gathered from excavations in the archaeological site of Sagalassos, found that the Byzantine population of Sagalassos might have left a genetic signature in the modern Turkish populations. Modern-day samples from the nearby town of Ağlasun showed that lineages of East Eurasian descent assigned to macro-haplogroup M were found in the modern samples from Ağlasun. This haplogroup is significantly more frequent in Ağlasun (15%) than in Byzantine Sagalassos. One study found that results pointed out that language (Turkish) in Anatolia might not have been replaced by the elites, but by a large group of people, which means there was no elite assimilation in Anatolia. Another study found the Circassians are closest to the Turkish population among sampled European (French, Italian, Sardinian), Middle Eastern (Druze, Palestinian), and Central (Kyrgyz, Hazara, Uygur), South (Pakistani), and East Asian (Mongolian, Han) populations.\n\n"}

Traditionally the unit was one hundred pounds (German \"Pfund\") with the precise value being context-dependent, making one zentner equal to about 50 kilograms.\n\nIn later times, with the adoption of the metric system, the value came to denote exactly 50 kg, at least in Germany; in Austria and Switzerland the term is now in use for a measure of 100 kg, as it is in Russia (, \"tsentner\").

{"id": "2088861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2088861", "title": "Extern minister", "text": "Extern minister\n\nIn the Irish Free State, an extern minister, formally a Minister who shall not be a Member of the Executive Council, was a minister who had charge of a department but was not a member of the Executive Council. Extern ministers were individually nominated by Dáil Éireann (the lower house), whereas of the Executive Council only the President was: he in turn nominated the other members. All ministers were formally appointed by the Governor-General. The Executive Council included the senior ministers, exercised cabinet collective responsibility, and had to be TDs (members of the Dáil); the extern ministers filled more junior technocratic roles, and need not be legislators, though in fact all were TDs. In practice, all ministers formed a united administration, and no extern ministers were appointed after 1927.\n\nJames G. Douglas, chair of the constitution drafting committee, proposed extern ministers on the model of the Swiss Federal Council. Leo Kohn suggested a precursor was the \"Directors\" created outside the 1919 Dáil Cabinet by the First Dáil, but Nicholas Mansergh disagreed and Brian Farrell felt the 1919 model was UK junior ministers (parliamentary secretaries). The idea of extern ministers was first mooted as a way of placating republicans opposed to the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty on which the Free State was founded. It would have allowed republicans to hold ministries in a national unity government without their having to take the Oath of Allegiance which the Treaty required of members the Oireachtas (parliament). The draft constitution provided for an Executive Council of twelve, of whom four, including the President and Vice President, must be members of the Dáil; of the other eight, at most three might be members of the Dáil or Seanad (upper house). However, British government objections meant the proposal was altered, and extern ministers were required to take the Oath and, though nominated by the Dáil, were appointed by the Governor General. These monarchist changes were unacceptable to republicans.\n\nNevertheless, as introduced, it still was hoped that extern ministers might be independent non-party figures, possibly non-politicians, who were not even members of the Oireachtas. The Third Dáil as a constituent assembly passed a resolution on 6 October 1922 which stated in part:\nA committee was formed to draft corresponding articles for the Constitution, and subsequently another committee nominated ministers for relevant departments.\n\nThe relevant provisions were articles 55 and 56 of the Constitution:\n\nThe portfolios to which extern ministers were appointed were Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Minister for Lands and Agriculture, Minister for Fisheries, and Minister for Local Government and Public Health. Although extern ministers were appointed from 1922 until 1927, in reality they formed a single Cumann na nGaedheal government with the Executive Council, rather than being independent of it. No extern minister was chosen from outside the Dáil; nor from the opposition (Labour, Farmers' Party, or independents) despite the requirement to be \"impartially representative of Dáil Eireann\". The corporatist vocational councils mentioned in Article 56 were never created. The Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 required that the parliamentary secretary of an extern minister be a member of the Dáil, whereas Executive Council ministers' parliamentary secretary were permitted to be from either house of the Oireachtas. In fact, only Dáil deputies were ever appointed.\n\nThe Annual Report of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for the year 1921 (delayed by the Civil War) was submitted by the Minister for Agriculture, Patrick J. Hogan, on 22 February 1923 to the Executive Council for transmission to the Governor General. Labour leader Thomas Johnson objected that, as an extern minister, Hogan should have submitted the report to the Dáil rather than the Executive Council; Hogan agreed that it had been a mistake.\n\nThe Constitution (Amendment No. 5) Act, 1927 increased the maximum size of the Executive Council from seven to twelve. Thereafter, since twelve was the maximum total number of Ministers, there was no point in a TD being an extern minister rather than a member of the Executive Council. The amendment was enacted just before the June 1927 general election, and the subsequent Executive Council included the portfolios previously assigned to extern ministers. Although there was still the possibility of a senator or non-legislator being appointed extern minister, senators objected that Amendment No. 5 made a senator minister less likely. The Constitution (Amendment No. 15) Act, 1929 allowed a senator to be a member of the Executive Council.\n\nThe 1937 Constitution requires ministers to be members of the Oireachtas. The Constitutional Convention in 2013 recommended allowing non-legislators to become ministers; Enda Kenny rejected this, on the basis that someone nominated to the Senate by the Taoiseach could become a minister. This has happened twice: Seán Moylan in 1957 and James Dooge in 1981–1982.\n\n"}

Concerns about massive growth of telephone tapping incidents led to growing demand for secure telephones.\n\nThe practical availability of secure telephones is restricted by several factors; notably politics, export issues, incompatibility between different products (the devices on each side of the call have to use the same protocol), and high (though recently decreasing) price of the devices.\n\nThe best-known product on the US government market is the STU-III family. However, this system has now been replaced by the Secure Terminal Equipment (STE) and SCIP standards which defines specifications for the design of equipment to secure both data and voice.

A new family of standard secure phones has been created based on Philip Zimmermann's VoIP encryption standard ZRTP.\n\nAs the popularity of VoIP grows, secure telephony is becoming more widely used. Many major hardware and software providers offer it as a standard feature at no extra cost.\n\nExamples include the Gizmo5 and Twinkle. Both of the former work with offerings from the founder of PGP, Phil Zimmermann, and his VoIP secure protocol, ZRTP. ZRTP is implemented in, amongst others, Ripcord Networks product SecurePC with up to NSA Suite B compliant Elliptic Curve math libraries. ZRTP is also being made available for mobile GSM CSD as a new standard for non-VoIP secure calls.\n\nThe U.S. National Security Agency is developing a secure phone based on Google's Android called Fishbowl.\n\nScramblers were used to secure voice traffic during World War II, but were often intercepted and decoded due to scrambling's inherent insecurity. The first true secure telephone was SIGSALY, a massive device that weighed over 50 tons. NSA, formed after World War II, developed a series of secure telephones, including the STU I, STU II and STU-III, as well as voice encryption devices for military telephones.\n\nIn 1989 an Irish company called Intrepid developed one of the most advanced secure phones. Called Milcode, the phone was the first to implement code-excited linear prediction (or CELP) which dramatically improved voice quality and user operability over previous LPC (Linear Predictive Coding) and LPC-10e versions.\n\nMilcode also boasted significantly higher levels of security than previous secure telephones. The base model offered a proprietary encryption algorithm with a key length of 512 bits, and a more advanced model with a key length of 1024 bits. Key exchange used a public key, based on Diffie-Hellman, as opposed to a plug-in datakey. A new key was generated for each phone call. Milcode was also able to encrypt fax and data and was electromagnetically shielded to NATO TEMPEST standards.\n\nOther products of historical significance are PGPfone and Nautilus (designed as a non-key escrow alternative to Clipper, now officially discontinued, but still available on SourceForge), \"SpeakFreely\", and the security VoIP protocol wrapper Zfone developed by the creator of PGP.\n\nScrambling, generally using a form of voice inversion, was available from electronic hobbyist kit suppliers and is common on FRS radios. Analog scrambling is still used, as some telecommunications circuits, such as HF links and telephone lines in the developing world, are of very low quality.\n\n\n"}

The day is celebrated widely by many other organizations concerned with food security, including the World Food Programme and the International Fund for Agricultural Development.\n\nThe World Food Day theme for 2014 was Family Farming: \"Feeding the world, caring for the earth\"; in 2015 it was \"Social Protection and Agriculture: Breaking the Cycle of Rural Poverty\"; in 2016 it is Climate Change: \"Climate is changing. Food and agriculture must too\", which echoes the theme of 2008, and of 2002 and 1989 before that..\n\nWorld Food Day (WFD) was established by FAO's Member Countries at the Organization's 20th General Conference in November 1979. The Hungarian Delegation, led by the former Hungarian Minister of Agriculture and Food Dr. Pál Romány, played an active role at the 20th Session of the FAO Conference and suggested the idea of celebrating the WFD worldwide.\nIt has since been observed every year in more than 150 countries, raising awareness of the issues behind poverty and hunger.\n\nSince 1981, World Food Day has adopted a different theme each year in order to highlight areas needed for action and provide a common focus.\n\nMost of the themes revolve around agriculture because only investment in agriculture – together with support for education and health – will turn this situation around. The bulk of that investment will have to come from the private sector, with public investment playing a crucial role, especially in view of its facilitating and stimulating effect on private investment.\n\nIn spite of the importance of agriculture as the driving force in the economies of many developing countries, this vital sector is frequently starved of investment. In particular, foreign aid to agriculture has shown marked declines over the past 20 years.\n\n\nIn over 150 countries, events mark World Food Day. Examples of events across the world held in recent years are listed.\n\n\"World Food Day\" is celebrated in honour of the date of the founding of the FAO of the United Nations in 1945. It is also followed in India.\n\nWorld Food Day has been a tradition in the United States since the first World Food Day in 1982. In the United States the endeavor is sponsored by 450 national, private voluntary organizations. One example for World Food Day events is the World Food Day Sunday Dinners that Oxfam America sponsors in collaboration with several other non-profits. Emeritus Archbishop Desmond Tutu and author Francis Moore Lappe have teamed up with Oxfam America to promote World Food Day Sunday Dinners.\nThe Iowa Hunger Summit has been held on or near World Food Day since 2007, and is organized by the World Food Prize in conjunction with their annual symposium in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nIn Italy, ministries, universities, research agencies, international agencies, and NGOs have organized many conferences as well as exhibitions and symposia. The Italian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Policies organized a meeting which focused on women's rights in rural areas in 2005.\n\nIn Germany, the Federal Ministry of Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture have all become involved via press conferences. Spanish television has been active in broadcasting events. FAO Goodwill Ambassador – Spanish soccer star Raul – has taken part in events and helped highlight food-security issues across his country.\n\nThe UK Food Group has also been active through conferences and media broadcasts. In the emerging economies of Eastern Europe – i.e., Albania, Armenia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Georgia, Hungary, Macedonia, Moldova, Serbia and Montenegro, and Slovak Republic – a variety of activities have been held.\n\nIn Hungary, renowned experts have given presentations in the Hungarian Agricultural Museum and FAO, and WFD medals have been awarded to well-known Hungarian experts by the FAO Sub-Regional Representative.\n\nOn behalf of the Holy See, Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI have sent an annual message for food producers and consumers on World Food Day.\n\nAngola celebrated WFD in 2005 through the 4th Forum on Rural Women, while in Burundi the second Vice-President planted potatoes to provide a symbolic example about food production. In Central African Republic, the President of the Republic has inaugurated a bridge at Boda to coincide with World Food Day, making the agricultural production area more accessible.\n\nIn Chad, thousands of people have attended debates, conferences and activities including theatre, films, folk dance, visits to project sites and visits by agricultural companies.\n\nIn Ghana, the Ministry of Food and Agriculture has hosted a food security conference, while Namibia has run an awareness campaign through national media.\n\nIn Botswana, the National Food technology research center recently exhibited its products and services at the World Food Day commemoration held at Kalakamati Farm on 19 October 2017.\n\nEgypt has hosted a Forum on nutrition issues. Morocco and Tunisia have held seminars and exhibitions.\nIn Nigeria, organizations and individuals involved in feeding programs (e.g. Foodbank Nigeria) connect with other stakeholders in food production, agro-allied industries, wholesalers and community-based organizations to address food security challenges. For example, since 2009, Northern Nigeria is unstable. According to the humanitarian organisation Action Against Hunger (AAH), the ongoing and deepening humanitarian crisis in Northeast Nigeria has led to the displacement of over 1.5 million people, causing four million people to experience acute food insecurity and be in need of humanitarian assistance (Action Against Hunger). Since 2010, the AAH have been working with both \"national agencies\" and \"local communities\" to build capacity to treat deadly malnutrition caused by food insecurity (Action Against Hunger).\n\nThe Government of Bangladesh has been involved through organizing a food festival; in China in 2005, celebrations were organized in Qujing City, where numerous ethnical minorities live, by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Government of Qujing City, with the participation of a number of senior officials of the Government.\n\nIn the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, seminars have been held and visits made to various project sites. The Ministry of Agriculture of Indonesia has in the past organized a major Food Expo in Bandung, West Java, while a Farmers' and Fishermen's Workshop of NGOs was held in Bali.\n\nIn Armenia, staff from the Ministry of Agriculture, non-governmental organizations, Armenian State Agriculture University, the donor community, international organizations, and the mass media have participated in the World Food Day ceremony. In Afghanistan, representatives of Ministries, embassies, UN agencies, International Financial Organizations, National and International NGOs, and FAO staff have attended the World Food Day ceremony.\n\nIn Cyprus, special ceremonies have been organized in primary and secondary schools, where teachers explained the significance of World Food Day.\n\nIn Pakistan, a Society Named as MAPS (Mentor Amiable Professional Society) celebrates world food day by providing food packages to poor & née-dies and tells the importance of food to the people by organizing workshops.\n\nIn Philippines on 16 October 2015, writer and realty entrepreneur Wilson Lee Flores started celebrating \"World Pandesal Day\" at the non-partisan Pandesal Forum of his popular Kamuning Bakery Cafe in Judge Jimenez Street corner K-1st Street, Quezon City. He and celebrities like GMA Network, Inc. Chairman Atty. Felipe Gozon, Senator Sonny Angara and actor Dingdong Dantes gave away 30,000 \"pugon\" or wood-fired brick oven breads plus other gifts to urban poor families. In 2016, he repeated this civic project with celebrities like Quezon City Vice-Mayor Joy Belmonte and business leader Dr. James Dy of the Philippine Chinese Charitable Association, plus undertaking free medical, dental and optical missions for urban poor families.\n\nOn 16 October 2017, Wilson Lee Flores increased gifts to urban poor families to 50,000 pugon-baked breads, Mega sardines, King Sue hams, Fly Ace and Hobe noodles, OK Koolers juices, plus two dates for free medical, dental and optical missions on 8 October and 29 October. Special guests at this 3rd \"World Pandesal Day\" were led by Supreme Court Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno, Vice-President Leni Robredo and Philippine National Police (PNP) chief General Ronald Dela Rosa accompanied by Quezon City senior superintendent Guillermo Eleazar.\n\nIn Mongolia, for the World Food Day celebration in the country, it has become a tradition that the research conference \"Food security\" is annually organized by Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Light Industry and UN FAO representative office in Mongolia cooperated with Mongolian Food Industry Association. This traditional event gives a significant opportunity to promote research works, to value the contributions on the country's food security of scholars and researchers, to strengthen the cooperation and collaboration between research institutions, NGOs and food related public organization, to transfer the technological research in the industry and to develop the research-based policy and regulations etc.\n\nIn Chile, exhibitions of indigenous food products have been prepared by local communities.\n\nIn Argentina, senior officials of the Government, academics, international organizations and the press have participated in the main ceremony. In Mexico in 2005, a National Campaign for a \"Mexico Without Hunger\" was held, with the involvement and support of civil society and students.\n\nIn Cuba, producers have been able to exchange views and experiences at an agricultural fair. The media strongly supports awareness campaigns on World Food Day.\n\nIn Venezuela, there has been national coverage of events.\n\n\n"}

It was a sonic departure for Moloko, with tracks less reliant on electronics and more on live musicians. In addition to the change in musical styles, the album featured new vocal technique, from the lead singer Róisín Murphy. At time of release, Murphy summed up the previous style of her lyrics, saying, \"I was nineteen when I made \"Tight Sweater\", and I knew I was pretending, but if I tried not to, I'd still be pretending. Now, I know myself better,\" and her lyrics on this album are described as, \"Roisin's most direct and emotionally honest lyrics [so far].\"\n\nAfter the release of \"Things to Make and Do\", offers came in for Murphy to guest on others' records, most notably The Psychedelic Waltons, Boris D. and Handsome Boy Modelling School. The album held the record as Echo's fastest-selling UK platinum record, until beaten by Feeder's \"The Singles\" compilation six years later. The track \"Indigo\" was featured on the soundtrack to \"Mystery Men\".\n\nAs of May 2015, the album has sold over 355,000 copies in the UK. As of December 2000 it has sold more than 750,000 units worldwide.\n\n\"The Time Is Now\", the album's first single, became Moloko's biggest hit, peaking at number two on the UK Singles Chart and prompted a number three UK album début for \"Things to Make and Do\".\n\nBefore the album's release, an unsolicited Boris Dlugosch \"Sing It Back\" remix became a club, then mainstream, hit (originally a drum and bass-ish track on \"I Am Not a Doctor\", their previous album). After the remix stormed Ibiza and Miami, then achieved scores of dance mix compilation inclusions, it was added to \"Things to Make and Do\" as a bonus track.\n\n\"All songs written by Mark Brydon and Róisín Murphy, except where noted.

{"id": "2088886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2088886", "title": "United National Front (Sri Lanka)", "text": "United National Front (Sri Lanka)\n\nThe United National Front (UNF) () later the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) ( \"Eksath Yahapalana Jathika Peramuna\"; ) is a political alliance in Sri Lanka formed by the United National Party, the alliance currently represents 7 parties including the largest Muslim party Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and the Sinhala Nationalist Jathika Hela Urumaya. The UNF is former governing party in the Parliament of Sri Lanka. A new UNP led alliance, the National Democratic Front (NDF) is in the process of being formed for future elections.\n\nThe UNF was formed as an alliance in 2001 to battle president Kumaratunga's SLFP led People's Alliance in 2001 parliamentary election. Initial members were the United National Party, the Ceylon Workers' Congress, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and the Western People's Front. The alliance won the election by securing 109 seats in the parliament, which was 4 seats short of a majority. UNF government had been in limbo since October 2003, when President Kumaratunga declared a state of emergency and took three key cabinet portfolios for her party. During the campaign, she argued that prime minister Wickremasinghe had been too soft on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and promised to take a harder line. The UNF, for its part, stressed the economic gains that had been made with the ceasefire and the need to find a negotiated solution to the civil war. Eventually, President Kumaratunga dissolved the parliament and called an election in 2004, which UNF lost to newly formed United People's Freedom Alliance. In 2006, CWC left the alliance to join UPFA.\n\nUNP and SLMC once again contested 2010 parliamentary election from UNF and only secured 29.34% of the popular vote and 60 out of 225 seats. After the election, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress left the UNF and joined President Rajapaksa's UPFA government.\n\nThe UNP had contested past parliamentary elections in alliance with smaller parties representing ethnic minorities but many of these had defected to the UPFA after the election. The United National Front was once again re-activated by United National Party to form as common front against the re-emergence of Rajapaksa who was defeated on 8 January 2015 Presidential Election, with the support of many parties such as the Jathika Hela Urumaya, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, Tamil National Alliance etc. as a major coalition to support the progress of the Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena. Prior to this election being called the UNP had claimed it would contest the election on its own. However, after the election had been called it started forming alliances with minority parties including the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) and Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA). Democratic Party led by Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka signed an MOU with Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe to join the front on 3 February, 2016. On 12 July 2015 the UNP, SLMC and TPA signed agreements with the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) and anti-Rajapaksa members of the SLFP to form the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) to contest the election. The All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) also contested with the UNFGG. The UNFGG is believed to have had the tacit support of President Sirisena but officially he has pledged to be neutral.\n\nThe UNFGG had originally been established by the renaming of the JHU after it left the UPFA. It was registered as a political party with the diamond symbol. Despite this the UNFGG contested the election under the name and elephant symbol of the UNP. UNFGG general-secretary Champika Ranawaka has stated that the JHU name and its conch symbol will be revived after the election. \n\nThe UNFGG became the largest group in Parliament after securing 45.66% of votes and 106 seats whilst the UPFA won 42.38% of votes and 95 seats. Rajapaksa quickly conceded defeat in his attempt to become Prime Minister. Later, 42 members of the opposition joined the government, giving them a 2/3 majority. The result left the UNFGG seven seats short of a majority in Parliament. However, on 20 August 2015 the central committee of the SLFP agreed to form a national government with the UNP for two years. Wickremesinghe was sworn in as Prime Minister on 21 August 2015. Immediately afterwards a memorandum of understanding to work together in Parliament was signed by acting SLFP general secretary Duminda Dissanayake and UNP general secretary Kabir Hashim.\n\nThe working committee of the United National Party, the leading party of the alliance appointed opposition leader Sajith Premadasa as the leader of the new alliance. Premadasa will also lead the 2020 General election as the Prime minister candidate. UNP senior Ranjith Madduma Bandara was named as the alliance General Secterey.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2088888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2088888", "title": "Ceylon Workers' Congress", "text": "Ceylon Workers' Congress\n\nThe Ceylon Workers' Congress (CWC) (; \"Lanka Kamkaru Kongrasaya\") is a political party in Sri Lanka that has traditionally represented Sri Lankan Tamils of Indian origin working in the plantation sector of the economy.\nThe CWC was formed by Peri Sundaram and G. R. Motha as an Indian Estates Workers Trade Union in 1950. It was an outgrowth of the Ceylon Indian Congress (CIC), formed 15 July 1939. In 1950 the CIC changed its name to the Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) and became the largest trade union in the country. Another trade union, the Democratic Workers Congress (DWC), was formed in 1956 as a breakaway faction of the CWC as a result of leadership rivalries between the president, S. Thondaman, and the general secretary A. Aziz. The former retained control of the CWC to date. Thondaman has been the dominant trade union leader of the Indian Tamil workers for nearly four decades. As president of the Ceylon Indian Congress, he contested the Nuwara Eliya seat at the 1947 general election and won. His party put forward eight candidates in the plantation electorates and seven of them were returned, they were Thondaman, S. M. Subbaiah (Badulla), G. R. Motha (Maskeliya), K. Rajalingam (Nawalapitiya), K. Kumaravelu (Kotagala), C. V. Velupillai (Talawakelle) and D. Ramanujam (Alutnuwara).\n\nThe political potentiality of the Indian Tamil workers and the CIC led by Thondaman were viewed as threats to the power of the ruling United National Party. Another view was that the enfranchisement of the Indian workers would interfere with the representation of the Kandyan Sinhalese in the legislature. However, the main reason for the disenfranchisement was the fear of political leaders like Senanayake (and even Ponnambalam) that the estate sector would become a prey to the Marxist movement. The left movement was militant and had a public image which concealed that its political strength was minuscule. However, the political leaders of the era had a more pessimistic prognosis.\n\nEven though the Donoughmore Constitution had granted universal franchise to Ceylonese, this was not applied to the Indian Estate Tamils, due to opposition from caste-conscious Colombo Tamils, vote conscious Kandyan Sinhalese, as well as due to the general opposition to any form of universal franchise. The latter was named \"mob rule\" by Arunachalam Ponnambalam. Thus, even by 1939, only a fraction of the Hill-country Tamils had been granted the franchise. The fear of Marxist control of the estates, as well as the pressure of Kandyan politicians, led to attempts to not to extend citizenship to the Indian Tamils of the newly independent nation, except under very stringent conditions. In effect, the Ceylon Citizenship Act of 1948 and the Indian and Pakistani Residents (Citizenship) Act No.3 of 1949 were passed by the Sri Lankan Parliament and simply reinforced the \"status quo\" of the harsher pre-Donoughmore era prior to Universal Franchise (see Sri Lanka Tamils (Indian origin) for more details of dis-enfranchisement).\n\nThondaman opposed those laws and argued that most of the Indians were permanent residents and were the sons and daughters of the soil as are the Sinhalese or the \"Malabar Tamils\". The Marxist politicians criticised the move as an act of capitalist-imperialist lackeys, while S.J.V. Chelvanayakam the criticised the government as a Sinhala extremist regime, and branded Ponnambalam a traitor.\n\nThondaman's political organization staged a non-violent satyagraha campaign against the implementation of citizenship laws and boycotted them for a period of time. Since 1952, the Indian Tamils could not elect any representative to the Parliament as their voting strength was drastically reduced.\n\nThondaman supported the Sri Lanka Freedom Party in the 1960 elections and, after the victory of this party, was appointed to the House of Representative as a nominated Member of Parliament. On December 3, 1964, Thondaman declined to vote on a motion connected with the Governor General's Throne Speech. This brought about the downfall of the SLFP government led by Sirimavo Bandaranaike.\n\nIn the March 1965 elections, Thondaman shifted to the UNP to protest against the terms of the Indo-Ceylon Agreement of October 1964. After the victory of the UNP in 1965, S. Thondaman was named as appointed Member of Parliament.\n\nHe was out of Parliament from 1970 to 1977 after the defeat of the UNP in the general election of 1970. During this period the CWC under his leadership gradually allied itself with the major Tamil political parties and subscribed to form the Tamil United Front (TUF). He was also elected a leader of the triumvirate leadership of this Tamil political organization.\n\nIn May 1975, the TUF stressed that its objective was the setting up of the separate free, secular, sovereign, socialist state of Tamil Eelam and renamed itself into Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF). Thondaman did not want to subscribe to this new separatist policy of the TULF and withdrew from it.\n\nHe shifted his loyalties towards the United National Party which came to power in 1977. He served on the select committee for the revision of the constitution in 1978. In September 1978, he was invited by President J. R. Jayawardhane to join the Cabinet, which he accepted after the Executive Council of the Ceylon Workers Congress decided to do so.\n\nSince 1978, Thondaman has served as a Cabinet minister under Presidents J. R. Jayawardhane, R.Premadasa and since 1995 under president Chandrika Bandaranaike.\n\nWhen he joined the UNP government, he explained that he owed his position to the CWC, and the CWC's policy was to get citizenship for the stateless and better working conditions for estate labour.\n\nAt the last legislative elections, held on 2 April 2004, the party was a minor partner in the UNP-dominated United National Front that won 37.8% of the popular vote and 82 out of 225 seats.\n"}

Viswanathan\n\nManayangath Subramanian Viswanathan (24 June 1928 – 14 July 2015), also known as M.S.V., was an Indian music director, composer, and singer. He was popularly known as \"Mellisai Mannar\" (Tamil for \"Melody King\"). He composed songs for more than 800 Indian films and various albums. across languages primarily in Tamil, Malayalam and Telugu films. He has also acted and sung in a few Tamil films. The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu J Jayalalithaa conferred the \"Thirai Isai Chakravarthy\" (Tamil for \"The Emperor of Cine Music\") title on him in August 2012 and presented him with 60 gold coins and a new car.\n\nViswanathan composed film music together with composer and violinist T. K. Ramamoorthy from the 1950s to 1965, as Viswanathan–Ramamoorthy for 100 Films.\n\nM S Viswanathan was born on 24 June 1928 to Manayangath Subramanian and Narayani (\"Narayanikutty\" or \"Naanikutty\") in Elappully village in Palakkad, Kerala, India (Then in Malabar district, Madras province, British India). His father died when Viswanathan was four years old, and his mother decided to kill him, his sister and herself as an escape from abject poverty and lack of support. He was saved at the last minute by his grandfather. His grandfather Krishnan Nair was a warden at the central jail of Kannur. After death of his father, his family moved from Palakkad to Kannur to stay with his jailor uncle. As a child, he sold refreshments in a movie theatre without any pay, so he could listen to the music in the films. He had a part in the film \"Kannagi\" produced by Jupiter Pictures.\n\nHis primary education was at Pallikunnu, Kannur. He would often play truant from school and stand outside the house of Neelakanta Bhagavathar, a local music teacher, and listen to his teaching other students. He learnt to play the harmonium, and Neelakanta Bhagavathar, who heard him play and sing on a Vijayadasami Day, was impressed and organised a three-hour concert at the Kannur town hall. He later gave his first stage performance in Trivandrum at the age of 13. He worked as an office boy for Jupiter Pictures in the 1940s, earning Rs 3 per month.\n\nViswanathan was married to Janaki and they have four sons and three daughters, none of them who professed their father's talent. His wife, Janaki, died on 14 May 2012. She was 77 when she died.\n\nHe is known to have looked after his original Guru, S.M.Subbaiah Naidu, when the latter fell into financial difficulties and then continued to look after his wife until her death.As a rare human approach, M. S. Viswanathan, looked after his friend J. P. Chandrababu, the great Comedian and Singer of Tamil films, when the latter fell into financial ruins. Chandrababu stayed the last few years of his life in the house of M. S. Viswanathan, and as per the request of Chandrababu, MSV arranged his rites when he died in March 1974.\n\nViswanathan had always wanted to be an actor and singer, but was not successful. He had a few small roles in stage dramas in the 1940s. The composer and violinist T. R. Papa met Viswanathan, took a liking to him and arranged a job for him as an errand boy for S. V. Venkatraman's musical troupe in 1942. In that company of musicians, Viswanathan realised that he had the inclination and the potential for composing music. He thereafter joined S. M. Subbaiah Naidu and at times assisted him. He then joined C. R. Subburaman's musical troupe as a harmonium player. Here, he met T. K. Ramamoorthy and T. G. Lingappa, the two leading violinists at that time. T. G. Lingappa also became a renowned music composer on his own in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1952, C. R. Subburaman died unexpectedly. Ramamoorthy and Viswanathan joined together and completed the background music for the films Subburaman was working on, including \"Devadas\", \"Chandirani\" and \"Marumagal\". N. S. Krishnan knew them both fairly intimately and also their respective talents by then because of his close relationship with C.R.Subburaman, with whom he had worked earlier in several films. Meanwhile, Viswanathan also worked as the third composer for the film \"Genova\" where the other composers were M.S Gnanamani and T.K.Kalyanam. M.G.Ramachandran, the hero of the film Genova, had reservations about the 'raw, young music director' but the reservations lasted only till he listened to the songs. M.G.Ramachandran instantly recognised the arrival of a genius and the relationship lasted till the end of his career as a hero in 1977. Viswanathan and Ramamoorthy were asked to write the music for \"Panam\", a 1952 film produced by \"A. L. Seenivasan\" and directed by N. S. Krishnan. Later the duo was asked to do the background score for the film \"Ratha Kanneer\" by its music composer C. S. Jayaraman.\n\nThe duo composed music for over 100 films, and they worked together from 1952 to 1965.\n\nOn 16 June 1963 at a special function M. S. Viswanathan and T. K. Ramamoorthy were each given the title of \"Mellisai Mannar\"(Kings of the Light Music). It was granted by Sivaji Ganesan at the Madras Triplicane Cultural Academy. The function was supported and facilitated by the Hindu Group of Publications, especially Mr. T. M. Ramachandran, Director C. V. Sridhar and Chitralaya Gopu.\n\nThe duo parted in 1965 after release of \"Ayirathil Oruvan\" and since then they composed for films individually. After 29 years, they rejoined in 1995 for the Tamil film \"Engirundho Vanthan\" starring Sathyaraj.\n\nP. Susheela received her first National Award as Best Singer in 1969 for the song \"Paal Polave\" composed by MSV in the film Uyarndha Manidhan. Immediately after recording the song, MSV was so happy, he said to P. Susheela that she would be acclaimed as the Best Singer for the National Award for this song.\n\nThe duo Viswanathan Ramamoorthy were awarded an honorary doctorate by the Sathyabama Deemed University in September 2006.\n\nJ. Jayalalithaa, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, conferred the title \"Thirai Isai Chakravarthy\" (Emperors of the Cine Music) on Viswanathan and Ramamoorthy in August 2012 and presented them with 60 gold coins and a new car.\n\nViswanathan Ramamoorthy duo were the first musicians to arrange a stage performance of the film singers and live orchestra in India. Until then only traditional Carnatic music and Hindustani classical music was performed live in any function. This became a trend setter and paved the way not only for the birth of many musical troops, but also for knowing, understanding and learning about the western instruments among millions of Indians.\n\nM. S. Viswanathan began his solo career in 1965. Viswanathan is known for having incorporated various genres of world music into Indian cinema music. He used elements such as humming and whistling in his songs, and blended new trends such as western music and disco with Indian classical tunes.

Viswanathan also scored music for many non-film albums and for political campaigns.\n\nHe also did playback singing, including 500 songs composed by himself and over 200 songs composed by music directors. He performed songs such as Sollathan Ninaikiren, Inbathilum Thunbathilun Sirithidu Magaley, Yenakkoru Kaathalai Irukindral, Sangamam and Vidaikodu Engal Nadey.\n\nViswanathan worked with many different film directors, including B. R. Panthulu, S. S. Vasan, B. S. Ranga, and Krishnan-Panju in the 1950s, and in later decades with C. V. Sridhar, A. Bhimsingh, Madhavan, T. R. Ramanna, A. C. Trilogchander, K. Shankar, K. Balachander, Muktha Srinivasan, Chitralaya Gopu, Cho Ramaswamy, and K. S. Gopalakrishnan from the 1960s. From the 1970s directors such as S. P. Muthuraman, Major Sundarrajan, Bhagyaraj, D. Yoganand, C. V. Rajendran, P. Madhavan, K. S. Prakash Rao, Vietnam Veedu Sundaram, N. T. Rama Rao, and I. V. Sasi frequently worked with Vishwanathan; later, in the 1980s and 1990s, new directors such as Visu, Mouli, Komal Swaminathan, and K. Raghunath collaborated with Viswanathan regularly.\n\nHe worked with a number of singers, both younger artists and more established ones, including, P. Susheela, L. R. Eswari, T. M. Soundararajan, and the Malayalam singer Jayachandran. He is also considered responsible for making singers like S. P. Balasubrahmanyam and Vani Jairam, R. Balasaraswathi, S. Janaki, A. L. Raghavan, Sirkazhi Govindarajan and K. J. Yesudas popular names. He gave Swarnalatha her first job as a playback singer when she was 14 years old. MSV has given great life by giving opportunity and support for many musicians, lyricists, singers etc. Lyricist Vaali quoted in 1984, \"Until I met Viswanathan Sir, I had no money to have any food. But from the moment I met Viswanathan Sir I had no time to have food\".\n\nM. S. Vishwanathan went on to act in Tamil feature films, notably appearing in Kaadhal Mannan after being convinced to do so by actor [[Vivek (actor)|and Director Saran while he also starred in Kamal Haasan's \"Kaathala Kaathala\" and Karthik's \"Rojavanam\". He also made appearances in other films and television series since 1995.\n\nSince 1996, Viswanathan focused on composing devotional music and serving as a judge in Malayalam and Tamil TV reality shows.

It features works of famous Danish designers like Arne Jacobsen, Jacob Jensen and Kaare Klint, who was one of the two architects who remodeled the former Frederiks Hospital (built 1752–57) into a museum in the 1920s. The exhibition also features a variety of Chinese and German porcelain.\n\nThe museum houses the biggest library for design in Scandinavia. It also hosts a fully annotated and illustrated database of all furniture made in Denmark from 1900 to 2000, originally compiled by Reese and Marilyn Palley and later donated to and further developed by the museum.\n\nThe museum was founded in 1890 at the initiative of, among others, Industriforeningen. A purpose-built building designed by Vilhelm Klein and located next to Industriforeningen's premises on City Hall Square was completed in 1894 and opened to the public the following year. The exhibitions were housed in separate galleries, each dedicated to a particular field such as porcelain, faience, silver, furniture, glass and textiles. This arrangement reflected the primary aim of the museum which was to serve as a source of inspiration for craftsmen and manufacturers by highlighting the very best in craftsmenship and design from different ages.\n\nIn 1926 the museum moved to its current building, the defunct Frederick's Hospital from 1757, a gift from the banker Emil Glückstadt. The architects Kaare Klint and Ivar Bentsen had undertaken the necessary alterations and furnishings.\n\nThe museum is home to the largest library in Scandinavia dedicated to decorative arts and industrial design. Open to the general public, the library is at once a museum library, research library, and Danish central library within its field. Opening hours are Tuesday–Friday from 11–17. The library contains more than 1,000 journals. The latest issues of the 75 journals and magazines which the museum subscribes to can be read in the library's reading room.\n\nThe reading room of the library hosts public lectures on design-related topics which draw upon the collections in both the museum and the library.\n\nThe Danish Design Archive and the Poster Collection are located on the museum's first floor.\n\nThe museum has a small auditorium on the first floor seating 120 people.

{"id": "2088905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2088905", "title": "No More Drama", "text": "No More Drama\n\nNo More Drama is the fifth studio album by American R&B recording artist Mary J. Blige. The album was released by MCA on August 28, 2001.\n\nFollowing the critical and commercial success of her fourth studio album \"Mary\" (1999), \"No More Drama\" was similarly well-received. It debuted at number two on the US \"Billboard\" 200 and at number one on the R&B Albums chart, selling 324,000 copies in its first week. It has spawned four singles that have attained \"Billboard\" chart success, including its lead single \"Family Affair\", which became Blige's first career number-one single on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and a worldwide number-one hit.\n\nThe album received two Grammy Award nominations for Best R&B Album and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance (for \"Family Affair\") at the 44th Grammy Awards. Blige would win her first in the latter category for the track \"He Think I Don't Know\" the following year. As of December 2016, the album has been certified triple platinum for shipping over three million copies in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nThe inspiration for \"No More Drama\" came largely from Blige's own confused and hectic life. In a later interview she confessed to living a life of alcohol and drug abuse at the time, and as a result getting involved in a series of abusive relationships. The album was an attempt to break free from this vicious circle, which was a result of a deprived childhood.\n\nStylistically, the album diverged from Blige's typically blues-soaked R&B into the hip-hop beats and influences that had made her debut, 1992's \"What's the 411?\", a hit. This is especially evident in the first single, \"Family Affair\". Rapper Eve appears on the track \"Where I've Been\" as well, and urban influences can be heard throughout the album.\n\nEarly in its development, the album carried the full title Mary Jane - No More Drama and was to be a sequel to 1999's \"Mary\". Blige's then-manager hinted that the album would be the second in a trilogy and be followed by an album titled Mary Jane Blige. During this time, the first single was supposed to be a song called \"Rock Steady\" featuring a rap from Jay-Z and Lenny Kravitz on guitar. The song was leaked to mixtapes around June 2001, two months before the album was scheduled to be released and subsequently did not make the final cut on the album.\n\nThe original advance copy of \"No More Drama\" was slightly different from the later, official release. A vocal loop repeated throughout the whole of the version included with the intention of anti-piracy sings \"Mary J. Blige, No More Drama!\". The first publish of an AMG review printed in All Music Guide to Soul, a guide to R&B and soul, of \"No More Drama\" mistakenly pointed this out as if it were part of the actual album, calling it \"as subtle and congruent as a consistent drum hit.\"\n\n\"No More Drama\" received generally positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 77, based on 12 reviews. AllMusic editor Liana Jonas complimented Blige's ability to write relatable lyrics, writing that she \"has a killer instinct for creating gritty, thick, and soul-infused R&B fare. Her music is more than heard. It is felt, and audiences would be hard-pressed to not surrender to her groove.\" Writing for \"The A.V. Club\", Nathan Rabin believed \"Blige sounds happier and more relaxed than ever. Boasting nearly as many producers as songs, \"No More Drama\" [is] a testament to Blige's force of personality and the authenticity of her vision that the disc feels as personal and intimate as the most heartfelt four-track demo.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\"s David Browne felt that \"from the Dre-produced theatricality of the single ”Family Affair” to refined funk and crisp quiet-storm R&B, the multi-producer arrangements are expansive yet warm, and Blige's pushy rasp has never sounded better.\" Robert Marriott from \"Rolling Stone\" said the record \"presents Blige more in touch with her roots, more grounded and ready for her next set of challenges, musical and otherwise, an analog soul thriving in a digital age.\" Barry Walters from \"The Village Voice\" called it \"Blige's most rhythm album ever, and even the ballads that can drag r&b down here bristle with bumping beats.\"\n\nThe newspaper's Robert Christgau was somewhat less enthusiastic, finding the record \"front-loaded\", highlighting the songs \"PMS\" and \"Steal Away\" while writing \"positive attitude's a bitch, not to mention a drag\". Ethan Brown was unimpressed by Blige's more optimistic songs, writing in \"New York\" magazine that, \"miserable, Blige can be penetrating and profound; happy, she comes off generic and bland.\"\n\n\"No More Drama\" debuted and peaked at number two on the \"\"Billboard\" 200\", the official albums chart in the United States, on September 6, 2001 – second only to Aaliyah's self-titled third album. The album sold 294,351 units in its first week of release. \"No More Drama\" was Blige's highest debut week album sales, until it was surpassed by \"The Breakthrough\" (2005), which sold 729,000 copies in its first week. By the end of 2001, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and became the seventy-third best-selling album of that year in the United States. The album's commercial performance was reinforced by the subsequent release of a reissue. The release of the special edition helped \"No More Drama\" to re-enter the top ten in February 2002, gaining more than 200 percent in sales at a total of 61,000 copies. The same month, \"No More Drama\" was certified double platinum by the RIAA. As of August 2003, the album has sold 1.9 million copies in the US, while the special edition moved an additional 1.1 million units.\n\nIn Germany, the album was her most successful one in her career in this country, reaching #13 and staying in the German Albums Chart for 35 weeks \nEstimated worldwide sales for the album are at 6,500,000.\n\n"}

Pathmanabha (Padmanaba), Douglas Devananda, Suresh Premachandran and Varatharajah Perumal as a breakaway faction of the Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students.\n\nIn 1982 the EPRLF formed a military wing, \"People's Liberation Army\", headed by Douglas Devananda. The PLA is believed to have received military training by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.\n\nIn early 1986 disputes amongst the EPRLF leadership led to it splitting into two factions: \"EPRLF (Ranjan)\" and \"EPRLF (Douglas)\".\n\nIn late 1986 the Tamil Tigers attacked the EPRLF, inflicting heavy losses. Many of its cadres were killed or taken prisoner and its camps and weapons were seized by the Tigers. Douglas Devananda was blamed for the debacle.\n\nIn 1987 the \"EPRLF (Douglas)\" faction formally split from the EPRLF. It initially formed the Eelam National Democratic Liberation Front with a breakaway faction of the People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam led by Paranthan Rajan, but later transformed itself into the Eelam People's Democratic Party.\n\nAfter its military defeat by the Tamil Tigers the EPRLF transformed itself into political party and allied itself with the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) who were occupying much of Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka.\n\nThe EPRLF's first foray into politics came in the flawed 1988 provincial council elections. With the assistance of IPKF the EPRLF secured 41 of the 71 seats on the North Eastern Provincial Council. On 10 December 1988 Varatharajah Perumal became the first Chief Minister of the North Eastern Provincial Council.\n\nThe EPRLF formed an alliance with the Eelam National Democratic Liberation Front, Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization and Tamil United Liberation Front to contest the 1989 parliamentary elections. The alliance won 188,593 votes (3.40%), securing 10 of the 225 seats in Parliament. 7 of the 10 alliance MPs were from the EPRLF.\n\nOn 1 March 1990, just as the IPKF were preparing to withdraw from Sri Lanka, Varatharajah Permual moved a motion in the North Eastern Provincial Council declaring an independent Eelam. President Premadasa reacted to Permual's UDI by dissolving the provincial council and imposing direct rule on the province. The EPRLF's leadership fled to Madras (now Chennai), India.\n\nOn 19 June 1990 the Tamil Tigers attacked an EPRLF meeting in Madras, murdering thirteen EPRLF members including leader K. Padmanaba, Jaffna District MP G. Yogasangari and former North Eastern Province Finance Minister P. Kirubakaran.\n\nIn 1997, after the Sri Lankan military had recaptured the Jaffna peninsula from the Tamil Tigers, the EPRLF re-opened its Jaffna office. It took part in the 1998 local elections held in the peninsula and was able to win 13,140 votes (14.35%), winning 25 seats across 11 local councils.\n\nThe party broke into two factions in 1999 when its General Secretary Kandaiah \"Suresh\" Premachandran made a deal with the Tamil Tigers. The majority of the party formed the \"EPRLF (Varathar) wing\" under the leadership of Varatharajah Perumal whilst the rest formed the \"EPRLF (Suresh) wing\" under the leadership of Suresh Premachandran. Crucially Suresh had control of most of the EPRLF's assets as well as its name (as registered with the Sri Lankan Department of Elections).\n\nThe \"Suresh wing\" joined other pro-Tamil Tiger parties in 2001 to form the Tamil National Alliance (TNA).\n\nThe \"Varathar wing\" has restyled itself as the \"Padmanaba wing\", after its murdered leader. It is registered as a political party with the Sri Lankan Department of Elections under the name of \"Padmanaba Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front\". In 2008 it joined with other anti-Tamil Tiger parties to form the Tamil Democratic National Alliance (later restyled Democratic Tamil National Alliance) to contest provincial and local elections.\n\nThe wing's de facto leader (Varatharajah Perumal is in exile in India) Kandiah \"Robert\" Subathiran was murdered on 14 June 2003. The wing's current General Secretary (and de facto leader) is Thirunavukkarasu Sritharan (Sridharan).\n\nThere have been repeated allegations that various factions of the EPRLF, despite their claim to have given up violence, operate armed wings which have worked with the IPKF and Sri Lankan Army. A group composed of former EPRLF cadres known as \"Razeek Group\" works along with the Sri Lankan Army as a paramilitary group in activities against the Tamil Tigers in the Batticaloa region. They have also been accused of indulging in massacres, kidnappings and torture \n\n"}
{"id": "2088910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2088910", "title": "Passenger terminal (maritime)", "text": "Passenger terminal (maritime)\n\nA passenger terminal is a structure in a port which services passengers boarding and leaving water vessels such as ferries, cruise ships and ocean liners. Depending on the types of vessels serviced by the terminal, it may be named (for example) ferry terminal, cruise terminal, marine terminal or maritime passenger terminal. As well as passengers, a passenger terminal sometimes has facilities for automobiles and other land vehicles to be picked up and dropped off by the water vessel.\n\nPassenger terminals may vary greatly in size. A small ferry terminal servicing a commuter ferry may just have the means to tie up the vessel and a waiting area for passengers. Even for a large, vehicle-carrying cross-sea ferry, the terminal at a small island location may be similar sized, with just a short ramp to enable vehicles to be driven onto the ferry.\n\nPassengers may be loaded onto a ship from the wharf by a gangway or by a linkspan. Goods packed in containers may be driven onto the vessel by a vehicle which then detaches itself from the container and returns to shore.\n\nIf the passenger terminal handles vehicles (which is common especially in cross-sea ferry terminals), it will usually have the facilities, such as appropriate markings on the ground, to enable the vehicles to line up in an orderly manner. Vehicles may be driven off the ship directly, if the vessel is a Roll-on/roll-off ship. \n\nPassenger terminals in large ports usually have passenger facilities comparable with medium-sized airports, including waiting areas, ticketing desks, luggage deposit and retrieval areas, and food, beverage and other retail outlets. Ferry terminals for international ferries, such as those crossing between the United Kingdom and continental Europe, also have customs and immigration inspection facilities and security control areas similar to an international airport.\n\nHistorically, the largest passenger terminals were located in major coastal cities servicing large ocean liners. With the demise of most ocean liners in the later half of the 20th century and the rise of cruise ship tourism in its stead, the largest passenger terminals today are those in \"cruise home ports\". In addition to extensive facilities to service passengers, these terminals must also be capable of handling the large amount of supplies required by large cruise ships and ocean liners.\n\nMajor passenger ports (such as the Port of Southampton) tend to have numerous docks and wharves, some with multiple berths, in order to handle more than one ship simultaneously. Some ports use a single, large passenger terminal to service multiple docks, while others have multiple terminal buildings, each servicing a dock or wharf, so that passengers can board vessels directly from the terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2088911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2088911", "title": "Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization", "text": "Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization\n\nThe Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) is an Eelam Tamil organisation campaigning for the establishment of an independent Tamil Eelam in the northeast of Sri Lanka. The TELO was originally created as a militant group, and functioned as such until 1986, when most of its membership was killed in a conflict with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Its surviving members reorganised themselves as a political party, and it continues to function as such today.\n\nThe TELO currently has two Members of Parliament. It is part of the Tamil National Alliance, a coalition of Tamil parties which won 2.9% of the popular vote and 14 out of 225 seats at the 2010 parliamentary election in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe TELO evolved out of the group of Tamil student radicals formed by Nadarajah Thangathurai and Selvarajah Yogachandran (better known by his nom de guerre \"Kuttimani\") in the late 1960s. The group formally constituted itself into an organisation in 1979, inspired in part by the LTTE and the Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students (EROS). Soon, it had become the most effective of the Tamil militant groups except the LTTE.\n\nIts success did not last long, however. Both Thangathurai and Kuttimani were captured by the Sri Lankan Army in 1981 while they were in the process of escaping to India. For a while after their arrest, the TELO was led by Sri Sabaratnam as the de facto leader.\n\nThe TELO was thereafter relatively dormant until 1983. On 25 July 1983, both Thangathurai and Kuttimani were brutally tortured and killed in a prison riot by Sinhalese prisoners. Sri Sabaratnam then became its head. The trained cadre would be supplied with weaponry, and sent to Sri Lanka to wage a guerrilla war against the army.\n\nIn February 1984, the TELO together with the EROS and the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) set up a common militant front for the Eelam struggle, which was called the Eelam National Liberation Front, or ENLF. The LTTE joined the ENLF in April that year. In co-ordination, the groups began carrying out attacks against government positions in Jaffna. The TELO used its arms to destroy the main police station in Jaffna, and attack military convoys. The combined assaults led to the near-total disappearance of government authority in Jaffna.\n\nAs a leader, however, Sri Sabaratnam lacked the charisma which the likes of Prabhakaran had, and he was unable to convey the sense of vision to the TELO which the LTTE had. As a result, the TELO's rapid growth was not backed up by a strong ideology like the LTTE's had been, and a number of its cadre were seen as bullies. Sri Sabaratnam, relying heavily on his association with and support by India, had not acquired the sort of advanced modern weaponry that the LTTE had, and the group therefore began losing its effectiveness. A number of TELO members became unhappy with Sri Sabaratnam's leadership, and dissension grew in the ranks. By 1985, a number of factions had emerged in the TELO. The rivalry between the factions led to the murder of Dass, one of the factional leaders, in April 1986. This led to a split in the organisation, with several dozen members leaving.\n\nIn the meantime, differences with the LTTE were also growing. The LTTE was unhappy with the pro-India stance of the TELO. They also were upset that the TELO was getting by far the largest share of contributions from Sri Lankan Tamil expatriates, even though the TELO was not as active or successful as the LTTE. Prabhakaran also feared that India would use the TELO to have him killed.\n\nMatters came to a head with the assassination of two prominent Tamil politicians in Jaffna, M. Alalasundaram and V. Dharmalingam, in September 1985. The TELO and the LTTE blamed each other for the killings. In February 1986, the LTTE pulled out of the ENLF. On 29 April that year, they launched an all-out assault on the TELO. TELO bases across Jaffna were shelled with mortars. TELO cadres, whether armed or unarmed, came under rifle attack and were shot dead. No quarter was given, according to eyewitnesses. Those who surrendered were shot dead as they laid down their weapons, and those who attempted to flee were shot as they ran. Civilians were warned not to shelter fugitives. The few TELO cadres who managed to find refuge with other armed groups such as the EPRLF or the EROS were nearly the only ones who survived. On 5 May, the TELO's leader Sri Sabaratnam was shot dead by Kittu (Sathasivam Krishnakumar) of the LTTE. In all, over four hundred men had been killed, and the TELO had been virtually wiped out.\n\nThe LTTE at the time justified its actions as necessary, arguing that the TELO was being used by India to infiltrate the Eelam struggle and reshape it to its own ends. Several years later, however, in 1990, Kittu, who had directed and led the massacres, admitted that it had been a mistake to kill the cadres of the TELO, although the assassination of the top leaders was justified.\n\nSome attempts were made during the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) period to revive the TELO as a militant group, and to avenge those killed by the LTTE. They were assisted by the Indian Army, which armed them and used them to try to contain the LTTE, who opposed the IPKF presence. However, they came under constant LTTE attack and suffered heavy casualties, losing as many as 70 in a single attack in September 1987. Once the IPKF withdrew, the military strength of these groups melted away, with most of their members surrendering to the LTTE in fear of reprisals. Since then, the TELO has never revived as an effective militant group.\n\nAfter the killing of Sri Sabaratnam, Selvam Adaikalanathan became the leader of the TELO. Following the melting away of its cadre after the IPKF's withdrawal, he decided that the TELO would never recover and therefore eventually reconstituted it as a political party.\n\nTELO formed an alliance with the Eelam National Democratic Liberation Front, EPRLF and Tamil United Liberation Front to contest the 1989 parliamentary elections. The alliance won 188,593 votes (3.40%), securing 10 of the 225 seats in Parliament. 2 of the 10 alliance MPs were from TELO.\n\nTELO formed an alliance with EROS and People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam to contest the 1994 parliamentary elections. The alliance won 38,028 votes (0.48%), securing 3 of the 225 seats in Parliament. None of the 3 alliance MPs were from TELO.\n\nAt the 2000 parliamentary elections TELO contested on its own and won 26,112 votes (0.30%), securing 3 of the 225 seats in Parliament.\n\nThe TELO maintained an ambivalent position with relation to the LTTE for some years, but starting from the mid-1990s, it began to take an increasingly pro-LTTE stand. In 2001, it joined the Tamil National Alliance, a coalition of pro-independence Tamil parties, which supported, and was supported by, the LTTE. In an interview, Adaikkalanathan explained the contradiction behind the TELO supporting a group to which it was once opposed. While the TELO does not accept internecine killing and can never forget what the LTTE has done, he says it would be betraying the Tamil people to oppose the LTTE, because victory could only be achieved if all Tamil groups set aside their differences and present a united front.\n\n\n"}

According to the 2011 UK census, Wawne parish had a population of 975, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 878.\n\nWawne is first mentioned (as \"Wagene\") in the Domesday Book in 1086. The name is from an assumed Old English word \"wagen\", meaning \"shaking\" (probably connected with Modern English \"wag\" or the dialect \"quag\"), and is therefore believed to mean \"shaking ground\" or \"quagmire\".\n\nIn the early Middle Ages Wawne was a very large parish, including Sutton-on-Hull and Stoneferry. Sutton became a separate parish some time in the Middle Ages.\n\nIn 1155, Stephen the son of William, Earl of Aumale, confirmed that his father had made a gift of the Church of Wawne to the French abbey of St. Martin D’Auchy, Aumale in Normandy (Seine Maritime) and William for the first time, mentioned Wawne's dependent chapel of Sutton. However, in William also granted the church to the abbey at Meaux. The church was later in dispute and it was possibly because of these two conflicting grants. During the time of Thomas, Abbot of Meaux (1182–97), Aumale upheld its right to Wawne against Meaux's claim, and Meaux was obliged to offer the French abbey £6 13s. 4d. in order to enjoy the church and its chapel at Sutton; before eventually losing Wawne as the result of an exchange arranged by the Archbishop of York who reserved the church to his own use and annexed it to the chancellorship of York in 1230.\nAn alehouse at Wawne was first mentioned in the 1590s, and the Plough was named in 1666. Wawne and Meaux each had one or two licensed houses in the later 18th century, but only one was recorded from the 1820s, the Anchor, or Windham Arms, at the river crossing.\nThe Windham Arms remained open until March 1967. It was later used as a farmhouse. The Waggoners Arms, on Sutton Road, was opened in the 1970s and is still trading today. For a time the \"Waggoners\" became a Chinese restaurant which was noted for its bright orange roof. This easily identifies the village when viewed from the air by aircraft passing overhead on their way to Humberside Airport.\nThe Manor House in Wawne, home of the Ashe Windham family, was replaced by housing for the guards and other employees of Hull Prison. The parish church of St Peter was designated a Grade I listed building in 1968 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. A small brick building was provided by the Windhams as a reading room in 1900, and evidently so used until 1926, when a First World War wooden hut was erected adjoining the room for a village institute. That hut was later replaced by another, and in the later 1980s a new brick-built village hall was put up on the site. The former reading room next door was used for church meetings. A library was run in Wawne Village Institute by the county council.\nBefore its 20th-century growth, the village had a cricket field on the south side of Main Street. That was replaced by another pitch, laid out on 1½ a. on the north side of Ferry Road, bought in 1963; in 1971 the parish council enlarged the site by c. ½ a., and in turn made tennis courts and a children's play area there. A pavilion had been added by the 1980s.\nLand south-east of the church was bought in 1966 for a new vicarage but was later used instead for allotment gardens.\n\nThere was a ferry across the River Hull at least as early as the 12th century. In the 1820s the Windham Arms was kept by the ferryman. By the 1890s there was a punt for ferrying pedestrians and cyclists and a pontoon / chain ferry for farm machinery, for horse-drawn vehicles and farm animals. This was later used for cars, and drivers were charged sixpence or a shilling depending on the size of the vehicle. The opening of Sutton Road Bridge in Hull (1937) had a serious effect on Wawne Ferry because this was only three miles downstream. Drivers could use the new bridge for nothing but had to pay to use the ferry and were often delayed at the Thearne side of the river. The ferry continued in use during the Second World War but closed in August 1946 when the Windham Arms and the ferry rights were sold to Moors' and Robson's Brewery. They appointed Walter Twidale as their tenant and he reported that the ferry boat was no longer safe to use.\n\nAccess to the village is provided via Meaux Road. Wawne itself was effectively a cul-de-sac, with no through roads. However, since 2002 development between the Public House and the village has taken the place of the old run down garage site.\n\nThe developments, St. Peters Walk and Church Lane have provided the village with new housing and made a more attractive approach to the main village. Local volunteers have also arranged flowerbeds and farming antiquities around the street signs, further enhancing the overall look of the village.\n\nBoth Ferry Road and Greens Lane terminate at the River Hull, where there is no crossing to the small village of Thearne on the opposite bank - Ferry Road is where the ferry was until 1946.\n\nThe Post Office is situated on Main Street. Wawne County Primary School is located on Greens Lane and hosts an annual Fete in July.\n\nThe village was hit during the floods in June 2007, mainly in Oak Square, where a blocked drain caused water levels to rise two feet and about five houses were flooded. The rest of the village was safe from the rising waters, except for Meaux Road corner.\n\nWawne has strong historic connections to the neighbouring village of Sutton on Hull, just 2½ miles to the south east. In the early 12th century, villagers of the smaller hamlet of Sutton had to come to St Peter's Church in Wawne to attend mass and all feast days, this church then being ‘senior’ to the tiny chapel in Sutton. Thus baptisms, marriages and burials could only be carried out at St Peter's, until Sutton had its own newly built church of St James’ consecrated, in 1349, the year of the height of the Black Death.\n\nOver the centuries, there has been a great deal of connection and inter-marriage between both villages, and the Sutton & Wawne Museum is a local folk museum housed within the Old School in Sutton, with collections of many artefacts, documents and photographs of common interest to both parishes, including all the historic farms and fields in the areas now called Bransholme, Kingswood and Sutton Park, as well as Stoneferry and Wilmington. At the museum, volunteers also research local family history for visitors and residents of both parishes. Admission is free: open Fridays 10 am – 2 pm.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2088938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2088938", "title": "Eelam People's Democratic Party", "text": "Eelam People's Democratic Party\n\nThe Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDP) is a political party and a pro-government paramilitary organization in Sri Lanka. It is led by its founder Douglas Devananda.\n\nDouglas Devananda was one of the founding members of the Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students (EROS), one of the earliest Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups. In 1980 EROS split into two as K. Pathmanabha (Padmanaba) Varatharajah Perumal broke away and formed the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF). Devananda joined the EPRLF. By early 1986 disputes had arisen between Devananda and Pathmanabha, the EPRLF's political leader. The EPRLF leadership split into two factions: EPRLF (Ranjan) and EPRLF (Douglas). In 1987 the \"EPRLF (Douglas)\" faction formally split from the EPRLF. Devananda initially formed the Eelam National Democratic Liberation Front (ENDLF) with a breakaway faction of the People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam led by Paranthan Rajan. The ENDLF collapsed when Rajan started working with Indians - Devananda was opposed to the Indian intervention in the Sri Lankan Civil War. Devananda, now living in Madras, India, then formed the Eelam People's Democratic Party.\n\nThe EPDP lacked funds and Devananda resorted to kidnapping and extortion of Sri Lankan Tamils living in Madras. In 1989 Devananda and 25 others were arrested for the second time by the Indian police, this time for kidnapping a ten-year-old boy for ransom at Poonamallee High Road, Kilpauk, Madras, and imprisoned. He was given bail. In 1990 police in Kodambakkam, Madras, started an investigation on Devananda on charges of rioting and criminal intimidation of a person called Valavan. In 1990 Devananda jumped bail and returned to Sri Lanka.\n\nIn 1990 Devananda arrived in Colombo. A meeting was arranged by Sri Lankan intelligence between Devananda and Deputy Defence Minister Ranjan Wijeratne. Devananda offered to place the EPDP under Sri Lankan government control in return for support and protection from the Tamil Tigers. The government accepted - the EPDP had transformed itself into a paramilitary organisation. Devananda was attacked for betraying the Tamil people and collaborating with the enemy.\n\nEPDP cadres from all over Sri Lanka and India converged on Colombo. The government gave the EPDP vast financial assistance. The EPDP, with the support of the government, took control of the islands off Jaffna peninsula after the Tigers withdrew. The EPDP used the islands as a base to transport goods, particularly dried fish, between India and Sri Lanka. It also imposed taxes. Tamils living in Colombo were extorted money.\n\nOn 1 January 1993 Tharmalingam Selvakumar, a former EPDP sympathiser, was abducted from the Premil Sports Club at Kotahena, Colombo. Selvakumar has alleged that he was taken in a van driven by Devananda to Devananda's house at 121 Park Road, Colombo 5. He was detained along with other prisoners in cells at the back of Devananda's house. Selvakumar was tortured and the EPDP tried to extort money from his family.\n\nAll of this resulted in Devananda making a fortune.\n\nThe EPDP's paramilitary wing continues to operate, despite its claims to have given up violence. The paramilitary wing has been accused to have helped the Sri Lankan Navy commit massacre in places like Allaipiddy.\n\nDevananda and the EPDP entered electoral politics when it contested the 1994 parliamentary election as an independent group in Jaffna District. Most of the district was under Tamil Tiger control and so did not vote, allowing the EPDP win nine parliamentary seats with just 10,744 votes (0.14%), of which 9,944 votes came from the EPDP controlled Jaffna islands. The EPDP became an ally of President Chandrika Kumaratunga and her People's Alliance (PA) government.\n\nAt the 2000 parliamentary election the EPDP won 50,890 votes (0.59%), securing four of the 225 seats in Parliament. In October 2000 Kumaratunga appointed Devananda as Minister of Development, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of the North, and Tamil Affairs, North and East.\n\nAt the 2001 parliamentary election the EPDP won 72,783 votes (0.81%), securing two of the 225 seats in Parliament. Devananda lost his ministerial post following the change of government.\n\nAt the 2004 parliamentary election the EPDP won 24,955 votes (0.27%), securing one of the 225 seats in Parliament. Devananda was appointed as Minister of Agriculture, Marketing Development, Hindu Education Affairs, Tamil Language & Vocational Training Centres in North when the United People's Freedom Alliance, the successor to the PA, returned to power. He was appointed Minister for Social Service and Social Welfare by President Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2005. There are unproved allegations of corruption against Devananda.\n\nSince the end of the Sri Lankan civil war in May 2009 the EPDP has contested local and national elections under the UPFA banner rather than on its own. At the 2010 parliamentary election three EPDP members were elected on the UPFA ticket, all from Jaffna District.\n\n"}

{"id": "2088945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2088945", "title": "Supportive housing", "text": "Supportive housing\n\nSupportive housing is a combination of housing and services intended as a cost-effective way to help people live more stable, productive lives, and is an active \"community services and funding\" stream across the United States. Supportive housing is widely believed to work well for those who face the most complex challenges—individuals and families confronted with homelessness and who also have very low incomes and/or serious, persistent issues that may include substance use disorders (including alcoholism), mental health, HIV/AIDS, chronic illness, diverse disabilities (e.g., intellectual disabilities, mobility or sensory impairments) or other serious challenges to stable housing. Supportive housing can be coupled with such social services as job training, life skills training, alcohol and substance use disorder treatment, community support services (e.g., child care, educational programs, coffee claches), and case management to populations in need of assistance. Supportive housing is intended to be a pragmatic solution that helps people have better lives while reducing, to the extent feasible, the overall cost of care. As community housing, supportive housing can be developed as mixed income, scattered site housing not only through the traditional route of low income and building complexes.\n\nSupportive/ed housing has been widely researched in the field of psychiatric disabilities and psychiatric rehabilitation, based in part on housing and support principles from studies of leading community integration organizations nationally In addition, supportive/ed housing has been tied to national initiatives in supportive/ed living (usually developmental and intellectual disabilities) to cross-disability transfer and to national and international efforts on developing homes of one's own. Supported housing in the field of mental health is considered to be a critical component of a community support system which may involve supported education, supported or transitional employment, case management services, clubhouses, supported recreation and involvement of family and friends often translated into psychoeducational programs.\n\nAs a widely supported means to address homelessness (i.e., lack of a place to live or adequate housing), supportive housing seeks to address two key problems:\nIn the capacity building context, support services can be integral to maintaining the housing, the tenant or cooperative relationships, the financial and economic security, the contribution to the family and neighborhoods, and the growth opportunities to return to a valued life situation.\nIn the 21st Century, supported/ive housing is linked to affordable housing (\"affordable housing crisis\") which affects communities throughout the US. The 1990 developments and creation of the term supportive/ed housing encompass models of community housing (\"and disability\") from the 1970s (e.g., first United Way mental health agency in New York) to new investments in new supported housing developments in the late 2000s (NYS Governor's Press release).\n\nSupportive housing encompasses a range of approaches including single sites (housing developments or apartment buildings in which units are designated as supportive housing) or scattered site programs in which participants often use rent subsidies to obtain housing from private landlord and supportive services may be provided through home visits. Services in supportive housing are flexible and primarily focused on the outcome of housing stability. New approaches to supportive/ed housing include explorations of home ownership for people with disabilities, and a range of diverse consumer-directed, personal assistance and community support services focused on community integration and support. Most common, however, with collaborations involving state, federal and local governments and non-profit sectors are congregate housing programs with service enhancements and increasing choices.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2007, an estimated 65,000 to 72,000 units of supportive housing were created in the United States. This represents about half the supply of supported housing units. Of the new units added, about half were targeted towards chronically homeless individuals, and one-fifth were for homeless families. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the number of Permanent Supportive Housing beds in the U.S. increased from 188,636 to 353,800 between 2007 and 2017. Although of the shelter population, the majority remain as single, adult males of minority groups (approximately 65%), 38% were between 31 and 50 years old, and 38% had a disability; the rest were homeless families with a high concentration (likely due to high housing costs)in the states of California, New York and Florida.\n\nSponsors of supportive housing projects generally aim to serve a specific population; the characteristics of those served and the housing program range widely: However, supporters of regular housing and support services in the community suggest choice based on other personal, social, and situational factors than specific population basis (e.g., choice of roommates or housemates, neighborhoods they live in). Targeted population groups (homeless initiatives) include:\n\nToday, important new populations for supported housing in regular neighborhoods include working families, especially those with high proportional housing costs, older adults who need intensive (enriched) services to avoid nursing home placements, and people who need places to live due to the closure of the old style, institutional psychiatric care. Increasingly, supportive/ed housing may be required as unemployment increases, for newly emerging groups such as newly legalized gay and lesbian partners, multi-generational immigrant groups in the new multicultural world, and for those adolescents aging out of their parents' homes to new community options. One of the 2000s textbooks on Supported/ive Housing is a report on state projects in the US for older adults which includes use of the home and community-based (HCBS) waiver, efforts to reform more than 43 congregate residential categories in states, use of housing subsidies for low income persons, assisted living options, \"comprehensive case/care management\", and technical area such as \"at-risk\" housing and non-profit development (Pynoos et al., 2004).\n\nSupportive Housing proposes to be a comprehensive solution to a problem rather than a band-aid fix (such as a shelter.) While many of those who stay in the shelter system remain in or return to the system for extended periods of time, a much higher percentage of those who are placed in supportive housing remain housed on a more permanent basis. This idea is also referred to as the Housing First model, an approach to combating chronic homelessness by providing homes upfront and offering help for illnesses and addictions. The concept turns the traditional model, which typically requires sobriety (or prerequisites) (which can be used for enhanced services before a person can get housing, upside down.\n\nResearch has shown that coupling permanent housing with supportive services is highly effective at maintaining housing stability, as well as helps improve health outcomes and decreases the use of publicly funded institutions. A review of the impact of these services found that they can improve health outcomes among chronically homeless individuals, including positive changes in self-reported mental health status, substance use, and overall well-being. In the Collaborative Initiative to Help End Chronic Homelessness (CICH), participants who had been homeless for an average of eight years were immediately placed into permanent housing. The CICH evaluation reported that 95% of those individuals were in independent housing after 12 months. A study of homeless people in New York City with serious mental illness found that providing supportive housing to the individuals directly resulted in a 60% decrease in emergency shelter use for clients, as well as decreases in the use of public medical and mental health services and city jails and state prisons. Another study in Seattle in 2009 found that moving \"people with chronic alcoholism\" into supportive housing resulted in a 33% decline in alcohol use for clients.\n\nThere is significant support for the contention that supportive housing also costs less than other systems where its tenant base may reside, such as jails, hospitals, mental health facilities, and even shelters. Research on the overall costs to the taxpayer of supportive housing has consistently found the costs to the taxpayer to be about the same or lower than the alternative of a chronically homeless person sleeping in a shelter. The CICH evaluation showed that average costs for healthcare and treatment were reduced by about half, which the largest decline associated with inpatient hospital care. The use of supportive housing has been shown to be cost-effective, resulting in reductions in the use of shelter, ambulance, police/jail, health care, emergency room, behavior health, and other service costs. For example, one 2016 report identified studies documenting that these services can reduce health care costs, emergency department visits, and length of stays in psychiatric hospitals. The Denver Housing First Collaborative documented that the annual cost of supportive housing for a chronically homeless individual was $13,400. However, the per-person reduction in public services recorded by the Denver Housing First Collaborative came to $15,773 per person per year, more than compensating for the annual supportive housing costs.\n\nWhen paired with low-income housing (or mixed-income housing), government subsidies (such as section 8 or Housing choice vouchers) and other revenue generating operations, supportive housing residences are claimed by their supporters to be capable of supporting themselves and even turning a profit (which can be used for enhanced services and amenities for the residents by a non-profit organization). According to a 2007 study done by the National Alliance to End Homelessness, supportive housing helps tenants increase their incomes, work more, get arrested less, make more progress toward recovery, and become more active, valued and productive members of their communities.\n\nSupportive housing can help people facing health challenges to continue to live in the community. However, proposals for new housing projects often faced local opposition, largely based on fears regarding adverse effects on property values and crime rates, local businesses, and the quality of life in the surrounding neighborhood. A 2008 study in Toronto, Canada reported:\n\nOne of the benefits of supportive/ed housing which is integrated into the community is that local opposition and fears are minimized. Neighborhoods have been studied as part of the development of community support, and as places for the development of personal connections and neighborhood relations. In addition, a capacity-based approach to neighborhood development can be made integral to the development of supportive/ed housing, including aspects of neighborhood asset building. In many ways, these projects can be a return to neighborhood based control of services' planning which resulted in the 1990s in new housing developments, after school programs, parent support groups, respite care and similar initiatives in the field of children's mental health,\n\nPrevailing rental rates and prices for housing in many U.S. real estate markets complicate efforts to acquire and adapt existing buildings and building sites for use as supportive housing. The combination of circumstances confronting supportive housing proposals and their advocates can produce the belief that most such housing proposals are unfeasible.\n\nSome projects fail to materialize because of a real or perceived lack of government program funds, charitable grants, bank loans or a combination of such funding to pay for the cost of creating and operating financially viable supportive housing. Other organizations, however, have accessed diverse mix and match funding for highly visible community demonstrations for special population groups.\n\nEnterprise Community Partners is one of many nonprofit organizations that finances supportive housing through tax credits, grants and loans. They pioneered the financing of supportive housing through the low-income housing tax credit in 1991, overturning the conventional wisdom that investors would not embrace these projects. Consultants specialize in the creative use of housing financing, and supportive housing consultants and technical assistance collaboratives are now available for assistance to localities.\n\nEarly directions for financing of housing and support services in the community included financing sources, such as housing cooperative programs, mixed income housing associations, community development block grants, loans for accessibility programs, tax exempt bonds, trust funds, housing subsidies, and low interest loans. The housing communities and institutes in the US, as early as the early 1980s, included Institute for Community Economics, McAuley Institute, Women's Institute for Housing and Economic Development, Habitat for Humanity, the Housing Technical Assistance Project of the ARCs, Local Support Corporation (LISC), University of Vermont (Center for Community Change through Housing and Support), Creative Management Associates, Enterprise Foundation, and National Housing Coalition.\n\nThe US Department of Housing and Urban Development regularly makes available free information on housing financing and developments in the US through their website, including \"Research Works\" (in 2011, also on sustainability and green initiatives) and \"US Housing Market Conditions\". Specific technical resources are available to providers and researchers such as on Section 8 or housing vouchers (portable vouchers) \n\nWhere traditional solutions—institutions, charitable organizations or other methods—are recognized as inadequate solutions for the situation, national, regional and local officials have come to believe that homelessness is a problem that can and should be solved by other means. In some areas, this produced a movement to find alternative solutions rather than continuing to fund the traditional solutions, including shelter system, jails, asylums and hospitals. In addition to homelessness, the movement today is to downsize or close psychiatric centers (e.g., Olmstead initiative) and develop regular options for housing and support in the local communities; these population groups have also been counted in some reports as the homeless populations.\n\nIn the U.S., hundreds of city governments have produced \"10-year plans\" that provide for supportive housing to end chronic homelessness because the Bush administration began pushing for creation of the plans in 2003. The goal: put the homeless people with complex situations and needs into permanent or transitional \"supportive\" housing with counseling services that help them get healthy lifestyles of their own choosing. The evidence shows supportive housing may be a viable solution: the number of street people in cities across the United States has plummeted for the first time since the 1980s. In 2005–2006, Miami, Florida reported a 20% decline in homeless populations and dozens of other U.S. cities reported similar census results: San Francisco, CA (30%), Portland, OR (20%), Dallas, TX (28%), New York, NY (13%).\n\nGuided by research, Congress has taken several steps to encourage the development of permanent supportive housing. Beginning in the late 1990s, appropriations bills have increased funding for HUD's homeless assistance programs and targeted at least 30 percent of funding to permanent supportive housing. Congress has also provided funding to ensure that permanent supportive housing funded by one of HUD's programs (Shelter Plus Care) would be renewed non-competitively, helping to ensure that chronically homeless people could remain in their housing. The 2009 legislative mandate from the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act created bipartisan political support to adopt a collaborative approach to end homelessness. From this effort spawned the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness's Opening Doors Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness in 2010. With a focus on permanent supportive housing as a means of ending chronic homelessness, the plan outlines an interagency effort aligning mainstream housing, health, education, and human services.\n\nSeller's Markets: where demand exceeds the supply of permanent supportive housing, many housing providers can be selective when admitting tenants. While this can lead to an improved quality of life and a relatively high success rate for the most fortunate applicants, the unsuccessful homeless remain in unsatisfactory situations. To some extent, this problem is being addressed by \"first step\" programs aimed at preparing people for residency in permanent housing. Exclusionary practices always exist in the residential and housing fields, against human rights laws, however, there does remain lack of an affordable, accessible supply of housing the US, similar to the waiting lists for portable housing vouchers.\n\nOne impediment to the development of additional housing stock where it is otherwise needed, permissible and feasible is the lack of real estate acquisition, development & financing expertise in the government agencies and non-profit (non-governmental) organizations interested in serving those who need and want supportive housing. The US Housing and Urban Development Department is trying to bridge that information and knowledge gap with the availability of regular reports on market and housing conditions throughout the nation, and statistics on all kinds of housing developments (e.g., homeownership, multifamily structures).\n\nIn addition, there is a widening affordability gap in housing, especially with the lowest income households. \"Experts point to several factors contributing to this gap: erosion in the housing stock, high housing prices, a drop in real wages, a decline in middle wage jobs, increases in transportation costs, expensive development requirements, regulatory constraints, and insufficient housing assistance funds to meet the needs.\" \n\nStudies cited by supporters conclude that supportive housing is a cost-effective solution for the problems of several populations; it is substantially less costly than most alternatives used to address the problems of homeless people, including shelters, institutions and hospitals. Supportive Housing often reduces the cost of emergency services for health care provided by governmental and non-profit agencies. The \"chronically homeless\", the 10-20% who are continually on the street with addiction and mental problems impose heavy costs on their communities in hospital, jail and other services—hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece annually in some instances.\n\nPer a study published in JAMA in 2009, a supportive housing development called 1811 Eastlake saved taxpayers $4 million in the first year of operation alone, because these residents are now off the streets and out of emergency rooms and in a safe, steady and supportive living environment. The 1811 Eastlake study compared 95 Housing First participants, with 39 wait-list control members and found cost reductions of over 50 percent for the Housing First group. While it is not the first published evidence of the service use reductions and cost savings that permanent supportive housing interventions can provide, it is worth highlighting because the level of the cost savings – almost $30,000 per person per year after accounting for housing program costs – are greater than some seminal studies that have shown more modest cost offsets through permanent supportive housing. 1811 Eastlake provided assistance to homeless people with extensive health issues and still saw a savings of nearly $30,000 per tenant per year in publicly funded services, all while achieving improved housing and health outcomes.\n\nIn Oregon, Portland's Community Engagement Program provides housing and intensive services to homeless individuals with mental illness and addictions. The program reduced the cost of health care and incarcerations from $42,075 to $17,199. The investment in services and housing during the first year of enrollment was averaged to approximately $9,870. This represents a 35.7% ($15,006 per person) annual cost saving for the first year following enrollment in CEP.\n\nSupportive housing can be considered to be a human right to a decent life in the US. The cost-benefits can be viewed as immeasureable when viewed through the lenses of benefits to self, family, friends, neighbors, community organizations, health, safety and welfare (government), and local communities. For example, cost-benefits typically relate to governmental expenditures, which may involve cost-shifting among governmental levels and departments, and benefits usually refer to the governmental benefits related to its agenda (E.g., Deinstitutionalization, transinstitutionalization, decongregation, decategorization, Community integration) expressed for the individual and family as life outcomes.\n\nHowever, supportive housing, especially as assisted living, may be congregate in nature either related to hospital and nursing home systems reform on one hand (E.g., Pynoos et al., 2004), or in psychiatric, to its categorical disability service system with roots in community services systems and psychiatric hospitals (Racino, in press, 2014). In the field of intellectual disabilities, the term Supportive living is more common with decongregated, small size homes and apartments with choice options throughout local communities.\n\nThe US has experienced an effort to move from facility-based services to more of a housing and support approach in regular homes in typical neighborhoods. This movement, involving state-federal and university collaboration, has involved the development of principles of housing and support which could apply across different disability groups interested in moving from the facility-based (bundled program) approach to \"housing and support\". These principles are:\n\nSupportive housing, in addition to \"quality assurance procedures\", are meant to \"ensure quality of care and quality of life\"; Sheehan and Oakes (2004) indicate that residents may be reluctant to complain on satisfaction surveys since they may be relocated to even stricter nursing facilities. However, these projects have included Real Systems Change Grants \"to enhance opportunities for independent living for people with disabilities and to assist 3 communities (in Connecticut) to become models of inclusion of people with disabilities\" and to transition from the nursing facilities (Ibid, 2004). Supported housing (which is the first community living to involve housing, though NGO purchasing and leasing of community homes preceded this development) now is in its 4th decade in the university-governmental and community sectors, and was also succeeded by \"models of housing and health\" from the traditional medical sectors.\n\nPublic housing authorities are \"responsible for the aging housing stock in the US\" and for the \"direct or contractual operation of low and moderate income housing\", among other responsibilities. The US Housing and Urban Development federal department has a range of programs (e.g., mortgage financing programs for home-ownership; Family Self Sufficiency programs). US HUD supports plans for the development or redevelopment of communities (\"planned communities\", US Congress) in 2019 and the development of \"large scale housing and mixed use developments\" (e.g., mixed income housing projects such as through the Madison Mutual Housing Association and Cooperatives; \"housing-business-transportation-recreation-schools\" projects), including on Indian reservations and land in the US.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1895, he isolated and identified adrenaline.\n\nNapoleon Cybulski was born on 14 September 1854 in Krzywonosy, in the Vilna Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Belarus). He came from a Polish-Lithuanian noble family. His father was Józef Napoleon Cybulski, of the Prawdzic coat of arms, and his mother was Marcjanna Cybulska, \"née\" Hutorowicz.\n\nCybulski graduated from secondary school in Minsk and studied medicine at the Imperial Medical and Surgical Academy (since 1881 called Imperial Military Medical Academy) in Saint Petersburg, Russia. In 1880 he received his physician's diploma \"cum eximia laude\" (with the highest distinction). In 1877–85 he worked there as an assistant in the Department of Physiology under Ivan Tarkhanov. In 1885 he obtained the degree of Doctor of Medicine with a thesis on the velocity of blood flow as detected by a photohemotachometer, a device he had constructed himself. He also carried out research on the influence of the phrenic nerve on the respiration rate and on the larynx and the vagus nerves.\n\nThe same year (1885), he moved to Kraków and became head of the Department of Physiology at the Jagiellonian University. In 1887–88 and 1895–96 he served as dean of the Faculty of Medicine and subsequently as rector (1904–5) and deputy rector (1905–9) of the university. He was the founder of the Kraków School of Physiology and from 31 October 1891 was an active member of the Academy of Learning. His students included Adolf Beck, Władysław Szymonowicz, Leon Wachholz, Aleksander Rosner, and Stanisław Maziarski.\n\nHe married Julia Rogozińska and opened a dental surgery office in order to satisfy the financial needs of his large family. In 1916 he bought a manor house in Nawojowa Góra. In 1918 he received the Award of the Erazm and Anna Jerzmanowski Foundation bestowed by the Polish Academy of Learning. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine three times between 1911-1918.\n\nHe died 26 April 1919 of stroke in his study in the Department of Physiology at the Jagiellonian University. He was posthumously awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta.\n\nNapoleon Cybulski is widely regarded as a pioneer of electroencephalography and endocrinology in Poland and the world.\n\nIn 1895, with his pupil (1869–1939), he discovered the hormonal interactions of the adrenal medulla and isolated adrenaline. He called the substance \"nadnerczyna\" (which in Polish literally means \"adrenalin\": \"nadnercze\" is the Polish for \"adrenal gland\").\n\nIn 1890 Cybulski carried out one of the first-ever EEG recordings of the cerebral cortex. Working with Adolf Beck (1863–1942), he conducted pioneering research on electroencephalographic waves. Under Cybulski’s supervision, Beck made pioneering studies of cerebral-cortex activity in response to peripheral-nerve stimulation in dogs and monkeys, using electrodes placed on the skull to record changes in electric potential. In this way they invalidated William Horsley’s notion that these changes reflected the activity of skull muscles. By further analyses of potential changes, they mapped out sensory regions of the cerebral cortex. They also provided evidence that the amplitude of signals depended on the strength and kind of sensory stimulus and on the depth of anesthesia. They suspected that brain function was mediated by neurons' bioelectrical activity. Their studies on brain mapping and nerve stimulation were absolutely innovative, since they were unfamiliar with earlier research done by Richard Caton on changes in bioelectrical activity of the dog brain during sleep, activity, and changes in behavior.\n\nAgain working with Beck, Cybulski showed that every taste sensation in the tongue was caused by a separate kind of receptor. He gave a description of the difference between afferent and efferent impulses entering and leaving the spinal cord based on recordings from dorsal and ventral roots.\n\nIn 1914 Napoleon Cybulski and S. Jeleńska-Macieszyna photographed EEG recordings of experimentally induced seizures.\n\nCybulski was one of the first physiologists to register and describe the blood flow linear velocity of the carotid artery and the femoral artery.\n\nAmong his other discoveries was establishing that an increase in intracranial pressure causes disturbances in blood flow to the brain.\n\nCybulski authored around 100 medical research papers.\n\nHe initiated research on hypnosis in Poland. Some of his theses in \"O hypnotyzmie ze stanowiska fizyjologicznego\" (On Hypnosis From the Physiological Standpoint) anticipate ideas of Sigmund Freud and make him a precursor of the concept of the unconscious.\n\nApart from medicine, Cybulski was also interested in a range of social questions and published books and articles such as \"Czy państwo i społeczeństwo mają obowiązek popierać naukę?\" (Do the State and Society Have an Obligation to Support Science?, 1895), \"W sprawie organizacji gospodarstw włościańskich\" (On the Organization of Peasant Farms, 1896) and \"Nauka wobec wojny\" (Science and War, 1918).\n\nHe was a staunch advocate of allowing women to study medicine. In 1891, Cybulski and a pioneering Polish bacteriologist, Odo Bujwid (1857–1942), established the first girls' \"gimnazjum\" (secondary school) in Kraków.\n\n\n"}

It stars Diane Lane, Michael Woods, and Cotter Smith. The film was marketed with the tagline \"When fantasy leads to terror.\" It was filmed on location in and around Pittsburgh.\n\nKatya Yarno is a window dresser for Horne's department store who specializes in displays with sexy, slightly kinky themes. Surrounded by the equipment of her trade—mannequins and lingerie—Katya lives in a loft apartment in downtown Pittsburgh. She spends her evenings taking her bath by candlelight and thinking up new and more provocative window displays. Katya soon becomes the obsession of Jack Price, a handsome (and married) psychopath. Jack proceeds to stalk Katya and makes her life a living hell. Tired of being harassed, Katya decides to give Jack a taste of his own medicine.\n\n\nArthur began working on \"Lady Beware\" in the late '70s, shortly after the success of her second feature, \"The Mafu Cage\", which screened at Cannes, landed her a four-picture deal at Universal. Universal, however, ended up rejecting the project, which ended up having \"100 homes, 17 drafts, and eight writers,\" as Arthur told \"The Los Angeles Times\" in 1986 ahead of the film's release. \"The purse-holders are men, and they attempted to make \"Lady Beware\" into a violent picture,\" Arthur added. \"I'm not interested in making a picture where a woman gets beat up. I want to show how a lady deals with this kind of insidious violence. A policeman can't help.\"\n\nThe film was shot on location in Pittsburgh during the summer of 1986 after Scotti Brothers Entertainment agreed to finance and distribute it. The budget was reportedly under $2 million. \"Lady Beware\"'s 28 days of shooting took place primarily in the city's North Side and downtown neighborhoods.\n\nArthur did not approve of the film's final cut, which she said was re-edited by the producers to appeal to the exploitation crowd. \"[Some distributors asked for] more sex, so they took outtakes of Diane Lane standing there naked and incorporated them into the film,\" she told \"The Los Angeles Times\" ahead of the film's release. \"To me, that's exploitative. They printed up negatives where I never said print. I, as a female director, would never exploit a woman's body and use it as a turn-on.\" Arthur added that she did not remove her name from the film because she thought it would be unfair to the actors, who can't remove their names from the final product.\n\nLady Beware was released on VHS and Laserdisc in 1988 by International Video Entertainment. A second VHS release was put out in 1991 by Avid Home Entertainment.\n\n"}

It is a yellow, weakly fluorescent solid with melting point over 300 °C. It is soluble in organic solvents such as acetonitrile, but is decomposed by water in the presence of light.\n\nThe name \"heptazine\" is also used for derivative compounds, which have the three hydrogens substituted by other functional groups. Heptazine oligomers and polymers were discovered in the 19th century but their study has long been hampered by their general insolubility. They are used as flame retardants. Heptazine derivatives have been the object of interest recently for potential applications in electronics materials, explosives, and more. The synthesis of heptazine proper was reported only in 1982.\n\nBerzelius discovered in 1815 that the ignition of mercuric thiocyanate yielded, besides cinnabar , carbon disulfide, and nitrogen, a yellow insoluble residue. In the same year, Wöhler described the characeristic twisted yellow column that forms when the salt is ignited and burns (which is the popular \"Pharaoh's serpent\" school chemistry demo). This foam has recently been found to consist of highly and randomly folded sheets of a material with composition close to . The sheets very thin (less than 20 nm) and are conjectured to consist of heptazine or s-triazine cores linked at their corned by nitrogen atoms.\n\nIn 1834 Liebig described the compounds that he named melamine, melam, and melon. In the following years, Leopold Gmelin and W. Henneberg prepared novel salts that were eventually recognized as connected to the compounds described by Liebig, and named melonates and cyamelurates.. \n\nThe structure of these compounds was elucidated only in 1937, by Linus Pauling and J. Holmes Sturdivant. They showed by X-ray crystallography that these compounds contain a core of fused triazine rings, which he named \"cyameluric nucleus\".. \n\nThe synthesis of unsubstituted heptazine was reported only in 1982, by R. S. Hosmane and others from the group of N. Leonard. \n\nThe structure of Liebig's melon eventually identified by T. Komatsu as consisting of linked heptazine units\n\nAccoding Pauling and Sturdivant, the heptazine core is best described as a resonance equlibrium of 20 different structures:\n\nEach of the last three structures above has 5 other versions that differ by rotation and/or mirroring of the whole molecule. If one averages pairs of structures that are equivalent through mirroring, or triplets equivalent through 120 degree rotations, the first 2 and the last 18 reduce to the following schemas:\nHeptazine has a peculiar crystal structure, whose cell spans 16 molecules in asymmetric positions and orientations.\n\nTheoretical calculations indicate that, in heptazine and some of its derivatives, the lowest triplet state (T1) has higher energy (by about ≈ −0.25 eV) than the lowest excited singlet state (S1). Thus heptazine was claimed to be the first example of a stable closed-shell organic molecule violating Hund’s rule.\n\nThe derivative with three amino substituents (2,5,8-triaminoheptazine) is called melem. Melem can be polymerized by condensation with loss of , so that the heptazine cores are linked through amine (NH) bridges. The oligomers and polymers thus obtained are called melon.\n\nMelem and melon are effective flame retardant compounds. The compounds have in common that they melt or decompose at very high temperatures and that they are insoluble in any solvent. This makes characterisation difficult.\n\nThe heptazine derivate with three hydroxyl substituents is called cyameluric acid.\n\nThe heptazine derivative with an azide substituent and two hydroxyl groups is called Linus Pauling's mystery molecule. It is the last molecule he drew on his chalkboard (preserved for posterity) before he died in 1994. Two theories attempt to lift the mystery. It is suggested that Pauling failed to solve the double helix structure of DNA before Watson and Crick because he viewed uracil as an amide and not as the tautomeric hydroxy compound. The other theory suggests that Pauling intended to use the compound as a potential spectroscopic label for binding to DNA. Nelson Leonard observed that Pauling \"must have returned to the source of his original structural inspiration for a new application.\"\n\nThe tri-azido derivatives are investigated for their use as high-energy-density materials (explosives).\n\nIt is believed that one of the graphitic forms of the carbon nitride CN is built up of linked heptazines. Heptazines could be a precursor molecule to the diamond-like beta carbon nitride.\n\n"}

The fighters float inside this space and are capable of movement in all directions. Even though \"Psychic Force\" is structured as a 3D game, the gameplay is in 2D.\n\nThe walls of the force field play a big part in the strategy behind \"Psychic Force\". A character takes damage when they're forced into a wall by their opponent. The characters do not take damage, however, if they move into the wall themselves. If a character takes another hit as they bounce off from the wall, the character will become stunned and fall through the air. The character is eventually invulnerable while they're falling.\n\nAs in most fighting games, the first character to win two rounds wins the match. If time runs out, the players are taken to a sudden death round in which the space is much smaller and both characters have 0% Psycho Gauge. The first person to land an attack in this sudden death round wins the round. When the player is fighting a computer-controlled opponent, however, the character with more health remaining when time runs out wins that round, without going to sudden death.\n\nThe characters are controlled with an eight directional joystick and three buttons which dictate a guard, a light attack, and a heavy attack. By combining these different commands, the player can make combo attacks, throws, and special moves which can break the enemy's defenses.\n\nA character's special move is determined by the Psycho Gauge, which is seen under the Life Gauge of the character. Depending on the type of special move initiated, the Psycho Gauge will immediately drain from within sight and once the character uses up their entire Psycho Gauge, they'll be left with the only option to unleash continuous weak projectiles until the Psycho Gauge is charged back up, either through an automatic slow charge or a manual fast charge in which the player can press all three buttons to help re-charge their Psycho Gauge.\n\nOther tactics in \"Psychic Force\" include a Barrier Guard, which can be used to help protect a character from both physical attacks and special moves but drains the Psycho Gauge real quickly, an Evasion Barrier, in which the character can immediately put up a force field and avoid slamming against the wall even though it uses up 40% of the Psycho Gauge, a Normal Dash which enables a character to move real quickly in any direction from within sight, and a Quick Dash which enables a character to move real fast towards their opponent while being able to deflect any weak projectile that gets in their way.\n\nIn both the original arcade version and home console Story Mode of \"Psychic Force\" (but not later revisions of the arcade version), the player's character goes through eight stages of combat against a specific set of opponents and face off against a specific final boss in the eighth and final stage, which varies and depends on the specific player character's story. The home console Story Mode adds additional cut-scenes in order to advance the story.\n\nThe plot of \"Psychic Force\" takes place in the year 2010, where selected individuals are blessed with the power of psychic abilities. All people imbued with this power are called \"Psychiccers\" and uses a specific element such as fire, light, wind, electricity, gravity, time, or ice in fighting.\n\nPsychiccers are shunned by normal people in general because of their unnatural abilities and that most cases turn violent and deadly from within sight. All of that changes one day when a mysterious Psychiccer organization known as NOA appears and offers Psychiccers a place from within their company. Headed by a young British Psychiccer man named Keith Evans, NOA seeks to create a perfect utopia for Psychiccers and that they'll eliminate anyone who tries to stand in their way.\n\nChallenging NOA's ambition is a small independent group known as Anti-NOA and that one of its members, a young American Psychiccer man named Burn Griffiths, seeks to confront and stop his old friend Keith from going through with his extreme plans of creating a Psychiccer-only world.\n\n\nAcclaim gave \"Psychic Force\" minimal localization, not even replacing the Japanese voice acting or J-pop intro song; instead, they simply added subtitles to the cutscenes.\n\nThe PlayStation version received mediocre reviews. A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" said that while the 3D movement seems innovative at first, it is only a novelty and, in combination with the limited number of close-range attacks, makes the fights dominated by cheap projectile attacks. He remarked, \"On the positive side, \"Psychic Force\" does sport some nice - and if truth be told, very innovative - projectile weapons and background graphics. Unfortunately, these positive factors don't do enough to make up for the game's consistently mediocre gameplay.\" The four reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" similarly commented that the game seemed innovative at first, but was essentially a standard fighter with a heavy reliance on cheap projectile attacks and characters who all use the same move set apart from a few special attacks. They cited the anime video sequences as the game's strong point. Scary Larry of \"GamePro\" praised the music but found the combos lacking, and concluded, \"The game can be mastered easily, which makes it boring in the long run. In all, \"Psychic Force\" is a Force to be reckoned with - at least as a rental.\"\n\n\"M! Games\" gave it a score of 52/100.\n\nIn 1998, a two-episode anime OVA was released, animated by Triangle Staff.\n\nThe first episode describes Keith's escape from the laboratory where he was being experimented on. Burn almost hits him with his motorcycle, and takes a frightened Keith home. Three men in dark suits come looking for Keith, who uses his psychic abilities to injure two of them, and chase the third out. When Burn tries to help Keith escape, they are ambushed and, despite Keith's best efforts, he is dragged away, leaving Burn lying on the ground, which awakens his powers.\n\nThe second episode features Keith and Burn several years later, where Keith has been taken under the wing of Wong, head of NOA. Keith declares his vision of peace to the world, and begins to round up lost Psychiccers. Burn's dormant psychic abilities are detected by Gates, who tries to attack Burn, but Burn is saved by Keith and Sonia. While Burn is in NOA HQ with Keith, he berates him for trying to start a war between humans and Psychiccers, then leaves with Wendy and Emilio. He eventually heads back to confront Keith, but their fight is interrupted by Wong who triggers the self-destruct for the NOA HQ. Keith traps Burn in a cocoon of ice, leaving him as the only survivor.\n\nThis anime OVA's English dub was produced by RLJ Films, and came out in 2002 in the U.S. For some reason, all of the voice actors remain unknown.\n\nThere is a spin-off puzzle game, similar in style to \"Puzzle Bobble\", known as \"Psychic Force: Puzzle Taisen\", developed by C. P. Brain and published by Taito, which was released on October 2, 1997 for Sony PlayStation in Japan only.\n\n"}

Essentially a \"fake\" mobile tower acting between the target mobile phone and the service provider's real towers, it is considered a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The 3G wireless standard offers some risk mitigation due to mutual authentication required from both the handset and the network. However, sophisticated attacks may be able to downgrade 3G and LTE to non-LTE network services which do not require mutual authentication.\n\nIMSI-catchers are used in a number of countries by law enforcement and intelligence agencies, but their use has raised significant civil liberty and privacy concerns and is strictly regulated in some countries such as under the German \"Strafprozessordnung\" (StPO / Code of Criminal Procedure). Some countries do not have encrypted phone data traffic (or very weak encryption), thus rendering an IMSI-catcher unnecessary.\n\nA virtual base transceiver station (VBTS) is a device for identifying the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) of a nearby GSM mobile phone and intercepting its calls. It was patented and first commercialized by Rohde & Schwarz in 2003. The device can be viewed as simply a modified cell tower with a malicious operator, and on 4 January 2012, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that the patent is invalid for obviousness.\n\nThe GSM specification requires the handset to authenticate to the network, but does \"not\" require the network to authenticate to the handset. This well-known security hole is exploited by an IMSI catcher. The IMSI catcher masquerades as a base station and logs the IMSI numbers of all the mobile stations in the area, as they attempt to attach to the IMSI-catcher. It allows forcing the mobile phone connected to it to use no call encryption (A5/0 mode) or to use easily breakable encryption (A5/1 or A5/2 mode), making the call data easy to intercept and convert to audio. \n\nThe 3G wireless standard mitigates risk and enhanced security of the protocol due to mutual authentication required from both the handset and the network and removes the false base station attack in GSM. Some sophisticated attacks against 3G and LTE may be able to downgrade to non-LTE network services which then does not require mutual authentication.\n\nBody-worn IMSI-catchers that target nearby mobile phones are being advertised to law enforcement agencies in the US.\n\nIMSI-catchers are often deployed by court order without a search warrant, the lower judicial standard of a pen register and trap-and-trace order being preferred by law enforcement. They can also be used in search and rescue operation for missing persons. Police departments have been reluctant to reveal use of these programs and contracts with vendors such as Harris Corporation, the maker of Stingray and Kingfish phone tracker devices. \n\nIn the UK, the first public body to admit using IMSI catchers was the Scottish Prison Service, though it is likely that the Metropolitan Police Service has been using IMSI catchers since 2011 or before.\n\nEvery mobile phone has the requirement to optimize the reception. If there is more than one base station of the subscribed network operator accessible, it will always choose the one with the strongest signal. An IMSI-catcher masquerades as a base station and causes every mobile phone of the simulated network operator within a defined radius to log in. With the help of a special identity request, it is able to force the transmission of the IMSI.\n\nThe IMSI-catcher subjects the phones in its vicinity to a man-in-the-middle attack, appearing to them as a preferred base station in terms of signal strength. With the help of a SIM, it simultaneously logs into the GSM network as a mobile station. Since the encryption mode is chosen by the base station, the IMSI-catcher can induce the mobile station to use no encryption at all. Hence it can encrypt the plain text traffic from the mobile station and pass it to the base station.\n\nThere is only an indirect connection from mobile station via IMSI-catcher to the GSM network. For this reason, incoming phone calls cannot generally be patched through to the mobile station by the GSM network, although more modern versions of these devices have their own mobile patch-through solutions in order to provide this functionality.\n\nFalse base station attacks are prevented by a combination of key freshness and integrity protection of signaling data, not by authenticating the serving network.\n\nTo provide a high network coverage, the UMTS standard allows for inter-operation with GSM. Therefore, not only UMTS but also GSM base stations are connected to the UMTS service network. This fallback is a security disadvantage and allows a new possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\nThe assignment of an IMSI catcher has a number of difficulties:\n\n\nSome preliminary research has been done in trying to detect and frustrate IMSI-catchers. One such project is through the Osmocom open source mobile station software. This is a special type of mobile phone firmware that can be used to detect and fingerprint certain network characteristics of IMSI-catchers, and warn the user that there is such a device operating in their area. But this firmware/software-based detection is strongly limited to a select few, outdated GSM mobile phones (i.e. Motorola) that are no longer available on the open market. The main problem is the closed-source nature of the major mobile phone producers.\n\nThe application Android IMSI-Catcher Detector (AIMSICD) is being developed to detect and circumvent IMSI-catchers by StingRay and silent SMS. Technology for a stationary network of IMSI-catcher detectors has also been developed. Several apps listed on the Google Play Store as IMSI catcher detector apps include SnoopSnitch, Cell Spy Catcher, and GSM Spy Finder and have between 100,000 and 500,000 app downloads each. However, these apps have limitations in that they do not have access to phone's underlying hardware and may offer only minimal protection.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2089053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089053", "title": "Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster", "text": "Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster\n\nThe Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster is a Christian denomination founded by Ian Paisley in 1951. Doctrinally, the church describes itself as fundamentalist, evangelical, and separatist. Most of its members live in Northern Ireland, where the church is headquartered. The church has additional congregations in the Republic of Ireland, Great Britain and Australia, and a sister denomination in North America that has congregations in Canada and the United States. It also has a sister denomination in Nepal which was formed from the Nepal mission to the Unreached in November 2013.\n\nThe current Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church is Rev Gordon Dane, minister of the founding church in Crossgar. John Armstrong is the current Deputy Moderator.\n\nThe Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster began on 17 March 1951 (St Patrick's Day) as the result of a conflict between some members of the local Lissara Presbyterian congregation in Crossgar, County Down, Northern Ireland, and the Down Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland. At a meeting on 8 January 1951, the Down Presbytery banned the elders of the local congregation from using the church hall for a Gospel mission. When two elders refused to accept the Presbytery decision, they were immediately suspended. As a result of this disagreement with the Presbytery, five of the seven session members, all the Sunday School teachers, and 60 members of the congregation withdrew from the Down Presbytery and the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.\n\nCollege lecturers of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland have suggested that the above story, though often quoted, is incomplete. While the Gospel Mission was a reason for the breakaway church forming, the Presbytery objection was not to the Mission or to the Gospel, but to the invited preacher, Ian Paisley. The Lissara Mission went ahead with a different preacher and Lissara Presbyterian Church continued to exist (albeit with fewer members), and a number of dissenting members later returned. However Free Presbyterians from Crossgar dispute that there ever was such a mission. \nThe departing elders felt the Presbyterian Church in Ireland denomination was inconsistent in allowing dances and parties to be held in the church halls while at the same time refusing a Gospel mission under the leadership of Ian Paisley. The \"Free Presbyterian Manifesto\", which was published during the time leading up to the founding of the new church, also mentioned other reasons for the secession, such as the failure of the 1927 heresy trial in the Presbyterian Church in Ireland (PCI) to unseat Professor Davey for his controversial views, membership in the World Council of Churches (which the PCI later left), and poll irregularities in the election of elders. In that year, under the leadership of Paisley, four new congregations joined together to form the Presbytery of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster.\n\nSydney Lince served as Moderator of the new church for a few months, but perceiving that Paisley was keen to take on the role, he stood down and asked Paisley to replace him. One of the inaugural elders of the new church, George Gibson, was expelled for his views on the doctrines of holiness as he was an Arminian, and subsequently rejoined Lissara Presbyterian Church in 1958. He had been the first secretary of the new church, had served as the architect of the first church building in the new denomination, and his office had been used as the registered office of the denomination.\n\nThe appointment of Paisley as First Minister of Northern Ireland in May 2007 led to a great deal of controversy within the Free Presbyterian Church. Many members of the church claimed that such an appointment put Paisley, as Moderator, at odds with many of the core beliefs of his church. The church had declared some years previously that it would be unbiblical to have terrorists or ex-terrorists in the government of Northern Ireland. The church is also strongly opposed to homosexuality, yet the First Minister's office is responsible for protecting LGBT rights in Northern Ireland. One of Paisley's strongest critics was his erstwhile ally and former prison cellmate Ivan Foster. A stormy meeting of the Presbytery of the church in September 2007 resolved the crisis by agreeing that Paisley would step down as Moderator in January 2008. The Presbytery met in Dungannon on 18 January 2008 to elect a new Moderator and selected Ron Johnstone, who had been Deputy Moderator. Paisley was therefore replaced as Moderator after more than 50 years in the post.\n\nFollowing a number of high-profile comments made by Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Member of Parliament (MP) Iris Robinson, the Advertising Standards Authority upheld a finding that an advertisement placed by the Kirk Session of the Sandown Free Presbyterian Church breached advertising codes. The church had taken out the 540-word advertisement in the News Letter on 1 August 2008 (one day before the annual Belfast Gay Pride event) describing \"homosexuality as an abomination, defined homosexuals as perverts and called on religious followers to maintain a very public stance against the gay community.\" The decision was later overturned and the church cleared of all wrongdoing.\n\nThe church adheres to Calvinist doctrines. It also self-describes as fundamentalist which it sees as an appropriate term to describe its stance of being anti-liberal. Christian fundamentalism has evolved over the years to where the original five essential doctrines that one had to hold to be considered fundamentalist—namely: the inerrancy of the Bible, the literal nature of the Biblical accounts, the Virgin Birth of Christ, the bodily resurrection and physical return of Christ, the substitutionary atonement of Christ on the cross—were mixed in with a healthy dose of \"biblical separatism\", a doctrine that advocates avoiding any public or private worship with people of other denominations that it considers apostates or heretics. At the start of Paisley's ministry this separatism was focused heavily on the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, a denomination from which it drew many of its initial members. For the FPC the main target of its doctrinal ire, however, has always been and still continues to be the Roman Catholic Church. From 2011 until 2015 its main website greeted visitors with a statement on the FPC's disapproval of the Roman Catholic mass, disputing \"the false notion... that there is little difference\" between the mass and Protestant communion.\n\nBaptism and the Lord's Supper are recognised as sacraments of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster. Members are allowed to determine the proper mode (immersion, pouring, sprinkling) and subjects (adult believers or believers' children) that they prefer, but the church does not sanction baptismal regeneration. The Lord's Supper is observed monthly, unless a local congregation prefers a more frequent observance. Alongside the Free Presbyterian Articles of Faith, the Westminster Standards are considered doctrinal standards subordinate to the Bible. On account of their additional adherence to the Articles of Faith, and because of their baptismal views, some regard the church as only nominally Presbyterian, nearer to the Baptist Church, and more nearly allied to modern Fundamentalist Christianity than to the Presbyterian and Reformed tradition.\n\nFor many outside the church, political and religious opposition to the Roman Catholic Church, considered by the Free Presbyterians to be a Protestant Reformation principle, represents the single most distinctive characteristic of this denomination, not least because this was a distinctive characteristic of Ian Paisley's own theological outlook.\n\nThe FPC (on 18 May 2005) published a \"Book of Church Order\" in which its governmental policies and procedures are set forth publicly.\n\nThe polity of the FPC includes allowing a cleric such as Paisley to hold an apparently indefinite term of office as Moderator. However, following a dispute over Paisley's political activities, he agreed to step down as Moderator in January 2008. He was succeeded by Ron Johnstone. The North American branch of the denomination has elected its own moderator since 2005.\n\nFrom four churches in 1951, the denomination grew and peaked at 75 by 1997. Today it has about 60 congregations in Northern Ireland and a total of about 100 throughout the world, including England, Scotland, the Republic of Ireland (chiefly in County Donegal and County Monaghan), Canada, the United States, Nepal and Australia. According to the 2011 Northern Ireland census, the church has 10,068 members in Northern Ireland. As of 2004, missionaries were serving in India, Jamaica, Kenya, the Republic of Ireland, Spain, the Philippines and Germany. Since then new mission fields have opened in Liberia, Nepal and Uganda.\n\nIn Kenya the church's 4 missionaries work with the Bible Christian Faith Church. In Liberia the forming Free Presbyterian Church in Liberia has 4 congregations.\n\nThe church currently operates two Bible colleges for the training of ministers and missionaries. These are the Whitefield College of the Bible, formerly based in Banbridge, County Down, but now relocated to Belfast, and the Geneva Reformed Seminary in Greenville, South Carolina, USA.\n\nThe church in North America has been independent of the Ulster Presbytery since 2005, and has its own Moderator. Frank McClelland was the first Moderator, and he was succeeded in 2006 by David Mook (a minister in Phoenix, Arizona). The two Presbyteries are in full communion with each other. A Free Presbyterian International Congress was held 19–23 June 2006 in Martyrs Memorial Free Presbyterian Church in Belfast. This event saw Free Presbyterians from all over the world gather in Northern Ireland for a week of meetings. The Nepal Free Presbyterian Church also elects its own Moderator, currently the Rev Paul Thapa. This Presbytery is also in full communion with the other two.\n\nFree Presbyterian Churches are usually of simple design, cohering with Protestant ideals, dating back to the Reformation. This contrasts with traditional Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches, which tend to be well-ornamented in design. The church states that this shows humility and allows the member to focus on worship.\n\nChurches usually include the following:\n\nThe motto of the Free Presbyterian Church is the same as the Presbyterian Church in Ireland: \"Ardens sed virens\" (\"burning but flourishing\"). It is incorporated in a scroll form on the logo, shown here.\n\nIn all Free Presbyterian Churches, the pulpit fall bears the motto and logo of the Church, albeit in slightly different designs.\n\n\nGlynn Moore and Sharon Dick, \"The History of Crossgar Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, A New Beginning ..\"(Crossgar, Co.

It was released on 3 March 2003 by The Echo Label.\n\nAfter working with live musicians on their previous album, \"Things to Make and Do\" (2000), Moloko returned to electronic territory with this album, although the previous album's organic influences remain, as seen on \"Familiar Feeling\" and \"Over & Over\".\n\nAt the time of its release, the long-term romantic partnership between group members Róisín Murphy and Mark Brydon had dissolved, setting the stage for Murphy's 2005 solo album, \"Ruby Blue\". \"Statues\" is composed of material which describes the various emotional milestones in a romantic relationship, or rather as it comes apart. Moloko toured Europe extensively to promote the album and disbanded shortly thereafter.\n\n\"Come On\" and \"Statues\"\n\"Come On\" suggests the diminishing sex life of a tense pairing (\"Do you remember the way we danced? I wish I could forget it\"). The song \"Statues\" implies isolation in the absence of a distant or departed lover (\"If all the statues in the world would turn to flesh [...] would they be kind enough to comfort me?\"). With its evident theme of dissolving romance, \"Statues\" launched a debate among fans as to whether the songs were about the end of Brydon and Murphy's romantic relationship. Murphy later commented on this on her official forum: \"[A]s regards my long and relationship with Mark, your[sic] right its[sic] all there to read in the records we made so i[sic] don't need to tell you!\"\n\n\"Familiar Feeling\"\nThe opening track, \"Familiar Feeling\", is an upbeat remembrance stated as one lover trying to convince the other that the relationship was always meant to be, and it should not be in jeopardy because of jealousy and mistrust. The song is elaborately arranged with hints of both Latin and Irish folk music. Brydon's lyrical bass guitar playing can be heard trailing Murphy's lead vocal in the song's bridge.\n\n\"Over & Over\"\nThe closing track, \"Over & Over\", assures the audience that the pairing (in the story) has indeed dissolved, and is among the most seriously stated of Moloko's love songs. It has a lyrical yet simple, winding acoustic guitar line (which echoes in the bass line) and plaintive lyrics such as \"Can't imagine where you are, you are all I've ever seen\". Moloko have said that they were aiming high on \"Over & Over\", claiming it took two weeks of work to score just the strings for it. Brydon later said, \"There was no compromise with 'Over & Over'...We all felt it should be allowed to be what it is.\"\n\nNon-album tracks\nAnother track appearing to be from this period, initially titled \"Emotional Bankruptcy\", was retitled \"Bankrupt Emotionally\" for its appearance on the 2006 greatest hits collection \"Catalogue\".\n\nIn contrast to the tragic view of love on \"Statues\", the song \"Take My Hand\", a relatively upbeat love song, was an outtake. The song had a prominent brass scoring, jazz-funk bass line and wistful piano, as well as a confident multi-tracked delivery by Murphy that displays her extraordinary vocal technique. \"Take My Hand\" is available as a B-side to \"Forever More\", and was donated to War Child to help the charity raise money for children affected by war.\n"}
{"id": "2089060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089060", "title": "Belmont, New South Wales", "text": "Belmont, New South Wales\n\nBelmont is a suburb in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia, located 20 kilometres (12 mi) from Newcastle's central business district on the eastern side of Lake Macquarie and is part of the City of Lake Macquarie.\n\nBelmont is situated on a sandy peninsula formed by the Tasman Sea on the east and Lake Macquarie.\n\nThe area around Belmont was inhabited by the Awabakal tribe of Aborigines. In 1825 Reverend Lancelot Edward Threlkeld established a mission at Belmont. He established small scale farming of wheat and \"Indian Corn\" and employed the local Aboriginal people to help him. While doing so, Threlkeld recorded phoenetically the language of the Awabakal and produced the first serious works on Aboriginal language, its grammar, usage, and relation to other Aboriginal tribal languages.\n\nThomas Williamson (1833–80) was born in the northernmost island of Unst, Shetland Islands in a town called Belmont. He was the third settler in the Lake Macquarie area and in 1865 selected 100 acres, including Bahtahbah (site of Rev. Threlkeld's old Aboriginal mission) to settle. On the rising land leading to the top of the hill, near the corner of Walter and Victoria Streets (and what became, many years later the Infants School) he built a large residence to serve as a guest house, naming it after the town of his birth \"Belmont\" House. It is thought the village which grew up around it may have assumed the name from the house. As the village grew, some of the streets were named after his children: Ada St leads down to the yacht club, Maude St comes from Cahill Oval down to the water at the baths. Walter St would have come right past the old Belmont house whilst Alick (named for Alexander) and Ernest Sts marked the eastern boundary of the original acreage. Thomas St, outside the shopping centre, is named after Thomas Williamson himself. On the eastern side of the old house Williamson planted a vineyard, facing towards the lagoon, and to the north an orchard including banana trees.\n\nIn 1874 he erected the first church just near where George St meets the highway, and the Belmont Post Office was opened in 1877 with Thomas Williamson himself as Postmaster. He continued in this capacity until his death. He was also the first licensee of the Belmont Hotel, which opened nearby the church. In 1873, realising that there were enough children in the local village to warrant the existence of one, he opened the first school, a single-roomed building, next to Maudeville Cottage. John Anderson bought \"Anderson's Hill\" in 1870 and built a guesthouse called \"Bellevue\" after which the road was named.\n\nThe area from Ross St on the water, to Lewers St was bought by Robert D. Lewers, Sydney Manager of the Bank of London\nand subdivided in 1916, known as Lewers Estate for many years.\n\nThe land around the lake was of such poor quality, apart from in small patches, that as early as 1828, Henry Dangar, Government Surveyor, knew that it was more suited \" to the retired naval, military or civil officer, or to the merchant, inclined to quit the busy scene, one who is fond of shooting, fishing, or hunting, or boat sailing, where he can enjoy living with a most salubrious air...\" Any industrial use or mining in the lake was constrained by the terrible nature of the bar on the lake's entrance at Swansea. Hence, in order to provide to a larger need for lifestyle and recreation, rather than industrial use, the issue of transport was vital. The road had been a major problem from almost the beginning of the township's life. It was reported as \"one of the worst in the colony\" – only 12 miles from Newcastle but taking two and a half to three hours by dray. Guesthouses failed to thrive because of the severity of the road conditions and really it was not until the road was formally fixed in the 1910s, and the Pacific Highway came through in the 1920s, that Belmont was able to make the most of its beautiful surroundings, and the township started to thrive. In addition, the New Redhead Estate & Coal Company extended their trainline to Belmont, where both a station and coal-loading ramps and sidings were constructed. Passenger trains ran every day of the week to Belmont. The line was closed in 1991.\n\nThrough urbanisation and the use of the hills to the north and north-east of the peninsula, Belmont has become one of the major centres of Lake Macquarie. The suburb itself is currently (2011 census) the fourth-largest by population, with the surrounding locality (consisting of Belmont North, Floraville and Jewells) the largest locality within the jurisdiction of Lake Macquarie City Council.\n\nAccording to the 2016 census of Population, there were 7,114 people in Belmont.\n\nBelmont is home to many shops, restaurants and many other amenities. Belmont and the surrounding locality also include 4 primary schools (Belmont Public School, Belmont North Public School, Floraville Public School and Jewells Public School); 2 secondary schools, Belmont High School and Belmont Christian College, along with a tertiary institution in the form of a campus of TAFE NSW (formerly Hunter Institute of TAFE). Belmont Hospital, located on Croudace Bay Road, is the only public hospital in Lake Macquarie. Belmont Baths, a public swimming enclosure measuring 70m in length and 45m in width, re-opened to the public on the 22nd December 2018. \n\nUntil May 2006, Aeropelican (now FlyPelican) operated scheduled passenger services from Belmont Airport to Sydney Airport. The discontinuation of these services has all but closed the airfield, with owners seeking to develop the land. Belmont Airport is now privately co-owned by Red Bull Air Race pilot Matt Hall and a skydiving company.\n\nMany collieries, large and small, sought coal from the coal seams which were plentiful in the Belmont area, the largest of these being the BHP's John Darling Colliery at Belmont North. The New Redhead Estate & Coal Mining Company operated a railway until recent times from Belmont to Adamstown, a suburb of Newcastle, where it joined the New South Wales Government Railways Main Line. The railway carried passenger trains as well as coal trains and served several collieries. Also, situated on a spur line just south of Belmont railway station, was a large railway coal loading facility, whereby motor trucks from collieries as far afield as Swansea, New South Wales, could load their coal into railway trucks for transporting to Newcastle's port. The smaller collieries closed due to the 1960s - 1970s slump in the industry, the last being Belltop Colliery. The larger collieries closed later. \n\n\n"}

He was educated at Truro Grammar School, then at Harrow and Exeter College, Oxford, Vivian entered the army in 1793, and less than a year later became a captain in the 28th Foot. Under Lord Moira he served in the campaign of 1794 in Flanders and the Netherlands. At the end of the expedition, the 28th bore a distinguished part in Lord Cathcart's action of Geldermalsen. In 1798 Vivian was transferred to the 7th Light Dragoons (later Hussars), and in Sir Ralph Abercromby's division was present in the Helder campaign in Holland at the battles of Bergen and Alkmaar (19 September to 6 October 1799).\n\nIn 1800, he received his majority, and in 1804 he became lieutenant colonel of the 7th. In command of this regiment he sailed to join Lieutenant-General Sir David Baird at Corunna in 1808, and took part in Lord Henry Paget's cavalry fights at Sahagún and Benavente. During the retreat of Lieut-General Sir John Moore's army the 7th were constantly employed with the rearguard. Vivian was present at the Battle of Corunna, and returned with the remainder of the army to England. It was not until September 1813 that the 7th returned to the Peninsula. On 24 November, Vivian (now colonel and aide-de-camp to the Prince Regent) was appointed to command a light cavalry brigade (13th and 14th Light Dragoons) under Rowland Hill, 1st Viscount Hill in Wellington's army. With this corps he served at the Battle of the Nive (9–13 December).\n\nIn January 1814, Vivian transferred to lead a light cavalry brigade in William Carr Beresford's corps. The 1,000-strong unit included the 18th Hussars and the 1st King's German Legion Hussars. Vivian took a marked part in the action of Gave de Pau and the Battle of Orthez. On 8 April, Vivian fought a brilliant action at Croix d'Orade on the Ers River, where he was very severely wounded. In this clash, the 18th Hussars seized a key bridge intact, helping Wellington to isolate the French defenders of Toulouse. At the beginning of 1815 he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB); he had been a major general for several months.\n\nIn April 1815, Sir Hussey Vivian was appointed to command the 6th Brigade of the Earl of Uxbridge's Cavalry Division. Vivian's brigade included the 10th and 18th Hussars as well as the 1st and 2nd Hussars King's German Legion. At the Battle of Waterloo the 6th Brigade was posted on the Duke of Wellington's left flank. In the late afternoon, Vivian's regiments, with those of General Vandeleur's 4th Brigade, were ordered to move to support the centre of the line, which was under pressure from Napoleon's Imperial Guard. After the enemy were repulsed, Vivian's hussars made the final charge of the day between Hougomont and La Haye Sainte, sweeping the Middle Guard and Line units before them before breaking upon the squares of the Old Guard, which they soon learned to avoid. This service was rewarded by the thanks of both houses of Parliament, an award of the KCH, and the Orders of Maria Theresa and St. Vladimir from the emperors of Austria and Russia.\n\nAfter hostilities had ceased, Vivian remained in France as part of the Army of Occupation in command of the 2nd Brigade of Cavalry. In 1816 he was censured by army commander Lieutenant General Lord Combermere, under orders from the Duke of Wellington, for failing to report a disturbance in a French theatre caused by officers of the 18th Hussars.\n\nVivian sat in the House of Commons as member for Truro and then Windsor from 1821 to 1831, after which he was made commander of the forces in Ireland and given the GCH. He was also appointed to the Privy Council of Ireland in 1831.\n\nFrom 1825 to 1830 he was Inspector-General of the Cavalry and in 1830 was appointed a Groom of the Bedchamber, serving King William IV throughout his reign until 1837, after which he was promoted Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB). In 1835 he became Master-General of the Ordnance (until 1841) and was sworn of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom the same year. In 1837 he was elected MP for East Cornwall, sitting until 1841.\n\nHe was created a baronet of Truro in the County of Cornwall in 1827. In 1841, he was elected to the Royal Society as a Fellow in February and was raised to the peerage as Baron Vivian, of Glynn and of Truro in the County of Cornwall in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in August.\n\nA year later he died at Baden-Baden and was succeeded by his eldest son, to whom he also bequeathed his recently acquired estate at Glynn, near Bodmin.\n\nHis first marriage in 1804 was to Eliza Champion, daughter of Philip Champion de Crespigny, with whom he had the following children:\n\nHe married secondly Letitia Webster, daughter of Rev. James Agnew Webster, and had at least one child:\n\nA natural son, Sir Robert John Hussey Vivian (1802–1887), was brought up as one of the family.

He is Jewish and speaks fluent Hebrew.\n\nHe worked his way up to first-team selection from Ajax's youth department, making his full debut in an away game against Roda JC on 21 January 2004, and scored his first goal against Willem II on 16 May.\n\nDe Ridder was a regular throughout the second half of the campaign, starting nine games and appearing a further six times as a substitute. De Ridder made his UEFA Champions League debut in September 2004, coming on as a 69th-minute substitute in a 4–0 defeat at Bayern Munich. In December 2004, he was offered an improved contract until June 2007.\n\nPart of the Netherlands side that reached the second qualifying round of the UEFA European Under-19 Championship in 2002–03, De Ridder stepped up to the U21s as the 2006 UEFA European Championship qualifying campaign kicked off.\n\nDe Ridder was told prior to the 2005–2006 season that there would be no room for him in the squad and he could expect little playing time if he decided to stay.\n\nDe Ridder joined Celta de Vigo permanently on 31 August 2005.\n\nOn 25 September 2005, De Ridder made his official debut for Celta when they beat Sevilla, allowing the Galician club to temporarily top La Liga. On 3 April 2006, De Ridder scored his first official goal for Celta against Atlético Madrid. Throughout the second half of the campaign he was a regular for Celta, but they were relegated to Segunda Division at the end of the 2006–07 season.\n\nDe Ridder signed for Birmingham City on a free transfer on 3 July 2007. He made his Premier League debut on 12 August 2007 as a substitute in the opening match of the season against Chelsea, but injured his ankle within minutes of coming on and was unable to complete the match. Though starting the League Cup defeat at Blackburn Rovers, he was not considered fit enough for League games until after the October international break, when he made a substitute appearance against Manchester City. He was a key player in Birmingham's 3–2 win against Wigan Athletic on 27 October 2007 in which he made his full home debut.\nDe Ridder's last game for the club was in January 2008 in the FA Cup, manager Alex McLeish considering him better suited to a style of play which placed more emphasis on passing than did Birmingham's.\nHis contract was cancelled by mutual consent at the end of the season.\n\nHe joined Wigan Athletic the next day on a free transfer and signed a three-year deal. De Ridder got his first assist against Newcastle coming off the bench and swinging in an 89th minute corner for a dramatic Titus Bramble equalizer. He was released by Wigan at the end of the 2010–11 season.\n\nDe Ridder moved to Israel and signed for Hapoel Tel Aviv on loan until the end of the season on 20 January 2010 after failing to make an appearance for Wigan Athletic in the 2009–10 season. Hapoel Tel Aviv were surprised to learn that De Ridder did not have an Israeli passport since the age of 3 and would have to register him as a foreigner. The club then approached the Interior Ministry to check what allowances could be made to register De Ridder as an Israeli since he is Jewish. During his time with Hapoel, De Ridder scored a crucial goal against Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv F.C. in the 46th minute (which won the game for Hapoel). He also scored the third goal against F.C. Ashdod, a game which Hapoel won 4–0. He won the Israeli Cup and the Israeli Championship with Hapoel Tel Aviv in 2010.\n\nOn 9 July 2011, De Ridder signed a two-year contract with Grasshopper Club Zürich. Through his first 11 games for the club, De Ridder assisted two Swiss Super League goals.\n\nEver-present in the qualification games of the Netherlands U-21 team along with Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, De Ridder entered the finals as the most experienced member of the Netherlands' U-21 squad with 18 caps. He scored the decisive goal in the match against Italy which ensured qualification for the semifinals. The Netherlands went on to win the UEFA U-21 Championship 2006.\n\nIn 2007 De Ridder was called up by Jong Oranje coach Foppe de Haan to be part of his squad for the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship held in the Netherlands. De Ridder participated in their first round group match against Israel (1–0 win) and after the match against Portugal (2–1 win) they secured a semifinal spot and qualification for the 2008 Summer Olympics. In the semifinals against England (1–1, 13–12 after 32 penalty kicks) De Ridder scored and missed one of the penalty kicks. In the final against Serbia (4–1), De Ridder provided the pass from which Otman Bakkal made it 1–0. In the second half De Ridder created the opportunity for Ryan Babel to put the Netherlands 2–0 up, and in the 87th minute Luigi Bruins scored a tap-in from a De Ridder move to make it 4–1. The Netherlands won the UEFA U-21 Championship 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The episode was written by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, and directed by Parker.\n\nIn the episode, the deadly \"Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka\" is sighted in South Park and the town's fearless hunters, Ned and Jimbo, are on the case.

These coordinates have the advantage that they cover the entire spacetime manifold of the maximally extended Schwarzschild solution and are well-behaved everywhere outside the physical singularity.\n\nKruskal–Szekeres coordinates on a black hole geometry are defined, from the Schwarzschild coordinates formula_1, by replacing \"t\" and \"r\" by a new timelike coordinate \"T\" and a new spacelike coordinate formula_2:\nfor the exterior region formula_5 outside the event horizon and:\nfor the interior region formula_8. Here formula_9 is the gravitational constant multiplied by the Schwarzschild mass parameter, and this article is using units where formula_10 = 1.\n\nIt follows that on the union of the exterior region, the event horizon and the interior region the Schwarzschild radial coordinate formula_11 (not to be confused with the Schwarzschild radius formula_12), is determined in terms of Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates as the (unique) solution of the equation:\nUsing the Lambert W function the solution is written as:\nMoreover one sees immediately that in the region external to the black hole formula_15\nwhereas in the region internal to the black hole formula_17\nIn these new coordinates the metric of the Schwarzschild black hole manifold is given by\nwritten using the (− + + +) metric signature convention and where the angular component of the metric (the Riemannian metric of the 2-sphere) is:\n\nExpressing the metric in this form shows clearly that radial null geodesics i.e. with constant formula_21 are parallel to one of the lines formula_22. In the Schwarzschild coordinates, the Schwarzschild radius formula_12 is the radial coordinate of the event horizon formula_24. In the Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates the event horizon is given by formula_25. Note that the metric is perfectly well defined and non-singular at the event horizon. The curvature singularity is located at formula_26.\n\nThe transformation between Schwarzschild coordinates and Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates is defined for \"r\" > 2\"GM\", and −∞ < \"t\" < ∞, which is the range for which the Schwarzschild coordinates make sense. However in this region, \"r\" is an analytic function of \"T\" and \"X\" and can be extended, as an analytic function at least to the first singularity which occurs at formula_26. Thus the above metric is a solution of Einstein's equations throughout this region. The allowed values are\nNote that this extension assumes that the solution is analytic everywhere.\n\nIn the maximally extended solution there are actually two singularities at \"r\" = 0, one for positive \"T\" and one for negative \"T\". The negative \"T\" singularity is the time-reversed black hole, sometimes dubbed a \"white hole\". Particles can escape from a white hole but they can never return.\n\nThe maximally extended Schwarzschild geometry can be divided into 4 regions each of which can be covered by a suitable set of Schwarzschild coordinates. The\nKruskal–Szekeres coordinates, on the other hand, cover the entire spacetime manifold. The four regions are separated by event horizons.\n\nThe transformation given above between Schwarzschild and Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates applies only in regions I and II. A similar transformation can be written down in the other two regions.\n\nThe Schwarzschild time coordinate \"t\" is given by\nIn each region it runs from −∞ to +∞ with the infinities at the event horizons.\n\nBased on the requirements that the quantum process of Hawking radiation is unitary, 't Hooft proposed that the regions I and III, and II and IV are just mathematical artefacts coming from choosing branches for roots rather than parallel universes and that the equivalence relation \nshould be imposed. If we think of regions III and IV as having spherical coordinates but with a negative choice for the square root to compute formula_11, then we just correspondingly use opposite points on the sphere to denote the same point in space, so e.g. \nand formula_34.\nSince this is a free action by the group formula_35 preserving the metric, this gives a well defined Lorentzian manifold. It identifies the limit formula_36 of the interior region II corresponding to the coordinate line segment formula_37 with the limit formula_38 of the exterior region I corresponding to formula_39. The identification does mean that whereas each pair formula_40 correspond to a spatial direction on a sphere, the point formula_41 corresponds to a line i.e. a point on the projective plane formula_42 instead, and the topology of the underlying manifold is no longer formula_43.\n\nKruskal–Szekeres coordinates have a number of useful features which make them helpful for building intuitions about the Schwarzschild spacetime. Chief among these is the fact that all radial light-like geodesics (the world lines of light rays moving in a radial direction) look like straight lines at a 45-degree angle when drawn in a Kruskal–Szekeres diagram (this can be derived from the metric equation given above, which guarantees that if formula_44 then the proper time formula_45). All timelike world lines of slower-than-light objects will at every point have a slope closer to the vertical time axis (the \"T\" coordinate) than 45 degrees. So, a light cone drawn in a Kruskal–Szekeres diagram will look just the same as a light cone in a Minkowski diagram in special relativity.\n\nThe event horizons bounding the black hole and white hole interior regions are also a pair of straight lines at 45 degrees, reflecting the fact that a light ray emitted at the horizon in a radial direction (aimed outward in the case of the black hole, inward in the case of the white hole) would remain on the horizon forever. Thus the two black hole horizons coincide with the boundaries of the future light cone of an event at the center of the diagram (at \"T\"=\"X\"=0), while the two white hole horizons coincide with the boundaries of the past light cone of this same event. Any event inside the black hole interior region will have a future light cone that remains in this region (such that any world line within the event's future light cone will eventually hit the black hole singularity, which appears as a hyperbola bounded by the two black hole horizons), and any event inside the white hole interior region will have a past light cone that remains in this region (such that any world line within this past light cone must have originated in the white hole singularity, a hyperbola bounded by the two white hole horizons). Note that although the horizon looks as though it is an outward expanding cone, the area of this surface, given by \"r\" is just formula_46, a constant. I.e., these coordinates can be deceptive if care is not exercised.\n\nIt may be instructive to consider what curves of constant \"Schwarzschild\" coordinate would look like when plotted on a Kruskal-Szekeres diagram. It turns out that curves of constant \"r\"-coordinate in Schwarzschild coordinates always look like hyperbolas bounded by a pair of event horizons at 45 degrees, while lines of constant \"t\"-coordinate in Schwarzschild coordinates always look like straight lines at various angles passing through the center of the diagram. The black hole event horizon bordering exterior region I would coincide with a Schwarzschild \"t\"-coordinate of +∞ while the white hole event horizon bordering this region would coincide with a Schwarzschild \"t\"-coordinate of −∞, reflecting the fact that in Schwarzschild coordinates an infalling particle takes an infinite coordinate time to reach the horizon (i.e. the particle's distance from the horizon approaches zero as the Schwarzschild \"t\"-coordinate approaches infinity), and a particle traveling up away from the horizon must have crossed it an infinite coordinate time in the past. This is just an artifact of how Schwarzschild coordinates are defined; a free-falling particle will only take a finite proper time (time as measured by its own clock) to pass between an outside observer and an event horizon, and if the particle's world line is drawn in the Kruskal-Szekeres diagram this will also only take a finite coordinate time in Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates.\n\nThe Schwarzschild coordinate system can only cover a single exterior region and a single interior region, such as regions I and II in the Kruskal-Szekeres diagram. The Kruskal-Szekeres coordinate system, on the other hand, can cover a \"maximally extended\" spacetime which includes the region covered by Schwarzschild coordinates. Here, \"maximally extended\" refers to the idea that the spacetime should not have any \"edges\": any geodesic path can be extended arbitrarily far in either direction unless it runs into a gravitational singularity. Technically, this means that a maximally extended spacetime is either \"geodesically complete\" (meaning any geodesic can be extended to arbitrarily large positive or negative values of its 'affine parameter', which in the case of a timelike geodesic could just be the proper time), or if any geodesics are incomplete, it can only be because they end at a singularity. In order to satisfy this requirement, it was found that in addition to the black hole interior region (region II) which particles enter when they fall through the event horizon from the exterior (region I), there has to be a separate white hole interior region (region IV) which allows us to extend the trajectories of particles which an outside observer sees rising up \"away\" from the event horizon, along with a separate exterior region (region III) which allows us to extend some possible particle trajectories in the two interior regions. There are actually multiple possible ways to extend the exterior Schwarzschild solution into a maximally extended spacetime, but the Kruskal-Szekeres extension is unique in that it is a maximal, analytic, simply connected vacuum solution in which all maximally extended geodesics are either complete or else the curvature scalar diverges along them in finite affine time.\n\nIn the literature the Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates sometimes also appear in their lightcone variant:\nin which the metric is given by\nand \"r\" is defined implicitly by the equation\n\nThese lightcone coordinates have the useful feature that outgoing null geodesics are given by formula_51, while ingoing null geodesics are given by formula_52. Furthermore, the (future and past) event horizon(s) are given by the equation formula_53, and curvature singularity is given by the equation formula_54.\n\nThe lightcone coordinates derive closely from Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates.\n\n"}

He started the publications \"Pictorial Times\" and \"Illustrated Times\", wrote several books while working in Paris and Berlin as correspondent for the \"Illustrated London News\", and in 1887 founded a publishing house in London, Vizetelly and Company.\n\nVizetelly was born in London, the son of a printer. He was early apprenticed as a wood engraver, and one of his first blocks was a portrait of Old Parr. He was in San Francisco, California, when gold was discovered in 1849. His book \"California\" (written under the pseudonym \"J. Tyrwhittt Brooks\") recounts his adventures for four months in the gold fields. In his 1893 autobiography, \"Glances Back Through Seventy Years\", he admits it was an elaborate hoax, having never left London and wrote the book in just a few short weeks. \n\nIn 1843, encouraged by the success of the \"Illustrated London News\", Vizetelly, with his brother James Thomas Vizetelly (1817–1897) and Andrew Spottiswoode (1787–1866), started the \"Pictorial Times\", which was published successfully for several years. In 1855, in partnership with the bookseller David Bogue (1812-1856), he started a three-penny paper called the \"Illustrated Times\", which four years later was merged in the \"Penny Illustrated Paper\". His other brother, Frank Vizetelly (1830–1883) was a war artist for both sides during the American Civil War and went to Egypt as war correspondent for the \"Illustrated London News\". He was never heard of after the massacre of Hicks Pasha's army in Kordofan.\n\nIn 1865 Vizetelly became Paris correspondent for the \"Illustrated London News\". During the years he remained in Paris he published several books: \"Paris in Peril\" (1882), \"The Story of the Diamond Necklace\" (1867) and a free translation of Marius Topin's \"L'homme au masque de fer\" (1870) under the title \"The Man in the Iron Mask\".\n\nIn 1872 Vizetelly was transferred to Berlin, where he wrote \"Berlin under the New Empire\" (1879). In 1887 he established a publishing house in London, Vizetelly and Company, launching the Mermaid Series of reprints of English Elizabethan, Jacobean and Restoration drama, and issuing numerous translations of French and Russian authors. In 1888 he was prosecuted for obscene libel for his translation of Zola's \"La Terre\" (The Soil), and was fined £100; and when he reissued Zola's works in 1889 he was again prosecuted, fined £200, and imprisoned for three months.\n\nIn 1893 he wrote a volume of autobiographical reminiscence called \"Glances Back through Seventy Years\", a graphic picture of literary Bohemia in Paris and London between 1840 and 1870. He died on 1 January 1894 at \"Heatherlands\", Tilford, near Farnham in Surrey.\n\nHenry Vizetelly's interest in wines led to the creation of several books. \"The Wines of the World Characterized & Classed: with some particulars respecting the beers of Europe\" was published in 1875 and \"Facts About Champagne and Other Sparkling Wines Collected During Numerous Visits to the Champagne and Other Viticultural Districts of France, and the Principal Remaining Wine-Producing Countries of Europe\" was published in 1879. He was Wine Juror for Great Britain at the Vienna and Paris Exhibitions of 1873 and 1878. In 1882 he published \"A History of Champagne: with notes on the other sparkling wines of France\".\n\nHe had four sons by his first wife, notably Ernest Alfred Vizetelly (1853–1922) who reworked some of his father's Zola translations and published these bowdlerized versions in the 1890s. By his second wife, Elizabeth Anne Ansell, he had a daughter and a son, Frank Horace Vizetelly (1864–1938), who was a lexicographer, etymologist and editor.\n\nVizetelly was appointed knight of the Order of Franz Joseph.\n\n"}

She was the wife of Ilkhan Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan, and after him Hasan Buzurg, the first ruler of the Jalayirid Sultanate, and the mother of his son and successor Shaikh Awais.\n\nDilshad Khatun was the daughter of Demasq Kaja, and the granddaughter of Amir Chupan, who was the leading Mongol amir of the Ilkhanid period. Her mother was Tursin Khatun, daughter of Irinjin Kurkan, and Konchak Khatun, daughter of Ahmed Tekuder Khan, and Armini Khatun. She had three sisters, Sultan Bakht Khatun, Dendi Shah Khatun and Alam Shah Khatun. Her aunt was Baghdad Khatun, who was the wife firstly of Hasan Buzurg and after him of Abu Sa'id.\n\nAfter her father's death in 1327, Dilshad Khatun was brought under the protection of her aunt Baghdad, who had become wife of Abu Sa'id after having first been married to Hasan Buzurg. When Dilshad attained maturity Abu Sa'id fell in love with her. He divorced her aunt Baghdad Khatun, and married her in 1333. At the end of life, he was not happy with his wives, but Dilshad loved very much. Therefore, Baghdad became very jealous.\n\nAfter the Abu Sa'id's death in 1335, Arpa Ke'un, was chosen as his successor by the vizier, Ghiyas-al-Din Muhammad. Dilshad, who was pregnant with Abu Sa'id's child, fled to Amir Ali Padishah his uncle, leader of tribe of Oirad and governor of Diyarbakir. Her presence strengthened Ali Padishah's position. Seven months later, on 18 May 1336, she gave birth to a daughter.\n\nShortly afterward Ali Padishah was defeated and killed by Hasan, a rival claimant to the throne, who then married Dilshad. She bore Hasan, three sons: Shaikh Awais, who succeeded his father in 1356; Qasim, who died in 1367-68 and was buried in Najaf, and Zahid, who was born on 3 August 1351, shortly before his mother’s death, and died in 1371-72.\n\nDilshad brought about the death of Misr Khwaja, who had killed her father. Although married to Hasan, she remained to some extent a partisan of her Chobanid kinsmen, some of whom found temporary asylum in Baghdad. \n\nWhen, in the summer of 1347, her cousin Malek Ashraf led an expedition against the capital, she reportedly persuaded Hasan, who wanted to flee to the fortress of Komak on the Euphrates, to stay and defend the city. When the Chobanid army withdrew Dilshad prevented the Jalayirids from pursuit and even welcomed some of Malek Ashraf’s associates. \n\nDilshad Khatun enjoyed undisputed power over Jalayirid Iraq, as well as considerable influence in Syria. She was said to have been charitable to the poor.\n\nDilshad Khatun died on 27 December 1351, and was buried in Najaf.

Rainey\n\nLawrence Andrew Rainey (March 2, 1923 – November 8, 2002) was a native Mississippian who was elected Sheriff of Neshoba County, Mississippi during the 1960s. He gained notoriety for allegedly being involved in the June 1964 murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner. Rainey was a member of Mississippi's White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan\n\nAlan Parker's \"Mississippi Burning\" is a fictionalized version of the Freedom Summer Murders. It was released in 1988 and starred Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe.\n\nRainey died of cancer in 2002 and is buried next to his family in Kemper County, Mississippi.\n\nRainey grew up in Kemper and Neshoba County, Mississippi. His parents were John and Bessie Rainey. Rainey had a younger brother who died at a young age. Rainey's education stopped at the 8th grade which was not unusual in the early 20th century. His father was a farmer, and they were likely poor sharecroppers during the Great Depression. He worked as a mechanic before starting in a career in law enforcement.\n\nRainey started his career as a police officer working in Philadelphia, Mississippi. In October 1959, he shot and killed a black motorist who was getting out of his car on a violation, but he was not prosecuted. Rainey had a reputation as a brutal law enforcement officer.\n\nHe subsequently ran for and was elected to the office of Sheriff in 1963 and has been quoted as positioning himself as \"the man who can cope with situations that might arise\", a veiled reference to the racial tension in the area at the time. One of his deputies was Cecil Price.\n\nIn the afternoon of June 21, 1964, Chaney, Goodman, & Schwerner arrived at Longdale to inspect the burned out church in Neshoba County. They left Longdale around 3 p.m. They were to be in Meridian by 4 p.m. that day. The fastest route to Meridian was through Philadelphia. At the fork of Beacon & Main Street their station wagon sustained a flat tire. It is possible that a shot was fired at the station wagon's tire. Rainey's home was near the Beacon & Main Street fork. Deputy Cecil Price soon arrived and escorted them to the county jail. Price released the trio as soon as the longest day of the year became night which was about 10 p.m. The three were last seen heading south along Highway 19 toward Meridian.\n\nOn the day of the murders, Rainey was visiting his wife at the hospital in Meridian. He allegedly left Meridian about 6 p.m. for Collinsville where he had supper with relatives. Rainey visited his step-mother in Philadelphia and then went to his office to pick-up some clothing. He went to his home to pick up some gowns for his wife and left the gowns with his relatives in Collinsville. He watched television shows Bonanza and Candid Camera while in Collinsville. Rainey then returned to his home in Neshoba County. It is not clear, and was not proven in the subsequent trial, when he knew about the murders. It was alleged that he learned of the murder early the following morning and deliberately covered it up.\n\nOn July 18, 1964, Rainey sued NBC, the Lamar Life Broadcasting Company, Southern Television Corporation, and Buford W. Posey for one million dollars for slander due to an interview which Posey gave to NBC during the investigation of the disappearance of the civil rights workers. This lawsuit was unsuccessful.\n\nOn January 15, 1965, Rainey and seventeen others learned that they were indicted. Because there was, at that time, no federal murder statute, they were charged with violation of the three men's civil rights. In 1967, the case went to trial in federal court and Rainey was acquitted, though six others were convicted.\n\nDespite his acquittal, Rainey was stigmatized by his role in the events. Rainey's law enforcement career ended in 1968 when he was not re-elected as Sheriff of Neshoba County.\n\nAs a result of the trial, his wife became an alcoholic, and they divorced. She subsequently died of a brain tumor.\n\nFor years after the Freedom Summer Murders, Rainey had difficulty finding stable employment. His later careers included periods as auto mechanic and as a security guard in Kentucky and Mississippi. For years afterwards, Rainey worked as a security guard in Meridian, Mississippi. Some of Rainey's employers included the Matty Hersee state charity hospital, and the Village Fair Mall. A stint at the IGA grocery store was abruptly ended after the airing of the CBS program \"Attack on Terror\" in 1975: bomb threats were made against the supermarket for hiring him, and they subsequently fired him. His boss at McDonald's Security Guard Service was an African American, whom he described as \"better to work for than any white company\".\n\nHe later blamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the media for preventing him from finding and keeping jobs, and reiterated that he was not a racist.\n\nHe suffered from throat cancer and tongue cancer, and died in 2002 at the age of 79.\n\n\"\" was the first fictional version of the Freedom Summer Murders. Actor Geoffrey Lewis played as Sheriff Ed Duncan, a fictionalized Lawrence Rainey.\n\nIn the 1988 film \"Mississippi Burning\", the character of Sheriff Ray Stuckey was a fictionalized depiction of Lawrence Rainey.

TLN operates two time shifted feeds: East (Eastern Time) and West (Pacific Time), the latter is available via Bell Fibe TV and Rogers Cable in Ontario and New Brunswick.\n\nThe network broadcasts via the Anik F1-T25 at 107.3 degrees west, on the L-Band channel at 1221.75 MHz.\n\nTLN's Spanish-language foreign programming comes primarily from two broadcasters: Univision and CNN en Español. The Italian language programming is derived primarily from Canale 5, a channel owned by Mediaset- Italy's leading commercial broadcaster. TLN also airs some programming from SKY TG24, a news network in Italy and Video Italia, an Italian music service. English language programming on TLN primarily features characters and stars with an Italian or Hispanic background. Such programming includes \"The Sopranos\", \"Everybody Loves Raymond\", \"George Lopez\" and \"Lopez Tonight\".\n\nTLN broadcasts a substantial amount of soccer programming, airing Serie A matches since 1984. After some years without Serie A broadcast, TLN secured the rights to air all matches between 2018 and 2021. and UEFA Champions League matches involving Italian and Spanish teams from 2002 to 2009. In 2009, TLN secured the rights to the UEFA Europa League to become the exclusive Canadian broadcaster of this tournament through to 2012. TLN has also broadcast the last three editions of the Copa América, FIFA World Cup, and UEFA European Football Championship. It was announced in 2006 that TLN has partnered with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) to air matches from various FIFA tournaments, including the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, as the CBC was recently awarded the broadcast rights to various FIFA tournaments. Additionally, the TLN networks also hold the exclusive Canadian rights to Mexican Primera Division soccer, including games broadcast over the Univision networks in the U.S. In late 2015, TLN began showing games played by the Canadian national team for both 2018 World Cup qualification cycle and 2016 Olympic Qualifying tournament.\n\nTLN is also known to air Spanish-language erotica.

A dispute arose in 2003 when the head of RAI's international channel, decided to repudiate RAI's supply obligations as well as its 2001 agreement to launch a 24-hour RAI Canada channel, in favour of challenging Canada's regulatory regime by indicating that it wanted to deliver RAI programming through its own international channel on its own terms without restriction and not through TLN or through any Canadian programming partner. Later in the same year, RAI pulled its content from TLN and petitioned the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to allow it to broadcast RAI International in Canada. This effort was backed by Rogers Communications, who sponsored RAI's application to get on the CRTC's approved list.

It also represents their descendants. According to Akilathirattu Ammanai, it additionally represents one who lives with Dignity.\n\nSantror Makkal is an alternative name for The Santror, frequently used in Akilathirattu Ammanai.\n\nSantror Pirappu (The Birth of Santror): according to Ayyavazhi mythology, Thirumal, one of the three godheads, made Saptha Kanniyar (seven virgins) give birth to seven boys. This event is described here.\n\nThe Seven Virgins were faithful devotees of Sivan. They regularly served at his feet a lump of water that they could miraculously gather in their hands. This water came from the mythical river Ayotha Amirtha Gangai in which they bathed daily.\n\nOne day, Thirumal came upon these women and asked them to serve him instead of Sivan for a day. The women refused to his request, insisting they would only serve the all-powerful Sivan. Having been refused, Thirumal vowed to teach them a lesson while still fulfilling the divine plan of bringing forth his children through them. He then took seven seeds from the Seven Logas above. When the women left the river after their baths, he caused the gentle cold wind (Vayu) to blow and the rain (Varuna) to lightly fall. When the women were shivering, Thirumal appeared to them again, this time in the form of fire. The women immediately encircled the flame. Thirumal then placed the seven seeds inside the wombs of each of the women. They instantly conceived and delivered seven boys. They were called Santror Makkal.\n\nRealizing that they were delayed in their service to Sivan, the women left the infants in the river in a fist of fear and rushed to gather the water. Yet they could only gather the water in the shape of a mere ball. It was then they realized that they had been deceived. Not only could they not serve the feet of Sivan but they also could not raise the boys. They undertook a rigorous Tavam and awaited the manifestation of Thirumal as Ayya Vaikundar in Kali Yukam. He had promised to marry them and to make their sons rulers of the land by destroying the Kalineesan and Kalimayai.\n\nIn The Naming Ceremony of Santror, Thirumal, acting as a Pantaram, made the Seven Virgins, who were to give birth to seven boys using seven seeds from seven upper worlds. The seven sons were reared personally by Thirumal.\n\nOne day, a grand ceremony was organized for the naming of the children. The whole pantheon of Gods and Goddesses attended the ceremony.\n\nThe eminent God Isvaran gave them the first name as Chanars because, one of the characteristics of these people was ‘perseverance in seeking and obtaining even the invisible goal’. The sage Vetha \"(Vethamuni)\" gave a name as Santror to signify the characteristics of nobility and integrity, Thirumal called them as Natalvar. Similarly, other gods and goddesses gave them very prestigious titular names. Having named them with great attributes, all the deities sang lullabies in praise of their glory. Sarasvati, the popular deity, praised them as children born with powers of knowledge, wisdom, and artistic skills and as the future kings who were going to rule the earth with justice, righteousness, and love.\n\nAccording to Ayyavazhi mythology the Santror Makkal born of Seven Virgins were named and after the naming ceremony, Shiva and Thirumal, wanting to feed the children with celestial nectar, commanded the celestial attendants to bring the same. When they went to bring the nectar, they found it emptied by a priest and his wife who while ‘dressing themselves as per the rules of the scriptures’, had been drinking the whole measures of nectar to their full. By this, they had increased the fat in their own body, depriving others of their share. When the celestial attendants reported this matter to Shiva and Thirumal, the later rebuked the Priest and his wife, and made them grow as Palmyra trees on earth to feed his children perpetually by giving back the Celestial nectar in the form of Palm-juice.\n\nNow, the illustrious deity Badrakali, being commissioned by Isvaran to subdue Takkan, a wicked ruler who had squeezed the labour of the people, stood in tavam to get the sons of Mayon (Thirumal) to support her in her battle. Granting the prayer, the children were entrusted to Badrakali to be fostered with full dignity and honour. She was warned that in case of any danger befalling the sons, she would be imprisoned once for all. Badrakali accepted the condition, and received the sons. As per the instruction of Isvaran, she taught them various martial arts, occupational skills, and fine arts. The children grew into adults, made progress in different trades and occupations. They also became adept at fighting wars. Once they excelled in war, Badrakali took them to wage the war against Takkan, and in the war, they crushed the forces of the enemy with extraordinary courage and valour.\n\nAs the seven sons attained the age of marriage, Badrakali arranged for their marriage with the seven daughters of Nirupathirajan, the famous king. The nuptial ceremony, being attended by the whole assembly of divinities, took place with all pomp and glory, having the brides and bridegrooms dressed in exquisite clothes and adorned with glistering ornaments. The couples lived happily under the tutelage of Badrakali and their progenies flourished. They undertook the trades of precious metals that earned them quite opulence. They excelled in martial prowess and were sought after by the kings of Chola kingdom. Even as they were living with fame and name, they drew their strength and courage from the milk they obtained from the palmyra tree that supported them. All these events took place during the last phase of the Dwapara Yukam.\n\n\n"}

Patterson walked up behind Oates and shot him in the back of the head with a .38-caliber pistol. He left, but returned shortly later and shot Harris who had come outside screaming upon hearing the shots and finding Oates. Patterson then went to a friend's house where he took off his clothing and was arrested standing naked in the street. No clear motive was established for the murders, but a friend of Oates told police that Patterson and the victim had once argued over who was the better football player, Patterson or Oates' son.\n\nPatterson received a rare recommendation from the Texas Board of Pardon and Paroles that his death sentence be commuted to life on May 17, 2004 because of mental illness. Nonetheless, Governor Rick Perry refused to grant the commutation. Governor Perry explained why he refused to commute Patterson's sentence to life, \"This defendant is a very violent individual. Texas has no life without parole sentencing option, and no one can guarantee this defendant would never be freed to commit other crimes were his sentence commuted. In the interests of justice and public safety, I am denying the defendant's request for clemency and a stay.\"\n\nPrior to Patterson's execution, Texas had only two sentencing options for capital crimes: life with parole (with a minimum prison time of 40 years) or death by lethal injection; it did not have a life without parole option. Partially in response to the execution, in 2005, the Texas Legislature changed the capital murder sentencing law, which Governor Perry signed into law. Under the new law, the life with parole option was replaced with life without parole. (However, for any unsolved cases prior to the change in law, in the event of a conviction the life with parole option still applies.)\n\nPatterson was pronounced dead at 6:20 p.m.\n\n"}

For the Confederate States Army, the system was fragile and was designed for short hauls of cotton to the nearest river or ocean port. During the war, new parts were hard to obtain, and the system deteriorated from overuse, lack of maintenance, and systematic destruction by Union raiders.\n\nThe outbreak of war had a depressing effect on the economic fortunes of the Confederate railroad industry. With the cotton crop being hoarded under the \"King Cotton\" theory, railroads lost their main source of income. Many were forced to lay off employees, and in particular, let go skilled technicians and engineers. Due to a general opinion that the war would not last long, initially Confederate rail operators did not seek, nor build, alternative sources of iron for rail construction and repair.\n\nAlthough railroad contracts to port towns had ceased, due to the combined effects of the cotton export policy and the Union naval blockade, lucrative government contracts were doled out to rail operators with lines supplying men and arms to the front line of Tennessee and Virginia. A consortium of rail operators had decided upon a universal rate for government contracts; \"a uniform rate of two cents a mile for men and half the regular local rate for munitions, provisions, and material, and also agreed to accept Confederate bonds at par in payment of government transportation.\"\n\nIn addition, the Confederacy suffered from two key deficiencies in its rail network. First was the route structure: it was built to serve the coastal shipping industry, and most rail lines connected ports and river terminals to points inland. This lack of inter-railway connections made many railroads useless once the Union blockade was in place. Second was break of gauge; much of the Confederate rail network was in the broad gauge format, but much of North Carolina and Virginia had standard gauge lines. Sometimes, as with Montgomery, Alabama, a city was served by two railroads with different gauge and different depots, meaning that through cargo had to be unloaded from one railroad and moved by animal-powered transportation to the other company's station, where it would be re-loaded. Southern railroads west of the Mississippi were isolated, disconnected, and differed widely in gauge. Several of the Northern railroads, in contrast, were complex networks in themselves, and many cities were served by more than one. The fact that most used the same gauge made transfer even easier.\n\nAs troop movement began in earnest in May and June 1861, a crippling problem was discovered; many rail lines terminated in towns without connecting to continuing lines. Instead, cargo would have to be unloaded, driven across town, and then reloaded. Soldiers and other passengers would often have to stay overnight to catch a continuing train the next day. When the Confederate government attempted to rectify this problem, they ran into local opposition. Towns preferred the lack of connection which, under the principle of the negative railroad, required the hiring of teamsters and hotel rooms. Railroad operators, while not opposed to connecting lines, were opposed to the possibility of sharing rolling stock with rival companies.\n\nConfederate raids on the Union's most relevant railroad company, the B & O, devastated tracks and rolling stock; the line quit running. However, the North had enough industrial resources to restore operations.\n\nAs 1862 opened, the Confederacy built a spur off the Orange and Alexandria Railroad at Manassas Junction toward Centreville, Virginia known as the Centreville Military Railroad. It served to supply the Confederate defenses on the Centreville Plateau along the north side of the Bull Run feed into the Occoquan River.\n\nAs the war waged on, attempts were made by railroad operators to acquire railroad supplies abroad, necessitated by the Confederacy's small industrial base. The problem of supplies had become increasingly acute, especially with respect to the already small supply of engines and cars. Stressed by overuse, lacking material to make repairs, and the conscription of men who could make them, rail operators were predicting a breaking point as early as 1862. While railroad operators attempted, throughout the war, to get assistance from the Confederate Congress, the response was either indifferent or hostile.\n\nIn mid-1863 the Confederate government finally initiated an overall policy concerning railroads, and even then it was confined solely to aiding the war effort rather than shoring up the weakening economy of the Confederate States of America. New legislation allowed commandeering (under the name of \"impressment\"), which brought railroads and their rolling stock under the de facto control of the military. Meanwhile, Union victory in the Chattanooga Campaign gave the United States Military Railroad full control of the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad which after repairs supplied the Atlanta Campaign.\n\nIn March 1864, the Confederate Quartermaster-General's Department ordered all passenger trains to give governmental trains the right of way. By mid-1864, all passenger service in the Confederacy had come to a standstill. Transport of goods for civilian use was also affected, exacerbating shortages brought on by wartime devastation, speculation, hoarding, and the Confederacy's impressment policy.\n\nIn the last year before the end of the war, the Confederate railroad system was always on the verge of collapse. The impressment policy of quartermasters ran the rails ragged. Feeder lines would be scrapped for replacement steel for trunk lines, and the continual use of rolling stock wore them down faster than they could be replaced.\n\nAs the Union armies pushed further into Confederate territory, they came into possession of former Confederate railway lines, or what was left of them. Confederate troops generally applied a scorched-earth policy towards railroads when they were in retreat. Union troops would often have to rebuild an entire line from scratch for it to be usable. Late in 1862, when Confederate forces devastated the Mississippi Central Railroad, the Union invasion came to an end. Grant later resumed the attack, pursuing the Vicksburg Campaign along the river, where steamboats could bring supplies. \n\nSherman's March to the Sea in late 1864 reversed the roles, the Union army destroying the main line of the Georgia Railroad and others. Due to the vagaries of the war, some lines would be rebuilt six or seven times by differing sides, especially in states like Virginia, where fighting was most intense.\n\nAttempts were made to enlarge the Confederacy's rail system by adding or connecting lines. Of the three major rail projects the Confederate congress proposed and funded, only one of them, a connection between Danville, Virginia, and Greensboro, North Carolina, was completed. Although the Confederate constitution forbade internal improvements to aid commerce, nothing within it said anything about improvements to aid wartime defense.\n\n\n"}

In the mid-nineteenth century, the toy industry contributed to the town’s industrial development, and remains important today.\n\nIn 1935 the city of Zirndorf applied to the German Reich Administration to have a caserne built here. The application was approved, with the condition of Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, that construction must be in the Franconian style. The plans were prepared by the Construction Office of the German Air Force, and work began on the Barracks in the spring of 1938. It was completed in mid-1940. This Spotlight and Anti-Aircraft Barracks as it was then called, was one of the best military training barracks in the Third Reich.\n\nIn 1945, soldiers of the U.S. 26th Infantry Regiment occupied the barracks. On 11 May 1949, this barracks was renamed in honor of John J. Pinder Jr., an American soldier who fell in a battle near Colleville-sur-Mer, France, on 6 June 1944. For his bravery, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.\n\nIn the decades since 1945, many American units were stationed at Pinder Barracks.

In 1997 Sumitomo gained agreement to use the Dunlop name in its corporate name, and changed the name of its UK subsidiary to Dunlop Tyres Ltd.\n\nIn 1999, Sumitomo and Goodyear began a joint venture by which Sumitomo continued to manufacture all Japanese-made tyres under the Dunlop name, while Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company bought 75% of the European and North American tyre businesses of Sumitomo.\n\nThe company has extensive manufacturing operations throughout the world. With the closure of the Washington plant in 2006, Goodyear Dunlop ceased mainstream car and lorry tyre production in the UK.\n\nIn 2016, it was announced that Sumitomo Rubber Industries would commence the second phase of its 131 million investment for the upgrade and expansion of its Dunlop tire manufacturing plant in Ladysmith, South Africa.\n\nUntil May 2014, Goodyear Dunlop occupied a compact part of the site with their British main office. In the UK, the company operates as a sales organisation, importing tyres from manufacturing plants around the world, including China, Slovenia and Poland.\n\nThe Goodyear Dunlop joint venture is managed from sites in Luxembourg and Brussels, which report to Goodyear in Akron, Ohio, United States.\n\nFort Dunlop was a motorsport manufacturing operation located in a corner of the original Dunlop factory in Erdington, Birmingham, established in 1891 until May 2014. This factory produced specialised vintage, motorcycle and touring car tyres, and produced about 300,000 specialised racing tyres per year. On 30 May 2014, the Birmingham factory ceased tyre production, ending Dunlop tyre production in the UK.\n\n"}

People are born at the age of one, i.e. the first year of lifetime using an ordinal numeral (instead of \"zero\" using a cardinal numeral), and on Chinese New Year or New Year's Day one year is added to their age. Since age is incremented at the beginning of the lunar or solar year, rather than on the anniversary of a birthday, people may be one or two years older in Asian reckoning than in the international age system.\n\nUnder the traditional reckoning in China, age changes on the first day of Chinese New Year. In Japan and South Korea, New Year's Day is used as the date of change of age for the traditional system.\n\nIn either the traditional or modern age system the word \"\" (), meaning \"years of age\", is used for age counting. When a person's age is given in a publication, it is often specified whether it is his or her:\nOf the three, only 周歲/周岁 (Chinese), \"\" (pinyin) = \"round age\" may be used as a count word.\n\nWhen a child has survived one month of life (29 days if lunar month reckoning) a \"mun yuet\" () celebration can be observed, in which duck or chicken eggs dyed red are distributed to guests to signify fertility.\n\nThe traditional Japanese system of age reckoning, or ' (, lit. \"counted years\"), which incremented one's age on New Year's Day, was rendered obsolete by law in 1902 when Japan officially adopted the modern age system, known in Japanese as \"\" (). However, the traditional system was still commonly used, so in 1950 another law was established to encourage people to use the modern age system.\n\nToday the traditional system is used only by the elderly and in rural areas. Elsewhere its use is limited to traditional ceremonies, divinations, and obituaries.\n\nJapanese uses the word \"sai\" ( or ) as a counter word for both the traditional and modern age system.\n\nKoreans who use the traditional system refer to their age in units called \"sal\" (살), using Korean numerals in ordinal form. Thus, a person is one \"sal\" (\"han sal\", 한살) during the first calendar year of life, and ten \"sal\" during the tenth calendar year.\n\nThe 100th-day anniversary of a baby is called \"\" (, ) which literally means \"a hundred days\" in Korean, and is given a special celebration, marking the survival of what was once a period of high infant mortality. The first anniversary of birth named \"dol\" (돌) is likewise celebrated, and given even greater significance. South Koreans celebrate their birthdays, even though every South Korean gains one 'sal' on New Year's Day. Because the first year comes at birth and the second on the first day of the New Year, children born, for example, on December 29 will reach two years of age on the New Year's Day, when they are only days old. Hence, everyone born on the same calendar year effectively has the same age and can easily be calculated by the formula: Age = (Current Year − Birth Year) + 1\n\nIn modern South Korea the traditional system is used alongside the international age system which is referred to as \"\"man-nai\"\" (만나이) in which \"\"man\"\" (만) means \"full\" or \"actual\", and \"\"nai\"\" (나이) meaning \"age\". For example, ' means \"full ten years\", or \"ten years old\" in English. The Korean word ' means \"years elapsed\", identical to the English \"years old\", but is only used to refer to the first few birthdays. ' or simply ' refers to the first Western-equivalent birthday, \" refers to the second, and so on.\n\nThe traditional system has not been used in modern North Korea since the 1980s. South Korea is now considered as the only country that uses the East Asian age in the world and the term itself is well known as \"Korean age\" globally, rather than the East Asian age.\n\nThe Korean Birthday Celebrations by the lunar calendar is called ' (음력 생일, 陰曆生日) and ' (양력 생일, 陽曆生日) is the birthday by Gregorian calendar. In the past, most people used the lunar calendar, ', to tell their birthday more than the Gregorian calendar ' but nowadays Koreans, especially young generations, tend to use \" for telling their birthdates.\n\nFor official government uses, documents, and legal procedures, the international system is used. Regulations regarding age limits on beginning school, as well as the age of consent, are all based on this system (\"man-nai\"). The age limit for tobacco, alcohol use are after January 1 of the year one's age turns to 19.\n\nIn Eastern Mongolia, age is traditionally determined based on the number of full moons since conception for girls, and the number of new moons since birth for boys.\n\n\n\n"}

Riddles. It had the same power output as the 2-8-0 but a lighter axle load, making it suitable for secondary lines.\n\nIt had a parallel boiler and round-topped firebox. While the 2-8-0 had a narrow firebox, the 2-10-0 had a wide firebox placed above the driving wheels. This arrangement was common in the United States (e.g. the USRA 0-8-0) but unusual in Britain, where wide fireboxes were usually used only where there was a trailing bogie, e.g. in 4-4-2 and 4-6-2 types. These were the first 2-10-0 locomotives to work in Great Britain, and the first major class of ten-coupled engines — they had been preceded by two 0-10-0 locomotives; the Great Eastern Railway's Decapod and the Midland Railway's Lickey Banker. The 2-10-0 wheel arrangement was later used by Riddles when he designed the BR standard class 9F. This, too, had a wide firebox placed above the driving wheels.\n\nTwo batches were built by the North British Locomotive Company, the first batch of 100 introduced in 1943/1944 and the second batch of 50 in 1945. Their WD Nos were 3650–3749 (later 73650–73749), and 73750–73799.\n\n20 of the first batch were sent to the Middle East. During running-in they worked in Britain, but their length made them unsuitable. Most saw service with the British Army in France after D-Day.\n\nAfter the war the 150 locomotives were distributed as follows, the majority going to the Netherlands:\n\nIn 1946, the Netherlands bought those in continental Europe. They formed the NS 5000 class, and were numbered 5001-103. They had a short working life, the last being withdrawn in 1952.\n\nAfter the war, the British Railways (BR) bought twenty-five locomotives. These were initially numbered 73774-73798 but later re-numbered 90750-74. They were mostly operated by BR's Scottish Region on heavy freight trains and were all withdrawn between 1961 and 1962.\n\nSixteen of the twenty Middle East locomotives went to Greece, where they formed Class Λβ of the Hellenic State Railways, numbered Λβ951 to Λβ966.\n\nThe remaining 4 Middle East locomotives remained in Syria and operated on the Chemins de Fer Syriens (CFS). These engines formed the CFS Class 150.6.\n\nIn the 1952 WD renumbering scheme, the two remaining in WD service (at the Longmoor Military Railway), Nos. 73651 and 73797, were renumbered 600 and 601 respectively. The also received names: 600 \"Gordon\" and 601 \"Kitchener\".\n\nLMR 600 Gordon has survived and has been steamed on the Severn Valley Railway, though it is out of service, cosmetically restored and on display in the Engine House.\n\nTwo more have been repatriated from Greece. One has been numbered 90775, one higher than the last BR engine, and has carried the name \"Sturdee\" (as WD/LMR No. 601 before being numbered 90775) and is operational on North Norfolk Railway where it has now been renamed \"The Royal Norfolk Regiment\" as of 2017. The other is WD No. (7)3672 which has been named \"Dame Vera Lynn\". The loco is currently being overhauled in a headshunt at Grosmont, NYMR.\n\nThe 4th one in preservation WD 73755 (NS 5085) survives in the Dutch Railway Museum (Nederlands Spoorwegmuseum) in Utrecht. It carried the nameplate \"Longmoor\", after the Royal Engineer's base at Longmoor, with the coat of arms of the Royal Engineers above.\n\nSix locomotives remain in various states in Greece with Λβ962 and Λβ964 operating mainline tours on the Drama to Xanthi line.

{"id": "2089237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089237", "title": "Bramwell Booth", "text": "Bramwell Booth\n\nWilliam Bramwell Booth, CH (8 March 1856 – 16 June 1929) was the first Chief of Staff (1881–1912) and the second General of The Salvation Army (1912–1929), succeeding his father, William Booth.\n\nBorn in Halifax, Yorkshire, England, the oldest child born to William Booth and Catherine Mumford, he had two brothers and five sisters, including Evangeline Booth, Catherine Booth-Clibborn, Emma Booth and Ballington Booth. The Booth family regularly moved from place to place as William Booth's ministry necessitated until the family finally settled in London in 1865. Bramwell Booth was involved in The Salvation Army right from its origins as the obscure Christian Mission, established in Whitechapel in 1865, into an international organisation with numerous and varied social activities. He was educated at home, briefly at a preparatory school and at the City of London School, where he was bullied.\n\nKnown to his family as 'Willie', as a youth he suffered poor health and had a slight hearing loss. In 1870, aged just 14, Bramwell Booth started to help in the management of his father's Christian Mission and in the cheap food kitchens set up in its early days. He had intended to study medicine and had a fear of public speaking, but despite these obstacles he became William Booth's amanuensis, adviser and administrator. He became an active full-time collaborator with his father in 1874, and an officer when the Christian Mission became The Salvation Army in 1878.\n\nThe name \"The Salvation Army\" developed from an incident in May 1878. William Booth was dictating a letter to his secretary George Scott Railton and said, \"We are a volunteer army.\" Bramwell Booth heard his father and said, \"Volunteer? I'm no volunteer, I'm a regular!\" Railton was instructed to cross out the word \"volunteer\" and substitute the word \"salvation\".\n\nIn 1881, General William Booth appointed Bramwell as his Chief of the Staff of The Salvation Army. Bramwell would hold this title until his father's death, when he himself was named General in his father's will. In 1885 Bramwell was involved with William Thomas Stead in an attempt to publicise the prostitution of young girls. The lurid revelations of how thirteen-year-old Eliza Armstrong was sold for £5 resulted in the 1885 Criminal Law Amendment Act, which raised the age of consent to sixteen years. After the revelations, Booth, Stead, and Rebecca Jarrett, a converted brothel-keeper who assisted them, were arrested on several charges. Booth was acquitted but the others served short prison terms.\n\nOn 12 October 1882 Bramwell married Captain Florence Eleanor Soper, the eldest daughter of Dr Soper, a medical practitioner of Blaina, Monmouthshire. The congregation at Clapton Congress Hall were charged one shilling each for admission to the ceremony. She had joined The Salvation Army in 1880 and worked in France with Bramwell's sister Catherine Booth. After her marriage she took charge of the women's social work. All of their seven children (five daughters and two sons) became active workers in the army. Their eldest child was Commissioner Catherine Bramwell-Booth.\n\nUpon his death in 1912, William Booth appointed Bramwell his successor as General, by way of a sealed envelope. This process was the legal way in which a successor to the General was chosen, as outlined by the Christian Mission's founding deed of 1878. Like his father, Bramwell Booth ruled autocratically, and expected complete obedience. However, what officers had tolerated from William Booth, by then known as 'The Founder', they would not tolerate from Bramwell.\n\nThe early years of Bramwell Booth's Generalship were complicated by World War I, which threatened the international nature of The Salvation Army, with Salvationists in both Germany and Great Britain. However, he was able to steer a course that offended neither the Germans nor outraged British public opinion, saying in his Christmas message of 1915, \"Every land is my fatherland, for all lands are my Father's.\".\n\nLike his father before him, Bramwell would not tolerate any perceived insubordination and he summarily retired Salvation Army officers with little reason or sent officers too young to be retired to distant appointments; such officers were said to be in 'the freezer'. Bramwell faced allegations of nepotism, in that he appointed his own children to posts for which others were better qualified. This system could be seen as being inherited from his father, who similarly appointed his own children to high ranking positions. This led to accusations that The Salvation Army was a Booth family-business; however, William Booth had once said to his children that \"The Salvation Army does not belong to you, or to me, it belongs to the world\" and was very wary of the leadership of the Army becoming a dynasty.\n\nDiscontent simmered among Salvation Army senior officers, including the chief-of-the-staff Edward Higgins and George Carpenter, who incidentally had been sent to 'the freezer' by his appointment to Sydney in a role he previously held 22 years earlier. These two officers later became Generals of The Salvation Army. Another notable Army leader that disagreed with Bramwell's leadership was Commissioner Charles Jeffries who would later be British Commissioner. In his final years as General he increasingly gave control of The Salvation Army to his wife, Florence Booth, who was given power of attorney when he was away travelling. She had been the Army's 'First Lady' since the death of his mother Catherine Booth in 1890, and had started several Army organisations including the Home League, Girl Guards, and League of Mercy.\n\nAs the years passed the Army's senior officers, including Bramwell's sister Evangeline Booth and his former brother-in-law Frederick Booth-Tucker, began to question his leadership. In May 1928 Bramwell's health began to deteriorate, and by September he was suffering from insomnia and depression. His poor health offered those in the Army who were dissatisfied with his leadership an opportunity to act, and on 8 January 1929 the first High Council of The Salvation Army convened, and firstly asked the General to resign due to his ill health, which, they said, was hampering him in the performance of his duties and decisions. He refused to resign, believing that his health would soon be fully recovered, so on 13 February 1929 the High Council voted by 52 votes to 5 that Bramwell's term of office as General should now end, based on Bramwell being 'unfit' to hold the position. Booth was succeeded in the election of Edward Higgins, his Chief of the Staff.\nGeneral Bramwell Booth then took the High Council to court, which lost him a lot of respect; he also lost the court case. His sister, Evangeline Booth later succeeded General Higgins to serve as the fourth General of The Salvation Army. Henceforth the General of The Salvation Army would be elected by the High Council.\n\nOn 29 April 1929 the now former General Bramwell Booth received a letter from Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin stating that King George V had appointed him a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour.\n\nBooth was a vegetarian. He authored the booklet \"The Advantages of Vegetarian Diet\", published by the London Vegetarian Society. In 1925, it was reprinted by the Order of the Golden Age. Booth suggested nineteen reasons for adopting vegetarianism. He commented that a vegetarian diet is \"favourable to purity, chastity, and a perfect control of the appetites and passions.\"\n\nBooth's wife also became a vegetarian and they both believed that meat stimulated the consumption of alcohol.\n\nOn 16 June 1929 his family was summoned to his bedside, and on that Sunday evening General Bramwell Booth died at his home, The Homestead, Hadley Wood, near Barnet, Hertfordshire. For the Friday and Saturday following his death Bramwell Booth's body lay in state at The Salvation Army's Congress Hall. On the Saturday evening 10,000 Salvationists and friends filled the Royal Albert Hall to bid farewell to their beloved former General.\n\nGeneral Bramwell Booth was buried opposite his parents at Abney Park Cemetery, Stoke Newington, London. The grave lies near the southern entrance. Huge crowds attended his funeral. He was commemorated by the Bramwell Booth Memorial Hall, Queen Victoria Street, London.\n"}

Unveiled at the end of 1993, at the behest of amateur racer Giampiero Moretti (owner of the MOMO auto parts business), the 333 SP marked Ferrari's official return to sports car racing after a 20-year absence. The car was built to compete in the IMSA's new WSC class, which replaced the previous GTP cars.\n\nA total of 40 chassis were built, the first 14 by Dallara and the remaining 26 by Michelotto. It is believed that 27 chassis were raced, between 1994 and 2003.\n\nWhile the 333 SP was in its planning stages, Ferrari contracted Italian motor racing manufacturer Dallara to assist with its development. Dallara provided the transmission and suspension, and were also responsible for aerodynamic development and bodywork construction. The gearbox used Hewland mechanical parts, housed within a custom-built Dallara casing. Ferrari developed the chassis tub and engine in-house. British race car engineering consultant Tony Southgate joined the project in early 1994 and went on to help design and run the cars until the end of 1995.\n\nThe engine was a modified version of the 65 degree V12 engine used in the 1990 Ferrari 641 Formula One car, enlarged to 4.0 L and producing . Southgate later described it as \"one of the most reliable race engines I have ever worked with.\"\n\nThe car debuted in the third round of the 1994 IMSA GT Championship at Road Atlanta, securing the first two places. Four cars were allocated to three teams, Euromotorsport, Momo Corse, and Team Scandia. In the following round, at Lime Rock, the Italian cars monopolized the podium, and would take three more wins until the end of the season. However, due to Ferrari starting the season late, they were beaten by Oldsmobile to the makes' championship, and Andy Evans was the best placed Ferrari driver at fifth in the drivers' championship.\n\nIn 1995, the 333 SP took its revenge. Although proving unreliable at the 24 Hours of Daytona, it took top honors at the 12 Hours of Sebring before securing another four wins. With the four cars taking more consistent results, Ferrari won the makes championship and Fermín Velez won the drivers title, with Mauro Baldi and Wayne Taylor taking third and fourth, respectively. The car also made its debut at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, but was never competitive in the French race, its best result a 6th spot in .\n\nThe following year the car was still competitive and tied with Oldsmobile in the constructors championship but lost on a tie-breaker, as well as allowing ex-F1 driver Max Papis to score a final second place and Didier Theys a fourth in the drivers championship, even though the 333 SP won only two races. In 1997, the Ferrari won again at Sebring and took another four wins. However, the car was losing its competitiveness against the more modern Riley & Scott, and taking 4th, 5th and 6th in the drivers championship and second in the makes was the best it could with a four-year-old design.\n\nIn 1998, the car was slightly updated, and found new life in the International Sports Racing Series (later called FIA Sportscar Championship), winning every race and scoring the championship's two top spots with the winners Emmanuel Collard and Vincenzo Sospiri and runners-up Didier Theys and Fredy Lienhard. In America, the car won three rounds in the IMSA Championship (including Sebring) and took Wayne Taylor to second in the final standings while Ferrari won the makes championship. In the rival USRRC Can-Am championship, the 333 SP finally managed to take the Daytona 24 Hours crown.\n\nStarting from 1999, the car found its niche in the European races, as the newly introduced American Le Mans Series saw factory-backed Audi and BMW entries dominating against privateer Ferraris. The cars were consistently outclassed in the ALMS races, and in 2000 Doran Racing even fit a Judd engine in an attempt to stay competitive. However, across the Atlantic, the 333 SP was the car to own, and in 1999, Collard and Sospiri renewed their ISRS title, edging out Christian Pescatori, who won the following year, with David Terrien, making it three championships in a row for the JMB Racing-entered Ferrari.\n\nAs the 333 SP became outdated in chassis, engine and aerodynamics, it gradually disappeared from international sports car racing.

{"id": "2089272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089272", "title": "The Price of Salt", "text": "The Price of Salt\n\nThe Price of Salt (later republished under the title Carol) is a 1952 romance novel by Patricia Highsmith, first published under the pseudonym \"Claire Morgan\". Highsmith—known as a suspense writer based on her psychological thriller \"Strangers on a Train\"—used an alias because she did not want to be tagged as \"a lesbian-book writer\", and because of the use of her own life references for characters and occurrences in the story. Though Highsmith had many sexual and romantic relationships with women and wrote over 22 novels and numerous short stories, \"The Price of Salt\" is her only novel about an unequivocal lesbian relationship and its relatively happy ending was unprecedented in lesbian literature. It is also notable for being the only one of her novels with \"a conventional 'happy ending and characters who had \"more explicit sexual existences\".\n\nA British radio adaptation of the novel was broadcast in 2014. \"Carol\", a film adaptation nominated for six Academy Awards and nine British Academy Film Awards, was released in 2015.\n\nTherese Belivet is a lonely young woman, just beginning her adult life in Manhattan and looking for her chance to launch her career as a theatre set designer. When she was a small girl, her widowed mother sent her to an Episcopalian boarding school, leaving her with a sense of abandonment. Therese is dating Richard, a young man she does not love and does not enjoy having sex with. On a long and monotonous day at work in the toy section of a department store during the Christmas season, Therese becomes interested in a customer, an elegant and beautiful woman in her early thirties. The woman's name is Carol Aird and she gives Therese her address so her purchases may be delivered. On an impulse, Therese sends her a Christmas card. Carol, who is going through a difficult separation and divorce and is herself quite lonely, unexpectedly responds. The two begin to spend time together. Therese develops a strong attachment to Carol. Richard accuses Therese of having a \"schoolgirl crush\", but Therese knows it is more than that: She is in love with Carol.\n\nCarol's husband, Harge, is suspicious of Carol's relationship with Therese, whom he meets briefly when Therese stays over at Carol's house in New Jersey. Carol had previously admitted to Harge that she had a short-lived sexual relationship months earlier with her best friend, Abby. Harge takes his and Carol's daughter Rindy to live with him, limiting Carol's access to her as divorce proceedings continue. To escape from the tension in New York, Carol and Therese take a road trip West as far as Utah, over the course of which it becomes clear that the feelings they have for each other are romantic and sexual. They become physically as well as emotionally intimate and declare their love for each other.\n\nThe women become aware that a private investigator is following them, hired by Harge to gather evidence that could be used against Carol by incriminating her as homosexual in the upcoming custody hearings. They realize the investigator has already bugged the hotel room in which Carol and Therese first had sex. On a road in Nebraska, after the detective has followed them for miles and clearly intends to continue doing so, Carol confronts him and demands that he hand over any evidence against her. She pays him a high price for some tapes even though he warns her that he has already sent several tapes and other evidence to Harge in New York. Carol knows that she will lose custody of Rindy if she continues her relationship with Therese. She decides to return to New York to fight for her rights regarding her daughter, and will return to Therese as soon as she can. Therese stays alone in the Midwest; eventually Carol writes to tell her that she has agreed to not continue their relationship. \n\nThe evidence for Carol's homosexuality is so strong that she capitulates to Harge without having the details of her behavior aired in court. She submits to an agreement that gives him full custody of Rindy and leaves her with limited supervised visits.\n\nThough heartbroken, Therese returns to New York to rebuild her life. Therese and Carol arrange to meet again. Therese, still hurt that Carol abandoned her in a hopeless attempt to maintain a relationship with Rindy, declines Carol's invitation to live with her. They part, each headed for a different evening engagement. Therese, after a brief flirtation with an English actress that leaves her ashamed, quickly reviews her relationships —\"loneliness swept over her like a rushing wind\"— and goes to find Carol, who greets her more eagerly than ever before.\n\nAccording to Highsmith, the novel was inspired by a blonde woman in a mink coat who ordered a doll from her while Highsmith was working as a temporary sales clerk in the toy section of Bloomingdale's in New York City during Christmas season of 1948:\nHighsmith recalled completing the book's outline in two hours that night, likely under the influence of chickenpox which she discovered she had only the next day: \"fever is stimulating to the imagination.\" She completed the novel by 1951. The semi-autobiographical story was mined from her own life references and desire for a lost love. Highsmith described the character of Therese as having come \"from my own bones\". Playwright Phyllis Nagy, who met Highsmith in 1987 and developed a friendship with her that lasted for the remainder of Highsmith's life, said that Therese was Highsmith's \"alter ego\" and \"the voice of an author.\"\n\nThe character of Carol Aird and much of the plot of the novel was inspired by Highsmith's former lovers Kathryn Hamill Cohen and Philadelphia socialite Virginia Kent Catherwood, and her relationships with them. Virginia Catherwood lost custody of her daughter in divorce proceedings that involved tape-recorded lesbian trysts in hotel rooms. The story shared the same \"sexual behavior\" and \"intense emotion\" obsessions that Highsmith's writing became known for.\n\nHighsmith placed Therese in the world of the New York theater with friends who are \"vaguely bohemian, artists or would-be artists\" and signaled their intellectual aspirations by noting they read James Joyce and Gertrude Stein, the latter unmistakably lesbian. All are struggling to find a place for themselves in the world.\n\nThe first working title of the novel (written in her \"cahier\" No. 18) was \"The Bloomingdale Story\". Other names Highsmith later considered were \"The Argument of Tantalus\", \"Blasphemy of Laughter\", and \"Paths of Lightening\" before finally naming it \"The Price of Salt\". Highsmith said that she settled on the title from a thought about the price paid by Lot's wife when she looked back towards Sodom. It's more likely, however, that she was invoking a biblical reference from the Gospel text () that André Gide included in his novel \"The Counterfeiters\", a work about the transgressive love of adolescence that Highsmith once took to heart: If the salt have lost his flavor wherewith shall it be salted?'—that is the tragedy with which I am concerned.\"\n\nHighsmith's publisher, Harper & Bros, rejected the manuscript. Her agent warned her that she was committing career suicide by following \"Strangers on a Train\" with a blatantly lesbian novel. It was accepted by Coward-McCann and published in hardcover in 1952 with the \"Claire Morgan\" alias. She dedicated the book to \"Edna, Jordy and Jeff\"—three people whom Highsmith invented.\n\nThe 25-cent lesbian pulp edition by Bantam Books appeared in 1953, followed by a mass market edition in 1969 by Macfadden Books. \"The Price of Salt\" subsequently fell out of print.\n\nIn 1983, lesbian publishing house Naiad Press offered Highsmith $5,000 to reprint the novel under her own name, or $2,000 under the pseudonym. Highsmith accepted the latter and it was reissued in 1984. In 1990, the book was republished by Bloomsbury as \"Carol\" under Patricia Highsmith's name, with the addition of an afterword by her. Phyllis Nagy said Highsmith chose \"Carol\" because Highsmith, herself, \"was Therese and the object of her desire wasn't herself...it was someone else.\" The novel was so personal to Highsmith that \"it was difficult for her to take ownership of it as a writer for many years.\"\n\nThe marketing of the novel in successive editions reflected different strategies for making the story of a lesbian romance attractive or acceptable to the reading public. The Coward-McCann dust jacket called it \"A Modern Novel of Two Women\". The paperboard cover of the 1953 Bantam edition balanced the words \"The Novel of a Love Society Forbids\" with a reassuring quote from \"The New York Times\" that said the novel \"[handles] explosive material ... with sincerity and good taste.\" The 2004 reissue by Norton appealed to highbrow tastes with the tagline \"The novel that inspired Nabokov's \"Lolita\" \" on the cover—a claim that stemmed from a theory by Terry Castle published in a 2003 essay for \"The New Republic\". (The tagline was not included in subsequent editions.)\n\nAs a movie tie-in with the release of the 2015 motion picture adaptation of the novel, Norton published a new paperback edition as \"Carol\" with the subtitle \"Previously Titled The Price of Salt\", and the cover featuring the image of the North American theatrical film poster. The cover of the Bloomsbury tie-in edition featured the title \"Carol\" superimposed on a scene from the film with images of Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara from another scene, but did not include a reference to the original title.\n\nThe paperback version of \"The Price of Salt\" sold nearly one million copies before its new edition as \"Carol\" in 1990. The novel was received well and Highsmith received letters addressed to \"Claire Morgan\" through her publisher thanking her for writing a story that lesbian women could identify with.\n\nBecause of the new title and her acknowledged authorship, the novel received another round of reviews, thoroughly favorable, 38 years after its initial publication. Highsmith submitted to publicity interviews as well, though she resented questions about her sexuality and personal relationships. When BBC 2's \"The Late Show\" presenter Sarah Dunant asked Highsmith in 1990 if \"Carol\" constituted a \"literary coming out\", she replied looking irked: \"I'll pass that one to Mrs. Grundy\", referencing the character who embodies conventional propriety.\n\nBecause of the happy (or at least, non-tragic) ending which defied the lesbian pulp formula, and because of the unconventional characters who defied stereotypes about female homosexuals, \"The Price of Salt\" was popular among lesbians in the 1950s and continued to be with later generations. It was regarded for many years as the only lesbian novel with a happy ending.\n\nHighsmith told author Marijane Meaker that she was surprised when the book was praised by lesbian readers because of how it ended. She was pleased that it had become popular for that reason and said, \"I never thought about it when I wrote it. I just told the story.\" When Highsmith allowed her name to be attached to the 1990 republication by Bloomsbury, she wrote in the \"Afterword\" to the edition:\nThe novel's representation of its lesbian characters also departed from the period's stereotypical depiction of lesbians—both in popular literature and by the medical/psychological field (where females who did not conform to their sexual gender role were considered \"congenital inverts\")—that expected one member of a lesbian couple would be \"noticeably masculine in her affect, style, and behavior\". Highsmith depicts Therese as puzzled when her experience does not match that \"butch-femme paradigm\":\n\nShe had heard about girls falling in love, and she knew what kind of people they were and what they looked like. Neither she nor Carol looked like that. Yet the way she felt about Carol passed all the tests for love and fitted all the descriptions.\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt was made in the early 1950s to turn the novel into a movie. In the screen treatment the title was changed to \"Winter Journey\" and the character of \"Carol\" was changed to \"Carl\".\n\nA radio adaptation titled \"Carol\" was broadcast by BBC Radio 4 in December 2014 with Miranda Richardson as Carol Aird and Andrea Deck as Therese Belivet. It comprised five segments of approximately 15 minutes.\n\nA 2015 British-American film adaptation of the novel, \"Carol\", was directed by Todd Haynes from a screenplay by Phyllis Nagy. The film stars Cate Blanchett as Carol and Rooney Mara as Therese. \"Carol\" was an Official Selection of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival and won the Queer Palm award. The film received six Academy Award nominations including Best Actress in a Leading Role for Blanchett, Best Supporting Actress for Mara, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Cinematography, and Best Costume Design; and nine British Academy Film Award nominations for Best Film, Best Direction, Best Actress in a Leading Role (Blanchett), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Mara), Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and Best Makeup and Hair.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2089280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089280", "title": "Octopus's Garden", "text": "Octopus's Garden\n\n\"Octopus's Garden\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, written and sung by Ringo Starr (credited to his real name Richard Starkey), from their 1969 album \"Abbey Road\". George Harrison, who assisted Starr with the song, commented: \"Octopus's Garden' is Ringo's song. It's only the second song Ringo has ever written, mind you, and it's lovely.\" He added that the song gets very deep into the listener's consciousness \"...because it's so peaceful. I suppose Ringo is writing cosmic songs these days without even realising it.\" It was the last song released by the Beatles featuring Starr on lead vocals.\n\nThe idea for the song came about when Starr was on a boat belonging to comedian Peter Sellers in Sardinia in 1968. He ordered fish and chips for lunch, but instead of fish he got squid (it was the first time he'd eaten squid, and he said, \"It was OK. A bit rubbery. Tasted like chicken.\") The boat's captain then told Starr about how octopuses travel along the sea bed picking up stones and shiny objects with which to build gardens. Starr's songwriting was further inspired by his desire to escape mounting hostility among the Beatles; he would later admit that he had \"just wanted to be under the sea, too\". Uncredited assistance in developing the song's chord changes was provided by Harrison, who can be seen helping Starr work the song out on piano, with Lennon later joining in with drums, in the \"Let It Be\" documentary. \n\nThe song, which contains the lyrics \"Oh what joy for every girl and boy/Knowing they're happy and they're safe,\" is sometimes thought of as being a song for children, like \"Yellow Submarine\" or \"All Together Now\". It has also been performed by the Muppets several times in various episodes of their shows.\n\nThe basic instrumental track was recorded 26 April 1969, with the Beatles lineup of two electric guitars (Harrison and Lennon), bass guitar (McCartney) and drums (Starr). Starr also provided a temporary guide vocal on this date. (Take 2 of the recording, featuring this guide vocal, Starr singing the first verse three times, is track 14 on disc 2 of \"Anthology 3\".) In the absence of George Martin, the Beatles themselves were listed as producer, with Martin's apprentice Chris Thomas present in the control room to assist. Thirty-two takes were required before the Beatles were satisfied with the track.\n\nThe backing vocals by McCartney and Harrison during the guitar solo were put through compressors and limiters to create a gurgling sound. At Starr's request, Harrison added the sound of bubbles by blowing through a straw into a glass of milk.\n\n\nThe song was remixed in 2006 for the Beatles album \"Love\", which contained remixes of classic Beatles songs. The remix begins with Starr's vocals over the orchestration from \"Good Night\", then transitions into the original instrumental backing track on the line \"I'd ask my friends...\", with sound effects from \"Yellow Submarine\" added in the background. During the guitar solo, the drum track is replaced with that of \"Lovely Rita\".\n\nThe track, in its original form, is also available on the compilation \"1967-1970\".\n\nIn 2014, Starr wrote a children's book based on and named after the song. The book, which consists of the song's lyrics, is illustrated by Ben Cort. A CD is included with the book, including an introduction by Starr, a new version of the song, the lyrics spoken as prose, and an instrumental version of the song.\n\nJim Henson's Muppets made three video cover versions of the song, on \"Sesame Street\", episode 19 in 1969, \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" in March 1970, and \"The Muppet Show\" episode 312 in 1978, which was performed by Robin the Frog, Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy.\n\nReparata and the Delrons released the song as a single in 1972 on Dart records, backed with \"Your Life Is Gone\". It used vocal effects and ocean-themed sound effects to mimic the style of their 1968 UK hit, \"Captain of Your Ship\". It was re-released in 1976, with the A- and B-sides reversed, and credited to Reparata (no Delrons).\n\nNoel Gallagher of Oasis adds adapted lyrics from \"Octopus's Garden\" to the end of their song \"Whatever\" during some of his live performances. The phrase \"I'd like to be under the sea\" is in the refrain of one of Oasis' most popular b-sides, \"Take Me Away\". Also, the refrain from the chorus of \"Octopus's Garden\" can be heard about forty seconds from the end of \"The Masterplan\", also by Oasis.\n\nThe song was covered and recorded by Canadian children's musician Raffi for the 1985 album \"One Light, One Sun\".\n\nThe Punkles did a punk cover on their fourth album \"For Sale\" sung by their drummer Markey Starkey.\n\nLeah Erbe performed the cover of \"Octopus's Garden\" on the Motion Picture Soundtrack for \"IMAX: Under The Sea\" The soundtrack was released by New Line Records on 1 April 2010.\n\nIn the 2009 romantic comedy film \"(500) Days of Summer\", Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) remarks that \"Octopus's Garden\" is the greatest Beatles song ever. Tom Hanson (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) tells Summer that no one loves Ringo Starr, to which Summer replies \"That's what I love about him\".\n\nIn the 2007 comedy film \"\", Ringo Starr (Jason Schwartzman) refers to his \"song about an octopus\", which is followed by a crude remark from John Lennon (Paul Rudd).\n"}

{"id": "2089284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089284", "title": "Telecentre", "text": "Telecentre\n\nA telecentre is a public place where people can access computers, the Internet, and other digital technologies that enable them to gather information, create, learn, and communicate with others while they develop essential digital skills. Telecentres exist in almost every country, although they sometimes go by a different names including public internet access center (PIAP), village knowledge center, infocenter, Telecottage, Electronic Village Hall, community technology center (CTC), community multimedia center (CMC), multipurpose community telecentre (MCT), Common/Citizen Service Centre (CSC) and school-based telecentre. While each telecentre is different, their common focus is on the use of digital technologies to support community, economic, educational, and social development—reducing isolation, bridging the digital divide, promoting health issues, creating economic opportunities, and reaching out to youth for example.\n\nThe telecentre movement’s origins can be traced to Europe's telecottage and Electronic Village Halls (originally in Denmark) and Community Technology Centers (CTCs) in the United States, both of which emerged in the 1980s as a result of advances in computing. At a time when computers were available but not yet a common household good, public access to computers emerged as a solution. Today, although home ownership of computers is widespread in the United States and other industrialized countries, there remains a need for free public access to computing, whether it is in CTCs, telecottages or public libraries to ensure that everyone has access to technologies that have become essential.\n\nThere are also CTCs located in the state of New South Wales, Australia, that provide technology, resources, training and educational programs to communities in regional, rural and remote areas.\n\nBeyond the differences in names, public ICT access centers are diverse, varying in the clientele they serve, the services they provide, as well as their business or organizational model. Around the world, some telecentres include NGO-sponsored, local government, commercial, school-based, and university-related In the United States and other countries, public access to the Internet in libraries may also be considered within the “telecentre concept”, especially when the range of services offered is not limited to pure access but also includes training end-users. Each type has advantages and disadvantages when considering attempts to link communities with ICTs and to bridge the digital divide. Among the various types: \n\n\nIt is estimated that 40% of the world's population has less than US$ 20 per year available to spend on ICT. In Brazil, the poorest 20% of the population counts with merely US$9 per year to spend on ICT (US$ 0.75 per month). In Mexico, the poorest 20% of the society counts with an estimated US$ 35 per year (US$ 3 per month). For Latin America it is estimated that the borderline between ICT as a necessity good and ICT as a luxury good is roughly around the \"magical number\" of US$10 per person per month, or US$120 per year.\n\nIn the 1990s, international development institutions such as Canada’s International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and UNESCO, sponsored the deployment of many telecentres in developing countries. Both IDRC and UNESCO are still very involved in the telecentre movement. The former telecentre.org programme at IDRC was transferred to the telecentre.org Foundation in the Philippines in March 2010 and continues to support networks of telecentres around the world. Within the Philippines, the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) has rolled-out Tech4ED (Technology for Education, to gain Employment, train Entrepreneurs towards Economic Development). This telecenter program has implemented over 42,000 centers throughout the countryside. UNESCO continues to support the growth of community multimedia centers (CMCs), which, unlike most other telecentres, have a local community radio, television or other media component.\n\nIn light of the rapidly evolving technologies that support telecentres and in light of the increased penetration of mobile technologies (i.e., cell phones), the telecentre model needs to continuously evolve in order to remain relevant and to continue to address the changing needs of the communities they serve. As mobile communication technologies become more pervasive around the world, including in rural areas, the telecentres may no longer need to provide phone services, yet they may still be very relevant in terms of access to web-enabled e-government services, e-Learning, and basic Internet communication needs (email and web browsing).\n\nAmong the various sustainability considerations:\n\n\"Evolving models\" — since the local demand for information and communication services is evolving, the telecentre models need to evolve as well. Franchises and other approaches to linking and networking telecentres are proving to be popular.\n\n\"Evolving technologies\" — wireless connectivity technologies, beyond VSAT (known to be expensive) are being explored in many communities around the world. These technologies provide new opportunities for connecting communities through telecentres and eventually at the individual household level.\n\n\"Evolving services\" — the types of services that telecentres can and should provide is also rapidly evolving. As the fields of eGovernment, eHealth, e-Learning, eCommerce are evolving and maturing in many countries, telecentres need to take advantage of opportunities to extend the benefits to the community at large, through their public access. Some governments are pursuing the deployment of telecentres precisely as a means of ensuring that larger segments of the population are able to access government services and information through electronic channels.\n\n\"Community stakeholders\" - identifying leaders among the community who champion the concept of shared services through telecentre mode, play a crucial role as a bridge between the telecentre operator and hesitant villagers. Indeed, There is a maturing period during which community leaders have to invest constant efforts to drive changes of behaviour in the adoption of innovations.\n\n\"Community involvement\" is required however, at the initial phase of the telecentre set up, starting with the site selection and creating a sort of empathy and feeling of empowerment. Furthermore, the telecentre should be well rooted in the socio-cultural context of the community.\n\nThe telecentres of today and of the future are networked telecentres, or telecentres of the 2.0 generation. Increasingly, telecentres are not operating as independent, isolated entities but as members of a network. At times, the network takes the form of a franchise. In other circumstances, the network is much more informal.\n\nOne such regional network targeted towards Asia-Pacific is, the Asia-Pacific Telecentre Network.\n\nIn the United States, more than 1,000 community technology centers where organized under the leadership of CTCnet, a nonprofit association headquartered in Washington, D.C.. CTCs are also organized under the banner of state organizations, such as the Ohio Community Computing Network, or city programs such the City of Seattle Community Technology Program. and Austin FreeNet.\n\nFor more information on telecentre networks, visit telecentre.org.

The Confederation Bridge, which connects Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, is about long, is significantly shorter than the Newfoundland–Labrador link would be, and crosses the Abegweit Passage, a shallower and calmer body of water than the Strait of Belle Isle.\n\nIn the lead-up to the October 2003 provincial election, Progressive Conservative leader Danny Williams promised to fund a feasibility study to placate link supporters.\n\nThe feasibility study into a Newfoundland–Labrador fixed link, resulting from the 2003 election promise by newly elected premier Danny Williams, was released in 2004. It examined causeway, bridge and tunnel options and recommended that a tunnel beneath the Strait of Belle Isle, accommodating a single railway track, would be the only feasible option, given the area's harsh winter weather conditions, the strait's bathymetry (the depth and shape of the sea floor), and the geology of underlying soils.\n\nElectric-powered trains would be loaded on either side and carry cars, buses and transport trucks. The authors of the study estimated that construction, either by tunnel boring or lowering pre-constructed tunnel sections to a trench in the sea floor, is beyond the current technological limit due to the depth of the sea floor and scouring of the strait by icebergs.\n\nThe authors also stated that the cost of construction and low traffic levels would not justify the cost. Conceivably, if built with federal aid, the 1949 terms of union might be amended to remove federal subsidies from the federally operated Marine Atlantic ferry service that connects Port-aux-Basques with North Sydney, Nova Scotia, and place them instead on the proposed fixed link.\n\nIn terms of driving distance, a fixed link would not be favourable for residents of the Maritimes or parts of the Eastern Seaboard of the United States as they would have to drive to Quebec City where bridges cross the St. Lawrence River (there are ferries further downstream), before continuing east along Quebec's Côte-Nord (of the Gulf of St. Lawrence).\n\nThe south coast of Labrador was isolated from the rest of the North American road network until completion of the Trans-Labrador Highway in 2009, and upgrades to its counterpart Route 389. The eventual completion of Route 138 will provide a more direct link between Labrador and the North American road network.\n\nBusiness and community leaders in Newfoundland and Labrador and the rest of Canada have also spoken out against the project, noting that the economic argument for such a link is not proven. \"The Economist\" derided the proposal in a story titled \"Now let's dig an expensive hole\".\n\nIn 2016, Premier Dwight Ball launched a new pre-feasibility study to determine the costs of a tunnel link between the island and Labrador. The study released its results in April 2018, and concluded that a undersea rail tunnel connecting L'Anse Amour in southern Labrador and Yankee Point near Flower's Cove on the Northern Peninsula of Newfoundland could be constructed at a cost of C$1.65 billion. Such a tunnel would take about 15 years to construct, with public-private partnerships strongly recommended for the financing of such a project. In a news conference covering the pre-feasibility study, Ball stated that a fixed link tunnel between Newfoundland and Labrador had the potential to be a \"nation-building project\" that could \"truly change the landscape and unify our country\". A formal feasibility study, costing up to C$22 million to conduct, is the next step in the process of formulating a plan to construct the fixed link, though there is no timeline on when to commence this study as of yet.\n\n"}

His criminal trial, known as the Buried Bodies Case, became an important case in legal ethics after his attorneys refused to disclose the location of the bodies of two of his victims, citing attorney-client privilege.\n\nRobert Garrow Jr. was born in Dannemora, New York, to French-Canadian parents Robert Omer Garrow and his wife, Margaret, who were poor farmers. Garrow later claimed his parents were severe, violent disciplinarians who regularly physically abused their children with whatever was handy, even bricks. His accounts have been repeated by his siblings.\n\nThe police were called several times throughout the years to break up violent fights between Garrow and his alcoholic father. After a particularly brutal episode when Garrow was 15, he was sent to a farm to work. He later reported a long history of sexual dysfunction and paraphilias, committed several acts of bestiality with the farm animals he worked with throughout childhood and adolescence, and would often masturbate with milking machines. Garrow joined the U.S. Air Force upon his release, but was court-martialed a year later for stealing money from a superior officer and spent six months in a military prison in Florida.\n\nGarrow returned to New York in 1957, where he married and fathered a son. His life did not improve, however; he was fired from a series of menial jobs, including from a fast food restaurant he burglarized, and was involved in an abusive relationship with a man he later described as a sadist. Garrow was arrested for rape in 1961 and spent seven years in prison. Soon after he was released, he committed a series of rapes, and many of his victims were children. He was arrested for the rape of two prepubescent girls, but jumped bail and became a fugitive.\n\nIn July 1973, Garrow murdered four people, including a young woman whom he kidnapped and repeatedly raped before killing, and a high school-aged camper in the Adirondacks a few days later. Three witnesses escaped and sought police, spurring a twelve-day statewide manhunt that was, at the time, the largest in New York State history. Road blocks were set up at intersections throughout Adirondack Park requiring motorists to open vehicle trunks for law enforcement to thoroughly search. Motorists were warned not to stop for anyone on foot near the roads for fear that Garrow might have tried to pose as a hitchhiker. He was cornered in the woods sixty miles north of the murder scene, and was shot in the foot, arm, and back by Conservation Officer Hillary LeBlanc. He survived, alleging that he was partially paralyzed.\n\nGarrow was treated at CVPH Medical Center in Plattsburgh, New York, where doctors disbelieved his claims of paralysis. He sued the State of New York for $10 million, alleging that the state's doctors had been negligent in treating the gunshot wound, leading to his alleged paralysis. He was moved to a medium security prison in exchange for dropping the lawsuit, and was later found to be feigning his paralysis. Garrow pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, but the jury rejected his plea and found him guilty of second-degree murder, sentencing him to a term of 25 years to life in prison. Garrow began his sentence at Clinton Correctional Facility (maximum security) in Dannemora on July 2, 1974. Due to his alleged paralysis, however, he repeatedly requested transfer to the Elderly and Handicapped Unit (minimum security) within the medium-security Fishkill Correctional Facility. In September, 1977, a death threat against Garrow prompted his transfer to Auburn Correctional Facility (maximum security). It was not until early 1978 that he was transferred back to Fishkill.\n\nA grand jury indicted one of Garrow's lawyers – Francis Belge, with whom he had shared the location of two victims' bodies – for violating §§ 4200(1) and 4143 of the New York Public Health Law: the first such section required that a decent burial be accorded the dead, while the second required \"anyone knowing of the death of a person without medical attendance, to report the same to proper authorities. The trial court granted the attorneys' motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the communications between Garrow and Belge as to the whereabouts of the bodies were protected by the attorney-client privilege, and \"in the interests of justice.\" As to the privilege, the court held that Belge's professional duties prohibited him from revealing information that would incriminate his client, reasoning that the Fifth Amendment rights of criminal defendants against self-incrimination would be circumvented if \"compulsory disclosure can be exacted through his attorney.\" However, the court noted that if Belge had been charged with obstruction of justice \"under a proper statute,\" rather than a rarely applied \"pseudo-criminal statute,\" the requisite balancing of the accused's Fifth Amendment rights against the rights of society to punish culpable behavior would have rendered the court's decision much more difficult.\n\nLanding himself in a less secure facility due to his false claims of paralysis, Garrow escaped from Fishkill on September 8, 1978. He was in possession of a .32 caliber pistol he had obtained from his son, who concealed the weapon inside a bucket of chicken he brought to his father during a visit. Garrow then spurred another search after he was discovered missing from his cell. The false claims about his paralysis kept the guards unsuspecting, as he scaled a fifteen-foot fence to escape the prison grounds. He waited in a nearby wooded area, remaining concealed in the brush and leaves until the search widened and he could continue running. However, Garrow was spotted by guards a few days later, a few hundred yards away from the prison walls. Garrow shot at his pursuers, wounding Correction Officer Dominic Arena in the leg, but was shot three times and killed by Correction Officer Frank Lago.\n"}
{"id": "2089343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089343", "title": "EcoQuest", "text": "EcoQuest\n\nEcoQuest is a series of two educational adventure games developed by Sierra On-Line. The original concept was developed by Sierra VP of Creative Development, Bill Davis. The authors of the series game design are Jane Jensen and Gano Haine, but Jensen was not involved in creating the second game, having moved on to the \"Gabriel Knight\" series. The game was going to be ported to Amiga and Macintosh, but those releases never came out.\n\nThe last of Sierra's various \"Quest\" series, \"EcoQuest\" is designed to teach about the importance of environmental ethics. The games are considerably easier than most Sierra adventures and cannot be lost or rendered unwinnable. Both use a fully mouse-driven version of SCI1, in the manner of \"Space Quest IV\" and \"King's Quest VI\".\n\nThe protagonist is a 10-year-old boy named Adam Greene, the son of an ecologist and an expert scuba diver.\n\nThe first installment, titled The Search for Cetus, was released first on floppy disk, then on CD-ROM with full speech in 1992. Adam's attempts to help a dolphin named Delphineus that his father has rescued, takes a turn for the weirder when the dolphin starts talking. In no time flat, he's trying to seek out Cetus, the sperm whale king of Eluria, an underwater kingdom populated by marine animals. He has assistance in the form of several creatures found in the various ecosystems of the world. Aside from the considerable liberty of sentient talking and semi-anthropomorphic animals, the game is more realistic than cartoony – it needs to be, to tell about the real world's environment and pollution.\n\nThe game presents the player with practical, narrative problems to solve (typical of Sierra adventure games of the period) combined with occasional puzzle elements similar to those found in the \"Castle of Dr Brain\". \"The Search for Cetus\" introduced the recycling symbol to Sierra's standard palette of command icons, giving the player bonus points for removing litter from the marine environment. The game introduces children ages 12 and up to marine biology and marine conservation by confronting them with the consequences of various human activities including: dumping of litter, releasing of helium-filled balloons, abandonment of fishing gear, collisions between vessels and marine mammals, spilling of oil and chemicals into the sea and the fertilization of algal blooms.\n\nIn Lost Secret of the Rainforest (aka EcoQuest II, though this does not appear in the game's title), the second installment in the series, Adam, now slightly older and able to speak with animals as a matter of course, explores the tropical rainforest in search of a cure of a disease afflicting the local Indigenous peoples of South America, and a way to save the rainforest from destruction. One of the game's innovations was the \"Ecorder\" display: a tricorder-like device Adam uses to learn about things he finds during his journey. According to \"Pelit\", the game is somewhat harder than its predecessor and places more emphasis on the dangers of selfishness and greed, as opposed to the blight of man.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2089354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089354", "title": "Atlantic Coast Hockey League", "text": "Atlantic Coast Hockey League\n\nThe Atlantic Coast Hockey League (ACHL) was a minor league hockey organization that operated between 1981 and 1987. The league was founded by Bill Coffey. The Bob Payne Trophy was awarded to the team who won the league playoff championship.\n\nAccording to a 1985 \"Montreal Gazette\" article, rookies were paid \"$150 a week plus $35 for a victory\" and veterans were paid \"as much as $300 a week.\" League regulations also said that half the roster (eight out of fifteen players) must be rookie Americans.\n\nThe ACHL's roots can be traced back to the former Eastern Hockey League (EHL) of the late 1970s and early 1980s. With a meeting of several EHL owners, the league decided to fold on July 19, 1981 and reorganize as the Atlantic Coast Hockey League. Teams and cities that were previous members of the Eastern Hockey League were interested in rejoining the league. Because the Mohawk Valley team being the most northern, the league was interested in inviting a sixth team to bridge the gap. Johnstown previously had an EHL team affiliated with the Red Wings and were the intended sixth team but due to the owner being ill, they were removed from the list. Richmond expressed interest, but due to questions about the financial stability of the league, they also dropped out. The Boston Bruins, along with several investors, were approached about putting a team in nearby Cape Cod. After an investor dropped out, Cape Cod Coliseum and WWF owner Vince McMahon purchased the rights to the franchise for $15,000.\n\nThe ACHL opened with seven teams:\n\nFrom the opening night of the season, McMahon was not happy with how the league was run. Schenectady and Fitchburg were owned by the same person. Fitchburg was placed under a league suspension and would fold after 6 games. Schenectady would fold after 9 games. In January 1982, McMahon tried to borrow $15,000 from the league, citing \"slow cash flow\". When the league denied his loan, McMahon folded his franchise. With the league now down to 4 teams, the league decided to end the season early and set the playoffs by geographical area to save on expenses. Coincidentally, the matchups did end up having the first and fourth place teams meet, along with the second vs third place teams. The Salem Raiders defeated the Winston-Salem Thunderbirds, and the Mohawk Valley Stars defeated the Baltimore Skipjacks. The Raiders and Stars played in the league final, with the Mohawk Valley Stars defeating the Raiders for the Bob Payne Trophy.\n\nOn July 24, 1987, Commissioner Ray Miron announced that the league would be suspending operations for the 1987–88 season. The Troy Slapshots had folded earlier in the previous season, and the Mohawk Valley Comets in Utica, NY had been replaced with an American Hockey League team. This left the league with only three teams—Erie, Virginia, and Carolina—not enough for it to make sense to operate. Erie would cease operations, but the Lancers and Thunderbirds would transfer to the All-American Hockey League.\n\nTwo teams from the current ECHL have roots tracing back to the Atlantic Coast Hockey League\n\nWheeling Nailers:\n\nUtah Grizzlies:\n\n\nIn December 1985, Recreational Ice of North Carolina (RINC) was granted an ACHL franchise. RINC general manager Bob Ohrablo had planned to put the franchise in Asheville, North Carolina. The team was to play in a newly built arena, the 3200-seat Asheville Ice Garden. The arena was to be completed in October 1986 and the team was supposed to start play during the 1986–87 season.\n\nA name the team contest was to be held in February 1986, with the winner to be announced in March. It is unknown if a winner was ever announced.\n\nThe Bob Payne Trophy was awarded to the playoff champion at the end of each season. The trophy is named after Bob Payne, an executive with several teams in the Southern Hockey League and Eastern Hockey League. The trophy was loaned to the winning team for one year and was returned at the start of the following year's playoffs. The Carolina Thunderbirds were the only multiple winners of the trophy, having won it three of the six years, including back-to-back wins in 1984–85 and 1985–86.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Based in Mobile, Alabama, the chain of stores operated from 1879 until 1998 when it was taken over by Dillard's.\n\nC.J. Gayfer migrated to Mobile, Alabama, from Southwold, England, sometime after the Civil War. He opened a retail department store, Gayfer's, in downtown Mobile in 1879. At the time of his death in 1915, Gayfer's employed 150 people and averaged over $500,000 in annual sales. Gayfer became well known for his philanthropy and was one of the earliest proponents of employee health care benefits.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the Mercantile Stores chain acquired Gayfer's, which then worked aggressively on the expansion of the chain. The first branch store was opened at Town & Country Plaza in Pensacola, Florida, in 1956. This successful move was followed four years later with the opening of the Springdale Plaza store in Mobile, Alabama, becoming the company's flagship store. The Downtown Mobile store closed in 1985.\n\nGayfer's expanded into the Western Gulf Coast in 1963, opening a store at Edgewater Plaza Shopping City (later Edgewater Mall) in Biloxi, Mississippi. This store was expanded in 1974 and again in 1987; it was severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (by this time it was Dillard's) and had to be rebuilt. In 1969 a store was opened in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.\n\nIn 1970, the apostrophe in the company name was dropped. This was clearly a banner year for the company, as it opened stores in Montgomery, Alabama (through the purchase of Montgomery-based Montgomery Fair); Jackson Mall in Jackson, Mississippi, and started construction of a second store in Pensacola, Florida, at Cordova Mall.\n\nFor the next twenty years, new stores would be opened or remodeled, and by 1981 there were 18 stores bearing the Gayfers name. In 1989, the Gayfers flagship store anchoring Springdale Plaza and Mall in Mobile expanded to , thus becoming one the largest department store chains in the Southern United States as well as the largest stretching from Miami to Atlanta to Houston.\n\nIn 1998, Mercantile Stores was purchased by Dillard's, Inc., and the stores that were not closed or sold to other retailers were converted to Dillard's, which ceased expanding through acquisitions after this happened.\n\nAcross the South, each store had a prominent teen board from the 1960s onward called \"The Gayfer Girls,\" which advised the store on the latest in teen fashions and produced local fashion shows.\nRosa Parks also worked at the Montgomery store when it was still called Montgomery Fair during the Civil Rights Movement.\n"}
{"id": "2089366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089366", "title": "Evangeline Booth", "text": "Evangeline Booth\n\nGeneral Evangeline Cory Booth, OF (December 25, 1865 – July 17, 1950) was a British theologian and the 4th General of The Salvation Army from 1934 to 1939. She was the first woman to hold the post.\n\nShe was born in South Hackney, London, England, the seventh of eight children born to William Booth and Catherine Mumford, who had earlier in the year founded The Christian Mission, which became The Salvation Army in 1878. Catherine Booth had recently read \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" and wanted to name her baby 'Evangeline', but William Booth did not like the name and wrote 'Evelyne' on the birth certificate. Years later, while in the United States, Evelyne would be persuaded by Frances Willard, founder of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, to adopt the name 'Evangeline' as being more dignified and more befitting the commander of The Salvation Army in America.\n\nAt 15 she was a Sergeant selling the Army's paper \"The War Cry\" in the slums of east London. In 1887, at 21 years of age, she became the officer of the corps in Marylebone, where there was very strong opposition to The Salvation Army. Wherever trouble threatened, General Booth’s solution was invariably the same, 'Send Eva!'.\n\nShe was appointed as Field Commissioner throughout Great Britain from 1888 to 1891, courageously facing riotous crowds. From 1891 until 1896 she was in charge of Officer Training. When in 1896 an American break-away group led by her brother Ballington Booth and his wife Maud Ballington Booth attempted to tempt American Salvationists away from The Salvation Army and into a rival group called Volunteers of America, General Booth sent Evangeline to New York. When she arrived the doors to Army headquarters on 14th Street had been locked against her. However, \"she mounted the fire escape and climbed through a rear window. The dissidents hissed and booed until she literally wrapped herself in an available American flag and challenged: \"Hiss that, if you dare.\" In the stunned silence she played her concertina and sang \"Over Jordan without Fearing.\" Ballington's rebellion was quelled.\"\n\nShe was appointed temporary Territorial Commander of the United States, then Territorial Commander of Canada. In 1904 she returned as Commander of the United States, and held this position until 1934. In the aftermath of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, she led a mass meeting in Union Square, New York, and raised over $12,000 for Salvation Army relief work among the victims of the disaster. During this period she became a US citizen.\n\nIn August 1917, despite the differences between Commander Evangeline Booth and US General Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF), the first of 250 Salvationists left New York for the front line of the Great War in France. They soon won the confidence of the troops with their cheerful brand of ‘seven-days-a-week’ Christianity. As tributes poured in, Evangeline protested: ‘The Salvation Army has had no new success; we have only done an old thing in an old way.’ The American people disagreed, and subscribed an unprecedented $13 million to clear debts incurred by The Army, through its provision of canteens, hostels, rest rooms during the war, and afterwards on the provision of care and accommodation for the returning forces. For her work in support of the AEF, Booth was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal by the U.S. Army. Booth was one of only a very few civilian women to be so honored for service during the First World War.\n\nIn 1927, Evangeline visited her brother, General Bramwell Booth, with a memorandum which set to change the way in which The Salvation Army appointed its General. Bramwell was not convinced; he was adamant that he would appoint his successor as his father had done before him.\n\nIn January 1929, the first High Council of The Salvation Army decided otherwise, and since then the General has been elected by the High Council, in line with Evangeline Booth’s original proposal.\n\nEvangeline Booth was elected General by the second High Council in 1934. She brought to the Generalship a wealth of experience in many areas of The Army’s work but never lost the zeal and enthusiasm of the early years. Dubbed ‘The Musician General’ by Army papers of the time, she took great interest in the soul-winning activities of the musical sections of The Salvation Army.\n\nLike her father, the Founder, Evangeline extensively travelled the world. After her election as General she toured Great Britain, and in 1935 India, Ceylon, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii and the United States; then, immediately upon her return, Norway and Sweden. By the end of 1935 she undertook a ‘motorcade’ - the entire East Coast of England up to Darlington, then several Western Counties and the Thames Valley. The following year she went on another motorcade from Land's End to John O’Groats, and visited Canada, the United States and France, though by this time she was over seventy years old.\n\nThe Salvation Army’s work greatly prospered during Evangeline Booth’s leadership, with Salvation Army activities being commenced in Singapore, Algeria, Egypt, French Equatorial Africa, the Philippines, Mexico, and Penang (Malaya).\n\nHer term of office ended on October 31, 1939 when Commissioner George Lyndon Carpenter was elected as the Army’s fifth General. Towards the end of November, Evangeline left Britain for her home in up-state New York, and spent the remaining years of her life there.\n\nShe wrote several books, including \"Toward a Better World\" and \"Songs of the Evangel\". The Salvation Army Evangeline Booth College in Atlanta, Georgia is named after her, as is 'The Evangeline Booth Lodge' in Chicago which is \"a haven for families and individuals suddenly homeless because of eviction, disasters such as a fire or flood, loss of utilities, domestic violence, being stranded while traveling, or other crises.\"\n\nGeneral Evangeline Booth lived in Hartsdale, New York, until her death at the age of 84 from arteriosclerosis. She is interred in Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, Mount Pleasant, New York near White Plains, New York. Her home, the Evangeline Booth House, now known as St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.\n\n"}

The previous inclusion of these additional genera in a family Clostridiaceae is based for the most part because the type species of these genera are in many cases phylogenetically related to misclassified species of the genus \"Clostridium\".\nHowever, with the exception of \"Anaerobacter\", \"Caloramator\", \"Oxobacter\", \"Sarcina\", and \"Thermobrachium\", these genera fall outside the radiation of what can be considered the true family Clostridiaceae and are now regarded as belonging to other families within the low G + C, Gram-positive phylum.\n\nThis misclassification is the result of well-known problems of the current taxonomic structure of the \ntraditional genus \"Clostridium\". The phylogenetic analysis of Collins (1994) was the first large-scale comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences of species of the genus \"Clostridium\" and related taxa. The fact that the species of the genus \"Clostridium\" did not form a monophyletic group has been shown in a number of studies in which small groups of \"Clostridium\" species had been compared as far back as 1981. The comparative study of Collins (1994) and subsequent studies can be used to conclude that more than half of the species currently assigned to this genus are in fact not closely related to the type species, \"C. butyricum\", and from a phylogenetic standpoint should not be included in a newly defined genus \"Clostridium\".\n\nThis extensive genetic diversity of the genus \"Clostridium\" had been shown using 23S rRNA:DNA hybridization studies back in 1975 by Johnson and Francis, but the 16S rRNA gene sequence approach revealed the actual phylogenetic relationships between the species of this genus and other genera.\n\nThe genus \"Clostridium\" currently comprises 152 validly described species in nomenclature. However, on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses, only 73 of these fall within the radiation of the type species of the genus \"Clostridium\".\n"}

Wilson continues the Illuminati-based synchronicities that have taken place since \"Cosmic Trigger I\" was first published. The book is an exploration into the future of cyberspace; the peculiarities of Irish jurisprudence; links to the Mafia, the CIA and the Catholic Church; anal-eroticism in the White House; the Dog Castrator of Palm Springs and more. The book combines humour, twists in logic and zen-like koans to get its messages across.\n\nThe book is made up of ninety-four short chapters, with the main themes interwoven throughout in a non-linear fashion. In part, this volume of the series outlines Wilson’s intellectual development, from his religious education under the (‘sadistic’) nuns at Catholic school, through to his materialist-atheistic standpoint as an engineering student, and his eventual development of the ‘model agnosticism’ which shapes much of his published work. Along the way he discusses becoming a Trotskyist when he was seventeen, and his time as an Objectivist, while under the influence of the work of Ayn Rand.\n\nOther recurring themes relate to conspiracies, involving the Vatican and allegedly freemasonic societies such as P2. He discusses the controversial death of Roberto Calvi; who was known in some quarters of the press as ‘God’s Banker,’ because of his ties to the Vatican Bank. Elsewhere, a plethora of other topics are touched upon, including Aleister Crowleyean magick ritual, Wilson’s love of movies, virtual reality, Jungian Synchronicity, and the exponential growth of global information.\n\nWilson wrote the book while the first Gulf war was in progress, and the dedication at the beginning of the book announces that the work is against the ‘makers of war’. Accordingly, many of the chapters feature anti-war quotes beneath the chapter titles, from figures ranging from William Tecumseh Sherman to Peter Ustinov, as well as more general quotes relating to concepts such as government and the social construction of reality, from people such as Oscar Wilde and H.L. Mencken.\n\nWilson later published the final part of the \"Cosmic Trigger\" trilogy, \"\", in 1995.\n\n\n"}

Instead, an interim government would be appointed, holding office from 1 January until the result of the election was known.\n\nThe first Governor-General of Australia was John Hope, 7th Earl of Hopetoun (who later became the 1st Marquess of Linlithgow). His initial task on arriving in Australia on 15 December 1900 was to appoint a Prime Minister to lead the interim government. Hopetoun had little knowledge of the Australian political scene and had no formal instructions from the Colonial Office. On 19 December, following the precedent of the Canadian Confederation, Hopetoun commissioned the Premier of the most populous colony to form a government. That state was New South Wales, and its premier was Sir William Lyne.\n\nThis was a controversial choice as Lyne had become premier in September 1899 only after the government of the more popular and experienced George Reid had lost its majority in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. Lyne supported federation only at the last minute after long being a strong opponent and, as a result, he was unpopular with other leading colonial, pro-federation politicians including Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin. \"The Bulletin\" summed up many people's view when it editorialised, \"Among the men who can claim by merit or accident, to be front-rank politicians of Australia, Lyne stands out conspicuously as almost the dullest and most ordinary\". However, there were those who supported the choice of Lyne, as Barton was at that time not a member of a parliament.\n\nDespite significant efforts, Lyne was unable to persuade any other colonial politicians to join his government. In particular, Barton wrote to him, \"If your object is to ask me to join you in a federal administration, it will be of little use for us to meet and discuss the matter. It would be a contradiction of my whole career in relation to federation if I served under a prime minister who had throughout opposed the adoption by the people of the measure of which he is now asked to the first constitutional guardian\". Lyne returned his commission to Lord Hopetoun at 10 pm on 24 December. Alfred Deakin, among others, had now persuaded Hopetoun to commission Barton as Prime Minister if Lyne was not able to form a ministry. At 11 pm that evening, Barton was given Hopetoun's commission, and he was successful in forming a government, which took office on 1 January 1901. He appointed Lyne as his Minister for Home Affairs in what many saw as a gesture of reconciliation.\n\nHopetoun's move of calling on Lyne to form a government became known as the \"Hopetoun Blunder\" and marked the beginning of what many historians consider to be his unsuccessful term as Governor-General.\n\n"}

It is a member of TU9, an incorporated society of the largest and most notable German institutes of technology. The university is especially known for its reputation in the fields of advanced automotive engineering, efficient industrial and automated manufacturing, process engineering, aerospace engineering and activity-based costing.\n\nFrom 1770 to 1794, the Karlsschule was the first university in Stuttgart. Located in Stuttgart-Hohenheim, it has since 1818 been the University of Hohenheim and is not related to the University of Stuttgart, except for some joint activities.\n\nWhat is now the University of Stuttgart was founded in 1829, and celebrated its 175th anniversary in 2004. Because of the increasing importance of the technical sciences and instruction in these fields, from 1876 the university was known as the Technische Hochschule Stuttgart (Stuttgart Institute of Technology). In 1900 it was awarded the right to grant doctoral degrees in the technical disciplines. The development of the courses of study at the Technische Hochschule Stuttgart led to its renaming in 1967 to the present-day \"Universität Stuttgart\". With this change of name came along a built-up of new fields, such as history of science and technology and the social sciences, and the extension of existing ones, such as history and art history.\n\nSince the end of the 1950s, a part of the university has been located in the suburb of Stuttgart-Vaihingen.

Nosy Be is Madagascar's largest and busiest tourist resort. It has an area of , and its population was officially estimated at 73,010 in 2013.\n\n\"Nosy Be\" means \"big island\" in the Malagasy language. The island was called Assada during the early colonial era of the 17th century. Nosy Be has been given several nicknames over the centuries, including \"Nosy Manitra\" (the scented island).\n\nThe first human inhabitants of Nosy Be were small bands of Antankarana and Zafinofotsy, before the Sakalava migrated there and became the most numerous ethnic group on the island. These people were joined later by some Comorians, Indians or Antandroy.\n\nNosy Be made first major appearance in Madagascar's history when King Radama I announced that he intended to conquer the whole west of the red island up to the sea. That plan was eventually achieved when the Sakalava Kingdom of Boina came into his possession in 1837 when Queen Tsiomeko's army was defeated. The French colonized the island from 1840, founding an outpost named Hell-Ville (from French Admiral de Hell). In 1849, slavery was abolished by the French, though the slaves were owned by Malagasies. It caused a Malagasy revolt against the French. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the island was governed by the French as an internal protectorate within the colony of Madagascar. The French used both military force and diplomacy to maintain their position in the island, appointing the former ruler of Nosy Be Binao as the \"gouverneur principal\" of the island. Though it was difficult for the French to control the littoral, they founded a plantation colony in Nosy Be, mainly producing sugar and cash crops. \nDuring the Russo-Japanese War Nosy Be became a supply station for Russia's Second Pacific Squadron. The main fleet led by Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky reached Nosy Be on January 9, 1905, where it met a smaller detachment led by Admiral Dmitry von Fölkersam that had arrived already on December 28, 1904. The fleet stayed for two months for refurbishing and coaling, leaving on March 17 to meet its fate ten weeks later at the Battle of Tsushima.\n\nThe island, like most of Madagascar, suffers from an extreme level of uncertainty linked to crime and violence. Rumours quickly turn into accusations in Madagascar, and lynchings are common, even for allegations related to traffic accidents or theft. On October 3, 2013, the body of an 8-year-old boy was discovered at the beach of Ambatoloaka on the island. The condition of the body was poor after one week in the water, and a rumour was spread that the child had been murdered by Western organ-trafficking tourists. The uncle of the boy, a local named Zaidou, was detained by the local police for questioning, but a violent mob gathered to storm the local jail to punish the supposed murderer. \n\nAs the uncle was not found, the anger of the mob turned to the Westerners having been in contact with the person, French tourists Sébastien Judalet and Roberto Gianfalla. Judalet was found and dragged from his hotel to the beach of Ambatoloaka, where the large mob repeatedly hit him with sticks and stones. The police received at least five calls from bystanders or expatriates but did not respond. Two police officers actually joined the mob, one of which who was filming the lynching on his smartphone. After three hours of torture and humiliation, the naked and bleeding tourists were put into car tires and thrown alive into a bonfire on the beach. On the afternoon of October 3, 2013, the uncle Zaidou was found driving on the island. A mob of several hundred quickly lynched him by burning him alive on a public street next to a mosque. \n\nBoth events were filmed by the bystanders, publishing the murders on the internet. In spite of this mass of evidence, the local justice took two years of investigation to finally convict 4 members of the mob to lifetime imprisonment and 6 others to shorter sentences; 26 suspects in custody were released without charge as well as the two police officers. A local politician, Joseph Yoland, was accused of inciting the killings on his radio station at the island, but the charges were dropped when the court allegedly was unable to retrieve any recordings of the aired shows that evening. Following the events, the French authorities warned travellers for \"high risk of assaults, that could be extremely violent\", U.S. travellers are also advised \"[to] be aware of the potential for mob violence and ‘popular justice’ that is sometimes directed towards foreign nationals.\". The lynching in Nosy Be is a rare public murder of expatriates in Madagascar; most lynchings concern locals. However, expatriates are frequently subject to kidnapping and extortion, such as the January 2015 kidnapping of a 12-year old French child outside of his school, and two separate kidnappings of French citizens of Indo-Pakistani origin in April 2016 that triggered the intervention of the French police tactical unit GIGN in Madagascar.\n\nNosy Be is located about eight kilometers () from the coast of Madagascar in the Mozambique Channel; several smaller islands are located nearby, including Nosy Komba, Nosy Mitsio, Nosy Sakatia, and Nosy Tanikely. The island's main town is Andoany.\n\nThe volcanic island has an area of about , and its highest peak is Mont Lokobe at ; the volcano is of Holocene origin but has not erupted in recorded history. There are eleven volcanic crater lakes on the island.\n\nThe island is known for having one of the world's smallest frogs (\"Stumpffia pygmaea\") and chameleon (\"Brookesia minima\"). The Lokobe Reserve is one of Madagascar's five Strict Nature Reserves (\"Réserves Naturelles Intégrales\"). Nosy Be is also home to a specific color of panther chameleon (\"Furcifer pardalis\").\n\nRecent studies indicate that adjacent waters around the channel between Nosy Be and Madagascar host a habitat for notable number of Omura's whale, and this has allowed researchers to conduct field studies targeting this rare species for the first time.\n\nNosy Be has a tropical monsoon climate. It is most humid in summer (December, January, February). The Tsaratanana massif partially protects the island from the strong north-east winds affecting the region in August or during tropical depressions. The wet season lasts from October until the beginning of May, followed by a relatively short dry season that lasts through September. As characteristic of its climate however, it still sees moderate amounts of precipitation even during this time. Daytime temperatures remain fairly steady throughout the year, hovering around 30°C (86 °F), while the nights are slightly cooler during the dry season.\n\nThe island constitutes a department within Diana Region and is organized as the City of Nosy Be (Commune Urbaine de Nosy Be). Its mayor is Mr. Ali Aboudou.\n\nOnce a major location of plantation of sugar cane and production of its derived products (sugar, rum), the island's main activities are now the plantation of ylang-ylang (for the production of essential oils) and tourism. Nosy Be is the most developed tourism destination in Madagascar. This is the only place in Madagascar where all-inclusive large resorts can be found.\n\nThe island is served by Fascene Airport. The airport is serviced by commercial flights with Air Madagascar, Air Austral, Ewa, Ethiopian Airlines, and has direct flights from Europe on Neos. Its main city and harbour, Hell-Ville, can be reached by boat from Ankify.\n\nFrench international schools:\n\nNosy Be is twinned with:\n\n\n"}

For about six months the new policy was remarkably effective: Osborne sales boomed and competitors were unable to match their prices. Osborne were selling well below cost, but their retail losses were made up for by currency fluctuations, in particular the steadily rising value of the Australian dollar against the United States dollar.\n\nInevitably, the currency movement swung back the other way eventually, and Osborne were placed on credit hold by several of their major suppliers: unable to secure more components until at least some of the previous shipments had been paid for, and unable to ship the promised new computers to the many customers who had long since paid in full for them, Osborne went into Voluntary Administration on 25 June 1995.

Passed in 1996 under Prime Minister Jean Chrétien's government, it repeals the \"Narcotic Control Act\" and Parts III and IV of the \"Food and Drugs Act\", and establishes eight Schedules of controlled substances and two Classes of precursors. It provides that \"The Governor in Council may, by order, amend any of Schedules I to VIII by adding to them or deleting from them any item or portion of an item, where the Governor in Council deems the amendment to be necessary in the public interest.\"\n\nThe \"Act\" serves as the implementing legislation for the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.\n\nIn November 2007, the Justice Minister Rob Nicholson introduced Bill C-26, which proposed a number of mandatory minimum penalties imposed on those who commit drug offences. On February 27, 2009, Bill C-15, a re-introduction of C-26 received first reading in the Second Session of the 40th Zl of Canada. On June 9, 2009, the House of Commons passed Bill C-15 and it went to the Senate for study and approval. On December 14, 2009, the Senate passed Bill C-15, with some amendments, for approval by the House of Commons. When the Canadian Parliament dissolved in a prorogation on January 31, 2010, Bill C15, along with all unpassed legislation then tabled before the Commons, fell. Early in 2012, the next parliament passed Bill C-10, receiving Royal Assent in March. The final legislation sees changes made to four areas of the \"Act\", outlining mandatory minimum sentences for offences relating to the trafficking and production of various controlled substances. Mandatory minimum sentencing does not apply to simple possession and trafficking in smaller amounts. On October 17, 2018, the federal \"Cannabis Act\" came into effect, legalizing the possession, sale and production of cannabis.

{"id": "2089418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089418", "title": "Wath upon Dearne", "text": "Wath upon Dearne\n\nWath upon Dearne (often hyphenated or abbreviated to Wath ) is a town on the south side of the Dearne Valley in the historic county of the West Riding of Yorkshire and the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England, north of Rotherham and almost midway between Barnsley and Doncaster. It had a population of 11,816 at the 2011 census. It is twinned with Saint-Jean-de-Bournay, in France.\n\nWath can be traced back to Norman times, It has an entry in the 1076 Domesday Book as \"Wad\" and \"Waith\". It remained for some centuries a rural settlement astride the junction of the old Doncaster–Barnsley and Rotherham–Pontefract roads, the latter a branch of Ryknield Street. North of the town was the ford of the River Dearne. The origin of its name has been linked to the Latin \"vadum\" and the Old Norse \"vath\" (ford or wading place). The town received a Royal Charter in 1312–1313. entitling it to a weekly Tuesday market and an annual two-day fair, but these were soon discontinued. The market was revived in 1814.\n\nUntil the mid-19th century the town had a racecourse of regional importance, linked to the estate at nearby Wentworth. This fell into disuse, but traces of the track can be seen between Wath and Swinton and it is remembered in street names. There was a pottery at Newhill, close to deposits of clay, but it was overshadowed by the nearby Rockingham Pottery in Swinton. About the turn of the 19th century, the poet and newspaper editor James Montgomery, resident at that time, called it \"the Queen of villages\". This rural character changed rapidly in the 19th and 20th centuries, as coal mining developed.\n\nThe town lies within the South Yorkshire coalfield, where high-quality bituminous coal was dug from outcrops and near-surface seams in primitive bell pits for many hundreds of years. Several high-grade coal seams are close to the surface in this area, including the prolific Barnsley and Parkgate seams. The rising demand for coal arose from rapid industrialisation of the area in the 19th and early 20th century. The population swelled and the local infrastructure was developed for the coal industry, but this reliance on the one industry stored up future problems.\n\nThe Dearne and Dove Canal, opened in stages from 1798 to 1804 to access the collieries on the southern side of the Dearne Valley, passed through the town just north of the High Street on an embankment and then turned north into the valley. This wide section was known locally as the \"Bay of Biscay\". The canal closed in 1961 after many years of disuse and poor repair. Much of the canal line has since been used for roads, one of them called Biscay Way.\n\nBy the 20th century, heavy industry was evident, with many large collieries operating. Wath Main and Manvers Main were the two usually mentioned. After the Second World War, the collieries clustered around Manvers were developed into a large complex, also covering coal preparation, coal products and a coking plant, which was not only visible, but detectable in the air for miles around.\n\nRail took over from the canal as a means of coal transportation. Wath upon Dearne became a rail-freight centre of national importance. Wath marshalling yard, built north of the town in 1907, was one of the biggest, and for its time most modern railway marshalling yards in the country. It was one of the eastern ends of the trans-Pennine Manchester–Sheffield–Wath electrified railway (also known as the Woodhead Line), a project which spanned the Second World War and was in part justified by the need to transport large amounts of coal mined in the Wath area to customers in North-West England.\n\nWath once had three railway stations: Wath Central in Moor Road, Wath (Hull and Barnsley) and Wath North both in Station Road, in order of distance from the town centre. This most distant station was the last to close in 1968, under the Beeching Axe. The town no longer has a rail link, although there has been talk of opening a station on the Sheffield–Wakefield–Leeds line at Manvers, roughly a mile from the town centre.\n\nThe local coal industry was in the forefront of the dramatic decline of the British coal-mining industry, precipitated by a change in government economic policy in the early 1980s. This had severe knock-on effects on many subsidiary local industries and caused much local hardship. The 1985 miners' strike was sparked by the impending closure of Cortonwood Colliery in Brampton Bierlow, a neighbouring village often considered part of Wath. Along with the whole of the Dearne Valley, Wath was classified as an impoverished area and received much public money, including European funds. These were put into regenerating the area from the mid-1990s onwards, causing a certain amount of economic revival, and made the area to be more rural, as much land to the north of the town once used by collieries and marshalling yards was returned to scrubland and countryside, dotted with light industrial and commercial office parks. This regeneration of what was still classified as brownfield land has involved building it over with various industrial and commercial parks, and large housing developments have also been started.\n\nWath upon Dearne is centred on Montgomery Square, which contains the town's main shops, the library and the bus station. Immediately to the west is the substantial Norman All Saints Church, on a small leafy green with the Town Hall, the Montgomery Hall and a campus of the Dearne Valley College. There are several pubs in the town centre, including a branch of Wetherspoons and \"Wath Tap\", Rotherham's first micro-pub specialising in locally brewed real ale.\n\nToday Wath is still emerging from the sudden collapse of the coal industry, although jobs and some low-level affluence have returned. After a hiatus between the clearing of the former colliery land and recent redevelopment, when the area felt rather rural, the construction of large distribution centres to the north of the town is restoring an industrial feel, but without the pollution issues connected with coal. Recently several large distribution warehouses for the clothing chain Next have opened. Much new housing is being built on this reclaimed land.\n\nWath Festival, held around the early May bank holiday, is a folk and acoustic music and arts festival founded by members of the Wath Morris Dancing Team in 1972. It has grown to host some well-known names on the folk, acoustic and world music scene. While festival events occur across the town, most of the larger music concerts are held at the Montgomery Hall Theatre and Community Venue. Artists recently appearing include Dougie MacLean, Fairport Convention, Martin Simpson, John Tams, Frances Black, John McCusker, Stacey Earle and Eddi Reader.\n\nThe festival celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2012 and won Village Festival Of The Year in the 2013 FATEA Awards. The festival has been a supporter of upcoming young artists such as Lucy Ward, and Greg Russell & Ciaran Algar. It has also hosted the Wath Festival Young Performers Award, founded by the young Sheffield-based musician Charlie Barker in 2011, who handed it over to a festival committee in 2014. Winners of the Young Performers Award include Luke Hirst & Sarah Smout, Sunjay, Rose Redd and Hannah Cumming.\n\nThe event includes traditional dancing from local Morris and Sword Dancing groups, street performances, workshops, children's events, and a Saturday morning parade from Montgomery Hall through Montgomery Square and back to St James's Church, for a traditional throwing of bread buns from the parish church tower. Local schools, organisations and local Labour MP John Healey are active in celebrating the town's history and contributing to community activities at the annual festival.\n\nThe RSPB's Old Moor nature reserve lies a mile to the north-west of the town. It occupies a \"flash\", where mining-induced subsidence of land close to a river has created wetlands.\n\nWath Athletic F.C. served the community from the 1880s to the Second World War, playing in the Midland League and reaching the 1st Round of the FA Cup in 1926. No senior team has represented the settlement since the 1950s, and Wath remains one of the largest areas in Yorkshire without such a team. However, it has a Rugby Union team that plays in the Yorkshire Division 2.\n\nThere are four primary schools, all serving ages 3–11: Our Lady and St Joseph's Catholic Primary School, Wath Central Primary School, Wath C of E Primary School, and Wath Victoria Primary School. The town's two secondary schools are Saint Pius X Catholic High School (an 11–16 school) and the much larger Wath Academy, which has a sixth form and provides 11–18 education. Both take students from a wider area. Wath (Park Road) Secondary Modern School closed in 1963.\n\nA large further education college, Dearne Valley College, based in Wath, has a main campus at Manvers and a smaller one near the town centre.\n\n\n"}

Schomburg, born Alejandro Schomburg y Rosa (; May 10, 1905 – April 7, 1998), was a Puerto Rican commercial artist and comic-book artist and painter whose career lasted over 70 years in the mainland United States.\n\nAlex Schomburg was born on May 10, 1905, in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, as the son of Guillermo Schomburg, a civil engineer and land surveyor of German ancestry, and Francisca Rosa. Alex Schomburg moved to New York City in 1917, where he joined his older brothers and attended public school. In 1923 he began work as a commercial artist with three of his brothers. In 1928, the brothers' partnership ended and Schomburg found work with the National Screen Service, creating lantern slides and working on movie trailers there through 1944.\n\nDuring the 1930s, in addition to working for the NSS, Schomburg freelanced Better Publications, producing interior line art for \"Thrilling Wonder Stories\" and others of the company's pulp magazines. His skill at drawing anything mechanical soon had him illustrating aviation covers for \"Flying Aces\" and electronic equipment for the Hugo Gernsback pulp \"Radio Craft.\" Schomburg's first science fiction-themed cover was for the September 1939 issue of \"Startling Stories.\" As the artist recalled in 1939, \"One day the publisher asked me to do an illustration for \"Thrilling Wonder Stories\". I had always been interested in science fiction and they liked the way I handled the art work. I enjoy reading the story as much as doing the illustrations. In my opinion an illustration is very important. For instance, give the same story to two different persons ... then ask them to picture a certain scene. You can bet they'll be entirely different.\"\n\nThe following decade, Schomburg freelanced primarily for Timely Comics, the 1940s forerunner of Marvel, displaying his talent for action tableaux in covers featuring Captain America, the Sub-Mariner, the Human Torch, and other superheroes. His first recorded comic-book work is two covers released the same month, for \"Daring Mystery Comics\" #1 and \"Marvel Mystery Comics\" #3 (both cover-dated Jan. 1940). Schomburg would draw most of the companies covers, as well as a smattering of single-page interior illustrations, through \"Marvel Mystery Comics\" #76 (Sept. 1946). He also provided covers for Pines Publications, for titles including \"Exciting Comics\" and \"America's Best Comics\", featuring such superheroes as the Black Terror and the Fighting Yank, as well as for Harvey Comics, including the licensed radio-series crimefighter star of \"Green Hornet Comics\". On some Pines comics from 1947 to 1949, he signed covers \"Xela\".\n\nIn the early 1950s, Schomburg left comics and spent the remainder of his career on covers and illustrations for science fiction magazines, astrology publications, and books, including the Winston juvenile series.\n\nIn 1977, Schomburg and a few of his fellow Golden Age comic book artists collaborated on the \"Invaders\" Annual #1, written by Roy Thomas. Schomburg penciled and inked a six-page chapter featuring the Golden Age Human Torch.\n\nLate in life, Schomburg resided in Hillsboro, Oregon, and died in Beaverton, Oregon, on April 7, 1998.\n\nStan Lee wrote:\n\n\n"}

Wilson discusses this with his usual humor, and then uses it as a springboard into philosophical meditation on broader issues relating to the nature of ‘truth’ and existential questions about death and reality. Indeed, much of the book is concerned with the mutability of reality; the different layers or ‘masks’ of experience, in a Nietzschean sense. Wilson uses the example of Elmyr, the art forger, to explore issues such as authenticity and consensus reality. Another key figure throughout is Orson Welles. Wilson comments on the techniques Welles used in his films, relating their effects to the relativistic conceptualization of reality that Wilson associates with the use of marijuana.\n\nHe also carries on his examination of information density and its move ‘steadily westward’ which he touched upon in the second volume of the series. In this regard, and elsewhere in the book, Wilson embraces the ideas and philosophy of R. Buckminster Fuller.\n\nOther concepts explored are postmodernism and political correctness; and he use the example of militant feminism to demonstrate how dogmatic adherence to any belief system can result in intolerant and even dangerous ideologies, suggesting that dogmatic and extreme feminism has made androphobia acceptable (he uses the term 'androphobia' in reference to the fear/hatred of all men on ideological grounds, rather than in the psychological sense). Although this argument could be construed by some as sexist, it is made clear that he is in agreement with the basic aims of traditional and mainstream feminism (i.e. the equality of women and men) and he only opposes the most extreme strains of feminism, and he also states that he is in agreement with many of the goals of political correctness, yet opposes the ‘fascist’ tactics used by some of its adherents to force its ideals on people.\n\nOther topics include LSD, science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, and the potential pitfalls of blindly accepting ‘expert’ opinion; all loosely connected by the underlying theme of the perspectival and relative construction of reality.\n\n\n"}

An outspoken critic of Syrian interference in Lebanese affairs, he was killed in 2005 by a bomb placed under the passenger seat of his Mercedes. Lebanese people accused the Syrian government of assassinating him. He was the stepfather of the Lebanese Armenian politician Rafi Madayan, who also has a stepson, Charbel Khalifeh Hachem.\n\nGeorge Hawi was born in the village of Bteghrine, Lebanon on 5 November 1938 to a Lebanese family. Although born into an Antiochian Greek Orthodox Christian family, Hawi was a professed atheist.\n\nHe became active in student politics in his early years at university, participating in numerous strikes and demonstrations and in several popular movements. He joined the LCP in 1955 and became one of the main leaders of its Student League by the end of the decade.\n\nIn 1964, he was imprisoned for his involvement in a strike against Lebanon’s state-controlled tobacco manufacturer. In 1969 he was again in prison for participation in a demonstration on 23 April in support of the Palestinian cause, and again in 1970 for his part in attacking an army detachment.\n\nHawi was briefly expelled from the LCP in 1967 for calling for more independence from the policies of the Soviet Union. He rejoined the Party and was elected a member of its political bureau in the second and third congresses in 1968 and 1972. Hawi was elected as the general secretary of the Lebanese Communist Party after its fourth congress in 1979 — a position he kept until 1993 when he resigned. He was the fourth general secretary of the party following Fuad Shemali, Farajallah el-Helou and Nicolas Shawi. He was succeeded by Farouk Dahrouj.\n\nDuring the Lebanese Civil War Hawi, who used the kunya-style nom de guerre \"Abu Anis\", established the Popular Guard, the LCP militia, which was aligned with the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) of Druze leader Kamal Jumblatt in its opposition to the Maronite-dominated government and Christian-backed militias. \n\nThe LCP was also active in the guerrilla warfare against Israel and its proxy militia, the South Lebanon Army (SLA), in southern Lebanon, after the Israeli invasion in 1982. During the invasion he created the Lebanese National Resistance Front together with Muhsin Ibrahim. LNRF was commanded by Elias Atallah. At later stages of the war, the LCP under Hawi allied with Syria, which had entered Lebanon in 1976, but was to stay in the country for nearly 30 years.\n\nHe became a critic of the influence of Damascus on Lebanon late in his life, after having left the LCP in 2000. In 2004, he supported the foundation of the leftist Democratic Left Movement (DLM), that was against the Syrian presence in Lebanon and participated in the Independence Uprising of 2005. Murdered journalist Samir Kassir was a prominent member and co-founder of this group.\n\nIn June 2005, Hawi claimed in an interview with Al Jazeera, that Rifaat al-Assad, brother of Hafez al Assad and uncle of Syria's current President Bashar al-Assad, had been behind the killing of Jumblatt.\n\nGeorge Hawi was assassinated on 21 June 2005 when a bomb planted in his car was detonated by remote control, as he travelled through Beirut's Wata Musaitbi neighbourhood. A nearly one-pound charge was placed under his seat, and was detonated by remote control. His driver survived, but he was mortally wounded in the blast. Several sources including the March 14 Alliance and members of the Western media immediately blamed Syria for his killing and for the other explosions in the capital though a definitive culprit has yet to be found.\n\nIn August 2011, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon informed members of Hawi's family that they had found a link between his murder and that of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri. The STL had previously issued indictments against members of Hezbollah for the Hariri killing.\n\n"}

Cordell said that pop culture has \"less impact on [his] conceptualizations of the undead\", but he did mention \"The Evil Dead\", \"28 Days Later\" and the novel \"Salem's Lot\". According to Collins, he and Cordell worked equally on the book, with Collins focusing more on material relating to character building, sample undead and running undead, while Cordell dealt with monster design and undead material, but he said that they \"dabbled in each others'\" sections quite a bit as well\". He also mentioned a monster template designed by Matt Sernett that was originally written for the \"Monster Manual III\" and had been included in \"Libris Mortis\".\n\n\"Libris Mortis\" was named after a book from within the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" universe written by an aasimar cleric of Pelor named Acrinus in a dialect of the Celestial language of good outsiders. The title of the fictional book probably translates into English as \"From the Books of Death\", though the dialect is no longer used.\n\nThe title \"Libris Mortis\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> was intended to be interpreted as Latin, but \"Book of the Dead\" would translate as \"Liber Mortuorum\". On the subject of name, Collins was quoted as saying \"I don't have any insight on the naming process that produced \"Libris Mortis\". I don't know Latin and wasn't involved in selecting that name. Regardless, I think what's in the book is far more important that what name is attached to it.\"\n\n\"Libris Mortis\" has seven chapters and an introduction. The chapters are named \"All About Undead\", \"Character Options\", \"Prestige Classes\", \"Spells\", \"Equipment\", \"New Monsters\" and \"Campaigns\".\n\nThe first chapter, \"All About Undead\", contains general information about undead monsters. The chapter discusses the ecology of undead creatures, though this section was described as \"very small\", and talks about undead religion, introducing new deities. The chapter also discusses \"stranger areas\", including the idea of undead citizenship in cosmopolitan cities. Variant rules are introduced for areas including hauntings and exorcisms, which were received positively, and for undead hunger and appetites. The section also includes advice on how to combat undead, but according to Casey Smith of D20 Magazine Rack, \"veteran players probably won't get much out of this part of the book\". Overall, the section was described by one reviewer as \"one of the more interesting\".\n\nThe second chapter, \"Character Options\", lists 59 feats, discusses undead characters in the party, and offers rules for undead monster classes. Many of the feats are geared towards spellcasters, with few martial feats, a single Bardic feat and no feats geared specifically towards Druids or Barbarians. Different types of feats include the Corpsecrafter tree, for spellcasters to improve their undead, monstrous feats to modify the special abilities of undead creatures, and tomb-tainted feats, allowing living characters to gain undead traits. Smith commended feats that Dungeon Masters may use, such as Spell Drain, Lifesense and Necrotic Reserves, but said that \"feats that players might use aren't nearly as interesting\". The discussion of and rules for undead characters was said to be the \"weakest section of the book\". Five alternate base classes were introduced in the \"Savage Species\" \"monsters as classes\" format. These are classes for the Ghoul/Ghast, Mohrg, Mummy, Vampire Spawn and Wight.\n\nChapter three, \"Prestige Classes\", introduces eleven new prestige classes.\n\n\nThe chapter has four prestige classes specifically for undead:\n\n\nKenneth Newquist, of Nuketown, said that the undead prestige classes \"are excellent for turning traditional undead threats into something exceptional\", and said that his \"only complaint with these prestige classes is that there aren't enough of them\".\n\nChapter four, \"Spells\", introduces 57 new spells. The spells mostly focus around the school of Necromancy, with many domain spells for the new deities introduced in the first chapter. Spells commented on by reviewers included Consumptive Field, Awaken Undead, Wither Limb, Avasculate, Necrotic Cyst (and related spells, including Necrotic Domination and Necrotic Bloat), along with spells aimed at players, such as Spawn Screen and Mass Death Ward, described as \"more pragmatic than exciting\". Some of the spells included in the chapter were version 3.5 reworks of spells found in the \"Book of Vile Darkness\".\n\nChapter five, \"Equipment\", contains sections on special items and alchemical substances, \"positoxins\", magic items and undead grafts. Positoxins, poisons that affect undead, were poorly received by reviewers, with the Nuketown podcast asking \"we have plenty of folklore remedies for combating undead, why not create magical versions of those?\" Magic items included profane weapons, sacred weapons, ectoplasmic armor and specific items including the Ghoul Globe and Unholy Shroud. This section was also criticized by the Nuketown podcast, which said that the \"Magic item section is only six pages; I'd like to have seen more magic items, particularly more unique ones alone with a few lesser artifacts\". The grafts section worked on rules introduced in the \"Book of Vile Darkness\" and the \"Fiend Folio\", adding new undead \"grafts\", but did not include rules for creating your own.\n\nChapter six, \"New Monsters\", introduces 47 new monsters, the weakest of which is the Carcass Eater and the strongest of which is the Dream Vestige. Newquist praised ooze like Blood Animote, while the Nuketown podcast commended the Swarm templates. Smith praised the Brain in a Jar, swarm-shifter templates, Necropolitan, Revived Fossil and Skulking Cyst, but called the Hulking Corpse and Murk \"surprisingly benign\". Mike MacKenzie, of RPGnet, called the Skin Kite and Angel of Decay \"ghastly\", the Revived Fossil and Necropolitan \"less interesting\" and the Half Vampire an \"extraordinarily bad idea\".\n\nThe seventh and final chapter, \"Campaigns\", includes tips on how to use undead in campaigns and adventures, as well as how to control specific undead monsters. It also has adventure sites and back-stories for various cults. The chapter was well received, being called the \"best section of the book\" and being \"better than I [the reviewer] expected\". The maps were commended by some, being called \"useful right out of the box\" but Mike MacKenzie, of RPGnet, said they were \"basically a \"Book of Lairs\" for undead. Nothing terribly remarkable here.\" The section includes statistics and back-stories for alternatives classic undead monsters, including ten different ghosts, six liches, 19 skeletons, ten vampires, and fifteen zombies.\n\nThe \"Libris Mortis\" art staff comprises Dawn Murin as art director, Dee Barnett, Dawn Murin and Trich Yochum as graphic designers. The graphic production specialist was Angelika Lokotz, with Candice Baker as image technician. Cartography was provided by Dennis Kauth, with the cover designed by Tom Kidd. Interior illustrations were provided by Thomas Baxa, Steve Belledin, Jeff Easley, Steve Ellis, Wayne England, Emmanuelle Hunter, Jeremy Jarvis, Chuck Lukacs (who provided the images for the start of each chapter), David Martin, Michael Phillippi, Steve Prescott, Wayne Reynolds and Brian Snoddy. The artwork was praised by Mike MacKenzie of RPGnet, who said that \"the art is good. Its re-assuring to see the quality we expect from WotC in this department.\" He criticized the \"unintentionally goofy\" images of the Mohrg Barbarian and Wight archer, but commended the \"sepia-tinged\" work of Wayne England as fitting the book's mood. The work by Chuck Lukacs was also praised, as were the images by Jeremy Jarvis. Jarvis' Angel of Decay and Atropal Scion were said to be \"just as creepy as we would expect\".\n\n\"Libris Mortis\" was generally received positively by reviewers. Mike MacKenzie, of RPGnet, gave the book a 5/5 for style and a 4/5 for substance, with the summary comment: \"As a DM, I personally think this is a great (creepy) book, especially the first and last chapters, and there is some good crunch to be found.\" Casey Smith, of D20 Magazine Rack, gave the book 80% \"reviewer opinion\", averaging with other scores to give an overall grade of 82%. Kenneth Newquist, of Nuketown, gave \"Libris Mortis\" a rating of 9/10, with the comment \"\"Libris Mortis\" isn't an essential source book, but it is a useful one.\" The Nuketown podcast gave the book 8/10, saying it was \"good, but not essential. Worth picking up for anyone for whom the undead play a major role in their campaign.\" Vincent Venturella, of Flames Rising Dot Com, gave the book 3/5 for style, 5/5 for substance and 4/5 overall.\n\nThe reviewer from \"Pyramid\" commented: \"There's a little more campaign advice here than in previous Wizards of the Coast products, though not a whole lot. You get a short introduction to what undead are and how they unlive, eat (eww), and procreate. Theories on whence they come, examples of cities and religions for the cosmopolitan zombie, and advice on strategy when facing (or being) the dead (especially the self-aware threats) make good reading, but these are sadly brief.\"\n\n"}

Considered a residential school survivor, he attended residential schools in Fort Simpson, Providence, Inuvik, and Yellowknife, and the University of Alberta where he graduated with Bachelor of Arts and Law degrees.\n\nIn 1970, Sibbeston was elected to a four-year term on the North West Territorial Council until he was defeated by William Lafferty in the 1975 Northwest Territories general election.\n\nHe was re-elected in the 1979 Northwest Territories general election and would continue to be an MLA until 1991. During his second term in the Legislative Assembly, Sibbeston was elected to serve in the Executive Council.\n\nIn a 1981 incident, Sibbeston was thrown out of the territorial legislature for throwing a cup of coffee at Peter Fraser, the speaker of the legislature, during an intense debate.\n\nHe would serve six years in Cabinet until he was elected to serve as the fourth Premier of the Northwest Territories from 1985 until 1987.\n\nAfter 1991, Sibbeston worked briefly for the Government of Northwest Territories, as justice specialist and as a public administrator for Deh Cho Health & Social Services.

Leonard (April 24, 1910 – May 10, 1973), born Leonard Lebitsky, was an American comedian and actor who made frequent appearances on television variety and game shows.\n\nLeonard was born Leonard Lebitsky on April 24, 1910, in Chicago (“You know, the city where kids play robbers and robbers”), the son of a Jewish tailor. He claimed that one of his childhood friends was Baby Face Nelson. As a young man, he worked as a lifeguard (“I swam against Johnny Weissmuller ... and he was so fast I haven't seen him since”), and first worked professionally as a dancer, competing in Charleston contests. In the 1930s, he joined a vaudeville troupe, then began touring with the big bands, playing nightclubs all over the country. During World War II he toured bases with the United Service Organizations.\n\n\"The Tonight Show\", hosted by Jack Paar, marked his first national exposure. For the next several years he worked steadily in Las Vegas, and made hundreds of television appearances on various panel and variety shows. He made occasional recordings, and appeared in a handful of motion pictures, such as \"Three Sailors and a Girl\".\n\nLeonard's comedic method was sarcastic and aggressive, creating an \"insult humor\" genre which anticipated Don Rickles. (Leonard was roastmaster at the Friars' Club roast of Rickles, who he introduced as \"a man who's been doing my act for about 12 years now.\") A trademark line, after taking off his hat to reveal his bald head: \"What did you expect, feathers?\" He also referenced his weight problem in his act. Leonard's strong and unapologetic onstage personality (\"Good evening, opponents!\") belied a gentle and giving spirit that would occasionally be revealed in his act when he would sing a sentimental song.\n\nHe wore a distinctive outfit: a dark suit, purposely two sizes too small, a white narrow-brimmed hat, and horn-rimmed glasses. On one variety show, Leonard's contemporaneous popularity was demonstrated when a lookalike came on stage and did a Leonard-like schtick. Then Leonard walked on stage and addressed his \"doppelgänger\": \"You've got a great future, son, but not in this business!\"\n\nIn March 1973, he collapsed shortly after finishing a performance at the Rainbow Room in New York City and underwent emergency cardiac bypass surgery, but died several weeks later at the age of 63.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2089505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089505", "title": "Je t'aime... moi non plus", "text": "Je t'aime... moi non plus\n\n\"Je t'aime… moi non plus\" (French for \"I love you… me neither\") is a 1967 song written by Serge Gainsbourg for Brigitte Bardot. In 1969, Gainsbourg recorded the best known version with Jane Birkin. The duet reached number one in the UK, and number two in Ireland, but was banned in several countries due to its overtly sexual content.\n\nIn 1976, Gainsbourg directed Birkin in an erotic film of the same name.\n\nThe song was written and recorded in late 1967 for Gainsbourg's girlfriend, Brigitte Bardot. She asked him to write the most beautiful love song he could imagine and that night he wrote \"Je t'aime\" and \"Bonnie and Clyde\". They recorded an arrangement of \"Je t'aime\" by Michel Colombier at a Paris studio in a two-hour session in a small glass booth; the engineer William Flageollet said there was \"heavy petting\". However, news of the recording reached the press and Bardot's husband, German businessman Gunter Sachs, was angry and called for the single to be withdrawn. Bardot pleaded with Gainsbourg not to release it. He complied but observed \"The music is very pure. For the first time in my life, I write a love song and it's taken badly.\"\n\nIn 1968, Gainsbourg and English actress Jane Birkin began a relationship when they met on the set of the film \"Slogan\". After filming, he asked her to record the song with him. Birkin had heard the Bardot version and thought it \"so hot\". She said: \"I only sang it because I didn't want anybody else to sing it\", jealous at the thought of his sharing a recording studio with someone else. Gainsbourg asked her to sing an octave higher than Bardot, \"so you'll sound like a little boy\". It was recorded in an arrangement by Arthur Greenslade in a studio at Marble Arch. Birkin said she \"got a bit carried away with the heavy breathing – so much so, in fact, that I was told to calm down, which meant that at one point I stopped breathing altogether. If you listen to the record now, you can still hear that little gap.\" There was media speculation, as with the Bardot version, that they had recorded live sex, to which Gainsbourg told Birkin, \"Thank goodness it wasn't, otherwise I hope it would have been a long-playing record.\" It was released in February 1969. The single had a plain cover, with the words \"Interdit aux moins de 21 ans\" (forbidden to those under 21), and the record company changed the label from Philips to its subsidiary Fontana.\n\nGainsbourg also asked Marianne Faithfull to record the song with him; she said: \"Hah! He asked everybody\". Others approached included Valérie Lagrange and Mireille Darc. Bardot regretted not releasing her version, and her friend Jean-Louis Remilleux persuaded her to contact Gainsbourg. They released it in 1986.\n\nThe title was inspired by a Salvador Dalí comment: \"Picasso is Spanish, me too. Picasso is a genius, me too. Picasso is a communist, me neither\". Gainsbourg claimed it was an \"anti-fuck\" song about the desperation and impossibility of physical love. The lyrics are written as a dialogue between two lovers during sex. Phrases include: \n\n\"Je vais et je viens, entre tes reins\" (\"I go and I come, between your loins\")\n\"Tu es la vague, moi l'île nue\" (\"You are the wave, I the bare island\")\n\"L'amour physique est sans issue\" (\"Physical love is a dead end\" [Gainsbourg sings 'sensationnel' in another version)\n\"Je t'aime, moi non plus\" is translated as \"I love you – me not anymore\" in the Pet Shop Boys' version. The lyrics are sung, spoken and whispered over a baroque organ and guitar track in C major, with a \"languid, almost over pretty, chocolate box melody\".\n\nThe eroticism was declared offensive. The lyrics are commonly thought to refer to the taboo of sex without love, and were delivered in a breathy, suggestive style. \"The Observer\" Monthly Music magazine called it \"the pop equivalent of an Emmanuelle movie\".\nWhen the version with Bardot was recorded, the French press reported that it was an \"audio vérité\". \"France Dimanche\" said the \"groans, sighs, and Bardot's little cries of pleasure [give] the impression you're listening to two people making love\". The first time Gainsbourg played it in public was in a Paris restaurant immediately after they recorded it. Birkin said that \"as it began to play all you could hear were the knives and forks being put down. 'I think we have a hit record', he said.\"\n\nThe song culminates in orgasm sounds by Birkin: mostly because of this, it was banned from radio in Spain, Sweden, Brazil, the UK, Italy, and Portugal, banned before 11 pm in France, not played by many radio stations in the United States because it was deemed too risqué, and denounced by the Vatican and the \"L'Osservatore Romano\"; one report even claimed the Vatican excommunicated the record executive who released it in Italy. Birkin says Gainsbourg called the Pope \"our greatest PR man\".\n\nBirkin said in 2004 that, \"It wasn't a rude song at all. I don't know what all the fuss was about. The English just didn't understand it. I'm still not sure they know what it means.\" When Gainsbourg went to Jamaica to record with Sly and Robbie, they initially did not get on well. They said \"We know just one piece of French music, a song called 'Je t'aime… Moi Non Plus', which has a girl groaning in it.\" Gainsbourg said \"It's me\", and their mood changed immediately.\n\nThe song was a commercial success throughout Europe. By 1986, it had sold four million copies. In the UK, it was released on the Fontana label, but, after reaching number two, it was withdrawn from sale. Gainsbourg arranged a deal with Major Minor Records and on re-release it reached number one, the first banned number one single in the UK and the first single in a foreign language to top the charts. It stayed on the UK chart for 31 weeks. It even made the Top 100 in the United States, reaching number 58 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart . Mercury Records, the US distributor, faced criticism that the song was \"obscene\" and there was limited airplay, limiting US sales to around 150,000. It was re-released in the UK in late 1974 on the Atlantic Records subsidiary Antic Records and charted again peaking at No. 31 and charting for nine weeks.\n\nThe song has been covered dozens of times, both serious and comedic. In 1969, the Hollywood 101 Strings Orchestra released a 7-inch record single (on A/S Records label) with two versions: the 'A' side featured a fully instrumental recording while the 'B' side had sexually suggestive vocalizations done by Bebe Bardon. The first covers were instrumentals, \"Love at first sight\", after the original was banned; the first version by a British group named Sounds Nice (featuring Tim Mycroft on keyboard) became a top 20 hit. (The group's name \"sounds nice\" actually represents the two words Paul McCartney said when he heard this instrumental cover of the song). The first parody was written in 1970 by Gainsbourg himself and . Titled \"Ça\", it was recorded by Bourvil and , Bourvil's last release before his death. Other comedy versions were made by Frankie Howerd and June Whitfield, Judge Dread, and Gorden Kaye and Vicki Michelle, stars of the BBC TV comedy \"'Allo 'Allo!\", in character.\n\nThe song influenced the 1975 disco classic \"Love to Love You Baby\" by singer Donna Summer and producer Giorgio Moroder. In a note to Neil Bogart, producer A.J. Cervantes (son of politician Alfonso J. Cervantes), who previously worked for Casablanca Records, suggested an idea of Donna Summer recording the song. Bogart initially rejected the idea. Cervantes' record label Butterfly Records released the disco rendition as \"Je t'aime\" by an all-female disco group Saint Tropez in August 1977, the first disco rendition of the song, as part of the album of the same name, \"Je T'aime\" (1977). Prompted by the minor success of Saint Tropez, a year later in 1978, Casablanca Records released the Summer and Moroder duet rendition of \"Je t'aime\" in a 15-minute version for the film \"Thank God It's Friday\". The Summer–Moroder rendition was produced by Moroder and Pete Bellotte.\n\n\"Je t'aime\" has been sampled in many other songs, including: \"A Fair Affair\" by Misty Oldland; \"Guitar Song\" by Texas,and a version of \"Breathe\" in Kylie Minogue's 2003 Money Can't Buy concert at the Hammersmith Apollo in London.\n\nThe song's title was used, partly in French and partly in Russian, as the title of Russian singer Eva Polna's \"Je T'aime (Я тебя тоже нет)\", \"Я тебя тоже нет\" (ya tebya tozhe nyet) meaning \"I (don’t love) you either\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2089518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089518", "title": "The Hrsmn", "text": "The Hrsmn\n\nThe Hrsmn (styled The HRSMN and pronounced \"The Horsemen\") is an American hip hop supergroup that has released one album entitled \"The Horsemen Project\". The group consists of the platinum and gold selling artists, Canibus, Ras Kass, Killah Priest, and Kurupt. The name of the group is in reference to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, who appear in the Book of Revelation from the Bible. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are traditionally named Pestilence, War, Famine, and Death. Throughout the Hrsmn songs, there are many references to each of the members representing one of these entities. They have each frequently appeared on each of the members solo albums, such as Canibus's \"2000 B.C. (Before Can-I-Bus)\" and Killah Priest's \"Priesthood\". Other affiliated members include Chino XL, and Pharoahe Monch (who acted as the hype man on the leaked \"Im A Horseman (Promo)\" and also rapped on \"Horsemen\" from Canibus's \"2000 B.C. (Before Can-I-Bus)\".\n\nOn April 9, Chino XL's debut album \"Here to Save You All\" was released, it featured the first collaboration between Chino XL and Ras Kass on the track titled \"Riiiot!\".\n\nOn January 14, the \"Rhyme & Reason: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\" was released, it featured the first collaboration between Ras Kass and Canibus on a track entitled \"Uni-4-Orm\".\n\nLate in March a white label appeared featuring a Hrsmn track titled \"Abide By\". The track featured the same lyrics as later heard in \"Horsementality\" (from Canibus's \"2000 B.C. (Before Can-I-Bus)\"), and the beat was from the E-Swift produced \"Hip Hop Drunkies\" from the album \"Likwidation\" by Tha Alkaholiks. On September the 22nd Ras Kass's second album \"Rasassination\" was released, it featured the first collaboration between Ras Kass and Kurupt.\n\nIn February in an interview for \"The Source\", Kurupt stated that Dr. Dre and Daz Dillinger would be helping with production on the Hrsmn album. As of now the idea of Dr. Dre and Daz Dillinger handling production on a Hrsmn album has never come to fruition. On October 19 Pharoahe Monch's debut solo album \"Internal Affairs\" was released, it featured the first collaboration between Canibus and Pharoahe Monch.\n\nOn May 9 Killah Priest's second album \"View from Masada\" was released. The album featured two Hrsmn collaborations, the first was a song called \"What Part of the Game?\" which featured Ras Kass, and the second was \"Bop Your Head\" which featured Canibus. There is also a shoutout in the sleeve stating \"Four Horsemen, Canibus, Ras Kass, (Kurupt catch you on the next one)\", meaning he was planning on working with Kurupt on his next album. The words \"Horsemen, Horsemen\" are also briefly repeated by Killah Priest on the outro track.\n\nOn August 20 in an interview with RapReviews.com Canibus shed some light on the status of The Hrsmn. He stated the name would be changed from \"The Four Horsemen\" to just \"Horsemen\", and under this title Ras Kass, Pharoahe Monch, Killah Priest, and Kurupt would be appearing on his new album, \"2000 B.C. (Before Can-I-Bus)\". He also mentions the idea of other members joining the group, such as Lonnie B and Danja Mowf (from the Supafriendz), and that they are currently looking for more members.\n\nIn September Killah Priest stated in an interview that he had not spoken to Ras Kass since he had been locked up but he did say \"we’re still going to do the HRSMN joint.\" Later on in the same month ripthejacker.net reported that Canibus had \"been quite busy along with Killah Priest and Ras Kass. They have begun re-recording and building the HRSMN album! It will feature a cast of emcees not before a part of the group and it will be out the Summer of 2004 on Mic Club. Updates will be included in a new Media News section at Micclub.net so stay tuned.\" A Hrsmn album was never released in 2004 on Mic Club and a \"Media News\" section on the website never appeared. Also in September during an interview Canibus sparked rumors that other members would be joining the group such as Crooked I, Pak Man, Kool G Rap, Royce Da 5'9\", Keith Murray, Journalist, Common, Rakim, Vinnie Paz (from Jedi Mind Tricks), Pace Won and Young Zee (from the Outsidaz), and Lonnie B and Danja Mowf (from the Supafriendz). It has still not been confirmed whether they will actually be included in the group.\n\nIn October, Killah Priest and Dreddy Kruger released a nine track album entitled \"The Horsemen Project\", it was released independently through \"Think Differently Music\"/\"Proverbs Music Inc.\" and was only available to purchase off the internet. Each track featured at least two members of the group as well as an appearance by Pak Man. It is currently unknown who handled the majority of the production on the album, although it is known that Mark Sparks was responsible for two songs.\n\nDuring January in an interview conducted by AllHipHop.com, Ras Kass stated that Kurupt had contacted him while he was in prison, and that he was currently looking for a major label to distribute a new Hrsmn album. On February 18 it was announced that Killah Priest would be appearing on Chino XL's next album, \"Poison Pen\".\n\nDuring March an apparently unreleased Hrsmn track was to emerge on Pak Man's debut album \"Chow Time,\" unfortunately the track turned out to be the previously released \"Horsemen Are Here\" (which also featured on \"The Horsemen Project\" under the shorter title \"Horsemen\"). Once again during March, another apparently unreleased Hrsmn track was set to appear in the form of a collaboration with Canibus and Kurupt. The track, titled \"Not 4 Play\", was scheduled to appear on Canibus's new album \"Mind Control\", unfortunately it turned out to be the previously released \"Scrolls\" from \"The Horsemen Project\".\n\nTowards the end of March during an interview with RasKass-Central.com, Ras Kass shed some light on the status of a new Hrsmn album:-\n\nFor an interview conducted with ThaFormula.com, Killah Priest stated that various members have tracks that were recorded, and he hopes that they can once again come together.\n\nEarly in November in an interview with HipHopSite.com Ras Kass stated that once he can sort out his own \"business\" he would be interest in recording a new Hrsmn album. On November 18 in an interview conducted with HipHopDX.com Ras Kass once again stated his interest in working with The Hrsmn. On November 24 in an interview conducted with ChinoXL-Central.com, Chino XL stated that he has worked with each of the main members of The Hrsmn, and he hopes that a new Hrsmn album would eventually appear. \nTowards the end of November during an interview conducted by WuForever.com Killah Priest stated that a new Hrsmn album would be recorded.\n\nOn January 23 it was announced that the main members will be present on Killah Priest's then upcoming album The Offering. On March 17 the Chino XL album \"Poison Pen\" was released featuring the Killah Priest collaboration \"Beastin\". On Killah Priest's May 1 journal entry at HipHopGame.com he mentioned The Hrsmn and the possibility of a new album. He said \"The Horsemen project is definitely going to come. Right now we just have to get Kurupt. He's been doing the Dogg Pound thing, but it's definitely going to come. We have songs recorded and we have more in store.\" On November 29 on Phathom's MySpace page, a track featuring Canibus, Chino XL and Crooked I was released, it also appeared on his album \"Poetical Minded\".\n\nOn the Canibus album \"For Whom the Beat Tolls\" Killah Priest is featured together with Sun on the track \"Liquid Wordz\". The Hrsmn also collaborate on Killah Priest's album The Offering on the song \"Inner G\", produced by 4th Disciple.\n\nRecently, member Kurupt announced plans to effect a Hrsmn reunion album featuring himself, Canibus, Killah Priest and Ras Kass. It was later reported that the group had reformed, with business-related assistance from M-Eighty, A&R and executive producer of Canibus' \"Melatonin Magik\". Recently The Hrsmn have appeared on a track from Ras Kass' newest album 'A.D.I.D.A.S'. In an August 2010 radio interview with Mista Montana, Killah Priest discussed the creation of the Four Horsemen album, stating that they plan to bring in producers from all their camps.\n\nIn 2011, a video appeared announcing a summer release date for the group's album. Member Ras Kass described it as a \"sintro,\" or alternately a \"trailer,\" featuring text lyrics to a song called \"The End is Near.\" Kass went on to divulge that the Wu-Tang Clan's RZA will be executive-producing the album, and will produce \"two or three\" tracks for the album. The group hopes to land production from DJ Premier. Guest appearances will include RBX (their upcoming first single, \"Impossible\"), RZA, Ghostface Killah and Prodigal Sunn of the Wu-Tang camp, while Mos Def and Pharoahe Monch are \"listed as possibilities.\"\n\nPreviously, group member Kurupt revealed that a collaboration with Slaughterhouse was in the works, listing possible titles as \"House of Horses\" and \"The Four Slaughters.\"\n\nOn January 28, 2012, Ras Kass announced that he was resigning from The Hrsmn, and is no longer a part of the group.\n\nIn February 2014, there was a post of a few pictures on Twitter and Facebook by Ras Kass and also Canibus & Kurupt's A&R Matthew Markoff with a picture of Kurupt, Ras Kass, & Killah Priest and the words HRSMN 2014. Markoff also added that there will be a new recorded HRSMN track released soon and album coming later.\n\nA new HRSMN track with all the original four members called \"Historic\" (featuring Tragedy Khadafi) appeared on Canibus' new album \"Fait Accompli\".\n\nOn June 3, 2014 Ras Kass reunited with the group.\n\nIn 2015, Killah Priest and Kurupt appeared on Canibus' 14th solo release \"Time Flys, Life Dies...Phoenix Rise\" - Killah Priest appeared on a song titled, \"Bronze Horses\" referring to Bronze Nazareth who produced the album.\n\nStudio albums\n\nEPs\n\nGuest appearances (group)\n\nGuest appearances (solo)\n\n"}

{"id": "2089534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089534", "title": "Megaron", "text": "Megaron\n\nThe megaron (; , ), plural \"megara\" , was the great hall in ancient Greek palace complexes. Architecturally, it was a rectangular hall that was surrounded by four columns, fronted by an open, two-columned portico, and had a central, open hearth that vented though an oculus in the roof. The megaron also contained the throne-room of the \"wanax\", or Mycenaean ruler, whose throne was located in the main room with the central hearth. Similar architecture is found in the Ancient Near East though the presence of the open portico, generally supported by columns, is particular to the Aegean. Megara are sometimes referred to as \"long-rooms\", as defined by their rectangular (non-square) shape and the position of their entrances, which are always along the shorter wall so that the depth of the space is larger than the width. There were often many rooms around the central megaron, such as archive rooms, offices, oil-press rooms, workshops, potteries, shrines, corridors, armories, and storerooms for such goods as wine, oil and wheat.\n\nRectilinear halls were a characteristic theme of ancient Greek architecture. The Mycenaean megaron originated and evolved from the \"megaroid\", or large hall-centered rectangular building, of mainland Greece dating back to the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age. Furthermore, it served as the architectural precursor to the Greek temples of the Archaic and Classical periods. With respect to its structural layout, the megaron includes a columned entrance, a pronaos and a central naos (cella) with early versions of it having one of many roof types (i.e., pitched, flat, barrel). The roof, specifically, was supported by wooden beams and since the aforesaid roof types are always destroyed in the remnants of the early megaron, the definite roof type is unknown. The floor was made of patterned concrete and covered in carpet. The walls, constructed out of mud brick, were decorated with fresco paintings. There were wood-ornamented metal doors, often two-leaved, and footbaths were also used in the megaron as attested in Homer's \"Odyssey\" where Odysseus's feet were washed by Eurycleia. The proportions involving a larger length than width are similar structurally to early Doric temples.\n\nThe megaron was used for sacrificial processions, as well as for royal functions and court meetings.\n\nA famous megaron is in the large reception hall of the king in the palace of Tiryns, the main room of which had a raised throne placed against the right wall and a central hearth bordered by four Minoan-style wooden columns that served as supports for the roof. The Cretan elements in the Tiryns megaron were adopted by the Mycenaeans from the palace type found in Minoan architecture. Frescoes from Pylos show figures eating and drinking, which were important activities in Greek culture. Artistic portrayals of bulls, a common zoomorphic motif in Mycenaean vase painting, appear on Greek megaron frescoes such as the one in the Pylos megaron where a bull is depicted at the center of a Mycenaean procession. Other famous megara include the ones at the Mycenaean palaces of Thebes and Mycenae. Different Greek cultures had their own unique megara; for example, the people of the Greek mainland tended to separate their central megaron from the other rooms whereas the Cretans did not do this.\n\n\n\n"}

The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They had a crew of 6 officers and 108 enlisted men.\n\nPerformance differed radically between the ships of the class, often due to poor workmanship. The \"Clemson\" class was powered by two steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of intended to reach a speed of . The ships carried a maximum of of fuel oil which was intended gave them a range of at .\n\nThe ships were armed with four 4-inch (102 mm) guns in single mounts and were fitted with two 1-pounder guns for anti-aircraft defense. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) guns. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A \"Y-gun\" depth charge thrower was added to many ships.\n\n\"John Francis Burnes\", named for John Francis Burnes, formerly \"Swasey\", was laid down 4 July 1918 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, San Francisco, California; launched 10 November 1918; sponsored by Mrs. Julius Kahn; and commissioned 1 May 1920, Commander Frank N. Eklund in command. Following shakedown and training exercises during the summer of 1920, \"John Francis Burnes\" engaged in fleet maneuvers during October. For the next 2 years she continued tactical exercises along the California coast, operating out of San Diego, California, her home port. She sailed 6 February 1923 for exercises off Mexico and the Panama Canal Zone. Following her return in April, \"John Francis Burnes\" operated out of California for 2 years with the exception of fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean in early 1924. One year later she participated in joint Army-Navy maneuvers out of San Francisco, California before joining fleet operations in Hawaii 27 April 1925. The destroyer then cruised with a large force in the Pacific, visiting Samoa, Australia, and New Zealand before returning to San Diego in September.\n\nFor the next 3 years she engaged in training operations and fleet maneuvers along the West Coast, developing the techniques in naval warfare. During the summers of 1928 and 1929, \"John Francis Burnes\" engaged in reserve training cruises. \"John Francis Burnes\" arrived in San Diego 28 August 1929 and remained there until she decommissioned 25 February 1930. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 22 July 1930 and sold as scrap metal 10 June 1931 in accordance with the London Treaty for the limitation of naval armaments.\n\nAs of 2005, no other ship in the United States Navy has been named \"John Francis Burnes\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2089539", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089539", "title": "Harris (train)", "text": "Harris (train)\n\nThe Harris trains were the first steel-bodied Electric Multiple Unit train to operate on the suburban railway network of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. They were introduced in 1956, by the Victorian Railways, and last operated in 1988, although a number of the carriages were converted for other uses and are still operating. They were named after Norman Charles Harris, Chairman of Commissioners of the Victorian Railways, between 1940 and 1950.\nThe Harris trains were commonly referred to as \"Blue Trains\" due to their deep blue colour, with only a yellow band about halfway up the body. Royal blue and yellow were common colours for the Victorian Railways rolling stock.\n\nThe trains had a saloon seating layout, divided into smaller sections by full-height partitions. They were provided with either two or three sets of hand-operated dual sliding doors per carriage side. Later sets were fitted with power doors. Interiors were split into smoking and no-smoking compartments until late 1978, with the abolition of smoking on trains, and carriages were designated as First or Second class until 1958, when one class travel was introduced. Most of the carriages were delivered without end gangways between carriages, but safety concerns led to these being added in the final five sets as delivered from mid-1966. These sets were also fitted with only two doors per carriage side rather than three, permitting additional seating and reflecting the increasing average travel distance.\n\nThe first thirty trains were fitted with automatic couplers at both ends of all carriages, and the second series with semi-permanent drawbars, except for the driving ends of motor carriages, and one end of BT carriages. Later, drawbars were fitted in the middle of first series blocks and units, although the final ten Motor cars had automatic couplers at both ends.\n\nFirst-series motor cars had 59 second-class seats and trailers 72 seats (first class in the T cars or second class in the BT cars), divided into smoking and non-smoking sections. For the second series the internal partitions were removed, and capacities increased to 65 and 80 passengers respectively for a total gain of 50 seats per seven-car train. Smoking was then only permitted in the middle third of each carriage. Later, a policy change saw smoking permitted in the whole of each Motor carriage, and not at all in trailers.\n\nThe Harris trains were originally run as 7-carriage (M-T-T-M-BT-T-M) sets, reduced to 4-carriage (M-T-T-M) sets for off-peak and weekend services. The M-T-T-M sets were known as \"Blocks\", while the BT-T-M sets were called \"Units\". The first thirty 7-car sets were delivered between 1956 and 1959, and the following thirty sets between 1961 and 1967. Initially the two types were kept separate because of the differing motor unit performance, and within the second series the final five trains had to be kept separate because of the inter-carriage walkways. This proved difficult to manage and in 1962 the segregation instruction was withdrawn. The first carriage to have walkways retrofitted was 862T in 1967, when it was rebuilt following fire damage.\n\nIn 1968-69 a further ten Motor cars were delivered. At the same time, some of the Units were reduced to BT-M only and allocated to the Sandringham Line, and these actions together allowed for the formation of additional M-T-T-M blocks so that eight-car trains could run on busier routes including Lilydale, Belgrave and Glen Waverley. Later platform extensions permitted operation of eight-car trains on the Frankston, Pakenham, Alamein, Upfield, Broadmeadows, St Alans and Williamstown lines. Occasionally, M-M pairs would also be used on shuttle services between Dandenong and Pakenham.\n\nWhen the extended trailer cars entered service they were coupled to the new M cars, which had their power-closing door equipment activated or installed as required. The first set was 799M-891T-892T-800M (order unclear), and two more blocks were assembled using four of the seven motors in the range 792M-798M. In 1972 further cars 791M, 887T-890T and 557BT-560BT had the same equipment installed, giving a total of ten motors, six extended and four regular trailers and four backing trailers available to assemble three Long Blocks and four Units fitted with power door equipment. At this point, the total fleet would have been 62 Short Blocks, 3 Long Blocks with power-closing doors, 4 Pairs, 52 normal units and 4 Units with power-closing doors.\n\nAnother difference between the first- and second-series trains was the destination rolls; the former had included Carnegie, North Williamstown, Elsternwick, Ashburton, Blackburn, Macaulay, Thomastown and Rosanna, which were replaced in the latter with Mentone, Crib Point, Holmesglen, Belgrave and Upfield.\n\nThe first 30 7-carriage trains, known as the first series, were constructed in the United Kingdom by Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, and delivered between 1956 and 1959. Another 30, the second series, were built by Martin & King in Melbourne, and delivered between 1961 and 1967. From 1966, these were delivered with end doors and gangways between carriages, allowing passengers to change carriages.\n\nThe first series of \"T\" and \"BT\" trailers were built by Comeng (the first 10 in Sydney, the rest in Melbourne), and finished by Martin & King, with the remainder built at the Newport Workshops. Between 1968 and 1970, ten additional motor carriages, built by the Victorian Railways' Newport Workshops, were delivered to provide for some Harris trains to be lengthened to eight carriages.\n\nIn 1970 and 1971, six new trailer carriages were built as prototypes for the next fleet (the Hitachi trains). These carriages were long, compared to of the earlier carriages, and were equipped with the mechanisms for power-closing doors, the first such use in Melbourne. However, it was not until the following year that a complete (4-carriage) train was used this way, after conversion of some motor carriages. These carriages were converted into H type carriages, for use in LH sets with V/Line, in the mid 1980s.\n\nBy the time the first ten 7-car sets had been delivered, it was found that the buffing plates between carriages would bind when going around tight curves or through complicated point-work, so this equipment was removed in time for delivery of the 11th train. However, this left a lot of slack between carriages, so acceleration and braking would be both rough and noisy.\n\nAround the same time, the Victorian Railways was experimenting with replacing cast-iron brake blocks with a non-metallic compound (probably asbestos), so Set 11 was fitted with these, and tested between Seaford and Frankston, in 5 mph increments up to line speed, in both directions. Four tests were made - first using the non-metallic brake blocks with empty and later loaded with cast-iron blocks, equal in weight to a crush load of passengers, and then with the cast iron brake blocks fitted to the train, as well as simulating the load, and finally the empty train with cast iron brake blocks. It was found that the new type of brake blocks performed better at higher speeds, but worse at lower speeds, so on average they gave similar performance and were approved for use. A similar test was later conducted with the Walker railmotors between Laverton and Werribee.\n\nIn the 1960s the fleet was fitted with Guard-to-Driver bell communication circuits.\n\nWheel slip was found to be a problem with the more powerful 500-series motors, so in the late 1960s through early 1970s the \"weak field\" power generation, which used the back-EMF from the motors, was disconnected. 547M was fitted with an experimental wheel-slip solution, but the final implementation as applied across the fleet would close off the power supply, then re-open it bypassing the acceleration control when wheel-slip was detected, with limited success. The weak-field system was reconnected in the late 1970s to early 1980s in order to keep up with amended timetables, but this brought back the wheel slip issues.\n\nBy the time the second series (700+) Harris cars were being delivered, the design had been improved somewhat. A second window was fitted at the front of the Motor carriages for the guard and/or instructor driver to view the track, along with a window from the Guard's compartment into the passenger saloon, and walkways were added between all carriages within each Block or Unit. These latter changes were retrofitted to many of the 500-series carriages as well, following concerns about safety. While the 500-series trains had rotary flettner ventilators fitted; these were mounted on the curve of the roof and spun off-centre, causing a grinding noise. This was fixed in the second series with the units fitted level to the carriage floor. These units were also later fitted to the clerestory-roofed Tait stock, with their opening ceiling-windows being sealed to reduce maintenance costs.\n\nThe last few vehicles constructed were used as test-beds for features in the upcoming Hitachi train design. 560BT, when issued to service, had a short stainless steel exterior panel between the centre windows. Similar stainless steel panels were placed around bridgeworks at East Richmond, the purpose of both to check for weathering and cleaning methods. The last six trailer vehicles, 891-896T, were 75 ft long over body instead of 60 ft to test clearances at platforms and junctions along with passenger flows. However, the cars were significantly heavier and when coupled to 700-series motors already featuring weaker acceleration further impacting timekeeping.\n\nWhile the last ten motors (791M-800M) were issued without asbestos insulation, only the last three had additional insulation in the ceiling. 799M was a further modification of the type with a forced draught ventilation system, shared with the long trailers, while 798M and 800M used the normal flettner ventilators. Similarly, 556-560BT and the long trailers were not fitted with asbestos.\n\nBy the mid-1970s individual Harris cars were being sent to Bendigo North Workshops for fitting of end doors and gangways. Examples included 702M, 621T and 684T in September 1975.\n\n719M was the first Harris car of any type to be scrapped, due to fire damage at Sunshine in February 1973. It was scrapped at Newport Workshops on 16 September 1975, having been judged as too expensive to repair.\n\nWith the exceptions of the last few carriages built, all Harris trains contained asbestos insulation. The first sets contained blue asbestos, and the later sets contained white asbestos. Due to the presence of asbestos, most were disposed of in the 1990s, by being buried in an old quarry in Clayton, a south-eastern suburb of Melbourne, some having been wrapped in plastic.\n\nNo original Harris trailer cars remain, with all trailers having been converted to locomotive-hauled H cars or scrapped. Additionally, no first series motor units were preserved, the three remaining unmodified cars being high-numbered second series M cars.\n\nIn the mid 1980s three cars were painted pink on the ends and one side for a railway safety video. The set was 780M-674T-1555M, and operated with locomotive T334, with filming taking place primarily on the Geelong-Gheringhap line. The motor cars had their pantographs removed for the duration of filming.\n\nA set of four carriages was refurbished in the late 80s and repainted into an experimental green and yellow livery for The Met. However, the Minister for Transport at the time didn't like the colour scheme and, without the train having moved, ordered it repainted into the traditional blue and gold scheme. The motor cars are known to have been 521M and 528M, and the trailers are believed to have been 641T and 863T.\n\nA program to refurbish the Harris trains began in 1982. The interior of the refurbished cars resembled a Comeng interior, having individual vinyl foam type seat cushions on an integrated plastic frame, replacing the former more traditional vinyl sprung seats. The refurbished cars also had air conditioning, and a new colour scheme. Due to their predominantly grey livery, the refurbished trains were known as \"Grey Ghosts\".\n\nThe motor units were originally numbered in the 601-608M range, though these numbers later came into conflict with the Comeng fleet, and so in mid-late 1984, the cars were renumbered into the 901-908M range. The trailers were released to service in the 101-108T range, becoming 1501-1508T in 1983, and then 3501-3508T in 1984.\n\nIndustrial and other problems with the refurbished trains meant that only 16 carriages were converted before the program was stopped, and the refurbished trains were withdrawn in 1991, with five motor units (901M and 904-907M) cut up for scrap. One refurbished carriage, 903M, has been preserved, and is on display at the Australian Railway Historical Society Museum at North Williamstown. All eight refurbished trailer cars were converted to standard H type passenger cars, along with motors 902M and 908M which were converted to the BCH sub-class.\n\nThe four refurbished trains ran initially in an M-T-T-M configuration, but three of the trains were later remarshalled to M-T-M-M-T-M configuration.\n\nThe refurbished trains generally ran on the Port Melbourne, St Kilda and Sandringham lines. They never ran in the City Loop, except for a farewell tour on 6 April 1991. The restriction to these three lines was due to the additional weight of the refurbished carriages; while the passenger areas were upgraded and included two air conditioning units per car, the mechanical components were still unmodified, and still using the 1960s-era second series motors, which were in fact less powerful than the first series cars of 1956.\n\n55 carriages, including the carriages, were converted to H type carriages for interurban service and are still in operation with V/Line as of May 2020. These trains are currently being refurbished, and will continue in service until at least 2022.\n\nSimilarly, four carriages were converted to MTH carriages, which were used as trailer cars behind DERM and DRC railmotors for many years. In later years, they were used on the Stony Point line, behind A class diesel locomotives until 26 April 2008, when Sprinter trains were introduced on the route. MTH102 was converted to a special overhead inspection car for Metro Trains Melbourne, and is now numbered IEV102.\n\nWith most of the fleet being buried due to asbestos, or converted to H-type carriages, only four have survived.\n\nMotor cars 795M and refurbished 903M (both pictured below) are preserved at the Australian Railway Historical Society Museum.\n\nGreaser cars 794M and 797M are owned by VicTrack, and are stored at Newport Workshops.\n\nA note in Newsrail, May 1989, indicated that seven cars, with asbestos components removed, were to be preserved as an operational set, using cars 1522M, 798M, 799M, 2515T, 2606T, 2850T and 883T, in conjunction with The Met's celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the Melbourne railway electrification project. However, all those cars were placed off-register in 1990. It is worth noting that 798M and 799M were built without either blue or white asbestos insulation.\n\nBrimbank Models has developed a range of 3D-printed Harris carriages and components which can be purchased and assembled for standard mechanisms. The carriages will be available as complete-body kits, or as a range of parts. The cost is generally around $80 per carriage plus mechanisms for motor cars, which the purchaser must source separately.\n\n"}
{"id": "2089542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089542", "title": "Viper (Marvel Comics)", "text": "Viper (Marvel Comics)\n\nViper is the name of four fictional characters, supervillains appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The first Viper, Jordan Stryke, first appeared in \"Captain America\" #157 (January 1973), created by Steve Englehart, Steve Gerber, Sal Buscema and John Verpoorten. He was killed by the second Viper who took his name, but Stryke later reappeared alive without explanation. A third Viper was part of Sin's Serpent Squad, but was later killed by the Scourge of the Underworld.\n\nJordan Stryke, originally known as Jordan Dixon, began his criminal career alongside his brother Leopold, known as the Eel. The two initially worked for the Cowled Commander but were stopped by Captain America and Falcon. Later on Viper, Eel and Cobra formed the first version of the Serpent Squad. While in custody Jordan Stryke is attacked by Madame Hydra who kills Stryke and takes the name \"Viper\". Years later Jordan Stryke reappears alive without any explanation of how and takes control of the Serpent Society. Stryke reorganizes the Society into Serpent Solutions.\n\nThe first known Viper (Jordan Stryke, also known as Jordan Dixon) was created by Steve Englehart, Steve Gerber, Sal Buscema and John Verpoorten and first appeared in \"Captain America\" #157 (January 1973).\n\nJordan Stryke (a.k.a. Jordan Dixon) was the brother of Leopold Stryke, also known as the costumed criminal Eel. They each formed costumed identities without the other realizing this fact. Viper concealed this fact by using the alias of \"Dixon\" as his everyday last name. Together they joined the Crime Wave of the Cowled Commander, and the Viper battled the Falcon and Captain America. During the course of the fight, Viper managed to poison his opponents with darts and escaped. Later, the Falcon discovered the Viper in his home after tracking his alias (through an offhand comment made by the Viper indicating that he was involved in advertising) and captured him. Escaping in an ensuing battle with Plantman and the rest of the Crime Wave, Viper’s identity was discovered by his brother Eel. Soon after, the Crime Wave was defeated by Captain America and the Falcon, and they were sent to prison.\n\nLater escaping prison with his brother and the help of the Cobra, the trio formed the original Serpent Squad and attacked Captain America at his girlfriend's home in Virginia. Despite new weapons added to his arsenal, including the Venom-Firer and prosthetic fangs, the Viper and his partners were returned to jail. While in custody, he was being taken to appear before a grand jury by U.S. Marshals. The van he was transported in was attacked by Madame Hydra, and his guards were killed. Believing himself rescued by his Serpent Squad, Viper rushed out of the van, only to be told by Madame Hydra that she wanted a new name – his name. Despite offering to change his moniker, the Viper was gunned down and killed, and Madame Hydra assumed the name and leadership of the Serpent Squad. Later, his soul fragment was discovered by Hell’s Angel and the X-Men in Mephisto’s realm and, with Jordan Stryke’s usual luck, even this was destroyed.\n\nAs part of the \"All-New, All-Different Marvel,\" Viper somehow turned up alive and has assembled the other snake-themed villains to join the Serpent Society under its new name of Serpent Solutions.\n\nViper appears in the 2017 \"Secret Empire\" storyline where he and the rest of the Serpent Society are among the villains recruited by Baron Helmut Zemo to join the Army of Evil.\n\nA new Viper appeared along with Sin's new Serpent Squad in the pages of \"Captain America\". His true identity has yet to be revealed. He breaks Crossbones out of jail and later attacked the White House, but he was stopped by the new Captain America. Following that, he and the rest of the Squad took part in a plot to use madbombs to cause rioting in New York City. After being captured, Viper asked to go into the Witness Protection Program in exchange for information. He had only been in the program for less than a month when he was targeted by the villain killer Scourge and killed after being shot twice in the head.\n\nWhile regaining his franchises, Roderick Kingsley sold one of Madame Hydra's Viper outfits to an unnamed criminal in order to become his version of Viper.\n\nViper has no superhuman abilities, and relies upon his mind and trained fighting skills to win battles. Very intelligent, he is a skilled debater and advertiser, and he is skilled enough in chemistry to create his own special form of venom. He wears venom-tipped claws and employs venom-tipped darts.\n\nThe third Viper possessed great physical strength but was lacking in hand-to-hand combat skills. In battles with both the Steve Rogers and Bucky versions of Captain America, he was taken out easily by a kick to the head. He used a wrist blaster that could fire poison darts.\n\nDuring the 2017 \"Secret Wars\" storyline, the Battleworld domain of the Hydra Empire has a group called the Vipers who work for Hydra. They are a group of female assassins that wear Hydra's version of the Symbiotes on their bodies and are led by Venom who sports the same type of Symbiote as the Vipers. The Vipers first appeared with Venom where they attacked the Resistance. While most of the Resistance was killed in the ensuing battle, Venom managed to infect Captain America and Sharon Carter's daughter Ellie Rogers with a Symbiote which slowly started to turn her into a Viper.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2089545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089545", "title": "Prometheus Rising", "text": "Prometheus Rising\n\nPrometheus Rising is a book by Robert Anton Wilson first published in 1983. It is a guide book of \"how to get from here to there\", an amalgam of Timothy Leary's 8-circuit model of consciousness, Gurdjieff's self-observation exercises, Alfred Korzybski's general semantics, Aleister Crowley's magical theorems, Sociobiology, Yoga, relativity, and quantum mechanics, amongst other approaches to understanding the world around us, and claiming to be a short book (under 300 pages) about how the human mind works and how to get the most use from one. Wilson describes it as an \"owner's manual for the human brain\".\n\nThe book examines many aspects of social mind control and mental imprinting, and provides mind exercises at the end of every chapter, with the goal of giving the reader more control over how one's mind works. The book has found many readers among followers of alternative culture, and discusses the effect of certain psychoactive substances and how these affect the brain, tantric breathing techniques, and other methods and holistic approaches to expanding consciousness. It draws a parallel between the development of one's mind and the development of higher intelligence theorized by biological evolution.\n\n\"Prometheus Rising\" was copyrighted and published in 1983 but began as Wilson's Ph.D. dissertation called \"The Evolution of Neuro-Sociological Circuits: A Contribution to the Sociobiology of Consciousness\" in 1978-79 for Paideia University in California. In 1982, while in Ireland, Wilson rewrote the manuscript for commercial publication, removing footnotes, improving the style, adding chapters and exercises, and sketching out diagrams for the illustrations. Eventually Wilson submitted the work to New Falcon Publications, which accepted it within 48 hours. Wilson received his advance 48 hours after that, according to his preface in the tenth printing of \"Prometheus Rising\".\n\nThe current edition also includes an introduction by Israel Regardie.\n\nA brief comment made by Wilson in the book became the main seed thought for \"The Sekhmet Hypothesis\". Wilson suggested that the gentle angel symbol from Ezekiel in the bible had its modern correlation with the flower child of the Sixties. The author of \"The Sekhmet Hypothesis\", Iain Spence, went on to compare Ezekiel's other symbols to various pop cultural trends. In \"Prometheus Rising\", Wilson compared the four Life Positions of Transactional Analysis to the four main Life Positions presented in Timothy Leary's earlier interpersonal circumplex grid. Spence favored Leary's model and used it to describe the moods of atavistic pop culture. \n\n\"Prometheus Rising\" is listed as one of the ten seminal works of extropian thought in the Extropianism FAQ. It was also listed on Max More's reading list for extropians, the Immortality Institute's reading list in \"The Scientific Conquest of Death\", and other reading lists for extropians and transhumans.\n"}
{"id": "2089552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089552", "title": "Mokelumne River", "text": "Mokelumne River\n\nThe Mokelumne River ( or ) is a -long river in northern California in the United States. The river flows west from a rugged portion of the central Sierra Nevada into the Central Valley and ultimately the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, where it empties into the San Joaquin River-Stockton Deepwater Shipping Channel. Together with its main tributary, the Cosumnes River, the Mokelumne drains in parts of five California counties. Measured to its farthest source at the head of the North Fork, the river stretches for .\n\nThe river is colloquially divided into the Upper Mokelumne River, which stretches from the headwaters to Pardee Reservoir in the Sierra foothills, and the Lower Mokelumne River, which refers to the portion of the river below Camanche Dam. In its lower course, the Mokelumne is used heavily for irrigation and also provides water for the east San Francisco Bay Area through the Mokelumne Aqueduct. Several major tributaries of the river have been developed for the generation of hydroelectric power.\n\nThe name is Plains Miwok and is constructed from \"moke\", meaning fishnet, and \"-umne\", a suffix meaning \"people of\". The town of Mokelumne Hill was named for the river in about 1850.\n\nThe Mokelumne is formed by the confluence of several forks that rise in the central Sierra Nevada in the Stanislaus National Forest. The North Fork is the largest, originating at Highland Lakes at an elevation of . From its source it flows north then west for to Salt Springs Reservoir. Below Salt Springs it receives the Bear River from the north and then passes through the smaller Tiger Creek Reservoir before joining with the Middle Fork southeast of Pine Grove. The lower portion of the North Fork defines the border between Amador and Calaveras Counties.\n\nThe Middle Fork rises at on the west side of Bailey Ridge, near Ganns. It flows generally west, past Wilseyville and West Point, to its confluence with the North Fork. The South Fork begins at an elevation of very near the head of the Middle Fork, and flows west , roughly parallel and south of the Middle Fork, to join the Middle Fork about above the confluence of the North and Middle Forks.\n\nThe confluence of the North and Middle Forks forms the Mokelumne River proper. The main stem flows west-southwest past Mokelumne Hill into Pardee Reservoir, formed by the -high Pardee Dam. Below Pardee the river flows directly into Camanche Reservoir, formed by Camanche Dam. The entire stretch of the Mokelumne between the forks and a point just above Camanche Dam defines the Amador—Calaveras county line; below here, it flows westwards into San Joaquin County.\n\nThe Camanche Dam is the first non-passable barrier for anadromous fish. Below Camanche Dam the Mokelumne meanders to its confluence with the San Joaquin River, first continuing southwest out of the Sierra foothills past Lockeford and then turning northwest at Lodi, where the small Woodbridge Dam impounds the river, forming Lodi Lake. The river receives Dry Creek from the east near Thornton and shortly afterwards receives its major tributary, the Cosumnes River, from the northeast. At this point, the river has reached its northernmost point about south of Sacramento.\n\nThe river continues west then south into the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta where it becomes tidal and splits into a pair of distributaries, the North and South Mokelumne River (not to be confused with the North and South Forks in the Mokelumne headwaters) which together encircle the of Staten Island. About downstream the branches rejoin, and two miles (3.2 km) below this point the Mokelumne flows into the San Joaquin River.\n\nThe Mokelumne River watershed drains in parts of Alpine, Amador, Calaveras, San Joaquin, and Sacramento Counties. Elevations range from sea level at the confluence with the San Joaquin River to at the crest of the Sierra Nevada in the headwaters of the North Fork.\n\nThe Mokelumne watershed divide borders the basins of the American River on the north, the Calaveras and Stanislaus rivers to the south, and the Carson River to the east. The American, Calaveras and Stanislaus rivers, like the Mokelumne, drain westwards into the Central Valley, while the Carson flows eastwards into the Great Basin. Drainage within the Mokelumne watershed generally occurs from east to west with all of the perennial streams originating in the Sierra Nevada.\n\nThe Mokelumne River and its headwater forks above Lodi drain the southernmost part of the basin. The part of the basin above Pardee Dam is referred to as the Upper Mokelumne River Basin and drains about , or 25.7% of the total watershed. The Cosumnes River and its own North, Middle and South forks drain about in the northern part of the basin, or about 33.8% of the total watershed. Dry Creek, which itself is formed by four Sierra streams – Jackson, Sutter, Amador and Rancheria Creeks – drains most of the area between the upper Mokelumne and Cosumnes basins, or about .\n\nThe upper watershed is situated principally in Alpine, Amador and Calaveras Counties and consists mostly of wilderness managed under various federal designations. Most of the Mokelumne and Cosumnes River headwaters lie within the Stanislaus and Eldorado National Forests. Much of the upper watershed is also protected under the Mokelumne Wilderness. The Salt Springs State Game Refuge is located along the Mokelumne River near Salt Springs Reservoir. There are also significant private holdings in the upper basin including commercial timber land and protected watershed areas administered by the East Bay Municipal Utility District, which diverts urban and industrial water from Pardee Reservoir.\n\nThe lower watershed, mainly within San Joaquin and Sacramento Counties, is part of the rich agricultural region of the Central Valley. Grapes are the major crop grown in the Mokelumne River watershed; as of 2001, vineyards comprised 51% of the basin's farmland. Of the remaining land, 31% is used for livestock, 9% for orchards, and 8% for annual crops. About in the lower basin are part of the Mokelumne River AVA.\n\nThe Mokelumne River basin was originally inhabited by Yokuts, Miwok, and Wintun Native American people. The lower (western) basin was the most densely populated, with numerous villages between the fringe of the Sierra foothills and the eastern edge of the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta. This area is believed to have been predominantly Plains Miwok; various subgroups that lived in the Mokelumne River basin included the Mokellos, Lalas, and Machacos. The Miwoks called the river \"Wakalumitch\", possibly meaning \"big river\".\n\nThe first European parties to explore the river were likely Spanish military expeditions in Alta California in the late 18th or early 19th century. The name Mokelumne was first recorded by Spanish missionary Narciso Durán as \"Muquelumnes\" in 1817. However it was not until 1830 when the first permanent European settlement was established on the Mokelumne River, at Happy Valley near present-day Mokelumne Hill, as an outpost for French fur trappers. John C. Frémont is credited with establishing the modern spelling of the name Mokelumne circa 1844. \"Mokelumne\" in the Yokuts language is believed to mean \"Condor River\".\n\nDuring the California Gold Rush, the Mokelumne was a major gold-producing stream. The first person to discover gold in the Mokelumne was likely Charles Weber in 1848. Weber did not stay in the area for long; he moved on to the Coloma diggings on the South Fork American River before establishing a supply center at present-day Stockton, several miles south of the Mokelumne River. Most of the Gold Rush profits and trade on the Mokelumne River would end up passing through Stockton. Also in 1848, Samuel W. Pearsall found gold at Mokelumne Hill, which by 1850 grew into a boomtown of 15,000 people.\n\nThe Mokelumne River is home to five notable whitewater kayaking runs: Fantasy Falls, Devil's Nose, Tiger Creek Dam, Ponderosa and Electra-Middle Bar. Fantasy Falls, a Class V+, 26-mile wilderness reach, runs from below Highway 4 in Alpine County to the backwaters of Salt Springs Reservoir. Devil's Nose, Class IV-V, runs 17 miles from Salt Springs Dams to Tiger Creek Powerhouse. Below Tiger Creek Dam is the Tiger Creek Dam Whitewater run, a scenic, 3 mile Class IV run. The Ponderosa run goes from Ponderosa Way to Electra Powerhouse. The westernmost run is Electra-Middle Bar, a 5+-mile Class II-III run. It begins just below the Electra Powerhouse, passes under Highway 49 south of Jackson, CA and ends at the Middle Bar Bridge.\n\nThe Mokelumne is also a popular site for fishing, camping, water play, birding, picnics, gold panning, spring wildflower watching, and other activities. Electra Road, just east of Highway 49, is a popular place to run, walk, and enjoy the river. The large granite domes, Calaveras Dome and Hammer Dome, near Salt Springs Reservoir, are popular for technical rock climbing. Three campgrounds are also located near Salt Springs: Mokelumne River, White Azalea, and Moore Creek.\n\nAbove Salt Springs Reservoir, the Mokelumne Wilderness challenges those who seek a true wilderness experience. Backpacking in this federally designated wilderness area requires good back-country skills.\n\nDownstream, the river is also a popular recreational destination, particularly the day-use area at the base of the Camanche Dam, which includes the Mokelumne River Fish Hatchery, and Lodi Lake, a city park in the small town of Lodi.\n\nThe California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed a safe eating advisory for Lower Mokelumne River based on levels of mercury or PCBs found in fish caught from this water body.\n\nThe first diversions of the Mokelumne were made during the California Gold Rush in the mid-1850s to provide water for placer and hydraulic mining. The first irrigation scheme was organized by a local collective, the Mokelumne Ditch and Irrigation Company, in 1875, but their dam was demolished by a flood and never rebuilt. The Woodbridge Canal and Irrigation Company was founded in 1891, and was somewhat more successful at tapping Mokelumne River water, but they were still hampered by damaging spring floods and lack of water in the dry season.\n\nIn 1929 the East Bay Municipal Utilities District (EBMUD) built the large Pardee Dam several miles upstream from Lodi and the irrigation diversion points on the Mokelumne River. Pardee is the primary storage facility and diversion point for the Mokelumne Aqueduct, which provides water to 35 municipalities in the eastern San Francisco Bay Area in Alameda and Contra Costa Counties. The first water deliveries to the Bay Area were made on June 23, 1929. The dam can store about which is slightly over one quarter of the Mokelumne's annual flow. Through an agreement between EBMUD and local farmers, Pardee also stabilized the dry season water level in the lower Mokelumne, allowing much greater use of the river for agriculture.\nAs early as 1897, the Mokelumne was utilized for the generation of hydroelectric power at the Blue Lakes powerhouse, near Jackson, to provide power for local communities. Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) began to develop the river for hydroelectricity in the late 1800s. In 1925, the Mokelumne hydroelectric project was licensed, and its major dam, Salt Springs, was completed on the North Fork of the Mokelumne in 1931. The project also includes two dams on the Bear River, the Tiger Creek Dam, and several smaller reservoirs in the Mokelumne headwaters. The project can provide a maximum output of 206 megawatts of electricity from four powerhouses.\n\nIn 1963 Camanche Dam was built directly below Pardee to capture additional Mokelumne River runoff. Its primary purpose is to provide flood control for downstream communities, which allows more water to be retained in Pardee Reservoir for the Bay Area's use. Camanche forms the largest reservoir on the Mokelumne with a capacity of . The dam regulates releases from Pardee for local uses, primarily irrigation, and provides flood control for the lower Mokelumne River. The dam is also operated by EBMUD.\n\nThe Mokelumne River in the Delta forms part of the water pathway for the Central Valley Project and State Water Project, which divert Sacramento River water to a number of aqueducts that supply central and southern California. The Sacramento River is connected to the Mokelumne River by the Delta Cross Channel, which enables the large pump stations near Tracy to draw water south across the Delta via the Mokelumne, San Joaquin, Old River and Middle River.\n\nThe Mokelumne River provides habitat for Pacific salmon and steelhead trout spawning runs. These fish were historically able to migrate upstream of the present site of Pardee Dam, before a natural waterfall prevented further progress. Between 1950 and 1997 the annual fall chinook salmon run has had an estimated average of 3434 fish. The construction of Camanche Dam has blocked access to several miles of the highest quality habitat formerly available to salmonids in the Mokelumne River. To compensate for the lost habitat, the Mokelumne River Fish Hatchery was built in 1964, a year after the completion of Camanche Dam.\n\nThe Lower Mokelumne River is home to at least 35 species of fish. In addition to salmon and trout, common native fish include prickly sculpin (\"Cottus asper\"), and Sacramento sucker (\"Catostomus occidentalis\"). The non-native western mosquitofish (\"Gambusia affinis\"), largemouth bass (\"Micropterus salmoides\") and bluegill (\"Lepomis macrochirus\") are also plentiful.\n\nThe Cosumnes River, the Mokelumne's major tributary, is one of only a few Sierra rivers without large dams; however, irrigation diversions have also caused problems with fish migration on this river.\n\nFor water conservation reasons, local agriculture has switched from flood irrigation to drip and sprinkler systems, and thereby become more reliant on groundwater. This is an issue since the State of California currently does not consider groundwater recharge a beneficial use. North San Joaquin Water Conservation District has the authority to work on this but many other nearby water districts do not.\n\nIn its original 2040 long-range water plan, issued in 2009, the East Bay Municipal Utility District approved an optional expansion of Pardee Reservoir . The expansion would have flooded more than a mile of the river as well as unique cultural and historic sites. A broad coalition of local governments, conservation, recreation and fishery advocates opposed the reservoir expansion. Foothill Conservancy, Friends of the River and California Sportfishing Protection Alliance sued EBMUD in November 2009. In April 2011, Sacramento Superior Court Judge Timothy M. Frawley ruled in the groups' favor and voided the EBMUD plan.\nOn December 5, 2011, East Bay Municipal Utility District announced that the soon-to-be released revised draft environmental impact report for its revised water plan would not recommend the controversial reservoir expansion. On April 24, 2012, the utility's board voted 7-0 to remove the Pardee expansion from its 2040 water plan.\n\nIn 1999, federal and state agencies joined nonprofit organizations and PG&E in signing a settlement agreement for the new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission license of PG&E's hydroelectric project on the Mokelumne, known as Project 137. The agreement requires flows from the hydroelectric project to follow the natural hydrograph of the river, required the removal or dismantling of three small dams on tributary streams, improved recreational flows and facilities on the river, and incorporated an adaptive management plan with a monitoring program. The removal of West Panther Creek Dam in 2003 was the first removal of a PG&E dam in modern history. Since the signing of the settlement and issuance of the FERC license, the signatories have collaboratively managed the project's adaptive management and monitoring program.\n\nAbout 37 miles of the Mokelumne from Salt Springs Powerhouse to just below Highway 49 have been found eligible for National Wild and Scenic River designation by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management as part of those agencies' land management planning responsibilities. In 2014, Sen. Loni Hancock (D-Oakland) introduced Senate Bill 1199 in the California State Senate to designate the river as Wild and Scenic from Salt Springs to Pardee Reservoir. The legislation was co-sponsored by Foothill Conservancy and Friends of the River, and supported by Calaveras County and a number of conservation, fish, community and tribal groups. It was opposed by Amador County and local water agencies. The East Bay Municipal Utility District initially opposed the bill but supported it with proposed author's amendments late in the legislative process. SB 1199 was passed by the Senate but stalled in the State Assembly, where it was held \"in suspense\" by the Appropriations Committee after approval by the Natural Resources Committee.\n\nIn 2015, California Assemblyman Frank Bigelow (R-O'Neals) and Senator Tom Berryhill (R-Twain Harte) co-sponsored state legislation, Assembly Bill 142, which called for completion of a state study before the Mokelumne could be designated a California Wild and Scenic River. After a number of amendments were made to the bill, it was adopted by the Legislature and signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown. The bill mandated a state wild and scenic river suitability study of the Mokelumne and provided interim protections for the river from Salt Springs Dam to Pardee Reservoir. The compromise bill was supported by Sierra foothill water agencies, the East Bay Municipal Utility District and river and fish conservation groups.\n\nIn January 2018, the California Natural Resources Agency released its draft \"Mokelumne River Wild and Scenic River Study\". The study was finalized after extensive, overwhelmingly positive, public comments and with support for final recommendation language from Mokelumne-dependent water agencies, Amador and Calaveras counties, and conservation groups. The final report, issued in April 2018, recommended adding approximately 37 miles of the North Fork and main Mokelumne to the California Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The report's recommendation was incorporated into the natural resources budget trailer bill, Senate Bill 854, which was passed by the state legislature. The bill was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown on June 27, 2018. The enactment of the legislation makes the Mokelumne the 15th river included in the California Wild and Scenic Rivers System. \n\nIn 2014, Foothill Conservancy, other conservation and fish organizations, and federal and state agencies formed a working group to explore restoring salmon and steelhead above Camanche and Pardee reservoirs. The group's work is in progress.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2089573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089573", "title": "Black beret", "text": "Black beret\n\nThe black beret is a type of headgear. It is commonly worn by paramilitaries and militaries around the world, particularly armored forces such as the British Army's Royal Tank Regiment (RTR), the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps (RCAC), and the Royal Australian Armoured Corps (RAAC). Notable non-armored military units to wear the black beret include the Russian Naval Infantry (and formerly Soviet) and Russian OMON units, the United States Air Force (USAF) Tactical Air Control Party (TACP), Philippine National Police-Special Action Force (PNP-SAF) members, and the Royal Canadian Navy (\"navy blue\"). It was also worn by the United Kingdom's Royal Observer Corps (ROC) with their Royal Air Force (RAF) uniform, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA).\n\nBlack berets are also worn by navies. In some navies, the naval color called black is officially \"very dark blue\". The Dutch Navy and Marines wear dark navy blue berets; a silver anchor for the Navy and a gold or dark brown (field duty) anchor on a red background for the Marines. The Portuguese Marines and San Marco Regiment, the Marines of the Italian Navy also wear a dark blue beret. The Royal Norwegian Air Force also use a dark blue beret. Finnish Marine Infantry wear a dark blue beret with the Navy insignia.(Finnish Coastal Jaegers - marine commandos - part of the same Nylands Brigade, wear the green beret).\n\nPerhaps the most famous Commonwealth wearer of the black beret was Field Marshal Montgomery who wore a Royal Tank Regiment (RTR) beret complete with cap badge, presented to him by the regiment, to which he added his own general's (later field marshal's) rank insignia.\n\nThe black beret has its origins with the French 70th Chasseurs Alpins who influenced the British Royal Tank Corps beginning in 1918. General Sir Hugh Jamieson Elles, together with Colonel Fuller came up with the idea of a black beret for the Royal Tank Corps. Black was selected as the colour because it was least likely to show oil stains, something which tank crewmen of that time (and now) could appreciate. It was approved for wear with the Royal Tank Corps by HM King George V on 5 March 1924.\n\nThe black beret remained the exclusive distinctive headdress of the Royal Tank Corps in 1940.\n\nWhen uniforms were issued to the Royal Observer Corps there was a surplus of Royal Armoured Corps black berets that were given to the unit.\n\nThe Argentine Navy's Batallón de Infantería de Marina 5 (5th Marine Battalion), of Falklands War Mount Tumbledown fame (1982), wears a black beret.

In the spring of 1951, the 10th and 11th Ranger Companies wore black berets during their training at Camp Carson, Colorado, before their deployment to Japan.\n\nIn 1979, the black beret was authorized for wear by enlisted personnel in the Tactical Air Control Party. In 1984, two airmen from Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina submitted the current flash and badge design. It was approved for all TACP airmen in 1985. Tactical Air Control Party specialists (AFSC 1C4X1) are currently the only United States Air Force specialty allowed to wear the coveted black beret as part of their daily duty uniform wear.\n\nTactical Air Control Party members of the United States Air Force wear black berets with a flash and badge design.\n\nIn 1973, permission was granted to local commanders to encourage distinctive, morale-enhancing uniform items and the black beret was adopted by armor and armored cavalry units in the United States.\nA black beret was authorized for wear by female soldiers in 1975.\n\nOn January 30, 1975, it was officially assigned as part of the newly created battalions of United States Army Rangers who had worn it unofficially during the Vietnam War.\n\nIn 1979, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff ruled that the black beret was restricted to just ranger and airborne units (the latter receiving their distinctive maroon berets on November 28, 1980). However, since June 14, 2001, the black beret is worn by all United States Army troops unless the soldier is approved to wear a different distinctive beret. The Rangers now wear tan berets in reverence to the buckskins worn by Rogers' Rangers during the French and Indian War.\n\nThe black beret is worn as part of the Army Service Uniform (ASU), the U.S. Army's dress uniform. It also became the official garrison headgear to be worn with the Battle Dress Uniform (BDUs) in 2001, and from 2005 the Army Combat Uniform (ACU). The change was implemented by General Eric Shinseki, the Army Chief of Staff at the time, who stated that it was about promoting \"...our values as an institution.\" From the beginning, the beret was unpopular with soldiers, because the headgear required two hands to put it on, could not be carried in the pocket when not worn (as the patrol cap could), and provided no shade from the sun (again unlike the patrol cap).\n\nDespite years of negative feedback, the beret remained part of the ACU until 2011, when incoming Sergeant Major of the Army Raymond F. Chandler made it his first order of business to address the wishes \"thousands of soldiers\" who wanted the army to end the wear of the beret with the ACU, and the army subsequently did just that. The black beret remained the headgear for the ASU, but was replaced as the default headgear with the ACU patrol cap.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War the U.S. Navy personnel assigned to patrol boats wore the South Vietnamese navy black beret with badge. Unit tradition had the back ribbon cut into two pennants after first contact with the enemy with the ends of the pennant notched in a \"V\" to signify he had made an enemy \"kill\". \n\nUntil October 2016, a black beret was authorized to be worn in the U.S. Navy, albeit solely by female sailors of all pay-grades. Female commissioned officers wore the U.S. Navy officer crest on the beret above the left eyebrow, female petty officers and seamen wore the combination cover's device, and female chief petty officers wore their rate insignia instead. The female black beret's usage was discontinued along with the officer's tiara by the navy in 2016 as part of a naval effort to reduce the number of uniform items, make them appear more unisex, and also due to a lack of widespread use.\n\nIn the Venezuelan Army, black berets are of general use except for Paratroopers, Special Forces, Counter-insurgency troops and soldiers stationed inside the Ministry of Defence and Army headquarters.\n\n"}

{"id": "2089592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089592", "title": "Lost, mislaid, and abandoned property", "text": "Lost, mislaid, and abandoned property\n\nLost, mislaid, and abandoned property are categories of the common law of property which deals with personal property or chattel which has left the possession of its rightful owner without having directly entered the possession of another person. Property can be considered lost, mislaid or abandoned depending on the circumstances under which it is found by the next party who obtains its possession.\n\nThere is an old saying that \"possession is nine-tenths of the law\", perhaps dating back centuries. This means that in most cases, the possessor of a piece of property is its rightful owner without evidence to the contrary. More colloquially, this may be called finders, keepers. The contradiction to this principle is theft by finding, which may occur if conversion occurs after finding someone else's property.\n\nThe rights of a finder of such property are determined in part by the status in which it is found. Because these classifications have developed under the common law of England, they turn on nuanced distinctions. The general rule attaching to the three types of property may be summarized as: \"A finder of property acquires no rights in mislaid property, is entitled to possession of lost property against everyone except the true owner, and is entitled to keep abandoned property.\" This rule varies by jurisdiction.\n\nProperty is generally deemed to have been lost if it is found in a place where the true owner likely did not intend to set it down, and where it is not likely to be found by the true owner. At common law, the finder of a lost item could claim the right to possess the item against any person except the true owner or any previous possessors.\n\nThe underlying policy goals to these distinctions are to (hopefully) see that the property is returned to its true original owner, or \"title owner.\" Most jurisdictions have now enacted statutes requiring that the finder of lost property turn it in to the proper authorities; if the true owner does not arrive to claim the property within a certain period of time (this is defined by the Torts Act 1977 as 3 months from the date of finding), the property is returned to the finder as his own, or is disposed of. In Britain, many public businesses have a dedicated Lost Property Office (LPO), which in the United States would be called a lost and found, where lost property can be reported and reclaimed free of charge.\n\nMany exceptions may be applied at common law to the rule that the first finder of lost property has a superior claim of right over any other person except the previous owner. For example, a trespasser's claim to lost property which he finds while trespassing is generally inferior to the claim of the respective landowner. As a corollary to this exception, a landowner has superior claim over a find made within the non-public areas of his property, so if a customer finds lost property in the public area of a store, the customer has superior claim to the lost property over that of the store-owner, but if the customer finds the lost property in the non-public area of that store, such as an area marked \"Employees Only,\" the store-owner will have superior claim, as the customer was trespassing when he found it.\n\nThe status of finders as employees or tenants of the landowner complicates matters, because employees and tenants have legitimate access to non-public areas of a landowner's property that others would not, without trespassing. Employees and tenants, however, still usually lose superior claim over lost property to their employers or landlords if the property is found within the scope of their employment, or outside the actual leased area, respectively. \n\nFor example, if the lost property is found by a tenant inside the walls of his leasehold, or by an employee embedded within the soil of an estate owned by his employer, the landowner (as employer or landlord) of the property where it was found usually has a superior claim of right over that of the finder. However, this is not always the case, as a long-term tenant who finds lost property within the leased area of his leasehold may have a superior claim over that of his landlord (especially if the landlord has never been to the property). While employers usually have a superior claim over lost property found by their employees, exceptions to this exist as well, as modern law sometimes grants the employee superior claim if turning over lost property to his employer is not part of his job description (such as if the employee is an interior decorator).\n\nSince animals are mobile and are thus capable of becoming lost on their own, the loss of property that is a valuable animal has its own set of rules. A valuable animal that becomes lost usually does so by leaving its owner's real property and arriving on another property owner's land; such an animal is legally termed an estray. Estrays are normally confined to domesticated animals, like livestock, and not wild animals. Since common pets are not considered valuable animals, dogs and cats are never considered estrays.\n\nIn many jurisdictions of the U.S., a person who discovers an estray will be required to file an affidavit of estray, along with its description, and potentially impound that animal in some way for a period of time. If the estray is branded, the owner can often be identified immediately. The owner of the estray will generally have a limited time frame in which to reclaim his property after a notice of estray is published, but on the expiration of such time another person or entity will be designated the new title owner of the property. Fees for impounding the estray will often accumulate which the property owner will be responsible for paying.\n\nThe status of a stray domestic animal (for example, a feral cat or a free-ranging dog) is highly dependent on local jurisdictions. Given the significant number of feral dogs and cats, the finder of a lost dog or cat may have little or no restrictions to claiming the animal as his own property.\n\nLike animals, fugitive slaves in the United States (runaway slaves) were a type of property that was capable of relocating to other places. Slave owners depended on others to identify and return their property; some slaves would be branded if a slave was known to run away. Numerous laws in the U.S., like the Fugitive Slave Clause of the Constitution of 1789, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, and the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 all stipulated that the slaves be captured and returned to their owner. These laws, now superseded by Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of 1865, were demanded by the Southern States of the U.S. but were actively opposed in most Northern states. Activists against slavery and the fugitive slave laws, such as members of the Underground Railroad, routinely violated the laws and refused to return slaves to their owners.\n\nOf the 5 laws agreed upon in the Compromise of 1850, the fugitive slave laws were by far the most contentious, although many of the issues were split along regional lines with Northerners and Southerners diametrically opposed. In Harriet Beecher Stowe's 1852 novel \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", the issue of runaway slaves was a central theme. These property and fugitive slave issues, along with other events related to slavery, would propel the U.S. into civil war.\n\nUnclaimed property laws in the United States provide for two reporting periods each year whereby unclaimed bank accounts, stocks, insurance proceeds, utility deposits, un-cashed checks and other forms of \"personal property\" are reported first to the individual state's Unclaimed Property Office, then published in a local newspaper and then finally the property is turned over to the State for safe keeping until its rightful owner makes a claim. The states sponsor a free public site that reports only a portion of the unclaimed property available in the United States. There are commercial sites as well that provide the same information or portions of the information for a fee. Some consumer reporting sites that conduct the research and assist consumers will do so without charge or expense to the consumers.\n\nIn Australia, unclaimed money laws provide a one to two year reporting period each year whereby unclaimed bank accounts, superannuation, deceased estate inheritances, insurance, shares, dividends, utility deposits, unpresented cheques and other forms of \"unclaimed money\" are reported to the appropriate governing body under which the organisation holding the money falls under. This can include states in Australia or the Commonwealth. Money is unclaimed money if it is money whose owners is not identifiable.\n\nOwners of unclaimed money can apply to the governing body where the unclaimed money is being held, however, in some cases, the owner is required to go back to the organisation who lodged the money as unclaimed. Unclaimed Money Professionals or Unclaimed Money Agents also can assist owners to claim back their unclaimed money. Due to the strict requirements to claim unclaimed money back in Australia, people may need the assistance of a professional or licensed private investigator to locate support documents for their claim of payment.\n\nProperty is generally deemed to have been mislaid or misplaced if it is found in a place where the true owner likely \"did\" intend to set it, but then simply forgot to pick it up again. For example, a wallet found in a shop lying on a counter near a cash register will likely be deemed \"misplaced\" rather than \"lost\". Under common law principles, the finder of a misplaced object has a duty to turn it over to the owner of the premises, on the theory that the true owner is likely to return to that location to search for his misplaced item. If the true owner does not return within a reasonable time (which varies considerably depending on the circumstances), the property becomes that of the owner of the premises.\n\nProperty is generally deemed to have been abandoned if it is found in a place where the true owner likely intended to leave it, but is in such a condition that it is apparent that he or she has no intention of returning to claim it. Abandoned property generally becomes the property of whoever should find it and take possession of it first, although some states have enacted statutes under which certain kinds of abandoned propertyusually cars, wrecked ships and wrecked aircraftescheat, meaning that they become the property of the state.\n\nIn the United States, property left behind by a tenant is generally presumed abandoned after anywhere from 1 week to 1 year, and if unclaimed, may be disposed of or sold to recoup storage costs; in some states the difference may be kept by the landlord, in others returned to the tenant, and in others it must be turned over to the state or county. Virginia requires only 24 hour storage for evictions. Maryland allows individual counties to set required storage times. Colorado allows immediate disposal (but not sale), while Georgia and Texas allow it to be immediately placed outside and claimed by anyone, and Arkansas allows the landlord to immediately claim the property for themselves to do as they wish.\n\nTreasure trove is property that consists of coins or currency hidden by the owner. To be considered \"treasure trove\" and not \"mislaid property\", the property must have been deliberately hidden or concealed, and sufficiently long ago that the original owner can be considered dead or not discoverable. For example, under historic English law, one hundred Roman coins found buried in a pot would have been treasure trove whilst one hundred Roman coins which were lost over time in a marketplace would not have been treasure trove, as they were not deliberately hidden as a single hoard. However, the law of treasure trove has now been replaced by the Treasure Act under which this distinction between lost and deposited items does not generally apply.\n\nUnder American common law, treasure trove belongs to the finder unless the original owner reclaims. Some states have rejected the American common law and hold that treasure trove belongs to the owner of the property in which the treasure trove was found. These courts reason that the American common law rule encourages trespass.\n\nUnder the traditional English common law, treasure trove belongs to the Crown, though the finder may be paid a reward.\n\nIn the United States, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws sought to address the problems arising from these types of property through provisions of the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act. The act was first drafted and promulgated in 1981 and a revised version, the Revised Uniform Unclaimed Property Act was introduced in 1995. The act specifically focuses on the problem of unclaimed money in bank accounts and corporate coffers, and the corresponding escheatment.\n\nAs a result of the Act, each state that has adopted the act operates an Unclaimed Property fund in which the proceeds from abandoned bank accounts, unpresented checks, etc. are to be turned over to the state after a specified period of time. Depending on state law, the money may be held either in perpetuity (i.e., the funds \"never\" escheat to the state; an example would be Texas), or after a long period of time (whereby it is presumed that the owner is deceased with no heirs) the funds will escheat to the state. Due to the increasing mobility of the population, 39 states have joined together to operate MissingMoney.com, a searchable database which lists unclaimed funds in these states. Another website at Unclaimed.org allows searches without charge for the remaining 11 states. Many commercial websites also offer this service at a charge. A searchable database for unclaimed money and property is available in Canada from the Bank of Canada.\n\nA similar problem has developed with respect to orphan works, artistic or literary works for which a copyright is in effect, but for whom the copyright owner cannot be found.\n\n\n"}

The theme park is divided into four sections that celebrate Christmas, Halloween, Thanksgiving and the Fourth of July with rides, live entertainment, games, and attractions.\n\nHoliday World contains three wooden roller coasters: The Raven, The Legend, and The Voyage, as well as Thunderbird (a Bolliger & Mabillard launched Wing Coaster) and The Howler. The safari-themed water park includes the world's two longest water coasters: Wildebeest and Guinness World Record Holder Mammoth, numerous family raft rides and water slides, two wave pools, junior-sized wave pool, two children's-sized water slide areas, a lazy river, two family \"tipping bucket\".\n\nPlans for Santa Claus Land were first conceived as a retirement project by Louis J. Koch, a retired industrialist from Evansville, Indiana. In 1941, Koch visited the town of Santa Claus, Indiana. A family man and father of nine children, it bothered him that children traveled to the town only to be disappointed when they discovered Santa Claus was not there. In response, Koch developed the idea for a park where children could have fun and visit Santa year-round. Although initial construction plans were delayed by World War II, construction of Santa Claus Land eventually began on August 4, 1945. At this time, Indiana had only one amusement park which was Indiana Beach (at the time called Ideal Beach) that had opened in 1926, 20 years before Santa Claus Land opened.\n\nSanta Claus Land opened on August 3, 1946. At no cost, the park offered a Santa, a toy shop, toy displays, a restaurant and themed children's rides, one of which was The Freedom Train. After overcoming doubts about the park's ability for success, Louis Koch's son, William A. \"Bill\" Koch, Sr., took over as head of Santa Claus Land. In the following years, Bill Koch continued to add to the park, including the first Jeep-Go-Round ever manufactured, a new restaurant and a deer farm which was eventually home to fourteen European white fallow deer.\n\nBeginning in 1955, Santa Claus Land charged admission for the first time; adults were charged 50 cents while children continued to be admitted for free. Despite the new cost of admission, attendance continued to grow with the park. The Pleasureland ride section, which exists today as Rudolph's Reindeer Ranch, debuted in 1955. In the early 1970s, additional children's rides, including Dasher's Seahorses, Comet's Rockets, Blitzen's Airplanes, and Prancer's Merry-Go-Round, were added to this section. From 1959 to 1961, the first live entertainment, the Willie Bartley Water Ski Thrill Show, performed on Lake Rudolph each summer. A Santa Claus Choir composed of local children also performed at the park in 1970 and 1971.\n\nIn 1960, Bill Koch married Patricia \"Pat\" Yellig, the daughter of Jim Yellig, the park's Santa Claus. Bill and Pat Koch would have five children: Will, Kristi, Daniel, Philip, and Natalie.\n\nIn 1976, Santa Claus Land shifted its focus, along with its entrance, which was moved from State Road 162 to its present location on State Road 245. The park began to focus on the entire family, rather than just children. The park added nine new rides by 1984, eight of which they hoped would appeal to older children and adults alike. Eagle's Flight, Rough Riders, Roundhouse, Virginia Reel, Scarecrow Scrambler, Lewis & Clark Trail, Paul Revere's Midnight Ride and Thunder Bumpers on Chesapeake Bay were all targeted towards families, while Dancer's Thunder Bumpers Junior was built for children who weren't quite ready for the larger version of the ride.\n\nBy 1984, the Koch Family had realized the theming possibilities beyond Christmas. Santa Claus Land soon saw the first major expansion in park history with the addition of a Halloween section and a Fourth of July section. With the inclusion of more than just Christmas, Santa Claus Land formally changed its name to Holiday World. In the following years, Frightful Falls and Banshee were added to the Halloween section, Raging Rapids was added to the Fourth of July section in 1990, and Kringle's Kafé restaurant was built in the Christmas section.\n\nIt was also during this time period that Holiday World saw a change in leadership. Will Koch, the eldest of Bill Koch's children, took over as President of the park. Another of Bill Koch's children, Daniel \"Dan\" Koch, became chairman of the board.\n\nThe addition of Splashin' Safari in 1993 welcomed a new era for the theme park. In its first year of operation, Splashin' Safari operated with Congo River, Crocodile Isle, AmaZOOM and Bamboo Chute. The Wave was added the following year.\n\nThe park added the first of its three wooden roller coasters in 1995 with The Raven, built by Custom Coasters International. The Raven was named \"Ride of the Year\" and was voted as the world's second best wooden roller coaster. In 2000, The Raven was ranked as the #1 wooden roller coaster in the world by Amusement Today magazine. It held the top spot for a total of four years. As of the 2011 awards, The Raven has remained ranked among the top twenty wooden roller coasters in the world.\n\nOver the next four years, the park made only two additions. The first was the addition of Monsoon Lagoon in Splashin' Safari. The second was the replacement of Firecracker with Holidog's FunTown, a children's play area featuring Holidog's Treehouse, The Howler, Doggone Trail and Magic Waters.\n\nIn 2000, Custom Coasters International added another wooden roller coaster. The Legend, based on Washington Irving's \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\", was opened immediately adjacent to The Raven and is taller, longer, and faster than The Raven. The Legend's ranking reached its peak in 2002, when it was voted the fourth best wooden roller coaster in the world. Much like The Raven, The Legend continues to be ranked among the top twenty wooden roller coasters in the world, as of the 2011 awards. In 2000, the park also began offering its guests free unlimited soft drinks, a service which brought international attention to the park. Holiday World was the first park in the world to offer this service to its guests.\n\nFor the next five years, the park's additions grew steadily. In 2002, ZOOMbabwe, the world's largest enclosed water slide, was added to Splashin' Safari. In 2003, Splashin' Safari added Zinga on top of The Legend's spiral drop, a ProSlide Tornado, while Holiday World replaced Banshee with Hallowswings and the Hall of Famous Americans wax museum with Liberty Launch. In 2004, the park continued to add onto the water park, adding Jungle Racer and Jungle Jets. Bahari Wave Pool was added in 2005, which marked the beginning of an expansion project that would double the size of Splashin' Safari.\n\nHoliday World & Splashin' Safari received its most sought after award in 2004, when it earned the Applause Award from the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions. To win the award, awarded every two years, a park must show \"foresight, originality and creativity, plus sound business development and profitability.\" With an attendance of 883,000 that year, Holiday World was the smallest park to ever receive the award.\n\nThe 2006 season marked the 60th anniversary of Holiday World. The park marked it by adding a brand new section: Thanksgiving. To complement the section, the park added two new rides. The first was Gobbler Getaway, a Sally Corporation interactive dark ride. The anchor attraction was the park's third wooden roller coaster, The Voyage, built by The Gravity Group, successors of Custom Coasters International. The addition of The Voyage gained the park national attention once again, as the roller coaster claimed the record for most air-time of any wooden roller coaster at 24.2 seconds. It is also the second longest wooden roller coaster in the world behind only The Beast at Kings Island. In its first year of operation, The Voyage was awarded the title of \"Best New Ride\" and #2 wooden roller coaster in the world. From 2007 to 2011, The Voyage was awarded the title of #1 wooden roller coaster in the world by the readers of Amusement Today magazine. Also added in 2006 was Bahari River in Splashin' Safari. It was named the \"Best New Waterpark Ride\" by Amusement Today magazine.\n\nOver the next three years, Holiday World & Splashin' Safari opened several new additions. Bakuli and Kima Bay were added to Splashin' Safari, Turkey Whirl and Plymouth Rock Café were added to the Thanksgiving section, the Star Spangled Carousel replaced Thunder Bumpers on Chesapeake Bay in the Fourth of July section, and Reindeer Games replaced Kids Castle in the Christmas section. In 2009, Holiday World continued to break records by opening the world's tallest water ride, Pilgrims Plunge, in the Thanksgiving section of the park. Pilgrims Plunge deviated from the standard of using a sloped lift hill, instead opting for an open-air elevator system that takes riders to a height of before dropping them at a forty-five degree angle. Pilgrims Plunge was renamed to Giraffica in 2013 when the boundaries between the Thanksgiving section and the water park were slightly altered.\n\nSplashin' Safari broke another record in 2010, when Wildebeest was opened. When Wildebeest opened, it was the world's longest water coaster at long. It was also among the first water coasters to use linear induction motors, rather than water jets or conveyor belts, to propel riders up hills. Wildebeest was named \"Best New Waterpark Ride\" in 2010, as well as \"Best Waterpark Ride\" in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The park broke its own record just two years later, in 2012, when Mammoth opened. Mammoth, which was the most expensive ride added to the park until the addition of Thunderbird, is long, making it the longest water coaster in the world.\n\nIn February 2010, Holiday World's rival park, Kentucky Kingdom in Louisville, Kentucky, announced that it would be closing permanently and ending operations after park operator Six Flags could not reach a lease agreement for the property. Several members of the Koch family later expressed interest into reviving the park in 2012, but later backed out of the deal. This park would eventually reopen under different management in 2014.\n\nThe park suffered a sudden loss in June 2010 when President and CEO Will Koch died while swimming at his home. Although the Spencer County coroner listed the official cause of death as drowning, family and park officials believe Koch's type 1 diabetes played a factor in his death. Soon after his death, Holiday World & Splashin' Safari named Will's younger brother Dan as the park's new President. Dan Koch served as the park's President until late 2012, shortly after which the board of directors announced Matt Eckert as the new President, launching a bitter fight within the family for control of the park and its assets. Matt Eckert was previously one of the parks two general managers. Eckert is the first park President not related to the Koch family. They also ousted Pat Koch, Will Sr.'s widow, from any involvement the park. She had been a fixture there for decades.\n\nWill Koch's widow Lori and their three children won primary ownership in the park after an ugly court battle and its parent company, Koch Development Corporation. Dan Koch, along with his sister Natalie, would go on in 2014 to form Koch Family Parks and buy Alabama Splash Adventure, a previously troubled theme park in Bessemer, Alabama.\n\nIn recent years, the park has replaced some of its older rides with newer rides. In Holiday World, Blitzen's Airplanes was replaced with Rudolph's Round-Up in 2011 and in 2012 Paul Revere's Midnight Ride was replaced with Sparkler, a tall Zamperla Vertical Swing ride. Due to limited vertical clearance for Sparkler, the park decided to relocate Star Spangled Carousel to the former location of Paul Revere's Midnight Ride and to place Sparkler in the carousel's place. The following year, Holiday World removed part of Holidog's Treehouse to make room for a new tea cup ride called Kitty's Tea Party. In 2013, the park also removed the only original remaining ride, The Freedom Train, citing maintenance concerns; it was replaced by another train ride which the park named Holidog Express. In Splashin' Safari, Jungle Jets was replaced with Safari Sam's SplashLand in 2011. In 2013, AmaZOOM, Bamboo Chute, Congo River, and Crocodile Isle were removed to make room for a new Splashin' Safari entry plaza; in its place, Hyena Falls and Hyena Springs were added to the north of Giraffica.\n\nOn September 6, 2013, Holiday World announced plans for a 2014 expansion totaling $8 million. The highlight of the announcement was a new swinging ship ride called the Mayflower, which is located in the park's Thanksgiving section just to the north of Gobbler Getaway. This ride is the first of a series of rides intended to bring the focus back on the theme park after several years of major additions to the water park. Mayflower has a capacity of 60 riders and swings 54 feet over a pool of water. In addition to Mayflower, the park announced a new restaurant and shop in Splashin' Safari, more cabanas, additional benches and shade structures, parking lot improvements, and the addition of fireworks on Friday nights between June 13 and August 1.\n\nGiraffica closed at the end of the 2013 season and was removed before the start of the 2014 season citing technical problems.\n\nOn July 24, 2014, the park announced the construction of Thunderbird, a launched Bolliger & Mabillard Wing Coaster, for the 2015 season, occupying the area north of Hyena Falls and intertwining with The Voyage. This is B&M's first launched coaster (The Incredible Hulk Coaster at Universal's Islands of Adventure's launch was created by Universal, not B&M). The coaster reaches speeds up to in 3.5 seconds and the tallest vertical loop on a Wing Coaster. It is also the park's first major steel roller coaster, as The Raven, The Legend, and The Voyage are all wooden.\n\nHoliday World is divided into four holiday-themed sections: Christmas, Halloween, Fourth of July and Thanksgiving. Each of the sections features rides, games, food and other attractions that follow the theme of that section's respective holiday. The music that plays over the loud speakers in each section is also themed to that section's respective holiday; guests will often notice the music change as they enter a different section. Splashin' Safari, which is connected to the theme park via entrances in the Halloween and Thanksgiving sections, takes the general theme of a safari.\n\nUpon entering Holiday World, guests immediately enter the Christmas section. The Christmas section is the oldest section of Holiday World, dating back to 1946. It was also the only themed area of the park until 1984. Although devoid of any major rides, there is a small sub-section called Rudolph's Reindeer Ranch which is home to several small children's rides. Notable landmarks in this section include a Santa Claus statue, a Christmas tree, a nativity scene and the Applause fountain, which was added after the park was awarded the IAAPA Applause Award in 2004. The Christmas section of the park also includes one of the park's two air-conditioned restaurants: Kringle's Kafé, which serves standard theme park fare such as pizza, burgers and ice cream. Since the park's opening in 1946, Santa Claus has been available daily throughout the season to chat with children.\n\nThe Halloween section was one of two new holidays added in 1984. Two of the three wooden roller coasters in the park are located here: The Raven and The Legend. The area also has a Goblin Burgers restaurant, which resembles a witch's house, the Frightful Falls log flume that intertwines with The Legend, and the main entrance to Splashin' Safari water park. Apart from the architecture, guests will hear the school bell from The Legend's station ringing ominously throughout the section. It introduced Kitty Claws as its mascot in 2012.\n\nThe Fourth of July section was the second of the two holidays that were added in 1984. It introduced George the Eagle as its mascot. This area features more attractions than any of the four sections in the theme park. Landmarks in this section include the Hoosier Celebration Theater, where many live shows are performed; the Good Old Days Picnic Grove, where numerous shelter houses may be rented out for company picnics; and The Alamo restaurant, which serves traditional Mexican food. The Fourth of July section is also home to a sub-section called Holidog's FunTown, a children's play area which is completely encircled by Holidog Express. Keeping with the Fourth of July theme, there is also a monument with several American flags located right across from The Alamo restaurant in the center of the section.\n\nThe Thanksgiving section is the newest section of the park, added in 2006 to commemorate Holiday World's 60th anniversary. The anchor attraction of this section is The Voyage which wraps around parts of the midway; guests walk under The Voyage 's brake run upon entering the section through Fourth of July. In the back of the Thanksgiving section is Thunderbird, the wing coaster, and a secondary entrance to Splashin' Safari. In addition to The Voyage and Thunderbird, the Thanksgiving section includes the second of the park's two air-conditioned restaurants: Plymouth Rock Café, which serves typical Thanksgiving food such as turkey, prime rib, stuffing, green beans and bread rolls. Turkeys can often be heard \"gobbling\" throughout the section as sounds emanate from the Gobbler Getaway ride and Pilgrims' Challenge game.\n\nSplashin' Safari, the water park Holiday World added in 1993, has consistently ranked among the best water parks in the United States, even being named as the #1 water park in the United States by TripAdvisor in 2011. The water park takes the general theme of a safari, with ride names featuring various animals, rivers and Swahili words. Holiday World has added onto its water park every year from 2002 to 2013. Among those additions are the world's two longest water coasters: Wildebeest and Mammoth, which are also, respectively, the third and first most expensive additions ever made to the park. Unlike a number of other theme parks that necessitate a separate admission fee for the water park, entry to Splashin' Safari is included with admission to Holiday World.\n\nRather than sign licensed characters for the park, Holiday World has developed several mascots and characters including:\n\nHoliday World & Splashin' Safari offers a variety of live entertainment, including singing, dancing and diving. All shows are performed at least six days per week when the park is in daily operation.\n\n\nIn 2004, Holiday World & Splashin' Safari was presented the Applause Award. To receive this honor, a park must show \"foresight, originality and creativity, plus sound business development and profitability.\" With an attendance of 883,000 that year, Holiday World was the smallest park to ever receive the award. The park celebrated by installing a large replica of the award's trophy as well as commemorative plaques naming other recipients of the award as part of a fountain in the Christmas section.\n\nHoliday World & Splashin' Safari has also received numerous Golden Ticket Awards, which are presented by Amusement Today magazine to the best of the best in the amusement park industry. At 51, Holiday World has received more Golden Ticket Awards than any other amusement park in the world, as of 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was the follow-up to the band's triple-platinum \"God Shuffled His Feet\". By February 1999, \"A Worm's Life\" had sold more than 1 million copies worldwide.\n\nAfter the band finished touring their hit album \"God Shuffled His Feet\", frontman Brad Roberts spent considerable time traveling abroad, relocating to London, England at the time to escape the pressures of fame and celebrity where, because they didn't get MTV Europe, no one recognized him there \"except German and Italian tourists.\" \n\nDuring his travels, Roberts began penning new material. Though he briefly visited New York City, most of the material he had written was outside North America, including one notable stay in Prague, Czech Republic. Finally, after having compiled much written material, Roberts reconvened with the rest of the band at Compass Point Studios in The Bahamas in the winter of 1995 to begin recording the follow-up to \"God Shuffled His Feet\".\n\nAs a departure from the recording sessions of their first two records, the band decided to self-produce \"A Worm's Life\". Pursuing a more guitar-heavy sound, the band drafted acclaimed music producer and recording engineer Terry Manning to engineer the record. The band's producer, Jeff Rogers, noted: \"Terry has got a guitar collection to rival Randy Bachman's. And Brad got to play every one of them on the record.\"\n\nRoberts had claimed on record that \"A Worm's Life\" \"does go a little further than the other ones in terms of odd melodies, wacky key signatures, and chord changes.\" while continuing to adopt a lyrical approach that looks \"at simple things in unusual ways rather than the other way around.\" \n\nThe album was originally planned for release on August 28, 1996. However, the release date would later be moved back to October 2, 1996, with BMG Canada citing the need for \"more set-up time\".\n\nOriginally \"Overachievers\" was planned as the album's lead single (then titled \"The Over-Achievers\"), with the band's producer Jeff Rogers even noting at the time that the band had contacted three different directors for music video concepts to complement that track's release. However, \"He Liked to Feel It\" would later replace \"Overachievers\" as the lead single as the album's release date drew closer.\n\n\"He Liked to Feel It\" proved to be a hit in the band's native Canada, becoming their highest-peaking career single at #2 on the Canadian singles chart. Despite the single's success domestically, \"He Liked to Feel It\" made minimal chart impact abroad, perhaps due to controversy surrounding the track's music video hindering its promotional efforts. A second single, \"My Own Sunrise\", would follow in January 1997, becoming a minor hit for the band, with \"My Enemies\" following as the album's third and final single later that year, also making limited impact.\n\n\"A Worm's Life\" enjoyed strong initial sales in Canada; achieving a platinum certification less than one month after its release date. However, the album sold disappointingly elsewhere, and would have a considerably shorter chart life compared to its predecessor \"God Shuffled His Feet\" in Canada.\n\n\nThe album generally received mixed to poor reviews. Allmusic writer Darryl Cater gave the album 2 out of 5 stars and states that the album \"finds singer-songwriter Brad Roberts rummaging through his repetroire in a futile search for a new idea. His glossy pop hooks seem to run over and over again into tunes he's already written. When Roberts isn't doing that routine, he's trying in vain to fit wordy lyrics into memorable melodies. The uninspired guitar-driven production (which has now left the band's folk roots behind altogether) doesn't help matters.\"\n"}

Brittany, Limousin, Gascony, Corsica and Auvergne were among the regions that experienced a notable resurgence in the popularity of folk music. Traditional styles of music had survived most in remote areas, such as the island of Corsica and mountainous Auvergne, as well as the more nationalist lands of the Basques and Bretons.\n\nIn many cases, folk traditions were revived in relatively recent years to cater to tourists. These \"groupes folkloriques\" tend to focus on very early 20th century melodies and the use of the piano accordion.\n\nFolk music and dance now has an established place as a popular pastime in its own right with innumerable festivals, concerts and bals folks across France and a number of regular publications devoted to it.\n\nAuvergne is known for cabrette bagpipes. The cabrette (\"little goat\" in Auvergnat) is a bagpipe made of goatskin (goats being an integral part of Auvergnat traditional life) and without drones, blown by elbow-driven bellows. Some famous old players : Martin Cayla, Jean Bergheaud, Marcel Bernard, Antoine Bouscatel, Joseph Costeroste, Georges Soule, and some modern players: Dominique Paris, Victor Laroussinie, Didier Pauvert, Stéphane Charpentier, Michel Esbelin, François Lazarevic. They play both regrets (\"slow airs\"), bourrées (\"typical auvergne danse\") and swift, 3/8 dance music.\n\nJoseph Canteloube was a well-known composer from Auvergne in the early 20th century, and produced a famous collection of folk music called \"Songs of the Auvergne\".\n\nBéarn's revivalist scene has been quite limited in scope, though it has produced the nationally renowned singer Marilis Orionaa. Traditional instruments from the area include the tambour de Béarn, a six-string drum used as a rhythm drone instrument to accompany the three-holed recorder.\n\nOne of the biggest stars of the French roots revival was Perlinpinpin Folc, formed in 1972 and led by Christian Lanau, whose \"Musique Traditionelle de Gascogne\" was a popular release that sparked interest in the traditional music of Gascony.\n\nGascon small pipes, called boha (\"bouhe\"), are a well-known part of the local scene. They have a rectangular chanter and drone combination, which is unique to Gascony, and are made out of sheepskin with the fleece showing.\n\nLanguedoc is home to several unusual instruments, including the bodega, a kind of bagpipe, and the \"aboès\" and \"graille\", both kinds of oboes. The bodega is made out of goatskin, using an unusual process in which the innards of the animal are removed through the neck so that the entire, unbroken skin can be used for the instrument. It has only one large shoulder drone. The bodega is known from at least the 14th century. Popular traditional groups from Languedoc include Calabrun, Trencavel, Laurent Audemard's Une Anche Passe and Trioc.\n\nLimousin is known for its violin music, as well as the chabrette bagpipe. Eric Montbel is the biggest star of Limousin folk, while Françoise Etay, Jean Pierre Champeval, Olivier Durif, Valentin Clastrier and Pascal Lefeuvre are also popular. Instruments include the cabrette bagpipe and the ancient army fife, \"pifre\". Limousin violin music, focussed in Corrèze, has produced stars François Etay and Trio Violon, while more modern fiddlers include François Breugnot, Olivier Durif, Jean Pierre Champeval and Jean-François Vrod. The hurdy-gurdy in Limousin has been extended to avant-garde styles utilizing electronic music, jazz and other influences, including Pascal Lefeuvre, Dominique Regef and Valentin Clastrier.\n\nThe most iconic form of Provençal folk music is a duo of fife and drum, or ensembles of \"galoubets-tambourins\"; the most prominent characteristic of the region's folk music, however, is the Italian musical influence. Performers include Patrice Cornte, Yves Rousguisto and André Gabriel. Provence's diverse communities include Savoie, whose distinct hurdy gurdy tradition has produced the modern band La Kinkerne, the Alpes Maritimes choral tradition, which includes choirs like La Compagnie Vocale and Corous de Berra, and the northern region, which has produced a vibrant violin tradition, Dauphiné's rigaudon dance and performers Rigodon Sauvage, Patrick Mazellier and Drailles. Dauphiné also features one of the rare sword dances that have stood the test of time, the Bacchu-ber performed yearly in Briançon.\n\nThe southwestern region of Roussillon's music is shaped by its unique ethnicities, and includes forms of Catalan and Gypsy music. The former includes the sardana and is based around the city of Perpignan. The sardana is played by a band (\"coble\") consisting of three kinds of oboes, flutes and other instrument, including shawms and bagpipes among some recent revivalists. Modern traditional performers include Cobla Mil-Lenaria, La Cobla de Joglars, Els Ministrles del Rossellano and La Colba els Montgrins.\n"}

Newton, Chairman of the Black Panther Party, in 1978 when Newton applied while in prison to do a reading course with Trivers as part of a graduate degree in History of Consciousness at UC Santa Cruz. Trivers and Newton became close friends: Newton was godfather to one of Trivers's daughters. Trivers joined the Black Panther Party in 1979. Trivers and Newton published an analysis of the role of self-deception by the flight crew in the crash of Air Florida Flight 90. Trivers was \"ex-communicated\" from the Panthers by Newton in 1982 for \"his own good.\"\n\nTrivers wrote the original foreword to Richard Dawkins' book \"The Selfish Gene\", in which Trivers first proposed his adaptive theory of self-deception.\n\nIn 2015, Rutgers University suspended Trivers with pay as part of an ongoing dispute regarding a class the Anthropology department had assigned to him. Trivers said that he was told to teach the class even though he objected that he knew nothing about the specific subject. In his first lecture, Trivers told the class he would do his best to learn the subject along with them and with the help of guest lecturers. Rutgers suspended Trivers for involving the students in the controversy. Trivers told the Rutgers campus newsletter that Rutgers's officials refused to meet with him. Trivers also told the student paper: \"You would think the university would show a little respect for my teaching abilities on subjects that I know about and not force me to teach a course on a subject that I do not at all master.\"\n\nTrivers is among the most influential evolutionary theorists alive today. Steven Pinker considers Trivers to be \"one of the great thinkers in the history of Western thought\", who has:\n\n...inspired an astonishing amount of research and commentary in psychology and biology—the fields of sociobiology, evolutionary psychology, Darwinian social science, and behavioral ecology are in large part attempt to test and flesh out Trivers's ideas. It is no coincidence that E. O. Wilson's \"\" and Richard Dawkins' \"The Selfish Gene\" were published in 1975 and 1976 respectively, just a few years after Trivers's seminal papers. Both bestselling authors openly acknowledged that they were popularizing Trivers's ideas and the research they spawned. Likewise for the much-talked-about books on evolutionary psychology in the 1990s—\"The Adapted Mind\", \"\", \"Born to Rebel\", \"The Origins of Virtue\", \"The Moral Animal\", and my own \"How the Mind Works\". Each of these books is based in large part on Trivers's ideas and the explosion of research they inspired (involving dozens of animal species, mathematical and computer modeling, and human social and cognitive psychology.\n\n\n"}

It is an Italian-American dish and is related to various regional fish soups and stews of Italian cuisine.\n\nCioppino is traditionally made from the catch of the day, which in San Francisco is typically a combination of Dungeness crab, clams, shrimp, scallops, squid, mussels and fish, all sourced from salt-water ocean, in this case the Pacific. The seafood is then combined with fresh tomatoes in a wine sauce.\n\nThe dish can be served with toasted bread, either local sourdough or French bread. The bread acts as a starch, similar to a pasta, and is dipped into the sauce.\n\nCioppino was developed in the late 1800s by Italian immigrants who fished off Meiggs Wharf and lived in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco, many from the port city of Genoa. When a fisherman came back empty handed, they would walk around with a pot to the other fishermen asking them to chip in whatever they could. What ever ended up in the pot became their Cioppino. The fishermen that chipped in expected the same treatment if they came back empty handed in the future. It later became a staple as Italian restaurants proliferated in San Francisco.\n\nThe name comes from \"ciupin\" (also spelled \"ciuppin\") which is the name of a classic soup from the Italian region Liguria, similar in flavor to cioppino but with less tomato and using Mediterranean seafood cooked to the point that it falls apart.\n\nThe dish also shares its origin with other regional Italian variations of seafood stew similar to \"ciupin\", including \"cacciucco\" from Tuscany, \"brodetto di pesce\" from Abruzzo and others. Similar dishes can be found in coastal regions throughout the Mediterranean, from Portugal to Greece. Examples of these include \"suquet de peix\" from Catalan-speaking regions and \"bouillabaisse\" from Provence.\n\nThe earliest printed description of cioppino is from a 1901 recipe in \"The San Francisco Call\", though the stew is called \"chespini\". \"Cioppino\" first appears in 1906 in \"The Refugee's Cookbook\", a fundraising effort to benefit San Franciscans displaced by the 1906 earthquake and fire.\n\nGenerally the seafood is cooked in broth and served in the shell, including the crab, which is often served halved or quartered. It therefore requires special utensils, typically a crab fork and cracker. Depending on the restaurant, it may be accompanied by a bib to prevent food stains on clothing, a damp napkin and a second bowl for the shells. A variation, commonly called \"lazy man's cioppino\", is served with shells pre-cracked or removed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2089678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089678", "title": "Black-faced spoonbill", "text": "Black-faced spoonbill\n\nThe black-faced spoonbill (\"Platalea minor\") is a species of wading bird in the ibis and spoonbill family Threskiornithidae, found in eastern Asia. This species has the most restricted distribution of the six spoonbill species, and it is the only one regarded as endangered. Spoonbills are large water birds with dorso-ventrally flattened, spatulate bills. These birds use a tactile method of feeding, wading in the water and sweeping their beaks from side-to-side to detect prey. Confined to the coastal areas of eastern Asia, it seems that it was once common throughout its area of distribution. It currently breeds only on a few small rocky islands off the west coast of North Korea, with four wintering sites at Macau, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Vietnam, as well as other places where they have been observed in migration. Wintering also occurs in Jeju, South Korea, Kyushu and Okinawa, Japan, and the Red River delta in Vietnam. More recently, sightings of black-faced spoonbill birds were noted in Thailand, the Philippines, and additional sites in China. They were internationally classified as an endangered species by the IUCN in 2000. Declines in their population are predicted in the future, mainly due to the amount of deforestation, pollution, and other man-made industries.\n\nThe black-faced spoonbill population in the 2012 census was recorded at 2,693 birds, with an estimation of 1,600 mature birds. Breeding colonies occur between March and August, on small islands. These birds are known to be crepuscular eaters, using intertidal mudflats.\n\nConservation efforts have been made, and surveys were taken in order to determine the opinions and awareness of the local residents, residing close to the black-faced spoonbill's natural habitats. One survey taken by Jin et al. 2008, inquired upon the ‘Willingness-To-Pay” factor in the locals, as well as understanding effects on mandatory surcharges compared to voluntary payments.\n\nA study of mitochondrial DNA of the spoonbills found that the black-faced and royal spoonbills were each other's closest relatives. Out of the six \"Platalea\" species within the family Threskiornithidae, the black-faced spoonbill is the rarest.\n\nBlack-faced spoonbills reached a serious low in population in the 1990s, but by 2003 their numbers increased to at least 1,069 counted individuals. While it is known that their breeding area covers northeastern China and several islands between North and South Korea, human-assisted breeding efforts have not been overly successful due to the difficulty in sexing the black-faced spoonbills, yet using the polymerase chain reaction technique on DNA samples has allowed researchers to use another method to correctly sex adult Platalea minor specimens.\n\nAfter migrating to their wintering locations, black-faced spoonbills return with yellow breeding plumage, which extends from the back of their heads to their breasts.\nWhile this plumage only develops during the third or fourth year of life when the black-billed spoonbill is sexually mature, only about half of black-faced spoonbills with this plumage breed each breeding season, which contributes to the very slow pace at which the population numbers are increasing.\n\nThe global population of this species, is likely based on the winter population count which was carried out in 1988–1990 in all known sites. This count estimated about only 288 individuals. As of 2006, following sustained conservation efforts, the estimated global population had increased to 1,679 ; the 2008 census resulted in an estimated total count of 2,065 individuals ; and a 2010 census reported 2,346 . The known localised population of North Korea is not known to exceed 30 birds. However, there is believed to be another, so far undiscovered colony which provides regional population stability and it is assumed to be probably located in north-east China; for example, on the islands of Liaoning (near the Korean nesting zone).\n\nAs black-faced spoonbills are migratory birds, their conservation is based on the protection of their breeding, \"stop-over\" and wintering grounds, making conservation efforts complex. However, spoonbills are able to adapt to disturbances of large-scale. The exact distribution of the species remains unclear, although some attempts at modelling population developments under climate change impacts have been made.\n\nIt is thought that the principal cause of the decline of this species is the destruction of its habitat, more particularly the \"valorization\" of intertidal mudholes for agriculture, and more recently aquaculture and industrialization. The Korean War (1950–1953) must also have had a negative impact on the species, because the birds ceased nesting in South Korea at that time. In Japan, where it was once common for them to winter, they became extremely rare at this same time, and in later years there has never been a winter in which more than 5 birds were observed.\n\nWith the construction of a Shinkansen bridge in the Yatsushiro Sea between 2004 and 2009 next to a very important migration site for the black-faced spoonbills, many feared that it would cause their numbers to decrease. Thankfully, because of carefully planned out measures implemented in order to counter act the construction of the bridge, the population actually managed to increase during the time of construction.\n\nHuman disturbances can also be much more direct. Many humans disturb mating patterns unknowingly by taking photographs of birds during their mating time, leading to a decrease in offspring. Other humans willingly take eggs for selfish reasons, which accounted for 10% of the eggs taken in the Xing-Ren Tuo region of China in 1999.\n\nThe bird is a protected species in China as part of the \"China Red Data Book\"; its stopover site at Jiuduansha off Shanghai is a national nature preserve. In Hong Kong, it is a protected species under Wild Animals Protection Ordinance Cap 200. In Mai Po Marshes, a quarter of the world's population of black-faced spoonbill can be found during migration.\n\nThe species is reasonably well protected in North Korea, where their nesting islands off the coast were declared a Zone of Protection with restricted access. There remain nevertheless several threats, mainly in the wintering zones. The need for land to assign to industry is great in the wintering sites in Taiwan, whereas those in Vietnam are being converted for shrimp breeding, though they are within a reserve subject to the Ramsar Convention.\n\nDuring the winter months, over half of the black-faced spoonbill population migrates to the Chiku Wetland in southwestern Taiwan. The birds incapable of catching large fish; therefore many of them rely on the largescale mullets to feed off of in the winter months spent in the wetlands. These mullets however have recently become endangered due to the increase of spoonbill population who spend the winter months there (minimum of 191 birds in 1991/1992 up to a minimum of 840 in 2004/2005). Conservation of the largescale mullet is imperative in order to continue to sustain the endangered black-faced spoonbills.\n\nIn Hong Kong, disturbances by fishermen and shell gatherers often prevent the birds from feeding at low tide. In addition, with the continued expansion of human populations in the Far East, pollution will probably become an important problem. Disease has the ability to devastate the black-face spoonbills as well. In the winter of 2002/2003, 73 of the population died due to avian botulism. It may be necessary to establish additional protective areas or reserves in order to not let the population of birds to succumb to disease.\n\nThe black-faced spoonbill is legally recognized as natural monument #205 and a first-class endangered species in South Korea\n\n"}

He was a magnificent mark and a superb kick. Archival footage shows him using the now defunct drop kick for his kick-ins. In slow motion they demonstrate his perfect balance and timing.\n\nRegan was among the best players in the Magpies' 1935 and 1936 premiership victories, both against South Melbourne.\n\nIn May 1938, during a match against Carlton, Regan fell heavily and suffered a double dislocation of an elbow. He spent a week at St Vincent's Hospital, and ended up missing nine matches. He recovered in time to play a part in Collingwood's finals campaign, but again for the second successive year was on the losing end as Carlton emerged victorious with the 1938 pennant.\n\nIn January 1942 Regan announced his retirement from football to join the Salesian community at Sunbury as a lay brother.\n\nIn February 1943, with Australia now involved heavily in the Second World War, Regan enlisted with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and served as a leading aircraftman. He returned in 1943 to captain Collingwood.\n\nIn April 1946, shortly after being discharged from military service, Regan returned to Collingwood and trained so well that he was selected for their Round 1 match of the 1946 season against Hawthorn.\n\nIn March 1947, it was announced that Regan had been appointed coach of Kalgoorlie City Football Club in Goldfields Football League.\n\nEssendon champion Dick Reynolds considered Regan the best full-back he ever saw. In an article for Melbourne newspaper \"The Argus\" Reynolds recounted watching Regan play state football against the likes of Ken Farmer from South Australia and George Doig from Western Australia and said: \"[H]e made them earn every goal they kicked against him. It was great to see the way in which he shadowed them or marked or punched the ball away, and then, with great dash and a beautiful kick, sent the ball in the right position for an attack. His quick thinking and unruffled style at critical moments made him a star full-back.\"\n\nDuring his playing career, Regan had worked as a clerk for the Commonwealth Social Service in Melbourne. After returning to Melbourne from Kalgoorlie he continued to serve at Collingwood for many years, and was club secretary from 1969 to 1977.\n\nRegan was among the first players inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996, but was overlooked for the full-back position when the Team of the Century was named. That honour went instead to Carlton's Stephen Silvagni, to the bewilderment of many in the Australian football community. In 1997, when the Collingwood Team of the Century was announced, Regan was named at full-back.\n\nIn 2004, at the launch of the Collingwood Hall of Fame, Regan was one of 18 inducted players.\n\nThe Collingwood player who finishes fifth in the club's best-and-fairest count is awarded the Jack Regan Trophy.\n\n\n"}

Its sequel is \"My Mother's Castle\". It is the first of four volumes in Pagnol's \"Souvenirs d'enfance\" series. It is also a 1990 film based on the novel, and directed by Yves Robert.\n\nA poetic novel about his family and his early years rather than a literal autobiography, Pagnol opens with the stories of his two parents, Joseph and Augustine, and his own arrival in 1895 as their first child in the little town of Aubagne among the mountains of Provence. A school teacher there, the fiercely secular and socialist Joseph then gets a better job in the bustling city of Marseille. There his mother's sister Rose is courted by the fiercely conservative and Catholic Jules, who marries her. Despite striking many sparks off each other, the two brothers-in-law overall enjoy each other's company. So much so that in 1904 they agree to rent a remote farmhouse outside the village of La Treille, where the two families can spend their summer together and get back to the simple pleasures of rural life. After a long struggle up mountain tracks, with their belongings on a mule, they reach what for young Marcel is an earthly paradise. He falls instantly in love with the wild landscape, its distinctive vegetation and its abundant wildlife. \n\nWhile he and his little brother Paul spend their days in happy play among the hills, his father and uncle have weightier business. It will soon be the opening of the shooting season and, now they are proper countrymen rather than city intellectuals, they must be out with shotguns in search of game. As Joseph has never fired a gun in his life, Jules has all the pleasure of teaching the ignorant teacher the mysteries of this craft. In addition to learning how to use the weapon, Joseph has to learn how to bring down all the different sorts of game, above all the most legendarily difficult and rewarding local bird. This is the rock partridge, of which few men have hit more than a couple of tail feathers. On the great day, the two set off and young Marcel disobeys them by following, for he is terribly worried that his shy spectacle-wearing father will be humiliated by the loud know-all uncle. Trying to keep out of sight, the boy gets lost in the uninhabited mountains, until after several hours he hears two shots in quick succession. Out of the sky near his feet fall two rock partridges. His father got them, his only kill of the day, by firing both barrels. Next day, Joseph volunteers to go down to the village for the shopping and ties the two carcasses to his belt. The whole community is lost in admiration for his unparallelled feat and the priest is so impressed that he overcomes Joseph's atheist scruples by rushing home for a camera to record this historic moment.\n"}

Together with Chris Russo, he launched \"Mike and the Mad Dog\" in 1989 on WFAN in New York City, one of the most successful sports-talk radio programs in American history.\n\nOn December 15, 2017, Francesa retired from his own show, \"Mike's On: Francesa on the FAN\", which had been airing in the afternoon drive slot formerly occupied by \"Mike and the Mad Dog\". He was succeeded by Chris Carlin, Maggie Gray and Bart Scott in the same time slot for the first ratings book of 2018. \n\nOn April 27, 2018, WFAN announced that Francesa would return to the station for a -hour afternoon show, a shorter shift than his original slot. Francesa hosted this shortened afternoon drive WFAN slot in a tumultuous tenure through the end of 2019 before he retired for a second time, moving to a half-hour evening slot on WFAN while also producing content for the Entercom-owned Radio.com platform, which began in January 2020. On March 24th, 2020, Francesa was tapped to return to the station for a daytime slot on Sundays, and on May 26th, 2020, he began returning to WFAN on weekdays for an hour each day. \n\nFrancesa started his career by spending six years at \"College and Pro Football Newsweekly\". He was hired by CBS Sports in 1982 as a researcher, focusing primarily on college sports. At CBS Sports, he was initially a behind-the-scenes, statistic-wielding editorial assistant, but network executives were so impressed by his knowledge that he was made a studio analyst for college basketball and football and acquired such a reputation that \"The New Yorker\" termed him \"Brent Musburger's brain.\"\n\nWhen he was a studio analyst at CBS Sports, he said the most common complaint he heard was about his New York accent.\n\nESPN tried to lure Francesa, as its studio expert on college football, college basketball and the NFL in 1991, but he declined their offer.\n\nFrancesa announced on the radio that he quit CBS on April 1, 1993 before the 1993 Final Four began.\n\nWhen WFAN was launched in 1987, Francesa applied for a host job. However, station management was looking for top-shelf types rather than someone with no experience, and he was only offered a producer's job, which he ended up rejecting. With his then-wife Kate's encouragement, Francesa continued to pursue WFAN. Finally, WFAN gave him a job as a weekend host talking college football and basketball in August 1987. Because of the positive reviews, Francesa began to guest-host other shows.\n\nBecause of his initial success as a weekend and fill-in host, he was teamed with local New York City host Ed Coleman, and the duo had a popular show on the 10 a.m.–2 p.m. slot. In 1989, WFAN was looking for hosts to replace the controversial Pete Franklin in the afternoon drive time period between 3 and 7 p.m. Station management decided to team the knowledgeable, but somewhat dry Francesa with the young and vibrant Chris Russo. While Francesa's brand of sports commentating was considered hard-hitting and serious, Russo's was lighter, unconventional, and more entertaining. The show was dubbed \"Mike and the Mad Dog\". The show quickly gained popularity and was a staple of the New York sports scene from 1989 to 2008. The duo won the 2000 Marconi Award for Major Market Personality of the Year. They were the first sports-talk hosts ever to win the award.\n\nFrancesa also hosted a weekly radio show called \"The NFL Now\", which originated from WFAN and aired from 1987 to 2016. It eventually became syndicated and at one time was simulcast on MSNBC and later via video Webcast on NBCSports.com. \"The NFL Now\" became a syndicated program again when WBZ-FM in Boston started airing the show, a few weeks after the station's launch.\n\nFrancesa also provided the nightly \"Sportstime\" commentary on the CBS Radio Network and Westwood One. Francesa regularly contributed to the \"Imus in the Morning\" program with his views on sports while it aired on WFAN and Westwood One.\n\nOn August 14, 2008, it was announced that Russo had decided to leave WFAN, and thus ended the \"Mike and the Mad Dog\" show two weeks shy of its 19th anniversary scenario. This ended two months of speculation of whether the show was going to make it to a 20th season. At the same time, Francesa signed a five-year deal to stay at WFAN. September 8, 2008 officially marked the kickoff of Francesa's new solo WFAN program, which he announced on air would be called \"Mike'd Up\", the same name as his former weekly television program on WNBC. Francesa on the FAN was seen on the YES Network from 2008 until 2014.\n\nOn January 17, 2012, the show was renamed \"Mike's On\". After Francesa left the show \"\" on WNBC, the television station retained the rights to the name of the show. NBC and CBS did not reach an agreement for the rights and WFAN changed the name.\n\nDuring his show's time on the YES Network, Francesa's trademark intro to a show hosted by himself was \"From the studios of WFAN in New York and simulcast across the country on the YES Network, this is \"Mike's On\": Francesa on the FAN.\"\n\nOn September 10, 2012, Francesa fell asleep live on air during a segment with Yankees beat reporter Sweeny Murti. He later denied he had fallen asleep after national ridicule and mockery including fans calling into the show.\n\nOn March 24, 2014, Francesa's show began broadcasting nationally on Fox Sports 1. He changed his trademark intro to the show to \"From the studios of WFAN in New York and simulcast across the country on Fox Sports 1, this is \"Mike's On: Francesa on the FAN\"\". The relationship with Fox Sports was tumultuous at times so, Francesa and Fox Sports did not renew the contract to continue simulcasting his radio show effective September 11, 2015. Francesa took primary responsibility for the relationship not succeeding. During his entire solo run, Francesa hosted the top-rated drive time sports talk show in the New York market.\n\nOn March 30, 2016, Francesa and Russo hosted the \"Mike and the Mad Dog\" reunion show at Radio City Music Hall.\n\nOn December 24, 2016, Francesa said goodbye on his last ever \"Mike Francesa Football Sunday\" after CBS didn't renew it for 2017.\n\nOn January 19, 2016, Francesa stated that he planned to leave WFAN when his contract with the station expired at the end of 2017. On May 3, 2017, WFAN announced \"WFAN Presents: Mike Francesa, A Night to Remember\", to be held at the LIU Post Tilles Center on November 15 at 7:30 p.m. WFAN held Francesa's Next-To-Last WFAN/New York Show Live From The Paley Center for Media. Mike's final day on the air on WFAN was December 15, 2017. Mike signed off at 6:26pm EST on December 15, 2017 with these final words:\n\n\"I want to thank you guys, the listeners, the audience. Because without you - we don't last a week. We don't last a month. So, what I'd like to say to you is, 'I will miss you. I thank you. And, from the bottom of my heart, I love you. Good bye.'\"\n\nOn April 24, 2018, just over 4 months after having retired from WFAN, Francesa announced his intention to return there. The station confirmed the decision stating that he would return to afternoon drive, albeit with a shorter show running from 3-6:30pm Monday through Friday.\n\nOn August 23, 2018, Francesa launched a subscription-based mobile app known as Mike's On, which provides a live video stream of Francesa's daily show on WFAN, archived interviews from previous shows, exclusively hosts Francesa's Sunday NFL show and Saturday college football show during their respective seasons, and occasional live reactions to sporting events. The $8.99 per-month price tag of the service was widely criticized by the media.\n\nAfter returning to WFAN, Francesa won the fall 2018 ratings book, the first since his return, with an average of 6.4 percent of the listening audience over The Michael Kay Show's 5.8, the show opposite his time slot on the New York ESPN affiliate WEPN-FM. The total included both the over-the-air radio listening audience and WFAN's online streaming audience, which has traditionally been included in the total audience rating because WFAN has different advertising on each format. Without the stream, Francesa would have still won the fall 2018 book during the time slot by a share of 5.9-5.8 over Kay's show.\n\nIn the winter 2019 ratings book, Francesa received a 6.2 percent share of the listening audience compared to the 5.9 received by The Michael Kay Show during the same time slot. The total included both the over-the-air share as well as the WFAN online streaming. However, Kay beat Francesa 5.9-5.5 in the radio segment, and both hosts claimed victory on their respective shows. After hearing that Kay was celebrating victory over the disputed ratings book, Francesa said on his April 15, 2019 show that \"I have nothing but sadness and pity for you that you would actually claim a victory that wasn't real” as well as saying that \"you're ESPN, and you get beat like a rented mule for 20 years, it's got to hurt\". Francesa later tweeted that \"there was only one possible way to read [the ratings]\" and that \"anyone, and that means anyone, who says differently is either a fool or a liar.\" Francesa also felt the stress of a close ratings battle for the first time in his NYC sports radio career, and got in a heated argument with WFAN management about the availability of a Craig Carton post-sentencing interview on the last few days of the book, after Carton was interviewed by Kay.\n\nOn April 28, 2019, Francesa became the center of controversy yet again, appearing to shame both the New York Giants and their 2019 6th-round draft pick Corey Ballentine after Ballentine was wounded in a drive-by shooting the day before. Francesa said that the incident contrasted with the \"great character\" of the draft class the Giants claimed to have picked, despite evidence that the shooting was completely randomized. After some media members picked up on the comments, such as Francesa's fellow WFAN hosts Boomer and Gio, Francesa did walk back the opinion on his next day's show, but not before tearing into his FAN counterparts in a fiery rant on their morning show the same day, accusing them of purposely distributing misinformation about him and his comments.\n\nOn May 16, 2019, Francesa fell asleep on the air again while taking a call from a listener.\n\nOn September 3, 2019, it was announced that WFAN's owner Entercom had acquired the intellectual property of the Mike's On app, and that its content would be integrated into the company's Radio.com platform instead, with no additional subscription required. The Mike's On app was discontinued by the end of September, with its content having been made available for free in the meantime. Francesa never revealed the number of paying customers to his app, which was roundly criticized by the media throughout its existence. \n\nWhile delivering his \"5 Minute Morning\" recording on November 4th, 2019, Francesa appeared to deliver flatulence on the air, which was picked up and turned into a mainstream news story on several online publications, including the New York Daily News. Francesa later denied the incident occurred, saying on his afternoon show the same day that it was \"fake news\" and that the media was desperate for a headline.\n\nIn the fall 2019 ratings book, Francesa's third full book since his return, his WFAN show lost to his ESPN rival The Michael Kay Show in direct head-to-head ratings, dethroning Francesa from the top of the New York sports ratings for the first time in his career, spanning back to 1989. In the book, Francesa was outrated by Kay 7.4-5.5, with Francesa's total share rising to 6.0 after including streaming. In response to his first-ever ratings book loss, Francesa criticized Kay and his co-hosts, claiming that \"celebrating [their] success now would be the same as spiking the football after finally scoring a TD in a game that is 77-0!\"\n\nDuring his radio comeback, Francesa's show was the target of criticism for reasons ranging from his frequent inaccurate predictions to his treatment of callers. His show was described as \"grumbles and contentious conversations with callers on a regular basis\" by Deadspin, and Francesa was particularly noted for responding negatively to a caller who told him that Stan Lee died. Video clips of Francesa making inaccurate predictions often went viral on Twitter, with players like Virginia basketball's Ty Jerome coming onto the show to specifically address them. Francesa also received attention for maintaining that Tiger Woods had \"nil\" chance after the second round to win the 2019 Masters Tournament, which Woods later won, and then later claiming that the video clips in question that showed the inaccurate predictions were doctored or altered.\n\nIn a November 2019 interview, Francesa's former Mike and the Mad Dog co-host Chris Russo called the bombastic radio comeback \"unhealthy\". Russo revealed that he and Francesa had not spoken since March 2018 and in a direct criticism of his un-retirement, said “Mike should never have come back. He should have stayed retired.\", while conjecturing he may have realized towards the end of his second afternoon drive run that it was a mistake.\n\nOn November 5th, 2019, Francesa announced his retirement from WFAN for a second time, announcing he would leave the station that December. On December 6th, 2019, he hosted his final afternoon show, giving thanks to both the station and the listeners.\n\nFrancesa's departure left WFAN looking for a replacement to their afternoon drive slot, which they eventually filled with Joe Benigno and Evan Roberts, who formerly hosted the midday show on the same network.\n\nAfter Francesa left afternoon drive, WFAN announced he would not be leaving the station altogether and would instead host a shortened show in a later timeslot. On December 16th, 2019, Francesa revealed he would host a 30 minute show on WFAN from 6:00-6:30, with an additional hour on Radio.com. Francesa announced that the show would be mostly freeform, saying that \"I can do whatever I want. I don’t have to sports. I can do politics. I can do whatever I want\" in terms of content.\n\nOn January 6th, 2020, Francesa debuted the first show on his new format, hosting a half-hour show on WFAN nights during the week while also hosting on Entercom's Radio.com platform. Francesa announced plans to branch out to more than New York sports, talking about national sports as well as political discussions. On the first day of his new show, Francesa announced that his political coverage would be \"played down the middle\", claiming to provide an unbiased centrist perspective.\n\nOn March 24th, 2020, Francesa returned to daytime sports radio at WFAN for the first time after his second retirement, taking a temporary weekends gig from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM on Sundays. Downsizing at the station due to Coronavirus concerns played a part in WFAN's hiring of the longtime host, who had retired for a second time in December 2019. In May 2020, WFAN announced a revamp to their afternoon plans, slotting in Francesa in his first weekday show on the network since his second retirement, giving him a 6:00-7:00 PM time window.\n\nDuring Francesa's May 21st, 2020 show, he ridiculed and laughed at reports of an unnamed NFL player who claimed he was sexually assaulted during a United Airlines flight, disputing the inability or willingness of the player to prevent the assault.\n\nFrancesa played a bookie in the 2019 film Uncut Gems, starring Adam Sandler. He also had a role playing himself in the 2003 TV movie Undefeated. \n\nFrancesa also appeared in the 2020 ESPN docuseries The Last Dance, featuring in a short 1993 clip showing him questioning Michael Jordan's desire to win.\n\nFrancesa was born and raised in Long Beach, New York. He is the second son of Michael Anthony Francesa, who abandoned the family when Francesa was eight years old. He has an older brother, John and a younger brother, Marty, who committed suicide on November 27, 1990. He attended Kellenberg Memorial High School in Uniondale (then known as Maria Regina High School), and graduated from St. John's University in 1977 (transferring there after one year at the University of South Florida), majoring in communications and athletic administration. He first married Kate in 1983 but divorced in 1994.\n\nCurrently a resident of Manhasset, New York, Francesa married his current wife, Rose (whom he usually refers to as Roe), on July 14, 2000, and they have three children, fraternal twins Emily Grace and Jack Patrick () and Harrison James (). In November 2019, Francesa bought a home in South Florida, reportedly due to his desire to pay less in tax money.\n\nIn April 2007, Francesa criticized Democratic Presidential nominees Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton after they called for the resignation of Don Imus, following comments Imus made about the Rutgers women's basketball team. \n\nIn 2016, Francesa came out as a supporter of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, supporting him as early as May 2016 and voting for him in the 2016 presidential election. He has previously expressed support for Trump's national anthem perspectives, tweeting that the \"NFL has lost its way\" by allowing players to kneel for the playing of the national anthem. Francesa also brushed off reports that President Trump's finances were in trouble, pointing out that he was still able to win the 2016 election. \n\nDespite voting for Trump, Francesa claimed in January 2020 that he would be providing an \"unbiased\" moderate political perspective on his Radio.com show.\n\nIn March 2020, Francesa criticized Trump's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDuring the first week of June 2006, Francesa missed a few days on the radio for what was termed as \"personal reasons.” Soon after returning on the June 8, 2006, show he revealed that following medical tests, he needed to change his diet due to his weight struggles. He also admitted to going to the hospital to get an angioplasty done. Francesa had emergency knee surgery on August 31, 2006, to repair his shattered kneecap when he played golf the day before in Westhampton Beach, New York.\n\nIn 2012, Mike Francesa was ranked No. 1 of the 100 most important sports talk radio hosts in America by \"Talkers Magazine\". Francesa credited colleagues at WFAN for his success, with a special salute to Russo. He remained the No. 1 sports talk radio host by \"Talkers\" in 2013 and 2014. Additionally, Francesa won the 2012 Marconi Award for Major Market Personality of the Year\n\n"}

The game focuses on the humorous adventures of the game's two main characters, Sid E. Mouse and Al E. Cat (both puns on 'city mouse' and 'alley cat', respectively), as each tries to make life unbearable for the other. It features 100 puzzles and an editor which allows the player to design his or her own puzzles. The main objective of the game is to finish a \"puzzle-piece\" photograph by completing each puzzle. When each puzzle (or level) is completed a missing piece on the photograph is replaced.\n\n\"Sid & Al's Incredible Toons\" is the predecessor of \"The Incredible Toon Machine\".\n\nThe game received positive reviews from critics. \"Computer Gaming World\" in 1994 said that \"\"Sid & Al's Incredible Toons\" was \"exactly what I wanted from a sequel to \"The Incredible Machine\", with more challenging puzzles, \"hysterically funny\" animation and sound, and \"a host of small improvements\". The magazine praised the many possible reactions from combining characters, the \"66 different objects\", and the manual, concluding that \"Sid & Al\" \"will certainly show up on best game of the year lists\".

{"id": "2089760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089760", "title": "Chris Tremlett", "text": "Chris Tremlett\n\nChristopher Timothy Tremlett (born 2 September 1981) is a former English cricketer who played international cricket for England and domestically for Hampshire and Surrey. He was a tall fast-medium bowler able to extract bounce on most surfaces. Tremlett started his playing career with Hampshire in 2000 and was awarded his county cap in 2004. He made his One Day International debut in 2005, and two years later played his first Test. Tremlett played three Tests in 2007 before injury interrupted.\n\nTremlett moved to Surrey for the start of 2010 after struggling with injury. Following this move, he forced his way back into the Test team and participated in England's victory in the 2010–11 Ashes in Australia. He was a competent number 8 or 9 batsman, with seven first-class fifties to his name and has a strong arm from the deep.\n\nHe retired from all forms of cricket on 21 August 2015 due to injury. Tremlett had been affected by back and knee injuries in recent years and was restricted to three Championship appearances for Surrey in 2015. In retirement he took up weightlifting and in June 2017 he shared a picture of his body transformation which went viral on the internet.\n\nTremlett started career at Hursley Park CC. Tremlett took a wicket with his first ball in first-class cricket against New Zealand A in 1999, dismissing Mark Richardson. He went to India with the Under-19s in 2000/01, and was one of the first cricketers to attend the ECB Academy the following year.\n\nTremlett won the NBC Denis Compton Award in both 2000 and 2001. His grandfather Maurice played three times for England in the 1940s and also for Somerset, while his father Tim turned a playing career into a coaching job at Hampshire, and has coached his son during Chris's entire professional career.\n\nIn 2005 he made his England debut in a One Day International against Bangladesh at Trent Bridge, Nottingham, taking 4–32 and missing out on a hat-trick only by a freak occurrence: the hat-trick ball fell onto the top of Mohammad Ashraful's stumps, but did not dislodge a bail. To demonstrate his continuing progress Tremlett was regularly selected in England's 12 for the Ashes Tests later in 2005 but due to the success and consistency of the first choice bowlers he did not make his debut. He was also selected for the 2005–06 season tour to Pakistan, but had to withdraw because of injury. After undergoing surgery to his right knee and hip, he also missed the tour to India.\nTremlett was in and out of the Hampshire team in April and May, playing two Championship matches against Sussex and Warwickshire, and taking four wickets, and was then diagnosed with a side strain. He returned to take six wickets in seven matches in Hampshire's Twenty20 Cup campaign, and featured in four more Championship matches, to bring his tally for the season to 30 wickets at a bowling average of 21.70, the lowest at the club, including a spell of six for 89 in a two-wicket loss to Warwickshire.\n\nAfter struggling with injury and form in 2009 at Hampshire, Tremlett left to join Surrey on a three-year contract. The pitches at the Rose Bowl were not suited to Tremlett's bowling style, and it was felt that The Oval would be a more fruitful hunting ground. The end of the 2009 season saw a great deal of change in Surrey's squad, with nine players leaving; Tremlett was the fifth player to join the club before the start of the 2010 season. Tremlett was selected by the MCC to play against Durham, the champion county, in March 2010 but was withdrawn on the insistence of Surrey manager Chris Adams to minimise the risk of injury early in Surrey's season.\n\nAfter cutting down his run up and increasing his pace through work with Hampshire team mates Shane Warne and Stuart Clark, Tremlett came back into Test contention in 2007 after a rash of injuries to established bowlers. He played for the England Lions against India in their final warm up game before the first Test and finally made his Test début at Lords against India on 19 July 2007 after Matthew Hoggard was ruled out with a back complaint. His grandfather having played Test cricket, Chris Tremlett became the fourth grandson of a Test cricketer to make a Test debut without his father having also played Tests. He is also the first Hampshire born Hampshire county cricketer to play a Test in England. He made a pair on debut, but took 4 wickets and during his second match, he took 3 wickets in each innings, and finished with figures of 3/12 as India cruised to a 7-wicket victory needing just 73 to win.\nHe was selected for the squad for the 2010 Ashes tour to Australia. He was not selected to play in either of the first two tests, but in the first day of the third test, held at Perth, he took 3 wickets for 63 runs, troubling the Australian top order with the steepling bounce allowed for by the WACA surface. He followed that up with 5 for 87 in the Australian second innings. On the first day of the fourth test, the Boxing Day Test held at the MCG, he took 4 for 26 as England skittled Australia out for 98 runs. He took the last wicket in the last test, and with it, England won the series.\n\nDuring the summer of 2011, in the third match against Sri Lanka, he took his best Test figures of 6/48 as England bowled out Sri Lanka for 184. With 15 dismissals, Tremlett finished as the leading wicket-taker in the series on either side. India toured in July for four Tests, five ODIs, and a T20I. Selected for the opening match of the Test series, Tremlett took 4/124 in England's victory, extracting bounce from the Lord's pitch to trouble the Indian batsmen. However, he was hampered by injury with a hamstring problem on the fourth day of the first Test and a back spasm during pre-match training ahead of the second Test. The back injury prevented Tremlett from playing any further part in the series. In September, for the first time Tremlett was awarded one of 13 central contracts with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) until September 2012.\n\nAfter testing his fitness in November 2011, he was included in England's squad to play Pakistan in the UAE in the following January. While Tremlett was absent through injury, Tim Bresnan established himself in the team and Tremlett was left competing with Steven Finn for a place in the team. Bresnan suffered an injury and Tremlett was selected in his place for the first Test. However, a back injury ended his tour before the second Test. Examinations revealed the problem was a bulging disc and in February Tremlett underwent surgery.\n\n"}
{"id": "2089765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089765", "title": "Nostoi", "text": "Nostoi\n\nThe Nostoi (, \"Nostoi\", \"Returns\"), also known as Returns or Returns of the Greeks, is a lost epic of ancient Greek literature. It was one of the Epic Cycle, that is, the Trojan cycle, which told the entire history of the Trojan War in epic verse. The story of the \"Nostoi\" comes chronologically after that of the \"Iliou persis\" (\"Sack of Ilium\"), and is followed by that of the \"Odyssey\". The author of the \"Nostoi\" is uncertain: ancient writers attributed the poem variously to Agias (8th century BC), Homer (8th century BC), and Eumelos (8th century BC) (see Cyclic poets). The poem comprised five books of verse in dactylic hexameter. The word \"nostos\" means \"return home\".\n\nThe date of composition of the \"Nostoi\", and the date when it was set in writing, are both very uncertain. The text is most likely to have been finalized in the seventh or sixth century BC.\n\nThe \"Nostoi\" relates the return home of the Greek heroes after the end of the Trojan War. In current critical editions only five and a half lines of the poem's original text survive. For its storyline we are almost entirely dependent on a summary of the Cyclic epics contained in the \"chrestomathy\" attributed to an unknown Proklos (possibly to be identified with the 2nd-century-AD grammarian Eutychios Proklos). A few other references also give indications of the poem's storyline.\n\nThe poem opens as the Greeks are getting ready to set sail back to Greece. The goddess Athena is wrathful because of the Greeks' impious behaviour in the sack of Troy (see \"Iliou persis\"). Agamemnon waits behind, to appease her; Diomedes and Nestor set sail straightaway, and reach home safely; Menelaus sets sail, but encounters a storm, loses most of his ships, lands in Egypt and is delayed there for several years. Other Greeks, including the prophet Calchas, go by land to Kolophon, where Calchas dies and is buried.\n\nAs Agamemnon is getting ready to sail, Achilles's ghost appears to him and foretells his fate. Agamemnon makes a sacrifice and sets sail anyway; Neoptolemus, however, is visited by his grandmother, the sea-nymph Thetis, who tells him to wait and make further sacrifices to the gods. Zeus sends a storm against Agamemnon and those accompanying him at Athena's request, and the lesser Ajax dies on the Kapherian rocks on the southern end of Euboia. Neoptolemus follows Thetis's advice and goes home by land; in Thrace he meets Odysseus at Maroneia, who has traveled there by sea. Neoptolemus arrives home, though Phoenix dies \"en route\", and there he is recognised by his grandfather Peleus.\n\nAgamemnon arrives home and is there murdered by his wife Clytemnestra and her lover, Agamemnon's cousin Aegisthus. Later Agamemnon's and Clytemnestra's son Orestes avenges the murder by killing both of them. Finally Menelaus arrives home from Egypt. (This last section, known as the \"Oresteia\", is narrated in \"Odyssey\" books 3 and 4 by Nestor and Menelaos; and it was later also the basis for Aeschylus' trilogy of tragic plays, the \"Oresteia\".)\n\nAt the end of the \"Nostoi\" the only living Greek hero who still has not returned home is Odysseus. His return is narrated in the \"Odyssey\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2089777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089777", "title": "Hendrick Motorsports", "text": "Hendrick Motorsports\n\nHendrick Motorsports (HMS), formerly named All Star Racing, is an American professional stock car racing team that currently competes in the NASCAR Cup Series. The team, created in 1984 by Rick Hendrick, is one of stock car racing's premier organizations. As of 2020, Hendrick Motorsports has won twelve Cup Series owners and drivers championships, three Truck Series owners and drivers titles, and one Nationwide Series drivers crown, 258 NASCAR Cup Series victories, 26 Nationwide Series wins, and 26 Camping World Truck Series victories. As of the 2016 season, the team has won a Cup Series race on every track on the current circuit – except for Kentucky Speedway, which has only been on the circuit since 2011.\n\nHendrick Motorsports currently fields four full-time Cup Series teams with the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 1LE, including the No. 9 NAPA/UniFirst/Hooters/Mountain Dew/Kelley Blue Book for Chase Elliott, the No. 24 Axalta/Liberty University/Hertz for William Byron, the No. 48 Ally Financial for Jimmie Johnson, and the No. 88 Valvoline/Chevy Goods/Axalta Coating Systems/LLumar/Cincinnati Inc. for Alex Bowman. The team formerly fielded teams in the now-NASCAR Xfinity Series before merging its efforts with JR Motorsports. Hendrick Motorsports also fielded several trucks in the NASCAR Truck Series, most recently for development driver Chase Elliott in 2013. The team has fielded cars in the past for many NASCAR drivers, including Hall of Famers Jeff Gordon, Mark Martin, Terry Labonte, Darrell Waltrip and Benny Parsons and other notables such as Geoff Bodine, Tim Richmond, Ricky Rudd, Ken Schrader, Ricky Craven, Joe Nemechek, Kyle Busch, Casey Mears, Brian Vickers, Kasey Kahne, and Dale Earnhardt Jr.\n\nAll Hendrick race cars are constructed start-to-finish at the 100-plus acre Hendrick Motorsports complex in Concord, North Carolina. More than 550 engines are built or re-built on-site each year, with the team leasing some of those to Chip Ganassi Racing (CGR). They currently have a technical alliance with JTG Daugherty Racing. Hendrick Motorsports employs over 500 people that perform many day-to-day activities. Since 1995, Hendrick Motorsports have won 12 NASCAR Premier series championships; a record tying 7 for Jimmie Johnson, 4 for Jeff Gordon and 1 for Terry Labonte.\n\nWhat is now Hendrick Motorsports was founded prior to the 1984 season by Rick Hendrick, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based car dealership owner who currently operates a network of dealerships called Hendrick Auto Group. The team was formed along with longtime crew chief and car builder Harry Hyde, NHRA and NASCAR team owner Raymond Beadle, and music entrepreneur C.K. Spurlock as All-Star Racing. The team, called Hendrick Motorsports by 1985, expanded to two full-time cars in 1986, three in 1987, and four in 2002. HMS was one of the first teams in NASCAR to be successful operating multiple entries, based on the model used at the Hendrick dealerships. The team has also been credited for innovations in engine construction and pit crew training.\n\nThe No. 5 debuted in 1984 under the banner \"All Star Racing\" with five employees, rented equipment, and two cars, with the highest-paid person's wages at only $500/week. Initially, the team had planned to field a car for seven-time Cup champion Richard Petty with funding from country music business mogul C.K. Spurlock, but the deal failed to materialize. Afterwards, Hendrick attempted to hire Tim Richmond, then Dale Earnhardt, but did not. As a result, the team signed former Rookie of the Year Geoff Bodine to drive the unsponsored No. 5 Chevy Monte Carlo for 1984. After a slow start seven races into the season, Hendrick informed Bodine and crew chief Harry Hyde that he planned to shut down the team due to funding trouble. Instead, Bodine and the team won at Martinsville Speedway, leading to sponsorship from Northwestern Security Life; on March 30, 2014, the 30-year anniversary of the win, Hendrick stated, \"We owe Martinsville so much. If we hadn't won that race, then literally the next Monday we were going to shut it down.\" The team won two more times and finished ninth in points. Levi Garrett came on to sponsor the No. 5 Chevy in 1985 as part of a multi-year deal. Despite not winning a race that year, Bodine earned three poles and improved to fifth in points. The team briefly became a two-car operation when Dick Brooks drove the No. 1 Exxon Chevy at Charlotte Motor Speedway, in what proved to be Brooks' last NASCAR race.\nHendrick expanded into a multi-car team full-time in 1986, with Bodine and Tim Richmond as drivers. Bodine won twice in the No. 5 and posted an eighth-place finish in points. His younger brother, Brett, raced as a teammate in the World 600 that year. Bodine went winless again in 1987, finishing thirteenth in points. Bodine won one race each of the next two years before leaving for Junior Johnson & Associates in 1990.\n\nRicky Rudd took Bodine's place, winning once at Watkins Glen International, and finishing seventh in points. For 1991, the team received sponsorship from Tide as part of the car's merger with Darrell Waltrip's old team. Winning one race that year, Rudd finished a career high second in points behind champion Dale Earnhardt. On the final lap of that year's race at Sears Point Raceway, second-place Rudd spun out leader Davey Allison on the last turn and went on to win. NASCAR penalized the team for rough driving and awarded Allison the win. Rudd won once each of the next two years. Dissatisfied with the distribution of resources within HMS's multiple teams, Rudd left to form his own team, taking Tide with him.\n\nRudd's replacement was 1984 Winston Cup champion Terry Labonte. The car received sponsorship from Kellogg's and their Corn flakes brand. Labonte won three races each in 1994 and 1995, and defeated teammate Jeff Gordon for the 1996 Winston Cup championship by 37 points. Labonte won one race each of the next three seasons. The 2000 season was a very difficult year for the team as two long streaks that defined Labonte's career came to an end. In the Pepsi 400, Labonte crashed his car and broke his leg. After an accident at New Hampshire damaged his inner ear, Labonte was not capable of driving, and he ended up missing two races, bringing his streak of most consecutive races to an abrupt end. Todd Bodine and Ron Hornaday, Jr. subbed for Labonte. His six-year winning streak was also broken as he failed to visit victory lane that year.\n\nAt the end of the 2000 season Labonte's team switched to Kellogg's Frosted Flakes brand for its primary sponsorship. After a couple of low-key years, Labonte finished tenth in the points in 2003. He also revisited victory lane after a four-year drought by winning the Southern 500 at Darlington, the last Southern 500 to be held during the Labor Day weekend until 2015. After slipping to twenty-sixth in points in 2004, Labonte announced his semi-retirement. He would drive a limited schedule for two years in the No. 44 car before leaving HMS after the 2006 season. Labonte scored 12 victories with Hendrick Motorsports, to go along with his championship in 1996.\n\nHendrick tabbed development driver Kyle Busch, the younger brother of Kurt Busch, as Labonte's replacement for the 2005 season. Busch easily won the 2005 rookie of the year battle and made history when he took the checkered flag in the Sony HD 500 at California Speedway for his first win, becoming the youngest driver to ever win a Cup Series race at the age of 20 years, 4 months, and 2 days. Busch would win later that year at Phoenix. In 2006, Kyle won once and qualified for the Chase for the Nextel Cup, ultimately finishing tenth in points. In 2007, Busch grabbed a win at the Food City 500, the inaugural race for the Car of Tomorrow. On June 13, 2007 Hendrick announced that Kyle Busch would not return to drive the No. 5 car in 2008.\n\nOn September 4, 2007 it was announced that Casey Mears would drive the No. 5 in 2008. On June 22, 2008, ESPN.com reported that Mark Martin would leave Dale Earnhardt, Inc. to replace Casey Mears in the No. 5 car for the 2009 season. On Friday, July 4 at Daytona International Raceway, Hendrick and Martin announced that Martin had agreed to a two-year contract in the No. 5 car.\n\nMark Martin scored his first win with Hendrick Motorsports at Phoenix on April 18, 2009. He became the third oldest winner and fourth driver over the age of 50 to win a Cup Series race. The win was also the 36th victory and 400th top 10 of Martin's career. Martin won four more races in 2009, Darlington, Michigan, Chicagoland, and New Hampshire. He also won seven pole positions in addition to finishing second in the point standings to teammate Jimmie Johnson. On September 18, 2009, Hendrick announced that Martin had extended his contract through the 2011 season and would race full-time with GoDaddy.com as a primary sponsor.\n\nIn 2010, Martin struggled, ending the season 13th in the point standings with no wins and only one pole position, which came in the Daytona 500. His season best finish of second came in October at Martinsville. Lance McGrew took over as crew chief for the No. 5 in 2011 as Gustafson moved to Jeff Gordon's team. Farmers Insurance Group and Quaker State joined as sponsors of the team for a few races. Martin struggled through most of the season with McGrew, not showing signs of his earlier Hendrick success. Teammate Jimmie Johnson drove the No. 5 car in the All-Star Race to promote a discount deal with Lowe's (Martin moved over to the No. 25 for the evening). Martin ended the year 22nd in points, having won two pole positions, the second races at both Daytona and Talladega. The team scored only two top fives all season, a second at Dover and a fourth at Michigan.\n\nKasey Kahne and his crew chief Kenny Francis were picked up from Red Bull Racing Team to run the No. 5 in 2012. Farmers and Quaker State returned, with Farmers increasing its sponsorship to 22 races. GoDaddy.com left for Tommy Baldwin Racing/Stewart-Haas Racing to sponsor Danica Patrick, but Time Warner Cable and Great Clips signed on as replacements. After a poor start to the season, Kahne rebounded immensely and picked up a win in the Coca-Cola 600. He won again at New Hampshire in July and made the 2012 Chase, finishing a career-best 4th in standings. Kahne also won four pole positions throughout the season.\nKahne won twice in 2013, at Bristol in March and Pocono in August, and again qualified for the Chase in 2013. However, he fell toward the bottom of the Chase standings and ended up finishing 12th in points. The team struggled immensely in 2014, and it did not appear that Kahne would qualify for the 2014 Chase until a last-minute win at Atlanta in late August locked him into the Chase field. Kahne was eliminated from the Chase following the October Talladega race (as a result of a new Chase format) and finished 15th in the final point standings. Kahne then struggled in 2015 & 2016 as he barely missed the Chase field and failed to reach victory lane in both seasons. On July 23, 2017 Kahne held off Brad Keselowski in an overtime finish that ended under caution to win the 2017 Brickyard 400 for his 18th (& final) overall career victory, 102 races after his 2014 Atlanta victory. The race was also the reason that the NASCAR sanctioning body eliminated the Overtime Line.\n\nOn August 20, 2017, Hendrick Motorsports announced that William Byron would take over the No. 5 in 2018, with Darian Grubb as crew chief. Twenty days later, the team changed the No. 5 to No. 24. Kahne ended up being locked into the Chase field in 2017 with his Brickyard 400 victory but wound up being eliminated after the first round and finishing 15th in the final point standings. The #5 did not run after the 2017 season.\n\nFollowing the 2017 season, the No. 24 car driven by Chase Elliott was renumbered to No. 9 in honor of Elliott's father, 1988 NASCAR Winston Cup Series champion Bill Elliott. After struggling through the first half of the 2018 season, Elliott scored his first stage win at New Hampshire. On August 5, Elliott scored his first NASCAR Cup Series win at Watkins Glen, giving Hendrick Motorsports its 250th race win and securing Elliott a Playoff spot. He added wins at Dover and Kansas during the Playoffs, and made it to the Round of 8 before a late crash at Phoenix effectively eliminated Elliott from championship contention. He finished the season sixth in points.\n\nElliott scored just two top 10 finishes in the first nine races of the 2019 season before reeling off five straight top 5 finishes, including his first career superspeedway win at Talladega. He later won at Watkins Glen for the second consecutive year. However, inconsistency, including six DNFs, plagued the team for the entire season. Elliott finished the season in 10th place, just ahead of teammates William Byron and Alex Bowman.\n\nPrior to the 2020 Pennzoil 400, car chief Matt Barndt was ejected after the No. 9 car twice failed pre-race inspection. Elliott won the first two stages of the race before hitting the wall and finishing 26th. \n\n\nThe No. 17 car at Hendrick Motorsports came about when Darrell Waltrip left Junior Johnson's team following the 1986 season in order to end his relationship with Budweiser. Waltrip chose to join Hendrick Motorsports with Tide as his sponsor and 17 as his car number. Waltrip won nine races in his first three seasons with Hendrick, including the Daytona 500 in 1989, a race that had eluded him for many years.\n\nWhile practicing for his 500th career start in the 1990 Pepsi 400 at Daytona, Waltrip's car spun in oil laid down by another car experiencing engine failure and was hit by Dave Marcis. Waltrip suffered a broken arm, a broken leg, and a concussion. He missed the Pepsi 400, but came back to run one lap at Pocono, before giving way to Jimmy Horton as a relief driver. After Pocono, Waltrip sat out the next five races due to his injuries. Despite missing six races, Waltrip finished 20th in driver points and the team finished 5th in owner points with substitute drivers taking turns in the car – Greg Sacks' second-place finish at Michigan, in August, was the best finish of the team's season. The team scored only one DNF for the season, when Sarel van der Merwe crashed late in the race at Watkins Glen. However, in the 23 races that Waltrip did start, he failed to win for the first time since 1974. At the end of the 1990 season, Waltrip decided he wanted to start his own team, so he left Hendrick Motorsports, taking the No. 17 with him. The Tide sponsorship moved to the flagship No. 5 team with Ricky Rudd as the driver and remained there until the end of the 1993 season.\n\nCar No. 25 was owned for many years by Rick Hendrick's father, Joe \"Papa\" Hendrick. It debuted in 1986 as HMS's second team, with a Folgers sponsorship and Tim Richmond driving. Richmond was teamed with veteran crew chief Harry Hyde, who moved over from the No. 5 team after chemistry issues with Geoff Bodine. Richmond won seven times that year and finished third in points. He missed the beginning of the 1987 season due to HIV/AIDS, while publicly saying he was suffering from pneumonia. Benny Parsons drove the first eleven races of the season, with the car renumbered 35; Darrell Waltrip was hired to drive Hendrick's third car at this time. Richmond returned midway through the season and won his first two races, at Pocono and Riverside. Following a blown engine at Michigan and deteriorating health, he left the ride after only eight starts. He died in August 1989.\n\nIn 1988, Ken Schrader took over the ride, winning the pole at the season opening Daytona 500. He won two pole positions, won the Talladega DieHard 500, and finished fifth in points. He won four more poles in 1989 and picked up a victory in the fall race at Charlotte. Kodiak replaced Folgers as the sponsor of the No. 25 for the 1990 season. Schrader failed to win a race in 1990, but he won the Daytona 500 pole for the third year in a row. He won two more races in 1991 and finished ninth in points. Schrader did not win again, but he finished a career-best fourth in points in 1994. After that year, Budweiser replaced Kodiak as the sponsor. Schrader left the team after the 1996 season and was replaced by Ricky Craven.\n\nCraven helped Hendrick complete a 1–2–3 finish in the 1997 Daytona 500 by finishing third behind winner Jeff Gordon and second-place Terry Labonte. After suffering a concussion at Texas, he missed two races. Jack Sprague and Todd Bodine filled in for him during the injury. The other highlight for Craven during the 1997 campaign was a Winston Open win. Craven ultimately finished nineteenth in points. In 1998, to honor NASCAR's fiftieth anniversary, the No. 25 car changed its number to 50 for the season. Shortly after the season started Craven, still feeling the effects from his concussion the year before, was diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome. Randy LaJoie and Wally Dallenbach, Jr. filled in while Craven recovered. Craven returned to driving at his home track, New Hampshire, and won the pole for the event, but after four more races Hendrick permanently replaced Craven with Dallenbach, who had put together the stronger run of the two substitute drivers.\n\nWith the team back to racing the No. 25 with Dallenbach behind the wheel, the team raced to an eighteenth-place finish in points 1999. However, Dallenbach left the team to drive for a new team and Budweiser moved over to sponsor Dale Earnhardt, Inc.'s No. 8 car in 2000 and the team needed to hire a replacement and find a sponsor. Homebuilder and television personality Michael Holigan came on to sponsor the car for 2000 and Hendrick hired driver Jerry Nadeau. Nadeau had most recently been driving for MB2 Motorsports as a replacement for a retired Ernie Irvan, who - due to injuries - was pulled out of NASCAR midway through 1999.\n\nNadeau had a solid first year with Hendrick, finishing twentieth in points and winning the season-ending race at Atlanta. The team returned for 2001 with UAW and Delphi as co-sponsors, and Nadeau finished a career high seventeenth in points while nearly repeating his Atlanta victory; Nadeau ran out of gas short of the finish and finished fifth. After eleven races in 2002, Nadeau was let go from the team.\n\nNadeau's replacement was Joe Nemechek, who had been released from Haas-Carter Motorsports after his team lost its sponsor Kmart due to bankruptcy and had spent much of the early part of the season substituting for an injured Johnny Benson, Jr. in the No. 10 car at MB2. Nemechek won at Richmond in 2003 but was let go before the end of the season so he could join MB2 Motorsports as the replacement for an injured Nadeau.\n\nNemechek's replacement in the No. 25 was Brian Vickers, who was initially supposed to drive the car beginning in 2004 while racing full-time in the Busch Series in 2003 (where he won the championship). UAW and Delphi did not return as sponsors after 2003, so Hendrick replaced them with GMAC Financial (Vickers' primary sponsor in Busch) and sister company Ditech.com. In spite of high expectations, Vickers finished third in Rookie of the Year standings behind Kasey Kahne and Brendan Gaughan. 2004 was a sad year for Vickers and the No. 25 team. \"Papa\" Joe, long-time owner of the No. 25 car, died in July, while Vickers' close friend Ricky Hendrick (the more recent owner of the 25) perished in a plane crash that also took the lives of nine others in October. Vickers improved to seventeenth in points in 2005. Midway through the 2006 campaign, Vickers announced he would leave Hendrick Motorsports at the end of the season.\n\nOn June 9, 2006 Hendrick Motorsports announced that Casey Mears of Chip Ganassi Racing would take the spot of Vickers in 2007. Vickers collected his first career win later that season at Talladega in a controversial finish, spinning out teammate Jimmie Johnson and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. to take the victory.\nIn 2007, the Army National Guard joined forces with longtime Hendrick Motorsports partner GMAC to sponsor the No. 25 Chevrolet driven by Casey Mears. Mears piloted the No. 25 to his first career win at Charlotte Motor Speedway in the Coca-Cola 600. After the season, Mears moved to the No. 5, while the fourth full-time ride was given to the new No. 88 for Dale Earnhardt, Jr., who replaced Kyle Busch at Hendrick Motorsports. This left the No. 25 as a part-time team.\n\nMaking his Cup Series debut at Texas Motor Speedway in the 2008 Dickies 500, JR Motorsports driver Brad Keselowski started 37th and finished 19th in the No. 25 GoDaddy-sponsored Chevrolet. Keselowski would go on to make limited appearances in the No. 25 in both 2008 and 2009 with the intent of eventually taking over the team's No. 5 car. However, after Mark Martin re-signed to continue driving the No. 5 car in 2010, Keselowski replaced David Stremme in the No. 12 car for Penske Racing late in the 2009 season (the ride he had been offered at the beginning of the season), leaving the Hendrick organization.\n\nThe No. 25 returned in 2011, being driven by Mark Martin in that year's Sprint All-Star Race while his usual No. 5 was being occupied by Jimmie Johnson. The Farmers Insurance Group-sponsored car sported a retro red paint scheme resembling the Budweiser and Folgers schemes run by the team in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn late 2014, it was announced that Nationwide Series Champion Chase Elliott would drive several races in a fifth Hendrick car in 2015, according to Hendrick Motorsports general manager Doug Duchardt. The car was officially announced as the No. 25 on January 29, 2015, and Elliott drove the car in five races with Xfinity Series sponsor NAPA Auto Parts, in preparation for taking over the No. 24 car in 2016.\n\nHendrick Motorsports' No. 48 team began Cup Series competition in 2001 when Hendrick signed Jimmie Johnson, a second-year Busch Series driver for Herzog-Jackson Motorsports. The team is co-owned by Hendrick and Jeff Gordon. Johnson made his debut at the fall Charlotte race, qualifying 15th and finishing 39th after crashing out. Johnson competed in two other races that year before moving to the Cup Series full-time in 2002. The No. 48 team took over old cars from the No. 24 team, which built new cars for the 2002 season. Johnson won three races and finished fifth in points, behind only Ryan Newman among rookies. He won three more races in 2003 and finished second in points.\nJohnson led the Cup Series in points for much of the 2004 season, and entered the first Chase for the Nextel Cup second behind Gordon. Johnson won four races during the Chase, but finished in second, just eight points behind Kurt Busch. Johnson again led the Cup Series in points for much of the 2005 season, but lost the points lead after a hard crash at the Brickyard 400, and finished the season fifth in points. Johnson scored his first Daytona 500 victory in 2006, despite crew chief Chad Knaus serving a four-race suspension for rules infractions. Johnson also won the All-Star Challenge, Brickyard 400, and his first Nextel Cup championship in 2006. Johnson won the championship again in 2007, winning 10 races, the most by a driver in a single season since Gordon won 13 in 1998. Hendrick Motorsports won 18 of 36 races in 2007, including four in a row during the Chase.\nJohnson tied Cale Yarborough's record by winning his third consecutive championship in 2008. In 2009, Johnson won seven races, had 16 top fives, and 24 top tens to become the first NASCAR driver to win four consecutive championships. Johnson eclipsed his own record in 2010 with his fifth straight title, finishing second in the final race of the season to pass Denny Hamlin in points.\n\nThe 2011 season's most memorable moment occurred at Talladega, when Johnson used a push from teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr. to beat Clint Bowyer by just .002 seconds, the closest finish in Cup Series history. However, Johnson failed to win a sixth consecutive championship, winning only two races, and his sixth-place points finish was the first time he finished outside the top five in his career. The No. 48 team's performance improved in 2012, winning five races, but late-season mishaps at Phoenix and Homestead relegated them to third in points.\n\nIn 2013, Johnson won his second Daytona 500 and fourth All-Star Race on his way to a sixth Cup Series championship. Johnson's 11th-place points finish in 2014, however, marked the first time he finished a season outside the top ten. Johnson won five races in 2015, but again struggled during the Chase and finished tenth. Johnson won four races on his way to his record-tying seventh championship in 2016, joining Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt.\nJohnson made the Playoffs in 2018 despite not winning a race, his 15th straight appearance in NASCAR's postseason. At the inaugural Charlotte Roval race, Johnson nearly overtook Martin Truex Jr. to win, but locked his brakes on the final turn and spun out both drivers. Ryan Blaney won the race, and the six spots Johnson lost as a result of the spin eliminated him from the Playoffs.\n\nOn March 14, 2018, Lowe's announced they would end their sponsorship of the No. 48 team after the season. To commemorate the longtime partnership, Johnson drove the No. 48 car with its original Lowe's paint scheme in the season-ending race at Homestead-Miami. Following the season, Kevin Meendering from JR Motorsports replaced Knaus as crew chief of Johnson's team, with Knaus moving to the No. 24 team in 2019. Ally Financial (formerly GMAC, a past Hendrick Motorsports sponsor) signed a two-year deal to sponsor the No. 48 team starting in 2019.\n\nMidway through 2019, following a string of disappointing finishes, race engineer Cliff Daniels replaced Meendering as crew chief of the No. 48. However, Johnson still failed to make the postseason for the first time since its inception in 2004, after a crash at Indianapolis knocked him out of Playoff contention. After the season, Ally agreed to extend its sponsorship of the No. 48 team through 2023. Johnson finished a career-worst 18th in points, registering only three top-five finishes the entire season.\n\nThe car debuted in 2002 as the No. 60 Haas Automation/NetZero-sponsored Chevrolet, fielded jointly between Hendrick and Gene Haas in preparation for Haas to field his own team, Haas CNC Racing. Hendrick driver Jack Sprague attempted six races (qualifying for three) with a best finish of 30th at Homestead Miami Speedway. While Haas and Sprague moved over to the No. 0 Pontiac, the No. 60 returned as a Hendrick R&D car in 2003 with test driver David Green and continued sponsorship from Haas and NetZero. Green attempted the four restrictor plate races (missing the first Daytona and Talladega races) with a best finish of 32nd. Brian Vickers made his Cup Series debut at the fall Charlotte race, finishing 33rd, before moving to the 25 car.<ref name=\"Motorsport-Vickers-60/25-2003\"></ref> The 60 was entered at the Homestead-Miami season-finale with Kyle Busch and Ditech.com, but withdrew.\n\n18-year-old Kyle Busch took over the car the following season, selecting the number 84 (reverse of No. 48) for the Carquest Chevy. He made his debut at his hometown track Las Vegas Motor Speedway and made five more starts that year with a best finish of twenty-fourth at California.\n\nIn 2005, Terry Labonte took over the car after he announced he became semi-retired; the number had been changed to No. 44, used by Labonte during his first championship season in 1984. Kyle Busch, meanwhile, moved to his No. 5 car full-time. Sponsored by Kellogg's, Pizza Hut, and GMAC/Ditech.com, Labonte drove the car in a limited schedule over the next two years. His final race with the team was at his native Texas Motor Speedway in November 2006, in a special commemorative paint scheme sponsored by longtime-partner Kellogg's. Though Labonte planned to retire following the race, he would race on a part-time or substitute basis until 2014.\n\nOn June 13, 2007, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. announced he would join Hendrick Motorsports for the 2008 season. On September 14, 2007 it was announced that he would drive the No. 88 car, after a deal with Robert Yates Racing that sent the No. 88 car to Hendrick Motorsports. The No. 88 replaced the No. 25, which scaled back to part-time. AMP Energy (owned by longtime Hendrick sponsor PepsiCo) and the National Guard (which had sponsored the No. 25) stepped up to sponsor the car. Earnhardt, Jr.'s crew chief and cousin, Tony Eury, Jr., also made the move to Hendrick Motorsports. However, this partnership only lasted until April 2009 when Tony Eury, Jr. was replaced by Lance McGrew, a technical advisor and part-time crew chief with HMS for the No. 25 car.\n\nAt the start of the 2011 season, Steve Letarte moved over from Jeff Gordon's team and became Earnhardt's crew chief. For 2012, PepsiCo decided to replace the struggling AMP Energy brand with the Diet Mountain Dew brand. The team won for the first time since 2008 and for the second consecutive year made the Chase, but Earnhardt suffered a concussion during an August Hollywood Casino 400 tire testing on the reconfigured Kansas Speedway, and was not tested for the concussion until the Good Sam Roadside Assistance 500 at Talladega, where he was involved in a second hard crash. After testing, Earnhardt was deemed medically unfit to race. Regan Smith, scheduled to drive for Phoenix Racing, instead drove the No. 88 at Charlotte and Kansas in what turned out to be a tryout that led to Smith joining Earnhardt's Xfinity team for 2013. Earnhardt returned at Martinsville and finished out the season.\nEarnhardt finished fifth in Cup Series points in 2013, after winning two poles (at Kentucky Speedway and Dover International Speedway), and posting five-second-place finishes.\n\nThe No. 88 returned to prominence in 2014 when Earnhardt won four races – the Daytona 500, both Pocono races, and the fall Martinsville race. Letarte joined NASCAR on NBC in 2015, and JR Motorsports crew chief Greg Ives was hired to replace him. On August 6 of that year, the National Guard decided not to renew their sponsorship with Earnhardt. They would be replaced by Nationwide Insurance, outgoing sponsor of the now-Xfinity Series and longtime sponsor of Earnhardt, for the 2015 season.\n\nLate in 2015, it was announced that Axalta Coating Systems, longtime sponsor of Hendrick's No. 24, would move to sponsor the No. 88 in 2016.\n\nIn 2016, concussion-like symptoms ended Earnhardt's season after Kentucky. His replacements were Alex Bowman and Jeff Gordon. 2017 marked Earnhardt Jr.'s final full-time season in Hendrick's No. 88 as he announced his retirement in April of that year.\n\nIt was announced on July 20, 2017 that Bowman would take over the No. 88 car for the 2018 season. Despite being winless, Bowman made the Playoffs until he was eliminated from the Round of 12 at the fall Kansas race.\n\nThe 2019 season saw improvement in Bowman's finishes, including three consecutive second-place finishes at Talladega, Dover, and Kansas. Bowman also made the starting grid of the 2019 Monster Energy NASCAR All-Star Race by winning the Fan Vote. It was announced on June 12, 2019, that Nationwide Insurance would not be sponsoring Hendrick Motorsports or the No. 88 after 2019, ending a five-year relationship prematurely. At the 2019 Camping World 400 at Chicagoland Speedway, Bowman held off a late charge from Kyle Larson to win his first career NASCAR Cup race.On June 13, 2019, Nationwide Insurance announced the end of their five-year sponsorship of the No. 88 after the 2019 season. On September 20, tool company Cincinnati Inc. signed a 10-year partnership deal with HMS, including primary sponsorship of the No. 88.He went to get eliminated after the Round Of 12 in the playoffs and finished 12th in the standings with one victory.\n\nThe 2020 Daytona 500 saw him finishing 24th after getting collected in multiple wrecks. Then, he was close to winning Las Vegas until he had to make a final stop and finished 13th. His luck finally came at Auto Club when he dominated the race, leading 110 laps to capture his 2nd career victory in the NASCAR Cup Series and his 1st win of the season. After that, he finished 14th at Phoenix.\n\nIn 1987, Benny Parsons drove for Hendrick's second team as a replacement for Tim Richmond. Hendrick kept the No. 25 available for Richmond to run a limited schedule, so Parsons drove the No. 35 car instead with Richmond's crew chief Harry Hyde. Parsons opened the year with a second-place finish at the Daytona 500. Parsons ended up running the entire season, with the team temporarily expanding to four teams when Richmond returned for eight races, and finished sixteenth in points with six top-fives and nine top-tens.\n\nIn 1993, Hendrick fielded a car numbered 46 for two races. The first race was that year's Daytona 500 as Al Unser, Jr. qualified for his only career NASCAR race in a Valvoline-sponsored car (Valvoline being his then-primary sponsor in the IndyCar Series). The second saw Buddy Baker fail to qualify a DuPont-sponsored car at Talladega in the spring.\n\nIn 1995, Hendrick fielded the No. 58 Racing for a Reason Chevrolet. The sponsor is a leukemia marrow sponsor founded by Rick Hendrick. The car was entered originally a safety car for Jeff Gordon to clinch his first championship. The No. 58 was driven by Jeff Purvis, as Gordon had to finish 41st or better in the 42 car field. Gordon clinched the championship by staying out on green flag pit stops. Purvis came in 26th place. The No. 58 would not return until 2001 as the No. 48 car.\n\nIn 1989 and 1990, Hendrick Motorsports served as a technical consultant during the filming of \"Days of Thunder\", including providing camera-equipped racecars to capture racing footage. The team prepared a total of 14 racecars for the filming. In-race footage was taken at the 1989 Autoworks 500 at Phoenix International Raceway, and the 1990 Daytona 500, in addition to stunt footage shot outside of NASCAR events. At each race, the cars would run 100 miles before start-and-parking. At Phoenix, Hendrick qualified two movie cars: the No. 46 City Chevrolet Lumina driven by Greg Sacks, and the No. 51 Exxon Lumina driven by Bobby Hamilton. An additional car, the No. 18 Hardee's Lumina driven by Tommy Ellis, failed to qualify. Though the cars were not intended to run competitively, Hamilton qualified fifth and led five laps before pulling off the track. Sacks would run the 46 in the Busch Clash exhibition race at Daytona in early 1990, finishing second in one of the movie cars. After the incident at Phoenix, the two cars fielded at the Daytona 500 with Ellis (No. 18 Hardee's Lumina) and Hamilton (No. 51 Mello Yello Lumina) were not officially scored.\n\nFollowing the production of the film, Sacks continued to drive for Hendrick's research and development team on a part-time basis in 1990. Sacks attempted two races (1 DNQ) in the No. 46, twelve in the No. 18 with sponsorship from Ultra Slim Fast, and three in the No. 17 as a substitute for Darrell Waltrip. Sacks earned a second-place finish at Talladega in May, and a pole at Daytona in July. The team was shut down and Sacks released at the end of the year, due to Slim Fast ending its sponsorship.\n\nHendrick Motorsports fielded in-house entries in the Busch Series from 1984 to 1990, and again from 2000 to 2007, primarily the No. 5 entry. Following the conclusion of the 2007 racing season, Hendrick and JR Motorsports (owned by Hendrick driver Dale Earnhardt, Jr.) officially combined Xfinity Series operations. The No. 5 Chevrolets began running full-time under the JR Motorsports banner in 2008, and the team receives engines and technical support from Hendrick Motorsports, with several HMS employees moving to JR Motorsports. Rick Hendrick continues to be listed as car owner of the No. 5 team. JRM and HMS also collaborate in the areas of partnership development, sponsorship services, marketing and media relations.\n\nHendrick began running in the Busch Series in its debut season of 1984, fielding a No. 15 Chevrolet for 16 races, with Cup Series driver Geoffrey Bodine running 12. Between 1985 and 1990, HMS fielded two cars (numbered 5 and 15) on a part-basis, with several drivers including Bodine, Ken Schrader, Greg Sacks, Rob Moroso and owner Rick Hendrick himself.\n\nThe current No. 5 car debuted as the No. 14 in 2000, with Rick Hendrick's son Ricky Hendrick running the season finale at Homestead-Miami, finishing 39th after a crash. The car went full-time in 2002 as the 5 with the younger Hendrick driving. However, Ricky was injured in the third race of the season in a wreck at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Ron Hornaday would take over for him for the next six races, before Hendrick returned at Richmond. Towards the end of the season, Hendrick suddenly announced his retirement from driving due to lingering effects from the crash, but would remain on board as a team car owner until his 2004 death. David Green finished out the season for the team.\n\n19-year-old Brian Vickers was hired to drive the 5 car in 2003, handpicked by Ricky Hendrick. Vickers won three races and the Busch Series championship, beating Hendrick test driver and coach and former No. 5 car spotter David Green.\n\nWhen Vickers moved up to NEXTEL Cup, Kyle Busch became the team's new driver after running seven races the previous season. In his rookie year, he won five races and was runner-up to Martin Truex, Jr. in points. He moved up to Cup as well after the season, but he continued to drive the 5 part-time. Mexican driver Adrian Fernández drove the car in six races in 2005, finishing tenth at Mexico City, but did not have another top-ten finish that season. Hendrick development drivers Blake Feese, Boston Reid, and Kyle Krisiloff also drove the car, running a total of eighteen races with best finishes of twenty-third, seventeenth, and nineteenth, respectively. Busch and Jimmie Johnson ran the rest of the schedule with Busch winning at Lowe's Motor Speedway. He drove 30 races in 2006, winning at Bristol and finishing seventh in points. He skipped the race at Memphis Motorsports Park, being replaced by Justin Labonte for that race.\n\nIn 2007, Busch and Mark Martin shared the No. 5 on a part-time basis, running 26 races. Landon Cassill, Casey Mears, and Adrian Fernandez also drove select events. The car carried a number of different sponsors including Lowe's, Delphi, Spectrum, and Hendrick Autoguard. Kyle Busch drove the car to victory lane in the rain delayed Daytona, Richmond, and Kansas.\n\nThe team moved to the JR Motorsports shop for 2008, as Johnson, Earnhardt, Casey Mears, Mark Martin and Landon Cassill split the car that season, as well as Martin Truex, Jr., Ron Fellows, and Adrian Fernandez in one-race deals. This car was sponsored by Lowe's, Delphi, the National Guard, and GoDaddy.com.\n\nIn 2009, the No. 5 car would be reduced to a part-time schedule due to the lack of sponsorship. Fastenal, Unilever and GoDaddy.com would sponsor the car with Cassill, Truex, Jr., Earnhardt, Jr., Martin, Tony Stewart, Ryan Newman and Scott Wimmer also drove the car. The car would remain inactive save for limited appearances by Dale Jr.\n\nThe No. 24 was started in 1999 as Gordon-Evernham Motorsports, owned by Jeff Gordon and crew chief Ray Evernham. Gordon and Ricky Hendrick shared the ride in 10 races. In 2000, HMS owner Rick Hendrick bought out Evernham's share, renaming the team to JG Motorsports. Gordon and Ricky Hendrick once again shared the ride, with Hendrick running 15 events. The team also formed an alliance with Cicci-Welliver Racing.\n\nHendrick Motorsports took full control of the team in 2001, with GMAC Financial Services sponsoring the No. 24 Chevrolet. Ricky Hendrick made three starts in the car, his best finish coming at Kentucky Speedway where he finished 15th. He and truck series teammate Jack Sprague moved up to the Busch Series full-time for 2002, with Hendrick moving to the No. 5 car.\n\nSprague ran the full 2002 season in the No. 24 with Truck Series sponsor NetZero scoring three poles and a win at Nashville Superspeedway en route to a fifth-place points finish. Sprague would move to Hendrick-affiliated Haas CNC Racing for 2003.\n\nThe 24 car returned in 2005 as the No. 57. The number came from the sponsorship of H.J. Heinz brand Ore-Ida, representing Heinz's 57 varieties. Brian Vickers ran the car in five races with Pizza Hut and Ore-Ida sponsorship, debuting the car at Darlington. He qualified second but finished forty-third after an early wreck. His best finish in the car came at Dover, where he finished fifth. Kyle Busch drove the car in an additional four races with Lowe's sponsorship, finishing in the top-five once. Boston Reid also drove the car once at IRP, finishing 23rd. Vickers returned for eight races in 2006, not finishing any higher than 23rd. Adrian Fernandez drove at Mexico City and Watkins Glen, finishing twelfth and seventeenth, respectively. In 2006 Brian Vickers ran eight races and the No. 57 had a new part-time sponsor in Mountain Dew with the full-time sponsor remaining Ore-Ida for the other five races. Mountain Dew was the full-time sponsor for three races in 2006 at Fontana, Darlington and Michigan with 9th, 12th, and 16th the finishes respectively. Vickers' best finish in 2006 was a second at Daytona in July.\n\nAfter Vickers' departure from Hendrick Motorsports, the team changed back to the 24 with Casey Mears and the U.S. National Guard coming on board for a limited schedule. Adrian Fernandez and Landon Cassill also shared the ride. This team did not run in 2008.\n\nThe 48 car made its debut in the Busch Series in 2004 at Charlotte Motor Speedway (then called Lowe's Motor Speedway), running a one-race deal with sponsorship from Lowe's and The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. Jimmie Johnson drove it to a third-place finish. He drove the car for five races in 2005, winning a pole at Lowe's. During 2006, he started three races, both Lowe's races and the Ameriquest 300 at California. His best finish was seventh in the first Lowe's race. Johnson drove the 48 car in the same three Busch races for the 2007 races, with a best finish of fourth at California.\n\nIn 2009, Hendrick Motorsports announced that they would run a No. 80 HendrickCars.com Chevy driven by Tony Stewart in the Xfinity Series Camping World 300 at Daytona. The number 80 represented the number of affiliates in the Hendrick Automotive Group. Stewart won the race in this car, with this being his only race for Hendrick Motorsports while focusing on his own team in a partnership with Gene Haas. Stewart-Haas Racing, at the time, received engines, chassis, and technical support from Hendrick Motorsports.\n\nIn 2003, 18-year-old development driver Kyle Busch made his entry into Busch Series, driving a No. 87 car in seven races in an alliance with NEMCO Motorsports (owned by then-Hendrick driver Joe Nemechek). The car received sponsorship from GMAC company Ditech.com, and Busch scored three top tens including two-second-place finishes.\n\nFor 2004, the alliance with NEMCO continued. Development drivers Blake Feese and Boston Reid ran 3 races each in the No. 87 ditech.com Chevy, with a best finish of 26th by Reid at Atlanta Motor Speedway.\n\n\nThe No. 17 Craftsman Truck Series team made its debut in 2000 with Ricky Hendrick driving with GMAC/Quaker State sponsorship. He made six races that season and finished in the top-ten four times. In 2001, Hendrick won his only career Truck race at Kansas Speedway, becoming the youngest driver at the time to win a truck race at age 21. He finished sixth in points, runner-up to Travis Kvapil for Rookie of the Year honors. The team did not run after 2001.\n\nThe 24 truck debuted with the Truck Series in 1995 with Scott Lagasse Sr. driving and DuPont sponsoring. Lagasse posted two top-fives and finished ninth in the standings. The team also fielded the 25 Budweiser Chevrolet part-time with Hendrick Sr. and Roger Mears driving. Midway through the season, Jack Sprague came on board to finish out the season for the team, winning a pole at Phoenix International Raceway. In 1996, he moved to the 24 full-time with Quaker State sponsoring. He won five races and was second in the points. The following season, he won three times and clinched his first NASCAR championship.\n\nThe team lost the Quaker State sponsorship after 1997, but signed GMAC Financial as a sponsor after a one-race deal with Big Daddy's BBQ Sauce. He won an additional five races, but lost the championship by three points. In 1999, Sprague won the championship again but fell to fifth in 2000. In 2001, NetZero came on board as the team's sponsor, and Sprague won his third championship. After Sprague moved his ride to the Busch Series, Ron Hornaday drove the 24 in a one-race deal at Daytona, finishing twelfth. The team closed after that race to focus on its Busch Series efforts.\n\nHendrick Motorsports revived its truck program in 2013, fielding a part-time entry for Chase Elliott. The team was sponsored by Aaron's and ran nine races. The trucks were not built directly by Hendrick Motorsports, but were instead provided by Hendrick-affiliated Turner Scott Motorsports. However, the trucks were fielded directly by Hendrick, with crew chief Lance McGrew. Elliott made his debut at Martinsville Speedway on April 6 and finished in the sixth position. Elliott became the youngest pole winner in Truck Series history at Bristol in August, and later the youngest race winner in the Truck Series by winning the inaugural Chevrolet Silverado 250 at Canadian Tire Motorsports Park. Elliott departed the No. 94 to join JR Motorsports in the Nationwide Series in 2014.\nHendrick fielded cars for five ARCA races from 1985 to 1996, twice for Brett Bodine in 1985 and 1986 (who won the pole for both races), and once each for Tommy Ellis (1988), Jack Sprague (1996), and Rick Hendrick himself. Rick Hendrick drove the No. 15 Tide car at Heartland Park Topeka in 1991, starting third and finishing 23rd after a braking issue in his only career ARCA start. In February 2000, Ricky Hendrick made his Daytona stock car in the ARCA Bondo/Mar-Hyde Series, driving the 17 GMAC Financial Services Chevrloet to a fifth-place finish. Hendrick would run the race again the next year in the renumbered 71 car, finishing 9th.\n\nIn 2012, Hendrick began fielding a number 9 Chevrolet for development driver Chase Elliott, with father Bill Elliott as the listed owner and sponsorship from Aaron's, Inc. Longtime HMS crew chief Lance McGrew served as the team's crew chief. Elliott made his debut at age 16 at Mobile International Speedway, scoring a pole and six top tens in six races.\n\nElliott returned to the team in 2013, scoring his first career win at Pocono Raceway. Elliott, at age 17, became the youngest superspeedway winner in ARCA Racing Series history, beating fellow 17-year-old Erik Jones. Elliott scored four tops tens, including the win at Pocono, in five races in 2013.\n\nElliott ran the 2014 ARCA season opener at Daytona, in order to gain NASCAR approval to run the Nationwide Series race the next week. Sponsored by HendrickCars.com and NAPA Brakes, Elliott was involved in a 15-car crash on the 13th lap. In spite of that, Elliott finished 9th, and NASCAR approved him to run on superspeedways; he would go on to win the Nationwide Series Championship.\n\nIn 2003, Hendrick fielded Kyle Busch in the ARCA RE/MAX Series for a total of seven races. Busch drove the No. 87 Ditech.com Chevrolet (the same car he drove in his Busch Series starts) to three poles and two wins. Busch ran the 2004 season opener at Daytona, starting second and finishing first.\n\nFor the rest of 2004, development drivers Blake Feese, Boston Reid, and Kyle Krisiloff ran a combined ten races in ARCA in the No. 5, No. 6, and No. 7 cars fielded by Bobby Gerhart Racing. Feese scored a win at Nashville, while Krisiloff scored a victory at Chicagoland Speedway. Later that season, Feese ran a single race in the No. 94 Carquest Auto Parts Chevy out of the Hendrick stable at Talladega, scoring the victory.\n\nKyle Krisiloff ran the No. 7 Bobby Gerhart Racing Chevy in 14 races in 2005, with sponsorship from Ditech.com and Delphi. Krisiloff scored 3 top fives and five top tens. Blake Feese also ran the Daytona season opener in the 94 car, and was involved in a pit road crash that injured four photographers.\n\nIn 2007, Hendrick Motorsports resurrected the No. 87 for development driver Landon Cassill, with sponsorship from Stanley Tools. Cassill attempted three races (failing to qualify at Talladega) with two top ten starts but finishes of 38th at Kentucky and 32nd at Pocono. Cassill and Stanley would move to the 88 under the JR Motorsports banner for 2008.\n2003\n2004\n2013\n\nOn October 24, 2004, ten people associated with Hendrick Motorsports lost their lives in a plane crash while en route from Concord, North Carolina, to a small airport near the Martinsville Speedway. The plane crashed in heavy fog into Bull Mountain, seven miles (11 km) from the Blue Ridge Airport in Stuart, Virginia, after a failed attempt to land.\nTen people aboard the Beechcraft King Air 200 died. Six were Hendrick family members and/or Hendrick Motorsports employees:\nJohn Hendrick, the owner's brother and president of Hendrick Motorsports;\nJeff Turner, general manager of Hendrick Motorsports;\nRicky Hendrick, a Hendrick Motorsports driver and its owner's son;\nKimberly and Jennifer Hendrick, John Hendrick's twin daughters; and\nRandy Dorton, chief engine builder.\nAlso dead were the plane's pilots, Richard Tracy and Elizabeth Morrison, Joe Jackson, director of the DuPont Motorsports program, and Scott Lathram, who worked for Joe Gibbs Racing as a helicopter pilot.\n\nNASCAR officials learned of the crash during that day's Subway 500 race in Martinsville, Virginia; they withheld the information from drivers until the end of the race, which was won by Hendrick driver Jimmie Johnson. For the rest of the 2004 season, all Hendrick Motorsports cars and the No. 0 Haas CNC Racing car featured pictures of the crash victims on the hood, accompanied by the phrase \"Always in our hearts\".\n\n"}

Jane was from West Country English stock and John's lineage was Irish in origin. The original Gaelic form of the name was O'Dulchaointigh and his forebears belonged to a sept of the O'Carroll clan situated in the province of Munster, Ireland.\n\nAt the age of 21, Robert Dulhunty arrived in the Colony of New South Wales as a free settler on the ship \"Guildford\". The date of his arrival was 5 March 1824. He was accompanied on the voyage from England by his brother, Lawrence Vance Dulhunty – a qualified surveyor with a sharp mind but a much less appealing manner than Robert's.\n\nSydney was just 36 years old at the time of the Dulhunty's arrival. It was still essentially a penal outpost operating under the decidedly non-democratic control of the then Governor of NSW, Sir Thomas Brisbane. The economy of NSW was based overwhelmingly on sheep grazing, other types of livestock production and the growing of various crops – with some additional income generated through whaling and sealing. Infrastructure projects were funded by the British Government and by the revenue reaped locally from taxes, including the collection of customs and excise duties levied on alcoholic spirits, tobacco and a wide range of imported goods. The colony possessed only a comparatively small contingent of skilled artisans, so convict iron-gangs were used perforce to build such necessary structures as roads, drains, bridges, wharves and fortifications, as well as public buildings of all kinds. Convicts quarried stone, too, and made bricks, felled trees and cleared paddocks. The more trustworthy of them were also assigned by the government to private landholders to work as agrarian labourers, shepherds or domestic servants.\nOn 23 March 1824, Robert Dulhunty applied for a grant of Crown land. This was at a time when the colony's hinterland was being opened up increasingly to responsible citizens for farming and grazing purposes. The governor accordingly granted him legal title to 2000 acres (eight km²) of land which he had selected previously at Cullen Bullen. In addition, Dulhunty was allocated six convict servants/labourers who were to assist him with the task of making the property a viable enterprise.\n\nIn 1826, Robert's father Dr John Dulhunty settled with his wife on a parcel of rural land at Burwood, which was situated 12 kilometres west of the port's mercantile and governmental core. Two years later, Dr Dulhunty was appointed to the salaried position of Superintendent of Police by the Governor of NSW. The governor had been impressed by the cool-headed bravery that he displayed when bushrangers attacked his residence, Burwood House. Dr Dulhunty's health declined unexpectedly in the wake of his police appointment, however, and he died at Burwood House in 1828.\n\nRobert Dulhunty's land grant marked the beginning of his rise through the ranks of colonial society. On 4 July 1828, Dulhunty requested a ticket of occupation from the NSW Surveyor-General, Sir Thomas Mitchell. He was rather brusquely informed by Sir Thomas on 10 July that the government had, for some time, discontinued giving tickets of occupation. Sir Thomas, however, would become a friend of Dulhunty's in the coming years.\n\nBy the end of the 1820s, Dulhunty was living mainly at Claremont House in the Mulgoa Valley, not far from the Nepean River. Sometime between 1829 and 1833, he set out from the nearby township of Penrith with an escort of about 40 Aborigines. Crossing the rugged Great Dividing Range, he followed the Macquarie River down to what is now known as Dubbo. This area had not been occupied by any Europeans when the explorer Captain Charles Sturt traversed the Macquarie in 1829.\n\nWhen surveyor Robert Dixon passed through Dubbo to survey the Bogan River in 1833, he mentioned that he had borrowed a dray from Dulhunty. It is therefore believed that Dulhunty took up the land which he named \"Dubbo\" in 1832.\n\nGovernor Sir Ralph Darling had created a zone known as the \"limits of location\" on 5 September 1826. Settlers were only allowed to take up land within this zone. A further government order, issued on 14 October 1829, increased the zone of approved settlement so that it now included an area called the 'Nineteen Counties'. Anyone who occupied land outside of this area were technically considered to be a 'squatter', without legal title. Among these squatters were many of the leading citizens of the colony, including Dulhunty.\n\nIn 1836, Dulhunty was listed as a founding member of Sydney's elite Australian Club, the first meeting of which was held in October that year. The club's 86 members included such prominent citizens as W.C. Wentworth, Sir John Jamison, Captain John Piper, Dr William Bland, Major Edmund Lockyer, James Macarthur, William Lithgow and John Blaxland.\n\nDulhunty's marriage took place at the Anglican Church of St James, central Sydney, on 29 April 1837. His bride, Eliza Julia Gibbes (1811-1892), was the English-born eldest daughter of Major (later Colonel) John George Nathaniel Gibbes. Colonel Gibbes (1787-1873) was a Member of the NSW Legislative Council and the Collector of Customs for NSW – a vital revenue-raising task that he would perform for the colonial government from 1834 until 1859. (The Colonel was also reputed to be the bastard son of Frederick, Duke of York, the second son of King George III)\n\nDulhunty and his wife held their wedding party on Sydney's Point Piper, where the Gibbes family lived. They honeymooned, however, near Penrith, at a Georgian mansion known as Regentville House. The mansion belonged to Sir John Jamison and stood at the heart of the knight's showpiece agricultural estate on the Nepean River. Dulhunty and Sir John knew each other well and Mrs Dulhunty's younger brother, William John Gibbes, was about to marry Sir John's eldest daughter.\n\nNot long after Dulhunty's wedding, he and Colonel Gibbes narrowly escaped being murdered by a pair of armed robbers while they were travelling in a carriage from the Sydney Customs House to a private engagement. Dulhunty was driving the carriage and their route took them along Parramatta Road. According to contemporary newspaper reports, when they reached a toll gate located near what is now the site of Sydney University they were ambushed by the two thugs, each of whom was brandishing a single-shot pistol. The thugs got angry when their victims refused to hand over their valuables and they made ready to shoot them. Luckily, however, it had been raining that afternoon, and the damp gunpowder in the thugs' pistols fizzled when the triggers were pulled. Dulhunty then slashed at the thugs with his horsewhip, and he and Colonel Gibbes were able to speed away to safety in their carriage. The police subsequently searched the area and interviewed informants but the perpetrators of the crime were never caught. Their appearance and distinctive way of speaking, as described by Dulhunty and Colonel Gibbes, led the investigating officers to conclude that they were English sailors who had probably come ashore from a ship moored in Blackwattle Bay.\n\nDulhunty and his wife, Eliza Julia Dulhunty (née Gibbes), had six sons and three daughters, the last three children being born in Dubbo. They were:\n\n\nAnother child, Emily, died as an infant in 1839 and lies buried at St Thomas' Churchyard, Mulgoa.\n\nDulhunty, on 5 December 1837, was made the police magistrate for the Penrith District. He also took out a licence for 'Dubbo Station' in that same year. \nOn 10 December 1840, Dulhunty accepted an appointment to serve on the Committee of the Australian Immigration Association. During the early 1840s, Dulhunty – along with E. Blaxland and R.C. Lethbridge – served the Penrith District as a local councillor, with Dulhunty's brother-in-law, William John Gibbes, acting in his spare time as the district's equivalent of a town or shire clerk. Gibbes was now managing the Regentville estate for his father-in-law, Sir John Jamison, who was in poor health. Gibbes and Dulhunty became close friends during this time. They shared a love of books, good food and horse-riding, and they both accepted positions as honorary stewards at Sir John's private racecourse. When Sir John died in 1844, Dulhunty and Mrs Dulhunty attended his funeral in Penrith.\nBy 1839, 28 free men and 18 government-assigned male convicts had gone to work for Dulhunty on Dubbo station. Dulhunty\"s reputation among the working men of the region was that of a fine bushman, a firm but fair-minded boss and an extremely able landed proprietor. Unlike some other squatters of this era, he rarely had his convict labourers flogged by their overseers when they transgressed. \nDulhunty reached the zenith of his wealth in 1839–1840, when he is listed as the owner of half-a-dozen big grazing properties throughout NSW. Unfortunately, however, a severe economic depression struck the colony in the early 1840s, costing him a significant amount of money and forcing him to shed numerous assets. This crisis lasted for several years. He survived it but many of his coevals in NSW did not, as wool prices fell, banks failed, investment schemes collapsed and bankruptcies soared.\n\nJust before the depression hit, Dulhunty had erected a large, brick and timber homestead at Dubbo Station. Claremont, however, would remain his headquarters until 1847, in which year he decided to move permanently to Dubbo with his wife and children. This relocation proved to be an arduous logistical exercise for the Dulhuntys, who had to transport dray-loads of furniture and other belongings across rough mountain roads and along rutted bush tracks in sometimes hostile weather conditions.\nIn 1849, a village was laid out at Dubbo and gazetted as a residential and commercial settlement. Henceforth, Dulhunty's landed estate, situated nearby, would become known as \"Old Dubbo\". The following year, convict transportation to NSW ceased, while the discovery of gold in NSW and Victoria during the early 1850s would transform the hitherto agricultural-based economies of these two neighbouring colonies and help attract free immigrants to Australia in unprecedented numbers.\n\nRobert Venour Dulhunty died on Friday, 30 December 1853, after suffering for three days from an illness that is not identified on his death certificate. His brick-lined grave lies in the Dubbo Pioneers' Cemetery, which is situated on former Dulhunty land amidst a patchwork of paddocks and enclaves of bush. He was aged only 51 at the time of his passing.\n\nHis widow Eliza fought a resolute but ultimately losing battle to hold together the Dulhunty's sprawling rural kingdom in the face of droughts, floods, outbreaks of livestock diseases, harsh bank foreclosures and various other setbacks – and all the while being saddled with the additional responsibility of raising a large tribe of children to maturity. Those who knew her said she never lost her vibrant sense of humour, cultivated manners or deep interest in music and literature, no matter how serious the latest problem besetting her.\nMrs Dulhunty never remarried. During the 1870s, she lived with one of her sons, Hubert Dulhunty, on a small rural property near Wellington, New South Wales. Later, when she grew frail with age and was handicapped by deteriorating eyesight, she moved to the town of Bathurst. Here she was looked after by another of her sons – John, a commission agent.\nMrs Dulhunty died at Bathurst Hospital on 13 February 1892, having outlived her husband \"Bob\" by almost 40 years. The \"Bulletin\" magazine, which was read widely by people in rural areas, published a brief but sympathetic obituary when informed of her death. She is buried in Old Bathurst Cemetery. Her headstone is still extant and photographs of her exist. Regrettably, no image of Robert Venour Dulhunty has been traced.\n\n\n"}

She is best known for being the lead singer of Dutch symphonic metal band Epica, where she joined at the age of seventeen, releasing seven studio albums and touring the world. In her singing career, she has also collaborated with bands such as Kamelot, Leaves' Eyes, Primal Fear, Ayreon, and Angra.\n\nSimons was born in Hoensbroek, Netherlands. She has a younger sister named Janneke who was born on Simone's second birthday. Simons cited her musical influences as Lacuna Coil, Nightwish, Tristania, Kamelot, Within Temptation, Dimmu Borgir, Tiamat, and some classical music such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\n\nSimons started playing flute for two years after joining music school at the age of 12. At 14, she had one year of pop singing lessons, and at 15, she switched to classical singing after listening to Nightwish's \"Oceanborn\", which remains her favorite Nightwish album. At one point she was invited to join in a rehearsal for a black metal band; she joined it, although was a little afraid to sing. Simons sang in a choir for a few months, and later joined Epica at the age of 17.\n\nIn early 2002, Mark Jansen left After Forever over creative differences. He then began looking for musicians who would work towards a more classical/symphonic type of music project; this was initially named \"Sahara Dust\". In late 2002, the band courted Helena Michaelsen (from Trail of Tears) as its frontwoman, but shortly after she was replaced by the then unknown Simons, who was Jansen's girlfriend at the time.\n\nIn January 2008, Simons was suffering from recurrent MRSA infections. This forced Epica to cancel many of their shows. In February, her condition improved, but she had not completely recovered. In March, Epica toured with Amanda Somerville, replacing Simons for their United States tour until May 11, 2008, when Simons performed again at their show in Bibelot, Dordrecht.\n\nAsked about her looks as one of the factors that attract attention to Epica, Simons said: \"First of all the most important is the sound of the band, because beauty will fade one day, and I hope my voice won't [Laughs]... But, yeah, you have two aspects of the band – the music (the CD's) and then the live side of it (the show), and part of the show is also that it has to look nice, so I take good care of myself, I make sure that the fans have something to look at during the show.\"\n\nSimons and long-time partner, Kamelot keyboard player Oliver Palotai have a son, Vincent Palotai, born on October 2, 2013. In December 2013, Simons announced on her blog that she had recently married Palotai. They reside in Stuttgart, Germany. In the past, she had a relationship with Mark Jansen.\n\nSimons runs a blog called \"SmoonStyle\", where she writes about her fashion, makeup, food and experiences she has had as a member of Epica, as well as in her personal life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is 58 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Penrith and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region.\n\nEmu Plains is on the western side of the Nepean River, located at the foot of the Blue Mountains.\n\nPrior to European settlement, what is now Emu Plains was on the border of the Western Sydney-based Darug people and the Southern Highlands-based Gandangara people, whose land extended into the Blue Mountains. The local Darug people were known as the Mulgoa who lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle governed by traditional laws, which had their origins in the Dreamtime. They lived in huts made of bark called 'gunyahs', hunted kangaroos and emus for meat, and gathered yams, berries and other native plants.\n\nThe first British explorers to visit the area surveyed Emu Plains in August 1790 led by Watkin Tench, and named it Emu Island after emus they sighted on the land and in the mistaken belief that the land was actually on an island in the Nepean River. It was first referred to by its current name by Governor Lachlan Macquarie on 15 April 1814, when he toured the island also realising that it was not an island but a plain that occasionally flooded giving the appearance of an island. When William Cox started building his road over the Blue Mountains from there, The Cox's Road started work at Emu plains on 18 July 1814. A government farm with convict labour was established in 1813 with 1326 convicts working on growing local agriculture. It closed down in 1833 and the land was Gazetted and sold to establishment the village of Emu Plains.\n\n\"Emu Ferry\" Post Office opened on 1 April 1863 and was renamed \"Emu Plains\" in 1882.\n\nThe removal of river-stones from the Nepean River for concrete and road-base was begun by the Emu and Prospect Gravel and Road Metal Company in the 1880s. A railway siding, which was to be ultimately expanded into a short branch, was first laid in from the Main Western Line at Emu Plains in 1884. Railway operations, which included their own locomotives, continued until 1967, after when only a siding, shunted by Government trains, remained. All railway operations ceased in 1993.\n\nEmu Plains has a number of landmark buildings:\n\nThe main commercial centre is Lennox Village (formerly Centro Lennox), named after David Lennox is a shopping centre that features Aldi and Woolworths.\n\nEmu Plains railway station is situated on the T1 (North Shore, Northern & Western Line) of the Sydney Trains network. It is the last station on the suburban line with Lapstone, the next station to the west, considered part of the Intercity network. While a long distance from Sydney city, there are many express services from Emu Plains to the city. Emu Plains is also serviced by Blue Mountains Transit.\n\nEmu Plains can easily be accessed from Penrith via the Great Western Highway. Access from further east is best obtained by the M4 Western Motorway. If travelling east from the Blue Mountains, access is best obtained by the Great Western Highway.\n\nThe local government primary school is Emu Plains Public School and the high school is Nepean Creative and Performing Arts High School. There is also a Catholic primary school, Our Lady of the Way, and high school, McCarthy Catholic College.\n\nPenrith Regional Gallery & The Lewers Bequest is an art gallery established at the former property of artists Gerald and Margo Lewers. It is at 86 River Road Emu Plains. The property was bought by the Lewers in the 1940s and in 1950 it became their permanent home and studio. Gerald died in 1962 and Margo continued to live and work there until her death in 1978. In 1980 the Lewers' daughters donated the site, buildings, gardens and a substantial collection of art to Penrith City Council. The Gallery was opened in August 1981 by the New South Wales Premier, Neville Wran. Every year tens of thousands of visitors inspect the gallery’s exhibitions and use the gardens and café.\n\nEmu Plains has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\nThe Parish of St Paul’s Emu Plains was formed and the Church School licensed on 8 November 1848. The first resident rector was appointed in 1856 and the church building consecrated on 16 August 1872. The chancel was added to the original building about 1887. The original rectory and most of the church records were lost on 4 January 1929 in a bushfire.\n\nAt the time of the centenary of the church in 1948, the parish was responsible also for branch churches Christ Church Castlereagh and St Thomas’ Cranebrook, and later also included St David’s Llandilo. In more recent times these branch churches have become linked with the parish of Cambridge Park, and Emu Plains has become a single-church parish.\n\nApart from the original church building, the property currently consists of the Parish Centre (with hall, offices, resource centre, kitchen) built in 1991, two timber two-room Classrooms, a staff residence built in 1969 and a second worker’s home located in Beach Street.\n\nThey have a traditional Anglican service at 8am followed at 9.30am with a contemporary service for all ages that is particularly popular with younger families. Then at night they have a 6:30 Church is a casual and contemporary meeting popular with young and old, students and workers, singles and families.\n\nOur Lady of the Way is a part of the Catholic Diocese of Parramatta in Western Sydney. Rev Robert Anderson served between 2004-2014. As of 2015 and onwards, Rev Mick O'Callaghan is the current priest however has not been confirmed due to the absence of a Bishop in the diocese. They have mass at 8am & 9.30am every Sunday. church website\n\n\nBy 2004, the church had grown to the extent that they were able to call its first full-time Pastor. Rev. Steve Turnbull commenced his ministry with Emu Plains Community Baptist Church in February of that year and concluded at the end of October 2010.\n\nThe services were initially held in the Emu Plains Community Centre, which served the congregation well until the growing numbers meant that the space was no longer sufficient. On 23 October 2005, the services were moved just down the road to Melrose Hall which meets at 9.35am on Sundays\n\nAt the 2016 census, there were 8,421 residents in Emu Plains. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 3.6% of the population. 79.8% of residents were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 5.1%, New Zealand 1.4%, Scotland 0.7%, Netherlands 0.6% and Philippines 0.5%. The top responses for religious affiliation were Catholic 29.1%, Anglican 23.4% and No Religion 21.0%. The top ancestries were Australian 29.1%, English 28.8%, Irish 10.2%, Scottish 6.9% and German 2.4%. 87.3% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Greek 0.9%, Arabic 0.5%, Croatian 0.4%, Macedonian 0.3% and Italian 0.3%.\n\n\nUntil 1963, Emu Plains was part of Blue Mountains City Council but was then transferred to Penrith City Council, where it is currently split between the North and South Wards. At the state level, it is part of the Electoral district of Penrith, represented by Liberal Stuart Ayres. Federally, it is part of the Division of Lindsay, represented by the Australian Labor Party's Emma Husar.\n\n\n\n"}

The Governor of New South Wales is the vice-regal patron of the Society.\n\nThe Society was established as the Philosophical Society of Australasia on 27 June 1821. In 1850, after a period of informal activity, the Society was revived and its name became the Australian Philosophical Society and, in 1856, the Philosophical Society of New South Wales. The Society was granted Royal Assent on 12 December 1866 and at that time was renamed the Royal Society of New South Wales.\n\nMembership is open to any person interested in the promotion of studies in Science, Art, Literature and Philosophy. Fellowship and Distinguished Fellowship are by election, and may be conferred on leaders in their fields. The Society is based in Sydney and has an active branches in Mittagong in the Southern Highlands of NSW. Regular monthly meetings and public lectures are well attended by both members and visitors.\n\nThe Society publishes a peer-reviewed journal, the \"Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales\", the second-oldest peer-reviewed publication in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nThe Royal Society of New South Wales, Australia traces its origins to the Philosophical Society of Australasia, established on 27 June 1821 and was the first scientific society in the then British Colony of New South Wales.\n\nThe Society was formed \"with a view to enquiring into the various branches of physical science of this vast continent and its adjacent regions\". On his arrival in Sydney late in 1821, the newly appointed Governor, Sir Thomas Brisbane, was offered and accepted the position of President.\n\nFollowing a period of informal activity, the Society was revitalised (led by Dr Henry Douglass, one of the original founders) and renamed the Australian Philosophical Society on 19 January 1850. The society was renamed the \"Philosophical Society of New South Wales\" in 1856. On 12 December 1866, Queen Victoria granted Royal Assent to change its name to \"The Royal Society of New South Wales\". The Society was incorporated by Act of the New South Wales Parliament in 1881.\n\nThe rules of the Society provided that the Governor of New South Wales should be President \"ex officio\". After the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, the Governor-General became Patron of the Society, and the Governor New South Wales the Vice-Patron. From 1938 to 2014, the Society was under the joint patronage of the Governor-General of Australia and the Governor of NSW. The Society now has a single Vice-Regal Patron, the Governor of NSW.\n\nThroughout its history, the Society has done much to foster local research particularly in science, through meetings, symposia, publications and international scientific exchange, and has supported and fostered the endeavours of other organisations dedicated to the furtherance of knowledge.\n\nThe Society encourages \"... \"studies and investigations in Science, Art, Literature and Philosophy, to promote and further the development of Science and its relationship with Art, Literature and Philosophy and their allied disciplines and applications, to facilitate the exchange of information and ideas amongst the Members and Fellows of the Society and others on these and kindred topics and to disseminate knowledge to the people of New South Wales and beyond \"...\" through the following activities:\n\nThe Society's journal, the \"Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales\" is one of the oldest peer-reviewed publications in the Southern Hemisphere. Much innovative research of the 19th and early 20th centuries (e.g. Lawrence Hargrave's work on flight) was first brought to the attention of the scientific world through the \"Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales\". In the last few decades specialist journals have become preferred for highly technical work but the Journal and Proceedings remains an important publication for multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary work.\n\nThe Journal and Proceedings are exchanged with hundreds of institutions worldwide. Issues are published June and December each year.\n\nThe Society welcomes scholarly work to be considered for publication in the Journal. Preference is given to work done in Australia which has relevance to New South Wales. Intending authors must read the style guide, available via the Society's web site (Journal), before submitting their manuscript for review.\n\nThe Society recognises outstanding contributions to science, art, literature or philosophy with the position of Distinguished Fellow. Distinguished Fellows of the Society are entitled to use the postnominal \"Dist FRSN\". There can be up to 25 Distinguished Fellows at any one time.\n\n\nThe society makes a number of awards for meritorious contributions in the field of science.\n\nThe Clarke Medal is awarded by the Society for distinguished work in the Natural sciences. It was named in honour of the Reverend William Branwhite Clarke, one of the founders of the Society. The medal was to be \"\"awarded for meritorious contributions to Geology, Mineralogy and Natural History of Australasia, to be open to men of science, whether resident in Australasia or elsewhere\"\". The Medal is now awarded annually for distinguished work in the natural sciences (geology, botany and zoology) done in the Australian Commonwealth and its territories. Each discipline is considered every three years. For a complete list of medalists see Clarke Medal.\n\nThe Edgeworth David Medal, established in 1942, is awarded for distinguished contributions by a young scientists under the age of thirty-five years for work done mainly in Australia or its territories or contributing to Australian science. It is named after the geologist, Sir Edgeworth David, FRS, who wrote the first comprehensive record of the geology of Australia.\n\nThe James Cook Medal, established in 1947, is awarded periodically for outstanding contributions to science and human welfare in and for the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nFrom 1850 to 1880, the President of the Society was the Governor of New South Wales.

{"id": "2089814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089814", "title": "Askeladden", "text": "Askeladden\n\nAshlad (Norwegian \"Askeladden\", full name \"Esben Askelad\" or \"Espen Askeladd\") is a main character in a number of tales collected in Asbjørnsen and Moe's \"Norwegian Folktales\".\n\nThe character starts out being regarded as an incapable underachiever, but eventually proves himself by overcoming some prodigious deed, succeeding where all others have failed.\n\nThe character's name appeared as Boots in Dasent's 19th century English translations.\n\nThe name \"Askeladden\" (meaning 'ash-lad') or \"Askeladd\" is the standard form which Asbjørnsen and Moe eventually settled for. However, the storytellers used this alongside other variant names such as Askefis, sometimes interchangeably within the same tale.\n\nIn fact, the most frequently recorded original name was \"\" or \"Askefis\", glossed as a person who blows on the coal to stoke the fire. The latter word is attested since the 15th century, in proverbs. This would make sense, as the job of blowing on the embers was often assigned to the person of the household who was considered the least fit for other, more demanding chores – typically a fragile grandmother or a small child.\n\nBut because the editors felt Askefis to be too rustic, they favored the name Akeladden (or altered it to Askepot) which seemed more refined. This adulteration was derided by P. A. Munch as overly prim and lacking courage. In Asbjørnsens's first edition (1843), the name appears as \"\", which in Norway is commonly associated with Cinderella. The name was changed to Askeladden in the second edition, but strangely enough, in the first tale (\"About Askeladden who Stole from the Troll\"), the name Askepot was still retained in the narrative itself.\n\nThe form Esben Askepot was later changed to Esben Askelad in the second edition by Asbjørnsen and Moe, then later to Espen Askeladd by Moltke Moe\n\nAskelad or Askeladd (without the indefinite article -en suffix) are Danized, or Dano-Norwegian forms. The Norwegian form Oske-ladd is composed of 'ash' and 'hair sock' (related to 'hairy, shaggy'), with the explanation that ashes allowed to cling to the feet seem like furry socks.\n\nA more conjectural etymology hypothesizes the second part to be related to \"lodden\" meaning \"blow gently\", which conforms with the idea behind the name Askefis, of a person who blows on the embers to enliven the fire.\n\nAs for Esben Oskelad, Esben is said to be a variant of Esbern, cognate to the Norse name Asbjørn and English name Osborn. \n\nAskeladd/Oskeladd has been rendered into English as \"Cinderlad\" (or \"Ash-Lad\"), this does fails to accurately reflect the meaning as outlined above.\n\nGeorge Webbe Dasent chose to translate the name (Askefis, Askepot) as \"Boots\", which was criticized as a \"disenchanting rendering\" of \"Cinderson\" by \"The Athenaeum\" literary magazine, but defended as \"aptly styled\" by Scottish folklorist W. A. Clouston. Dasent was well aware of cognate names in Scots English dialects, such as \"Ashiepattle\" and \"Ashypet\". Dasent says he coined the name \"Boots\" as representative of the tradition in English households that the youngster of the family were expected to perform the meanest chores. He fails to elaborate more than this, but \"boots\" is glossed as \"the servant at an inn who pulls off and cleans the boots of travellers\" in a dictionary from the Victorian Era. \n\nAskeladden is characterized as the runt of the family, being \"the youngest, smallest, and weakest\", Yet \"clever, bold, patient\", and against all odds, eventually successful. The hero has great rewards in store, often the princess's hand in marriage and half the kingdom.\n\nHowever, as Jan Brunvald has noted, there is somewhat of a gap between the Askeladden in the actual folktales, and the national hero and symbol of every countryman () to which he has been elevated by the Norwegian populace.\n\nIn the folktales, by all accounts, Askeladden remains near the hearth and idly \"roots about\", but according to Norwegian sources, he is forced by his family to sit in the ashes in the hearth.\n\nThe character is also closely related to the common and quite nationalistic jokes of the three Scandinavian archetypes, the Norwegian, the Swede and the Dane. In those jokes, the Norwegian always succeeds in petty contests where the others do not. The jokes resemble the fairy-tale pattern and are mostly told by Norwegian children. Here, one can interpret the Norwegian as the youngest and underdog brother of the three, a parallel to the historical facts of Norway's position in Scandinavia.\n\nAskeladden is the protagonist in numerous folk tales:\n\n\n\nIn many folk tales, the Ash Lad is portrayed as the youngest of three brothers. Early in a typical tale, the older brothers appear to have much greater chances of success in life. For example, one brother might be extremely well read, whereas another might be extremely competent in another area. In contrast, the Ash Lad is looked down upon as a seemingly drowsy ne'er do well, perhaps even as a loner or misunderstood eccentric, who spends too much time sitting by the fireplace lost in thought as he is poking the ashes.\n\nAs the typical story unfolds, the oldest brothers try first to heroically overcome some major crisis or problem. As an example, one tale involves rescuing a princess held captive in a land \"East of the Sun and West of the Moon\". The two older brothers, who are tied to conventional thinking, typically fall flat on their faces. In contrast, it is the Ash Lad who comes up with creative solutions. He is smarter, more tactical, more receptive and more aware of the needs of others. He outwits trolls, dodges charging unicorns or gets a magic Viking ship to transport him (similar to an also-popular folk tale, \"The Fool and the Flying Ship\") where he ultimately saves the princess.\n\nThe \"heroic\" trait of the character is probably most prominent in the stories told by Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe. The tales they collected present the \"classical\" Ash Lad. In other stories, collected by others, the character and his brothers are presented as mere scoundrels, even thieves. Those stories present the youngest brother as the one with the wits about him, and thus, he gets away with the loot. They always steal from the wealthy farmers or even the king, similar to the fabled Robin Hood. Those stories are documented from Vest-Agder, in their time the poorest parts of Norway, where suppression was common. Thus, the Ash Lad has some similarities with the Norwegian crime writer (1791–1849).\n\nThe origin of the Askeladden character has been sought by some scholars in the old Norse god Loki, in his aspect as a fire \"vættir\".\n\nIn the \"Peer and Paul and Esben Askelad\" the father does not own even the shirt on his back, and tells his sons to make their fortune in the world. There is a variant collected by the NFS () where the father says he only has ragged skin trousers for clothes to provide, and sends out his sons to the world. To this has been found an Irish counterpart \"Adventures of Gilla na Chreck an Gour\" (recté \"Adventure of [\"an\"] \"Giolla an Chroicinn Gabhair\"\" or 'The Fellow with the Goat-skin'), which is an ash-lad tale in which the woman provides the boy kept around the hearth with a goat-skin to wrap around the waist.\n\nIt has been observed that Henrik Ibsen's play \"Peer Gynt\" draws from Norwegian folklore, with some portions in particular owing to Askeladden tales. Albert Morey Sturtevant argued that Ibsen's almost proverbial phrase,\n\nwhich express the notion that one may never know the usefulness of seemingly trifling things until it is tested, derived from \"Per, Pål og Espen Askeladd\" (where Esben and Espen Askeladd are equivalent). But contested the choice of tale, and instead favored \"Spurningen\", for in that story Askeladden not merely finds trifling things, but his finds included a dead magpie, like Ibsen's verse (A variant of \"Spurningen\" was published later, entitled \"Prinsessen som ingen kunne målbinde\", and is also an alternative strong candidate).\n\n\n\n"}

Clarke and Stephen Baxter. It is the second book in the series \"A Time Odyssey\". The books in this series are often likened to the \"Space Odyssey\" series, although the \"Time Odyssey\" novels ostensibly deal with time where the \"Space Odyssey\" novels dealt with space. The first book in the series was \"Time's Eye\".\n\n\"Sunstorm\" opens with the last chapter of \"Time's Eye\" as its initial chapter, and Bisesa Dutt is in London, reunited with her daughter. It is 9 June 2037, the day after her helicopter was shot down in the North Western Frontier Province of Pakistan. The five years that she spent on Mir, an alternate Earth, are now only memories (though the fact that her body has aged five years since 8 June 2037, will eventually serve as some confirmation of her story).\n\nIn the meantime, a major solar event occurs on 9 June, disrupting virtually all of the Earth's electronic hardware. Dramatic as it is, this phenomenon is only a minor precursor of a far more massive solar eruption about five years off. Scientific models of the projected 2042 event make clear that the Earth will be sterilised completely by the upcoming solar burst. The effects will be so powerful as to even endanger astronauts on Mars.\n\nRather than sit by and allow the sun to just destroy all of Earth's life, political leaders (most notably the President of the Eurasian Union, Miriam Grec), and scientific leaders (led by Siobhan McGorran, the Astronomer Royal) decide to embark upon an ambitious plan to literally shield Earth from the worst effects of the storm. The plot is further complicated when information from Bisesa's odyssey suggests that what is happening to the sun is not simply a random happening in nature, but is rather the result of events set in motion by an alien intelligence over three millennia ago. Known as the Firstborn—since they were the first alien race to reach sentience, and thus are the most advanced civilization in existence in the universe—they are determined to stop later lifeforms from across the galaxy from infiltrating the stars, where they would increase entropy with energy usage and eventual wars, thus hastening the Universe's eventual heat death.\n\nJust as in \"Time's Eye\", Baxter and Clarke pay small homage to \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" with lines lifted from the earlier book.\n"}

Several countries have at different times nationalized part or all of their railway system.\n\nMore recently, the international trend has been towards privatization. In some areas, notably Great Britain, resultant problems with track maintenance have led back to a more mixed solution, with a nationalised infrastructure operator but privately run train operating companies.\n\nNational characteristics influenced the structures under which countries' rail networks developed. Some national railways were always under direct State management, some were State-planned but privately operated (as in France, others were wholly private enterprises lightly regulated (as in Great Britain, Ireland and Spain). Nationalization was therefore a bolder step to take in some countries than in others. While ideology has played a role, so too has the need for systematic reconstruction of vital infrastructure devastated by war, often following a period of State control over private companies initiated during the conflict.\n\nRailroads in the Russian Empire were built by both the state and capitalists. After communist takeover the whole railway system was brought under the state control and remained being so after fall of the communist rule. Nowadays the Russian Railways state-owned company holds monopoly on this sphere of transportation.\n\nThe Argentine railways developed with private British, Argentine and French capital and were nationalised by the state in 1948 during President Juan Perón's first term of office and merged into the existing state-owned railways. In the 1990s, following Carlos Menem's neoliberal reforms, services were privatised through concession with infrastructure still belonging to the state. After a series of high-profile accidents and serious deterioration of services under privatisation, most rail lines have returned to state control by 2015, in effect re-nationalising them.\n\nIn Canada, the government took control of several railways that fell into bankruptcy following World War I, including the Canadian Northern Railway, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, and the Grand Trunk Railway. On December 20, 1918, the federal government created the Canadian National Railways (CNR), and placed the companies that it took control of under the CNR. Canadian National Railway was privatized in 1995.\n\nIn 1878, the French government took over ten small failing railway companies and established the Chemin de fer de l'État. The company absorbed the Chemins de Fer de l'Ouest in 1908.\nIn 1938, the French state took 51% ownership of the newly formed SNCF merging of France's five main railways (100% in 1982).\n\nThe earliest railways in the German states were often run by private entrepreneurs. Beginning in 1879, the Prussian government nationalized the major railways. After World War I, the German Reich took over control of the state railways of Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, Württemberg, Baden, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Hesse and Oldenburg. The individual railways were merged into the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft in February 1924. The DRG was the largest publicly owned company in the world when the Nazis privatised it in 1937. In the lead up to, and during, World War II the DR assimilated a great number of railway companies in the German-occupied territories as well as several smaller, previously privately owned lines in Germany.\n\nPost-World War II, after being under Allied administration between 1945 and 1949, the DR was split up into the Deutsche Bundesbahn and Deutsche Reichsbahn of the GDR, both state-owned. Private railways continued to exist in the West German realm of the DB, but DB and DR accounted for most of the rail traffic in post-war Germany. After German reunification, DB and DR became Deutsche Bahn AG in 1994.\n\nWhilst DB AG is a public limited company, all its shares are presently owned by the government of the Federal Republic of Germany. DB AG is now facing stiff competition in the freight and short-distance passenger sector (the latter of which is subject to franchising), although they still hold a quasi-monopoly in the long-distance passenger sector (which does not receive subsidies), which was starting to crack until the opening of the long distance bus market destroyed the business case of any open access competition. The IPO, originally planned for 2008, has been postponed indefinitely and is currently not on the agenda of any major political party.\n\nIndian Railways has been state owned since 1951.\n\nIn Ireland Córas Iompair Éireann was formed from the merger of the Great Southern Railways with the Dublin United Transport Company on 1 January 1945. Initially a private company limited by shares, CIÉ was nationalized in 1950. The final privately owned mainline railway company on the island, the Great Northern Railway, was nationalized under joint control of the Irish and Northern Irish governments in 1953. It was wound up in 1958 and its assets split between CIÉ and the UTA.\n\nFollowing unification, the Italian Government entrusted the railways to five regional concessionaires. The arrangement did not work well and, long before it was due to expire, the railways were nationalized in 1905. The nationalized operator is known as Ferrovie dello Stato. Italy has an open access high-speed rail operator competing against the national railway; Nuovo Trasporto Viaggiatori which is part owned by SNCF and private investors.\n\nIn Japan, the Railway Nationalization Act of 1906 brought most of the country's private railway lines under public control. Between 1906 and 1907, of track were purchased from seventeen private railway companies. The national railway network grew to about of track, and private railways were relegated to providing local and regional services. In the 1980s the process of privatizing Japanese National Railways begun that is not entirely finished as of 2016 with both entirely state and private members of the JR Group.\n\nAfter years of declining profitability, the national rail network was devastated by the Spanish Civil War. In 1941, the broad gauge railways were nationalized, as RENFE. The narrow gauge railways were also later nationalized; some of these have since been transferred to the autonomous regional governments where contained within a single region. The standard gauge high-speed lines were built as a state owned venture from the start.\n\nIn 1914, the railways were taken into Government control due to World War I, but were returned to the original owners in 1921, three years after the war had ended. However, in that same year, the government introduced the Railways Act 1921. This forced the 120 railway companies then operating to merge into just four. This grouping officially took place on 1 January 1923. The four railway companies formed from the grouping were: The Great Western Railway, the Southern Railway, the London and North Eastern Railway, and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. In Britain during World War II, the railways were taken into State control. They were heavily damaged by enemy attacks and were run down aiding the war effort. After the war, the Transport Act 1947 provided for nationalizing the four major railways. On January 1, 1948, the railways were nationalized and British Railways was created, under the overall management of the British Transport Commission, later the British Railways Board.\n\nBritish Rail was privatised between 1994 and 1997, involving the transfer to a series of private-sector operators of responsibility for the provision of services under contract. In all, more than 100 companies took over from British Rail. In 2001 the track operator Railtrack went bankrupt; it was reconstituted and renamed as Network Rail, a private company with no legal owner but effectively government-controlled via its constitution and financing. The United Kingdom government continues to invest in the railways, financing, for example, the acquisition of some InterCity rolling stock.\n\nThe positive impact of privatization is disputed, with passengers numbers more than doubling (see graph) and increasing customer satisfaction balanced with worries about the level of rail subsidies and criticism of the fact that much of the system is now contracted out to subsidiaries owned by the state owned railways of France, Germany and the Netherlands.\n\nOnly 20% of Southern trains arrived on time in the year from April 2015 to March 2016, and there was an ongoing industrial dispute over driver-only operated trains. In June 2016, amongst criticism of the performance of its services, Go-Ahead warned of lower than anticipated profits on its Govia Thameslink Railway franchises, leading to 18% drop in the Go-Ahead share price.\n\nRailways in Northern Ireland were nationalized in the 1940s under the Ulster Transport Authority (UTA). The former LMS lines managed by the Northern Counties Committee, nationalized by the Westminster government, were sold to the UTA by the British Transport Commission in 1949. Unlike British Rail, the Northern Ireland Railways remain state owned.\n\nAfter the United States entered World War I in 1917, the country's railways proved inadequate to the task of supplying the nation's war effort. On 26 December 1917, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson nationalized most American railways under the Federal Possession and Control Act, creating the United States Railroad Administration (USRA). \n\nIt took control of the railways on 28 December 1917, and introduced several reforms to increase efficiency and reduce costs. It standardized rolling stock and steam locomotive designs. The war ended in 1918.\n\nIn March 1920, control of the railways was returned to their original owners. Freight operations and most of the track have remained private enterprises, even as the railroads were forced to restructure by changing markets in the post-World War II years. \n\nDue to changes in transportation after the construction of the interstate highway system in the postwar years and shift to trucking, railroads in the late 20th century went through widespread restructuring and reduction. Passenger traffic particularly had declined as more families owned and used private automobiles. Under President Richard Nixon, Amtrak was established to try to continue passenger operations by using existing tracks. It has been subsidized in order to continue service to some areas that had no alternative transportation, as well as to relieve congested roadways in more dense areas, as on the Northeast corridor. Amtrak subsequently bought some tracks from bankrupt railways as well as Conrail.\n\n"}

Its western terminus is located at the Turcot Interchange, a junction with Autoroute 15 and Autoroute 20, and its eastern terminus is near the Jacques Cartier Bridge (Route 134), where the highway merges with Notre-Dame Street. The Autoroute Ville-Marie designation is named after the downtown borough of Ville-Marie, through which the expressway is routed.\n\nPart of A-720 runs underground (below grade) through Downtown Montreal. This section begins from the west at Rue de la Montagne / Rue Atwater (exit 4) and remains underground almost all the way to its eastern end, except for a short section between Rue Saint-Urbain and Rue Hôtel-de-Ville . The tunnelled section west of this gap is known as the Ville-Marie Tunnel, and the section east of it is known as Viger Tunnel. However, locals regard both tunnels as one, and the term \"Ville-Marie Tunnel\" is often used to refer to both tunnels.\n\nThe Turcot Interchange, which is the western terminus of A-720, is currently undergoing a reconstruction project. Once completed, the A-720 will be downgraded from an autoroute to a national highway and renumbered Route 136.\n\nIt was originally envisioned that Autoroute 20 would extend from the Turcot Interchange, along the route of the 720, to the Louis Hippolyte Lafontaine Bridge-Tunnel. Indeed, when the first section of the expressway was constructed and opened in the early 1970s, many Montrealers, anticipating that it would eventually replace the Metropolitan Expressway as the primary connector route to the Lafontaine Tunnel, and onward to Quebec City, dubbed the then-unnamed roadway the \"Downtown Trans-Canada Highway\". The provincial transport ministry (Le ministère des Transports du Québec, or MTQ) had planned to extend the Viger Tunnel east to Autoroute 25 at its Souligny Avenue interchange. The right-of-way has existed since the original layout of the A-720, and buildings along the extension were demolished at that time, even though the 720 was not completed due to cost constraints. The government of Montreal instead converted the portion of Rue Notre Dame east of the Jacques Cartier Bridge into a six-lane \"urban boulevard\", rather than continue a sunken limited-access expressway. The final project was approved, and work began on Souligny Avenue to double the span of the travel lanes. In late July 2009, an A-720 westbound shield that was installed on this stretch. \nIn 2007, working crews for Transports Québec discovered major cracks in a support pillar and closed several lanes of the expressway. Transports Quebec announced on August 10, 2007, major repair projects for a large section of the Expressway west of the Ville-Marie tunnel. In addition, the full reconstruction of the Turcot Interchange in the next several years will also affect portions of the 720. As of 2012, the 720 will be renamed Route 136 at the end of the reconstruction, which is due to be late 2019.\n\nOn July 31, 2011, part of the roof of the Ville-Marie Tunnel collapsed, sending large chunks of concrete to the road below. This incident occurred at a time with little traffic and no vehicles were damaged. Several construction workers were on site at the time and were unharmed. The tunnel had to be closed for repair of the roof and several other parts of the tunnel. Transport Minister Sam Hamad announced on Friday, August 5 that the tunnel would re-open the following day.\n\n"}

His date of birth is disputed but it was sometime between 1928 and 1932. He is a member of the Alabama Gang.\n\nHis first race was at Opa-locka Speedway near Miami, Florida in a 1934 Ford in 1948. He became famous as a member of the Alabama Gang and he considered his hometown to be Hueytown, Alabama. Estimates of Farmer's career victories range from 700 to 900 victories, most occurring in the late 1950s and early 60's. He raced 36 NASCAR races from 1953 to 1975. He won numerous championships at local tracks. He was the NASCAR National Late Model Sportsman champion (later Nationwide Series) for three consecutive years from 1969 to 1971. Farmer's best finish in NASCAR's top division was a fourth at both the 1972 Talladega 500, and the 1968 Middle Georgia 500 near Macon, Georgia). He had so few Cup races because he was content to run primarily in the Late Model Sportsman. He was named NASCAR's most popular driver 4 times. Farmer later raced in the white and gold No. 97 car. In the mid 60's, however, Farmer raced a white, gold, and red Ford Fairlane, No. F-97.\n\nHe was Davey Allison's crew chief in the Busch Series.\n\nFarmer has retained his skills as a driver in spite of his age. He competed in two Busch Grand National races in 1992, and the season opening ARCA event at Daytona in 1993. On June 2005, Farmer, nearly aged 80, turned heads in winning a heat over current NASCAR Sprint Cup stars, and finished 8th in the feature during the Sprint Prelude to the Dream at Eldora Speedway, owned by Tony Stewart.\n\nAs of 2015, Farmer still regularly competes in a late model at Talladega Short Track, a 1/3 mile oval dirt track in Eastaboga, Alabama located near the Talladega Superspeedway. His Grandson, Lee Burdett, also races there.\n\nHis accolades are numerous, being a member of five halls of fame. Farmer was named one of the 50 Greatest Drivers in NASCAR history in 1998. He was a member of the first Class of Inductees into the Talladega-Texaco Walk Of Fame. When the International Motorsports Hall of Fame inducted Farmer, they had to waive their rule of 5 years of retirement – they figured he never would retire.\n\nThe International Motorsports Hall of Fame lists his birthyear as 1928, but other sources list his birthdate as October 15, 1932. He was asked by stockcarracing.com: \"You've been coy about your age over the years. I've read that you were born in 1928, 1929, or maybe even 1930 or 1931. What year was it?\" Farmer replied: \"Hey, I ain't sure. When I was born I was too young to read the birth certificate.\" The interviewer followed up with \"We'll just go with 1928, how's that?\" Farmer replied: \"There is so many that I can't even figure it out. I ain't even sure myself anymore.\"\n\nOn July 12, 1993, Farmer was a passenger in a helicopter crash at Talladega Superspeedway that took the life of NASCAR Winston Cup driver Davey Allison, which occurred as Allison was attempting to land the aircraft in a nearby parking lot. The two were en route to the track in order to watch David Bonnett (son of fellow Alabama Gang driver Neil Bonnett) drive in a practice session. Farmer suffered a broken collarbone and fractured ribs in the crash, and was at the time of Allison's death in critical but stable condition.\n\n"}

He was raised in England where he attended Harrow and Trinity College (Cambridge University). He was from a Baghdadi Jewish family who had made their fortune in the opium business. The family also had large holdings in the Indian cotton industry. Sir Victor served in the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War. He survived a plane crash in 1916 and sustained leg injuries that plagued him for the rest of his life. When his father died in 1924, Victor inherited his title and became 3rd Baronet of Bombay. He moved to India, where he managed his family's textile mills and served in the Indian Legislative Assembly.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, he transferred much of his wealth from India to Shanghai, China and contributed to a real estate boom there by investing millions of US dollars in the local economy. Sir Victor frequently traveled worldwide for business and pleasure and divided his time between Poona, India and Shanghai. He acquired the Cathay Land Company, the Cathay Hotel Company and at least 50 other companies. Sassoon built the Cathay Hotel (now the Peace Hotel) in 1929, and other large hotels, office buildings and residences, many in The Bund, a waterfront area in central Shanghai (including Hamilton House, Metropole Hotel and Embankment). At one time, he owned over 1,800 properties there. Sassoon endeavored to protect Western interests in the Orient and helped European Jews survive in the Shanghai Ghetto.\n\nSir Victor Sassoon loved photography and opened a studio in Shimla first called Hamilton Studios. In 1928 he established his hobby and opened a studio in Bombay State at Ballard Estate by the same name as Hamilton Studios at E.D.Sassoon Building (one of his property), Ballard Estate, and all the negatives from Shimla were brought here, to Bombay, closing down that studio completely.He was also fond of horse racing, Chinese ivories, international friendships and travel. He counted members of the aristocracy and such Hollywood stars as Charlie Chaplin, Marlene Dietrich, Basil Rathbone and Bette Davis among his acquaintances. An accomplished photographer, he made many images of friends, and of local and foreign landscapes and created numerous photograph albums. He also illustrated his diaries with his own photographs.\n\nHe lived in Shanghai until 1941, when due to China's war with Japan, he was forced to leave. After the Chinese Communist Revolution of 1949, he sold his business interests in China and relocated to Nassau, Bahamas.\n\nDuring the 1950s Sassoon lived at his home on Cable Beach in Nassau. Late in life he married his American nurse, Evelyn Barnes (\"Barnsie\"), who remained in Nassau long after Sassoon's death in 1961. Lady Sassoon continued to provide support for the charity founded by her late husband to help Bahamian children, by hosting the black-tie Heart Ball each year over the Valentine's Day weekend.\n\nOn the death of his father in 1924, Sir Victor Sassoon inherited the trading house \"E.D. Sassoon & Co. Limited\". Set up in 1867, it had offices in Bombay (India) and Shanghai (China) and interests in Persian Gulf ports, Baghdad and Japan. The Company ran cotton mills in India and invested in property in the Far East. In 1928 Sir Victor Sassoon established the \"E.D. Sassoon Banking Company Limited\" as a subsidiary of \"E. D. Sassoon and Company Limited\", to coordinate the trading interests of his family.\n\nIn March 1930 E.D. Sassoon and Company Limited's new headquarters were opened at \"Sassoon House\" in Shanghai. The Second World War brought many changes to the E.D. Sassoon Group. Despite successful production rates, the firm decided to dispose of the mills in Bombay in 1943, fearing problems as foreign owners once independence was granted. In May 1949 Shanghai was under the control of a communist regime and seemed an unhealthy place for the company's head office, so this was transferred to Nassau in the Bahamas in 1950. It is thought that Nassau was chosen because there were no forms of personal or corporation tax in place and Sir Victor Sassoon planned to live there, which he did until his death in 1961.\n\n\"E.D. Sassoon Banking Company Limited\" was bought by the merchant bank \"Wallace Brothers and Company (Holding)\" in 1972, which in turn was taken over by the Standard Chartered Bank in 1976. The other parts of the \"Sassoon Group\" and the \"Sir Victor Sassoon Heart Foundation\", set up by Lady Sassoon after her husband's death, are run from Nassau, where the family still lives.\n\nA fan of thoroughbred horse racing, Sir Victor Sassoon owned a highly successful stable of horses that won numerous prestigious races in the United Kingdom. In 1925 he purchased the Bungalow Stud, founded 1851 in Cambridgeshire not far from the Newmarket Racecourse. He renamed it Eve Stud Ltd. as he was known to his intimates as 'Eve'- a contraction of his first two names, Ellice Victor. The mastermind behind Sir Victor's racing success in Britain was trainer Sir Noel Murless who became manager of Eve Stud in 1952.\n\nHe purchased the property from Sir Victor's widow in 1970 and gave it the name \"Woodditton Stud\". Sir Noel continued the practice of standing stallions there, including the top-class racehorses Connaught and Welsh Pageant. The stallion tradition was maintained when the stud was purchased again in 1981 by Mr Yong Nam-Seng of Singapore, being home to Damister and, for a short time, his champion son Celtic Swing, as well as Bin Ajwaad, Superlative and Sayf el Arab. After 20 years of ownership, during which time he expanded the stud to 185 acres, Mr Yong Nam-Seng, a steward of the Singapore Jockey Club and former chairman of the Australasian Racing Conference, sold Woodditton Stud in November 2001 to its present owner Darley Stud Management and it is now used as a rest and recuperation facility.\n\nSassoon purchased Beech House Stud from Martin H. Benson in 1960 and along with Eve Stud it became part of Sassoon Studs Incorporated managed by Murless. Sassoon's wife sold the Sassoon Studs to Louis Freedman in 1971.\n\nAmong Sir Victor Sassoons stables' significant performances were wins in The Derby (Pinza, Crepello, Hard Ridden, St. Paddy) Epsom Oaks, 1,000 Guineas, 2,000 Guineas, St. Leger Stakes, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes.\n\nOn the death of his father Edward Elias Sassoon in 1924, Sir Victor Sassoon became the 3rd Baronet of Bombay. Late in life, in 1959, he married his American nurse, Evelyn Barnes (\"Barnsie\"). He had no issue and the baronetcy became extinct.\n\nHe was related by marriage to the Mocatta family and he himself was a Sephardic Jew. One of his former employees, Lawrence Kadoorie (later the Lord Kadoorie), later founded the Hong Kong-based utility company China Light and Power. One of his right-hand men in Shanghai was Gordon Currie who was put into a concentration camp by the Japanese and remained there for several years.\n\n\n\n"}

The name refers to a mystical island, visible on the horizon but not reachable, and was originally inspired by the sight of Ambae island from neighboring Espiritu Santo in Vanuatu, where author James Michener was stationed in World War II.\n\nIn the musical, Bali Ha'i is a volcanic island within sight of the island on which most of the action takes place. The troops think of Bali Ha’i as an exotic paradise, but it is off-limits—except to officers. The matriarch of Bali Ha'i, Bloody Mary, conducts much business with the troops, and she meets Lt. Joseph Cable soon after he arrives. She sings to him her mysterious song \"Bali Ha'i\", with its haunting orchestral accompaniment, because she wants to entice him to visit her island. She doesn’t tell him that she wants him to meet, and fall in love with, her young daughter, Liat.\n\nSeveral commentators have noted that the opening melody of \"Bali Ha'i\" bears a resemblance to the \"bride motif\" in Franz Waxman's musical score for the 1935 film \"Bride of Frankenstein\". The two melodies share an identical three-note pattern.\n\nSeveral versions of the showtune made the bestsellers list in 1949. Perry Como's version was the most successful at #5. Other versions appearing on the charts were by Paul Weston and his Orchestra (#10), Bing Crosby (recorded March 10, 1949) (#12), Peggy Lee (#13), and Frank Sinatra (#18). Later, Harry James released a version on his 1955 album, \"Jazz Session\" (Columbia CL 669); Andy Williams released a version on his 1958 album, \"Andy Williams Sings Rodgers and Hammerstein\"; and Sergio Franchi included this song on his 1965 RCA Victor tribute to \"The Songs of Richard Rodgers\".\n\n\"Bali Ha'i\" was based on the real island of Ambae (formerly Aoba Island). Ambae is located in Vanuatu (known as New Hebrides at the time the song was written).\n\nAmbae is visible on the horizon from Espiritu Santo island, where James A. Michener was stationed in World War II. Michener referred to the island in his book, \"Tales of the South Pacific\", which is the basis for the musical \"South Pacific\". The author used the tranquil, hazy image of the smoothly sloping island on the horizon to represent a not-so-distant but always unattainable place of innocence and happiness. Hence the longing nature of the song. In his memoir, \"The World Is My Home\" (1992), Michener writes of his time in the Treasury Islands: \"On a rude signboard attached to a tree, someone had affixed a cardboard giving the settlement's name, and it was so completely different from ordinary names, so musical to my ear that I borrowed a pencil and in a soggy notebook jotted the name against the day when I might want to use it for some purpose I could not then envisage: Bali-ha'i.\"\n\nIn the 1958 film adaptation, Bali Ha'i is portrayed by the real-life island of Tioman in Malaysia. However, the scene was filmed on the north shore of Kauai; Mount Makana was used as Bali Hai and is still known as Bali Hai today. Tunnel's Beach is often referred to as \"Nurses' Beach\", and the scene where Bloody Mary sings \"Bali Ha'i\" is set on Hanalei Bay.\n\nMr. Bali Hai is the name of a mixed drink that originated at the Bali Hai restaurant on Shelter Island in California.\n\nBali Hai is the brand name for a beer produced by Bali Hai Brewery in Indonesia. \n\nItalian Swiss Colony produced the \"pop wine\" Bali Hai wine in the 20th century.\n\nIn the \"Better Call Saul\" episode of the same name, Saul Goodman sings this song to his romantic interest Kim Wexler.\n"}

He is often credited with inventing the Latin letter G. His invention would have been quickly adopted in the Roman Republic, because the letter C was, at the time, confusingly used both for the /k/ and /g/ sounds. For example, Ruga's own name contained this confusion: \"SPVRIVS CARVILIVS RVCA\" (At that time, \"U\" and \"V\" were also the same letter). Ruga was also the first man in recorded history to open a private elementary school.\n\nPlutarch is the main source for these inventions, and Quintus Terentius Scaurus confirms the former in \"De Orthographia\". The letter G was already in use before 230 BC; Wilhelm Paul Corssen theorized in \"Über Aussprache\" that what Plutarch really meant was that Ruga's elementary school was the first place to assign the C and G to their current phonemes of /k/ and /g/. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "2089941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089941", "title": "Glen Echo Park, Maryland", "text": "Glen Echo Park, Maryland\n\nGlen Echo Park is an arts and cultural center located in Glen Echo, Maryland that, in its former incarnation, was a popular Washington, D.C.-area amusement park that operated for several decades from the early 1900s to the 1960s. The arts and cultural center takes its name from the amusement park.\n\nLocated roughly northwest from downtown Washington, D.C., the site of Glen Echo Park was originally conceived and developed as a National Chautauqua Assembly in 1891. Following the foreclosure and sale of the Chautauqua grounds in 1903, leisure facilities were then developed for the growing population of Washington, D.C. In 1911, the site was significantly expanded to become Glen Echo Amusement Park, which operated continuously until its closure in 1968.\n\nToday Glen Echo Park is one of the more important cultural resources in the Washington, D.C. area, offering hundreds of classes, workshops and performances in the visual and performing arts. The facility is well known for its Art Deco architecture, an antique Dentzel carousel, a historic Spanish Ballroom, as well as its children's theaters, social dance programs, and many public festivals, including Family Day and the Washington Folk Festival. Each year more than 400,000 people attend events and participate in instructional activities at the park. The National Park Service also offers park history tours and maintains a visitors area.\n\nEdwin and Edward Baltzley, inventors, industrialists, and real estate developers, hoped to build upon the banks of the Potomac River a suburban community free of the urban pollution of late-nineteenth century Washington. In order to compete with other suburban developments, the Baltzley brothers planned a series of opulent attractions for their would-be community.\nOn February 24, 1891, the Baltzley brothers incorporated the National Chautauqua of Glen Echo, the 53rd such assembly, and immediately set to building a stone citadel of culture to complement their real estate and resort enterprises. Opened on June 16, 1891, their arts and culture program included lectures and concerts in a 6,000-seat amphitheater; special classes in Bible studies, Greek, and Hebrew; physical training regimens; and university extension courses. Hundreds flocked to the site to picnic, attend lectures on American history by Jane Meade Welch, courses on ancient Egypt by Lysander Dickerman, and concerts by John Philip Sousa and his band. Clara Barton, encouraged by the Baltzleys, not only located her home and the American Red Cross headquarters at Glen Echo, but she presided over the Women's Executive Committee for the Chautauqua itself. The inaugural season's success warranted an extension well into August.\n\nBy the spring of 1892 the various Baltzley enterprises were gravely in debt. On April 7, 1892, the Glen Echo Sand and Building Company, a Baltzley subsidiary, borrowed a large sum of money giving the Chautauqua site as collateral. This was one of many Baltzley mortgages on the site. The financial difficulties spread to the Glen Echo Railroad Company, yet another Baltzley enterprise, which, because of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the adjacent Washington Aqueduct system, had failed to bring the much anticipated street car service to the Chautauqua site and Glen Echo Village. \n\nCompounding their overextended credit, the Baltzley brothers found themselves the victim of common rumor. At the beginning of the 1892 season, rumor had spread throughout Washington that Glen Echo was rampant with malaria. Regardless of the validity of these accusations, when combined with the brother's precarious finances, the Chautauqua site fell into disuse.\n\nIn the early 20th century the Chautauqua site was turned into an amusement park named Glen Echo Park. The amusement park was one of the larger establishments of its type in the Washington, D.C. area, and was very popular well into the late 1940s. By the mid-1950s, however, attendance began to decline due to the growing popularity of larger regional theme parks, such as Disneyland. Another blow to the park occurred in 1960 when the trolley line from Washington, D.C. ceased operation. The amusement park managed to continue operations for a few more years, but was finally closed after the 1968 season.\n\nLike many public facilities in and around the Washington area, Glen Echo Park was restricted to whites for 63 out of the first 70 years of its history. On June 30, 1960, to draw attention to the continuing segregation, a group of college students (primarily from Howard University) staged a sit-in protest on the carousel. Five African American students were subsequently arrested for trespassing. The arrests were appealed to the Supreme Court four years later, and the convictions were reversed in \"Griffin v. Maryland\" on the grounds that the state had unconstitutionally used its police power to help a private business enforce its racial discrimination policy. This led to an eleven-week civil rights campaign against Park policies with students and residents of the nearby Bannockburn community joining together to demand change. As a result, the park opened its doors to all races for the 1961 season.\n\nIn 1966 on the day after Easter, bus transportation was shut down when race protests broke out.\n\nThe last operating park ride, and one of the highlights of the park today, is a 1921 Dentzel menagerie carousel with 38 horses, 2 chariots, 4 rabbits, 4 ostriches, a lion, a tiger, a giraffe, and a prancing deer. A Wurlitzer style 165 Band Organ (formerly a Wurlitzer style 153 band organ), provides the carousel's music. In its heyday the carousel sported an operating brass ring, in which daring riders could reach out and pull a ring out of a holder next to the carousel. Grabbing a brass ring would win the lucky rider a free ride. The brass ring arm is still visible today, although it no longer operates.\n\nThe face of the carousel had changed greatly since 1921, with the animals, rounding boards, inner drum panels, and band organ receiving several new coats of paint over the years. An installation photograph from 1921, as compared to the carousel in 1983, showed an original design of the body and tack on the Indian horse that was very different from the present-day animal. Chipping away at the horse's paint revealed several strata of differently colored and styled paint jobs spanning the past sixty years, with the original 1921 paint at the bottom.\n\nThe carousel was restored by specialist Rosa Ragan, who has restored several other carousels in the United States. She restored the Indian horse by removing the park paint, exposing as much of the original paint as possible, and filling in the gaps in the original paint, a process called inpainting, before covering the horse in a protective varnish. This process, however, exposed the original paint to damage from riders, thus rendering the horse unrideable. In order to restore each animal without risking damage to the original paint, Ragan developed a new process of uncovering the original paint job, recording the colors and design, and then covering the original paint with a reversible varnish before giving the animal a white base coat and repainting it in the original colors. However, Ragan did leave a small window of original paint exposed on each animal for riders to find.\n\nThese glimpses of the original 1921 paint are called \"windows to the past\" and can be found on the plain side (the inward-facing side) of each animal. Ragan's 20-year restoration of the carousel completely overhauled the animals, the band organ, and the rounding boards and drum panels, returning the carousel to its original beauty and splendor.\n\nThe carousel was in a scene in the 1989 comedy Chances Are starring Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Shepherd. The carousel was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\n\n\n\nSince 1971, Glen Echo Park has been part of the National Park Service. Various renovations, backed by government funds and individual donations, have been undertaken throughout the park, notably the Spanish Ballroom, the Arcade building that now hosts art classes and art studios, and the art deco style neon sign.\n\nGlen Echo Park is managed by the Glen Echo Park Partnership for Arts and Culture in cooperation with Montgomery County, Maryland, and the National Park Service. Established by Montgomery County in 2002, the Partnership is a nonprofit organization charged with managing Glen Echo Park's arts programs and facilities, including its historic buildings. The Partnership's mission is to present vibrant artistic, cultural, and educational offerings at the Park and to promote the Park as a unique destination for the region's diverse population. In collaboration with Montgomery County and the National Park Service, the Partnership works with resident artists and organizations to develop distinctive arts programming; operates the historic Dentzel carousel and the Spanish Ballroom; presents an extensive social dance program; produces festivals and special events; conducts fundraising and marketing; and manages and maintains all facilities.\n\nGlen Echo Park is home to thirteen resident artists and arts organizations. The resident artists and organizations offer classes, concerts, exhibitions, open studios hours, workshops, and lectures. Resident programs and artists include: Adventure Theatre MTC, Art Glass Center at Glen Echo, Glen Echo Glassworks, Glen Echo Pottery, J. Jordan Bruns, Photoworks, Playgroup in the Park, the Puppet Co., SilverWorks, Glen Echo Park Aquarium, Washington Conservatory of Music, Yellow Barn Studio & Gallery, and Young Creative Spirit.\n\nThe park hosts several family festivals and special events throughout the year, including Family Day (when the carousel opens for the season), Then & Wow, Labor Day Art Show, Irish Music and Dance Showcase, Washington Folk Festival, Fall Frolic, Contrastock, an extensively-decorated Halloween dance, inaugural balls, and Winter's Eve.  From June through August, the Glen Echo Park Partnership presents a free summer concert series each Thursday night in the Bumper Car Pavilion.\n\nGlen Echo Park offers a broad array of social dance events and classes as part of its standard programs. There are regular dances and classes in waltz, swing, contra, and salsa. Dances take place in the historic Spanish Ballroom, the Bumper Car Pavilion, and the recently renovated, climate-controlled Ballroom Annex (\"The Back Room)\". Approximately 60,000 people attend Glen Echo Park's dances each year. A $19 million renovation of the Spanish Ballroom in 2003 returned it to its original splendor, giving it continued prominence as one of the premiere sites for dancing in the Washington DC area. The 18-month renovation was preceded by a National Park Service led, volunteer-labor makeover of the deteriorating Bumper Car Pavilion, converting it into an all-weather dance pavilion & band shell, for uninterrupted dancing through the renovation. Currently, it remains in use as an alternative dance venue and for private events, such as wedding receptions.\n\nAll social dances are open to the public, for all ages, with no prior experience or partner required. All dances offer an introductory lesson before the dance begins and most include live music. Alcohol is prohibited on park grounds, and smoking is prohibited in all buildings.\n\nPictures of Glen Echo Park are available on .\n\n\nThe following are filed under 7300 MacArthur Boulevard, Glen Echo, Montgomery County, MD:\n"}

The earliest versions were composed only of cooked red beans or mung beans in crushed ice with sugar and milk, a dessert known locally as \"\"mongo-ya\"\". Over the years, more native ingredients were added, resulting in the development of the modern \"halo-halo\".\n\nSome authors specifically attribute it to the 1920s or 1930s Japanese migrants in the Quinta Market of Quiapo, Manila, due to its proximity to the now defunct Insular Ice Plant, which was the source of the city's ice supply.\n\nThe spelling \"halo-halo\" (popularized by Chowking) is considered incorrect by the Commission on the Filipino Language, which prescribes \"haluhalo\". The word is an adjective meaning \"mixed\" in Tagalog, a reduplication of the verb \"halo\" (\"to mix\").\n\nIngredients can vary widely, but they usually include sugar palm fruit (\"kaong\"), coconut sport (\"macapuno\"), saba plantains cooked in syrup (\"minatamis na saging\"), jackfruit (\"langkâ\"), agar jellies (\"gulaman\"), tapioca pearls, nata de coco, sweet potato (\"kamote\"), sweetened beans, cheese, and pounded toasted young rice (\"pinipig\"), among others. Most of the ingredients (fruits, beans, and other sweets) are first placed at the bottom, followed by the shaved ice. This is then topped with either (or a combination of) leche flan, \"ube halaya\" (mashed purple yam), or ube ice cream (sometimes vanilla). Evaporated milk is poured into the mixture upon serving.\n\nA similar Visayan dessert \"binignit\" is also referred to as \"\"ginataang halo-halo\"\" in Tagalog (\"\"halo-halo\" in coconut milk\"), commonly shortened to \"\"ginataan\"\". It is made with mostly the same ingredients, although the latter is usually served hot.\n\nHalo-halo was featured as a Quickfire Challenge dish in the seventh episode of the fourth season of the American reality television series \"Top Chef\". The halo-halo, which featured avocado, mango, kiwi, and nuts, was prepared by Filipino-American contestant Dale Talde and named as one of the top three Quickfire Challenge dishes by guest judge Johnny Iuzzini of Jean Georges. Talde also made the dish in a later episode.\n\nHalo-halo was featured in an episode of \"\" when its host Anthony Bourdain visited a Jollibee branch in Los Angeles. Bourdain praised the dessert and even posted a photo of Jollibee's halo-halo on his Twitter account, which he described as \"oddly beautiful.\"\n\nThe dessert was featured on a Delicious Destinations edition episode of Bizarre Foods.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2089947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2089947", "title": "Gananda, New York", "text": "Gananda, New York\n\nGananda is a small \"master planned community\" (and census-designated place) located in Wayne County, New York, about twenty minutes outside of the city of Rochester, New York. Gananda is considered a community because it does not have its own zip code; it consists of a small portion of the adjoining towns of Walworth and Macedon. While originally designed to be a city with upwards of 90,000 residents, the removal of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funding brought about its current design with fewer than 6,500 residents.\n\nGananda was one of thirteen planned communities receiving Federal guaranty assistance from HUD as part of their New Communities Program, created under the authority of the National Urban Policy and New Community Development Act of 1970. The original city of Gananda was to have occupied a total of and have an expected population of over 90,000 after 30 years. The city would have had approximately 17,000 houses, 12 neighborhood centers, 1 major regional shopping center, 3 smaller shopping centers and a system of recreational facilities containing swimming pools, playgrounds and open space for parks and buffer spaces between housing known as \"Forever Wild\". The state of New York created a new school district for the planned city, Gananda Central School District which had the unique ability to lease school facilities allowing for normal educational usage during school hours and community usage after hours. Today, the Gananda Central School District continues to serve approximately 1,200 students.\n\nThe new city had its flag raising ceremony on September 20, 1973 with the school system operating out of the first of the completed educational and community facilities at 1500 Dayspring Ridge. The first graduating class from the new school system was the Class of 1974. By this point much of the underground infrastructure (water, power, gas, cable television and telephone) had been laid and work on major roadways was on schedule. Problems arose when the company in charge of building the new community, Gananda Development Corporation, ran into financial difficulties in the first and second quarters of 1973. The corporation did not meet liquidity requirements set out by HUD and applied for an additional $14,000,000 guaranty as it would be completely bankrupt by the first quarter of 1975 without the infusion. This was in addition to the original $22,000,000 guaranty from HUD. With the end of 1974 came the end of the City of Gananda. HUD denied any additional funding for Gananda and sold back all but of the proposed city.\n\nWhen HUD finished terminating its interests in the project in 1977 the completed structures from the new city were one of the educational and community facilities, one of the community pools, one of the community parks, underground infrastructure (Electric, Water, Sewer, Gas and Cable TV) and a water treatment facility. The original educational and community facility housed the entire K-12 school system until the 1980s when Richard Mann Elementary was built on the site of the former community garden at 1366 Waterford Road. After renovations the HUD-financed facility contained grades 6-12 until the early 2000s, when the completion of Ruben A. Cirillo high school meant that the original building would only house grades 6-8 and the District offices. The single completed community pool was at 3290 Wildflower Drive and was operated by the community until the early 1990s when financial difficulties caused the property to be sold to the YMCA of Greater Rochester. It operated as a YMCA facility until the early 2000s when it shut down for the last time. The pool and original pool building still exist though now as part of a private residence. The community did not lose access to a public pool though as the opening of Ruben A. Cirillo high school also brought about major renovations and additions to Richard Mann Elementary, one of which was an indoor pool open to the public. The only completed public park was Fox Tail Park, located in the center of the area Wildflower drive encircles. It originally contained a full playground and sports fields of which only the sports fields remain (presently used by the Middle School). The playground was removed in the early 1990s for a new parking lot and gym addition on the present-day Middle school. In addition to these buildings, Gananda is still unique from its neighboring towns in the sense that all utility lines are buried underground whereas once one leaves Gananda utilities are once again carried above ground by utility poles. When HUD discontinued its financial backing of the project the roadbed for both sides of a four-lane Gananda Parkway had already been constructed from Eddy Road to almost Walworth/Penfield Road, State Route 441 (itself slated to have been widened to a four-lane highway had the City of Gananda ever come to fruition). However, with funding from the original project gone, only one side was completed which forms the current Gananda Parkway. The roadbed for the other side of the original four-lane Gananda Parkway is still visible in person as well as via Satellite imagery and an easement still exists if population growth ever warrants its completion.\n\n"}

The state's Public Utilities Commission doesn't regulate liquefied petroleum gas or oil, so those services may not be provided. However, if an LP- or oil-fired heater requires electricity in order to function, the rule requires electrical service to be reconnected.\n\nIn addition to providing warmth for residents, cold weather rules help prevent damage to homes.

The tournament is one of the many South American club competitions that have been organised by CONMEBOL. \nAs through the successive editions of this cup were added new champions from the Copa Libertadores, in 1997 the Conmebol decided that the last teams of each group would descend to reduce the number of teams to disputed it. That year descended Velez Sarsfield, Racing Club and Boca Juniors (all teams from Argentina) and Gremio (Brazil).\nThe competition was discontinued to make way for the Copa Mercosur and Copa Merconorte in 1998, which also grew in importance after the final season of the Copa CONMEBOL in 1999. These tournaments were also discontinued in favor of the Copa Sudamericana which allowed the revival of the Recopa Sudamericana.\n\nPrior to its abolition, the Supercopa Libertadores was regarded as the second most prestigious South American club competition out of the three major tournaments. behind the Copa Libertadores and ahead of the Copa CONMEBOL. The winner of the tournament played the winner of the Copa Libertadores in the Recopa Sudamericana. Since the abolition of the Supercopa, the Recopa Sudamericana place previously reserved for the Supercopa winner has been taken by the winner of the Copa Sudamericana.\n\nThe last champion of the competition was River Plate, while Cruzeiro and Independiente are the most successful clubs in the cup history, having won the tournament two times each. The cup has been won by eight different clubs and won consecutively by Cruzeiro and Independiente.\n\nThe format for the Supercopa Libertadores underwent changes nearly every season.

The tournament has been predominantly a single-elimination tournament with several stages.\n\nEvery round of the competition was contested over a two-legged tie. The teams accumulate points as per the results of the match (3 for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss). The team with more points after both legs advanced to the next round. Unlike European club competitions, South America did not use extra time to decide a tie that was level on aggregate. Ties in points would be broken first by goal difference, and ultimately by a penalty shootout after the culmination of the second leg.\n\n"}

The phrase expresses the belief that constitutional restrictions on governmental power must be balanced against the need for survival of the state and its people. It is most often attributed to Abraham Lincoln, as a response to charges that he was violating the United States Constitution by suspending \"habeas corpus\" during the American Civil War. Although the phrase echoes statements made by Lincoln, and although versions of the sentiment have been advanced at various times in American history, the precise phrase \"suicide pact\" was first used in this context by Justice Robert H. Jackson in his dissenting opinion in \"Terminiello v. Chicago\", a 1949 free speech case decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. The phrase also appears in the same context in \"Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez\", a 1963 U.S. Supreme Court decision written by Justice Arthur Goldberg.\n\nThomas Jefferson offered one of the earliest formulations of the sentiment, although not of the phrase. In 1803, Jefferson's ambassadors to France arranged the purchase of the Louisiana territory in conflict with Jefferson's personal belief that the Constitution did not bestow upon the federal government the right to acquire or possess foreign territory. Due to political considerations, however, Jefferson disregarded his constitutional doubts, signed the proposed treaty, and sent it to the Senate for ratification. In justifying his actions, he later wrote: \n\nA strict observance of the written law is doubtless one of the high duties of a good citizen, but it is not the highest. The laws of necessity, of self-preservation, of saving our country when in danger, are of higher obligation. To lose our country by a scrupulous adherence to the written law, would be to lose the law itself, with life, liberty, property and all those who are enjoying them with us; thus absurdly sacrificing the ends to the means.\n\nUnder the United States Constitution, \"habeas corpus\" can be suspended in cases of rebellion or invasion. The Confederacy was rebelling, thus suspension of habeas corpus was both legal and constitutional—but only if done by Congress, since the Constitution reserves this power under , which pertains solely to congressional powers; Lincoln, meanwhile, usurped the power under his own executive order. After \"habeas corpus\" was suspended by General Winfield Scott in one theater of the Civil War in 1861, Lincoln did write that Scott \"could arrest, and detain, without resort to ordinary processes and forms of law, such individuals as he might deem dangerous to public safety.\" After Chief Justice Roger B. Taney attacked the president for this policy, Lincoln responded in a Special Session to Congress on July 4, 1861 that an insurrection \"in nearly one-third of the States had subverted the whole of the laws . . . Are all the laws, but one, to go unexecuted, and the government itself go to pieces, lest that one be violated?\"\n\nLater in the war, after some had criticized the arrest and detention of Congressman Clement Vallandigham of Ohio, Lincoln wrote to Erastus Corning in June 1862 that Vallandigham was arrested \"because he was laboring, with some effect, to prevent the raising of troops, to encourage desertions from the army, and to leave the rebellion without an adequate military force to suppress it. . . . Must I shoot a simple-minded deserter, while I must not touch a hair of a wily agitator who induces him to desert?\"\n\nIn the 1949 case \"Terminiello v. City of Chicago\", the majority opinion by Justice William O. Douglas overturned the disorderly conduct conviction of a priest whose rantings at a rally had incited a riot. The court held that Chicago's breach of the peace ordinance violated the First Amendment.\n\nAssociate Justice Robert Jackson wrote a twenty-four page dissent in response to the court's four page decision, which concluded: \"The choice is not between order and liberty. It is between liberty with order and anarchy without either. There is danger that, if the court does not temper its doctrinaire logic with a little practical wisdom, it will convert the constitutional Bill of Rights into a suicide pact.\"\n\nJustice Arthur Goldberg wrote the court's opinion in the 1963 U.S. Supreme Court case \"Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez\". While the court ultimately determined that laws permitting stripping draft evaders of their citizenship on the basis of a perceived existential threat to the nation were unconstitutional, Goldberg acknowledged the \"not a suicide pact\" argument, writing: \"The powers of Congress to require military service for the common defense are broad and far-reaching, for while the Constitution protects against invasions of individual rights, it is not a suicide pact.\"\n\nIn 2006, Judge Richard Posner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and professor at the University of Chicago Law School, wrote a book called \"Not a Suicide Pact: The Constitution in a Time of National Emergency\". Posner's position has drawn both critical opposition and support.\n\nIn July 2016, in an interview with NBC's \"Meet the Press\", then Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump referred to this concept. During the Republican primary campaign, Trump proposed a ban on all Muslims from entering the United States. After receiving the nomination, he softened this to suspending immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time that a proven vetting mechanism is in place. When asked if this was a rollback to his previous stance, he denied it was, saying, \"Our constitution is great, but it doesn't necessarily give us the right to commit suicide, okay?\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2090035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090035", "title": "Mark Emmert", "text": "Mark Emmert\n\nMark Allen Emmert (born December 16, 1952) is the current president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. He is the fifth CEO of the NCAA; he was named as the incoming president on April 27, 2010, and assumed his duties on November 1, 2010.\n\nEmmert was previously the 30th president of the University of Washington, his alma mater, taking office in June 2004, becoming the first alumnus in 48 years to lead UW. He left Washington on October 1, 2010, having announced his departure for the NCAA Presidency on April 27, 2010. The University of Washington Board of Regents elected him President Emeritus in honor of his service to the UW.\n\nBefore Emmert became president of the University of Washington, he was chancellor at Louisiana State University and held faculty and administration positions at the University of Connecticut, Montana State University, and University of Colorado.\n\nEmmert was born on December 16, 1952 in Fife, Washington and attended Fife High School, graduating in 1971. He studied at Green River Community College in Auburn, Washington before transferring in spring 1973 to the University of Washington, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1975. He went on to earn a Master of Public Administration in 1976 and a PhD in 1983 from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs of Syracuse University.\n\nEmmert served as provost and vice president for academic affairs at Montana State University from 1991 to 1995. In this role, he, along with the vice president for research, Robert Swenson, led a successful effort to increase research funding at the university, particularly from the National Science Foundation. He also worked with Congressional leaders to gain support for new agricultural research facilities on campus and distance learning programs.\n\nThe NCAA ruled that Montana State was guilty of a \"lack of institutional control\" in 1993, stemming from behavior that occurred before Emmert arrived at MSU. The ruling was reached at the time Emmert belonged to the university's senior management team, along with Jim Isch, a former NCAA official. The case related to academic fraud involving an assistant men's basketball coach and a recruit. The NCAA didn't rule on the case until after Emmert left for UConn in 1995. Emmert had no involvement with the athletic programs in his role as provost and was unaware of the investigation, nor was he ever named or implicated in any wrongdoing.\n\nEmmert joined the University of Connecticut in 1995 as Provost and was later promoted to the position of Chancellor for Academic Affairs, where he oversaw academic matters at the main campus in Storrs, as well as the regional campuses within the university system. He led a strategic planning effort that produced a facilities master plan for the Storrs campus, transforming the facilities on the campus with new buildings for students, faculty and research. Enrollment and research funding both increased during this time. During his tenure the university launched its first major fundraising campaign.\n\nEmmert oversaw the first two years of a ten-year-long, $1 billion construction project, UConn 2000, that added many new academic buildings, residence halls and landscape projects to the Storrs campus, and new buildings and facilities to the regional campuses. UConn 2000 is widely credited with transforming the university. Some of the projects became controversial because of charges of mismanagement in the facilities and contracting services. These issues, which included more than $100 million lost due to mismanagement and more than 100 fire and safety code violations, did not come to light during Emmert's tenure. The vast majority of the projects were begun after Emmert's tenure. Something handwritten on Emmert's stationery in 1998 suggested he was aware of construction management challenges. Some of the construction projects later became the focus of a state investigation in 2005. Governor Rell called it \"astonishing failure of oversight and management.\" Two administrators who oversaw the projects during this time were placed on leave and subsequently resigned six years after Emmert had left the university.\n\nEmmert was named Chancellor of LSU in 1999. He led the creation of the \"Flagship Agenda,\" an effort credited with moving the university significantly forward in its standing as an academic institution, an effort that is still credited with advancing the university in very significant ways. During his tenure the academic preparation of entering freshmen increased substantially. Enrollment from across the country increased as well. LSU's research profile improved as a result of new research initiatives, particularly in computer science, marine and coastal science, and basic sciences. A number of academic construction projects commenced, including buildings and renovations for music and dramatic arts, marine biology and coastal studies, biology, residence halls, and the student union. Fund raising projects were begun that have resulted in dramatic improvements in the Ogden Honors College, the E.J. Ourso College of Business and the College of Engineering. Improvements were made to athletic facilities, most notably the creation of the Cox Communications Academic Center, renovation and expansion of Tiger Stadium, and a new state-of-the-art enclosure for the campus mascot, Mike the Tiger, that has become a major attraction for visitors to campus. Emmert’s wife, DeLaine Emmert, was very engaged in these fund raising efforts. State support for the university reached a then-historic high during Emmert's tenure.\n\nOn November 30, 1999, Emmert hired Nick Saban as football coach. LSU won the BCS Championship in 2003 under Saban's tutelage and was 48-16 over five seasons (2000-04).Prior to Saban's arrival, LSU suffered eight losing seasons from 1989-99. \n\nThe graduation rate of the LSU football team, among the lowest in the SEC when Emmert arrived, was among the highest by 2004.\n\nIn 2001–02, a university instructor made accusations of academic fraud in the school's football program, including plagiarized papers and un-enrolled students showing up in class to take notes for football players. At the time, LSU was already on NCAA probation due to violations in the men's basketball program for violations that predated Emmert's employment. A university-led investigation into the academic fraud allegations found only minor violations. The report stated, \"Despite isolated incidents, the allegations were largely unfounded.\" The NCAA accepted LSU's finding and self-imposed minor penalties (loss of two football scholarships) and declined to put the school on probation. Subsequently, two women sued the university for forcing them from their jobs as a result of whistleblowing about the academic fraud. The lawsuits were settled for $110,000 for each person. During the case, an employee of the academic counseling center confirmed the women's claims under oath, including changed grades for football players. A portion of Emmert's salary was paid by the LSU Foundation, The Alumni Foundation and the Tiger Athletic Foundation.\n\nIn September, 2016 Emmert was honored by LSU as the first Haymon Distinguished Visiting Professor at the Ogden Honors College.\n\nEmmert was president of the University of Washington, his alma mater, from 2004 to 2010. During his tenure the university achieved its highest levels of research funding, private giving, and state support. Undergraduate student qualifications and graduation rates also hit record highs. UW attracted more students globally and nationally. Emmert led the creation of the Husky Promise, a guarantee that tuition and fees would be covered for lower-income students from Washington state who were accepted to UW, a program that has now supported tens of thousands of students at the UW. The UW also increased access for Washington students by expanding UW Bothell and UW Tacoma academic offerings and facilities during Emmert's tenure. The UW Seattle campus was expanded with the purchase of the Safeco tower and property in the University District, adding about of building space. With Emmert as President, new facilities were created for the Foster School of Business, molecular engineering, bioengineering, and residential halls. Improvements were made to athletic facilities, culminating in the full renovation of Husky Stadium.\n\nEmmert initiated an annual summit with the Native American tribal council leaders from throughout the State of Washington and the region to address educational and health concerns. He led the process that culminated in the construction of a Native American House of Knowledge on campus. UW has been attentive to environmental and sustainability issues, and received numerous recognitions for its success during Emmert's tenure. Emmert was amongst the first 20 to sign the American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment and is an active member of its steering committee.\n\nDuring Emmert's tenure, UW received more than $1 billion in grant and contract research funding for the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2007. This marked the first time UW received more than $1 billion in funding for sponsored research in a single year. In his last year at UW, research funding exceeding $1.5 billion. UW has been the top public university in federal research funding since 1974, and among the top five universities, public and private, in federal funding since 1969. In recent years, it has been second only to The Johns Hopkins University. In 2006, under Emmert's presidency, the university created the Department of Global Health and, in the spring of 2007, launched the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. In August 2007, Emmert announced that UW would open an office in Beijing to lay the groundwork for expanding the university's presence in China. Emmert made the announcement during a campus visit by Zhou Wenzhong, ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the United States.\n\nEmmert emphasized efforts to improve UW's environmental sustainability efforts throughout his tenure, leading to the university being recognized nationally as one of the most Eco-friendly campuses \n\nIn January 2007, the fundraising goal for Campaign UW: Creating Futures was increased to $2.5 billion after the campaign reached its initial $2 billion goal 17 months ahead of schedule. When the campaign ended on June 30, 2008, the total raised was more than $2.6 billion. UW received a number of transformational gifts during Emmert's presidency, including a gift in fall of 2007 from the Foster Family Foundation, leading to the business school at the Seattle campus being named the Michael G. Foster School of Business. Emmert was president at the University of Washington when the university announced it was discontinuing its varsity men's and women's swim programs.\n\nWhile at the University of Washington, Emmert was courted by the University of Wisconsin, the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill, Cornell University, the University of California System, and the Louisiana State University System. In February 2008, he turned down an offer from Vanderbilt University that might have made him the highest-paid college leader in the nation. Nevertheless, he was the second most highly compensated public university president in the nation, at $888,000 for 2007-2008. In addition, he received $200,000 compensation for serving on the board of Expeditors International and $140,000 for serving on the board of Weyerhaeuser, giving him a total annual compensation of over $1.2 million. In 2009, a year in which he turned down a pay increase offered by the Regents, Emmert's base salary at the University of Washington was $620,000 per year, but his total compensation package, including deferred compensation, was $906,500 annually, which made him the second highest-earning public university president in the United States, behind Ohio State's Gordon Gee. \n\nOn April 27, 2010, Emmert was named President of the National Collegiate Athletic Association in Indianapolis, Indiana. He assumed his duties on November 1, 2010 and remains president today.\n\nThe NCAA is a voluntary membership association with over 1,100 universities and colleges, over 19,000 teams, and over 460,000 students. Through the Association, rules and policies governing college sports are established by all the colleges and universities through a representative form of decision-making.\n\nEmmert entered the NCAA presidency during a period of dramatic change and controversy in college athletics. He has steadfastly advocated for greater support for student-athletes. Over his first four-year period, the member colleges and universities significantly increased support for Division I college athletes, including providing them with direct participation in, and voting positions on, the Board of Directors, the new DI Council, and within the Autonomy Group of conferences. Students can now be offered four-year scholarships rather than a single year scholarship as previously required. Rules governing the revocation of scholarships have been improved significantly, providing students with greater security. All restrictions on meals and food provided by schools have been lifted. Student athletes are now eligible to receive scholarship funds for the \"full cost of attendance,\" which in most cases provides several thousand dollars per year in addition to tuition, fees, room and board, books and supplies. Greater emphasis is now placed on health and safety issues, including playing and practice rules. \n\nAs President, Emmert created the position of Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of the NCAA and the Sports Science Institute, hiring Dr. Brian Hainline to become the first CMO and director. Dr. Hainline has worked with member schools to establish new protocols and research efforts to improve student health and wellness. In 2014 the NCAA entered a partnership with the Department of Defense for the largest longitudinal study of concussion and head trauma in history, funded initially by a $15 million contribution from the NCAA and $15 million from DoD. Funding has now surpassed $64 million and reached 50,000 students making it by far the most important research on head trauma in the world. Emmert’s advocacy for the health and wellbeing of athletes has also lead to extensive efforts regarding mental health and the reduction of sexual assault. \n\nEmmert has led the Association's efforts to address the issues of LGBT rights, sexual assault and violence, and increasing diversity of coaches and administrators. In April, 2015 Emmert and the business and community leaders of Indianapolis joined forces to object to a potentially discriminatory law passed by the State Legislature, resulting in a reversal of the law several weeks after its passage. In September, 2016 the Board of Governors of the NCAA voted to relocate its championship events planned to be held during the 2016-2017 academic year in North Carolina because of the Board members concerns about the discriminatory impact of HB2. The decision was hailed nationally as a critical part of the decision of the North Carolina legislature to repeal HB2. Similarly, Emmert and the NCAA have been recognized for their leadership by Lambda Legal and the NAACP of South Carolina.\n\nIn 2014 the NCAA Division I member universities, with Emmert's support, voted to change the system used to set their rules and policies so as to include greater input from athletic directors, faculty members, and senior women's athletics, and student athletes themselves, in addition to the university and college presidents who are ultimately responsible for all policy and governance decisions. In 2012 the colleges and universities approved substantial changes to the compliance and oversight policies of the Association. Among other improvements, under Emmert's tenure, the Committee on Infractions, the body that determines penalties and sanctions for rules violations, was expanded to include former university presidents and legal scholars, among others, thereby improving the efficiency and effectiveness of their work.\n\nIn the fall of 2017 in response to an FBI investigation and arrests by the Justice Department’s Southern District of New York of executives of Adidas, sports agents and basketball coaches Emmert formed the Commission on Division I Men's Basketball, chaired by Dr. Condoleezza Rice. He called for swift and decisive action to address this scandals. Within less than a year the Commission called for sweeping reform within the NCAA and the Board of Governor’s and membership bodies passed and the NCAA implemented the recommendations marking a dramatic improvement in the basketball environment.\n\nIn January 2018, a misleading media story implied that Emmert had been personally informed in November 2010 — six months after he was hired as the NCAA's president — to 37 reports involving Michigan State University athletes sexually assaulting women. Subsequent reporting in multiple outlets pointed out that the suggestion that Emmert had been “personally informed” was actually a misleading reference to widely publicized accounts coming from Michigan State during 2010. Throughout his tenure, Emmert has led multiple efforts within the NCAA to confront sexual violence within higher education.\n\nDuring Emmert's tenure, Pennsylvania State University was rocked by the Jerry Sandusky sex abuse scandal. Sandusky, a former football coach at Penn State, was accused and later convicted of sexual molestation of children, including those he had taken to the Penn State athletic facilities. He was also accused of using his access to the Penn State football program as a way of luring victims. The University Board removed the President, Executive Vice President, Athletic Director, and head football coach because of their handling of the Sandusky matter. The media outcry over the scandal was enormous. In response to the uniqueness of the Penn State case and the nature of the allegations, the NCAA Executive Committee and Emmert agreed with the University that Penn State should be allowed to conduct its own inquiry into the scandal.\n\nIn July 2012, former FBI Director Louis Freeh reported to the Penn State board that many serious missteps within the university administration and football program had occurred. Based upon the Freeh report, as well as material made public through the criminal processes, the NCAA Executive Committee, a group of 20 university and college presidents and senior leaders, along with the Division I Board of Directors, also a group of university presidents, agreed to a series of sanctions. They empowered Emmert to enter into an agreement with the Penn State leadership to jointly accept a Consent Decree.\n\nEd Ray, Executive Committee chair at that time and Oregon State president, said that while there has been much speculation on whether the NCAA had the authority to impose any type of penalty related to Penn State, the Executive Committee concluded that the egregious behavior not only goes against the NCAA's rules and constitution, but also against its values.\n\nWhile many in the media called for Penn State football to receive the so-called \"Death Penalty,\" the Executive Committee and Emmert instead entered into the Consent Decree with Penn State leadership that included imposing a $60 million fine to be used to fund nonprofit organizations that combat child sexual abuse, a multi-year reduction in football scholarships, a multi-year post-season ban on football, a vacation of wins from the formal record book for the period during which Sandusky was believed to have been engaging in sexual abuse of children, and the imposition of an Athletic Integrity Agreement which was monitored by former Senator George Mitchell. The Big Ten conference, which includes Penn State as a member, also imposed sanctions on the university as a result of the scandal. The outcome was highly controversial among those who sought harsher punishment and those who sought greater leniency. Supporters of greater leniency argued that the basis of the Consent Decree, the Freeh Report, was overreaching and not supported empirically. Freeh has vigorously defended the report and its conclusions. He is being sued for defamation by, Graham Spanier, the former president of Penn State. Spanier, along with two other former Penn State executives, were found guilty of criminal charges. Critics accused Emmert and the NCAA Executive Committee of a \"rush to judgment\" that did not provide sufficient due process even though the University itself agreed to the settlement agreement. \n\nThe Athletic Integrity Agreement, contained in the consent decree, called upon Penn State to make a large number of administrative and personnel changes over a multiple-year period. Senator Mitchell, in his role as monitor, found that the university was very aggressive in fulfilling the agreement, and recommended to Emmert and the NCAA Executive Committee that some of the sanctions be reduced in recognition of Penn State's positive actions. The Executive Committee agreed and on two occasions reduced the sanctions as a result of the university's seriousness in addressing these matters.\n\nEmmert, however, was criticized over the Penn State case after internal emails surfaced revealing NCAA officials bluffed the university into accepting sanctions. \n\nSeveral legal actions have occurred since the Penn State scandal was uncovered, some involving Penn State, Emmert, and the NCAA and its members; others have been focused on the university itself as it made restitution with the victims of the scandal. A legal suit was brought against Penn State and the NCAA by Senator Corman from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania regarding where the funds from the fine should be spent. The case was ultimately settled by an agreement that the funds could be spent on child sex abuse prevention within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and that the wins that had been vacated from the record book be restored. Major news media outlets both praised and criticized Emmert and the NCAA. Many writers that called for aggressive sanctions against the University, including the so-called death penalty, were disappointed that the NCAA had reduced its sanctions, while other were critical of their \"rush to judgment\" and started asking whether the culture at the NCAA was broken under Emmert's leadership. His presidency has been called \"feckless, arrogant, self-aggrandizing, inept\" and operating under \"tortured logic.\" \n\nFinal Resolution of Penn State-Sandusky Scandal\n\nOn May 5, 2016 a Pennsylvania judge, Gary Glazer, barred Penn State from receiving insurance coverage to pay settlements to Sandusky's accusers. The judge pointed to the University's \"negligent employment, investigation, and retention of Sandusky,\" adding that, \"When he abused children ... he was still a PSU assistant coach and professor, and clothed in the glory associated with those titles, particularly in the eyes of impressionable children. By cloaking him with a title that enabled him to perpetrate his crimes, PSU must assume some responsibility for what he did both on and off campus.\" PSU at that point had paid out $93 million to more than 30 Sandusky accusers.\n\nOn October 27, 2016 Mike McQueary, the former assistant coach who reported to Joe Paterno that he'd observed Sandusky's sexual assault of a child in the teams showers, was awarded $7.3 million by a Pennsylvania jury, to be paid by Penn State for defamation. Shortly thereafter on November 20, 2016 the Judge in the case, Thomas Gavin, ruled in favor of McQueary's whistleblower claim and added another $5 million to the jury verdict. In a rebuke to PSU Judge Gavin wrote, \"Only when the 'Sandusky Matter' became public was Mr. McQueary subjected to disparate treatment and adverse employment consequences.\" The university, he stated, had imposed \"the equivalent of banishment.\" on McQueary, including \"being told to clean out his office in the presence of Penn State personnel, an action that suggests he had done something wrong and was not to be trusted.\" Tribune news services, Chicago Tribune, November 30, 2016\n\nOn June 2, 2017 in the remaining criminal cases all three of the university's administrators - Spanier, Schultz, and Curly - originally implicated by the Freeh Report and the grand jury were found guilty of child endangerment by the State of Pennsylvania and sentenced to jail time. The Judge in the case, John Boccabella, when announcing the sentences said, \"Why Mr. Sandusky was allowed to continue to go to the Penn State facilities is beyond me. All three ignored the opportunity to put an end to [Sandusky's] crimes when they had a chance to do so.\" Judge Boccabella also criticized deceased head coach Joe Paterno, saying Coach Paterno, \"could have made that phone call without so much as getting his hands dirty. Why he didn't is beyond me.\" \n\nOn June 30, 2017 the Paterno family dropped \"with prejudice\" (meaning it cannot be refiled) its final lawsuit against the NCAA and Mark Emmert and Ed Ray of Oregon State University. The NCAA recognized that this decision as a complete 'victory\" for their position. The NCAA (as well as Emmert and Ray) made no payments or offered any other consideration for dropping the suit. The NCAA chief legal officer, Donald Remy stated, \"The Paterno family characterized this case as a 'search for truth.' Its decision today, to abandon its lawsuit rather than subject those facts to courtroom examination is telling. We believe that the powerful record developed during discovery overwhelmingly confirmed what the NCAA has believed all along: the NCAA acted reasonably in adopting the conclusions of the eight-month investigation by Louis Freeh.” The Paterno Family decided to drop their lawsuit hours before the NCAA was to file for summary judgment.\n\nPenn State University has, as of January 7, 2017 according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, spent over $250 million to resolve these issues.\n\nEmmert, as well as a number of high-profile leaders of intercollegiate athletics, including university presidents, conference commissioners, and athletic directors, were called upon to testify in the case of \"O'Bannon v. NCAA\" regarding the use of college student athletes' names, images, and likenesses. The case was ultimately appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals which ruled partially in favor of both parties.\n\nEmmert is currently a Life Member of the Council of Foreign Relations and a fellow of the National Academy for Public Administration. He is a former Fulbright Administrative Fellow, and a former Fellow of the American Council on Education. He serves as a Director on the boards of Weyerhaeuser and Expeditors International. In June 2016, he sold approximately $300,000 in Weyerhaeuser shares. Emmert has been honored with several honorary degrees from American universities and colleges.\n\nEmmert was named President Emeritus by the University of Washington Board of Regents in 2010. He holds Honorary Degrees from several colleges and universities.\n\nOn March 18, 2014, Emmert was a guest on ESPN Radio's \"Mike & Mike\". During his appearance, an #AskEmmert hashtag was used to propose questions for Emmert. While well-intended, the hashtag was quickly used by the public to air grievances about NCAA actions and express general disapproval with Emmert's presidency.\n\nMark and DeLaine Emmert have been married for more than 40 years and have two adult children.\n"}
{"id": "2090039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090039", "title": "Geology of Mercury", "text": "Geology of Mercury\n\nThe geology of Mercury is the least understood of all the terrestrial planets in the Solar System. This stems largely from Mercury's proximity to the Sun which makes reaching it with spacecraft technically challenging and Earth-based observations difficult.\n\nMercury's surface is dominated by impact craters, basaltic rock and smooth plains, many of them a result of flood volcanism, similar in some respects to the lunar maria, and locally by pyroclastic deposits. Other notable features include vents which appear to be the source of magma-carved valleys, often-grouped irregular-shaped depressions termed \"hollows\" that are believed to be the result of collapsed magma chambers, scarps indicative of thrust faulting and mineral deposits (possibly ice) inside craters at the poles. Long thought to be geologically inactive, new evidence suggests there may still be some level of activity.\n\nMercury's density implies a solid iron-rich core that accounts for about 60% of its volume (75% of its radius). Mercury's magnetic equator is shifted nearly 20% of the planet's radius towards the north, the largest ratio of all planets. This shift suggests there being one or more iron-rich molten layers surrounding the core producing a dynamo effect similar to that of Earth. Additionally, the offset magnetic dipole may result in uneven surface weathering by the solar wind, knocking more surface particles up into the southern exosphere and transporting them for deposit in the north. Scientists are gathering telemetry to determine if such is the case.\n\nAfter having completed the first solar day of its mission in September 2011, more than 99% of Mercury's surface had been mapped by NASA's \"MESSENGER\" probe in both color and monochrome with such detail that scientists' understanding of Mercury's geology has significantly surpassed the level achieved following the \"Mariner 10\" flybys of the 1970s.\n\nReaching Mercury from Earth poses significant technical challenges, because the planet orbits so much closer to the Sun than does the Earth. A Mercury-bound spacecraft launched from Earth must travel 91 million kilometers into the Sun's gravitational potential well. Starting from the Earth's orbital speed of 30 km/s, the change in velocity (delta-v) the spacecraft must make to enter into a Hohmann transfer orbit that passes near Mercury is large compared to other planetary missions. The potential energy liberated by moving down the Sun's potential well becomes kinetic energy; requiring another large delta-\"v\" to do anything other than rapidly pass by Mercury. In order to land safely or enter a stable orbit the spacecraft must rely entirely on rocket motors because Mercury has negligible atmosphere. A direct trip to Mercury actually requires more rocket fuel than that required to escape the Solar System completely. As a result, only two space probes, \"Mariner 10\" and \"MESSENGER\", both by NASA, have visited Mercury so far.\n\nFurthermore, the space environment near Mercury is demanding, posing the double dangers to spacecraft of intense solar radiation and high temperatures.\n\nHistorically, a second obstacle has been that Mercury's period of rotation is a slow 58 Earth days, so that spacecraft flybys are restricted to viewing only a single illuminated hemisphere. In fact, unfortunately, even though Mariner 10 space probe flew past Mercury three times during 1974 and 1975, it observed the same area during each pass. This was because Mariner 10's orbital period was almost exactly 3 sidereal Mercury days, and the same face of the planet was lit at each of the close approaches. As a result, less than 45% of the planet's surface was mapped.\n\nEarth-based observations are made difficult by Mercury's constant proximity to the Sun. This has several consequences:\n\nLike the Earth, Moon and Mars, Mercury's geologic history is divided up into eras. From oldest to youngest, these are: the pre-Tolstojan, Tolstojan, Calorian, Mansurian, and Kuiperian. These ages are based on relative dating only.\n\nAfter the formation of Mercury along with the rest of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago, heavy bombardment by asteroids and comets ensued. The last intense bombardment phase, the Late Heavy Bombardment came to an end about 3.8 billion years ago. Some regions or massifs, a prominent one being the one that formed the Caloris Basin, were filled by magma eruptions from within the planet. These created smooth intercrater plains similar to the maria found on the Moon.\nLater, as the planet cooled and contracted, its surface began to crack and form ridges; these surface cracks and ridges can be seen on top of other features, such as the craters and smoother plains—a clear indication that they are more recent.\nMercury's period of volcanism ended when the planet's mantle had contracted enough to prevent further lava from breaking through to the surface. This probably occurred at some point during its first 700 or 800 million years of history.\n\nSince then, the main surface processes have been intermittent impacts.\n\nTime unit: millions of years\n\nMercury's surface is overall similar in appearance to that of the Moon, with extensive mare-like plains and heavily cratered terrains similar to the lunar highlands and made locally by accumulations of pyroclastic deposits.\n\nCraters on Mercury range in diameter from small bowl-shaped craters to multi-ringed impact basins hundreds of kilometers across. They appear in all states of degradation, from relatively fresh rayed-craters, to highly degraded crater remnants. Mercurian craters differ subtly from Lunar craters – the extent of their ejecta blankets is much smaller, which is a consequence of the 2.5 times stronger surface gravity on Mercury.\nThe largest known crater is the enormous Caloris Basin, with a diameter of 1550 km, A basin of comparable size, tentatively named Skinakas Basin had been postulated from low resolution Earth-based observations of the non-Mariner-imaged hemisphere, but has not been observed in \"MESSENGER\" imagery of the corresponding terrain. The impact which created the Caloris Basin was so powerful that its effects are seen on a global scale. It caused lava eruptions and left a concentric ring over 2 km tall surrounding the impact crater. At the antipode of the Caloris Basin lies a large region of unusual, hilly and furrowed terrain, sometimes called \"Weird Terrain\". The favoured hypothesis for the origin of this geomorphologic unit is that shock waves generated during the impact traveled around the planet, and when they converged at the basin's antipode (180 degrees away) the high stresses were capable of fracturing the surface. A much less favoured idea was that this terrain formed as a result of the convergence of ejecta at this basin's antipode. Furthermore, the formation of the Caloris Basin appears to have produced a shallow depression concentric around the basin, which was later filled by the smooth plains (see below).\n\nOverall about 15 impact basins have been identified on the imaged part of Mercury. Other notable basins include the 400 km wide, multi-ring, Tolstoj Basin which has an ejecta blanket extending up to 500 km from its rim, and its floor has been filled by smooth plains materials. Beethoven Basin also has a similar-sized ejecta blanket and a 625 km diameter rim.\n\nAs on the Moon, fresh craters on Mercury show prominent bright ray systems. These are made by ejected debris, which tend to be brighter while they remain relatively fresh because of a lesser amount of space weathering than the surrounding older terrain.\n\nSome impact craters on Mercury have non-circular, irregularly shaped depressions or pits on their floors. Such craters have been termed pit-floor craters, and \"MESSENGER\" team members have suggested that such pits formed by the collapse of subsurface magma chambers. If this suggestion is correct, the pits are evidence of volcanic processes at work on Mercury. Pit craters are rimless, often irregularly shaped, and steep-sided, and they display no associated ejecta or lava flows but are typically distinctive in color. For example, the pits of Praxiteles have an orange hue. Thought to be evidence of shallow magmatic activity, pit craters may have formed when subsurface magma drained elsewhere and left a roof area unsupported, leading to collapse and the formation of the pit. Major craters exhibiting these features include Beckett, Gibran and Lermontov, among others. It was suggested that these pits with associated brighter and redder deposits may be pyroclastic deposits caused by explosive volcanism.\nThere are two geologically distinct plains units on Mercury:\nThe floor of the Caloris Basin is also filled by a geologically distinct flat plain, broken up by ridges and fractures in a roughly polygonal pattern. It is not clear whether they are volcanic lavas induced by the impact, or a large sheet of impact melt.\n\nOne unusual feature of the planet's surface is the numerous compression folds which crisscross the plains. It is thought that as the planet's interior cooled, it contracted and its surface began to deform. The folds can be seen on top of other features, such as craters and smoother plains, indicating that they are more recent. Mercury's surface is also flexed by significant tidal bulges raised by the Sun—the Sun's tides on Mercury are about 17% stronger than the Moon's on Earth.\n\nNon-crater surface features are given the following names:\nThe first radar observations of Mercury were carried out by the radiotelescopes at Arecibo (Puerto Rico) and Goldstone (California, United States), with assistance from the U.S. National Radio Astronomy Observatory Very Large Array (VLA) facility in New Mexico. The transmissions sent from the NASA Deep Space Network site at Goldstone were at a power level of 460 kW at 8.51 GHz; the signals received by the VLA multi-dish array detected points of radar reflectivity (radar luminosity) with depolarized waves from Mercury's north pole.\nRadar maps of the surface of the planet were made using the Arecibo radiotelescope. The survey was conducted with 420 kW UHF band (2.4 GHz) radio waves which allowed for a 15 km resolution. This study not only confirmed the existence of the zones of high reflectivity and depolarization, but also found a number of new areas (bringing the total to 20) and was even able to survey the poles. It has been postulated that surface ice may be responsible for these high luminosity levels, as the silicate rocks that compose most of the surface of Mercury have exactly the opposite effect on luminosity.\n\nIn spite of its proximity to the Sun, Mercury may have surface ice, since temperatures near the poles are constantly below freezing point: On the polar plains, the temperature does not rise above −106 °C. And craters at Mercury's higher latitudes (discovered by radar surveys from Earth as well) may be deep enough to shield the ice from direct sunlight. Inside the craters, where there is no solar light, temperatures fall to −171 °C.\n\nDespite sublimation into the vacuum of space, the temperature in the permanently shadowed region is so low that this sublimation is slow enough to potentially preserve deposited ice for billions of years.\n\nAt the South Pole, the location of a large zone of high reflectivity coincides with the location of the Chao Meng-Fu crater, and other small craters containing reflective areas have also been identified. At the North Pole, a number of craters smaller than Chao-Meng Fu have these reflective properties.\n\nThe strength of the radar reflections seen on Mercury are small compared to that which would occur with pure ice. This may be due to powder deposition that does not cover the surface of the crater completely or other causes, e.g. a thin overlying surface layer. However, the evidence for ice on Mercury is not definitive. The anomalous reflective properties could also be due to the existence of deposits of metallic sulfates or other materials with high reflectance.\n\nMercury is not unique in having craters that stand in permanent shadow; at the south pole of Earth's Moon there is a large crater (Aitken) where some possible signs of the presence of ice have been seen (although their interpretation is disputed). It is thought by astronomers that ice on both Mercury and the Moon must have originated from external sources, mostly impacting comets. These are known to contain large amounts, or a majority, of ice. It is therefore conceivable for meteorite impacts to have deposited water in the permanently shadow craters, where it would remain unwarmed for possibly billions of years due to the lack of an atmosphere to efficiently conduct heat and stable orientation of Mercury's rotation axis.\n\nThere may be scientific support, based on studies reported in March 2020, for considering that parts of the planet Mercury may have been habitable, and perhaps that life forms, albeit likely primitive microorganisms, may have existed on the planet.\n\n\n\n"}

Kernel density estimation is a fundamental data smoothing problem where inferences about the population are made, based on a finite data sample. In some fields such as signal processing and econometrics it is also termed the Parzen–Rosenblatt window method, after Emanuel Parzen and Murray Rosenblatt, who are usually credited with independently creating it in its current form. One of the famous applications of kernel density estimation is in estimating the class-conditional marginal densities of data when using a naive Bayes classifier, which can improve its prediction accuracy dramatically. \n\nLet (\"x\", \"x\", …, \"x\") be a univariate independent and identically distributed sample drawn from some distribution with an unknown density \"ƒ\". We are interested in estimating the shape of this function \"ƒ\". Its \"kernel density estimator\" is\nwhere \"K\" is the kernel — a non-negative function — and is a smoothing parameter called the \"bandwidth\". A kernel with subscript \"h\" is called the \"scaled kernel\" and defined as . Intuitively one wants to choose \"h\" as small as the data will allow; however, there is always a trade-off between the bias of the estimator and its variance. The choice of bandwidth is discussed in more detail below.\n\nA range of kernel functions are commonly used: uniform, triangular, biweight, triweight, Epanechnikov, normal, and others. The Epanechnikov kernel is optimal in a mean square error sense, though the loss of efficiency is small for the kernels listed previously. Due to its convenient mathematical properties, the normal kernel is often used, which means , where \"ϕ\" is the standard normal density function.\n\nThe construction of a kernel density estimate finds interpretations in fields outside of density estimation. For example, in thermodynamics, this is equivalent to the amount of heat generated when heat kernels (the fundamental solution to the heat equation) are placed at each data point locations \"x\". Similar methods are used to construct discrete Laplace operators on point clouds for manifold learning (e.g. diffusion map).\n\nKernel density estimates are closely related to histograms, but can be endowed with properties such as smoothness or continuity by using a suitable kernel. To see this, we compare the construction of histogram and kernel density estimators, using these 6 data points:\n\nFor the histogram, first the horizontal axis is divided into sub-intervals or bins which cover the range of the data. In this case, we have six bins each of width 2. Whenever a data point falls inside this interval, we place a box of height 1/12. If more than one data point falls inside the same bin, we stack the boxes on top of each other.\n\nFor the kernel density estimate, we place a normal kernel with standard deviation 2.25 (indicated by the red dashed lines) on each of the data points \"x\". The kernels are summed to make the kernel density estimate (solid blue curve). The smoothness of the kernel density estimate is evident compared to the discreteness of the histogram, as kernel density estimates converge faster to the true underlying density for continuous random variables.\n\nThe bandwidth of the kernel is a free parameter which exhibits a strong influence on the resulting estimate. To illustrate its effect, we take a simulated random sample from the standard normal distribution (plotted at the blue spikes in the rug plot on the horizontal axis). The grey curve is the true density (a normal density with mean 0 and variance 1). In comparison, the red curve is \"undersmoothed\" since it contains too many spurious data artifacts arising from using a bandwidth \"h\" = 0.05, which is too small. The green curve is \"oversmoothed\" since using the bandwidth \"h\" = 2 obscures much of the underlying structure. The black curve with a bandwidth of \"h\" = 0.337 is considered to be optimally smoothed since its density estimate is close to the true density. An extreme situation is encountered in the limit formula_2 (no smoothing), where the estimate is a sum of \"n\" delta functions centered at the coordinates of analyzed samples. In the other extreme limit formula_3 the estimate retains the shape of the used kernel, centered on the mean of the samples (completely smooth).\n\nThe most common optimality criterion used to select this parameter is the expected \"L\" risk function, also termed the mean integrated squared error:\n\nUnder weak assumptions on \"ƒ\" and \"K\", (\"ƒ\" is the, generally unknown, real density function),\nMISE (\"h\") = AMISE(\"h\") + \"o(1/(nh) + h)\" where \"o\" is the little o notation.\nThe AMISE is the Asymptotic MISE which consists of the two leading terms\n\nwhere formula_6 for a function \"g\", formula_7\nand \"ƒ\"\" is the second derivative of \"ƒ\". The minimum of this AMISE is the solution to this differential equation\n\nor\n\nNeither the AMISE nor the \"h\" formulas are able to be used directly since they involve the unknown density function \"ƒ\" or its second derivative \"ƒ\"\", so a variety of automatic, data-based methods have been developed for selecting the bandwidth. Many review studies have been carried out to compare their efficacies, with the general consensus that the plug-in selectors\n\nSubstituting any bandwidth \"h\" which has the same asymptotic order \"n\" as \"h\" into the AMISE\ngives that AMISE(\"h\") = \"O\"(\"n\"), where \"O\" is the big o notation. It can be shown that, under weak assumptions, there cannot exist a non-parametric estimator that converges at a faster rate than the kernel estimator. Note that the \"n\" rate is slower than the typical \"n\" convergence rate of parametric methods.\n\nIf the bandwidth is not held fixed, but is varied depending upon the location of either the estimate (balloon estimator) or the samples (pointwise estimator), this produces a particularly powerful method termed adaptive or variable bandwidth kernel density estimation.\n\nBandwidth selection for kernel density estimation of heavy-tailed distributions is relatively difficult.\n\nIf Gaussian basis functions are used to approximate univariate data, and the underlying density being estimated is Gaussian, the optimal choice for \"h\" (that is, the bandwidth that minimises the mean integrated squared error) is:\n\nIn order to make the h value more robust to make the fitness well for both long-tailed and skew distribution and bimodal mixture distribution, it is better to substitute the value of formula_11 with another parameter A, which is given by:\n\nAnother modification that will improve the model is to reduce the factor from 1.06 to 0.9. Then the final formula would be:\n\nwhere formula_11 is the standard deviation of the samples, n is the sample size. IQR is the interquartile range.\nThis approximation is termed the \"normal distribution approximation\", Gaussian approximation, or \"Silverman's (1986) rule of thumb\".\nWhile this rule of thumb is easy to compute, it should be used with caution as it can yield widely inaccurate estimates when the density is not close to being normal. For example, consider estimating the bimodal Gaussian mixture:\n\nfrom a sample of 200 points. The figure on the right below shows the true density and two kernel density estimates—one using the rule-of-thumb bandwidth, and the other using\na solve-the-equation bandwidth. The estimate based on the rule-of-thumb bandwidth is significantly oversmoothed.\nThe Matlab script for this example uses \nkde.m and is given below.\n% Data\nrandn('seed',1) % Used for reproducibility\ndata = [randn(100,1)-10; randn(100,1)+10]; % Two Normals mixed\n% True\nphi = @(x) exp(-.5*x.^2)/sqrt(2*pi); % Normal Density\ntpdf = @(x) phi(x+10)/2+phi(x-10)/2; % True Density\n% Kernel\nh = std(data)*(4/3/numel(data))^(1/5); % Bandwidth estimated by Silverman's Rule of Thumb\nkernel = @(x) mean(phi((x-data)/h)/h); % Kernel Density\nkpdf = @(x) arrayfun(kernel,x); % Elementwise application\n% Plot\nfigure(2), clf, hold on\nx = linspace(-25,+25,1000); % Linear Space\nplot(x,tpdf(x)) % Plot True Density\nplot(x,kpdf(x)) % Plot Kernel Density with Silverman's Rule of Thumb\nkde(data) % Plot Kernel Density with Solve-the-Equation Bandwidth\nset.seed(1) #Used for reproducibility\ndata = c(rnorm(100,-10,1),rnorm(100,10,1)) #Two Normals mixed\nphi = function(x) exp(-.5*x^2)/sqrt(2*pi) #Normal Density\ntpdf = function(x) phi(x+10)/2+phi(x-10)/2 #True Density\nh = sd(data)*(4/3/length(data))^(1/5) #Bandwidth estimated by Silverman's Rule of Thumb\nKernel2 = function(x) mean(phi((x-data)/h)/h) #Kernel Density\nkpdf = function(x) sapply(x,Kernel2) #Elementwise application\nx=seq(-25,25,length=1000) #Linear Space\nplot(x,tpdf(x),type=\"l\",ylim=c(0,0.23),col=\"red\") #Plot True Density\npar(new=T)\nplot(x,kpdf(x),type=\"l\",ylim=c(0,0.23),xlab=\"\",ylab=\"\",axes=F) #Plot Kernel Density with Silverman's Rule of Thumb\nGiven the sample (\"x\", \"x\", …, \"x\"), it is natural to estimate the characteristic function as\nKnowing the characteristic function, it is possible to find the corresponding probability density function through the Fourier transform formula. One difficulty with applying this inversion formula is that it leads to a diverging integral, since the estimate formula_16 is unreliable for large \"t\"’s. To circumvent this problem, the estimator formula_16 is multiplied by a damping function , which is equal to 1 at the origin and then falls to 0 at infinity. The “bandwidth parameter” \"h\" controls how fast we try to dampen the function formula_16. In particular when \"h\" is small, then \"ψ\"(\"t\") will be approximately one for a large range of \"t\"’s, which means that formula_16 remains practically unaltered in the most important region of \"t\"’s.\n\nThe most common choice for function \"ψ\" is either the uniform function }, which effectively means truncating the interval of integration in the inversion formula to , or the Gaussian function . Once the function \"ψ\" has been chosen, the inversion formula may be applied, and the density estimator will be\n\nwhere \"K\" is the Fourier transform of the damping function \"ψ\". Thus the kernel density estimator coincides with the characteristic function density estimator.\n\nWe can extend the definition of the (global) mode to a local sense and define the local modes:\n\nNamely, formula_22 is the collection of points for which the density function is locally maximized. A natural estimator of formula_22 is a plug-in from KDE, where formula_24 and formula_25 are KDE version of formula_24 and formula_27. Under mild assumptions, formula_28 is a consistent estimator of formula_22. Note that one can use the mean shift algorithm to compute the estimator formula_28 numerically.\n\nA non-exhaustive list of software implementations of kernel density estimators includes:\n\n\n"}

Howe during the Second World War. He was perhaps one of the greatest industrialists and business minds in Canadian history; Gordon bought two companies and held one CEO position, but eventually lost it all.\n\nGordon was born in Winnipeg in 1914. He was the first child of Crawford Gordon Sr. and Ethel Flora Fortune, the latter of whom had survived the sinking of the RMS \"Titanic\" in 1912.\n\nGordon was one of C. D. Howe's \"boys\", or \"dollar-a-year men\" during the Second World War, helping the government organize industrial resources to meet the needs of wartime production and resource management.\n\nIn October 1951, Howe arranged for Gordon, now with the Department of Defense Production, to take over as President and General Manager of A. V. Roe Canada (\"Avro Canada\"), a subsidiary of A.V. Roe and Company of the U.K., to assist with problems in development and production of the CF-100 Canuck fighter interceptor. Under Gordon's encouragement to Avro's designers, Avro offered to design and build the new supersonic jet interceptor identified by the Canadian Chiefs of Staff as needed to counter a Soviet Union bomber threat. In 1953 the government commenced funding of a study for what would first be the design for the C104 delta-wing aircraft, and eventually the CF-105 Arrow.\n\nDuring Crawford's tenure in the 1950s, A.V. Roe Canada was restructured into two separate divisions: Avro Aircraft Ltd. and Orenda Engines, both based at Malton Airport. The total labour force of both aviation companies reached 15,000 in 1958. During the same period, A.V. Roe Canada also purchased a number of companies, including Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation, Canada Car and Foundry (1957) and Canadian Steel Improvement Ltd. By 1958, A. V. Roe Canada was an industrial giant with over 50,000 employees in a far-flung empire of 44 companies involved in coal mining, steel making, railway rolling stock, aircraft and aero-engine manufacturing, as well as computers and electronics. The companies generated annual sales in the $450 million range, ranking A.V. Roe Canada as the third largest corporation in Canada.\n\nGordon continued to ask for further funding as the interceptor program for the CF-105 Arrow proceeded, particularly as the program scope expanded to include the new Orenda Iroquois advanced turbojet engine, when other manufacturers' engine designs were dropped or proved inadequate. When the Liberal government in which Howe served was defeated, Gordon had to deal with the new Progressive Conservative government of John Diefenbaker, a government that narrowly viewed such ambitious, costly projects.\n\nGordon may have clashed with the Diefenbaker government due to a number of pressures, including the unexpected delays in getting the Avro Arrow into production, and the threat to the Arrow from the rise of the missile (it was designed to intercept manned bombers). There may have also been a clash of personalities: during the only meeting between the two, Gordon was described as \"drunken, rude\" and \"puffed (cigarette) smoke in the old man's face\". Gordon was a heavy drinker and Diefenbaker a teetotaler and non-smoker.\n\nGordon's battles and gambles finally lost out when the Arrow program was canceled on 20 February 1959. Gordon was fired as A.V. Roe Canada president not long after the Arrow cancellation. Gordon's life was on a downward spiral afterward.\n\nBy the summer of 1966, his net worth of $3 million had mostly evaporated. After a long battle with alcoholism, Crawford Gordon died in New York City on 26 January 1967 of liver failure. Friends said he drank himself to his death; he could handle success, but not failure.\nCrawford Gordon was portrayed, with a good visible likeness, by Dan Aykroyd in the 1996 mini-series \"The Arrow\". It is fact, that his secretary Audrey Underwood (given the name Claire in the CBC mini-series) left AVRO Canada for New York to escape from her relationship with Crawford who had refused to divorce his wife. Crawford pursued her to New York in an attempt to win back her love. (As verified by Arrow Expert, Greig Stewart and the Underwood family.) Audrey was the daughter of Canadian Unarmed Combat and Self-Defence legend, Bill Underwood, who created the first Unarmed Combat system for the Canadian Forces in WW2 known as COMBATO (documented by the Canadian Forces.) Crawford's drinking problems and depression then served to exacerbate his distrust of the Diefenbaker government into outright abuse. That abuse did not help with the government's disdain for the Arrow program while it was under budget pressure to make just one choice for aeronautic defense of Canadian airspace.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Burkes drove up to Barnette's car and told the mob that \"they're going on 19 toward Meridian. Follow them!\" After a quick rendezvous with Philadelphia Police Officer Richard Willis, Price was in pursuit of the three civil rights workers. Posey's Chevrolet carried Jerry M. Sharpe, Jimmy L. Townsend, and Alton W. Roberts. Horace Barnette had a two-toned blue Ford Fairlane sedan. In Horace's car were James Jordan, Jimmy K. Arledge, Jimmy Snowden, Roberts, and Posey. Posey's car apparently had carburetor problems and broke down on the side of the road. Sharpe and Townsend were ordered to stay with the car and get it running again. Price eventually caught the CORE station wagon heading west toward Union, Mississippi, on state highway 492.\n\nSoon the three civil right workers would be escorted north on Highway 19 to secluded Rock Cut Road where they would be executed at the hand of Roberts and Jordan.\n\nWhen they arrived, Roberts reportedly pulled Schwerner out of the car, pointing a gun at his chest. \"Are you that nigger lover?\" Roberts asked, his left hand on Schwerner's shoulder. \"Sir, I know just how you feel,\" Schwerner replied. Roberts then shot him in the heart and then grabbed Goodman, shooting him in the chest near his right shoulder. Chaney ran, but Roberts along with other Klansmen were able to shoot him dead before he could run any farther. Roberts fired into Chaney's lower back and his head. Prosecutors said that Roberts fired two of the three bullets found in Chaney's body. After the murders James Jordan was accused of saying \"well, you didn't leave me nothing but a nigger, but at least I killed me a nigger.\"\n\nOn December 4, 1964, The Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested several men for engineering a conspiracy to injure, oppress, threaten, and intimidate Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner. Roberts was one of many rounded up that day.\n\nRoberts was indicted on February 28, 1967. He went to federal trial in Meridian on October 7 of that same year; 13 days later, he was convicted. At the sentence hearing on December 29, 1967, Judge William Harold Cox sentenced Roberts 10 years in federal prison. Roberts served no more than six years, and was free on appeal bond.\n\nRoberts gained national recognition on January 27, 1965, when Jack Thornell took photos of him beating up CBS cameraman Laurens Pierce outside the federal courthouse in Meridian where he was in trial at the time. Roberts's encounter with Pierce was mentioned in the press the next day.\n\nAlong with owning a bar, Roberts was also a window salesman and a mobile home salesman.\n\nAccording to \"People\", Roberts was running a seedy after-hours bar in 1989. The bar was located on Virginia Drive in Meridian, Mississippi\n\n"}
{"id": "2090185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090185", "title": "Telegony", "text": "Telegony\n\nThe Telegony (Greek: , \"Tēlegoneia\"; ) is a lost ancient Greek epic poem about Telegonus, son of Odysseus by Circe. His name (\"born far away\") is indicative of his birth on Aeaea, far from Odysseus' home of Ithaca. It was part of the Epic Cycle of poems that recounted the myths of the Trojan War as well as the events that led up to and followed it. The story of the \"Telegony\" comes chronologically after that of the \"Odyssey\" and is the final episode in the Epic Cycle. The poem was sometimes attributed in antiquity to Cinaethon of Sparta (8th century BC), but in one source it is said to have been stolen from Musaeus by Eugamon or Eugammon of Cyrene (6th century BC) (see Cyclic poets). The poem comprised two books of verse in dactylic hexameter.\n\nIn Antiquity the \"Telegony\" may have also been known as the \"Thesprotis\" (Greek: Θεσπρωτίς), which is referred to once by Pausanias in the 2nd century AD; alternatively, the \"Thesprotis\" may have been a name for the first book of the \"Telegony\", which is set in Thesprotia. Such naming of isolated episodes within a larger epic was common practice for the ancient readers of the Homeric epics.\n\nA third possibility is that there was a wholly separate epic called the \"Thesprotis\"; and yet a fourth possibility is that the \"Telegony\" and \"Thesprotis\" were two separate poems that were at some stage compiled into a single \"Telegony\".\n\nThe date of composition of the \"Telegony\" is uncertain. Cyrene, the native city of purported author Eugammon, was founded in 631 BC; but the narrative details may have existed prior to Eugammon's version, perhaps even in the oral tradition. There is a distinct possibility that the author of the \"Odyssey\" knew at least some version of the \"Telegony\" story (the Thesprotian episode and Telegonus' unusual spear in the \"Telegony\" may have been based on Tiresias' prophecy in \"Odyssey\" book 11; but it is also possible that the \"Odyssey\" poet used the Telegonus story as a basis for Teiresias' prophecy). Certainly Eugammon's poem is most likely to have been composed in the 6th century BC.\n\nOnly two lines of the poem's original text survive. For its storyline we are dependent primarily on a summary of the Telegonus myth in the \"Chrestomathy\" of one \"Proclus\".\n\nThe \"Telegony\" comprises two distinct episodes: Odysseus' voyage to Thesprotia, and the story of Telegonus. Probably each of the two books of the \"Telegony\" related one of these episodes. The poem opens after the events depicted in the \"Odyssey.\" According to Proclus' summary, the \"Telegony\" opens with the burial of Penelope's suitors. Odysseus makes sacrifices to the Nymphs. He makes a voyage to Elis, where he visits an otherwise unknown figure Polyxenos, who gives him a bowl depicting the story of Trophonius. Odysseus returns to Ithaca and then travels to Thesprotia, presumably to make the sacrifices commanded by Tiresias in \"Odyssey\" 11. There he weds the Thesprotian queen Kallidike, who bears him a son, Polypoites. Odysseus fights for the Thesprotians in a war against the neighbouring Brygoi; the gods participate in the war, Ares routing Odysseus and the Thesprotians, countered by Athena, ever Odysseus' patron; Apollo intervenes between the battling gods. However, Kallidike is killed in the war, Polypoetes succeeds to the kingdom and Odysseus returns to Ithaca.\n\nMeanwhile, it transpires that Circe, with whom Odysseus had an affair for a year in the \"Odyssey\" (books 10-12), has borne his son, Telegonus (Τηλέγονος, \"born far away\"). He grows up living with Circe on the island of Aeaea. On the goddess Athena's advice, Circe tells him the name of his father. In a detail inserted into the account in the Epitome of the \"Bibliotheke\" she gives him a supernatural spear to defend himself which is tipped with the sting of a poisonous stingray and was made by the god Hephaestus. A storm forces Telegonus onto Ithaca without his realizing where he is. As is customary for Homeric heroes in unfriendly land, he commits piracy, and unwittingly begins stealing Odysseus' cattle. Odysseus comes to defend his property. During the ensuing fight, Telegonus kills Odysseus with his unusual spear, thereby partially fulfilling Tiresias' prophecy in \"Odyssey\" 11 that death would come to Odysseus \"out of the sea\" (i.e., the poison of the ray). (In another respect, however, Odysseus' death contradicts the prophecy of Tiresias, who predicted (\"Od\". 11.135) that a \"gentle death\" would come to Odysseus \"in sleek old age.\") As Odysseus lies dying, he and Telegonus recognize one another, and Telegonus laments his mistake. Telegonus brings his father's corpse, Penelope, and Odysseus' other son Telemachus, back to Aeaea, where Odysseus is buried and Circe makes the others immortal. Telegonus marries Penelope, and Telemachus marries Circe.\n\nThe 1st-century AD Roman fabulist Hyginus differs from Proclus in adding a few details. First, it is both Odysseus and Telemachus who engage Telegonus in combat. Hyginus then adds that Odysseus had received an oracle to beware his son. Finally, Hyginus attributes to Telegonus a son named Italus, the eponymous founder of Italy; and to Telemachus he attributes a son named Latinus, whose name was given to the Latin language.\n\nNumerous Latin poets make Telegonus the founder of Praeneste or Tusculum, important Latin towns.\n\nIn Dante's \"Divine Comedy\", in the eighth \"bolgia\" of the Inferno, Dante and his guide meet Ulisse among the false counsellors, and receive a variant accounting of Ulisse's death \"from the sea\", in a five-month journey beyond the Pillars of Hercules, that has ended in a whirlpool drowning as the mariners approach the mountain of Purgatory. No Greek source was available to Dante, only the Latin recensions of Dictys and Dares.\n\nAmong the many operas based on the myths of Odysseus and those around him, there is but one based on Telegonus, Carlo Luigi Grua's \"Telegone\" (premiered in Düsseldorf, 1697) of which an aria \"Dia le mosse a miei contenti\" may be noted. Divine intervention, a death and multiple weddings at the end all assorted easily with the conventions of \"opera seria\".\n\n"}

The film also stars Michael Ironside and Sara Botsford. The mini-series is noted as having the highest viewership ever for a CBC program.\n\nOther significant individuals in the program, portrayed in the series, include RCAF pilot Flight Lieutenant Jack Woodman (Ron White) who conducted test flights on Avro aircraft but was supplanted by Janusz Żurakowski (Lubomir Mykytiuk) for the first few flights; Jim Chamberlin (Aidan Devine) and James Floyd (Nigel Bennett) in the design team; Edward Critchley (Ian D. Clark) who would be asked to develop an engine for the Arrow when other models became unavailable.\n\nThe film also boasted cameos by Michael Moriarty as U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Christopher Plummer as the Canadian Minister of Transport George Hees.\n\nPrincipal roles as appearing in screen credits (main roles identified):\nAlthough the miniseries is based on history, it is a work of fiction, employing composite characters, and depicting some events that actually did not take place. It acknowledges that there is no hard evidence to support the fictional final scenes, depicting one Arrow that escaped the torches used to tear the other Arrows apart, in accord with allegations attributed to reporter June Callwood. There are errors in illustrations, such as the wing design (the classified design does not appear on the models used, other than on one model the morning after Jim Chamberlin made his modifications); during the \"destruct and dispose\" operation, an Apollo lunar module is shown in its final configuration, although that design was arrived at by Grumman Aircraft in the later 1960s out of sheer necessity to reduce weight.\n\nWetaskiwin resident Allan Jackson's efforts to build a full-scale model of the Arrow were discovered during the research phase of pre-production. An offer was made to complete the model and use it in the miniseries. A CBC crew of model makers and set designers completed the full-scale model in time for principal photography that took place in Winnipeg. The production eventually used a combination of archival film, remote-control flying models and computer animation for the static, ground and flying sequences.\n\nThe full-scale Arrow model differs slightly from those built in 1957-59. It was featured throughout the film but the wing structure had a pronounced outer panel dihedral that was \"corrected\" by CGI work. The wing design was seen on-screen \"only\" on a wind tunnel model crafted after an \"all-nighter\" by Chamberlin that was stable at Mach 2.5 and higher.\n\nAt the end of film production, Jackson's model was returned but had to be cut into sections in order to fit on the flat-bed trucks used to transport the model to Alberta. After arriving at the Reynolds Alberta Museum in Wetaskawin, Jackson and a team of volunteers reconstructed the model for display at the Abbotsford Air Show in 1997. A wind gust damaged the tail of the model in 1999 leading to its removal from an outside display area of the museum to be repaired indoors at the museum storage facility. Students and instructors from Edmonton's NAIT's Aircraft Structures program have volunteered close to 400 hours restoring the full-scale model to be displayed at the Reynolds-Alberta Museum in 2009 as part of celebrations marking the 100th anniversary of powered flight in Canada and the 50th anniversary of the cancellation of the Avro Arrow. The restored model remains in the museum's storage warehouse along with many other aircraft and cars and can be viewed by purchasing a warehouse tour during the summer months.\n\nAlthough highly acclaimed, receiving praise from film historian and former Avro employee Elwy Yost and winner of numerous awards including the Gemini that year, the mini-series was also criticized by critic Michael Bliss for its \"docu-drama\" style and departing from a strict factual account. The continued rebroadcasts and accompanying DVD releases have served to re-animate the controversy over the Arrow's cancellation and introduce the story to a new generation.\n\nScenes from the mini-series were used to create a Heritage Minute about the Arrow.\n\nAs of 2018 the miniseries has been released online for free on Canada Media Fund’s Encore+ YouTube channel.\n\nCanadian Society of Cinematographers Awards in 1997\nGemini Awards in 1998\nMotion Picture Sound Editors, USA in 1998\nWriters Guild of Canada in 1998\n\n\n"}
