Beginning as one of the two radio networks owned by the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), the independent Blue Network was born of a divestiture in 1942, arising from antitrust litigation, and is the direct predecessor of the American Broadcasting Company (ABC)—organized 1943–1945 as a separate independent radio network and later TV broadcaster.\n\nThe Blue Network dates to 1923, when the Radio Corporation of America acquired WJZ Newark from Westinghouse, which had established the station in 1921. WJZ moved to New York City in May of that year. When RCA commenced operations of WRC, Washington on August 1, 1923, the root of a network was born, though it did not operate under the name by which it would later become known. Radio historian Elizabeth McLeod states that it was not until 1924 that the \"Radio Group\" formally began network operations.\n\nThe core stations of the \"Radio Group\" were RCA's stations WJZ and WRC; the Westinghouse station WBZ, then in Springfield, Massachusetts; and WGY, the General Electric station in Schenectady, New York.\n\nRCA's principal rival prior to 1926 was the radio broadcasting department of the American Telephone & Telegraph Company. AT&T, starting in 1921, had been using this department as a test-bed for equipment being designed and manufactured by its Western Electric subsidiary.\n\nThe RCA stations operated at a significant disadvantage to their rival chain. AT&T used its own high-quality transmission lines, and declined to lease them out to competing entities, forcing RCA to use the telegraph lines of Western Union, which were not as well calibrated to voice transmission as the AT&T lines.\n\nNevertheless, the WJZ network sought to compete toe-to-toe with the AT&T network, which was built around a different New York station, WEAF (today's WFAN). For example, both stations sent announcer teams to cover the 1924 Democratic National Convention, which was held in Madison Square Garden in New York City. Promotional material produced in 1943 claimed certain \"firsts\" in broadcasting by WJZ, such as the first educational music program in April 1922, the first World Series broadcasts in 1922, and the first complete opera broadcast, \"The Flying Dutchman\", from the Manhattan Opera House.\n\nRCA (as well as its consortium partners General Electric and Westinghouse) were to receive a break in 1926, when AT&T made a corporate decision to exit the broadcasting business and focus on its telecommunications business.\n\nThe first step by AT&T was to create the Broadcasting Company of America on May 15, 1926, to hold its broadcasting assets, which included WEAF and WCAP in Washington. As reported in the press, this move was due to the growth in the radio broadcasting activities of AT&T and the special issues related thereto, though it would appear that subsequent activities in disposing of the assets of BCA may have also played a role in the decision. AT&T did in fact subsequently sell WEAF to RCA for $1 million in July 1926, a price that newspaper reports indicated was a substantial premium over what other stations were commanding in the marketplace, and represented a recognition of the status of WEAF in broadcasting, as well as its access to AT&T's lines. Indeed, the negotiations for the sale may have taken place very shortly after the creation of BCA, as Folder 129 in the NBC History Files at the Library of Congress contains a contract of sale for WEAF dated July 1, 1926. \"The Oakland Tribune\" stated that 4/5ths of the purchase price of WEAF could be attributed to goodwill and the line access. On July 28, 1926, the \"Washington Post\" reported in a front-page story that RCA had acquired WCAP. \"The Oakland Tribune\" reported the same day that WCAP had departed the field, and WRC would be operating on the frequency that they had shared, which was 640 AM.\n\nAs part of the reorganization of the broadcasting assets in the wake of the acquisitions, on September 13, 1926, the formation of the National Broadcasting Company was announced via newspaper advertisements, and on November 15, 1926 NBC's first broadcast was made. This first broadcast on November 15, 1926 marked NBC's de facto formation of the NBC Red Network from the WEAF network assets, using WEAF as the \"key station\"; this network in eventual popular image tended to broadcast the most popular entertainment programming. RCA merged its former radio operations into NBC, and on January 1, 1927, WJZ became the \"key station\" of the Blue Network when its network switch operations began. The network, again in eventual popular image, tended to place its focus more on news and public affairs programming, as well as the \"sustaining\", or non-sponsored shows.\n\nThe \"Decatur Review\" (Illinois) for Sunday, December 12, 1926 reported the following in an article describing a broadcast to be sponsored by the Victor Talking Machine Company and aired the following New Year's Day, January 1, 1927, which is a description of this first Blue Network broadcast—note that it makes it clear that January 1, 1927 marked the debut of the Blue Network:\n\"TWO BIG NETWORKS: The network to be used for the first concert will consist of a combination of chains of stations affiliated with WEAF and WJZ, New York. It is also announced that this opening Victor program inaugurates a new chain system to be operated by the National Broadcasting Company, with WJZ as the \"key\" station. This new chain, which will be known as the \"blue\" network, will allow simultaneous broadcasting from WJZ through WBZ, Springfield and Boston, KDKA, Pittsburgh, and KYW, Chicago. For broadcasting of the first program, therefore, the \"blue\" network will be joined with the \"red\" network, as the WEAF chain is designated, as well as other stations in various cities. Following the New Year's night program, the concerts will be given bi-monthly, through the \"blue\" network (...)\"\n\nAllegedly, the color designations came from the way the networks were represented on maps, with red lines (or pushpins) denoting the WEAF network circuits, and blue the WJZ circuits.\n\nThe Red and Blue Networks shared a common pool of engineers and facilities, and would, on occasion, broadcast the same events. There are two early examples, from the biggest news events of 1927. On May 20, 1927, both of the NBC networks covered the return of Charles Lindbergh to America from his trans-Atlantic flight, star announcer Graham McNamee doing the honors. Three months later, a combined hookup of 67 stations on the two networks presented the second Dempsey–Tunney fight, broadcast by McNamee and NBC colleague Phillips Carlin. See Elizabeth McLeod's discussion of surviving NBC broadcast material from this era.\n\nA slightly later example of cooperation came on the evening of Sunday, December 1, 1929, when the famed \"Laird of the Music Halls\", Sir Harry Lauder, appeared on a coast-to-coast hookup that originated from KFI in Los Angeles (later an NBC Red station, but at this time part of NBC's West Coast \"Orange Network\"), but was distributed by WJZ, which, as noted, was the key station of the Blue Network; advertisements suggest that certain NBC Red stations, as well as stations in the Orange Network, supplemented the network. A description of this broadcast is contained in a 1930 pamphlet put out by the Enna Jettick Shoe Company; Enna Jettick sponsored the first of Lauder's performances that night on its \"Enna Jettick Melodies\" show, which was followed later by another performance during the time ordinarily used by \"The Collier Hour\".\n\nAt least as late as January 1939, in spite of the fact that by this time NBC was seeking to differentiate the images of its NBC Red and NBC Blue networks (see below), it would still arrange for special, joint broadcasts, such as a special two-hour presentation of \"The Magic Key of RCA\" musical program (normally an NBC Blue program, sponsored by RCA's Victor records division) entitled \"Salute to 1939.\"\n\nIronically, even though the Blue Network generally was not given the more popular programs, it was the network that broadcast \"Amos 'n Andy\" at the height of its popularity in the early 1930s, when on average over half of the nation's radio audience would tune in to the show. During the 1932–1933 season, Standard Oil of New Jersey (Esso) sponsored an unusual program, the \"Five-Star Theater\", which each weeknight presented a show in a different format. The marquee show in this cycle was \"Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel\", which starred Groucho Marx and Chico Marx. Considering the show's relatively early (7:30 p.m. ET) time slot, it did rather well in the ratings, but it could not compete with the much stronger ratings produced by Esso's arch-rival Texaco, which sponsored Ed Wynn on NBC Red, and the show ended after one year.\n\nMore commonly, the Blue Network would operate as a quasi-\"farm team\" for the Red Network, in terms of entertainment programs. Bob Hope (in 1935 and again in 1937), Jack Benny (in 1932), \"Fibber McGee and Molly\" (in 1935), and \"Information, Please!\" (in 1938) are all examples of shows that debuted on the Blue Network before eventually transitioning over to larger audiences on the Red Network.\n\nOn occasion, shows would make brief stops at NBC Blue before moving elsewhere, such as the \"Lux Radio Theatre\" (1934–35) and Will Rogers' program (1933), both of which would move to CBS. \n\nAt some level, the Blue Network was known in the late 1920s and early 1930s for its children's programming. There are at least two volumes extant, from an Akron-based publishing house, which are collections of stories which purport to have been part of Blue Network programs. A copy of one, in the collection of E.O. Costello, shows a cover with two children listening to a late 1920s-style radio, from which shimmering images of fairy-tale characters are emerging. Other than the title (and the radio on the cover), the precise nature of the ties to the Blue Network is not known; the book does not even make direct reference to the National Broadcasting Company. It can also be said that this is an indication that the Blue Network had a well-established identity of its own by 1929.\n\nThe descriptions of the material contained in the NBC History Files at the Library of Congress appear to indicate that at some level, there was discontent with the way NBC was managing the Blue Network vis-à-vis the Red Network. For example, one folder in the NBC History Files contains a three-page letter dated June 28, 1934, from station WSYR in Syracuse, New York, which complains of the neglect of the Blue Network in favor of the Red Network. This point can said to be reinforced firstly by a memorandum dated September 18, 1935, in which the Blue complained about its lack of access to broadcasts of the World Series, and secondly by a letter dated shortly after that, on October 5, 1935, which is a communication from Hearst Radio complaining that \"Amos 'n Andy\" and the Al Pearce programs had been moved from the Blue Network to the Red Network, and complaining in general about the weakness of the Blue's programming. Indeed, the NBC History Files contain a February 1937 in-house memorandum so caustic of the performance of the Blue Network that the author's name was redacted from the document.\n\nA significant issue with the NBC Blue Network may have been its size. It started, in January 1927, with 7 stations, had grown to 17 by the end of 1929, but still had only 33 stations by 1937. This would have made it significantly smaller than its rivals. In 1938, Mutual had 107 affiliates, and CBS had 114; the Blue Network, by contrast, was not able to blanket the United States when NBC Red sold out its time, with the result that during 1937–1938, the Blue Network's revenues were generally falling, while NBC Red's increased. Radio historian Elizabeth McLeod has noted that as of 1938, NBC had 23 stations in its core \"Basic Red\" group, and 24 in its \"Basic Blue\" group, with 107 stations that could be Red or Blue depending on the needs of a sponsor; the relative ratings (and thus revenues) for NBC Red programs versus NBC Blue counterparts suggests that sponsors chose to use Red more often than Blue.\n\nPerhaps more in line with the common perception of the Blue Network as a smaller, but more high-brow and public affairs-centered network was the fact that it was the original home of the NBC Symphony Orchestra broadcasts, led by Maestro Arturo Toscanini. In a similar vein, one of the Blue Network's longest running programs was \"America's Town Meeting of the Air\", a current-affairs discussion program. Both Lowell Thomas and Walter Winchell's news programs were also broadcast over the Blue Network. Both of these shows were the Blue's highest rated programs in the late 1930s and early 1940s. In an interesting variation on the talent shows hosted by Major Bowes, the Sherwin-Williams paint company sponsored the Metropolitan Opera \"Auditions of the Air\" for a number of years on Sunday afternoons in the 1930s and 1940s, in which singers competed for a chance to win contracts with the famed opera troupe. \"The National Farm and Home Hour\", a show backed for many years by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, was one of the Blue Network's standout daytime programs, and would be a part of its lineup from 1929 until March 1945, when the program shifted to NBC.\nAlong with the NBC Symphony Orchestra broadcasts, the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts were part of the \"crown jewels\" of NBC Blue. A sober, dignified pamphlet issued by the network in 1937 stated that the broadcasts were under RCA sponsorship, and \"[t]hrough the medium of nationwide NBC Network broadcasting, Grand Opera has been given to the entire nation. No longer is it reserved for the privileged few – now even the most isolated listeners throughout the United States are able to enjoy the world's finest music at their own firesides. The National Broadcasting Company (...) is proud to be the means of bringing the Metropolitan Opera to American radio listeners.\" The pamphlet notes that 78 stations broadcast these opera performances in 1937, and that reception for the program was \"nationwide\", something moderately unusual for an NBC Blue broadcast.\n\nRadio historian Elizabeth McLeod has suggested, aside from a brief period where NBC Red and NBC Blue had different chime-sequences in the late 1920s and early 1930s, the two networks were *not* differentiated for many years, which would certainly be consistent with the roster of shows described above. She points out, with some justice, that NBC Red also broadcast a number of high-brow programs such as \"The Voice of Firestone\", \"The Atwater Kent Hour\", and the \"Cities Service Concerts\". Furthermore, she points out that until the 1936–1937 period, the \"back office\" support for the networks was the same, and often stations would shift from one network to another, depending on sponsor needs. It was only when the Federal Communications Commission began investigating network practices, McLeod believes, that efforts were made by RCA to differentiate the two networks, and to fully position NBC Blue as a high-brow/public affairs network. (In the same light, it has been suggested that the congressional pressure was the real reason the NBC Symphony Orchestra was created.)\n\nThe NBC History Files at the Library of Congress lend support to the notion that NBC was gradually groping for a way to differentiate the Red Network from the Blue Network. For example, they contain a confidential memorandum, dated May 13, 1936, which sets forth a network policy against mixing the Red and Blue network stations. (Compare and contrast this with the way the Harry Lauder broadcast of 1929 was handled, above.) There also exists an October 1938 sales force memorandum, which contains talking points on how to differentiate the Blue Network from the Red Network and CBS. Even as far back as December 1932, NBC had set forth a policy banning specific references not only to CBS, but even to the Red Network.\n\nOf note is the fact that NBC began to step up efforts to expand the network; while it had 33 stations in 1937, this total had nearly tripled by January 1941, when the network had 92 stations coast to coast.\n\nThese efforts to expand the network are evidenced by an NBC publication in late 1936, \" Great and Growing Greater\", which described efforts to increase both the size and quality of Blue Network stations. Among the improvements cited and proposed were increasing the broadcast power of WJZ and KDKA to 50,000 watts each, adding new stations to the group such as WEAN, WICC and WEBR, adding a Pacific Coast network (with KGO, KECA, KFSD, KEX, KJR and KGA) and expanding the daytime power of such stations as KOIL, KWK and KSO. This ad campaign, in a booklet tipped into the book, also showed a lengthy list of sponsors that had purchased Blue Network time. As the book stated: \"All of these additions and improvements are daily increasing the effectiveness of the NBC Blue Network. All contribute considerably to the listener's pleasure and to the advertiser's sales results.\"\n\nIn the months leading up to the January 1942 spinoff of the Blue Network, NBC undertook vigorous steps to create separate brand images for the Red and Blue Networks. To a certain extent, this had been going on since at least the summer of 1939, when \"Time\" magazine indicated that NBC was undertaking an extensive build-up of NBC Blue. In both the fall of 1937, and the fall of 1941, NBC would specifically identify a program as being broadcast on the \"Red Network of the National Broadcasting Company\", and at least in the fall of 1941, would have a similar tag for the Blue Network. An example of this buildup comes in \"Alice in Sponsor-Land\", a publication put out by RCA some time in mid-1941 to market that network's shows. This book focuses squarely on the Red Network, describing its entertainment programming, without any reference to the Blue Network. Above the lineup of stations in the back of the volume is the tag-line: \"This is the Red Network of the National Broadcasting Company.\" In addition, throughout the book are slogans such as \"Any time is Good Time on NBC Red!\" This book, in part, demonstrates exactly how NBC differentiated the Red Network from the Blue Network in the fall of 1941, when, as noted, the Blue Network was still a part of NBC.\n\nWhat follows are some examples of the programming on NBC Blue that illustrate the gradual shift in tone.\n\nThe official website for Helen Hayes shows a number of programs that she did for NBC Blue during this time, including a Eugene O'Neill play cycle in August 1937, two different dramatic series of her own in 1935–1936 (one sponsored by General Foods), and an appearance on a Blue series in 1940, one which brought famous people who would explain why a particular book has been their favorite.\n\nThe \"preview\" section of the November 28, 1938 edition of \"Time\" gives some idea of the kind of programming that the Blue Network carried. On Friday, November 25 at 4 p.m., it carried a speech by then-Secretary of State Cordell Hull. Later that night, it carried the welterweight championship fight from Madison Square Garden, followed by Wagnerian opera from Chicago's Lyric Opera. Saturday, November 26 shows that the Blue carried both the Army–Navy football game and the NBC Symphony Orchestra. The \"Town Meeting of the Air\" on Thursday night carried a debate among economists as to whether an economic plan for world peace was possible.\nFor one season in the early 1940s, a high-profile sponsored program on the Blue was \"The Cavalcade of America\", a show dramatizing historical events which was sponsored by DuPont. The show, which debuted in 1935 on CBS and moved to the Blue in January 1940, was created at a time when the firm was under attack for being, in effect, a \"merchant of death\", and this show, which focused on American historical figures, was one way DuPont tried to burnish its image. Certainly, the show had high production values, as can be witnessed by its use of Raymond Massey for a show in February 1940 on Abraham Lincoln, as described in the February 26, 1940 issue of \"Time\". It was also known for the use of university professors to vet the historical accuracy of the stories, as well as scripts by future Pulitzer Prize-winner Arthur Miller. (This show would eventually stay with NBC Red and NBC, starting in 1941, and the network would continue to broadcast the show even into the age of television).\n\nAn interesting perspective can be seen on one of the most dramatic days in the history of network radio. On the morning/afternoon of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, while the first attack wave was over Oahu, NBC Blue was broadcasting \"The Inspector General\", as part of its \"Great Plays\" program, while NBC Red was broadcasting a program with popular bandleader Sammy Kaye. At 4 p.m., ET, the Blue's broadcasts of the National Vespers was interrupted by various news reports. Later on in the evening, at 6:30 p.m. and 6:45 p.m., Drew Pearson's and Eleanor Roosevelt's regular broadcasts are heard, followed at 7 p.m. by a news roundup show that competed with Jack Benny, and later on \"Bible Week\" opposite the \"Chase and Sanborn Hour\" with Edgar Bergen. (The Blue did have the popular \"Inner Sanctum\" mystery anthology series later that night at 8:30, followed in turn by its number one show with Walter Winchell.) Lastly, of interest to those who may recall the satiric references in Warner Bros. cartoons of the era, at 10 p.m., the Blue carried \"The Goodwill Hour\" with John J. Anthony, dispensing advice to those who sought it, and who presumably were not tuned into Phil Spitalny's orchestra on the Red network.\n\nNBC seriously considered during the late 1930s, disposing of the Blue Network on its own initiative. There are substantial materials contained in the NBC History Files at the Library of Congress on this point. The fact that David Sarnoff, the head of RCA, was involved in these discussions indicates the high level at which this proposal was given consideration. A plain reading of the finding guide at the Library of Congress on the NBC History Files does not disclose the precise nature of these discussions, though the fact that these discussions existed is of record. In 1943, after the Blue Network had been spun off (but before its eventual sale), a promotional publication noted that: \n\"As far back as 1932, a group of executives of the National Broadcasting Company conceived the idea that The Blue Network could progress faster and serve its stations, its advertisers and the listening public much better if, instead of being a part of NBC it were to become an independent network.\" \n\nDuring the 1930s, accusations were leveled at both NBC and CBS, in part by their rival Mutual, that the two senior network systems engaged in a series of anticompetitive activities, by locking up talent through in-house talent bureaus, and tightly tying together the system of affiliated stations through onerous contracts.\n\nIn May 1940, after a three-year investigation, the Federal Communications Commission (which had had oversight over radio broadcasting since 1934) issued a scathing report (the \"Report on Chain Broadcasting\") attacking the affiliation policies of NBC and CBS, as well as the talent booking agency practices. The report proposed limiting each network to one affiliated station per city, which would have had a direct impact on NBC's dual-network ownership. In May 1941, the FCC went a step further and issued formal rules to break up what it perceived to be monopolies in radio; one of these rules specifically barred a network from operating more than one hookup, which would have been aimed directly at NBC's ownership of its two networks, in a manner even more explicit than the June 1940 report.\n\nSubsequent congressional hearings in the fall of 1941 resulted in the FCC watering down the rules, but the reprieve was short-lived, as the antitrust division of the Department of Justice, on December 31, 1941, filed an antitrust action against NBC and CBS, seeking to break up the networks' methods of operation. Mutual, at the same time, filed an antitrust suit of its own, in the amount of $10.275 million, according to the January 12, 1942 edition of \"Time\".\n\nThis account by \"Time\" describes at least one of the accusations leveled against NBC by Mutual, from an affidavit by Mutual's general manager. In the fall of 1941, Mutual debuted a comedy-variety series sponsored by Ballantine Ale, called \"Three Ring Time\", starring Milton Berle and Charles Laughton. The show was set to debut on a 77-station network, but 14 of these stations were under contract to NBC, which had the power to exercise options on the most desirable time, in cities where there was limited competition. NBC eventually exercised options for six of these stations, with the result that \"Three Ring Time\" was being carried simultaneously on NBC Blue and Mutual.\nWhile the antitrust suits were pending, NBC and CBS had appealed to the courts regarding the ability of the FCC to regulate the operations of radio networks. While these appeals were in progress, NBC started the process of formally separating the operations of the Red Network and the Blue Network, a process which had begun in 1939 with the formation of a separate sales department for the Blue Network and which continued into 1940 and 1941 with the formation of other departments for the Blue Network. NBC began to specifically identify the networks, contrary to its general practice, and began to divide personnel and facilities; eventually, it formed a separate corporate entity for the Blue Network on January 8, 1942, \"Blue Network Company, Inc.\" From this date on, while NBC still maintained ownership of the Blue Network, it was for most purposes an entirely separate network. NBC Red at this point became known as simply NBC.\n\nIn June 1942 the United States Supreme Court upheld the jurisdiction of the FCC over the issuance of rules relating to chain broadcasting. While the FCC litigation continued in the wake of this ruling, the public and private antitrust litigation was held in abeyance.\n\nOn May 10, 1943 the Supreme Court (\"National Broadcasting Co. v. United States\", 319 U.S. 190) upheld the right of the FCC to regulate practically everything that was radio, by sustaining the jurisdiction of the FCC to regulate the contractual relations of the major networks with affiliated stations. Efforts in late 1943 before the Senate Interstate Commerce Committee to obtain legislation to, in effect, reverse the decision went nowhere.\n\nThe January 11, 1943 edition of \"Time\" states that seven investment houses, three insurance companies, two manufacturers, a daily newspaper, and an industrialist had all taken serious looks at purchasing the network. However, with the ruling from the Supreme Court, NBC was now spurred to take vigorous action to sell the Blue Network. The bidding came down to three groups, with an initial bid of $6 million, which was raised in sequence by rivals to $6.5 and then $7 million. In late July, 1943, the investment banking firm of Dillon, Read & Co. made a bid of $7.8 million.\n\nOn July 30, 1943, just over two months after the court's ruling, RCA announced the sale of the network to American Broadcasting System, Inc., a firm controlled by Edward J. Noble, a former undersecretary of commerce who was better known as the chairman of Life Savers Corp. The price was announced as $8 million. This was followed by a petition to the FCC to approve the sale, which was filed on August 13.\n\nOne of the significant issues surrounding the sale of the Blue Network involved the network's practices regarding \"controversial\" topics and proponents. The network, citing the code of the National Association of Broadcasters, declined to sell time to labor organizations, cooperatives, and other organizations advocating \"controversial topics\", but did give them free air time, provided there was an opportunity for the other side to be heard. On August 27, 1943, the Congress of Industrial Organizations filed a brief in a petition to intervene in the FCC proceedings on the network sale. The CIO complained that the NAB code regarding \"controversial\" broadcasts inhibited its ability to buy airtime. While the FCC denied the CIO's petition to intervene, it did invite the CIO to give testimony in the hearings.\n\nAt the hearings held on September 10, 1943, FCC Chairman James L. Fly roundly denounced the policy of the Blue Network in refusing to sell airtime, but granting air time for free, to proponents of controversial broadcasts. He colorfully described the policy as chasing would-be purchasers from the front of the shop, but \"directing them to the back door for a handout.\" Mark Woods, the head of the Blue Network, defended the policy, stating that it was in compliance with the NAB code. When Edward J. Noble testified at the hearings held on September 20, 1943, he was questioned closely by Chairman Fly as to the policies regarding the refusal to sell air time to labor organizations, cooperatives and other special interest groups. Noble was directed by Chairman Fly at this hearing to submit a statement as to what the policy would be of the Blue Network in terms of \"the expansion of the mechanisms of free speech.\" On October 3, 1943, Noble released a letter to the FCC in which it was stated that the Blue Network would meet \"with an open mind\" all requests for broadcasting time, \"considering each on the merits\", and excluding none on the basis of ideas or personality. Certainly, not all were pleased by Chairman Fly's stance. Columnist David Lawrence, in his October 7, 1943 column, thought that the FCC had overstepped its authority in attempting to force the Blue Network to change its policies regarding the sale of airtime.\n\nNoble's written response seems to have been sufficient. The sale was approved by the FCC on October 12, 1943. Noble was forced to divest himself of New York station WMCA, which he had owned since 1940, but his American Broadcasting System, Inc., the entity formed to be the parent of the Blue Network, acquired WJZ, additional stations in Chicago and San Francisco, as well as land-line leases, certain studio facilities and leased studio facilities, and the affiliation system.\n\nFollowing the sale, the Department of Justice dropped its antitrust proceedings against NBC on October 17, 1943, having previously dropped proceedings against CBS on October 11, and the federal courts, upon its motion, dismissed Mutual's antitrust claims against CBS and NBC.\n\nIn the April 21, 1947 issue of \"Time\", Mark Woods called the Blue Network of 1942 (that is, just before the sale) \"a dump.\" The article describes the then-116 station network as the home of cast-off speeches and classical music, which had only generated $14 million in revenue. It could, perhaps, be argued that Woods was denigrating the state of the Blue Network at that time, to contrast with the relative success of the network later in the 1940s; this is possible in light of the fact that the Blue Network had been profitable in 1942. Woods and the rest of the management team, after the sale to Noble, began to take steps to make the Blue Network more competitive with NBC and CBS.\n\nAn early step was to obtain a deep pocketed backer. Noble, on December 28, 1943, sold a 12.5% stake to Time Inc., and a similar stake to advertising executive Chester LaRoche, for $500,000 each. Smaller stakes were taken by Blue Network executives Mark Woods (president) and Edgar Kobak (executive vice-president, who would the next year leave the Blue for Mutual).\n\nDuring the 1943–1945 period, the Blue Network used many of the NBC broadcasting facilities, including the Radio City facilities in New York (see the KATE ad, above), as well as studio space in Los Angeles. The back of the ticket for \"Fun Valley\", a show starring veteran comedian Al Pearce, sponsored by Dr. Pepper and broadcast on Sunday afternoons in 1944, makes reference to both Blue Network Company, Inc. and the National Broadcasting Company, Inc. in terms of the rules and regulations audience members had to obey.\n\nOf obvious import were steps taken to preserve the best programming the network had, and make improvements; these were happening in the period immediately prior to, and following, the sale of the network. While the Blue Network did lose a few programs to NBC, such as \"Quiz Kids\" and \"Duffy's Tavern\" (more shows that debuted or had a previous run on the Blue; see Lackmann, op. cit.) and the NBC Symphony Orchestra (Lackmann, op. cit.), it did retain one highly rated show, the \"Jergen's Journal\" with Walter Winchell, which managed to compete successfully with NBC's powerhouse Sunday night lineup (it was the 11th-ranked program for all of 1943–1944, and Blue's only program in the top 20). The Blue Network also retained the rights to broadcast the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts; Milton Cross was the host for NBC, Blue, ABC, CBS, and the opera's own broadcasts from 1931 through 1975. This was in spite of the fact that NBC did not want to assign the rights to either the \"Town Meeting of the Air\" or the Metropolitan Opera broadcasts to the Blue Network.\n\nIn an interview with \"Time\" published on January 11, 1943, Woods noted that the Blue Network was seeking to differentiate itself from NBC and CBS by the aggressive use of transcriptions, contrary to the practice of the larger networks. This would have its full fruition when Bing Crosby started transcribing his prime-time shows in 1946.\n\nIn certain respects, the Blue made attempts to grab the spotlight with unusual broadcasts. On December 25, 1942, the Coca-Cola Company sponsored an all-day broadcast on the network, a \"Victory Parade's Christmas Party of Spotlight Bands\". The hiring, in 1943, of noted bandleader Paul Rodgers as Director of Music was an attempt by the network, in its own words, to strengthen the entire musical schedule, as well as obtain a prominent figure. The \"Metropolitan Auditions of the Air\", discussed above, had moved to the Blue Network by 1943 as well, joining the Metropolitan Opera broadcasts and the Boston Symphony Orchestra.\n\nNews continued to be a priority for the network; indeed, Raymond Swing would win a Peabody Award for the network in 1944 for his news commentary. A 1943 promotional pamphlet listed Swing, Walter Winchell, Martin Agronsky, Drew Pearson, Lowell Thomas and Dorothy Thompson, among others, as part of \"the most impressive roster of news analysts and commentators on the air today.\" Newsman George Hicks was on a landing craft heading to the Normandy invasion beaches on D-Day when it was strafed by enemy planes, the sound of the combat being broadcast. The network did have some difficulty with its news commentators during the war, however. The February 22, 1943 edition of Time notes that Woods had to clamp down on both Walter Winchell and Drew Pearson for over-aggressive name calling in their broadcasts, much to their dismay.\n\nSeveral programs can be cited to show how the Blue Network was striving to reach beyond its previous reputation, and compete head-on with CBS and NBC as a stand-alone network.\n\nOne ambitious broadcast, copies of which are generally available to collectors of old-time radio broadcasts, was a special two-hour program broadcast on Christmas Day, 1944. Entitled \"Christmas on the Blue\", the show was emceed by Gracie Fields, and featured, among other stars, Joe E. Brown, The Andrews Sisters, Ed Wynn, Paul Whiteman and others. The show also featured broadcasts of overseas servicemen sending greetings and well wishes to their loved ones at home, something unusual for the era.\n\nOne of the pairings on this special program involved Wendell Niles, a long-time announcer on many radio shows, including Bob Hope's. The Blue Network gave him and partner Don Prindle a comedy series, \"Niles and Prindle\", which is referenced in the special as being scheduled for a debut the following month. It was said to involve two friends \"who argued about everything\", and had a brief run in 1945. It was certainly unusual for the Blue Network to attempt to convert a long-time announcer into a featured comedy star, and in this sense, \"Niles and Prindle\", if not unique (given that Graham McNamee was the \"Perfect Foil\" to Ed Wynn), it must be said to be at least quite singular.\n\nOf interest to animation fans was a show called \"Nitwit Court\", which sought to do to John J. Anthony's \"The Goodwill Hour\" what \"It Pays to Be Ignorant\" did to \"Information, Please!\". Host Ransom Sherman would pose problems to a jury consisting of Arthur Q. Bryan, as \"Willow\", a man with a lisp, Mel Blanc, as \"Hornblower\", a fumbling motorboat owner, and Sara Berner as \"Bubbles Lowbridge\", a not terribly bright woman.\n\nStrengthening the affiliate station list was a matter of importance to the network. While the network had 116 stations in January 1942 and 155 stations as of June 1943, this still meant that it could only offer to advertisers coverage of approximately 76% of the radio homes in the United States. In this sense, the moves by the FCC to loosen the provisions of the contracts binding affiliated stations to networks helped the Blue Network. This allowed it to pick up a few additional stations in 1944, including (ironically) a few from the Mutual Broadcasting System. This was one of its priorities, as the Blue Network had inherited smaller and less powerful stations than NBC and CBS.\n\nFinally, a major priority of the Blue Network was to form a new identity, one that would mark a break with the past. In December, 1945, the FCC approved the transfer of The Blue Network, Inc.'s broadcast licenses to American Broadcasting Company. Beginning on January 22, 1945, the network's opening and closing announcements changed to \"The Blue Network of the American Broadcasting Company.\" Starting February 18, the same wording was instituted as the network outcue for station breaks. On June 15, 1945, the Blue Network formally changed its name to the American Broadcasting Company. They were not alone in desiring this catchy acronym. Two prior claimants were bought out prior to June 1945, and in negotiations with the Associated Broadcasting Corp. in December 1945, it acquired the rights to the name \"ABC\" from yet a third party. From June 1945 forward, the entity has been known generally as the American Broadcasting Company, and reference should be made to that entry for its subsequent history.\n\nThe souvenir program for the \" Maurice B. Sachs Amateur Hour \" broadcast of Sunday, September 30, 1945 refers to the broadcast as coming from \"Blue Network Studio A.\" Even into 1947, in some markets, ABC would promote its shows with the tag-line \"It's a Blue Network Program!\"\n\nAs of June 1945, commercial television in the United States had been frozen, owing to the lower level of priorities given to it as compared to war work. Furthermore, ABC was generally slow to move into television broadcasting. It did win approval to build five television stations; the first, WJZ-TV in New York was completed in the summer of 1948. WJZ-TV was followed by stations in Chicago and Detroit later in 1948; and San Francisco and Los Angeles during 1949–all five stations were assigned to broadcast on channel 7. Until those stations were built, ABC had to lease time and studio facilities from other stations including DuMont network New York flagship WABD, as well as other stations in Philadelphia and Washington which eventually helped form the core of the ABC television network. It might be supposed that the Blue Network never existed in television, but as noted above, the Blue Network did make at least a few known forays into television prior to the June 1945 name change. For example, the Blue Network applied for a construction permit for a TV station in the upper VHF band, but all such applications were shelved during the war years. Experiments were also conducted by the Blue Network in television program production before it permanently became ABC and formally opened a network under the ABC name in 1948. The script for a February 25, 1945 broadcast of \"Ladies Be Seated\", which was a relatively popular audience-participation/stunt game show on Blue Network radio, still exists, and is reprinted in full in Ritchie; it is, in fact, the script for the first broadcast. It was hosted by Johnny Olson, who would later become the long-running announcer on most of CBS's Goodson-Todman-produced game shows, most notably \"Match Game\" and \"The Price Is Right\". Technically, this was not a network broadcast, as it was broadcast locally on WRGB, the General Electric television station in Schenectady, New York. However, the opening title card, according to the script, was for \"The Blue Network of the American Broadcasting Company.\" No video copy of this broadcast is known to exist.\n\nAs noted above, during the 1930s and 1940s, the Blue Network was divided into groups of stations. The core group of stations was known as \"Basic Blue\", and covered the Northeast United States/New England and portions of the Upper Midwest, around the Great Lakes area. The Southern Blue Network covered the Deep South, the Mountain Blue Group the Mountain states, the Pacific Coast Blue Network the Pacific Coast states, and the Southwestern Blue Group the Oklahoma-Texas region.\n\nA pamphlet published by the American Rolling Mill Co. in connection with a radio talk on \"The Miracle of Steel\" given on the Blue Network on April 9, 1939 has a listing of the Blue Network stations participating in this broadcast. They are as follows:\n\nOther Blue Network basic stations in 1939 were WABY (Albany, New York); WJTN (Jamestown, New York); WRTD (Richmond, Virginia); WLEU (Erie, Pennsylvania); CFCF (Montreal, Quebec) and WMFF in Plattsburgh, New York.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2097063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097063", "title": "Small Arms Protective Insert", "text": "Small Arms Protective Insert\n\nThe Small Arms Protective Insert (SAPI) is a ceramic trauma plate used by the United States Armed Forces. It was first used in the Interceptor Body Armor, a ballistic vest. It is now also used in the Improved Outer Tactical Vest as well as the Modular Tactical Vest, in addition to commercially available \"plate carriers\". The Kevlar Interceptor vest itself is designed to stop projectiles up to and including 9×19mm Parabellum submachine gun rounds, in addition to fragmentation. To protect against higher-velocity rifle rounds, SAPI plates are needed.\n\nIn May 2005, the U.S. Armed Forces began replacing the standard Small Arms Protective Insert plates with the Enhanced Small Arms Protective Insert (ESAPI). \nAn ESAPI provides protection from .30-06 Springfield M2 armor-piercing (AP) with a steel or tungsten penetrator in accordance with the NIJ Level IV standard, but costs about $600 per plate, 50% more than SAPI plates. They are produced by Ceradyne, BAE Systems, and ArmorWorks Enterprises.\n\nA call for a next generation plate, to stop even greater velocity threats than the ESAPI plate was issued by the U.S. Army in 2008. The X Threat Small Arms Protective Insert plates are specifically allowed scalar or flexible systems, and asked for better coverage, with less than a pound of additional weight. XSAPI did in fact offer slightly better protection, at the cost of more weight and thicker armor profile. \n\nThe XSAPI is intended to protect against an \"X-Threat\", which is able to be inferred from another source to be the M993 7.62 NATO armor piercing projectile. In addition, there is record of the FBI utilizing the plate for their purposes on May 2011.\n\nThe plates were developed in response to a perceived threat of AP projectiles in Iraq and Afghanistan. Over 120,000 inserts were procured; however, the AP threats they were meant to stop never materialized, and the plates were put into storage.\n\nThe standard plate for the Interceptor body armor is made of boron carbide or silicon carbide ceramic. New ESAPI plates are also made of boron carbide. The standard plates are not given an NIJ rating, as they are tested in accordance with specific protocols for the military and not the NIJ's testing. Military testing calls for survivability of three hits from the round marked on the plate - for standard SAPI, of a caliber up to 7.62×51mm NATO M80 ball and of a muzzle velocity up to 2,750 ft/s (840 m/s). For ESAPI, a .30-06 Springfield M2 armor-piercing (AP) (.30-06 black-tip armor-piercing) cartridge. This performance is only assured when backed by the soft armor of the OTV (or any soft armor which meets military requirements for protection). The ceramic plate is backed with a shield made of Spectra, a material up to 40% stronger than Kevlar, to trap any fragments of either plate or projectile and prevent them from injuring the wearer.\n\nSAPI plates meant for body armor come in front and back plates which are identical, and smaller side plates. The front and back plates come in five sizes. Their dimensions are the following:\n\nFront and back SAPI plates:\n\nESAPI plates are the same size but slightly greater in weight.\n\nSide SAPI (SSAPI) torso side plates, and their replacement, the Enhanced Side Ballistic Inserts (ESBI), have identical weights and dimensions. ESBI plates can be replaced with size X-Small ESAPI plates (by unfolding an extension built into the bottom of the ESBI Carrier assembly), if permitted by the unit commander.\n\nThe mechanism of effect lies in absorbing and dissipating the projectile's kinetic energy in local shattering of the ceramic plate and blunting the bullet material on the hard ceramic. The Spectra backing then spreads the energy of the impact to a larger area and stops the fragments, reducing the likelihood of fatal injury to the wearer. The same principle is used for the ceramic tiles used for the armored cockpits of some military airplanes, and the anti-spallation liners used in modern armored personnel carriers.\n\nIt is a false assumption that eliminating the penetration of a projectile into the body by using a personal armour system ensures that the wearer will not experience serious injury or death. Blunt force trauma can cause fatal damage to internal organs.\n\n"}

While there, he gives his grandson, Dennis Xu (Dennis Zhu), a treatment of Gua Sha to treat a slight fever (being unable to read English labels of medicine). Social workers, however, mistake the harmless traditional Chinese medical treatment for child abuse due to the obvious marks left on Dennis' back. The life of the family is sent into turmoil when Dennis is taken away by the child protection agency. In court, the prosecution includes Datong's inclusion of a Chinese legendary character Sun Wukong (Chinese traditional: 孫悟空; simplified: 孙悟空) in his design of a violent video game. The prosecution implies that since Datong includes violence in his game, he values it. Datong, who is furious, insists that the prosecution does not understand the cultural value of Sun Wukong and that the icon's inclusion does not mean he abuses his son. He insists that what he does in his job does not relate to how he runs his home. Meanwhile, Grandfather Xu leaves America because he finds that the living environment is really not suitable for him, as he does not want to live in a place where a simple, harmless treatment like Gua Sha, which is so common in China, is treated as child abuse.

Many of its series were produced in association with Universal Television; most of them aired on the NBC television network in the U.S. (coincidentally, Universal is the majority owner of NBC today).\n\nThe estate of Jack Webb now owns the full rights to the company's library, with the exception of the original 1954 feature film version of \"Dragnet\" (originally released by Warner Bros., but now owned by Universal Pictures), and the films \"Pete Kelly's Blues\" and \"The D.I.\" (which are controlled by original distributor Warner Bros.).\n\nHowever, Webb's three seminal series, \"Dragnet\" (the 1967–1970 incarnation), \"Emergency!,\" and \"Adam-12,\" are now available on DVD from either Universal or Shout! Factory, the first two under license from the Webb estate, the latter in-house since Universal was reassigned the \"Adam-12\" series copyright. The MeTV and Antenna TV Television Networks also air episodes of the Mark VII Limited shows.\n\nAll series aired on NBC except as noted.\n\n\nMark VII's final production was \"The 25th Man,\" an unsold television pilot that aired on NBC in 1982.\n\nMark VII Limited was known for its famous production logo attached to the end of its productions. The logo, in use in one form or another for much of the company's existence, showed the hands of Jack Webb's construction foreman Harold C. Nyby holding a hammer and a stamp against a sheet of metal. As a timpani roll played, he struck two blows on the stamp and then moved his hands to reveal the Roman numeral VII indented into the sheet. \n\nThe origin of the name \"Mark VII\" is unclear. One source said the name meant nothing, and that it was made up over coffee one day. Another source says Webb just liked the look of the Roman numerals.\n\nThe Mark VII production logo is one of the more recognizable logos of its time and has become iconic, with many instances of filmmakers and production companies paying homage to it in various ways, most notably Williams Street Productions of Adult Swim/Cartoon Network programming, whose logo utilizes the same drumroll/hammer clinks soundtrack seen on the 1967 Mark VII logo. The Mark VII Limited logo was also spoofed at the end of the 1954 Woody Woodpecker cartoon \"Under The Counter Spy\". In this spoof, the man accidentally hits his thumb with the hammer and yells \"OUCH!\", then pulls the hammer away to reveal the ending title card. The man's voice was supplied by Daws Butler. Gunther-Wahl Productions used a similar card at the end of its cartoons.\n\nThe logo was remade multiple times during the company's history. It is reported that the early logos featured Jack Webb's hands but the later logos featured Ivan Martin's. Ivan was the director of studio operations for 20th Century Fox at the time of his retirement but worked in the studio's visual effects department during production of the logos.\n\nFilmmaker Spike Lee pays homage to this famous logo in the logo for his own production company \"40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks\". In addition, the sound of the hammer striking the stamp was used in the intro to the WWE entrance music of wrestler Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine.\n"}

It is made from 13 herbs and plants, predominant amongst which is the artichoke (\"Cynara scolymus\"), from which the drink derives its name. Cynar is dark brown in color, has a bittersweet flavor, and its strength is 16.5% ABV. It was launched in Italy in 1952.\n\nCynar is an apéritif (low sugar, low alcohol, meant to stimulate appetite), and can be consumed by itself, or in a number of cocktails. One such cocktail includes Cynar and soda (mixed with soda water and lemon or orange slice, or with cola, eggnog, tonic water, milk or bitter lemon soda). Europeans often mix it with orange juice, especially in Switzerland and Southern Germany, where Cynar and orange juice is a very popular combination. A variation of the Negroni cocktail uses Cynar in place of Campari. Because of its artichoke component, Cynar is regarded as a digestif as well as an apéritif.\n\nSince 1995 Cynar has been manufactured and distributed by the Campari Group.\n\nThe liquor became popular during the early 1960s thanks to its appearance on the Italian television advertising show \"Carosello\". The series of commercials, first starring Ferruccio De Ceresa, and from 1966 Ernesto Calindri, showed the actor sipping Cynar while sitting at a table placed in the middle of a busy street, urging consumers to drink Cynar \"against the strain of modern life\". Toward the end of the seventies, the commercial changed settings and moved from the busy city to a field of artichokes. The partnership between Calindri and the brand lasted until 1984. \n\n"}

Owned and operated by Cumulus Media, WDVD's studios and offices are located in the Fisher Building in Detroit's New Center district near downtown, while its transmitter is located in Oakland County in Royal Oak Township at 8 Mile Road and Wyoming Avenue.\n\nWDVD broadcasts with an effective radiated power of 20,000 watts from an antenna that is 787 feet in height, and transmits its signal from the same tower from which five other Detroit FM radio stations broadcast. WDVD is licensed for HD Radio operations.\n\nOn June 1, 1948, the station signed on as WJR-FM, simulcasting WJR (760 AM), Detroit's CBS Radio Network affiliate. In 1966 WJR-FM separated programming from WJR (AM) and began airing \"The Young Sound,\" a beautiful music format featuring instrumental covers of contemporary hits which was used on many CBS-affiliated FM stations. In 1969, the station adopted the \"Solid Gold Rock and Roll\" automated format from Drake-Chenault, a mix of soft rock, current Easy Listening (adult contemporary) chart hits, and rock and roll oldies, and began to brand itself as \"California Radio.\" After almost three years, the station reverted to beautiful music, with which it was quite successful for a time. Competitors at this time were WLDM-FM (now WKQI), WWJ-FM (now WXYT-FM), and WKNR-FM (later WNIC-FM).\n\nIn June 1982, \"Billboard Magazine\" reported that WJR-FM's owner, Capital Cities Communications, had hired consultant Mike Joseph to implement his widely successful \"Hot Hits\" format on WJR-FM by the fall of that year, taking note of the success the format was having in Philadelphia (WCAU-FM) and in Chicago (WBBM-FM). In July 1982, WJR-FM applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a call letter change to WHYT. The call letter change was approved on August 16, 1982.\n\nOn September 15, 1982, at 5 p.m., WHYT converted to a new format after one last spin of \"Fly Me to the Moon\" by Frank Sinatra, followed by the first song of the new format, \"You Dropped a Bomb on Me\" by The Gap Band. \"Hot Hits\" was a fast-moving, jingle-intensive format that featured a tight rotation of 50 current hits (no recurrent hits or oldies, unless they happened to be featured on currently charting albums).\n\nThe station used the on-air names \"\"96 Now\"\" (the same slogan used by WBBM-FM, which still operates on the same frequency in Chicago to this day) and \"96 WHYT\". The \"Hot Hits\" format in Detroit was a moderate ratings success, but did not approach the popularity that WCAU or WBBM-FM were enjoying with Hot Hits, probably due in part to heavy competition from Detroit's urban contemporary and album oriented rock stations. In response, WHYT's CHR format went through several metamorphoses in the next few years, dropping the Mike Joseph formatics (though they continued to use the slogan \"Hot Hits\" on the air through 1986) and adopting several different on-air monikers, including \"WHYT 96 Hit FM\", and \"HitRadio 96 WHYT\". One of the noteworthy WHYT personalities during this time was Joey Reynolds, who had last worked in Detroit radio at WXYZ-AM eighteen years earlier.\n\nIn 1986, shortly after Capital Cities merged with ABC, the station retooled itself as \"Power 96\". Under programmer Rick Gillette, the station added more dance music and urban contemporary product to its CHR playlist, and listenership increased, leading the station to be a regular top 10 ratings finisher through the end of the decade. In 1989, the station rebranded as simply \"96.3 FM\", taking on even more of a rhythmic contemporary lean. For much of the 1980s, WHYT was Detroit's local affiliate for Casey Kasem's (and then Shadoe Stevens') American Top 40.\n\nWHYT's major competitors from the mid-1980s through the early 1990s were Z95.5 and 99.5 The Fox, as well as then churban powerhouse WJLB. The station's peak of popularity came during its days as both \"Power 96\" and then \"96.3 FM\" from roughly 1986 to 1991, when the station moved its music mix toward rhythmic CHR (while not totally abandoning mainstream pop and rock), frequently racked up top five Arbitron ratings 12+, and was one of the top stations in the 12-24 age demographics (often neck-and-neck with WJLB, with Z95.5 coming in a distant third despite often beating WHYT 12+). Michael J. Foxx (not to be confused with actor Michael J. Fox), Sonny Joe Harris, Bo \"The Jammer\" Jackson (not to confused with the sports star Bo Jackson), Dave Fogel and Lisa Lisa \"The Party Princess\" Orlando (not to be confused with the musical artist Lisa Lisa of Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam) Michael Waite and the Morning Zoo were all popular DJ's at WHYT. In 1991, however, the debut of 89X, as well as Foxx's departure, took substantial market share away from WHYT as teens and young adults flocked to the \"cutting edge\" modern rock format of 89X.\n\nIn 1992, the station delved even farther into rhythmic CHR territory, becoming known as \"96.3 Jamz.\" WHYT eliminated most of the mainstream pop and rock from its playlist and began to focus almost exclusively on hip-hop, R&B and dance hits as well as some dance remixes of mainstream hits.\n\nDuring Memorial Day weekend in 1994 came a formatic shift at WHYT, as the station modified its Rhythmic CHR format into a sound it tagged \"Planet Jams\", evolving into a hybrid of hip-hop and alternative rock while dropping all R&B product. This format, known in radio trades as \"Channel X\" (also implemented at KUBE in Seattle among other stations), was described by some as a radio version of MTV. Alternative bands such as Soundgarden, Nine Inch Nails, and Pearl Jam were played alongside Coolio, Snoop Dogg, and Da Brat, and the station also continued to sprinkle in some dance hits from the likes of Real McCoy, Madonna, Ace of Base, and 2 Unlimited. Within a few months, the station would drop all hip-hop and dance songs as WHYT, now known as \"The Planet 96.3\", become a more straightforward alternative station.\n\nIn reference to the format shift, program director Rick Gillette, who had guided WHYT to high ratings during its \"Power 96\" and \"96.3FM\" days in the late 1980s, claimed that the station was merely responding to the popularity of the \"hot\" music of the time, which happened to be Alternative. In addition to Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, Soundgarden, and the other popular rock bands of the day, the Planet played a number of local Detroit acts that never achieved major national stardom, such as the Suicide Machines and Charm Farm, as well as some non-mainstream dance and ambient artists such as Vanessa Daou.\n\nAfter completing a deal with a college radio station in Plattsburgh, New York, the station's calls were switched to WPLT to match the \"Planet\" moniker on June 30, 1997. (The WHYT calls are now used at a contemporary Christian music station near Lapeer, Michigan.) With the call letter change, however, the station tweaked its format to more of a Modern Adult Contemporary sound to distinguish it more from competing alternative-rock station CIMX (and, later in 1997, WXDG). The Planet dropped White Zombie, The Offspring and other harder-edged artists from its playlist and focused more on alternative pop-rock acts such as Jewel, Sheryl Crow, and Barenaked Ladies. The Planet also played Classic Alternative music heavily, with the hour-long \"Flashback Lunch\" middays at noon; \"Saturday Night Flashbacks\", with dance and extended versions of classic alternative and '80s songs, broadcast live from the nightclub Clutch Cargo's in suburban Pontiac; and holiday-weekend countdowns of \"The Coolest Flashbacks of All Time.\" During this time, the station identified itself as \"Modern Hits of the 80s and 90s\". A popular feature on WPLT was Big Sonic Heaven, a Sunday-night program of ambient, trance, chill and non-mainstream dance music hosted by DJ Darren Revell.\n\nThe Planet made some ratings headway with the Modern AC sound, but was never a major player in the market. On September 6, 1999, at 4:30 PM, after finishing their Labor Day weekend \"Flashback 500\" countdown (with \"In Your Eyes\" by Peter Gabriel being the #1 song), the station began a 3-hour stunt of a loop of \"It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\" by R.E.M.. At 7:30 PM, WPLT relaunched as \"Alternative Classics\", an attempt to convert the station's popular 1980s \"Flashback\" shows into a full-time format by combining 1980s new wave and punk with more recent (but non-current) 1990s grunge/alternative, while keeping the \"Planet\" moniker. The first song on the relaunched \"Planet\" was \"Plush\" by Stone Temple Pilots. Core artists of \"Alternative Classics\" included U2, Depeche Mode, The Cure, The Go-Go's, Peter Gabriel, Erasure, and Echo & the Bunnymen. The change failed to raise ratings, and within a year, WPLT had begun to re-add current music into its rotation (such as \"Smooth\" by Santana and Rob Thomas) under the guise of \"Future Alternative Classics\".\n\nIn response to continued low ratings, the station dropped its \"Planet\" moniker in early 2001, changed its calls to WDVD on March 14, and gradually shifted its playlist towards a more mainstream Hot AC direction, though still heavy on alternative rock. The shift was completed on June 29, when the station adopted the new \"96.3 DVD\" moniker and the \"Today's Best Variety\" slogan. The \"Flashback\" programs and \"Big Sonic Heaven\" were cancelled shortly afterward. (The WPLT calls have since been picked up by a country station in Spooner, Wisconsin.)\n\nAfter the transition to Hot AC and the WDVD calls, the station continued to feature a heavy alternative-rock base for several years, while playing \"hair bands\" such as Poison and Aerosmith and pop artists like Kelly Clarkson and Christina Aguilera, and remained in the lower echelons of the Detroit ratings. By 2006, however, this began to change as WDVD freshened its presentation and began to evolve into more of an Adult Top 40 station, dropping most 1980s titles from its playlist, adding jingles, and branded itself with the new slogan \"Today's Best Hits Without the Rap\" (and taking shots at longtime rival station WKQI for playing too much hip hop). Generally, though, as per its slogan, the station avoids hip hop music except for those who cross over to the Hot AC charts. Songs by Hot AC artists with hip-hop guest stars, such as \"California Gurls\" by Katy Perry and Snoop Dogg, typically have the rap breaks edited out. \nIn February 2006, WDVD, along with its sister stations, WJR and WDRQ, were included in the sale of ABC Radio to Citadel Broadcasting. The sale was completed on June 12, 2007. According to the Citadel page, Citadel considered WDVD an adult-leaning Top 40 station without rap. After several years in the ratings doldrums, the station subsequently saw its share of the Detroit market increase, as they added more pop music from artists such as Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez, and Britney Spears to their playlist to compete with both Channel 9-5-5 and 98-7 Amp Radio while rotations of 1980s and 1990s titles were decreased. By June 2012, the station had moved even closer to Adult Top 40 by adding pop-friendly hip-hop artists such as Nicki Minaj, LMFAO, and Flo Rida into rotation.\n\nIn late 2014, the station tweaked its playlist again, removing many of the more rhythmic-oriented tracks from rotation and re-adding many 1980s and 1990s hits. As a result, Cumulus moved WDVD from Mediabase's Hot AC panel to the Mainstream AC panel, giving Detroit two Mainstream AC reporter stations (along with WNIC), although the station remained closer to Hot AC musically. The station has since returned to the Hot AC panel but continues to play more 1980s music than is the norm for contemporary Hot AC. In addition, the station's slogan of \"Today's Best Hits\" has changed as of May 2017 to \"Today's Best Music.\"\n\nThe station's morning show hosts, Allyson Martinek and Blaine Fowler, were featured on the syndicated television program \"Dish Nation\" until November 2012.\n\nOn July 28, 2015, Allyson Martinek was let go from the station, with Blaine Fowler remaining in mornings. Martinek then later joined WNIC in November 2016, exactly one year and four months after she was let go from the station.\n\nIn addition to its CHR competition, beginning in August 2011, WDVD gained a direct competitor in the Hot AC format as longtime Mainstream AC station WNIC, rebranded as Fresh 100.3, moved to a Hot AC playlist. WNIC returned to its previous AC format a little over a year later and has also since dropped the \"Fresh\" name. On the Canadian side of the border, WDVD also directly competes with CHYR-FM for listeners in Windsor and Essex County, Ontario.\n\nIn 2007, WDVD revived \"Planet 96.3\" and the \"Alternative Classics\" format as an offering on its secondary HD Radio channel. This was dropped and replaced by \"Top 20 New Hits\", a format focusing on new Adult CHR releases not yet played on the main station. In August 2012, WDVD revived the \"Planet 96.3\" name and Modern AC/Classic Alternative format, playing classic alternative songs from the '70s, '80s and '90s, songs that were played on the original Planet 96.3 as currents in the late 1990s, and a few more recent titles.\n\nIn the spring of 2015, WDVD HD2 flipped formats again, this time to a simulcast of news/talk sister station WJR.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2097128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097128", "title": "Anti-art", "text": "Anti-art\n\nAnti-art is a loosely used term applied to an array of concepts and attitudes that reject prior definitions of art and question art in general. Somewhat paradoxically, anti-art tends to conduct this questioning and rejection from the vantage point of art. The term is associated with the Dada movement and is generally accepted as attributable to Marcel Duchamp pre-World War I around 1914, when he began to use found objects as art. It was used to describe revolutionary forms of art. The term was used later by the Conceptual artists of the 1960s to describe the work of those who claimed to have retired altogether from the practice of art, from the production of works which could be sold.\n\nAn expression of anti-art may or may not take traditional form or meet the criteria for being defined as a work of art according to conventional standards. Indeed, works of anti-art may express an outright rejection of having conventionally defined criteria as a means of defining what art is, and what it is not. Anti-artworks may reject conventional artistic standards altogether, or focus criticism only on certain aspects of art, such as the art market and high art. Some anti-artworks may reject individualism in art, whereas some may reject \"universality\" as an accepted factor in art. Additionally, some forms of anti-art reject art entirely, or reject the idea that art is a separate realm or specialization. Anti-artworks may also reject art based upon a consideration of art as being oppressive of a segment of the population.\n\nAnti-art artworks may articulate a disagreement with the generally supposed notion of there being a separation between art and life. Indeed, anti-art artworks may voice a question as to whether \"art\" really exists or not. \"Anti-art\" has been referred to as a \"paradoxical neologism\", in that its obvious opposition to art has been observed concurring with staples of twentieth-century art or \"modern art\", in particular art movements that have self-consciously sought to transgress traditions or institutions. Anti-art itself is not a distinct art movement, however. This would tend to be indicated by the time it spans—longer than that usually spanned by art movements. Some art movements though, are labeled \"anti-art\". The Dada movement is generally considered the first anti-art movement; the term anti-art itself is said to have been coined by Dadaist Marcel Duchamp around 1914, and his readymades have been cited as early examples of anti-art objects. Theodor W. Adorno in \"Aesthetic Theory\" (1970) stated that \"...even the abolition of art is respectful of art because it takes the truth claim of art seriously\".\n\nAnti-art has become generally accepted by the artworld to be art, although some people still reject Duchamp's readymades as art, for instance the Stuckist group of artists, who are \"anti-anti-art\".\n\nAnti-art can take the form of art or not. It is posited that anti-art need not even take the form of art, in order to embody its function as anti-art. This point is disputed. Some of the forms of anti-art which are art strive to reveal the conventional limits of art by expanding its properties.\n\nSome instances of anti-art are suggestive of a reduction to what might seem to be fundamental elements or building blocks of art. Examples of this sort of phenomenon might include monochrome paintings, empty frames, silence as music, chance art. Anti-art is also often seen to make use of highly innovative materials and techniques, and well beyond—to include hitherto unheard of elements in visual art. These types of anti-art can be readymades, found object art, détournement, combine paintings, appropriation (art), happenings, performance art, and body art.\n\nAnti-art can involve the renouncement of making art entirely. This can be accomplished through an art strike and this can also be accomplished through revolutionary activism. An aim of anti-art can be to undermine or understate individual creativity. This may be accomplished through the utilization of readymades. Individual creativity can be further downplayed by the use of industrial processes in the making of art. \"Anti-artists\" may seek to undermine individual creativity by producing their artworks anonymously. They may refuse to show their artworks. They may refuse public recognition. Anti-artists may choose to work collectively, in order to place less emphasis on individual identity and individual creativity. This can be seen in the instance of happenings. This is sometimes the case with \"supertemporal\" artworks, which are by design impermanent. Anti-artists will sometimes destroy their works of art. Some artworks made by anti-artists are purposely created to be destroyed. This can be seen in auto-destructive art.\n\nAndré Malraux has developed a concept of anti-art quite different from that outlined above. For Malraux, anti-art began with the 'Salon' or 'Academic' art of the nineteenth century which rejected the basic ambition of art in favour of a semi-photographic illusionism (often prettified). Of Academic painting, Malraux writes, 'All true painters, all those for whom painting is a value, were nauseated by these pictures – \"Portrait of a Great Surgeon Operating\" and the like – because they saw in them not a form of painting, but the negation of painting'. For Malraux, anti-art is still very much with us, though in a different form. Its descendants are commercial cinema and television, and popular music and fiction. The 'Salon', Malraux writes, 'has been expelled from painting, but elsewhere it reigns supreme'.\n\nAnti-art is also a tendency in the theoretical understanding of art and fine art.\n\nThe philosopher Roger Taylor puts forward that art is a bourgeois ideology that has its origins with capitalism in \"Art, an Enemy of the People\". Holding a strong anti-essentialist position he states also that art has not always existed and is not universal but peculiar to Europe, a claim that is factually inaccurate as proven by many substantial archaeological findings on the Asian and African continents.\n\n\"\" by Larry Shiner is an art history book which fundamentally questions our understanding of art.\n\"The modern system of art is not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old.\" (Shiner 2003, p. 3)\nShiner presents (fine) art as a social construction that has not always existed throughout human history and could also disappear in its turn.\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau rejected the separation between performer and spectator, life and theatre. Karl Marx posited that art was a consequence of the class system and therefore concluded that, in a communist society, there would only be people who engage in the making of art and no \"artists\".\n\nArguably the first movement that deliberately set itself in opposition to established art were the Incoherents in late 19th. century Paris. Founded by Jules Lévy in 1882, the Incoherents organized charitable art exhibitions intended to be satirical and humoristic, they presented \"...drawings by people who can't draw...\" and held masked balls with artistic themes, all in the greater tradition of Montmartre cabaret culture. While short lived – the last Incoherent show took place in 1896 – the movement was popular for its entertainment value. In their commitment to satire, irreverence and ridicule they produced a number of works that show remarkable formal similarities to creations of the avant-garde of the 20th century: ready-mades, monochromes, empty frames and silence as music.\n\nBeginning in Switzerland, during World War I, much of Dada, and some aspects of the art movements it inspired, such as Neo-Dada, Nouveau réalisme, and Fluxus, is considered anti-art. Dadaists rejected cultural and intellectual conformity in art and more broadly in society. For everything that art stood for, Dada was to represent the opposite.\n\nWhere art was concerned with traditional aesthetics, Dada ignored aesthetics completely. If art was to appeal to sensibilities, Dada was intended to offend. Through their rejection of traditional culture and aesthetics the Dadaists hoped to destroy traditional culture and aesthetics. Because they were more politicized, the Berlin dadas were the most radically anti-art within Dada. In 1919, in the Berlin group, the Dadaist revolutionary central council outlined the Dadaist ideals of radical communism.\n\nBeginning in 1913 Marcel Duchamp's readymades challenged individual creativity and redefined art as a nominal rather than an intrinsic object.\n\nTristan Tzara indicated: \"I am against systems; the most acceptable system is on principle to have none.\" In addition, Tzara, who once stated that \"logic is always false\", probably approved of Walter Serner's vision of a \"final dissolution\". A core concept in Tzara's thought was that \"as long as we do things the way we think we once did them we will be unable to achieve any kind of livable society.\"\n\nOriginating in Russia in 1919, constructivism rejected art in its entirety and as a specific activity creating a universal aesthetic in favour of practices directed towards social purposes, \"useful\" to everyday life, such as graphic design, advertising and photography. In 1921, exhibiting at the 5x5=25 exhibition, Alexander Rodchenko created monochromes and proclaimed the end of painting. For artists of the Russian Revolution, Rodchenko's radical action was full of utopian possibility. It marked the end of art along with the end of bourgeois norms and practices. It cleared the way for the beginning of a new Russian life, a new mode of production, a new culture.\n\nBeginning in the early 1920s, many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost, with the works being an artifact. Surrealism as a political force developed unevenly around the world, in some places more emphasis being put on artistic practices, while in others political practises outweighed. In other places still, Surrealist praxis looked to overshadow both the arts and politics. Politically, Surrealism was ultra-leftist, communist, or anarchist. The split from Dada has been characterised as a split between anarchists and communists, with the Surrealists as communist. In 1925, the Bureau of Surrealist Research declared their affinity for revolutionary politics. By the 1930s many Surrealists had strongly identified themselves with communism. Breton and his comrades supported Leon Trotsky and his International Left Opposition for a while, though there was an openness to anarchism that manifested more fully after World War II.\n\nLeader André Breton was explicit in his assertion that Surrealism was above all a revolutionary movement. Breton believed the tenets of Surrealism could be applied in any circumstance of life, and is not merely restricted to the artistic realm. Breton's followers, along with the Communist Party, were working for the \"liberation of man.\" However, Breton's group refused to prioritize the proletarian struggle over radical creation such that their struggles with the Party made the late 1920s a turbulent time for both. Many individuals closely associated with Breton, notably Louis Aragon, left his group to work more closely with the Communists. In 1929, Breton asked Surrealists to assess their \"degree of moral competence\", and theoretical refinements included in the second \"manifeste du surréalisme\" excluded anyone reluctant to commit to collective action\n\nBy the end of World War II the surrealist group led by André Breton decided to explicitly embrace anarchism. In 1952 Breton wrote \"It was in the black mirror of anarchism that surrealism first recognised itself.\"\n\nFounded in the mid-1940s in France by Isidore Isou, the Letterists utilised material appropriated from other films, a technique which would subsequently be developed (under the title of 'détournement') in Situationist films. They would also often supplement the film with live performance, or, through the 'film-debate', directly involve the audience itself in the total experience. The most radical of the Letterist films, Wolman's \"The Anticoncept\" and Debord's \"Howls for Sade\" abandoned images altogether.\n\nIn 1956, recalling the infinitesimals of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually, the founder of Lettrism, Isidore Isou, developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually. Related to this, and arising out of it, is excoördism, the current incarnation of the Isouian movement, defined as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.\n\nIn 1960, Isidore Isou created supertemporal art: a device for inviting and enabling an audience to participate in the creation of a work of art. In its simplest form, this might involve nothing more than the inclusion of several blank pages in a book, for the reader to add his or her own contributions.\n\nIn Japan in the late 1950s, Group Kyushu was an edgy, experimental and rambunctious art group. They ripped and burned canvasses, stapled corrugated cardboard, nails, nuts, springs, metal drill shavings, and burlap to their works, assembled all kinds of unwieldy junk assemblages, and were best known for covering much of their work in tar. They also occasionally covered their work in urine and excrement. They tried to bring art closer to everyday life, by incorporating objects from daily life into their work, and also by exhibiting and performing their work outside on the street for everyone to see.\n\nOther similar anti-art groups included Neo-Dada (Neo-Dadaizumu Oganaizazu), Gutai (Gutai Bijutsu Kyokai), and Hi-Red-Center. Influenced in various ways by L'Art Informel, these groups and their members worked to foreground material in their work: rather than seeing the art work as representing some remote referent, the material itself and the artists' interaction with it became the main point. The freeing up of gesture was another legacy of L'Art Informel, and the members of Group Kyushu took to it with great verve, throwing, dripping, and breaking material, sometimes destroying the work in the process.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s in France, the Letterist International and after the Situationist International developed a dialectical viewpoint, seeing their task as \"superseding\" art, abolishing the notion of art as a separate, specialized activity and transforming it so it became part of the fabric of everyday life. From the Situationist's viewpoint, art is revolutionary or it is nothing. In this way, the Situationists saw their efforts as completing the work of both Dada and surrealism while abolishing both.\nThe situationists renounced the making of art entirely.\n\nThe members of the Situationist International liked to think they were probably the most radical, politicized, well organized, and theoretically productive anti-art movement, reaching their apex with the student protests and general strike of May 1968 in France, a view endorsed by others including the academic Martin Puchner.\n\nIn 1959 Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio proposed Industrial Painting as an \"industrial-inflationist art\"\n\nSimilar to Dada, in the 1960s, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an anti-art sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. Fluxus artists used their minimal performances to blur the distinction between life and art.\n\nIn 1962 Henry Flynt began to campaign for an anti-art position. Flynt wanted avant-garde art to become superseded by the terms of \"veramusement\" and \"brend\" – neologisms meaning approximately pure recreation.\n\nIn 1963 George Maciunas advocated revolution, \"living art, anti-art\" and \"non art reality to be grasped by all peoples\". Maciunas strived to uphold his stated aims of demonstrating the artist's 'non-professional status...his dispensability and inclusiveness' and that 'anything can be art and anyone can do it.'\n\nIn the 1960s, the Dada-influenced art group Black Mask declared that revolutionary art should be \"an integral part of life, as in primitive society, and not an appendage to wealth\". Black Mask disrupted cultural events in New York by giving made up flyers of art events to the homeless with the lure of free drinks. Later, the Motherfuckers were to grow out of a combination of Black Mask and another group called Angry Arts.\n\nThe BBC aired an interview with Duchamp conducted by Joan Bakewell in 1966 which expressed some of Duchamps more explicit Anti-Art ideas.\nDuchamp compared art with religion, whereby he stated that he wished to do away with art the same way many have done away with religion. Duchamp goes on to explain to the interviewer that \"the word art etymologically means to do\", that art means activity of any kind, and that it is our society that creates \"purely artificial\" distinctions of being an artist.\n\nDuring the 1970s, King Mob was responsible for various attacks on art galleries. According to the philosopher Roger Taylor the concept of art is not universal but is an invention of bourgeois ideology helping to promote this social order. He compares it to a cancer that colonises other forms of life so that it becomes difficult to distinguish one from the other.\n\nStewart Home called for an Art Strike between 1990 and 1993. Unlike earlier art-strike proposals such as that of Gustav Metzger in the 1970s, it was not intended as an opportunity for artists to seize control of the means of distributing their own work, but rather as an exercise in propaganda and psychic warfare aimed at smashing the entire art world rather than just the gallery system. As Black Mask had done in the 1960s, Stewart Home disrupted cultural events in London in the 1990s by giving made up flyers of literary events to the homeless with the lure of free drinks.\n\nThe K Foundation was an art foundation that published a series of Situationist-inspired press adverts and extravagant subversions in the art world. Most notoriously, when their plans to use banknotes as part of a work of art fell through, they burnt a million pounds in cash.\n\nPunk has developed anti-art positions. Some \"industrial music\" bands describe their work as a form of \"cultural terrorism\" or as a form of \"anti-art\". The term is also used to describe other intentionally provocative art forms, such as nonsense verse.\n\nParadoxically, most forms of anti-art have gradually been completely accepted by the art establishment as normal and conventional forms of art. Even the movements which rejected art with the most virulence are now collected by the most prestigious cultural institutions.\n\nDuchamp's readymades are still regarded as anti-art by the Stuckists, who also say that anti-art has become conformist, and describe themselves as anti-anti-art.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2097140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097140", "title": "Consulier GTP", "text": "Consulier GTP\n\nThe Consulier GTP is an American sports car that was produced by Consulier Industries between 1985 and 1993 and successfully used in professional racing. Consulier Industries spun off their automotive division into Mosler Automotive which then rebranded the car as the Mosler Intruder and Mosler Raptor before production ended in 2000. Mosler replaced the car with the Mosler MT900 in 2001.\n\nThe Consulier GTP, conceived by Warren Mosler in 1985, was a 2200 lb (998 kg) mid-engined sports car built in two series. The first series sold about 70 copies and was powered by a \"Chrysler 2.2 I4 Turbo II\" engine producing 175 hp (130 kW). The second series made use of the improved Turbo III version of the same engine, which produced 190 hp (141 kW) and had a top speed of 155 mph (249 km/h). Most mechanical components were also sourced from Chrysler. The chassis was a unique fiberglass-and-foam monocoque, the first carbon fiber and Kevlar-bodied vehicle ever to go into production with no structural metal in the body. The GTP Sport was the base model, with the GTP LX adding luxury features such as Recaro seats, VDO instrumentation, Fittipaldi wheels, Alpine sound system, sunroof, leather upholstery, air conditioning, cruise control, power locks, power mirrors, power windows, tilt steering wheel, and wool carpet; options included a security system and car phone. Both versions had full instrumentation, in a plain flat-black panel, with eleven gauges in two sizes.\n\nThe GTP was successful in IMSA racing for six years, however its excellent power to weight ratio, responsible for its success, effectively made the car unbeatable; the car was eventually saddled by IMSA with a 300-pound weight penalty before being banned entirely in 1991.\n\nSomewhere between 60 and 100 Consulier GTPs were built. After Consulier Industries spun off into Mosler Automotive, a few of the cars were produced as hybrids between the GTP, Intruder, and Raptor. Some were modified to accept longitudinal Chevrolet small-block V8 engines, which would eventually be used in the Intruder and Raptor. Two separate companies also modified the GTP and installed electric drive components; one of these, a company named Solar Electric, advertised their version in print ads featuring Leslie Nielsen and sold the vehicles through Neiman Marcus.\n\nIn 1993, Consulier Industries spun off their automotive division into Mosler Automotive, which focused on high-performance cars. Mosler introduced the Intruder, an updated GTP with a new 300 hp (224 kW) Corvette \"LT1\" V8 engine modified by Lingenfelter. This car raced at the Longest Day of Nelson 24-hour race in 1993 and 1994, winning both years; like the GTP before it the Intruder was also banned from Nelson Ledges after its dominating 1993–1994 performances. In 1996, a 450 hp (336 kW) Lingenfelter Intruder won \"Car and Driver\" magazine's One Lap of America.\n\nOf the four Intruders built, just one was sold. Another was converted into a GT1 racing car, while the remaining pair were converted into Raptors.\n\nIn 1997, the Intruder was renamed Raptor after being updated with a V-shaped split windshield that reduced drag. \n\nThis slightly modified car (which had previously won the 1996 One Lap event) went on to win the same event in 1997 and 1999, after which Car and Driver editor Brock Yates banned it from competing again. This car was also tested by \"Car and Driver\" in 1998. In their tests, the car weighed 2773 lb (1258 kg) and featured 446 hp (333 kW) at 5800 rpm and 429 ft·lbf (582 N·m) at 5000 rpm. The \"Small-Block\" V8 was again modified by Lingenfelter, and the five-speed transaxle came from a Porsche 911 Turbo. \n\nThe mechanical components were still sourced mainly from Chrysler as they had been since 1985: for example, the steering wheel came from a Chrysler minivan. The new split windshield caused visibility problems and blocked some of the air vents. The tested performance of the car included a 3.9 second run to 60 mph (97 km/h) and a 12.3 second and 115 mph (185 km/h) sprint through the quarter mile. Top speed was 163 mph (262 km/h), limited by drag.\n\nWarren Mosler was so confident in the performance of the GTP that he offered a $25,000 bounty to anyone who could pilot a street-legal production car around any U.S. racetrack faster than his car. \"Car and Driver\" took up the challenge, racing a 1988 Consulier GTP Series I Sport against a stock 1991 Chevrolet Corvette around the Chrysler proving grounds test track in Chelsea, Michigan. Arthur St. Antoine and Csaba Csere took three laps each in the Corvette and the GTP. They were able to obtain a best lap of 1:21.01 in the Corvette versus the GTP's best of 1:22.56. Reviewer St. Antoine opined that the GTP was \"difficult to handle\" with \"anemic brakes\".\n\nWhen \"Car and Driver\" confronted Mosler with these results prior to publication, Mosler noted that the test car was three-years-old and worn out due to heavy use: the GTP obtained by Car and Driver was borrowed from a Track Time driver's school: it had worn tires and brake pads, no interior trim, and three cigarette lighters which were specially installed so Track Time could plug in their computer and portable radio equipment. Mosler offered to rerun the test using his company test driver and after installing new brake pads in the GTP, and agreed to pay the $25,000 if the GTP still didn't lap faster than the Corvette. \"Car and Driver\" refused, saying it might be faster because of the new driver. Mosler responded that they could use any driver they wanted for their car, but to have them drive the GTP and get paid if it lost was a conflict of interest. \"Car and Driver\" subsequently published the Consulier GTP road test article in a negative and sarcastic light, where they ridiculed the borrowed car's lack of interior fit and finish and the three lighter plugs (failing to mention these were modifications made by the driving school), and compared the overall fit and finish negatively with a new Nissan 300ZX. They also claimed that Mosler defaulted on his promise. Supporting Mosler's position that the GTP should have won was the 1991 auto race in Lime Rock Park, with a Series II Consulier GTP. This car defeated Hurley Haywood's factory Porsche 911 Turbo, Boris Said's Callaway Twin Turbo Corvette, and Jim Minnaker's factory ZR1 Corvette; the race would be the GTP's last before it was banned from the IMSA series. To further back up his statements, Mosler raised the challenge to $100,000, however no production car was able to best the Series II Consulier GTP; it has been claimed that Chet Fillip bested the GTP, however he was in a modified RUF Porsche GT1 with racing slicks during his run at the Sebring International Raceway.\n"}

Magnetic compasses are also susceptible to disruption from magnetic fields other than the Earth's, such as those produced by the hulls of some metal vehicles or craft. Before the advent of electronic navigational aids such as GPS the most reliable way to ascertain north in such circumstances was through the use of an astrocompass.\n\nThe Earth's axis of rotation remains, for all intents and purposes, stationary throughout the year. Thus, with knowledge of the current time and geographical position in the form of latitude and longitude, which are set on the instrument using dials, an astrocompass can be sighted on to any astronomical object with a known position to give an extremely accurate reading.\n\nIn its most basic form, the astrocompass consists of a base plate marked with the points of the compass, with a mechanism known as an equatorial drum mounted on it. On this drum is a set of adjustable sights and a scale of declination. More advanced versions may have built-in chronometers or default settings for bodies such as the Sun.\n\nTo use the compass, the base plate is first levelled with the horizon then pointed roughly to what the user believes to be north. The equatorial drum is then tilted in relation to this base according to the local latitude. The sights are then set using the local hour angle and the declination of whatever astronomical body is being used. Once all these settings have been made, the astrocompass is simply turned until the astronomical body is visible in the sights: it will then be precisely aligned to the points of the compass. Because of this procedure, an astrocompass requires its user to be in possession of a nautical almanac or similar astronomical tables, one of its chief disadvantages.\n\nAstrocompasses only became useful following the invention of the marine chronometer, without which it is almost useless for navigation. Even then, they saw only limited use, with first magnetic compasses and then gyrocompasses being preferred in almost all cases. Polar exploration was one of the fields in which the astrocompass saw the most use, for the reasons described above. They have also been used throughout history in other climes to check the accuracy of other forms of compasses. They saw use, for example, in the North African Campaign of World War 2.\n\nGPS and other similar forms of electronic navigation aids mean that the astrocompass is now functionally obsolete anywhere except for areas very close to the poles where GPS coverage is not available and there are no current electronic navigation aids.\n\nThe operation is as follows:\n\n\n"}

It can also be used to diagnose the cause of vertigo, dizziness or balance dysfunction by testing the vestibular system.\n\nThe test is performed by attaching electrodes around the nose and measuring the movements of the eye in relation to the ground electrode. The vestibular system monitors the position and movements of the head to stabilize retinal images. This information is integrated with the visual system and spinal afferents in the brain stem to produce the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). ENG provides an objective assessment of the oculomotor and vestibular systems. A newer standard for the recording is the use of infrared video systems which allow for a more detailed observation and analysis of these eye movements, called video nystagmography (VNG). A similar test is performed for testing vertigo by using the caloric reflex test, which can be induced by air or water of specific temperatures, typically ± 7 degrees Celsius from body temperature.\n\nThe standard ENG test battery consists of three parts:\n\nThe comparison of results obtained from various subtests of ENG assists in determining whether a disorder is central or peripheral. In peripheral vestibular disorders, the side of lesion can be inferred from the results of caloric stimulation and, to some degree, from positional findings.\n\nENG or VNG can be used to record nystagmus during oculomotor tests such as saccades, pursuit and gaze testing, optokinetics and also calorics (dithermal or monothermal). Abnormal oculomotor test results may indicate either systemic or central pathology as opposed to peripheral (vestibular) pathology.\n\nOptokinetics generally are used as a cross-check on abnormal responses to oculomotor tests. Both of these tests use a \"light bar\" involving a moving light (usually red) which the patient will track with the eyes.\n\nThe caloric irrigation is the only vestibular test which allows the clinician to test the vestibular organs individually; however, it only tests one of the three semicircular canals: the horizontal canal.\n\nWhile ENG is the most widely used clinical laboratory test to assess vestibular function, normal ENG test results do not necessarily mean that a patient has typical vestibular function. ENG abnormalities can be useful in the diagnosis and localization of the site of lesion; however, many abnormalities are nonlocalizing; therefore, the clinical history and otologic examination of the patient are vital in formulating a diagnosis and treatment plan for a patient presenting with dizziness or vertigo.\n\n"}

He came from a wealthy landed family, and entered the navy aged fourteen in 1777 aboard the ship of the line HMS \"Trident\". His first year at sea was somewhat blighted when that ship came under the command of a martinet captain, Anthony James Pye Molloy, under whom the ship's company grew mutinous. In 1778 Durham procured his discharge and afterwards obtained a position under his original captain, on HMS \"Edgar\". Aboard her he saw his first action during the Great Siege of Gibraltar, later gaining the attention of Admiral Richard Kempenfelt, with whom he served on HMS \"Victory\" and HMS \"Royal George\". Durham was watch officer on 29 August 1782 when, through no fault of his own, the \"Royal George\", which was heeled for repairs, suddenly and catastrophically sank at Spithead. Being on deck, Durham was able to jump overboard and swim to safety, but the Admiral and over 800 persons lost their lives.\n\nDurham then filled a lieutenant's vacancy on HMS \"Union\" in which he saw further service at the siege of Gibraltar before making a cruise to the West Indies and then another one down the African coast in HMS \"Raisonnable\" as a junior lieutenant. Durham spent the next two years living in France, becoming fluent in French. Afterwards he served in HMS Salisbury and HMS \"Barfleur\".\n\nThe emergency in 1790 brought him promotion to Commander on 2 November 1790 and command of HMS \"Daphne\". From there he moved in 1791 to HMS \"Cygnet\".\n\nOn 12 February 1793 Durham took command of the small sloop HMS \"Spitfire\". \"Spitfire\" was pierced for 14 guns but only carried ten.\n\nThe next day he captured the French privateer \"Afrique\". The capture of \"Afrique\" was the first capture of the war of a vessel flying \"La tricolore\". For this feat Lloyd's of London gave him a piece of plate worth 100 guineas, or £300, their first such award of the war.\n\nDurham received promotion to post captain on 24 June 1793 and command of the frigate HMS \"Narcissus\". From her, on 22 October, he moved to HMS \"Hind\".\n\nIn \"Hind\" he brought in a convoy of 157 merchant ships from the Mediterranean in the face of enemy opposition. This feat provoked accolades and rewards, and he took over the frigate HMS \"Anson\" in 1796. \"Anson\" was the biggest frigate in the Navy, cut down (razeed) from a ship of the line to oppose large French frigates, and in her fought numerous actions, especially at the Battle of Donegal in October 1798.\n\nOn 28 March 1799 he married Lady Charlotte Matilda Bruce, daughter of royal governess Lady Elgin and sister of the Lord Elgin of Elgin Marbles fame, and continued his service in home waters until the Peace of Amiens. Following the resumption of hostilities, Durham was given HMS \"Defiance\", which he took to join Admiral Sir Robert Calder's fleet in 1804 and participated in the battle of Cape Finisterre after which he was informally reprimanded by Calder for being \"over zealous\" in pursuit of the enemy. Following the battle Admiral Calder requested a court martial to acquit his own conduct and called Captain Durham to appear in his defence along with two other captains. Unlike his two comrades, Durham flatly refused to leave his ship which had been repaired at \n\nPortsmouth and specially requested by Lord Nelson and so was still in command at the Battle of Trafalgar a few months later. The other two captains, William Brown and William Lechmere commanding HMS \"Ajax\" and HMS \"Thunderer\" missed the battle whilst in England.\n\nAt the Battle of Trafalgar, \"Defiance\" headed straight for the Spanish flagship \"Principe de Asturias\" but was blocked by the , a captured British ship in French service. Deliberately ramming her opponent, \"Defiance\" tore off most of the French ship's bow and devastatingly raked her before fighting a long gun duel with the battered \"Aigle\" as the \"Berwick\" wallowed in her wake (she sank after the battle). The \"Defiance\" was unable to gain the upper hand against the \"Aigle\", and so a young master's mate named Jack Spratt swam between the ships and leaped on board, fighting alone against the entire French crew until support could be given from his ship. The British crew then swarmed across the Frenchman and captured her. Durham was wounded in the battle. He took his battered ship (which had suffered 17 men killed 53 wounded)back to England, in time to give evidence at Calder's court-martial, became a banner bearer at Nelson's funeral.\n\nFollowing his recovery and receipt of the usual awards for a Trafalgar captain, Durham was transferred to HMS \"Renown\" which he commanded in the English Channel and the Mediterranean until 1810 when he was made a Rear-Admiral.\n\nIn 1814 he was given command of the Leeward Islands Station and captured two enemy frigates on his way there in HMS \"Venerable\". He remained at this post until the end of the war in 1815 when the French West Indies surrendered to him. He was Knighted and created \"Knight Commander (KCB)\". Following his first wife's death in 1816 he married, in 1817, wealthy heiress Anne Isabella Henderson but this marriage was also childless. In 1819, was promoted to Vice Admiral He was on friendly terms with King George III, who was especially fond of Durham's tall tales, often remarking \"That's a Durham!\" when he heard such a tale regardless of the raconteur.\n\nIn 1830 Durham became a full admiral and conferment as a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 1 December. He was elected a Member of Parliament for Queenborough in 1830, though this was overturned on petition and he did not take his seat. He was successfully elected for Devizes in 1834. He became the naval Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth (1836–1839) and was the second president (first naval president) of the Army and Navy Club in London.\n\nHe added the names Henderson and Calderwood to his own on his second marriage and on inheriting his mother's family estate, respectively. Following his second wife's death in 1844, Durham journeyed to Rome on private business. Contracting bronchitis, he went to Naples intent on taking a ship back to Britain, but died there on 2 April 1845, his remains being returned to Largo for burial in the family vault. As his biographer Dr Hilary L. Rubinstein (who has also edited his naval papers, available to subscribers to the Navy Records Society) discovered, he had an illegitimate daughter, Ann Bower (1789/90 - 1858), but left no further descendants.\n\n\"In memory of Sir Philip Charles Henderson Calderwood Durham of Fordell, Polton and Largo, Admiral of the Red, Knight Grand Cross of Bath and of military merit in France. He was born (sic; in fact baptised) on 29 July 1763 entered the R.N at 14 and was made Post Captain in 1793, his activity, gallantry, judgement and zeal were excelled by none in his profession and his numerous captures and successes were acknowledged by many public testimonials. He became Rear Admiral in 1810 with Commander in Chief for he West Indies from 1813 till peace in 1815 and held the command at Portsmouth from 1837-1839, he represented Queensborough and Devizes in several Parliaments, but passed his later years chiefly at Fordel.

It is owned by the Cheyenne Regional Airport Board. \n\nCheyenne Regional Airport is the home of Cheyenne Air National Guard Base, the main operating base for the Wyoming Air National Guard (WyANG) and the Wyoming Army National Guard (WARNG).\n\nThe U.S. Post Office gave Cheyenne's aviation its first boost. With the introduction of airmail routes after World War I, the Cheyenne civic leaders lobbied to establish Cheyenne as a stop. Buck Heffron piloted the first air mail flight to Salt Lake City on September 9, 1920. Heffron flew a DH-4 that could barely get high enough to clear the mountains and had a maximum speed of . The pilot was one of the brave aviators who was guided by a few instruments, maps and landmarks.\n\nCheyenne's airport saw its first paying passengers in the 1920s. The first was Elizabeth Brown, a female barber. She enjoyed a ride with World War I pilot, C.A. McKenzie, in a Curtis Oriole biplane. With the step up to the DC-3 in 1937 passengers enjoyed greater comfort and safety. Soon United DC-3s were flying Cheyenne passengers to both coasts and south to Denver.\n\nThe Boeing/United Airlines Terminal Building, Hangar and Fountain, built for what would become United Airlines between 1929 and 1934, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nDuring World War II the airport was a completion and modification center for B-17s. Captain Ralph S. Johnson was a test pilot for the then United States Army Air Corps, forerunner to the United States Air Force. The tail turret on the B-17 is known as the \"Cheyenne\" turret because it was invented at Cheyenne. United Airlines maintained its Douglas DC-3s at Cheyenne; in 1946 it had 1400 employees based locally. Until 1961 the airport was the training center for United Airlines stewardesses from across the country.\n\nThe airport was visited by Charles Lindbergh, aboard the \"Spirit of St. Louis,\" and Amelia Earhart. Many historic events are chronicled on the walls of the airport restaurant. One of the airport's celebrated visitors in recent times is child aviator Jessica Dubroff, who lost her life when her small plane crashed after takeoff in terrible weather in April, 1996.\n\nBecause of its high altitude, aircraft manufacturers test their new jetliners at Cheyenne. The latest tests involved Embraer of Brazil's E-170 and E-190 aircraft as well as Boeing's 737-900 and 787 Dreamliner jets and most recently, the Boeing 737 Max 8.\n\nThe airport terminal contains plaques of the inductees into the Wyoming Aviation Hall of Fame. The 2013 inductee is Raymond A. Johnson, who lived primarily in Cheyenne after 1960.\n\nThe field covers and has two runways: 9/27, 9,270 x 150 ft (2,825 x 46 m) concrete and 13/31, 6,690 x 150 ft (2,039 x 46 m) asphalt.\n\nThe new terminal will have 3 gates and room for 1 more in the future if needed. \n\nIn the year ending September 30, 2015 the airport had 46,436 aircraft operations, average 127 per day: 44% general aviation, 49% military, 6% air taxi and <1% airline. 99 aircraft are based at this airport: 35% single-engine, 38% multi-engine, 4% jet and 22% military.\n\nGreat Lakes Airlines (operating independently and as a codeshare partner for United Airlines) flew 19-passenger Beechcraft 1900Ds to Cheyenne until March 26, 2018. \n\nAmerican Eagle, flying for American Airlines, started nonstop Embraer ERJ-145s to Dallas/Fort Worth on July 15, 2010 but ended them on April 3, 2012. \n\nOccasional charter flights (\"casino or gamblers' flights\") go to Laughlin or Wendover, Nevada. \n\nFrontier Airlines and United Airlines use Cheyenne as a diversion airport on occasion for flights to Denver International Airport. \n\nOn August 4, 2018, American Airlines announced non-stop service to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, which began on November 4, 2018. These are SkyWest Airlines flights.\n\nOn February 4, 2019, American Airlines announced a second daily non-stop service to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, which began in May 2019.\n\nUnited Airlines served Cheyenne until 1960. In 1954 United Convair 340s flew Denver - Cheyenne - Scottsbluff, NE - North Platte, NE - Grand Island, NE - Lincoln, NE - Omaha - Chicago - Detroit - Philadelphia - New York Newark Airport. By 1959 United had one roundtrip Convair 340 flight a day between Cheyenne and Denver.\n\nWestern Airlines Boeing 737-200 jet service ended in 1979; Western flew Lockheed L-188 Electras to Cheyenne in the 1960s and Douglas DC-3s and Douglas DC-6Bs in the 1950s. In 1966 Western Electras flew Los Angeles - San Diego - Phoenix - Denver - Cheyenne - Casper - Sheridan, WY - Billings and Denver - Cheyenne - Casper - Sheridan, WY - Billings - Great Falls - Calgary. In 1973 two Western 737s a day left Cheyenne, one to Denver and the other to Billings via Casper and Sheridan.\n\nThe original Frontier Airlines (1950-1986) served Cheyenne with Boeing 737-200s, Convair 580s and de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters. In 1967 Frontier Convair 580s flew direct to Dallas, Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Little Rock, Salt Lake City, and Colorado Springs and nonstop to Denver. Earlier, Frontier served Cheyenne with Convair 340s and Douglas DC-3s. In 1977 Frontier turboprops and 737s flew to Cheyenne; in 1983 its Cheyenne flights were all 737s. It dropped Cheyenne by spring 1985.\n\nSmaller regional and commuter airlines served Cheyenne with service primarily to Denver including Rocky Mountain Airways de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters and DHC-7 Dash 7s. In 1985 Rocky Mountain Airways was the only airline flying Cheyenne to Denver with up to nine round trip Twin Otters. By 1989 Rocky Mountain had become a Continental Express carrier and had up to eight Beechcraft 1900Cs a day round trip between the airport and Denver. In 1991 Mesa Airlines operating as United Express had joined Continental Express at the airport with these air carriers operating a combined total of up to thirteen departures a day to Denver with both airlines flying Beechcraft 1900Cs. By 1995, Mesa operating as United Express with Beechcraft 1900Cs was the only airline between Cheyenne and Denver. In 1999 Great Lakes Airlines had replaced Mesa as the United Express airline at Cheyenne and was the only airline at the airport with Beechcraft 1900Cs to Denver.\n\n\nCheyenne ANGB occupies approximately 77 acres of leased land on the Cheyenne Regional Airport. Within this area was once the facilities of the former United Airlines Modification Center and former stewardess training center for UAL. The host wing is the 153d Airlift Wing (153 AW) of the Wyoming Air National Guard, currently flying the C-130H Hercules theater airlift aircraft. The 153 AW is operationally-gained by the Air Mobility Command (AMC), and given its proximity to F. E. Warren AFB, was chosen as the first \"Active-Associate\" unit in the U.S. Air Force and the Air National Guard. As an Active-Associate unit, from 1 July 2006 until 1 September 2015, the 153 AW incorporated both a traditional Air National Guard C-130 airlift squadron, the 187th Airlift Squadron (187 AS), and a full-time active duty Regular Air Force C-130 airlift squadron, the 30th Airlift Squadron (30 AS). Both squadrons shared the same C-130H aircraft. With the inactivation of the 30AS, the 153 AW is once again a traditional Air National Guard unit.\n\nOn April 11, 1996, 7 year old Jessica Dubroff, along with her father and flight instructor, died when her general aviation aircraft crashed after takeoff from Cheyenne Regional in a storm. Dubroff was attempting to be the youngest person to fly across the United States.\n\n\n"}

Authority for the proposition that averaging is the appropriate approach may be taken from the case of English Hop Growers v Dering (1928).\n\nWhen damages are not predetermined/assessed in advance, then the amount recoverable is said to be 'at large' (to be agreed or determined by a court or tribunal in the event of breach).\n\nGenerally, at common law, a liquidated damages clause will not be enforced if its purpose is to punish the party in breach rather than to compensate the injured party (in which case it is referred to as a penal or penalty clause). One reason for this is that the enforcement of the term would, in effect, require an equitable order of specific performance. However, courts sitting in equity will seek to achieve a fair result and will not enforce a term that will lead to the unjust enrichment of the enforcing party.\n\nIn order for a liquidated damages clause to be upheld, two conditions must be met. \nDamages that are sufficiently uncertain may be referred to as unliquidated damages, and may be so categorized because they are not mathematically calculable or are subject to a contingency which makes the amount of damages uncertain.\n\nContracts under common law require there to have been some attempt to create an equal or reasonably proportionate quota between the damages made and the actual loss. Parties must not lose sight of the principal compensation and they must keep the time of execution and the difficulty of the calculations in mind when drafting the contract. \n\nFor example, suppose Neal Townsend agrees to lease a store-front to Richard Smith, from which Richard intends to sell jewellery. If Townsend breaches the contract by refusing to lease the store-front at the appointed time, it will be difficult to determine what profits Smith will have lost because the success of newly created small businesses is highly uncertain. This, therefore, would be an appropriate circumstance for Smith to insist upon a liquidated damages clause in case Townsend fails to perform.\n\nIn the case of construction contracts, courts have occasionally refused to enforce liquidated damages provisions, choosing to follow the doctrine of concurrent delay when both parties have contributed to the overall delay of the project.\n\nContracts in the NEC3 family use the term 'low service damages' (optional clause X.17) and generally include a Low Service Damages Schedule.\n\nIn Australia, the definition of liquidated damages applies to the situations where upon the failure of a primary stipulation, imposes a detriment to the first party or a benefit to the second party by a secondary stipulation collateral to the primary stipulation (i.e. it does not have to be a breach).\n\nIn the United States, Section 2-718(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code provides that, in contracts for the sale of goods:\n\nThis largely mirrors the common law rule, which applies to other types of contracts under the law of most US states.\n\nUK bank and credit card customers were being charged as much as £39 for a single transaction taking them over their credit limit. Consumers argued these charges were well beyond the cost of sending a computerised letter.\n\nIn 2007 the Office of Fair Trading investigated the charges being imposed on customers of credit card companies. In its report, the OFT claimed these charges were unlawful under UK law as they amounted to a penalty. It said it would be prepared to investigate any charge over £12, though this was not intended to indicate that £12 is a fair and acceptable charge. The OFT said it would be up to a court to determine such an amount based on the established legal precedent that the only recoverable cost would be actual costs incurred.\n\nThe credit card companies did not produce evidence of their actual costs to the OFT, instead insisting their charges are in line with clear policy and information provided to customers.\n\nReceipt of liquidated damages and intimately linked with the purpose of the profit-making apparatus, is a capital receipt. The amount received by the assessee towards compensation for sterilization of the profit earning source is not in the ordinary course of business. Hence, it is a capital receipt in the hands of the assessee.\n\nIn 2009 the Supreme Court ruled (\"see Office of Fair Trading v Abbey National plc\") that terms in bank account contracts were not capable of being penal, bar those applicable to NatWest Bank customers between 2001 and 2003. The court ruled that the charges were a charge for a service, and not a penalty for damages for breaching a contract term.\n\nIn 2012, the High Court of Australia allowed an appeal against findings of the Federal Court of Australia that 'exception fees' imposed by the ANZ Bank could not constitute an unenforceable penalty. The High Court found that fees were not incapable of being characterised as penalties merely because they were not charged upon breach of contract.\n\nConversely, in 2014, the federal court (Gordon J) described $35 late payment fees by ANZ Banking Group to customers who failed to make their monthly minimum credit card repayment as being “extravagant, exorbitant and unconscionable” and ordered for these fees to be reimbursed. ANZ appealed.\n\nIn 2015, the full court overturned Justice Gordon’s first instance judgment that credit card late payment fees charged by ANZ to its customers constituted penalties at law and equity (and were therefore largely unenforceable). The decision otherwise upholds Justice Gordon's findings that honour, dishonour and overlimit fees charged by ANZ were not penalties, unconscionable or unfair. While the decision is very fact specific, it represented a major setback for other class actions based on penalties. Paciocco appealed to the High Court.\n\nThe last chapter of the bank fees saga took place in July 2016 where the High Court dismissed the appeal for leave and held that the full court was correct to characterise the loss provision costs, regulatory capital costs and collection costs as affecting the legitimate interests of the Bank. The Court asserted that the fact that those categories of costs could not be recovered in an action for damages did not alter that conclusion. Further, neither the fact that the late payment fees were not genuine pre-estimates of damage nor the fact that the amounts charged were disproportionate to the actual loss suffered by itself rendered the late payment fees penalties. High Court\n\nCivil law systems generally impose less severe restrictions on liquidated damages. For example, Article 1226 of the French Civil Code provides for \"clause pénale\", a variant of liquidated damages which combines compensatory and coercive elements. Judges may adjust excessive contract penalties, but such clauses are not generally void as a matter of French law.\n\nArticle 420-1 of the Civil Code of Japan provides an even firmer basis to uphold contractual penalties:\n\n\nIn the U.S. state of Louisiana, which follows a civil law system, liquidated damages are referred to as \"stipulated damages\". Prior to 1 January 1985, Louisiana law used the term “penal clause” under former article 2117 of the Civil Code. Stipulated damages create a secondary obligation for the purpose of enforcing the principal obligation. The aggrieved party may demand either the stipulated damages or performance of the principal obligation, but may not demand both except for delay. Stipulated damages may not be modified by the court (and will therefore be enforced) \"unless they are so manifestly unreasonable as to be contrary to public policy\".\n\nIslamic law prohibits \"gharar\" (uncertainty) in contracts, and liquidated damages provisions are a favored mechanism to overcome uncertainty regarding contractual damages.\n\n"}

Along the southern portion of the river towards its mouth, it forms the international boundary between Togo and Benin. The river drains into the Bight of Benin through an extensive system of brackish water lagoons and lakes, including Lake Togo. Only the part of the river nearest its mouth is navigable. Most of the river's basin on the upper tableland is cultivated for maize, yams, rice, cotton and cassava.\n\nThe river is dammed from its mouth by the Nangbeto Dam, a partnership between Benin and Togo completed in 1987. Studies have reported economic benefits from the dam, including tourism and fishing in the lake behind it. The dam's construction displaced between 7,600 and 10,000 people, however, and studies indicate that it has substantially modified the ecology of the lagoon system at the river's mouth by reducing the natural seasonal fluctuations in river flow. A second dam project, Adjarala Dam, was proposed to be built on the river between Nangbeto and the river's mouth during the 1990s but did not receive financing until 2017 when the China-Africa Development Fund agreed to support the project. The dam's construction is part of the government's plan to increase Benin's domestic power generation capacity from 20 to 70% as most of Togo and Benin's electricity currently needs to be imported from the Akosombo Dam in Ghana.\n\nAbout from its mouth, there are six series of rapids. Below this, the river becomes slow-moving and flows over a swampy floodplain, and there is a large area of contiguous wetland in both Togo and Benin. This area has a rich growth of reeds, sedges and grasses, and manatees, crocodiles and hippopotamus occur in the river.\n\n"}

It is believed that Grates Cove was visited by seasonal fisherman before this and some have expressed the belief that it was visited as early as 1497 by John Cabot. This speculation has been fueled by the presence of a large rock high above the water on a cliff face located in Grates Cove.

{"id": "2097252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097252", "title": "76ers–Celtics rivalry", "text": "76ers–Celtics rivalry\n\nThe 76ers–Celtics rivalry is a National Basketball Association (NBA) rivalry between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Boston Celtics. The two teams have the most meetings in the NBA playoffs, playing each other in 21 series, with the Celtics winning 13 of them. The 76ers are considered to be the Celtics' second greatest rival, after the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThe Syracuse Nationals and Boston Celtics played in the Eastern Division in the 1950s. The Nationals beat the Celtics in three straight playoff series in 1954, 1955, and 1956, winning the NBA Championship in 1955. After the 1956 season the Celtics traded for Bill Russell and drafted K.C. Jones, both of whom starred and won Championships at the University of San Francisco. Also adding Tom Heinsohn with a territorial pick, the Celtics would win their next three playoff series against the Nationals in the playoffs (1957, 1959, and 1961) before the Nationals were sold and moved to Philadelphia.\n\nIn 1963, the Syracuse Nationals moved to Philadelphia and became the 76ers, renewing the basketball rivalry between Philadelphia and Boston (from when the Warriors had been in Philadelphia). Shortly after the All-Star break in 1965, the Sixers acquired Wilt Chamberlain from the Warriors, bringing the Chamberlain/Russell matchup back into the rivalry as well.\n\nThe Celtics and Sixers met in the Eastern Conference Finals that season with a trip to the NBA Finals on the line. The series went the distance, with Game 7 being held at the Boston Garden. With 5 seconds left and Boston leading 110-109, Russell tried to inbound the ball when it hit a guy wire that supported the backboard, which resulted in a turnover. However, the Sixers failed to capitalize when Celtics forward John Havlicek deflected the inbound pass to Sam Jones, who ran out the clock. The Celtics advanced to the NBA Finals and defeated the Los Angeles Lakers in five games for their seventh straight title.\n\nIn the 1966 season, the Sixers looked poised to end Boston's 7-year reign as NBA Champions; Philadelphia won the regular season series against Boston 6-4 and finished 55-25 to beat out the Celtics by one game and win the number one seed in Eastern Division. Chamberlain also won the MVP over Russell, who had won three of the previous four awards. When they met in the Conference Championship however, Boston defeated Philadelphia 4-1 and went on to win their eighth straight NBA Championship.\n\nThe next year the Sixers brought in Alex Hannum as head coach. Hannum had also coached the Bob Pettit-led St. Louis Hawks to the 1958 NBA Championship-the last year someone had defeated the Celtics in the championship. The Sixers went a then-NBA record 68-13 while the Celtics were 60-21. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Sixers overpowered Boston, beating them in five games and ending Boston's eight-year reign as NBA champions. The Sixers won the NBA Championship by beating the San Francisco Warriors in six games, giving the Sixers and Chamberlain their first title. The 1966-67 76ers were voted in 1980 as being the greatest team in the History of the NBA to that point. \n\nIn 1968, the Sixers finished 62-20, eight games above Boston, and Chamberlain won his third consecutive MVP award. Both teams met in the Conference Championship again, and the Celtics won the Series in seven games after trailing 3-1, and went on to win the 1968 NBA Championship. After the season, 76ers head coach Alex Hannum left the NBA for the ABA in order to move closer to his family on the West Coast, and Chamberlain requested a trade, and was traded to Los Angeles.\n\nWithout Wilt, the Sixers managed a 55-27 record. Though Philadelphia again won the regular season series against the Celtics, they were no match for Boston in the playoffs and lost 4-1. The Celtics went on to win the championship, their 11th in 13 seasons. After this season, Russell retired and both teams would not meet in the playoffs until 1977. Ironically, the only two years Russell's Celtics did not win the championship, they lost to teams coached by Alex Hannum.\n\nThe Sixers slumped until acquiring Julius Erving before the 1977 season. They became a contender in the East, and in Erving's first season with the team, the Sixers eliminated the defending champion Boston Celtics in a tough seven-game Eastern semifinals in 1977. Boston slumped for the next two seasons while Philadelphia continued to be a strong team in the NBA, but in 1978, the Celtics drafted Indiana State forward Larry Bird in the hope of reviving their glory years as a franchise. Bird eventually joined the team for the 1980 season and his impact was immediate, as the Celtics improved from a 29-53 record in the 1978-79 season to a league best 61-21 record in 1979-1980, advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals that season to face the Sixers. The Sixers beat Boston in 5, but failed to win the title against the Lakers.\n\nThe next season, both the Celtics and the Sixers finished with the best record in the NBA at 62-20, but Boston held the tiebreaker in the ranking. In a classic 7-game Eastern Finals, the Celtics beat the 76ers in 1981 4-3, coming all the way back from a 3-1 deficit to win the next 3 games in classic finishes. The Celtics won Games 5 and 6 by 2 points each and the seventh game by 1 point, 91-90, coming back from a 7-point deficit with a few minutes left to win on a Larry Bird banker from the left side with barely a minute left. The Celtics then defeated the Houston Rockets on their way to their first title in 5 years. For the 1981-1982 season, the Celtics again had the best record in the NBA at 63-19, followed by Philadelphia at 58-24, with one of the Sixers' key victories in the regular season being a win in Boston to snap the Celtics' 18-game winning streak. In the 1982 Eastern Finals, Boston attempted to come back from a similar 3-1 predicament and managed to extend the series to seven games, with the seventh game playing in raucous Boston Garden. However, Philadelphia had the last laugh, winning Game 7. In that finale, as Boston fans saw their team losing, they congratulated the Sixers by shouting the now-famous \"Beat L.A.\" chant as the Sixers were about to face the well-rested Lakers. Sixers star Darryl Dawkins told a reporter, \"Man, when I heard that, my dick got stiff.\" In the end, however, the weary Sixers couldn't keep up, losing to the Lakers in the Finals.\n\nThe next season, the Sixers picked up MVP Moses Malone from the Houston Rockets. Malone repeated as the MVP and led the 76ers to an NBA Championship in a 4-game sweep against the Lakers. With the Bucks sweeping Boston, it made the Sixers' title run much easier. However, it was the last title for Philadelphia until the Phillies won the 2008 World Series.\n\nThe \"highlight\" of this era of the rivalry was a 1983 exhibition game that featured 3 separate fights: Moses Malone/Cedric Maxwell, Larry Bird/Marc Iavaroni, and Gerald Henderson/Sedale Threatt. During Bird/Iavaroni, Bird ripped 76ers coach Billy Cunningham's sports jacket in half. The fight was reaching a peak when 66-year-old Red Auerbach came down from the stands to restore order. Witnesses report him calling Malone a \"big schvatzer.\" There was also a memorable 1985 choking match between Bird and Erving.\n\nSince 1984, the only times the two teams met in the playoffs were in 1985, 2002, 2012, and 2018. Though the 1983-84 season saw the Celtics win the title and the Sixers upset in the first round by the New Jersey Nets, the Sixers had a measure of satisfaction in the regular season by winning 4 of their 6 regular season games versus Boston, the only time the Sixers managed to win the regular season series versus Boston in the Larry Bird era. Charles Barkley joined the Sixers for the 1984-85 season, and the 1985 Eastern Final series was the Sixers' last conference final until 2001. In the 1985 Finals, they lost to Boston in five games after Boston had won the first 3 games, including a third game in Philadelphia where Julius Erving was uncharacteristically booed by the home crowd for his poor play. Game 5 saw Larry Bird pick off Andrew Toney with a few seconds left and Boston up by 2, then dribble up court to preserve the Celtics' close victory, reminiscent of John Havlicek's series-clinching steal in 1965.\n\nAfter the 1985 playoffs, the rivalry would die down. Bird and the Celtics would win one more championship in 1986, but the Sixers would not reach another conference finals until 2001. The Sixers saw a steep decline through the rest of the '80's, trading Malone and Cheeks along with the retirements of Erving and Toney. Charles Barkley emerged as the Sixers new leader and a prominent NBA superstar, however he was not able to get the team past the second round. Though considered an MVP candidate in his prime, the Sixers traded him in 1992 and went through a period of rebuilding.\n\nAfter winning the championship in 1986, the Celtics also began a decline that started with tragedy. Two days after they drafted him in the 1986 draft, Len Bias died of a drug overdose. Reggie Lewis died of a heart attack in his prime in 1993. The Celtics then missed the playoffs in 1994, and did not post a winning record until the 2001-02 season.\n\nDespite the 90's being a period of stagnation for both teams, it did produce some key developments. Allen Iverson was drafted by the 76ers as the first overall pick in the 1996 draft, and the Celtics would draft Paul Pierce two years later. Both players would become superstars in the league and lead their respective team into the playoffs numerous times.\n\nIn 2002, the Celtics, in their first appearance since 1995, won the first round meeting 3–2 over the defending conference champion 76ers. That series featured the scoring exploits of Allen Iverson and Paul Pierce.\n\nThe two teams met again in the 2012 Eastern Conference Semifinals, which the Celtics won 4–3. The fourth seeded Celtics defeated the eight seeded Sixers in a tight, back and forth series.\n\nThe teams met again in the 2018 Eastern Conference Semifinals, which the Celtics won 4–1.\n\nBoston sportswriters dubbed Sixers' shooting guard Andrew Toney \"The Boston Strangler\" because of his ability to take control of games against the Celtics. He is remembered for scoring 25 points against Boston in the fourth quarter on March 21, 1982, at the Philadelphia Spectrum. It is still the Sixers' team record for most points scored in a quarter. He also scored a team-high 33 points in the classic Game 7 of the 1982 Eastern Finals in Boston (the famous \"Beat LA!\" game), leading the Sixers to the Finals and avoiding a second straight meltdown in the Eastern Finals versus Boston. Andrew Toney's ability to have big scoring games in the playoffs versus the Celtics was one of the reasons for the Celtics in acquiring defensive ace and Hall of Famer Dennis Johnson from the Phoenix Suns prior to the 1983-84 season, and Johnson would go on to have several great seasons with the Celtics, winning two titles with them in 1984 and 1986.\n\n"}

The two teams played each other in the NBA playoffs five times from 1985–1991, with Boston winning in 1985 and 1987, and Detroit winning en route to three consecutive NBA Finals appearances from 1988 to 1990. The rivalry peaked in the late 1980s, featuring players such as Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Dennis Rodman, Isiah Thomas, Joe Dumars, and Bill Laimbeer.\n\nBetween 1948 and 1978, the Celtics and Pistons were on opposite divisions/conferences in all but three seasons. The Pistons found success in the early 1950s behind George Yardley, making two NBA Finals appearances, while the Celtics soon built a dynasty behind Bill Russell, winning 11 championships between 1957 and 1969.\n\nThe Pistons and Celtics first opposed each other in postseason play in , with the Celtics emerging victorious in six games of the Eastern Division Semifinals. However, the Pistons were generally mediocre for a majority of the 1960s and 1970s, despite the presence of stars such as Dave DeBusschere, Dave Bing and Bob Lanier. Meanwhile, the Celtics continued to rack up championships with Russell, John Havlicek and Dave Cowens leading the way.\n\nIn the 1978 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted Larry Bird who would soon resurrect the franchise's fortunes. Then in the 1981 NBA draft, the Pistons picked Isiah Thomas and along with head coach Chuck Daly he would also play a key role in his team's reemergence.\n\nIt was also in 1978 that the Pistons moved to the Eastern Conference, turning their matchups against the Celtics into an intra-conference affair. The Celtics would win three NBA championships in the 1980s, while the Pistons gradually built a team that eventually became the \"Bad Boys\".\n\nThe two teams met in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, where the Celtics ousted the younger Pistons in six games. But when they reengaged in the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pistons were a vastly different team. The \"Bad Boys\", as Detroit became known, used physical play to intimidate their way to victory. This roused the ire of Boston's players and fans, and the teams' mutual hatred of each other often led to on-court fighting. Detroit's biggest antagonists were Bill Laimbeer, Rick Mahorn and Dennis Rodman. In Game 3, Bird and Laimbeer were ejected for fighting as the Pistons won 122–104.\n\nThe most famous moment of the rivalry occurred during Game 5. Leading 107-106 with 5 seconds left, and Detroit threatening to take a 3–2 series lead, Isiah Thomas had his inbounds pass stolen by Bird, who dished it off to Dennis Johnson for the winning layup. With Parish forced to sit out Game 6 due to a suspension for punching Laimbeer in the second quarter of Game 5 (the first for a playoff game in NBA history; he also re-sprained his right ankle late in Game 5), the Pistons won Game 6 113–105 to send it back to Boston for Game 7. The Celtics ended the bitter series with a 117–114 win in Boston Garden over Detroit.\n\nThe Celtics and Pistons faced off anew in the Eastern Conference Finals. This time the Pistons finally unseated the Celtics, winning the series 4–2 and advancing to the NBA Finals to face the Lakers. What was notable was the fact that Detroit, who entered the series with 21 straight losses at the Boston Garden, beat Boston by winning 2 of 3 there (Games 1 and 5). In Game 5, the Celtics led by 16 before the Pistons rallied to win 102–96 in OT. In addition, their rough play and intense defense made Bird's scoring drop to just 10 points per game on 35.1% shooting, forcing Boston to rely on McHale.\n\nThe next two meetings proved to be anticlimactic. In the First Round, Detroit swept Boston 3–0 en route to their first championship, as the Celtics missed the services of Bird due to injury. Then in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Pistons eliminated the Celtics in six games, but it proved to be the last hurrah for the two aging squads.\n\nThe Celtics and Pistons entered a period of rebuilding during the 1990s. Although the Pistons found a new star in Grant Hill, he was unable to lead the team back to championship contention. Meanwhile, the Celtics endured a long dry spell, not reaching the playoffs for much of the decade.\n\nThe 2000s saw both teams reemerge as contenders. In , the Celtics and Pistons met again in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, featuring new stars in Paul Pierce, Antoine Walker, Jerry Stackhouse and Ben Wallace, respectively. Though Detroit had a better regular season record, the Celtics surprisingly eliminated them in five games, reaching their first Conference Finals since 1988. However, the Pistons would go on to dominate the Eastern Conference, reaching six consecutive Conference Finals, two NBA Finals and winning the 2004 championship. One of the Pistons' key players during that era was Chauncey Billups, who the Celtics drafted third overall in the 1997 NBA draft but would later emerge as a star in Detroit. Meanwhile, the Celtics slid back to mediocrity, but was given a new lease in life during the 2007 offseason.\n\nAfter acquiring Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen, the Celtics and Pistons renewed the rivalry as they met in the Eastern Conference Finals. However, the grind of reaching six straight conference finals took its toll on Detroit as Boston toppled their rivals in six games, eventually winning the championship that year.\n\nThe 2010s saw both teams head into opposite directions. Detroit endured a lengthy rebuild with only two playoff appearances, while Boston maintained its status as a playoff contender behind new stars such as Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Kyrie Irving and Kemba Walker.\n\n\n"}

Luke (Lk 2.7) does not mention animals, but a manger. In the apocryphal Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, both animals are specifically named. The image continued to spread from the 13th century onwards when it was included in the \"Golden Legend\". It became the most popular symbol for the mystery of the self-abasement of God in his Incarnation. (Phil 2,6–7).\n\nThe second part of the responsory relates to the words with which Elizabeth welcomes Mary, mother of Jesus on her visitation (Lk 1.42–43).\n\nComposed in 1994 by Morten Lauridsen, American composer. The piece mimics classic Gregorian choral pieces in its style but with some modern influence as well. Speaking of the piece Lauridsen said \"I wanted this piece to resonate immediately and deeply into the core of the listener, to illumine through sound.\" The music pulls its lyrics from the responsorial chant shown above. Lauridsen accounts that his inspiration for the piece came from a painting he saw in the Norton Simon Museum titled “Still Life with Lemons, Oranges and a Rose” (1633) by Spanish Baroque artist Francisco de Zurbarán, which Lauridsen said was symbolism for the Virgin Mary. Lauridsen said he worked on the piece over a period of six months and put considerable thinking into a certain dissonant note to comment on the sorrow that the Virgin Mary would later face as her son was killed.\n\n"}
{"id": "2097287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097287", "title": "Psycho II (film)", "text": "Psycho II (film)\n\nPsycho II is a 1983 American slasher film directed by Richard Franklin, written by Tom Holland, and starring Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, Robert Loggia, and Meg Tilly. It is the first sequel to Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho\" and the second film in the \"Psycho\" franchise. Set 22 years after the first film, it follows Norman Bates after he is released from the mental institution and returns to the house and Bates Motel to continue a normal life. However, his troubled past continues to haunt him. It is unrelated to the 1982 novel \"Psycho II\" by Robert Bloch, which he wrote as a sequel to his original novel \"Psycho\".\n\nIn preparing the film, Universal hired Holland to write an entirely different screenplay, while Australian director Franklin, a one-time student of Hitchcock, was hired to direct. The film marked Franklins's American feature film debut.\n\n\"Psycho II\" was released on June 3, 1983, and grossed $34.7 million at the box office on a budget of $5 million. It received mixed-to-positive reviews from film critics. The film was followed by \"Psycho III\" (1986).\n\nAfter 22 years in a mental institution, Norman Bates has been cured of his insanity and accepted that his mother is dead. As such, the court has him released. Marion's sister Lila, who married Marion's lover Sam Loomis, vehemently protests, but her plea is dismissed. Against the advice of Dr. Bill Raymond, Norman takes up residence in his old home behind the Bates Motel. He reports to a prearranged job at a nearby diner, where an old lady named Emma Spool works. After work, a young waitress at the diner, Mary Samuels, has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey, has been using the motel for dealing drugs. He immediately fires Toomey.\n\nNorman's assimilation into society appears to be going well until he begins to receive mysterious phone calls and notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. During a work shift, a drunk Toomey picks a fight with Norman, and he suspects him of the notes and phone calls. Shortly after, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death as he is packing to leave the motel.\nBecoming increasingly sympathetic to and impressed by Norman's fight to keep his sanity, Mary takes up permanent residence in a guest room at his house. While Norman is renovating his motel, he hears voices in the house, and enters his mother's bedroom to find it exactly as it was 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Meanwhile, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window to have sex. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts police. Mary finds Norman in the attic and he shows her his mother's bedroom, only to find it back to its state of disuse. The sheriff arrives and questions them about the boy's murder. Mary claims they were out walking together at the time. After the sheriff leaves, Norman rebukes her for lying. He fears he may have killed the boy, since Mary told him the attic was unlocked when she found him.\n\nThat evening, Mary and Norman find a bloody rag stuffed in the toilet. Norman is horrified, believing he committed another murder, but Mary insists he is innocent. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, her mother; Lila and Mary have in fact been making the phone calls and notes, even posing at the window dressed as Norma Bates. Mary altered Norman's room and locked Norman in the attic so she could change it back. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted. However, Mary's growing friendship with Norman has convinced her he is no longer capable of killing. She suspects someone else is in the house, pointing out that Norman was locked in the attic at the time of the boy's death.\n\nDr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and tells Norman that Mary and Lila must be the ones harassing him. He also has the corpse of Norma Bates exhumed, to prove Norman is not being haunted by his mother. Norman is only partially convinced, saying the one behind everything must be his \"real mother\", despite there being no record of him being adopted. Norman confronts Mary with what Dr. Raymond told him. She says that she has given up her part in Lila's ruse, but Lila will not stop. Later, Norman becomes too terrified to leave his room, saying he saw his real mother in the house. Mary admits to Norman that his sanity is beginning to erode and stays to comfort him.\n\nWhile Lila is retrieving her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the cellar floor, a figure steps out of the shadows and murders her. Meanwhile, the police dredge the swamp and find a car, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Mary runs to the house to try to convince Norman to flee. The phone rings, Norman answers, and starts speaking to \"Mother\". Mary listens in; nobody is on the line with Norman. While Norman debates with \"Mother\" about her command to kill Mary, Mary runs into the cellar and dresses up as Mother, complete with butcher knife, in an unsuccessful bid to get Norman to \"hang up\". Dr. Raymond grabs her from behind, thinking he has caught her in the act of trying to drive Norman insane, and in her fright Mary plunges the butcher knife into his heart. Confronted by the sight of \"Mother\" standing over Dr. Raymond's bloody corpse, Norman's sanity snaps and he advances upon Mary, babbling. Mary backs into the fruit cellar and stumbles upon Lila's body, buried in a pile of coal. Assuming Norman is responsible, Mary raises her knife to kill him but is shot dead by the incoming police. The ensuing investigation is inconclusive, but in light of an overheard argument between Mary and Lila, Mary's attempt to kill Norman, and her dressing as Norma Bates, the police deduce Mary most likely committed all the murders.\n\nLater, Emma Spool, the diner co-worker, visits Norman. Spool tells Norman she is his real mother, and that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Spool was institutionalized. She reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. In response, Norman strikes her in the head with a shovel, killing her. He then carries the body upstairs to Mother's room, and begins talking to himself in her voice, signifying that Norman’s “Mother” personality has once again taken control of his mind.\n\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel \"Psycho II\", which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Concerned by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work. Australian director Richard Franklin, who was Hitchcock's student and even visited him on the set of \"Topaz\", was hired to direct \"Psycho II\". Universal hired writer Tom Holland to write the screenplay.\n\nHilton A. Green, assistant director of the original \"Psycho\", was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter Patricia Hitchcock and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film; saying that her father would have loved it.\n\nOriginally, the film was intended as a made-for-cable production. Anthony Perkins originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of Norman Bates, but when he read the script he agreed to do the film. Perkins said, \"When I received Tom Holland's script, I liked it very much. It was really Norman's story...\" Before landing Perkins, the studio was exploring recasting the part and Christopher Walken was among those considered.\n\nPrincipal photography of \"Psycho II\" took place at Universal Studios in Universal City, California on Soundstage 24 from June 30–August 13, 1982. The Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed. Similarly to the original film, it was mostly shot on the Universal backlot and in a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers John W. Corso and Julie Fletcher, including two Tiffany lamps, the stuffed owl and raven, the brass hands seen in Mrs. Bates's bedroom, the bedroom fireplace, the Victorian bed and armoire, and the 40-foot-long threadbare runner for the staircase. The exterior of the house featured in the original film was relocated to a different section of the Universal Studios lot for the production. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually Courthouse Square, which is probably best known for its appearance in \"Back to the Future\" (1985), located on the Universal Studios backlot.\n\nBoth Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock and the original film. To accomplish this, they added various in-jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on, Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette is visible on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. The final pages of the shooting script were not distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming.\n\nThe last shot of the film with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one sheet film poster, director Franklin was not pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\".\n\nReflecting on the shoot, Franklin recalled Perkins as being \"very generous\" on-set, and praised Miles as a \"powerhouse\" and \"one of the most forceful\" actors he had worked with.\n\nComposer John Williams was considered to do the score for the film, but it was decided to go with composer Jerry Goldsmith. Goldsmith was a long-time friend of original film composer Bernard Herrmann. On some film assignments Goldsmith would discover that the director had used some of Herrmann's music from other films as temporary soundtracks. Goldsmith would often joke when he discovered this (\"Not Benny again!\"); when he conducted a rerecording of \"The Murder\" for the opening of \"Psycho II\" he suggested that Herrmann \"must be rolling over in his grave.\"\n\nGoldsmith had written a theme for Norman Bates that was rejected but used for the second segment of \"\".\n\nMCA Records released a 30-minute album on LP and cassette; in 2014 Intrada issued the complete score.\n\nWhen the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend at No. 2 (behind \"Return of the Jedi\") and went on to gross over $34 million.\n\n\"Variety\" deemed the film \"an impressive, 23-years-after followup to Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 suspense classic\". Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the film \"has all of the characteristics of a conventional sequel to Hitchcock's 1960 classic but, as you watch it, you may feel as if you're seeing a couple of precocious film students play with artifacts found in the Hitchcock mausoleum\". Gary Arnold, writing for \"The Washington Post\", was even less laudatory, referring to the film as \"a travesty masquerading as a sequel...if Franklin had any respect for the source material, he might feel a little protective and avoid outrages as conceptually, as well as literally, nasty as the treatment of Vera Miles' character. \"Psycho II\" transforms her once sympathetic, heroic supporting role into a hateful bit part and then kills her off with a revoltingly obscene flourish. Has movie storytelling broken down this grotesquely in 23 years?\"\n\nA review published in the \"Detroit Free Press\" praised the film as \"jumpy fun\" and \"another cult film in the making\".\n\nChristopher John reviewed \"Psycho II\" in \"Ares Magazine\" #15 and commented that \"the real importance of \"Psycho II\" rests in its originality. Refusing to be just a blood-letting free-for-all, the picture goes to great lengths to create an entirely new story.\"\n\nFilm scholar John Kenneth Muir praised the film's depiction of Bates in \"human, realistic terms,\" deeming it \"admirably frank and sincere\" and \"a great film on its own merits.\" In \"Empire\", film critic Kim Newman gave the film three out of five stars, calling \"Psycho II\" \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing, \"The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world \"wants\" Norman to be mad, and ‘normality’ can only be restored if he’s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 59% approval rating and an average rating of 5.27/10 based on 34 reviews. The site's consensus states; \"Although it can't hold a cleaver to the classic original, \"Psycho II\" succeeds well enough on its own merits to satisfy horror fans.\" Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that, while the film sustained the suspenseful atmosphere of the original and is better than the average slasher film, the film was too heavy on the plot and was too willing to cheat about its plot to be successful.\n\n\"Psycho II\" has been released five times on DVD. The initial release came in 1999 when Universal Studios leased the film out to GoodTimes Home Video in a 1.33:1 open matte transfer. The second release came in 2005 from Universal itself. The third release came in 2007 as part of a triple feature package with \"Psycho III\" and \"\". Shout Factory, under their Scream Factory logo, released \"Psycho II\" on DVD & Blu-Ray on September 24, 2013 under their \"Collector's Edition\" line-up.\n\nOn May 8, 2013, RiffTrax released a VOD commentary on the film. On September 2, 2014, Universal released \"Psycho II\", \"Psycho III\", \"Psycho IV: The Beginning\" and the 1987 TV-movie \"Bates Motel\" on DVD as part of its \"4-Movie Midnight Marathon Pack\".\n\n\n\n"}

When Te Kooti's forces were defeated at the siege of Ngatapa, in 1869, around 270 people were taken prisoner. Along with four other survivors (Hetariki Te Oikau, Matene Te Karo, Rewi Tamanui Totitoti, and Wi Tamararo), Pere was taken to Wellington, where he was put on trial for high treason against the British crown. Pere and Tamararo were also charged with murder.\n\nThree of the accused, Te Oikau, Te Karo, and Totitoti, began their trial on 20 September 1869, and were found guilty after four days. They were sentenced to be hanged, then beheaded, and then quartered — this was the mandatory sentence for treason, although the judge indicated that perhaps the beheading and quartering would not actually be carried out. Pere and Tamararo were to be tried separately, as they were accused of murder as well as treason. Tamararo's trial began on 27 September, although treason charges were dropped, leaving only charges of murder. He was found guilty and sentenced to the same punishment as the others.\n\nWhen Pere himself began his trial, the murder charges were dropped, leaving only the charge of treason. Pere's defence focused on three primary claims:\n\nPere was supported in his trial by Maata Te Owai, one of Te Kooti's wives. Te Owai testified that Pere had not joined Te Kooti's forces willingly. Other evidence indicated that Pere had been present when several murders of colonists took place, although no uncorroborated evidence was presented that Pere had actually committed or condoned the crime. (Oddly, this evidence better fits the charge of murder than the charge of treason, but it was the charge of murder that was abandoned.) In the end, Pere was found guilty of treason. The judge deferred Pere's sentencing for a time, but eventually ordered the same punishment as for the others.\n\nWi Tamararo had committed suicide two days after being sentenced, leaving only four of the convicted alive. Later, on 13 October, the Governor chose to commute the sentence of Hetariki Te Oikau to life imprisonment. On 2 November, a surprise decision also commuted the sentences of Matene Te Karo and Rewi Tamanui Totitoti. This left Pere as the only person facing execution. Addressing Pere's case directly, the Executive Council claimed that Pere's participation in the war had been voluntary, and accused him of active involvement in murders of colonists. It also said that Pere, unlike some others, had no tribal allegiances which compelled him to participate.\n\nPere was hanged in Wellington on 16 November 1869. He is the only New Zealander ever to be executed on charges of treason, with all other executees having been convicted of murder. As capital punishment in New Zealand is no longer in effect, he is expected to retain this distinction permanently.\n\nMore recently, Hamiora Pere's case has been re-examined, with some claiming that he was treated unfairly. It has been alleged that if the three other accused had their sentences commuted, Pere should have been treated the same way — there was no corroborated evidence that Pere had actually committed murder. (It is argued that the Crown realised this, and that this is why the separate murder charge was dropped.) According to some theories, Pere was executed not because he was deemed to have deserved it, but because the government \"needed someone to hang\" to satisfy public opinion or to serve as an example. Wi Tamararo, against whom the strongest evidence of murder was presented, deprived the government of a hanging by committing suicide, leaving Pere as the only real candidate. In the minutes of the Executive Council, an opinion was noted that \"one execution will be [as] useful as more would have been by way of example and caution\".\n"}

{"id": "2097316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097316", "title": "Kursk submarine disaster", "text": "Kursk submarine disaster\n\nThe nuclear-powered \"Kursk\" (Russian: ) sank in an accident on 12 August 2000 in the Barents Sea, during the first major Russian naval exercise in more than ten years, and all 118 personnel on board were killed. The crews of nearby ships felt the initial explosion and a second, much larger, explosion, yet the Russian Navy did not realise that an accident had occurred and did not initiate a search for the sub for more than six hours. By the time the Navy declared an emergency 11 hours later, the crew had all died, although no observers knew that. Because the submarine's emergency rescue buoy had been intentionally disabled during an earlier mission, it took more than 16 hours to locate the sunken boat. \n\nOver four days, the Russian Navy repeatedly failed in its attempts to attach four different diving bells and submersibles to the escape hatch of the submarine. Its response was criticised as slow and inept. Officials misled and manipulated the public and news media, and refused help from other governments. President Vladimir Putin initially continued his vacation at a seaside resort; he authorised the Russian Navy to accept British and Norwegian offers of assistance only after five days had passed since the accident. Seven days after the sinking, British and Norwegian divers finally opened a hatch to the escape trunk in the boat's flooded ninth compartment but found no survivors. The Government of Russia and the Russian Navy were intensely criticised over the incident and their responses.\n\nMost of the wreck was raised and analyzed. The official investigation concluded that, as the crew of \"Kursk\" was preparing to load a dummy 65–76 \"Kit\" torpedo, a faulty weld in its casing leaked high-test peroxide (HTP), causing the torpedo's kerosene fuel to explode. The explosion blew off both the inner and outer tube doors, ignited a fire, destroyed the bulkhead between the first and second compartments, damaged the control room in the second compartment, and incapacitated or killed the control room crew. The torpedo manufacturer challenged this hypothesis, insisting that its design would prevent the kind of event described. \n\nVice-Admiral Valery Ryazantsev drew attention to systemic faults in the Russian Navy, such as the risky use of highly volatile HTP torpedoes, known to have exploded and caused the sinking of . Ryazantsev accused the Russian navy of failing to properly train the crew, who did not appear to have properly closed the internal tube hatch cover. Eventually, the commission concluded that poor oversight, budget cuts, and incomplete maintenance inspections contributed to the explosion.\n\nTwo minutes and fifteen seconds after the initial blast, the sub had reached the sea floor when the intense initial fire triggered the detonation of between five and seven torpedo warheads. The second explosion was equivalent to over two tonnes of TNT. It collapsed the bulkheads between the first three compartments and all the decks, tore a large hole in the hull, destroyed compartment four, and killed everyone still alive forward of the nuclear reactor in the fifth compartment. The nuclear reactors shut down safely. \n\nFollowing salvage operations, analysts concluded that 23 sailors in the sixth through ninth compartments reached refuge in the small ninth compartment and survived for more than six hours. As oxygen ran low, crew members attempted to replace a potassium superoxide chemical oxygen cartridge, which accidentally fell into the oily sea water and exploded on contact. The resulting fire killed several crew members and triggered a flash fire that consumed the remaining oxygen, suffocating the remaining survivors. Lacking information, families of the victims engaged in an angry and volatile meeting with newly elected President Vladimir Putin. The video coverage of the meeting was sanitised for Russian audiences but leaked to international media. Russian audiences were shocked when they later saw this footage, which showed a distraught wife and mother being forcibly sedated before she was removed from the meeting.\n\nMammoet was awarded the salvaging contract in May, 2001, with the winter weather starting in early October. Within a 3-month period, over 3,000 tons of tailor-made equipment was designed, fabricated, installed and commissioned onto a barge which was mobilized to the Barents Sea in August to raise the hull. Using the tailor-made equipment, they recovered all but the bow, including the remains of 115 sailors, who were buried in Russia. More than two years after the sinking, the Russian government completed a 133-volume, top-secret investigation of the disaster. They released only a four-page summary through \"Rossiyskaya Gazeta\", that revealed \"stunning breaches of discipline, shoddy, obsolete and poorly maintained equipment\", and \"negligence, incompetence, and mismanagement\". Moreover, they concluded that the rescue operation was unjustifiably delayed and that the Russian Navy was completely unprepared to respond to the disaster.\n\nOn the morning of 12 August 2000, \"Kursk\" was participating in the \"Summer-X\" exercise, the first large-scale naval exercise planned by the Russian Navy in more than a decade, and also its first since the fall of the Soviet Union. It consisted of 30 ships and three submarines.\n\n\"Kursk\" had recently won a citation for its excellent performance and been recognised as having the best submarine crew in the Northern Fleet. Although this was an exercise, \"Kursk\" loaded a full complement of conventional combat weapons. It was one of the few submarines authorised to carry a combat load at all times. This included 18 SS-N-16 \"Stallion\" anti-submarine missiles and 24 SS-N-19/P-700 Granit \"Shipwreck\" cruise missiles, which were designed to defeat the best naval air defences.\n\n\"Kursk\" had a mythical standing. It was reputedly unsinkable and there were claims it would withstand a direct hit from a torpedo. The outer hull was constructed using steel\nplate covered by up to of rubber, which minimised other submarines' or surface\nvessels' ability to detect the submarine. The inner pressure hull was made of high-quality steel plate. The two hulls were separated by a gap. The inner hull was divided into nine water-tight compartments. The boat was as long as two jumbo jets.\n\nAt 08:51 local time, \"Kursk\" requested permission to conduct a torpedo training launch and received the response \"\" (\"Good\"). After considerable delay, the submarine was set to fire two dummy torpedoes at the . At 11:29 local time, the torpedo room crew loaded the first practice Type 65 \"Kit\" torpedo, (Russian: , or \"fat girl\", because of its size), without a warhead, into \"Kursk\"s number 4 torpedo tube on the starboard side. It was long and weighed .\n\nAt 11:29:34 (07:29:50 GMT), seismic detectors at the Norwegian seismic array (NORSAR) and in other locations around the world recorded a seismic event of magnitude 1.5 on the Richter scale. The location was fixed at coordinates , north-east of Murmansk, approximately from Norway, and from the Kola Peninsula.\n\nAt 11:31:48, two minutes and 14 seconds after the first, a second event, measuring 4.2 on the Richter scale, or 250 times larger than the first, was registered on seismographs across northern Europe and was detected as far away as Alaska. The second explosion was equivalent to 2–3 tons of TNT.\n\nThe seismic data showed that the explosion occurred at the same depth as the sea bed. The seismic event, triangulated at , showed that the boat had moved about from the site of the initial explosion. It was enough time for the submarine to sink and remain on the sea floor for a short period.\n\nThe crew of the submarine \"Karelia\" detected the explosion but the captain assumed that it was part of the exercise. Aboard \"Petr Velikiy\", the target of the practice launch, the crew detected a hydro-acoustic signal characteristic of an underwater explosion and felt their hull shudder. They reported the phenomena to fleet headquarters but their report was ignored.\n\nThe scheduled time period for \"Kursk\" to complete the practice torpedo firing expired at 13:30 without any contact from the sub. Accustomed to the frequent failure of communications equipment, Fleet Commander Admiral Vyacheslav Alekseyevich Popov aboard \"Petr Velikiy\" was not initially alarmed. The ship dispatched a helicopter to look for \"Kursk\" but it was unable to locate the sub on the surface; this was reported to Popov.\n\nThe Northern Fleet duty officer notified the head of the fleet's search and rescue forces, Captain Alexander Teslenko, to stand by for orders. Teslenko's primary rescue ship was a 20-year-old former lumber carrier, \"Mikhail Rudnitsky\", which had been converted to support submersible rescue operations. Teslenko notified the ship's captain to be ready to depart on one hour's notice. Berthed at the primary Northern Fleet base at Severomorsk, the ship was equipped with two AS-32 and AS-34 , a diving bell, underwater video cameras, lifting cranes, and other specialised gear. But she was not equipped with stabilisers capable of keeping the vessel in position during stormy weather and could lower her rescue vessels only in calm seas. The Russian Navy had previously operated two s, each of which carried a pair of Poseidon class DSRVs that could reach a depth of , but due to a lack of funds, the vessels had been held since 1994 in a St. Petersburg yard for pending repairs.\n\nAt 17:00, an Ilyushin 38 aircraft was dispatched and its crew looked for \"Kursk\" for three hours without spotting anything. One hour later, at 18:00, more than six hours after the explosion, \"Kursk\" failed to complete a scheduled communication check. The Northern Fleet command became concerned and tried to contact the boat. After repeated failures, at 18:30 they began a search and rescue operation, dispatching additional aircraft to locate the submarine, which again failed to locate the boat on the surface. At 22:30, the Northern Fleet declared an emergency, and the exercise was stopped. Between fifteen and twenty-two vessels of the Northern Fleet, including about 3,000 sailors, began searching for the submarine. The \"Mikhail Rudnitsky\" left port at 00:30.\n\nThe Russian Navy initially downplayed the incident. Late on Saturday night, nine hours after the boat sank, Northern Fleet commander Admiral Popov ordered the first search for the submarine. Twelve hours after it sank, Popov informed the Kremlin, but Minister of Defence Igor Sergeyev did not notify Putin until 07:00 Sunday morning. Sergeyev \"did not recommend\" that Putin visit the disaster site.\n\nOn Sunday, after Popov already knew that \"Kursk\" was missing and presumed sunk, he briefed reporters on the progress of the naval exercise. He said the exercise had been a resounding success and spoke highly of the entire operation.\n\nEarly on Sunday morning at the Vidyaevo Naval Base, rumours began to circulate among family members of \"Kursk\"s crew that something was wrong. A telephone operator handled an unusual volume of calls and she overheard that a submarine was in trouble and the boat's name. The base was very small and news spread quickly. The wives and family members exchanged news, but nobody had more information. \"Kursk\" had previously been regarded as unsinkable and so family members could not believe the worst of the rumours. They hoped that the submarine was just temporarily unable to communicate. The deputy base commander reassured the women that the headquarters office was half empty and that the officers present were just \"passing the time.\"\n\nOn the afternoon of the explosion, before the Kremlin had been informed of the submarine's sinking, U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger and Defense Secretary William Cohen were told that \"Kursk\" had sunk. Once officially informed, the British government, along with France, Germany, Israel, Italy, and Norway offered help, and the United States offered the use of one of its two deep submergence rescue vehicles, but the Russian government refused all foreign assistance. Minister of Defence Igor Sergeyev told the American Embassy that the rescue was well under way. The Russian Navy told reporters that a rescue was imminent.\n\nAt 04:50 on Sunday, personnel aboard \"Petr Velikiy\" found two anomalies on the seabed that might be the boat. At 09:00 \"Mikhail Rudnitsky\" arrived at the location. While setting anchor, its crew interpreted an acoustic sound as an SOS from the submarine, but soon concluded the noise had been produced by the anchor chain striking the anchor hole. At 11:30 on Sunday, 13 August, the crew of \"Mikhail Rudnitsky\" began preparing to lower the AS-34, which entered the water at 17:30. At 18:30, at a depth of and at a speed of , the AS-34 reported colliding with an object, and through a porthole the crew reported seeing the \"Kursk\"s propeller and stern stabiliser. The AS-34 was damaged by the collision and surfaced, so the crew of \"Mikhail Rudnitsky\" began preparing the AS-32 for operations.\n\nAt 22:40, the AS-32 entered the water and began searching for \"Kursk\" but, given an incorrect heading by personnel aboard \"Petr Velikiy,\" it was unable to locate the submarine. Crew aboard \"Mikhail Rudnitsky\" tried to contact \"Kursk\" and briefly thought they heard an acoustic SOS signal, but this was determined to be of biological origin. They reported the sounds to \"Petr Velikiy\". The AS-32 returned to the surface at 01:00 on Monday morning, 14 August.\n\nThe salvage tug \"Nikolay Chiker\" (SB 131) arrived early in the rescue operation. It used its deep water camera equipment to obtain the first images of the wrecked submarine. Video camera pictures showed severe damage from the sub's bow to its sail. They also revealed that \"Kursk\" was listing at a 60-degree angle and down 5–7 degrees by the bow. The bow had ploughed about deep into the clay seabed, at a depth of . The periscope was raised, indicating that the accident occurred when the submarine was at a depth of less than .\n\nThe AS-34 was repaired and was launched at 05:00 on Monday. At 06:50, the AS-34 located \"Kursk\" and unsuccessfully tried to attach to the aft escape trunk over \"Kursk\"s ninth compartment. It was unable to create the vacuum seal necessary to attach to the escape trunk and its batteries were quickly depleted. The crew was forced to surface. When the crew discovered that no spare batteries were available, they were forced to wait while the batteries were recharged. Winds meanwhile increased, blowing to , and the waves rose to 3–4 points (), forcing the Russians to suspend rescue operations.\n\nThe first official announcement of the accident was made by the Russians on Monday, 14 August. They told the media that \"Kursk\" had had \"minor technical difficulties\" on Sunday. They stated that the submarine had \"descended to the ocean floor\", that they had established contact with the crew and were pumping air and power to the boat, and that \"everyone on board is alive.\" The BBC reported that the \"Kursk\" crew \"had been forced to ground\" the submarine because it \"[had] broken down during exercises,\" but rescue crews were \"in radio contact with surface vessels.\"\n\nSenior officers in the Russian Navy offered a variety of explanations for the accident. Four days after \"Kursk\" sank, Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief and Fleet Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov stated the accident had been caused by a serious collision. Vice-premier Ilya Klebanov said the submarine might have hit an old World War II mine. He also said that almost all of the sailors had died before the vessel hit bottom.\n\nThe Russian government convened a commission, chaired by vice-premier Ilya Klebanov, on 14 August, two days after \"Kursk\" sank. Nearly half of the commission members were officials with a stake in the outcome of the investigation. Independent investigators were not invited to take part, giving the appearance that the commission's findings might not be impartial.\n\nBad weather, waves, strong undersea currents, and limited visibility impaired the rescue crews' ability to conduct operations on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Tuesday \"Mikhail Rudnitsky\" lowered a diving bell twice but were unable to connect to the sub. They also tried and failed to manoeuvre a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) onto the rescue hatch.\n\nAt 20:00 Tuesday, AS-34 was launched again but was damaged when it struck a boom as it was being lowered into the sea. It was brought back aboard, repaired, and relaunched at 21:10. On Tuesday, 15 August, three days after the sinking, the crane ship \"PK-7500\" arrived with the more manoeuvrable Project 18270 Bester-type DSRV (AC-36). But the weather prevented the PK-7500 from launching the DSRV. The rescue team decided to launch the submersible near the coast and tow it to the rescue site with a salvage tug.\n\nOn Wednesday, 16 August, at 00:20, AS-34 twice attempted to attach to the ninth compartment escape hatch but was unsuccessful. It surfaced and, as it was being lifted onto the deck of the mother ship, its propulsion system was seriously damaged. The crew of \"Mikhail Rudnitsky\" cannibalised the AS-32 to repair the AS-34. Rescue operations were suspended while the repairs were made. \"PK-7500\" arrived from the coast where it had launched its DSRV. It repeatedly lowered the rescue vessel to the submarine but it was unable to latch onto an escape hatch. One of the rescue capsules was damaged by the storm.\n\nOn Thursday at 12:00, Popov reported to the General Staff of the Navy that no explosion had occurred on the \"Kursk\", that the sub was intact on the seafloor, and that an \"external influence\" might have caused a leak between the first and second compartments. On Thursday the Russian Priz DSRV made another attempt to reach the aft area of the submarine, but it was unable to create the vacuum seal necessary to attach to the escape trunk. Western media criticised the Russians' 32-hour response time; however, the standard for deploying a recovery vessel in 2000 was 72 hours.\n\nThe rescue ship \"Altay\" attempted to attach a Kolokol diving bell to the sub but was unsuccessful. Russian Navy Headquarters in Moscow told media that rescuers had heard tapping from within the boat's hull, spelling \"SOS ... water\", although the possibility of hearing tapping through the double hull was later discounted. Other reports said the sounds had been misinterpreted or were made up.\n\nRescue divers did not attempt to tap on the hull to signal potential survivors acoustically. However, video evidence seems to suggest otherwise, as it shows Norwegian divers tapping on the aft rescue hatch while the rescue part of the operation was still underway.\n\nFragments of both the outer and inner hulls were found nearby, including a piece of \"Kursk\"s nose weighing , indicating a large explosion in the forward torpedo room.\n\nPrivate media and state-owned Russian newspapers criticised the navy's refusal to accept international assistance. Five days after the accident on 17 August 2000, President Putin accepted the British and Norwegian governments' offer of assistance. Six teams of British and Norwegian divers arrived on Friday, 18 August. The Russian 328th Expeditionary rescue squad, part of the Navy's office of Search and Rescue, also provided divers. On 19 August at 20:00, the Norwegian ship \"Normand Pioneer\" arrived with the British rescue submarine \"LR5\" on board, seven days after the disaster.\n\nOn Sunday 20 August, the Norwegians lowered a ROV to the submarine. They found that the first of the boat was a mass of twisted metal and debris.\n\nRussian Navy officials imposed specific constraints that restricted the Norwegian divers to work on the stern of the boat, specifically the escape hatch over compartment nine and an air control valve connected to the rescue trunk. The Norwegian deep-sea divers protested against the restrictions, which they believed impeded their rescue operations.\n\nWhen the divers attempted to open the air control valve, it would not move. Russian experts on one of the most technologically advanced submarines in the Russian fleet told the divers that they must open the valve counter-clockwise or they would break it. The divers finally went against the experts' advice and tried turning it clockwise, which worked.\n\nThe divers tried to use the arms of the ROV to open the hatch but were unsuccessful until the morning of Monday, 21 August; they found the rescue trunk full of water. That morning, they used a custom tool to open the internal hatch of the rescue trunk, releasing a large volume of air from the ninth compartment. Divers lowered a video camera on a rod into the compartment and could see several bodies.\n\nThe salvage companies agreed that the Norwegian divers would cut the holes in the hull but only Russian divers would enter the submarine. The Norwegian divers cut a hole in the hull of the eighth compartment to gain access, using a cutting machine that shoots a high-velocity water-and-cutting-grit mix at pressure. The Russian divers entered the wreck and opened a bulkhead hatch to compartment nine.\n\nThey found that dust and ashes inside compartment nine severely restricted visibility. As they gradually worked their way inside the compartment and down two levels, Warrant Officer Sergei Shmygin found the remains of Captain-lieutenant . All of the men had clearly been badly burned. The divers cut additional holes in the hull over the third and fourth compartments. The Russian divers removed secret documents and eventually recovered a total of 12 bodies from the ninth compartment. This contradicted earlier statements made by senior Russian officials that all of the submariners had died before the submarine hit the bottom. They also found the boat's log, but had to suspend work because of severe weather. The rescue teams conducted ongoing measurements of radiation levels inside and outside the submarine, but none of the readings exceeded normal ranges.\n\nOn 21 August, after the Norwegian divers confirmed that no one was alive in the ninth compartment, the Chief of Staff of the Russian Northern Fleet, Mikhail Motsak, announced to the public that the \"Kursk\" was flooded and all of its crewmembers had died. Admiral Popov, commander of the Northern Fleet, also addressed the public in a televised broadcast (at the end of which he removed his navy beret) and asked the Kursk family members for forgiveness: \"...forgive me for not bringing back your boys.\"\n\nAdditional plans were made to continue to remove the bodies, but the Russian Navy could not agree on a contract with a foreign company. The families of those who died on the submarine protested that they did not want additional lives put at risk to bring up the dead. On 22 August, President Putin issued an executive order declaring 23 August a day of mourning.\n\nOn Monday 14 August, Fleet Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov stated the accident had been caused by a serious collision with a NATO submarine, although he gave no evidence to support his statement. Senior commanders of the Russian Navy repeated this false account for more than two years after the disaster. Many who wanted to continue negative relations between Russia and the West supported this scenario.\n\nDuring the exercise, the Russians had required each of their submarines to stay within a specified area. This was designed to eliminate the possibility of a collision and to allow surface ships to detect the presence of a Western spy sub.\n\nOn 29 or 30 August 2000, an official government commission tasked with investigating the disaster announced that the likely cause of the sinking was a \"strong 'dynamic external impact' corresponding with the 'first event'\", probably a collision with a foreign submarine or a large surface ship, or striking a World War II mine. They said that the exercise had been monitored by two American submarines— and —and the Royal Navy . When the exercise was cancelled due to the accident, these ships put in at European ports.\n\nUnited States Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen responded to Russian accusations of a collision with a submarine at a press conference in Tokyo on 22 September 2000.\n\nWhile the official inquiry was still under way, on 25 October 2000, Commander of the Northern Fleet Popov and his Chief of Staff Motsak were interviewed by the Spanish newspaper \"El Mundo\". They repeated the theory that \"Kursk\" collided with a NATO submarine shadowing the exercise. Fleet Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov stated again on 25 October that he was 80 percent certain the accident was caused by a collision with a foreign submarine. There had been 11 collisions between submarines in the Barents Sea since 1967. The Russian navy produced video footage of the wreck that they claimed showed evidence that this, too, resulted from a collision.\n\nOn 5 November, a representative of the Northern Fleet General Staff told the Russian NTV television station that the sinking was caused by a collision. Admiral Mikhail Motsak repeated this assertion on 17 November in an interview with the Russian newspaper \"Izvestia\". Officials insisted that an American submarine was closely shadowing \"Kursk\" and had caused the collision by getting too close. The Russian Navy produced satellite imagery of the U.S. submarine \"Memphis\" docked at a Norwegian naval base in Bergen just after the alleged collision and claimed this proved the submarine had surfaced for repairs, but the authenticity of the photos was never proven.\n\nBut geophysicists who analysed the seismic signals concluded and reported in February 2001 that the initial sound recorded was triggered by an explosion and not a collision with another vessel. The seismic waveforms of the second event, known by then to be from the explosion of several torpedo warheads, also generated a high-frequency bubble signature characteristic of an underwater explosion of approximately 3–7 tons of TNT. When analysts compared the second event with the first, they concluded that the first event was also the explosion of a torpedo. Britain's Blacknest seismic monitoring station, which studies seismic signals generated by underground nuclear explosions and earthquakes, identified two distinct explosions. They determined that the two shockwaves were a perfect match and consistent with a torpedo explosion.\n\nWhile the rescue crews repeatedly failed to attach to the rescue trunk and to contact potential survivors aboard the submarine, President Putin was shown on TV enjoying himself on a summer holiday at a villa on the Black Sea. His seeming indifference outraged the families of the \"Kursk\" sailors and many other Russians. Amelia Gentleman in \"The Guardian\" wrote:\n\nThe Russian media strongly criticised the government's response to and handling of the sinking. Images of angry family members demanding information or waiting anxiously at the dock for news were shown on media worldwide. Some relatives said they learned of the disaster only from the public media or from conflicting rumours circulating at the navy base. They complained they did not receive any information from the government on the status of the disaster or rescue efforts until Wednesday, five days after the sinking. Some were unable to confirm whether their family members were among the crew on board the boat. The government refused to release a list of the missing sailors even to the families of those aboard; a \"Pravda\" reporter paid an officer 18,000 rubles to get the list. Even then, the government tried to prohibit reporters from contacting family members.\n\nThe continued problems that the rescuers had in reaching potential survivors and ongoing conflicting information about the cause of the accident inflamed Russian public opinion. Media described the Russian government's response to the disaster as \"technically inept\" and their stories as \"totally unreliable\".\n\nPresident Putin had been advised by the military from the start of the disaster that they had the situation under control and that he did not need to intervene. He was told that there was a strong possibility that a foreign vessel had caused the accident and that Russia should not accept help from foreign powers. Only four months into his tenure as President, Putin was highly criticised by the public and media for his decision to remain at a seaside resort, and his once highly favourable ratings dropped dramatically. The President's response appeared callous and the government's actions looked incompetent.\n\nOn Tuesday, 22 August, 10 days after the sinking, Putin met at 8 p.m. in the Vidyayevo navy base officers' club and cultural centre with about 400–600 angry and grieving residents of the navy base and about 350 family members of the \"Kursk\"s crew. The meeting was closed and access was tightly controlled. Two Russian journalists from \"Nezavisimaya Gazeta\" and \"Kommersant\", who posed as family members, witnessed distraught widows and mothers howling at Putin, demanding to know why they were receiving so much conflicting information and who was going to be punished for the deaths of their family members. They cried:\nThe hostile, contentious meeting lasted for three to six hours. \n\nGerman television channel RTL provided the Russian national daily newspaper \"Kommersant\" with an unedited transcript. The transcript revealed that Putin told the families that Admiral of the Fleet Vladimir Kuroyedov had agreed to accept foreign assistance as soon as it was offered on Wednesday, 16 August, but he was shouted down as soon as he offered this explanation. The family members knew from media reports that foreign assistance had been offered on Monday. Up to this point, family members had received 1,000 (rubles, about USD$37 in 2000) in compensation. Putin also offered the families additional compensation equivalent to ten years' salary, about US$7,000 at the time.\n\nThe Russian state channel RTR was the only media granted access. Their severely edited broadcast of the meeting showed only the president speaking, eliminating the many emotional and contentious encounters between the President and family members. Their single TV camera fed its signal to a satellite truck on loan to RTR from the German TV Company RTL, and RTL recorded the entire event. \n\nDuring the meeting, Nadezhda Tylik, the mother of \"Kursk\" submariner Lt. Sergei Tylik, was extremely emotional and interrupted the meeting. She harangued Putin and Deputy Prime Minister Klebanov, accusing them of lying to the family members. She told them, \"You better shoot yourselves now! We won't let you live, bastards!\" When she would not be quiet, a nurse in civilian apparel behind her forcibly injected her through her clothing with a sedative. She quickly lost the ability to speak and was carried out. Immediately after his wife was given the injection, Tylik's husband said he had asked the nurse to give his wife the drug \"because she was prone to excessive emotions\". Four months later, Nadezhda Tylik said that her husband had lied about the injection to the public to \"save my nerves\" and that he , \"did not ask for help\". Tylik later said, \"The injection was done to shut my mouth. Immediately after it, I just lost the ability to speak and was carried out.\"\n\nThe whole scene was captured by the TV crew, but it was not televised within Russia. Foreign media showed Tylik being removed by officials from the meeting. Tylik later criticised President Putin because he \"did not answer direct questions\" at the meeting. \"Maybe he did not know what to say. But we did not receive concrete answers to concrete questions,\" she said. Tylik told the \"St. Petersburg Times\" that she would go to any lengths to learn the truth about the submarine disaster \"They told us lies the whole time, and even now we are unable to get any information,\" she said.\n\nRussians and observers in the West were shocked by the incident and feared that the public sedation of a crew member's mother meant that the former Soviet Union was returning to Cold War-era methods of silencing dissent. Tylik said that her son had told her six days before the disaster that the submarine had death onboard', but he did not explain what he meant.\" She said, \"I am sure that the commanders of the Northern Fleet knew that the torpedoes were not in order. Those who are guilty must be punished.\" Navy officials in Vidyayevo later confirmed to \"The Times\" and to \"The St. Petersburg Times\" that Tylik was given a sedative. \"We've been giving sedatives to relatives since this began, and it is not such a big deal as you make it out to be in the West,\" said an officer who would not identify himself. \"We are simply protecting the relatives from undue pain – it was for her own protection.\"\n\nJournalist Andrey Kolesnikov, who had been present at Putin's meeting with the families, described his experience in a 2015 documentary titled \"President\". He said when he watched Putin talk to the families, he had never felt such an intense atmosphere of pain and anger in his entire life.\n\nIn response to the avalanche of criticism, Minister of Defence Sergeyev and senior commanders of the Navy and the Northern Fleet offered Putin their resignations, but he refused to accept them.\n\nPutin lashed back at the press, who had been severely critical of his personal response and the entire government's handling of a national tragedy. During the meeting with the crew's relatives, he loudly blamed the oligarchs, who owned most of the country's non-government media, for the poor state of Russia's military. Putin told the family members, \"There are people in television today who ... over the last 10 years destroyed the very army and fleet where people are dying now ... They stole money, they bought the media, and they're manipulating public opinion.\" When relatives asked why the government had waited so long before accepting foreign assistance, Putin said the media had lied. He shouted to the assembled families, \"They're lying. They're lying. They're lying.\" Putin threatened to punish the media owners and counter their influence through alternative \"honest and objective\" media. He scornfully derided their ownership of property abroad. \"They'd better sell their villas on the Mediterranean coast of France or Spain. Then they might have to explain why all this property is registered in false names under front law-firms. Perhaps we would ask them where they got the money.\"\n\nIn a speech to the Russian people the day after his meeting with the families, Putin continued his furious attack on the Russian media, accusing them of lying and discrediting the country. He said they were trying to \"exploit this misfortune ... to gain political capital.\"\n\nOn the same day as Putin's broadcast, Deputy Prime Minister Valentina Matviyenko, head of a special commission, announced that the families of the \"Kursk\" sailors would receive not only 10 years' salary, but free housing in the Russian city of their choice, free college education for their children, and free counselling. With the addition of other donations received from across the world, the families received about US$35,000 in payments.\n\nOn 26 July 2002, almost two years later, the government commission and Russia's Prosecutor General, Vladimir Ustinov, announced that the hydrogen peroxide fuel in the dummy torpedo inside the fourth torpedo launcher set off the initial explosion that sank \"Kursk\".\n\nUstinov released a 133-volume top-secret report in August 2002, two years after the disaster. The government published a four-page summary in \"Rossiyskaya Gazeta\" that revealed \"stunning breaches of discipline, shoddy, obsolete and poorly maintained equipment\", and \"negligence, incompetence, and mismanagement\". The report said the rescue operation was unjustifiably delayed.\n\nThe bulkhead between the first and second compartment was traversed by a circular air conditioning duct. The bulkhead should have arrested the blast wave, but in keeping with common Russian submarine practice, the pressurised valve in the ventilation system that traversed the bulkhead was left open to minimise the change in pressure during a weapon's launch. The initial blast set off a fire that was later estimated to have burned at . The government report concluded that the initial explosion and fire in the torpedo room compartment immediately killed all seven crew members within.\n\nThe open valve in the ventilation system allowed the huge blast wave and possibly the fire and toxic smoke to enter the second and perhaps the third and fourth compartments as well. Although the sub was at periscope depth with her radio antennas extended, no one in the command post was able to send a distress signal or press a single button that would initiate an emergency ballast tank blow and bring the submarine to the surface. All 36 men in the command post located in the second compartment were immediately incapacitated by the blast wave and likely killed.\n\nTwo minutes and 14 seconds after the first explosion in the torpedo compartment, the fire set off a second explosion of 5–7 combat-ready torpedo warheads. Acoustic data from \"Pyotr Velikiy\" was later analysed and found to indicate an explosion of about 7 torpedo warheads in rapid succession. A single Type 65 \"Kit\" torpedo carries a large warhead.\n\nWhile the sub was submerged, 78 crew were normally assigned to the first four compartments and 49 to the rear five compartments. Although \"Kursk\" was designed to withstand external pressure of depths of up to , the second internal explosion tore a hole in the boat's hull, opening the first through fourth compartments to the sea. Water poured in at per second. The explosion collapsed the first three compartments and all of the decks. In addition to the crew in those compartments, there were five officers from 7th SSGN Division Headquarters and two design engineers on board to observe the performance of a new battery in the USET-80 torpedo, set to be launched second. Anyone who remained alive in those compartments was killed by the second explosion.\n\nThe government report confirmed that \"Kursk\" had been sunk by a torpedo explosion caused when high-test peroxide (HTP), a form of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide, leaked from cracks in the torpedo's casing.\n\nHTP is normally stable until it comes in contact with a catalyst. It then expands 5,000 times in volume extremely rapidly, acting as an oxidiser, generating large volumes of steam and oxygen. Ordinarily, the oxygen combines with kerosene fuel in the torpedo engine to propel the missile at higher speed and greater range than conventional torpedoes. Investigators concluded that the leaking HTP had catalytically decomposed when it came in contact with copper commonly found in the bronze and brass used to manufacture \"Kursk\"s torpedo tubes. The resulting overpressure ruptured the torpedo's kerosene fuel tank and caused an explosion that was registered as a weak seismic event on detectors hundreds of kilometres away. Once HTP begins oxidising, it is impossible to stop until the fuel is exhausted.\n\nAnalysis revealed that when the of concentrated high-test peroxide and of kerosene exploded, the internal torpedo tube cover and the external tube door were blown off, opening the torpedo room to the sea. Salvage crews located a piece of the number four torpedo hatch on the seabed behind the main wreckage. Its position, distance, and direction relative to the rest of the submarine indicated that it was deposited there as a result of the first explosion in that tube.\n\nThe fuel in the torpedoes carried by \"Kursk\" was inexpensive and very powerful. Torpedoes using HTP had been in use since the 1950s, but other navies stopped using them because of the danger inherent in their design. sank in 1955, killing 13 sailors, when an experimental torpedo containing HTP exploded as it was being loaded.\n\nAccording to an article that briefly appeared on Thursday 17 August 2000 on the website of the official newspaper of the Russian Defence Ministry, \"Krasnaya Zvezda\", \"Kursk\" had been refitted in 1998—four years after it was commissioned—to carry torpedoes fuelled using the cheap HTP. The article reported that some specialists in the Russian Navy opposed use of the HTP-fuelled torpedoes because they were volatile and dangerous. The story did not appear in the print edition on Friday 18 August. Instead, the article was replaced with another that speculated the submarine had collided with an \"unidentified object\". The change was likely due to political pressure. Vice-premier Ilya Klebanov, chair of the government commission investigating the accident, had a vested interest in suggesting the disaster had been caused by a collision with a NATO vessel. As head of the defence industries, over the objections of some officers, he had promoted use of the liquid-fuelled torpedoes over safer, more-expensive silver-zinc battery-powered torpedoes.\n\nThe government's final report found that the officers who had issued the order approving use of the HTP torpedoes did not have the authority to issue that order. The dummy torpedo was ten years old and some of its parts had exceeded their service life. Several sources said that one of the practice torpedoes had been dropped during transport, possibly leading to a crack in the casing, but that the weapon was put aboard the submarine anyway. The crane that would normally have been used to load the missiles was, as usual, out of order, and another had to be brought in, delaying the loading process. This also made the possibility of removing a damaged torpedo more difficult.\n\nPersonnel who had loaded the practice torpedoes the day before the exercise noticed that the rubber seals were leaking fuel and notified junior officers of the issue, but they took no action because the exercise was so important to the Russian Navy. Even though the leaks on the dummy torpedoes had been detected, the rubber seals were not inspected before the exercise. The crew was also supposed to follow a very strict procedure while preparing the practice HTP torpedo for firing.\n\nMaintenance records revealed that the 65–76 \"Kit\" practice torpedo carried by \"Kursk\" came from a batch of ten manufactured in 1990, six of which were rejected due to faulty welding. An investigation revealed that because the torpedoes were not intended to carry warheads, the welds had not been inspected as carefully as welds on torpedoes carrying warheads. When salvage crews finally recovered the remains of the torpedo and the launch tube, analysis determined that both bore signs of distortion and heat damage that were consistent with an explosion near the middle of the torpedo, very close to an essential welded joint. The official conclusion of the commission was that a faulty weld had led to the explosion.\n\nIn an emergency, personnel in the rear compartments were to move forward to the third compartment along with those in the forward compartments and enter a detachable rescue capsule in the sail (or conning tower), which was capable of evacuating the entire crew. Alternatively, there was also an escape trunk in the first compartment, but the explosion and fire rendered use of it impossible. The rescue capsule in the third compartment was inaccessible, even if it was still usable.\n\nThe fifth compartment that contained the boat's two nuclear reactors was built to withstand larger forces than other interior bulkheads. Like the exterior hull, these bulkheads were designed to withstand pressure up to depths of . The reactors were additionally encased in of steel and resiliently mounted to absorb shocks in excess of 50g. The bulkheads of the fifth compartment withstood both explosions, allowing the two reactors to shut down automatically and prevent a nuclear meltdown and widespread contamination of the sea.\n\nThe fifth compartment contained the nuclear reactors and equipment that automatically recorded the operating activity of the boat. Twenty-two recordings were analysed by specialists from the St. Petersburg Center of Speech Technologies. They discovered that the system had been turned off the day of the accident in violation of procedure.\n\n\"Kursk\" was equipped with an emergency rescue buoy on top of compartment seven that was designed to automatically deploy when it detected any of a variety of emergency conditions like a fire or a rapid pressure change. It was intended to float to the surface and send a signal that would help rescuers locate the stricken vessel. Some reports said that the buoy had repeatedly malfunctioned and had been welded in place. In fact, investigators learned that \"Kursk\" had been deployed to the Mediterranean during the summer of 1999 to monitor the U.S. fleet responding to the Kosovo War. Russian navy officers feared that the buoy might accidentally deploy, revealing the submarine's position to the U.S. fleet. They ordered the buoy to be disabled and it was still inoperative when the sub sank.\n\nDespite the many lapses in procedures and equipment, Ustinov said no charges would be filed because the disaster was caused by a technical malfunction and blame could not be placed on specific individuals. He said that all of the sailors had died within eight hours and none of them could have been rescued in the time available. At a news conference announcing the end of the official inquiry, he absolved the torpedo's manufacturer of any fault. \"Those who designed the torpedo couldn't foresee the possibility of its explosion.\" He also said there was no evidence that the torpedo had been damaged when it was loaded onto \"Kursk\".\n\nWhen Ustinov closed the criminal case without filing charges, family members were angry. Retired Russian navy Captain Vladimir Mityayev lost a son on \"Kursk\". He said, \"To me, this is a clear case of negligence.\" In the end, no one was blamed for the disaster and no one was held responsible.\n\nWhile the official government commission blamed the explosion on a faulty weld in the practice torpedo, Vice-Admiral Valery Ryazantsev cited inadequate training, poor maintenance, and incomplete inspections that caused the crew to mishandle the weapon. The internal tube door was designed to be three times as strong as the external torpedo door, so that any explosion inside the tube would be directed out into the sea. Salvage crews found the internal tube hatch cover embedded in the bulkhead separating the first and second compartments, from the tube. This led investigators to conclude that it was likely that the internal door was not fully closed when the explosion occurred.\n\nIt was known that the electrical connectors between the torpedoes and the internal tube door were unreliable and often required the torpedo crews to open and re-close the door to clean the connection before an electrical contact could be established. \"Kursk\"s crew had not fired a torpedo for three years, and that torpedo was a much simpler battery-powered type. The crew had to complete specific maintenance steps on a regular basis and before firing a torpedo. This included cleaning the torpedo tube of lubricants, metal shavings, and dust that accumulate during long periods of inactivity.\n\nAfter the accident, investigators recovered a partially burned copy of the safety instructions for loading HTP torpedoes, but the instructions were for a significantly different type of torpedo and failed to include essential steps for testing an air valve. The 7th Division, 1st Submarine Flotilla never inspected the \"Kursk\"s crew's qualifications and readiness to fire HTP torpedoes. \"Kursk\"s crew had no prior experience with and had not been trained in handling or firing HTP-powered torpedoes. Ryazantsev believed that due to their inexperience and lack of training, compounded by incomplete inspections and oversight, and because \"Kursk\"s crew followed faulty instructions when loading the practice torpedo, they set off a chain of events that led to the explosion. Ryazantsev asserted that signatures on the records documenting that the sailors had been trained in handling and firing HTP torpedoes had been faked. He stated that the warhead fuses on combat torpedoes 1, 3, 5, and 6 were set off when the first compartment collapsed after striking the sea bottom.\n\nThe \"Komsomolskaya Pravda\" tabloid published a report in June 2001 that senior officers in the Russian Navy had engaged in an elaborate deception to cover the actual cause of the disaster. This referred to statements that the boat's captain, Gennady Lyachin, had sent a message to headquarters immediately prior to the explosion, \"We have a malfunctioning torpedo. Request permission to fire it,\" though it is unlikely that, as captain of the vessel, he would have needed to request permission under such circumstances.\n\nThe Russian Navy was later criticised as misrepresenting facts and misleading the public. The navy feared that if it was revealed that the submarine blew up because of crew incompetence, Russia's status as a great power would be in doubt. Their response was compared to the Soviet style of cover up and stonewalling like that during the Chernobyl disaster. Minister of Defence Sergeyev said in interviews on 21 March 2000, that he had never refused any foreign help.\n\n\"The Guardian\" wrote in a 2002 review of two books, \"Kursk, Russia's Lost Pride\" and \"A Time to Die: The Kursk Disaster\":\nWhile most experts agreed that a torpedo had exploded, they differed on what caused the explosion. Many Russians did not believe that \"Kursk\" could be so easily sunk. The tragedy spawned a number of wild conspiracy theories to explain the disaster. One theory offered was an explosion located in the high-pressure air tanks used to blow the ballast tanks, located near the torpedo tubes. Mainstream publications like \"Der Spiegel\", \"Berliner Zeitung\", and the \"Sunday Times\" claimed to possess documentation proving that the submarine was struck by a missile fired by \"Pyotr Velikiy\". This was the largest naval exercise that the Russian navy had conducted in more than a decade, which increased the chances of a friendly fire incident. Other theories included Chechen espionage, human error, sabotage, and that \"Kursk\" was testing a new top-secret torpedo, Shkval (Squall), capable of speeds in excess of . Another theory was that USS \"Memphis\" had fired a torpedo at \"Kursk\".\n\nThe director of the that designed the torpedo, Stanislav Proshkin, challenged the conclusion of the government's official report. He said the weapon could have exploded only after an external event like a fire. He said that the torpedoes are routinely tested during manufacturing and are dropped from a height of without causing damage that could lead to an explosion. He also said \"Kursk\" was designed with two autonomous, independent control systems that would have detected a rise in temperature while the torpedo was stored on the racks. The sub was equipped with a special drain system that could rapidly drain hydrogen peroxide fuel from a torpedo into the sea. If a temperature rise was detected in the torpedo tube, the torpedo would have automatically been ejected into the sea. In addition, any fire in the torpedo compartment would have triggered a powerful fire-extinguishing system that would have dumped \"tons of water\" on the fire.\n\nThe Russian government committed to raising the wreck and recovering the crew's remains in a US$65M salvage operation. They contracted with the Dutch marine salvage companies Smit International and Mammoet to raise \"Kursk\" from the sea floor. It became the largest salvage operation of its type ever accomplished. The salvage operation was extremely dangerous because of the risk of radiation from the reactor. Only seven of the submarine's 24 torpedoes were accounted for.\n\nSalvage divers from Halliburton first detached the bow from the rest of the vessel because it might have contained unexploded torpedo warheads and because it could break off and destabilise the lifting. The divers installed two large hydraulic suction anchors into the seabed and attached a high-strength tungsten carbide abrasive saw that was pulled back and forth over the bow between the anchors. It took ten days to detach the bow.\n\nAfter the bow was cut free, the salvage crews raised several smaller pieces of wreckage. This included a piece of a torpedo tube weighing about a ton which was analysed to try to learn if the explosion occurred inside or outside the tube. They salvaged a high-pressure compressed air cylinder weighing about half a ton, to learn more about the nature of the explosion. They also raised a part of the cylindrical section of the hard frame and part of the left forward spherical partition, to determine the intensity and temperature of the fire in the forward compartment. Finally, they brought up a fragment of the sonar system dome.\n\nMammoet converted the , long, \"Giant 4\" semi-submersible deck barge to carry the sub. The ship was designed to carry huge loads on its deck, but \"Kursk\" would ride beneath the ship. \"Giant 4\" had to be completely modified to retrieve and carry the sub underneath. To raise the remainder of the boat, the salvage team planned an extremely complex operation that required them to design and build custom lifting equipment and employ new technologies. They wrote custom software that would automatically compensate for the effects of wave motion due to the rough Barents Sea, which could sever the cables suspending the sub beneath the barge.\n\nDivers cut a large hole in the barge's hull to allow room for the submarine's sail. Workers fitted the hull of \"Giant 4\" with large saddles shaped to fit \"Kursk\"s outer hull. They cut holes through the barge to allow 26 hoisting cables to pass through. The team manufactured 26 giant cable reels to hold the more than of cable to be used to raise the boat. The giant cable reels fed 26 huge hydraulic strand jacks, each mounted on a computer-controlled, pressurised pneumatic heave compensator powered by nitrogen gas that automatically adjusted for sea waves. \"Giant 4\" was held in position over the submarine by an eight-point mooring system from four twin-drum winches on the main deck.\n\n\"Mayo\", a diving platform, was equipped with dive chambers to accommodate the dive teams. They worked in six-hour shifts, and when they were not in the water, the divers remained in the saturation chambers for the entire 28 days the operation took. The divers used hydraulic abrasive water jets to cut 26 holes through both the outer and inner hulls. The salvage divers mounted custom guidance rings around the holes in the sub and lowered guide cables to each through the holes in \"Giant 4\". The team then used the four guide cables to lower a custom-made giant gripper, similar to a toggle bolt, which were custom designed to fit each hole, and the divers manoeuvred them through the guidance ring.\n\nThe crew lowered 26 groups of hoisting cables, each capable of lifting 900 tons, to the submarine and attached them to the grippers. The strand jacks lifted the 26 hoisting cables and slowly raised \"Kursk\" until it was beneath \"Giant 4\". On 8 October 2001, fourteen months after the disaster, and only five months after the contract had been awarded to them, the salvage team raised the remainder of the ship in a 15-hour operation.\n\nOnce the sub was raised and joined to the barge, it was carried back under the barge to the Russian Navy's Roslyakovo Shipyard in Murmansk. Once there, two giant, custom-manufactured pontoons were floated under \"Giant 4\" to lift the barge to allow it to enter a floating dry dock with \"Kursk\" attached underneath. Once in the dry dock, the pontoons were pumped full of more air, lifting \"Giant 4\" and allowing crews to remove the lifting cables and detach \"Kursk\".\n\nThe Russians initially intended to raise the bow from the sea floor—possibly containing undetonated torpedoes—but then decided it was too risky. Some analysts theorised the Russians may also have wanted to prevent foreign countries from accessing the debris which had been classified as state secrets. They decided to destroy what was left of the bow where it lay and blew up the remnants in September 2002.\n\nThere were 24 men assigned to compartments six through nine towards the rear of the boat. Of that number, 23 survived the two blasts and gathered in the small ninth compartment, which had an escape hatch. Captain-lieutenant Dmitri Kolesnikov, head of the turbine unit in the seventh department, and one of three surviving officers of that rank, apparently took charge. Emergency lighting was normally powered by batteries located in the first compartment, but these had been destroyed in the explosion. But the ninth compartment contained a number of independent emergency lights, which apparently worked.\n\nKolesnikov wrote two notes, parts of which were released by Vice Admiral Motsak to the media for the first time on 27 October 2000. The first, written at 13:15, 1 hour and 45 minutes after the second explosion, contained a private note to his family and, on the reverse, information on their situation and the names of those in the ninth compartment. The handwriting appears normal, indicating the sailors still had some light.\n\nKolesnikov wrote the second note at 15:15. His writing was extremely difficult to read.\n\nThe newspaper \"Izvestia\" reported on 26 February 2001 that another note, written by Lt. Cmdr. Rashid Aryapov, had been recovered during the initial rescue operation. Aryapov held a senior position in the sixth compartment. The note was written on the page of a detective novel and wrapped in plastic. It was found in a pocket of his clothing after his body was recovered.\n\n\"Izvestia\" quoted unidentified naval officers who claimed that Aryapov wrote that the explosion was caused by \"faults in the torpedo compartment, namely, the explosion of a torpedo on which the Kursk had to carry out tests\". \"Izvestia\" also stated that Aryapov wrote that as a result of the explosions the submarine was tossed violently about, and many crew members were injured by equipment that tore loose as a result. To the Russian public, it appeared that the Russian Navy was covering up its inability to rescue the trapped sailors.\n\nAnalysis of the wreck could not determine whether the escape hatch was workable from the inside. Analysts theorise that the men may have rejected risking the escape hatch even if it were operable, and would have preferred to wait for a submarine rescue ship to attach itself to the hatch. The sub was relatively close to shore and in the middle of a large naval exercise. The sailors had every reason to believe that rescue would arrive quickly. Using the escape trunk was risky. The sailors were in a compartment that was initially at surface atmosphere pressure, so they did not risk decompression sickness ('the bends') if they used the rescue hoods to ascend to the surface. But the Arctic water was extremely cold and they could not survive long in the water. Also, water was slowly seeping into the ninth compartment, increasing the atmospheric pressure and thus the risk of decompression sickness and death when they ascended to the surface. In addition it was likely that some of the men were seriously injured and escape would have been very difficult for them.\n\nWhen the nuclear reactors automatically shut down, the air purification system would have shut down, emergency power would be limited, and the crew would soon have been in complete darkness and experienced falling temperatures.\n\nThere was considerable debate over how long the sailors in the ninth compartment had survived. Russian military officers initially gave conflicting accounts, that survivors could have lived up to a week within the sub, but those that died would have been killed very quickly. The Dutch recovery team reported that they thought the men in the least affected ninth compartment might have survived for two to three hours. But the level of carbon dioxide in the compartment exceeded that which people can produce in a closed space. Divers found ash and dust inside the compartment when they first opened that hatch, evidence of a fire. But this fire was separate from that caused by the exploding torpedo.\n\nCaptain-Lieutenant Kolesnikov, evidently the senior officer in the compartment, wrote a final note at 15:15 in the dark, giving evidence that he was alive at least four hours after the explosion. Other notes recovered later show that some sailors in the ninth compartment were alive at least 6 hours and 17 minutes after the boat sank. Vice Admiral Vladislav Ilyin, first deputy chief of the Russian Navy's staff and head of the \"Kursk\" Naval Incident Cell, concluded that the survivors had lived up to three days.\n\nIn any event, the Russian rescue teams were poorly equipped and badly organised, while foreign teams and equipment were far away and not given permission to assist. It is unlikely that any rescue by either Russian or foreign specialists could have arrived and reached the sub in time to rescue any survivors.\n\nWhile waiting for the boat to be brought to shore, a team of military doctors set up a temporary forensic laboratory at the military hospital in Severomorsk. After \"Giant 4\" was floated out of the drydock, water was drained from the drydock, exposing the \"Kursk's\" hull. Salvage teams cut into the compartments to drain water from the interior. Ordnance teams removed the Granit cruise missiles and Stallion anti-ship missiles from outside the hull. On 23 October, two investigators and two navy commanders were the first to enter the hull. The next day, 24 October, eight teams of investigators and operational experts began analysing the debris found inside the boat and recovering and identifying remains of the crew. Working from a database of personal identification details, including the crew members' features, dental x-rays, birth marks, and tattoos, the doctors examined the bodies as they were brought to the laboratory.\n\nSalvage team members found a large number of potassium superoxide chemical cartridges, used to absorb carbon dioxide and chemically release oxygen to enable survival, in the ninth compartment. Autopsies of the crew recovered from the ninth compartment showed that three men suffered from thermal and chemical burns. Researchers concluded Captain-Lieutenant Kolesnikov and two others had attempted to recharge the oxygen generation system when they accidentally dropped one of the chemical superoxide cartridges into the sea water slowly filling the compartment. When the cartridge came in contact with the oily sea water, it triggered a chemical explosion and flash fire. Kolesnikov's abdomen was burned by acid, exposing the internal organs, and the flesh on his head and neck were removed by the chemical explosion.\n\nThe investigation showed that some men temporarily survived this fire by plunging under water, as fire marks on the bulkheads indicated the water was at waist level at the time. But the flash fire consumed all remaining oxygen, so that the men still alive after the flash explosion quickly died of carbon monoxide poisoning. Water continued to seep into the compartment, and by the time rescue divers opened the compartment, they found only a small air pocket containing just 7% oxygen.\n\nBodies recovered from the ninth compartment were relatively easy to identify. Those recovered from the third, fourth, and fifth compartments were badly damaged by the explosion. Forensic examination of two of the reactor control room casualties found in compartment four showed extensive skeletal injuries which indicated that they had sustained an explosive force of over 50g. These shocks would have immediately incapacitated or killed the operators. One sailor's body was found embedded in the ceiling of the second compartment. Three crewmen's bodies were completely destroyed by the blast and fire and nothing of their remains could be identified or recovered.\n\nThe sinking of the ship, the pride of their submarine fleet, was a devastating blow to the Russian military. The \"Kursk\"s participation in the exercise had been intended to demonstrate Russia's place as an important player on the international stage, but the country's inept handling of the crisis instead exposed its weak political decision-making ability and the decline of its military. \n\nA year later Putin commented on his response, \"I probably should have returned to Moscow, but nothing would have changed. I had the same level of communication both in Sochi and in Moscow, but from a PR point of view I could have demonstrated some special eagerness to return.\"\n\nOnce the human remains had been removed and the hull had been thoroughly investigated, the remainder of the ship was transported to Sayda Bay on the northern Kayla Peninsula. The two nuclear reactors were defuelled and the ship was cut up for scrap.\n\nFinally recognising the hazard of the HTP-fuelled torpedoes, the Russian Navy ordered all of them to be removed from service.\n\nPutin accepted the resignation of Igor Sergeyev from his position as Minister of Defence on 28 March 2001 and made him his assistant on strategic stability. He replaced him with Sergei Ivanov, who had previously been secretary of the Security Council of Russia. The position of Minister of Defence had always been filled by a professional member of the military. Ivanov had retired from the military in 2000, so his appointment as Minister of Defence while a civilian shocked the Russian military.\n\nOn 1 December 2001, Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov presented a preliminary report to Putin. Ustinov wrote that the entire exercise had been \"poorly organized\" and that the probe had revealed \"serious violations by both Northern Fleet chiefs and the \"Kursk\" crew.\" Shortly afterward, Putin transferred the Northern Fleet commander, Vyacheslav Popov, and his chief of staff, Admiral Mikhail Motsak. As is common in such circumstances, both soon obtained jobs elsewhere in the government. Popov became a representative for the Murmansk region in the Federation Council, and Motsak became deputy presidential envoy for the North-Western Federal District. Popov and Motsak had championed the story that the accident had been caused by a collision with a NATO submarine. When Putin dismissed them, he made a point of repudiating the collision theory. In another example of a lateral transfer, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov had been an outspoken advocate of the theory that the \"Kursk\" had collided with a foreign submarine. He had also been in charge of the rescue operation and follow-up inquiry. In February 2002, Putin removed him from his position as Deputy Prime Minister and made him Minister of Industry, Science, and Technology.\n\nPutin dismissed the Northern Fleet's submarine commander, Vice Admiral Oleg Burtsev, and in total removed 12 high-ranking officers in charge of the Northern Fleet. Paradoxically, he said their dismissal had nothing to do with the \"Kursk\" disaster, but that they had been responsible for \"serious flaws in the organizations of the service.\" However, all 12 had been involved with the exercise, the rescue operations, or the submarine itself. All were transferred to equal positions elsewhere in the government or in the business sector.\n\nAs a result of the disaster, Russia began participating in NATO search and rescue exercises in 2011. It was the first time a Russian submarine had taken part in a NATO-led exercise. The Russian Navy also increased the number of deep-sea divers trained each year from 18–20 to 40–45.\n\nPresident Putin signed a decree awarding the Order of Courage to the entire crew, and the title Hero of the Russian Federation to the submarine's captain, Gennady Lyachin.\n\nOutside the port city of Severodvinsk where the submarine was built, a large granite slab was erected on the sand dunes. It is engraved, \"This sorrowful stone is set in memory of the crew of the nuclear submarine \"Kursk\", who tragically died on 12 August 2000, while on military duty.\" Other memorials were built in Moscow, Sevastopol, Nizhny Novgorod, and Severomorsk. A memorial was erected in Serafimovskoe Cemetery in St. Petersburg, where 32 of the sailors were buried. The city of Kursk, for which the vessel was named, erected a memorial made from fragments of its hull.\n\nOn 17 March 2009, journalist Tatyana Abramova from the newspaper \"Murmanskiy Vestnik\" found \"Kursk\"s sail in the yard of a scrap metal dealer. It had been left there after several years of negotiations had failed to raise the estimated €22,000 for a memorial. The discovery sparked an outcry among citizens in Murmansk and they demanded it be turned into a memorial to the men who died. After considerable difficulty, the memorial was finally completed and dedicated on Sunday, 26 July 2009, Russia's Navy Day. It was placed on the observation deck of the Church of the Saviour on Water in Murmansk, the submarine's home port and location of the Vidyayevo naval base. It is among a memorial to sailors who perished during peacetime. It lists the names of the crew members.\n\nOn 31 July 2012, divers representing the relatives of \"Kursk\"s crew and the Northern Fleet command placed an Orthodox cross on the floor of the Barents Sea at the site of the disaster.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2097334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097334", "title": "Systemic primary carnitine deficiency", "text": "Systemic primary carnitine deficiency\n\nSystemic primary carnitine deficiency (SPCD) is an inborn error of fatty acid transport caused by a defect in the transporter responsible for moving carnitine across the plasma membrane. Carnitine is an important amino acid for fatty acid metabolism. When carnitine cannot be transported into tissues, fatty acid oxidation is impaired, leading to a variety of symptoms such as chronic muscle weakness, cardiomyopathy, hypoglycemia and liver dysfunction. The specific transporter involved with SPCD is OCTN2, coded for by the \"SLC22A5\" gene located on chromosome 5. SPCD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, with mutated alleles coming from both parents.\n\nAcute episodes due to SPCD are often preceded by metabolic stress such as extended fasting, infections or vomiting. Cardiomyopathy can develop in the absence of an acute episode, and can result in death. SPCD leads to increased carnitine excretion in the urine and low levels in plasma. In most locations with expanded newborn screening, SPCD can be identified and treated shortly after birth. Treatment with high doses of carnitine supplementation is effective, but needs to be rigorously maintained for life.\n\nSPCD is more common in the Faroe Islands than in other countries; at least one out of every 1000 inhabitants of the Faroes has the illness, while the numbers for other countries are one in every 100,000. Around 100 persons in the islands have been diagnosed, around one third of the whole population of 48,000 people have been screened for SPCD. Several young Faroese people and children have died a sudden death with cardiac arrest because of SPCD. Scientists believe that around 10% of the Faroese population are carriers of variants which cause SPCD. These people are not ill, but may have a lower amount of carnitine in their blood than non-carriers.\n\nThe presentation of patient with SPCD can be incredibly varied, from asymptomatic to lethal cardiac manifestations. Early cases were reported with liver dysfunction, muscular findings (weakness and underdevelopment), hypoketotic hypoglycemia, cardiomegaly, cardiomyopathy and marked carnitine deficiency in plasma and tissues, combined with increased excretion in urine. Patients who present clinically with SPCD fall into two categories, a metabolic presentation with hypoglycemia and a cardiac presentation characterized by cardiomyopathy. Muscle weakness can be found with either presentation.\n\nIn countries with expanded newborn screening, SPCD can be identified shortly after birth. Affected infants show low levels of free carnitine and all other acylcarnitine species by tandem mass spectrometry. Not all infants with low free carnitine are affected with SPCD. Some may have carnitine deficiency secondary to another metabolic condition or due to maternal carnitine deficiency. Proper follow-up of newborn screening results for low free carnitine includes studies of the mother to determine whether her carnitine deficiency is due to SPCD or secondary to a metabolic disease or diet. Maternal cases of SPCD have been identified at a higher than expected rate, often in women who are asymptomatic. Some mothers have also been identified through newborn screening with cardiomyopathy that had not been previously diagnosed. The identification and treatment of these asymptomatic individuals is still developing, as it is not clear whether they require the same levels of intervention as patients identified with SPCD early in life based on clinical presentation.\n\nSPCD is an autosomal recessive condition, meaning a mutated allele must be inherited from each parent for an individual to be affected. The gene responsible for the OCTN2 carnitine transporter is \"SLC22A5\", located at 5q31.1-32. \"SLC22A5\" is regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha. The transporter, OCTN2, is located in the apical membrane of the renal tubular cells, where it plays a role in tubular reabsorption.\n\nThe defective OCTN2 is unable to recapture carnitine prior to its excretion in urine, leading to the characteristic biochemical findings of massively increased urine carnitine levels and significantly decreased plasma carnitine levels. Decreased levels of plasma carnitine inhibit fatty acid oxidation during times of excessive energy demand. Carnitine is needed to transport long chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they can be broken down to produce acetyl-CoA. Individuals with SPCD cannot produce ketone bodies as energy due to the interruption of fatty acid oxidation. Although SPCD is an autosomal recessive condition, heterozygotes have been shown to be at an increased risk for developing benign cardiomyopathy compared to wild type individuals.\n\nThe first suspicion of SPCD in a patient with a non-specific presentation is an extremely low plasma carnitine level. When combined with an increased concentration of carnitine in urine, the suspicion of SPCD can often be confirmed by either molecular testing or functional studies assessing the uptake of carnitine in cultured fibroblasts.\n\nIdentification of patients presymptomatically via newborn screening has allowed early intervention and treatment. Treatment for SPCD involves high dose carnitine supplementation, which must be continued for life. Individuals who are identified and treated at birth have very good outcomes, including the prevention of cardiomyopathy. Mothers who are identified after a positive newborn screen but are otherwise asymptomatic are typically offered carnitine supplementation as well. The long-term outcomes for asymptomatic adults with SPCD is not known, but the discovery of mothers with undiagnosed cardiomyopathy and SPCD has raised the possibility that identification and treatment may prevent adult-onset manifestations.\n\nThe addition of SPCD to newborn screening panels has offered insight into the incidence of the disorder around the world. In Taiwan, the incidence of SPCD in newborns was estimated to be approximately 1:67,000, while maternal cases were identified at a higher frequency of approximately 1:33,000. The increased incidence of SPCD in mothers compared to newborns is not completely understood. Estimates of SPCD in Japan have shown a similar incidence of 1:40,000. Worldwide, SPCD has the highest incidence in the relatively genetically isolated Faroe Islands, where an extensive screening program was instituted after the sudden death of two teenagers. The incidence in the Faroe Islands is approximately 1:200.\n\nCarnitine deficiency has been extensively studied, although most commonly as a secondary finding to other metabolic conditions. The first case of SPCD was reported in the 1980s, in a child with fasting hypoketotic hypoglycemia that resolved after treatment with carnitine supplementation. Later cases were reported with cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness. Newborn screening expanded the potential phenotypes associated with SPCD, to include otherwise asymptomatic adults.\n\n"}

Tracy Venable, a journalist from Los Angeles, is working on an article about serial killers being released. She believes that Norman is killing again, so when Norman appears at the diner, Tracy attempts to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives, Norman opens up to her but is distracted when Maureen Coyle, a young, mentally unstable former nun, enters. He is startled because she resembles his former victim, Marion Crane. Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman panics and leaves the diner.\n\n\"Mother\" enters Maureen's bathroom later that night, intending to kill her, only to find that Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists. The shock of this causes Norman to reassert his personality while a delirious Maureen mistakes \"Mother\" holding a knife for the Virgin Mary holding a silver crucifix. Norman brings Maureen to a hospital and offers that she stay as long as she needs to. After she is released, they begin a romantic relationship. Later that night, Duane picks up a girl named Red at a bar, but after Red makes it clear that she wants more than just a fling, Duane throws her out. Red tries to call a cab, but \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs Red to death. The following day, tourists arrive at the motel, where they plan to watch a local football game. Meanwhile, Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's phone number written on a magazine cover repeatedly.\n\nPatsy Boyle, the only sober guest, is murdered by \"Mother\". Norman discovers Patsy's body and buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office. The next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Tracy tells Maureen about Norman's past, causing Maureen to stay with Father Brian, who took care of her at the hospital. Norman finds that Spool's corpse is missing and finds a note stating that she is in Cabin 12. Duane demands a large sum of money to keep quiet or else he will turn Norman over to the police. They fight and Norman beats Duane with his guitar until he loses consciousness. Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane then regains consciousness and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives into the swamp. Norman escapes the car while Duane drowns. Meanwhile, Tracy talks to Statler and Myrna about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also been institutionalized for murder.\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love and returns to the motel. Norman and Maureen share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, startling him. He loses his grip on Maureen's hands, causing her to fall down the stairs, killing her. Enraged, Norman promises \"Mother\" that he will get her for this. Tracy enters the house and finds Maureen dead, then sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\" bearing a knife, but is unable to flee. She tries reasoning with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool was his aunt and was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma. Mrs. Spool kidnapped Norman when he was a child, after killing Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him\". When she was caught, Norman was returned to Norma while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. Tracy discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom. Norman takes off his dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, but when Norman raises the knife, he attacks \"Mother\" instead, dismembering Mrs. Spool's corpse. Sheriff Hunt takes Norman to his squad car. Hunt informs Norman that they may never release him from the institution again. Norman replies: \"But I'll be free...I'll finally be free.\" In the back of the squad car, Norman caresses a trophy he concealed: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He strokes the hand and smiles.\n\n\nCarter Burwell was approached by Perkins to compose the score to the film, since Perkins had enjoyed Burwell's work on \"Blood Simple\". Perkins stated that he wanted to take the score in a more contemporary direction than Jerry Goldsmith had for his more traditional score for \"Psycho II\". Burwell flew to Los Angeles and recorded the score largely on a Synclavier electronic music station, augmented by women's and boys' choirs as well as percussion by Steve Forman.\n\nAfter Universal suggested the film contain some pop songs so that the film could be marketable to the MTV generation, Burwell composed and performed songs with colleagues Stanton Miranda and Steve Bray. After Universal claimed the songs weren't sufficiently bankable, Burwell attempted to create a song with Oingo Boingo frontman and then burgeoning film composer Danny Elfman, using sampled strings from Bernard Herrmann's score to the original \"Psycho\". This idea was also rejected.\n\nUniversal finally agreed to let Burwell take a motif from the score he'd composed and develop it into an instrumental electronic pop song. The song, \"Scream of Love\"—co-written by jazz saxophonist David Sanborn—was released as a 7\" single and a series of dance remixes were commissioned from Arthur Baker and featured on the 12\" version. MCA also commissioned a music video for the song featuring Burwell, Perkins and a \"Hitchcockian woman.\" Perkins introduced the video on MTV as a guest VJ on July 2, 1986. The rest of the songs composed by Burwell, Miranda and Bray were used as background music in the film, playing from car stereos and jukeboxes.\n\nBurwell's score was sampled by the hip hop group Insane Poetry on \"Welcome to the Grim Side\", the intro to their 1992 debut album \"Grim Reality\", as well as on British musician Aim's 1999 electronica album, Cold Water Music.\n\nWhen the film opened on July 2, 1986, it earned $3.2 million in its opening weekend and went on to gross $14.4 million at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the \"Psycho\" series.\n\nReviews from critics were mixed. Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" wrote a generally positive review, calling Perkins a \"very creditable director\" and Pogue's screenplay \"efficient,\" concluding that \"'Psycho III' expresses its appreciation of the Hitchcock legacy without seeming to rip it off.\" \"Variety\" wrote that the film \"has its moments—about 20 minutes' worth—but the rest is filler in which the filmmakers gamely but futilely try to breathe new life into a tired body.\" Michael Wilmington of the \"Los Angeles Times\" thought that the film was \"better in most respects than 'II',\" but \"it fails any sequel's acid test. It feeds off the original without deepening it.\" He added that \"if the movie proves anything, it's that everyone should give Hitchcock a rest.\" Paul Attanasio of \"The Washington Post\" called it \"a playful, artfully made horror movie\" made \"really fun\" by \"Perkins and Pogue's morbid humor, the way they've captured the Hitchcock spirit and made it their own.\" Tom Milne of \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" wrote that Perkins gave \"an excellent performance\" but \"there isn't very much more to be said about Norman Bates.\"\nGene Siskel and Roger Ebert were split on the film's effectiveness. On their television show \"At the Movies\", Ebert gave the film a \"thumbs up\" positive appraisal, saying it was a \"much better movie than part two,\" and adding, \"in his first directing effort, Perkins shows that he knows Norman better than anyone else.\" Siskel, however, gave the film a \"thumbs down\" negative rating, reasoning that he was \"turned off by some of the violence\" and that the film \"just sort of laid there.\"\n\nAs of December 2019, the film holds a 58% approval rating based on 19 reviews on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 5.2/10.\n\"Psycho III\" has been released four times on DVD. The initial release came in 1999 when Universal Studios leased the film out to GoodTimes Home Video. The second release came in 2005 from Universal Studios itself. The third release came in 2007 as part of a triple feature package with \"Psycho II\" and \"\".\nOn September 24, 2013, Shout Factory released a special edition on DVD and Blu-ray.\n\n"}

He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1971 to 1985 representing the riding of Scarborough Centre. He served as a cabinet minister in the government of Premier Bill Davis.\n\nDrea was born in St. Catharines, Ontario, and educated at Canisius College in Buffalo, New York. He was hired by the Toronto Telegram in 1955, and was a long-time reporter and columnist at the paper. In 1961, he won the \"National Newspaper Award\" and the \"Heywood Broun Award\" for Crusading Journalism for his work as a labour reporter for his coverage of a strike by Italian-Canadian building trade workers.\n\nFrom 1963 to 1965, he worked as public relations director for the United Steel Workers of America in Sudbury, Ontario. A fervent anti-Communist, Drea played a leading role in the Steelworkers' unsuccessful campaign to raid and destroy the Communist Party influenced Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers Union which had dominated the mining industry in Sudbury. Drea's campaign was a failure, and he was fired.\n\nHe returned to the Telegram in 1965 as the paper's \"Action Line\" columnist, serving as an early consumer advocate. He remained with the newspaper until shortly before its demise in 1971. He also served with Dale Goldhawk as an outspoken, open-line host at CHIC Radio in Brampton, Ontario and worked for CTV on the public affairs program W5.\n\nDrea was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1971 provincial election as the Progressive Conservative Member of Provincial Parliament for Scarborough Centre. He defeated incumbent New Democrat Margaret Renwick by 4,873 votes. Drea was re-elected with smaller pluralities in the 1975 and 1977 elections, and by a larger percentage in 1981.\n\nAfter serving for several years on the backbench, he was brought into the provincial cabinet of Bill Davis following the 1977 provincial election as Minister of Correctional Services. He initiated reforms in the province's system of jails, including the closure of the original Don Jail. On entering cabinet, Drea publicly revealed his battle with alcoholism, pledging to stop drinking in order to set an example for prisoners.\n\nIn 1978, he was appointed Minister of Consumer and Commercial Relations. After the 1981 provincial election, he became Minister of Community and Social Services, and is credited with improving the status of people with disabilities. In September 1983 he was hospitalized with circulation problems. He briefly gave up his cabinet position from September 29, 1983 to November 21, 1983. Citizenship and Culture minister Bruce McCaffrey was named to act in his place during this time.\n\nHe served in cabinet until Bill Davis retired as Premier of Ontario in 1985. Drea supported Roy McMurtry's bid to succeed Davis as party leader, and voted for Larry Grossman on the second ballot following McMurtry's elimination. He supported Frank Miller over Grossman on the third and final ballot. Drea explained that he had planned to support Miller after McMurtry's elimination, and only went to Grossman for one ballot on McMurtry's recommendation. He was not re-appointed to Miller's cabinet and instead served as parliamentary assistant to the premier. Drea was disappointed at being dropped from cabinet and decided not to run in the 1985 election. He said, \"I'm not wanted so, I won't be running.\" He reflected on his time in politics. \"I'm happy,\" he said. \"I've had 14 marvellous years with Mr. Davis ... the greatest living Canadian.\"\n\nDrea was appointed to the Ontario Municipal Board by Miller in May 1985. His tenure there was short as Miller's successor, Liberal Premier David Peterson, appointed Drea as chairman of the Ontario Racing Commission four month later. Drea remained chairman until 1994 when Bob Rae's NDP government decided not to reappoint him. He would not speculate on the reason for dropping him from the position. \"I don't know why they're doing it,\" he shrugged. \"It's like ball players. You get hired. You get fired.\" During his tenure as chairman he introduced teletheatres for simulcasting races across the province and was responsible for saving racetrack operations in Windsor, Elmira and Sudbury. He died on January 15, 2003 from pneumonia.\n"}

It is about 7 kilometres (4 miles) south of Sligo town. The town developed on an important crossing of the Owenmore River.\n\nThe Ox Mountains () are located west of the town. The town itself is named after the falls on the Owenmore River. Ballysadare is in the barony of Leyny formerly the \"túath\" of Luighne Connacht, and the barony of Tirerril, formerly the túath of Tír Olloíl. The Owenmore river forms the border between the baronies. Ballysadare also borders two other baronies in Co. Sligo, Carbury to the North and Tireragh to the West. Ballysadare is in the diocese of Achonry.\n\nAlternative names for the falls are \"Ess Mac Modairn\" (Falls of the son of Modairn) and \"Ess na n-Éan\" (The Falls of the Bird).\n\nThere appear to be three variants of English version of the settlement name still in use, \"Ballysadare\" being on the road signs coming to dominate. The use of \"Ballisodare\" remains in evidence on the names of some local sport clubs and even on at least one Sligo County Council document in 2018. \"Ballysodare\" appears to been used for the railway station and there is evidence of its use on a map of 1887 and indexing of parish registers at the National Library of Ireland.\n\nBallysadare is a possible location for the town noted as Nagnata on Claudius Ptolemy's 2nd century CE co-ordinate map of the world. Ballysadare was anciently a major gathering place for all surrounding districts.\n\nSt. Columba visited Ballysadare in 575 AD at which \"\"Before the Saint (Columba) returned to Britain he founded one church in the district of Carbury, and proceeded from thence to a place called Easdara, where all the prelates of the neighbouring regions, and vast numbers of holy men and women had come to meet him ; and, to say nothing of the rest of the multitude, which was almost beyond counting, a great many distinguished saints of the race of Cumne are recorded to have been present.\"\" This extract is from Colgans Acta Sanctorum Hiberniae.\n\nThe O'Hara were the lords of Lúighne.\n\nSt Féichín was born in the townland of Billa in the parish of Ballysadare. He is said to have studied under St. Nath Í of Achonry further to the south in the same territory. The word Bile means a sacred tree or grove. The townland is the location of the Leaba St. Féichín or St. Feichins bed. The town developed near a church founded by St. Féichín, some time before he died in 664 AD (O’Rorke 1878, 1-4).This monastic site is in Kilboglashy townland and the remains consist of a stone church known as the Great Temple of St. Féichín (Teampal mór Féichín), with a later Romanesque style carved doorway, two small buildings and a graveyard.

There is also a hydro electric power station in the vicinity.\n\nThe area experienced rapid development during the 'Celtic Tiger' boom, with the population more than doubling in the 20 years between the 1996 and 2016 census (from 612 to 1,350 people). During this period several new housing estates were developed, several of which subsequently remained empty, creating phantom estates.

It lies on the N15 national route at its junction with the R279. It is only three kilometres away from Mullaghmore which is popular with surfers. \n\nCliffoney has historical connections to Lord Palmerston, British Prime Minister and Father Michael O'Flanagan, Vice-President and later President of Sinn Féin, who was known as the Republican Priest. Brigid MacGonigal, mother of Harry Clarke, was a native of Cliffoney. \n\nThere are several megalithic monuments close to the village, including Creevykeel Court Tomb. There are also several ringforts and cashels in the area. Saint Brigit's cross-slab, possibly dating to the eight century, has a swastika carved in the top of the cross.\n\nThe oldest buildings in Cliffoney are the five megalithic tombs close to the village in the townlands of Creevykeel, Creevymore and Cartronplank. Creevykeel, considered one of the finest examples of its kind in Ireland, was excavated by the Harvard Archaeological Mission in 1935. A second monument close to Creevykeel was destroyed completely by 1890. The chamber and back-stone of Cartronplank court tomb still survives, located on a private farm. The other two monuments are overgrown and on private land.\n\nThe Cliffoney megaliths were visited by many antiquarians and researchers, and were illustrated by William Wakeman in 1880. Creevykeel is in state care and is maintained by the Office of Public Works. The other sites are on private property.\n\nSaint Bridget's well is located on private land close to the village of Cliffoney. The well is located within a large ringfort some 40 meters in diameter which is mostly ploughed out on the south side, but is in good condition on the north side. Beside the well is an early Christian cross slab known as the Cliffoney Cross, thought to date to the eighth century and contemporary with the many carved slabs on Inishmurray. The well was the site of an ancient cattle fair held on 1 February. A shrine with a statue of Saint Bridget was erected in the 1950s.\"St Brigid's Well is situated in Mrs Timoney's field about four hundred yards from the main road in the vicinity of Cliffoney. It was called St Brigid's Well, because when she was travelling through Connaught she visited and blessed it.\"\"In its present state it is difficult to locate it, because it is surrounded by briars. In olden days the people used to come from every district and visit it. They used to go round the Well and said the following prayers Our Father and three Hail Marys.\"\n\nThe lands around Cliffoney were granted to James Byrne after the Cromwellian conquests in the mid 1600s. After 1690 the lands were granted to Sir John Temple. The title Viscount Palmerston was created in 1723. The Palmerston family were absentee landlords, leaving the management of their estates to middlemen. The second Viscount \"contributed generously to local charities in Romsey, but he had no feelings of obligation towards his Irish tenants, and never invested any money in his lands in Sligo.\" \n\nUpon the sudden death of the second Viscount in 1802, the Cliffoney estates were inherited by his oldest son, Henry John Temple, better known as the third Viscount, Lord Palmerston. The young Lord Palmerston visited his Sligo estates, consisting of some 10,000 acres, for the first time in 1808.\"He found a destitute tenantry renting small plots from middlemen, who set the land to tenants in rundale, a system of communal occupation under which an individual tenant might from time to time hold many tiny detached plots. In the early nineteenth century huge tracts of Ahamlish were destroyed by shifting sands, but Palmerston sought to bring the bogs there, as well as the sands ruined by sand, into cultivation.\"Palmerston began a building programme, renovating the old Market House which became a hotel, the Cliffoney Inn in 1820. A boys school was built next door in 1824 and a girls school at the north end of the village in 1826. In further improvements, Alexander Nimmo was engaged to construct a pier in Mullaghmore. While Nimmo was in Cliffoney he designed and constructed apartments for Palmerston over an extension at the back of the Cliffoney Hotel. \n\nThe Roman Catholic church of Saint Molaise was completed and opened in 1829, slightly ahead of Catholic Emancipation. It replaced an earlier structure called Tempeall Bui, located behind the current village hall and close to Saint Bridget's well. \n\n\"In the build up to Catholic Emancipation, in February 1828, religious tensions caused a riot in Cliffoney with extra police required to calm the 239 strong crowd.\" A parochial house called Palmerston Glebe was built in Creevymore for the use of the Catholic priests, with four acres of land attached. Palmerston hired an estate manager to oversee drainage and reclamation projects and built a two-story house called Rundale cottage. In the 1830s a tree nursery was established at Rundale.\n\nFr. O'Flanagan was sent to Cliffoney at the end of July 1914, shortly before the start of WW1. O'Flanagan, a widely travelled curate with strong nationalist, socialist and republican ideals, may have been moved by Bishop Bernard Coyne for his support of the Sligo Dock Strike in May 1913. One of O'Flanagan's first initiatives was to write to Colonel Ashley of Classiebawn Castle, and he secured the old school house as a community hall for the villagers.\n\nUpon discovering social inequity in land redistribution, he led the villagers on a campaign against the Congested Districts Board to secure rights to cut turf on the Cloonerco Bogs adjacent to Cliffoney. This action, which began on 29 June 1915 became known as the Cloonerco Bog Fight. The case simmered on all summer, and the villagers harvested large quantities of turf which was distributed throughout the locality. Eventually the case was settled in favour of the people of Cliffoney.\n\nO'Flanagan was invited to attend the funeral of veteran Fenian Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa in August 1915. He gave a passionate speech at the Reception of Remains in City Hall, where he was photographed with Tom Clarke, Mary Jane and Eileen O'Donovan Rossa. At the graveside O'Flanagan recited the funeral prayers in Irish before his friend Padraig Pearse made his incendiary speech.\n\nIn October O'Flanagan attended a tillage meeting held in Sligo Courthouse, where T. W. Russell was campaigning on behalf of the British Government, for increased tillage production to aid the war effort. When a motion to that effect was proposed, O'Flanagan objected and proposed a counter-motion, advising the people to \"ignore the Board of Agriculture and adopt their own remedy... They should 'Stick to the oats.' This call has ever since been associated with the curate of Cliffoney.\"\"O’Flanagan’s speech ended with a rousing call: ‘The famine of 1847 would never have been written across the pages of history if the men of that day were men enough to risk death rather than part with their oat crop. Let each farmer keep at least as much oats on hand to carry himself and his family through in case of necessity till next years harvest.\"\n\nThe speech was widely reported in the newspapers, and within days O'Flanagan was removed from Cliffoney by Bishop Coyne. In response, on 17 October the villagers of Cliffoney locked the door of St. Molaise's church, and refused to allow a replacement to enter, demanding instead that O'Flanagan be sent back to Cliffoney. The standoff, which became known as the \"Cliffoney Rebellion\" was to last for ten weeks. The people of Cliffoney knelt on the ground outside the locked church and said the Rosary for the return of O'Flanagan. The villagers marched 15 miles into Sligo to have an audience with the Bishop, but he refused to meet them. They also sent a petition to the Pope which was unsuccessful. Eventually the church was re-opened on Christmas Eve, 1915.\n\nAn unfinished memoir, written by O'Flanagan in 1920, describes his version of the events that took place during his time in Cliffoney. The memoir was published as \"From Cliffoney to Crosna\" in 2016 by the Fr. O'Flanagan Memorial Group in Cliffoney.\n\nA company of Volunteers was set up in Cliffoney by Fr. O'Flanagan and Alec McCabe in 1915, were out marching in uniform for Saint Patrick's Day 1916. \"In his report at the end of March the County Inspector mentioned that a branch of the Irish Volunteers had been formed at Cliffony and that other branches were in the process of being formed. He reported that the Cliffony Volunteers had paraded to the number of fifty on St. Patrick's Day wearing uniforms. They attended Mass at Cliffony and then \"paraded the roads.\" Their leaders, William Gilmartin and Andrew Conway, carried revolvers, he reported. On the same day, he said. Alec McCabe led a parade of 69 \"Sinn Féiners\" in Ballymote. McCabe was reported as wearing the uniform of the Irish Volunteers and the others wearing Irish Volunteer armbands.\" \n\nCliffoney village is arranged around a cross-roads on the N15 with the church, community hall, public house and old RIC barracks each occupying a corner. \n\nCliffoney National school was opened in 1914, replacing the old schools built by Lord Palmerston. President Michael D. Higgins visited Cliffoney National school on 22 October 2014 to commemorate the centenary of its opening.\n\nThe Roman Catholic church is dedicated to Saint Molaise from Inishmurray island. The church was closed for an extensive period during restoration in 2012 when masses were held in the village hall. During cleaning the restorers discovered that the three stained glass windows behind the altar were made by Joshua Clarke, father of the stained glass artist Harry Clarke. Joshua Clarke was married to Brigid MacGonigal, a native of Cliffoney. \n\nThe village community hall dates to 1824. The building came into the possession community in 1915 due to the work of Father Michael O'Flanagan. The building became the Cliffoney Sinn Féin club and was used for drilling by the Cliffoney Volunteers. The hall was burned at the end of October 1920 during the reprisals for the Moneygold ambush. It was later rebuilt and renamed the more neutral Cliffoney Parochial Hall.\n\nThe hall was renovated in 2016 with the addition of a new kitchen and restrooms. The hall is used for many community activities and fundraisers. Bingo is held every Saturday evening. The building hosts active age sessions, social dancing and dance classes, Irish dancing, guitar and martial arts classes. \n\nThere are several businesses located in the village, including a hair salon, bars and restaurants, and other retail stores. The Fr. Michael O'Flanagan Memorial Group hosts a traditional music session on the last Saturday of each month in O'Donnell's Bar.There is one shop in the village, Cliffoney Gala, which underwent a refurbishment in September 2017. \n\nCliffoney Country Market takes place on the first and third Sunday of every month. The market sells a range of local produce and features a charity second-hand stall; local musicians provide Irish traditional music.\n\nCliffoney Garda station was closed in early February 2013. The station was handed over to the Cliffoney Development Group by Minister Brian Hayes in July 2014, with plans for the building to be used as a men's shed or tourist office. However, nothing has been done with the station since that time.\n\nCliffoney post office was under threat of closure; however, in August 2018 after a local campaign, it was announced that it will remain open for a further three years, while 159 other post offices would shut down nationwide.\n"}

{"id": "2097383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097383", "title": "Polycaprolactone", "text": "Polycaprolactone\n\nPolycaprolactone (PCL) is a biodegradable polyester with a low melting point of around 60 °C and a glass transition temperature of about −60 °C. The most common use of polycaprolactone is in the production of speciality polyurethanes. Polycaprolactones impart good resistance to water, oil, solvent and chlorine to the polyurethane produced.\n\nThis polymer is often used as an additive for resins to improve their processing characteristics and their end use properties (e.g., impact resistance). Being compatible with a range of other materials, PCL can be mixed with starch to lower its cost and increase biodegradability or it can be added as a polymeric plasticizer to polyvinyl chloride (PVC).\n\nPolycaprolactone is also used for splinting, modeling, and as a feedstock for prototyping systems such as fused filament fabrication 3D printers.\n\nPCL is prepared by ring opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone using a catalyst such as stannous octoate. Recently a wide range of catalysts for the ring opening polymerization of caprolactone have been reviewed.\n\nPCL is degraded by hydrolysis of its ester linkages in physiological conditions (such as in the human body) and has therefore received a great deal of attention for use as an implantable biomaterial. In particular it is especially interesting for the preparation of long term implantable devices, owing to its degradation which is even slower than that of polylactide.\n\nPCL has been widely used in long-term implants and controlled drug release applications. However, when it comes to tissue engineering, PCL suffers from some shortcomings such as slow degradation rate, poor mechanical properties, and low cell adhesion. The incorporation of calcium phosphate-based ceramics and bioactive glasses into PCL has yielded a class of hybrid biomaterials with remarkably improved mechanical properties, controllable degradation rates, and enhanced bioactivity that are suitable for bone tissue engineering.\n\nPCL has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in specific applications used in the human body as (for example) a drug delivery device, suture, or adhesion barrier.] PCL is used in the rapidly growing field of human esthetics following the recent introduction of a PCL-based microsphere dermal filler belonging to the collagen stimulator class (Ellansé).\n\nThrough the stimulation of collagen production, PCL-based products are able to correct facial ageing signs such as volume loss and contour laxity, providing an immediate and long-lasting natural effect. It is being investigated as a scaffold for tissue repair by tissue engineering, GBR membrane. It has been used as the hydrophobic block of amphiphilic synthetic block copolymers used to form the vesicle membrane of polymersomes.\n\nA variety of drugs have been encapsulated within PCL beads for controlled release and targeted drug delivery.\n\nIn dentistry (as the composite named Resilon), it is used as a component of \"night guards\" (dental splints) and in root canal filling. It performs like gutta-percha, has similar handling properties, and for re-treatment purposes may be softened with heat, or dissolved with solvents like chloroform. Similar to gutta-percha, there are master cones in all ISO sizes and accessory cones in different sizes and taper available. The major difference between the polycaprolactone-based root canal filling material (Resilon and Real Seal) and gutta-percha is that the PCL-based material is biodegradable, whereas gutta-percha is not. There is a lack of consensus in the expert dental community as to whether a biodegradable root canal filling material, such as Resilon or Real Seal is desirable.\n\nPCL also has many applications in the hobbyist market where it is known as Plastimake, NiftyFix, Protoplastic, InstaMorph, Polymorph, Shapelock, ReMoldables, Plastdude or TechTack. It has physical properties of a very tough, nylon-like plastic that softens to a putty-like consistency at only 60 °C, easily achieved by immersing in hot water. PCL's specific heat and conductivity are low enough that it is not hard to handle by hand at this temperature. This makes it ideal for small-scale modeling, part fabrication, repair of plastic objects, and rapid prototyping where heat resistance is not needed. Though softened PCL readily sticks to many other plastics when at higher temperature, if the surface is cooled, the stickiness can be minimized while still leaving the mass pliable.\n\nFirmicutes and proteobacteria can degrade PCL. \"Penicillium\" sp. strain 26-1 can degrade high density PCL; though not as quickly as thermotolerant \"Aspergillus\" sp. strain ST-01. Species of \"Clostridium\" can degrade PCL under anaerobic conditions.\n\n"}

He was one of the original settlers of Augusta and an early settler of Busselton.\n\nThe outline of John Molloy's birth and early life are believed by some to be clear, though we have little detail and published accounts vary greatly. This is just one possible version that he was the same John Molloy who was baptised at St Martins in the Fields in Trafalgar Square, London, on 8 October 1786, the son of William and Mary Molloy. As John celebrated his birthday on the 5 September in later life, his birthdate may have been 5 September 1786.\n\nThis William Molloy had a shoe warehouse at 16 High St, St Giles, London. He made his will in 1804, leaving bequests to his son, John, and his daughter, Susanna, who were to inherit their shares of the estate when they reached the age of 21. The will also stipulates regular payments from the estate to William Molloy's mother who was living in Kings County, now co. Offaly, Ireland. St Giles was well known as a quarter where Irish tradesmen settled. William Molloy died in December 1804.\n\nJohn Molloy was able to buy a commission in the Rifle Brigade on 17 December 1807, just over three months after his 21st birthday, when he came into his inheritance. He fought in the Peninsular War of 1808–10 and was promoted Lieutenant in 1809. Then, during a two-year break in military engagements, he attended the Royal Military College, Great Marlow. From 1812 to 1814, he fought in the Napoleonic Wars under Wellington, taking part in eight battles. In 1815 he fought at Waterloo where he was badly wounded and received the Waterloo Medal. After recovering his health, he returned to active duty, being posted to Glasgow in 1819–20, then Ireland until 1825. In 1824 he was promoted to Captain.\n\nOn 6 August 1829, Molloy married Georgiana Kennedy, and began to consider emigrating to Western Australia. The Molloys eventually sailed for Western Australia on board the \"Warrior\" in October 1829. On arriving at the Swan River Colony in March 1830, Molloy was advised by Governor Stirling that the best land in the area had already been granted. Stirling suggested instead that the Molloys join with some other newly arrived settlers in forming a subcolony in the vicinity of Cape Leeuwin. Late in April, a group of prospective settlers including the Molloys and Bussells accompanied Stirling and his official party to the proposed site of the subcolony. After a four-day exploring expedition up the Blackwood River, Stirling confirmed his decision to establish a settlement at the location. The settlers' possessions were unloaded, and Molloy was appointed Government Resident and Resident magistrate for the settlement, to be called Augusta.\n\nFor the first few years of the settlement, Molloy's main tasks, other than establishment of his own farm, were the allocation of land, and laying out of the townsite. When Molloy named the streets and coastal features of Augusta in 1832, he chose the names and titles of the Duke of York, who had died five years previously: \"Osnaburg Street\", \"York Street\", \"Albany Terrace\", \"Duke's Head\" and \"Point Frederick\".\n\nIn 1839 he moved to Busselton, and began to work on building a property called Fair Lawn in what is now Bovell. He became the town's first magistrate, which he found more complicated than at Augusta because of the presence of American whalers and difficult relationships with the Indigenous Australians.\n\nMolloy's wife died in 1843, but he decided to stay on at Busselton. In 1850, he visited England, returning to Western Australia in 1852. On his return, he continued as Busselton's magistrate, dealing with the arrival of convicts. In 1859 he transferred to the 9th Foot and was promoted Major and Lieutenant-Colonel, but sold the commission the same day. He resigned as Government Resident in March 1851 on grounds of old age. From 1860 on, he gradually turned over management of his property to Richard Gale. He died on 6 October 1867, and was buried alongside his wife. The age given on Molloy’s grave, 87, is inaccurate: it should be 81. \nJohn Molloy's eldest daughter Sabina married Matthew Blagden Hale, who became the first Anglican Bishop of Perth. Another daughter Flora married William Locke Brockman.\n\n"}

The settlement was also at times previously termed \"Cashel\", KillinBridge\" or even \"Cowlowney\".\n\nDuring the Irish Rebellion of 1798, a battle took place outside the town in which a combined French and Irish force defeated British troops from the Sligo garrison. Known as the Battle of Collooney (or Battle of Carricknagat), this conflict is commemorated by the Teeling Monument outside the town - named for a member of the United Irishmen who was involved in the battle.\n\nIn the 18th century and bleach mill was built locally by Charles O'Hara in an effort to increase industry in the Sligo area. O'Hara brought in weavers and bleachers from the north to settle in the Collooney area. The mill finally closed in 1956. The mill was also used at certain times in its history for the production of carbide, a mixture of coal, coke and lime.\n\nThe main part of the town lies to south west of the Owenmore River which joins the Unshin River just to the north of the town to form the Ballysadare River.\nCollooney is located just off the N4 (Dublin to Sligo) and N17 (Sligo to Galway) roads, having been bypassed twice, by the N4 in 1998, and the N17 in 1992, and is the meeting point of both roads. \n\nThe town was a significant railway centre, with no less than three railway stations.

Amongst three definitions: to induce a person to commit a wrongful act ... esp. in a secret or underhanded manner; to induce a person to commit perjury; and to obtain perjured testimony from another.\n\nIn legal practice, the condition of suborning perjury applies to an attorney who presents either testimony or an affidavit, or both, either to a judge or to a jury, which the attorney knows to be materially false, and not factual. In civil law and in criminal law, the attorney's knowledge that the testimony is materially false must rise above mere suspicion to what an attorney would reasonably have believed in the circumstances of the matter discussed in the testimony. Hence, the attorney cannot be wilfully blind to the fact that his or her witness is giving false, perjurious testimony.\n\nAn attorney who encourages a witness to give false testimony is suborning perjury, a crime punished either with formal disciplinary action, disbarment, jail, or a combination thereof. A false statement by an attorney in court also is a crime similar to subornation of perjury and is punished accordingly. In the professional conduct of an attorney at law, there is a fine delineation between assisting a witness to recall events and encouraging the witness to give materially false testimony. The practice of ″horse shedding the witness″ (rehearsing testimony) (also known as woodshedding), is an example of such perjurious criminal conduct by an attorney, which is depicted in the true-crime novel \"Anatomy of a Murder\" (1958), by Robert Traver John D. Voelker, a justice of the Michigan Supreme Court and in the eponymous film (Otto Preminger, 1959), about a rape-and-murder case wherein are explored the ethical and legal problems inherent to the subornation of perjury.\n\n"}

Sligo for the settlement of Nagnata as marked on Claudius Ptolemy's early map of Ireland. The name Codnach means placid or even tempered river. A battle was fought on this river in A.M. 3656 (1538 BC) by the legendary Milesian monarch Tigearnmas.

Taxicabs are operated by private companies and licensed by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). It also oversees over 40,000 other for-hire vehicles, including \"black cars\", commuter vans, and ambulettes.\n\nTaxicab vehicles, each of which must have a medallion to operate, are driven an average of 180 miles per shift. , there were 51,398 individuals licensed to drive medallion taxicabs. There were 13,605 taxicab medallion licenses in existence. , that number had dropped slightly to 13,587 medallions, or 18 lower than the 2014 total. Taxi patronage has declined since 2011 due to competition from rideshare services.\n\nThe medallion system was created in 1937 as a government imposed limitation on the supply of taxicabs, requiring that a medallion be purchased for the right to operate a taxi. Thereafter, New York did not sell any medallions until 1996, when it auctioned slightly more than 2,000. The lack of new medallions resulted in such a shortage that by 2014 they were selling for more than $1 million each, with about 14,000 medallions in existence. Since then, the increase in rideshare vehicles, which numbered about 63,000 in 2015 and 100,000 by August 2018, has drastically reduced the market price of medallions.\n\n, there are around 7,990 hybrid taxi vehicles, representing almost 59% of the taxis in service—the most in any city in North America. The Nissan NV200 won the city's bid to become the \"Taxi of Tomorrow\" to replace most of the city's taxi fleet, with its introduction scheduled for October 2012. Nevertheless, this decision has faced several lawsuits and criticism, with the NV200 subject to comparisons with more cost-effective and widely adopted models. , 6,000 Street Hail Livery (SHL) permits have been issued, 20% of which must be used with wheelchair-accessible vehicles, with 4,478 Street Hail Livery vehicles already in use by that time.\n\nAll types of taxis are licensed by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), which oversees for-hire vehicles, taxis, commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles. The iconic taxicabs come in two colors. The apple green taxis, which are called street hail livery vehicles or \"boro taxis,\" operate only outside the Manhattan central business district, excluding John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport. These taxis started operating in August 2013, with 18,000 licenses being added in three waves of 6,000; the first group of 6,000 licenses was added in 2014. The yellow \"medallion\" taxicabs can pick up anywhere in the city, and numbered 13,437 licenses in 2014. \n\nThe TLC oversees over 100,000 for-hire vehicles, including \"black cars\"; \"livery cars\"; commuter \"dollar vans\"; luxury limousines; and paratransit vehicles. Black cars cannot be hailed on the street, instead they must be dispatched by a parent business. These businesses usually use luxury cars such as a Lincoln Town Car due to their almost-exclusively business clientele, and drivers ordinarily get less than 10% of their income in cash. There were around 500 base stations for black cars, comprising a total fleet of 25,000 vehicles, as of the 2014 TLC Factbook. Livery cars are similar to black cars, but are used by a greater range of people. There were 80 livery bases and 10,000 livery vehicles in 2014. Commuter vans carry more people, usually between 9 and 20 passengers per trip. Commuter van licenses were held by 50 entities, which collectively owned 500 vehicles, in 2014. Luxury limousine providers and private paratransit companies numbered 200 each in 2014, collectively chartering 7,000 luxury limousine vehicles and 2,000 paratransit vehicles. In 2015, there were 14,000 for-hire vehicles associated with one or more of four ride-sharing companies of the time: Juno, Lyft, Uber, and Via. By 2018, over 80,000 such vehicles were being driven for \"ride-share\".\n\nThe average hourly gross income for a medallion driver in 2015 was $30.41, not including tips, according to the 2016 TLC Factbook. Boro (green) taxi drivers made $20.63, also excluding tips. Evening hours are typically more lucrative. Medallion Taxis collectively make between 300,000 and 400,000 trips a day, while Green Taxis, which hit the road in New York City in 2013, do almost 50,000 daily on average. While the TLC does not regulate specific shifts, the morning shift for a medallion taxi typically begins at 5:30 a.m., and the evening shift often starts at 5:15 p.m.. Trips peak Friday evenings for medallion cabs, and Saturday night for Green Taxis.\n\nThere were about 143,674 taxis and for-hire vehicles licensed by the TLC in 2015, according to the 2016 Factbook. These include 13,587 Medallion Taxicabs; 7,676 boro taxis; 38,791 black cars; 21,932 livery cars; 288 commuter vans; and 2,206 paratransit vehicles. Passengers in New York City can arrange rides using smartphone apps in yellow medallion taxicabs, Boro (green) cabs, and for-hire vehicles. Each type of TLC-licensed vehicle has its own set of guidelines in regards to app usage, and the TLC has adopted new rules that codify these standards. Any companies that want to operate point-to-point for-hire service within the five boroughs, whether through an app or a phone call, need a TLC license to operate. They must also work only with TLC-licensed drivers and vehicles. \n\nTLC-licensed drivers self-reported 167 different countries as their place of birth in the 2000 United States Census, and of all TLC drivers in 2000, 84% were immigrants, up from the 64% figure reported in 1990 and the 38% reported in 1980. That year, about 18% of drivers identified their place of birth as Bangladesh, the country where the most taxi drivers reported themselves as having been born. Drivers providing app-based services identify most commonly as being born in South Asia and the Caribbean/West Indies. Additionally, 97% of New York City taxi drivers self-reported as male and only 2.5% to 3% self-reported as female. This still held mostly true in 2015, where the greatest number of TLC drivers, about 14%, identified their place of birth as Bangladesh, followed by 12% the Dominican Republic; 9% each from the United States and Pakistan; and 6% from India. , about half of traditional for-hire vehicle drivers were from the Dominican Republic, and nearly a quarter of medallion drivers were from Bangladesh. Additionally, the vast majority of TLC drivers were still male, with female TLC drivers making up from 1% of medallion taxi drivers to 4% of app-based for-hire vehicle drivers. The average TLC driver was middle-aged, with app-based drivers having a median age of 39 and all other drivers having a median age of 46–47. \n\nThe TLC has a Driver Safety Honor Roll recognizes the safest Taxi and For-Hire Vehicle drivers in New York City. Drivers on the Honor Roll have had no crashes involving fatalities or injuries, no traffic violations, and no violations of TLC safety-related rules for five years or more.\n\nMedallion (yellow) cabs are concentrated in the borough of Manhattan, but can be hailed anywhere throughout the five boroughs of New York City and may be hailed with a raised hand or by standing at a taxi stand. Boro taxis in \"apple green\" color can be hailed only in the outer boroughs (except at the airports) and in the northern part of Manhattan, specifically above 96th street on the east side and above 110th street on the west side.\n\nBefore 2011, a cab's availability was indicated by the lights on the top of the car. When no lights were lit, the cab would be occupied by passengers. When just the center light showing the medallion number was lit, the cab would be empty and available. When the OFF and DUTY inscriptions to either side of the medallion number were lit, with the medallion number off, the cab would be off duty and not accepting passengers. However, when the OFF and DUTY inscriptions were lit and the medallion number was still lit, the cab would be off duty but the driver could choose to pick up passengers heading in the same direction as the driver. In fall 2011, the TLC announced a plan to replace the three-light system with a simple indicator as to whether the taxi is available. In 2012, the TLC simplified the light system further, with a lit roof light indicating that the taxi is available and an unlit light indicating that the taxi is not available, regardless of whether it has passengers or is simply off duty. It also started fining drivers $100 for picking up passengers without the light on, except for if the driver is picking up their last passenger of their shift.\n\nAs with livery cabs, there is an additional round amber light mounted on the left side of the trunk, as well as an amber light at the front of the cab, usually hidden from view behind the grille. When activated by the driver, these \"trouble lights\" blink to summon the police.\n\nA maximum of four passengers may be carried in most cabs, although larger minivans may accommodate five passengers, and one child under seven can sit on an adult’s lap in the back seat if the maximum has been reached. Drivers are required to pick up the first or closest passenger they see, and may not refuse a trip to a destination anywhere within the five boroughs, neighboring Westchester or Nassau, or Newark Liberty International Airport. The TLC undertakes undercover operations to ensure cabbies do not engage in racial profiling or otherwise discriminate against passengers hailing cabs.\n\nThe majority of electronic hails in 2016 came from northern Brooklyn; the Upper East and Upper West Sides of Manhattan; Astoria, Queens; and East Village, Manhattan. In 2015, the TLC recorded 7 million trips in the 541 wheelchair-accessible vehicles, up from 6 million in the previous year.\n\n, fares begin at $2.50 ($3.00 between 8:00 p.m. and 6:00 am, and $3.50 during the peak weekday hours of 4:00–8:00 p.m.) and increase based on the distance traveled and time spent in slow traffic (50 cents for each one-fifth of a mile or each 50 seconds stopped or traveling under 12 miles an hour). An additional 50¢ tax is added to all trips within New York City. For trips to Nassau and Westchester counties, fare is the metered rate from the point of origin to the city limit, then twice the metered rate from the city limit to the destination. All trips between Manhattan and John F. Kennedy International Airport are charged a flat rate of $52. All trips to Newark Airport are charged the metered rate plus $17.50. The passenger also has to pay for any portion of the trip where the cab is driven on a toll road. The taxi must have an E-ZPass tag, and passengers pay the discounted E-ZPass toll rates.\n\nIn 1999, 241 million passengers rode in New York taxis. The average cab fare in 2000 was $6; passengers paid a total of over $1 billion in fares that year. By 2006, the number had remained unchanged at about 240 million annual passengers. \n\nAccording to an April 2011 study by the \"Chicago Dispatcher\", New York City taxis have a relatively low standard fare, charging an estimated $14.10 for a distance of five miles and five minutes' wait time (compared to an estimated $18.48 in West Hollywood and $12.87 in Houston). Taxi drivers are not permitted to use cell phones while transporting passengers, even if they use a hands-free headset, although this is widely ignored by drivers.\n\n, drivers earned an average of $158 after a 12-hour shift, but this figure has declined in the succeeding years, given that an increasing number of medallions have been leased since then.\n\nThe first taxicab company in New York City was the Samuel's Electric Carriage and Wagon Company (E.C.W.C.), which began running 12 electric hansom cabs in July 1897. The company ran until 1898 with up to 62 cabs operating until it was reformed by its financiers to form the Electric Vehicle Company. The company then built the Electrobat electric car, and had up to 100 taxicabs running in total by 1899.\n\n1899 also saw a number of notable firsts for the Electric Vehicle Company. On May 20, 1899, Jacob German, driving an electric taxicab received the first speeding ticket in the United States. Later that year, on September 13, Henry Bliss became the first victim of an automotive accident in the United States when he was hit by an electric taxicab as he was helping a friend from a streetcar.\n\nBy the early 1900s the Electric Vehicle company was running up to 1,000 electric taxicabs on the streets of New York City until, in January 1907, a fire destroyed 300 of these vehicles, which, in conjunction with the Panic of 1907 caused the company to collapse.\n\nIn 1907, following the collapse of the Electric Vehicle Company, horse-drawn cabs once again became a primary means of transport around New York City. In early 1907 Harry N. Allen, incensed after being charged five dollars () for a journey of , decided \"to start a [taxicab] service in New York and charge so-much per mile.\" Later that year he imported 65 gasoline-powered cars from France and began the New York Taxicab Company. The cabs were originally painted red and green, but Allen repainted them all yellow to be visible from a distance. By 1908 the company was running 700 taxicabs.\n\nWithin a decade several more companies opened business and taxicabs began to proliferate. The fare was 50 cents a mile (), a rate only affordable to the relatively wealthy.\n\nBy the 1920s, automobile manufacturers like General Motors and the Ford Motor Company began operating fleets. The most successful manufacturer, however, was the Checker Cab Manufacturing Company. Founded by Morris Markin, Checker Cabs produced large yellow and black taxis that became the most common taxis in New York City.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, New York had as many as 30,000 cab drivers. With more drivers than passengers, cab drivers were working longer hours, which led to growing public concern over the maintenance and mechanical integrity of taxi vehicles. To resolve these issues, the city considered creating a taxi monopoly, but the plan was abandoned after New York City Mayor Jimmy Walker was accused of accepting a bribe from the Parmelee Company, the largest taxi company.\n\nIn 1937, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia signed the Haas Act, which introduced official taxi licenses and the medallion system that remains in place today. The law limited the total number of cab licenses to 16,900, but the number dwindled to 11,787 licenses, staying equal over the next six decades.\n\nIn the 1960s, New York City experienced many of the problems other cities did. Crime and racial tensions increased. As a result, a quickly growing industry of private livery services emerged, commonly referred to as \"car services\". Unofficial drivers were barred from picking up people on the street, but they readily found business in under-served neighborhoods.\n\nIn 1967, New York City ordered all \"medallion taxis\" be painted yellow to help cut down on unofficial drivers and make official taxicabs more readily recognizable. The wife of the president of New Departure, Nettie Rockwell, particularly liked the color yellow and it therefore became the color of the new Rockwell taxicabs. The Rockwell Service Cab became the Yellow Taxicab when Mrs. Rockwell selected that as her choice of color for the auto.\n\nThe New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) was established in 1971 with jurisdiction over the city's medallion (yellow) taxicabs, livery cabs, \"black cars\", commuter vans, paratransit vehicles (ambulettes), and some luxury limousines. Its predecessor was the New York City Hack Bureau, operated under the aegis of the New York City Police Department. TLC Inspectors are New York State peace officers.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, crime in New York City had become extremely severe. Cabbies were often robbed, injured, or murdered. Despite widespread use of bullet-resistant taxi partitions, introduced in 1967, seven cab drivers were killed and 3,000 were robbed in the first nine months of 1970. The response from regulators was to contend that \"continued violent crime against cab drivers\" (despite partition mandates) merited a new \"lock-box\" requirement. That requirement was abandoned, quietly, after it was realized that in response, the cabs themselves in the city were being stolen.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, there was a shortage in drivers, and as many as one-fifth of taxicabs were in the garage at any given time. Drivers only needed to take a test to show proof that they understood English; demonstrate knowledge of 29 major corridors and 168 routes to popular landmarks; and be able to point out the locations of ten to fifteen landmarks, using a geographical directory provided during the test. Despite the fact that many potential applicants did not know locations outside Manhattan well, almost all applicants passed the test. By 1975, although the TLC was issuing 40,000 licenses yearly, there was a high proportion of new drivers: less than one-third of the 40,000 licenses were those being renewed by cab drivers who were already working, while two-thirds of the licenses were issued to new drivers.\n\nFrom the mid-1980s into the 1990s, demographics changed among cabbies as new waves of immigrants arrived to New York City. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, of the 62,000 cab drivers in New York City, 82% were foreign born: 23% being from the Caribbean (the Dominican Republic and Haiti) and 30% being from South Asia (Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan).\n\nThroughout the 1980s, working conditions for cabbies changed as crime in New York City was curtailed. Additionally, the cost of medallion licenses increased and fewer cabbies owned their taxicabs.\n\nDuring the 1980s, production of the iconic Checker Taxi Cab ceased although many remained in operation. The Chevrolet Caprice and Ford Crown Victoria became the industry's top choices, with formerly used police cruisers providing a steady supply for cab fleets.\n\nOn October 26, 1993, thousands of taxi drivers used their taxis to block traffic in protest at the number of taxi drivers who had been murdered: 35 taxi drivers had been murdered so far that year, and 45 had been killed the previous year.\n\nIn 1996, Chevrolet ceased making the Caprice. The Ford Crown Victoria became the most widely used sedan for yellow cabs in New York. In addition, yellow cab operators also used the Honda Odyssey, Isuzu Oasis, Chevrolet Venture, Ford Freestar, and Toyota Sienna minivans, which offer increased passenger room. The distinctive Checker Taxi cabs were, due to their durable construction, phased out slowly. The last one was retired in July 1999, after more than 20 years in service and with nearly one million miles on its odometer. Laws since 1996 require that taxis be replaced every six years regardless of condition; this was increased to seven years in 2015.\n\nThe same year, the TLC began \"Operation Refusal\", an undercover sting operation created to address the alleged phenomenon of service refusal. In 1998, the TLC enacted a package of regulatory reforms, inspired by Mayor Rudy Giuliani, that included a structured framework of enhanced driver standards. In 1999, actor Danny Glover filed a complaint with the TLC, after he was allegedly refused service by New York cab drivers. This resulted in a highly publicized Operation Refusal crackdown on drivers who were allegedly discriminating against certain passengers, sometimes for race, but far more often because of the passenger's destination.\n\nMany cabdrivers protested the new regulations sought by the Giuliani administration. In 1998, their activity formed the basis of a new taxidrivers' trade union, the New York Taxi Workers Alliance. Under the leadership of Bhairavi Desai, the union grew to fifteen thousand members (2011 estimate), representing almost one-third of all licensed cabdrivers in the city. Giuliani's crackdowns also led to a series of successful lawsuits against the city and the TLC. In 2000, a federal judge ruled that the NYPD had violated taxi drivers' First Amendment rights by refusing to let the drivers engage in a peaceful protest of new rules. The TLC also lost a series of cases in state courts, for implementing rules without allowing for notice and comment. In 2000, another federal judge ruled that the Operation Refusal sting violated cabbies' due process rights. In 2004, TLC inspectors were embarrassed when they handcuffed and arrested \"60 Minutes\" reporter Mike Wallace, charging him with disorderly conduct for allegedly having acted aggressively toward a TLC Inspector in defense of his driver. In 2006, the city was forced to settle the remaining aspects of the Operation Refusal case. Under the settlement, the TLC agreed to pay a group of 500 taxi drivers $7 million.\n\nIn order to encourage greater use of passenger seat belts to prevent partition-related injuries, the TLC instituted the \"Celebrity Talking Taxi\" program in 1997, using celebrity audio messages to urge passengers to buckle up and take a receipt at the ride's conclusion. The messages proved largely unpopular with both drivers and riders, as the TLC learned after conducting an online survey about the program in the fall of 2002. On the strength of those results, the Commission officially terminated the program in February 2003.\n\nIn 1996, the number of medallions changed for the first time in 60 years. The TLC added 133 new licenses, bringing the total to 11,920. Since 1996, more medallions have been added to the fleet bringing the total number of cab licenses to 13,237 as of 2009.\n\nIn 2005, New York introduced incentives to replace its current yellow cabs with electric hybrid vehicles such as the Toyota Prius and Ford Escape Hybrid. In May 2007, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed a five-year plan to switch New York City's taxicabs to more fuel-efficient hybrid vehicles as part of an agenda for New York City to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the plan was dropped after cab companies complained that the cost of maintaining the new hybrid vehicles vastly outweighed the tiny amount of fuel savings they got from going smaller. Proponents of the traditional Lincoln Town Car and Ford Crown Victoria say they were well suited to their task, while others said customers who cared for the environment preferred hybrids. Not only that, but passenger safety also became an issue with the newer vehicles, and 6 months after the program took effect, it was dropped. Still, the proportion of the taxi fleet made up of Crown Victorias has dropped over time. In 2010, it stood at about 60% of yellow cabs, as the number of Ford Escape Hybrid and Toyota Sienna minivans kept rising. The percentage of Crown Victoria taxis in the city would be further undercut by the adoption of the similarly sized Toyota Camry Hybrids since 2010, and the Toyota Prius V. By 2015, the Ford Crown Victoria fleet would be nearly entirely replaced.\n\nOriginally, before October 2007, NYC Yellow cabs displayed the fare stickers in the front doors and the words \"NYC Taxi\" and the medallion number on the back doors. On September 30, 2007, all of the yellow cab decals were redesigned. The cabs were easily identified with the medallion number followed with a checker pattern on the left and right rear fenders, a futuristic fare panel on the rear doors, and a retro \"NYC Taxi\" logo on the front doors, with a yellow T in a black circle. In August 2012, the TLC phased out the design in favor of one that drops the \"axi,\" leaving only the NYC logo and the circle-T. The detailed fare information on the rear doors was also replaced, replaced with a simple statement of a metered rate unless traveling to JFK Airport, where a flat fare is charged.\n\nThe TLC also mandated that by the end of January 2008 all taxis should be equipped with a Passenger Information Monitor that is a screen in the backseat that can provide entertainment, a live GPS map of location, and be used to pay for rides by swiping a credit card. The drivers will have an electronic Driver Information Monitor in which messages can be sent to them informing them of traffic conditions and facilitating retrieving lost objects. Several taxicab drivers objecting to the cost of the devices (estimated at between $3,000 and $5,000 each) staged voluntary strikes on September 5 and 6 and October 22 in 2007. The city implemented a \"zone pricing\" structure during the days and the strikes had minimal impact on the city according to officials.\n\n, New York City had around 4,300 hybrid taxis, representing almost 33% of the 13,237 taxis in service, and about 6,000 by September 2012, representing 59% of the taxis in service—the most in any city in North America. By mid-2009, owners began retiring their original hybrid fleets after they accumulated between 300,000 and 350,000 miles per vehicle. Two attempts by the Bloomberg administration to implement policies to force the replacement of all 13,000 New York taxis for hybrids by 2012 were blocked by court rulings, and on February 28, 2011, the United States Supreme Court declined to consider an appeal by the city.\n\nIn 2007, city officials outlined a project to replace existing Ford Crown Victoria taxis—which were discontinued in 2011—and other taxis by 2014. In mid-2011, the TLC was to award an exclusive contract to sell and service taxicabs in New York City for 10 years. Karsan, Nissan, and Ford's bids were the three finalists, and all of their designs were based on small vans rather than sedans. The Karsan design was favorite among the New Yorkers. However, later was rejected due to doubts whether the company could \"execute the project\". In the end, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced the Nissan design as the winner to replace the city's 13,000 yellow cabs, to be phased in over five years starting in 2013.\n\nAs of August 2013, manufacturing had begun in Cuernavaca, Mexico, where the stock NV200 is also assembled. Design features include room for four passengers, a transparent roof panel, independently controlled rear air conditioning, active carbon-lined headliner to help neutralize interior odors, along with antimicrobial easy-to-clean seat fabric, overhead reading lights, floor lighting, a mobile charging station, including a 12-volt electrical outlet and two USB ports, a flat passenger floor, a \"low-annoyance\" horn with exterior lights that indicate honking, hearing loop system, intercom and exterior lights that signal when door is opening.\n\nIn 2011, New York City was sued by United Spinal Association for choosing an inaccessible \"taxi of tomorrow\". The Justice Department issued a \"Statement of Interest\", which was sent to the NY Federal District court, stating that, if the city did not mandate a wheelchair accessible taxi as the \"taxi of tomorrow\", it would be in violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act. On November 3–5, 2011, at the TLC's public design expo inviting the public to try out parked prototypes, the Taxis For All Campaign mounted a \"Roll-In\" protest. Under the eye of news media outside the Flatiron Building on Broadway at Fifth Avenue, wheelchair users tried in vain to use the future cabs. Mayor Bloomberg's sustained initiative to amend the law, so that licensed livery cabs may pick up street hails just as yellow medallion cabs do, requires the Governor's approval; but Governor Andrew Cuomo opposes the City's choice of a non-wheelchair-accessible yellow cab. Thus, a compromise plan was announced in December 2011: the next 4,000 new medallions must go to accessible cabs, and the Governor will ratify the Mayor's initiative to let livery cars compete for street hails.\n\nA fully electric version of the Nissan NV200 van may be available by 2017. However, to test the concept, Nissan is sponsoring a pilot program with six Nissan Leaf electric cars and their charging stations, deployed to study the use of zero-emission electric vehicles as taxis. The Leafs were initially scheduled to be deployed in 2012, one year before the Nissan NV200s taxis were scheduled to be introduced. The pilot program was launched in April 2013, and by June 2013, only four Leafs are providing cab service in the city. Still, , the number of new NV200 cabs in New York City remained low.\n\nThe deployment of the city's Taxi of Tomorrow would result in almost all the existing fleet, of which about 6,000 are hybrid electric vehicles, to be replaced within 3 years with the non hybrid Nissan NV200 passenger van. Only about 1,000 taxis will be exempted for various reasons, such as 273 taxis whose medallions require that they be high-mileage vehicles. However, in early 2013 the Greater New York Taxi Association filed suit against the city arguing that the Taxi of Tomorrow plan violates a section of the city’s administrative code because the Nissan NV200 is not a hybrid. In May 2013 a State Supreme Court judge blocked the Bloomberg administration’s plan for introducing the Taxi of Tomorrow, ruling that indeed it violated a New York City provision requiring a hybrid option for taxi operators. City officials did not challenge the judge’s ruling. In June 2013, the Taxi and Limousine Commission approved an adjusted set of rules in an effort to introduce the Taxi of Tomorrow as scheduled by October 2013. According to the adjusted rules, only hybrids with a large interior of at least will be permitted. Taxi operators complained that the only compliant hybrids are prohibitively expensive. A spokesman for the commission noted that the Toyota Prius v is available for , about less than the NV200. The two other hybrids, which comply with the rule, are the Lexus RX450h () and the Toyota Highlander Hybrid ().\n\nHistorically, only yellow medallion taxicabs were permitted to pick up passengers in response to a street hail. The TLC also regulates and licenses for-hire vehicles, known as \"car services\" or \"livery cabs,\" which are prohibited from picking up street hails (although this rule is less often enforced in the boroughs outside Manhattan) and are supposed to pick up only those customers who have called the car service's dispatcher and requested a car. Following state legislation passed in 2011, the TLC voted in April 2012 to allow livery cabs to be licensed to make street pick-ups in the outer boroughs and northern Manhattan, a rule in effect starting in summer 2012. The implementation was held up with litigation, but on June 6, 2013, the New York State Court of Appeals, the State's highest court, found that the regulation of taxicabs was a compelling state interest, and that therefore the New York Legislature had acted within its rights when it authorized the new class of taxis. The Taxi and Limousine Commission plans to authorize up to 6,000 cabs per year for three years, ultimately creating a total of 18,000 green taxis. They first appeared in August 2013.\n\nParticipating drivers must have their car painted and the Taxi logo and information printed, and also the affiliated base on the rear sides, and cameras, meters and GPS added. The GPS will not allow the meter to work if the cab is starting in Manhattan below East 96th or West 110th streets, and in the airports.\n\nThe New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission has enforced strict requirements for the color of medallion taxicabs since the late 1960s. According to the \"Rules of New York City\", \"The exterior of the vehicle must be painted taxi yellow (Dupont M6284 or its equivalent), except for trim. Samples of paint color and shade are to be submitted to the commission for approval.\" The specified M6284 paint code is actually a Ford code for school bus yellow.\n\n, there are several approved models for use as New York City medallion taxis.<br>\nThere is no restriction on the makes and models for boro taxis.\n\nApproved vehicles must have air conditioning for the backseat rows, as well as sufficient space to install the partition behind the front row.\n\nWhile medallion taxicabs in the city are always yellow and boro taxis are green, car service vehicles may be any color but yellow; they are usually black and are sometimes called \"black car\" services. Despite the \"de jure\" prohibition on picking up passengers who hail on the street, some livery cabs nevertheless do so anyway, often to make extra money. When a livery cab engages in street pick-ups, it becomes known as a \"gypsy cab.\" They are often found in areas not routinely visited by medallion cabs, and authorities tend to ignore the practice rather than leave sections of the city without cab service.\n\nAs of 2012, New York taxis are only crash-tested before being equipped as a cab. However, the new \"Taxi of Tomorrow\", the Nissan NV200, would also have its partition be crash-tested while installed inside the vehicle.\n\nMedallion taxicabs are named after the medallion issued by the TLC and attached to a taxi’s hood. , there were 51,398 individuals licensed to drive medallion taxicabs. There were 13,605 taxicab medallion licenses in existence. Taxicab vehicles, each of which must have a medallion to operate, are driven an average of per shift. The average total number of annual taxi passengers is 241 million. By July 2016, that number had dropped slightly to 13,587 medallions, or 18 lower than the 2014 total. However, the number of drivers in April 2016 had plummeted to 30,488, caused by an exodus of drivers who went to drive for ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft.\n\nThere are currently 13,347 regular medallions, running from 1A10 to 9Y99, and including 136 SBV (\"Standby vehicle\") licenses, and TLC1 and TLC3. The letter series runs from 10 to 99, then advances to the next letter, skipping I, O, Q, R, S, X, Z. After Y, the first digit advances. Most cabs continue to bear license plates with a variation of the medallion number, but new issues from March 2018 in the format Y123456C with standby vehicles in the format S123456V. The numbers assigned to boro taxis are not medallion numbers, but they are TLC Street Hail Livery license numbers that consist of two letters followed by three numbers. The two letters progress in alphabetical order from right to left: the \"AA\" series is issued first, then \"AB\", \"AC\", all the way to \"AZ\", at which point the letters progress to \"BA\", \"BB\", \"BC\", etc. The license plates retain the previous numbers as a livery cab.\n\nThe New York City Police Department operates a fleet of five undercover taxis. These vehicles operate with medallions beginning with either 2W or 6Y.\n\nMedallions were first issued in 1937 when the city created a licensing scheme, setting the number of cabs at 11,787. This number remained fixed until 1996. Because the medallion system artificially restricts the number of cabs, it has been criticized as an entry barrier to the New York City taxi market that has in turn created a black market for illegal taxicab operation in areas underserved by medallion cabs. Because the cost of leasing a medallion is so high, the system cuts into the income of drivers and raise costs for the passengers. On the other hand, some transportation analysts contend that cities with no barriers to entry to the taxi market end up with an abundance of poorly maintained taxis. They say that a medallion system helps the city to better regulate taxis and enables the city to raise the standards of all taxis.\n\nMedallions are sold from the City at infrequent auctions, or by a medallion owner. They increased in price from around $2,500 in 1947 to $280,000 in 2004. The medallions, which could be sold for a $10 renewal fee during the 1930s, are now worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, with fleet medallions topping $1,000,000 in 2011. In 2013–2014, values were around $1 million to $1.3 million. By comparison, in 2004, a taxi driver had an average yearly gross revenue of $90,747 and a net income of $49,532. Because of the historically high prices, most medallions (and most cabs) are owned by investment companies and are leased to drivers (\"hacks\"). An investigation by \"The New York Times\" showed that investment companies and banks specializing in medallion loans engaged in predatory lending to drivers, mainly immigrants, who would be unable to repay the loans with high interest rates and exorbitant fees.\n\nAn auction was held in 2006 where 308 new medallions were sold. In the 2006 auction, 254 were designated as either hybrids taxis and 54 were designated as ADA-accessible taxis. Between November 2013 and February 2014, the city auctioned 368 new medallions, all of which was earmarked for use with a wheelchair-accessible vehicle.\n\nOver the years, many medallions once owned by individual drivers were sold to large taxi fleets. , about 18% of all taxis were owner operated, while the rest were leased; this is a decline from the 29% ownership rate in 2006. Additionally, some taxi drivers might begin their shifts by owing money to the taxi fleet companies that hire them, so they may spend a substantial amount of their day trying to earn a net profit.\n\nStarting in 2014, medallion prices dropped considerably, likely due to competition from ride-share services. , medallion prices had dropped to around $500,000 in value, with one medallion dropping to $250,000. Because of the decline in medallion prices, many taxi drivers started working for ride-sharing services instead. There was also a decrease in taxi usage: in November 2016, there were 336,737 daily trips that netted $4.98 million, a decrease from the 463,701 daily trips netting $5.17 million in November 2010. However, in mid-2016, after a five-year decline, taxi usage began to increase again. Due to this competition, medallion owners sued the city and Uber in November 2015. By 2017, the 60,000 rideshare vehicles in New York City outnumbered the city's medallion vehicles at a ratio of almost 4 to 1, and many medallion owners faced the prospect of bankruptcy or severe debt because of the low medallion prices, which few entities were willing to buy. Medallion holders had trouble making payments on the loans that they borrowed to pay for the medallions. This, in turn, led to several high-profile suicides of taxi drivers who had seen decreases in profit due to the proliferation of rideshare vehicles. In August 2018, the city voted to stop issuing new ride-share licenses for one year, as well as enacted a minimum wage for for-hire vehicle drivers. The vote was intended to regulate the for-hire vehicle industry and prevent taxi medallion prices from falling further, but Uber and Lyft criticized the restriction, stating that it would have a negative impact on commuters in the outer boroughs.\n\n\n"}

It is on the Atlantic coast, 26 miles from Sligo and 15 miles from Ballina, County Mayo. The village name derives from the Irish language term for fish (\"iasc\") and \"Iascaigh\" literally means \"abounding in fish\", due to the Easky River that lies adjacent to the village itself. Easky, as a parish, was originally called \"Imleach Iseal\". The area is a tourist destination due to its scenery and water sports. Easky is a designated area on Ireland's Wild Atlantic Way tourist route.\n\nThe parish of Easky is part of the barony of Tireragh. Tireragh is a corruption of \"Tír Fhíacrach Múaidhe\" in Irish, meaning \"the land of Fiachra of the Moy\". This tuath was founded by the Uí Fiachrach Muaidhe, who were, themselves, a branch of the Uí Fiachrach dynasty of Connachta.\n\nEasky was originally named \"Imleach Iseal/Isil\" which means the \"low imleach\", or \"low land verging on the water\". The first settlements in the area seem to have taken residence in Castletown, a townland that exists to the west of the present-day village. Geologists have become increasingly interested in the rugged coastline around Easky, as it holds fossil structures that date back for millions of years.\n\nIn John O'Donovan's textbook \"The Genealogies, Tribes and Customs of Hy-Fiachrach, commonly called O'Dowd's Country\", it is documented that a man called Maoldubh, a son of Fiachra Ealgach (the son of King Daithi), was born and bred in Easky and established a fort in the area called \"Dun Maoilduibh\".\n\nIn O'Donovan's book, Easky is also mentioned through the following reference: \"To Iasca, of the land of the white-blossomed apple-trees, Belongs the O'Mailduns of high renown.\" This is a reference to a powerful clan known – in modern parlance – as the O'Muldoons, a surname that is virtually non-existent in the area today. They held the \"mansion seat\" in Castletown and were defenders of the area at large.\n\nIn Samuel Lewis's 1837 publication of \"A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland\", Easky was described as having 6,124 inhabitants, of which 289 were in the village. Lewis noted that the village (made up of one long street) had petty sessions every fortnight and that Wednesday was market day. As well as other more ancient architectural remains, he records the \"considerable remains of the old castle of Rosslee, formerly belonging to the O'Dowds\" and another castle in the Castletown townland.\n\nLandmarks in the area include O'Dowd Castle, which was built in 1207, and became home to the O'Dowd chieftains of Tireragh (the barony of much of West Sligo). The castle was originally built for Oliver McDonnell who came to the area to marry an O'Dowd widow. Located beside Easky pier, much of the original structure of the castle has been lost over time, yet the main body of the castle remains.\nIn the centre of the village is the Old Abbey and graveyard which dates back to medieval times and remained in use until 1888. Another graveyard, Roslea Cemetery, lies to the east of the village, in the townland of Aderavoher. It was opened in 1888 and was extended in 2005.\n\nEasky Bridge bridge, built in 1847, provides access to the main village from the Sligo side of the area. It contains the Bullance stone, which is built into the bridge wall and is a symbolic drinking trough, which qualified the village to hold a \"Fair Day\". Hangings took place at the bridge in the 19th century.\n\nEasky Courthouse, opposite the local vocational school, was built circa 1870. At the start of the 20th century, the County Sligo court held its sessions here. The building was attacked during the Irish Civil War. In 2010, the Courts Service of Ireland announced that Easky Courthouse would no longer hold its monthly sessions.\n\nThe village itself has a café, a restaurant, a take-away, two pubs, two shops, gift-shop, a butcher, a hairdresser, a post-office, a pottery shop, St James's Roman Catholic church (which dates back to 1833) and St Anne's Church of Ireland (which dates back to 1820), a community centre with caravan and camping area and a History and Genealogy Centre.\n\nTo the east of the village is the local vocational school, Coláiste Iascaigh. The parish of Easky has three primary schools situated in the townlands of Rathlee, Killeenduff and Owenbeg. Another primary school is located in Easky village but has been closed since 2003. A creche now operates in this building.\n\nThe local Gaelic football club, Easkey GAA, was founded in 1888, just four years after the formation of the Gaelic Athletic Association. They were amongst the first teams to compete in the first Sligo Senior Football Championship of 1888, playing St John's in Collooney on 11 March 1888. The club was the focus of a segment of the RTÉ series \"Reeling in the Years\". In the 1986 episode, it was highlighted that the club had lost 15 players (a full team) due to emigration to Britain and the USA. The club holds five Sligo Senior Football Championship titles, last contesting the 1999 Senior-Championship final (in which they were defeated by Tourlestrane).\n\nEasky is known for its surfing areas, including two reef breaks. In 1979, the Pro/Am Surfing World Championships came to Easky. Various national surfing events continue to be held here. In 1995 the Irish Surfing Association established its headquarters in the Easky Surf and Information Centre on Main Street. The building, now known as \"Easkey House\" is located in the centre of Easky village.\n\nThe Easky River is used for kayaking and canoeing. In 2003, Easky hosted the World Surf Kayaking Championships.\n\nThere are several walking routes around the river estuary and coastline (with views of the Slieve League and Benbulbin mountains) and through the local woods in the townland of Fortland.\n\nThe writer Jack Harte was born in the Easky townland of Killeenduff, where his father was the local blacksmith.\n\nThe sculptor Fred Conlon was born and grew up in Killeenduff, Easky.\n\nThe mother of Irish playwrights Martin McDonagh (director of the film \"In Bruges\") and John Michael McDonagh (director of \"The Guard\") comes from Easky. John Michael McDonagh filmed \"Calvary\" in Easky village and the surrounding area.\n\nThe parish of Easky contains numerous localised townland names. They are (in alphabetical order): Aderavoher, Alternan Park, Ballybeg, Ballycummin, Ballymeeny, Ballymeeny (Armstrong), Ballymeeny (or Hillas or Carrownabinna), Ballymeeny (Jones), Booakaun (Browne), Bookaun (Tottenham), Bunowna, Caltragh, Carrowmacbryan, Carrownrod, Carrownrush, Carrowpadden, Castletown, Cloonagleavragh, Cloonagleavragh Park, Cooga, Curraghnagap, Easky Town, Finned, Fortland, Keadues, Killeenduff, Kilmacurkan, Lenadoon, Monereagh, Old-Grange, Owenbeg, Owenykeevaun or Tawnamaddoo, Rathlee, Rathmeel, Shannonspark East, Shannonspark West and Shraheens.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2097411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097411", "title": "Grange, County Sligo", "text": "Grange, County Sligo\n\nGrange () is a village on the N15 national primary road in County Sligo, Ireland. It is located between Benbulben mountain and the Atlantic Ocean. Streedagh, a townland near Grange, is the location of a large sandy beach, three Armada wrecks and a salt water lagoon that is an area of Special Conservation. Streedagh strand is also a surfing destination.\n\nA short distance to the north are the towns of Ballyshannon and Bundoran, a surfing and seaside resort which are both bypassed, and the villages of Tullaghan and Cliffoney. To the south are Drumcliff, burial place of poet and Nobel laureate W. B. Yeats, and Sligo town.\n\nThe old village is on the hill to the north of the present village. Grange developed on land belonging to the Cistercian monastery of Boyle in County Roscommon.\nGrange village was a stronghold of the O'Harte and O'Connor families throughout the Medieval period. The O'Hartes provided cavalry for the O'Connor Sligo Lords of Carbury-Drumcliff.\n\nA castle once stood near the center of the village. The Annals of Ireland record that in 1604 a \"‘new castle and 7 cottages were built by Hugh O’Hart in the town of Grange, Co. Sligo.’\"\n\nAfter the 1641 rebellion, the land was granted to Thomas Soden. Col. W. Wood-Martin, the Irish historian, writes that Thomas Soden was probably an officer in Col. Richard Coote's Regiment of Horse, one of the Cromwellian regiments disbanded in the County of Sligo. He adds that he received in lieu of arrears of pay, a grant of the town, townland and castle, of Grange, County Sligo. Grange is located nine miles north of the town of Sligo on the road to Bundoran. He received this grant on 13 April 1668, under the 'Act of Settlement'.\"\n\nGrange is the birthplace of Lola Montez - dancer, courtesan and mistress of King Ludwig I of Bavaria.\n\nBorn Eliza Rosanna Gilbert in Sligo, Lola caught the eye of Bavaria's King Ludwig I in 1846 by claiming to be an exotic dancer from Spain. Although married, the king took up with the girl from Grange, even making her the Duchess of Landsfeld. Bavarian citizens put up with their king's cavorting, but their patience snapped when his courtesan began meddling in state affairs. Ludwig was forced to abdicate and Lola had to flee. She never saw him again, but she remained a duchess.\n\nThree Spanish Armada transport ships - La Lavia, La Juliana and the Santa Maria de Vison - were lost off Streedagh strand in September 1588, an event commemorated by a monument close to the beach. One of the survivors, Captain Francisco de Cuéllar, recorded the events of the time in detail. He documents his shipwreck at Streedagh, the subsequent events ashore, and his attempts to find hospitality from local chieftains (O'Rourke and McClancy) in the then English garrisoned North Sligo, as he made his way back to Spain via Antrim and Scotland. \n\nIn 1985 at Streedagh Strand, marine archaeologists discovered the wreck site of the three ships of the Spanish Armada. In spring 2015, after storms sent some artifacts onto Streedagh Strand, Ireland's Department of Arts, Heritage, and the Gaeltacht sent divers to recover what the storms had uncovered. One particular find was a bronze cannon decorated with the image of Saint Matrona of Barcelona, which bears the initial \"D\" on its touchhole – the mark of the Genoese gunfounder Girardi Dorino II. Other pieces with this mark recovered from the wreck indicate that he cast most of what became La Juliana's bronze ordnance. The cannon is dated 1570, which corresponds to the date of La Juliana's construction; according to the Irish government, this puts the identity of the third wreck \"beyond doubt\".\n\nA Spanish Armada interpretive centre opened at Grange's old courthouse in 2018.\n\nIn 2012 Grange was briefly featured in the national news when someone discovered early 20th century Mills type 36 grenades at a private residence in the village. Grange then made national news in August that year when a herd of 105 sheep were stolen in one swoop. A sperm whale washed up on the shore close to Grange in 2019.\n\nThere are two schools in the village, a Roman Catholic church, and church hall, post office, and bathroom store.\n\nThe Church of Mary Immaculate combines modern with traditional elements, particularly lancet windows. It has a nave with five bays and its sacristy is in the corner, north-east. Its roof is pyramidal and has a carved limestone cross set above an ashlar limestone bell-cot with chamfered podium within whose pointed arch opening is the bell.\n\nNorth Sligo Sports Complex is located in the village. The complex has an indoor soccer pitch, also used for badminton and basketball. There is a squash court, racquetball court and changing room facilities and meeting room in the complex. Outside the complex, there is a running track, where North Sligo Athletic Club meet (as well as at Oxfield Sports Centre), a grass soccer pitch and an all-weather soccer pitch. There was also a community park, now converted to a playground. At the north end of the village is a pitch, Molaise Park, where local Gaelic football teams train and play. The local GAA club celebrated its centenary in 2007.\n\n\n\n"}

The rise of American military strength during their Civil War concerned Canada. The government authorized formation of militia regiments. Each of six Montreal Scottish chieftains responded by raising an infantry company for the 5th Battalion. Eventually, eight companies were raised. Since then, thousands of Canadian citizens have served in the Black Watch. In addition to service during the Fenian raids, they have fought in the Great War and the Second World War; bolstered NATO operations in Europe and UN peacekeeping worldwide; and helped their fellow Canadians at home during the 1998 Ice Storm (Operation ASSISTANCE) and 2011, 2017, and 2019 flooding in Quebec (Operation LENTUS).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 5th Battalion, The Royal Light Infantry of Canada, was called out on active service on 8 March 1866 and served on the South-Eastern frontier until it was removed from active service on 31 March 1866.

These details were disbanded on 31 December 1940.\n\nThe regiment mobilized the 1st Battalion, The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada, CASF, on 1 September 1939. This unit, which served in Newfoundland from 22 June to 11 August 1940, embarked for Great Britain on 25 August 1940. Three platoons took part in the raid on Dieppe on 19 August 1942. On 6 July 1944, the battalion landed in France as part of the 5th Infantry Brigade, 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, and it continued to fight in North West Europe until the end of the war. The overseas battalion was disbanded on 30 November 1945.\n\nThe regiment subsequently mobilized the 2nd Battalion, The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada, CASF, on 18 March 1942. This unit served in Canada in a home defence role as part of Atlantic Command until it was disbanded on 15 August 1943.\n\nThe 1st Battalion, Black Watch was brigaded with Le Régiment de Maisonneuve and Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal of the Second Canadian Division; however the FMR were replaced with The Calgary Highlanders in the 5th Brigade in 1940.\n\nThe 1st Battalion suffered more casualties than any other Canadian infantry battalion in Northwest Europe according to figures published in \"The Long Left Flank\" by Jeffrey Williams.

It has, over the years, been consistently ranked among the top Canadian Forces bands in all rated categories. It is officially part of the Black Watch. It is currently located in Montreal. The Pipe Major is currently Adam Wilson and the Drum Major is Hugues Vanden Abeele. It is a descendant of the 42nd Battalion Royal Highlanders of Canada Pipes and Drums, which was active during the First World War.\n\nThe Pipes and Drums have appeared at many events over the years, with appearances including \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", military tattoos and highland games throughout North America (including games in Fort Ticonderoga, Miami, and the Stone Mountain Highland Games and Tattoo near Atlanta). The Black Watch have played at the United States Bicentennial in 1976 and for the Trooping of the Colour in London. It was the only foreign band to march in the parade celebrating the Bicentennial of the American Constitution and was one of many bands at the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother's 90th and 100th Birthday celebrations on Horse Guards Parade.\n\nAs members of a royal regiment, the pipers wear the Royal Stewart tartan, which is the tartan of the current monarch.The regimental drummers wear the Government tartan, which came to be known as the Black Watch tartan due to its dark hue. \n\n\n\"Gallant Black Watch\", a Scotch style march and two-step, was composed by Bert L.

He was the New Democratic Party (NDP) Member of Parliament (MP) for the riding of Ottawa Centre.\n\nDewar was first elected to the House of Commons in the 2006 federal election. He served as the Official Opposition Critic for Foreign Affairs, until he left the post in October 2011 to run for the leadership of the NDP. Dewar lost his seat during the 2015 federal election which saw the NDP lose all of its seats in Eastern Ontario. Before entering politics he worked as a teacher and was an elected representative of the Ottawa-Carleton Elementary Teachers' Federation.\n\nDewar was born in Ottawa, Ontario, on January 25, 1963, to parents Ken Dewar and former Ottawa mayor and New Democratic Member of Parliament, Marion Dewar. When he was in grade three, Dewar was diagnosed with dyslexia, after his teacher noticed that he was struggling to read and write. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Carleton University in political science and economics in 1985.\n\nNot long after he completed his Bachelor of Arts, Dewar embarked on a five-month trip to Nicaragua, where he volunteered as an aid worker. Following his return to Ottawa, he began working as constituency assistant to Ontario Minister of Health and NDP Member of Provincial Parliament for Ottawa Centre, Evelyn Gigantes. Dewar served in this position from 1990 to 1995. It was during this time that he met his wife, Julia Sneyd. They later had two children together: Nathaniel and Jordan.\n\nDewar attained a Bachelor of Education degree from Queen's University in 1994. He went on to work as an elementary school teacher at D. Roy Kennedy Public School and as an English teacher at Hopewell Avenue Public School. His work with students with special needs led Queen's University to award him the \"A. Lorne Cassidy Award\".\n\nWhile working at the schools, Dewar became involved with his union, the Ottawa-Carleton Elementary Teachers' Federation (OCETF; a local of the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario). After having served as a member of OCETF Executive and as the chair of their political action committee, he was elected Second Vice-President in 2001 and First Vice-President in 2004. During his time with the union, Dewar played a major role in reviving the OCETF's political action committee and in establishing the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario's Humanity Fund, which provides financial support to various charities doing work in developing countries, such as the Stephen Lewis Foundation. He took a leave of absence from his position with the OCETF in 2006 to run in that year's federal election.\n\nIn 2002, Dewar organized a Community Forum on Public Education. He has also been actively involved with the Coalition for a Healthy Ottawa, the Partnership for a Pesticide Bylaw, the Old Ottawa East Community Association, and Fair Vote Canada, and he has served on the board of directors of the Ottawa Community Immigrant Services Organization.\n\nDewar was raised in a Catholic household, but he took issue with the church's positions on same-sex marriage, birth control, and women's rights. He became active with the First United Church from 2001 onward.\n\nOn February 14, 2018, Dewar underwent surgery for a brain tumour. He was subsequently diagnosed with grade 4 glioblastoma. Dewar died from his illness on February 6, 2019.\n\nDewar ran for the New Democratic nomination in Ottawa Centre for the 2004 federal election. Several weeks after Dewar started his campaign, former NDP leader Ed Broadbent came out of retirement to also seek the nomination. After Broadbent won, Dewar went on to volunteer for Broadbent's successful campaign in the general election, playing a major role in organizing the NDP election day effort.\n\nIn order to care for his ailing wife, Broadbent decided not to seek re-election. Dewar won the proceeding nomination contest on June 22, 2005 on the first ballot, defeating NDP caucus Research and Communications Director Jamey Heath, who was the riding's candidate in the 1997 election, lawyer and film producer Tiffani Murray, and \"Ottawa Citizen\" automotive columnist Shannon Lee Mannion.\n\nDewar won the 2006 election and became an MP.\n\nDewar was acclaimed on February 12, 2007 as the New Democrats' candidate for the 2008 federal election. He was re-elected on October 14, 2008, by a substantial margin over his closest challenger, Penny Collenette of the Liberal Party.\n\nBeginning February 5, 2009, Dewar served as the Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for the Prevention of Genocide and Other Crimes Against Humanity.\n\nIn April 2009, Dewar reintroduced legislation to protect Gatineau Park. If passed the act would have provided legislated boundaries for the park, prevented removal of land from the park, created a mechanism for expanding the park, and mandated the National Capital Commission to acquire private lands in the park through a right of first refusal process. However, he was later criticized in the media for having abandoned his commitments on the park, for supporting the Conservative government's legislation, and for not attending the committee studying that legislation.\n\nDewar was re-elected in the 2011 federal election, winning 52% of the popular vote. The NDP formed the Official Opposition following the election and Dewar was named the Critic for Foreign Affairs. While acting as foreign affairs critic, Dewar took a position in favour of the UN Arms Trade Treaty not exempting weapons designed for sport or hunting, an exemption that the Canadian government was proposing at international talks. Dewar explained in media interviews that in his view it was important that the UN treaty cover all small arms because of the effects that they have had in conflicts in Africa.\n\nDewar criticized the government's decision to close its embassy in Iran, saying it was \"bad diplomacy\".\n\nDewar was one of thirteen Canadians banned from traveling to Russia under retaliatory sanctions imposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in March 2014.\n\nDewar was defeated in the 2015 federal election by Liberal candidate Catherine McKenna.\n\nFollowing the death of Jack Layton in August 2011, Dewar was seen as a potential candidate to succeed him as leader. On October 2, 2011, Dewar announced his candidacy for the leadership of the New Democratic Party. Dewar was considered to be among the leading candidates in the seven-person race; however, his lack of fluency in French was seen as a major obstacle. While internal polling released by his campaign showed he was among the top three candidates and had strong growth potential, on election day he finished fifth out of seven candidates on the first ballot with 7.5% of the vote. Following the first ballot, he withdrew his candidacy and did not endorse any other candidates.\n\n"}

Great Lakes Airlines was the only other carrier at Sheridan but this carrier abruptly ceased all flights on March 31, 2015. Many Sheridan residents were confused regarding the lack of replacement service, believing that service to Sheridan was still subsidized under Essential Air Service. Federal law had been changed in 2012 so that once Sheridan County had left the EAS program, it could not re-enter it and commercial air service to Sheridan is not funded by EAS anymore.\n\nFederal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 17,710 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 14,181 in 2009 and 14,146 in 2010.

It is a holiday destination with a skyline dominated by Ben Bulben mountain. It is in the barony of Carbury and parish of Ahamlish.\n\nFrom the 17th to the 19th centuries it was part of the large estate belonging to the Temple family in north Sligo. The land, some 12,000 acres, was granted to Sir John Temple, 1st Viscount Palmerston and Master of the Rolls in Dublin. The 3rd Viscount, Henry John Temple, better known as Lord Palmerston, began the building of the castle of Classiebawn, a baronial-style house standing on the peninsula. He also built the stone-walled harbour in the village, which was designed by the marine engineer Alexander Nimmo. It was built between 1822 and 1841.\n\nThe Temples were mostly absentee landlords, with the estate being run initially by middlemen, and later by land agents, such as Stewart and Kincaid, a Dublin firm with offices in Sligo. These agents, in their attempts to make the estates profitable, oversaw the \"assisted emigration\" that took place on the Palmerston and adjacent Gore Booth (Lissadell) estate that began before the famine and continued until at least the 1860s.\n\nThus, in May 1862, a Sligo newspaper reported: \"In accordance with a custom of some years' standing, about sixty persons have been selected for emigration from the Parish of Ahamlish ... whose passages and outfit has been provided by his Lordship. They consist of twenty-four young girls, and twenty young men ... [and] families who were wholly unable to support themselves ... who had asked the favour of being sent out ... The emigrants took their passages ... this day, for Liverpool, en route for America.\"\nLord Palmerston presided over Mullaghmore and North Sligo during the worst years of the Irish Potato famine, the great famine of the mid-19th century. During the summer and autumn of 1847, nine vessels, carrying over 2,000 persons left Sligo port with tenants evicted and \"shovelled out\" from his Sligo estates. They arrived in Canada half naked and totally destitute. The city of St. John in the Canadian province of New Brunswick had to take many of Palmerston's evicted tenants into care and, outraged, sent a scathing letter to Palmerston expressing regret and fury that he or his agents, ‘should have exposed such a numerous and distressed portion of his tenantry to the severity and privation of a New Brunswick winter ... unprovided with the common means of support, with broken down constitutions and almost in a state of nudity ... without regard to humanity or even common decency.’ The graves of many of these unfortunate victims can be seen today on the old quarantine station, now a museum, at Grosse Ille near Quebec. \n\nClassiebawn was a favoured holiday retreat of Admiral of the Fleet Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, the last Viceroy of India, who had inherited Classiebawn Castle. It was off the Mullaghmore coast in August 1979 that Lord Mountbatten, along with his fourteen-year-old grandson Nicholas Knatchbull, The Dowager Baroness Brabourne and County Fermanagh teenager Paul Maxwell, were killed by a bomb planted by the Provisional IRA.\n\nIn 2007 it hosted the final stage of Rally Ireland.\n\nMullaghmore is a big wave surfing destination. On 8 March 2012, surfers and windsurfers from all over the world rode waves up to high off Mullaghmore Head. These waves were about five metres less than the tallest wave ever recorded in Ireland in County Donegal on 13 December 2011, which was high.\nThe waves in Mullaghmore were generated by a complex weather system nicknamed the \"Viking storm\" leading to big wave conditions in the area for the month of March for 15 years. Some riders suffered bruising as well as broken bones and surf boards.\n\nA North American low-pressure system moved east and combined with another cyclone in the Western Atlantic. This system moved into an area off the coast of Ireland that already had high waves owing to a series of strong systems the previous week. In addition, a strong anticyclone over the Azores created a large pressure gradient in the North Atlantic that directed a strong fetch towards Ireland. There was also an extended fetch length in the North Atlantic in the direction of Europe while the swell was created. These combined conditions produced waves that were confirmed by satellite data on 7 March 2012 to have exceeded in height.\n\nThe nearest bus stop to Mullaghmore is located at Cliffoney around distant and is served several times a day by Bus Éireann local and Expressway services.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2097457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097457", "title": "Trümmerfilm", "text": "Trümmerfilm\n\nTrümmerfilm () was an aesthetic choice for those films made directly after World War II dealing with the impact of the battles in the countries at the center of the war. The style was mostly used by filmmakers in the rebuilding film industries of Eastern Europe, Italy and the former Nazi Germany. The style is characterized by its use of location exteriors among the \"rubble\" of bombed-down cities to bring the gritty, depressing reality of the lives of the civilian survivors in those early years.\n\nThe following are notable Trümmerfilm:\n\n\"A Foreign Affair\" (1948), \"The Search\" (1948) and \"The Third Man\" (1949) are examples of Hollywood films of the same period with European directors which made innovative use of location shooting of German and Austrian rubble.\n\n\nThe desolation left as a consequence of the bombing that Germany endured before the end of World War II left the major German cities in shambles. However, unlike other cities, Berlin's structures had steel frames. This enabled many of them to remain standing, despite the bombings. This left jagged figures on the landscape, as well as a lot of rubble on the ground. Often, directors would have either horizontal or vertical shots of the rubble from a low angle.\n\"The Murderers Are Among Us\" begins with a ground shot facing upwards showing a Berlin street, complete with piles of rubble, and destroyed buildings. The viewer sees several children running around, and the protagonist ambling up the street. The viewer also sees German citizens working together to clean up, and getting on with their lives, despite the devastation. Critics have observed similarities between the rubble film aesthetic and Weimar era Expressionism, as well as Romanticism. These features include gloomy environments, canted angles and chiaroscuro lighting, along with morally ambiguous protagonists. It has been argued by Gertrud Koch that, aside from the expressionist and neorealistic qualities of the Rubble Film, a major purpose of these films was to re-invigorate the German people, and instill a work ethic that would facilitate the reconstruction of Germany.\n\nIn the year after the war ended, no films were made. This one-year period is referred to as the Filmpause, and is due in large part to the destruction or seizure of Germany's film studios, as well as artistic uncertainty. Furthermore, people had little interest in seeing films, much less the facilities with which to do so. This uncertainty was caused by Hitler's delegitimization of conventional filmmaking practices, which forced filmmakers to reinvent their filmography methods, and film content. It would not be until Wolfgang Staudte released \"The Murderers Are Among Us\" in 1946 that German Cinema began to further develop.\n\nOriginally, the name \"Trümmerfilm\" held negative connotation. These films were seen as a symbol of defeat and desolation. They symbolized the control that the German Nazis had over the German people, as well as the success of the Allies in destroying their country. Instead of offering a nostalgic attachment to what Germany was, it simply was a mark of trauma and despair. The German identity had been stripped by the Nazi party, and they felt that these films did little more than re-affirm the horrors that Germany suffered.\n\nThe genre has also received criticism for its whitewashing of Nazi history. In the film \"The Murderers Are Among Us\", the female protagonist Susanne returns from a concentration camp and is shocked by the misery of Germans in the cities. A common trope in the rubble films is the highlighting of German soldiers' trauma at the expense of relegating the suffering of political and racial enemies of the Third Reich. The dwelling on wartime trauma is not in itself a cause for concern. But the omission of any depictions of Nazi violence, in a genre so consumed with expressing suffering, is a criticized feature of the Heimkehrerfilm.\n"}

Located in the southeastern suburb of Rome, the university combines a liberal arts tradition with emphasis on career orientation in the field of Economics, Engineering, Sciences and Medicine. Many professors of the university are important members of the Italian cultural and political environment.\n\nThe university takes its name from the 14th-century farmhouse \"Turris Virgatae\" that was owned by the Roman noble family of Annibaldi, whose remains lie beneath Villa Gentile on campus.\n\nThe university occupies a area outside the Grande Raccordo Anulare highway connection, in the eastern sector of the city. One of the most modern University Hospitals in Italy (Tor Vergata Polyclinic), with state-of-the-art medical equipment, is located on campus. The university hospital is well equipped with diagnostic and therapeutic vanguard structures and is considered a flagship hospital at national and international levels. \nNear the university, there are accommodation facilities owned by the regional organization as well as Campus X, a private company, considered the largest in Italy, providing 1500 bed spaces, starting from March 2011\n\nThe innovative City of Sport project, designed by the internationally renowned Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava was an integral part of the city of Rome's bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics and would have hosted the volleyball, gymnastics, trampoline, and basketball finals. On February 14, 2012, the Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti called an end to the bid, citing uncertain costs and unknown financial benefit. The announcement came a day before the deadline for applicant cities to submit the application files. The project would have transformed the area of south-east of Rome. The two main buildings of the project the Sport Forum and Swimming Forum are symmetrical; each of them is about in area and about 75 m in height. The complex, whose construction began in April 2007, was to be completed in 2009 in time for the 2009 World Aquatics Championships but is still under construction. The new university tower, located on the opposite side of the road with respect to the City of Sport project, will rise to about 90 meters, whose penultimate floor would host the new administrative office of Tor Vergata, while the top floor would host a wide lobby that would offer panoramic views. The lower floors would welcome other offices. The layer below the tower would accommodate underground parking.\n\nThe university is divided into six schools: Economics, Engineering, Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, Law, Medicine and Sciences. There are 19 departments; combined, they offer 31 PhD programmes and 120 Masters programmes. The university offers 114 undergraduate degree programs (three-year degree, single-cycle), 9 of which are taught in English. The university has taken concrete steps in the past years to participate in international projects and to link industries to its research. It also participates in interdisciplinary dialogue with local businesses to provide support to entrepreneurial activities and small businesses. In 2016, the University is ranked among top 10 universities in Italy.\n\nThe Faculty of Economics in Tor Vergata has been consistently ranked among the top 3 economics departments by La Repubblica newspaper's annual ranking of economic faculties in Italy and currently holds the top spot nationally and 93rd worldwide. The school is particularly strong in the field of business, financial economics.\n\nFounded in 1987, The Centre of Economic and International Studies (CEIS) is an internationally recognized research centre within the Faculty of Economics at the University of Rome, Tor Vergata. CEIS is engaged in creating and supporting international research and higher-learning networking in the major fields of economics. CEIS hosts numerous seminars and conferences bringing together leading economists and experts in academia and government.\n\nResearch is carried out in 27 departmental and inter-departmental research centers. On campus there are also other major research institutions. The new main headquarters of the Italian Space Agency was inaugurated in Tor Vergata on July 25, 2012. Other important national centres include the Tor Vergata research establishment of National Research Council and the National Institute for Astrophysics. The close proximity and research ties with other distinguished research centers that are near campus, such as the Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Environment (ENEA), the European Space Agency Center for Earth Observation and the Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics makes Tor Vergata a unique research environment and one of the most dynamic aggregations in the country. The University scientifically supports the UNESCO-Merck Africa Research Summit, together with the University of Cambridge and the Institut Pasteur.\n\n\n"}

The old name appears to be Ros Dragnige (see Killaspugbrone).\n\nIt is suggested the development of Strandhill can be attributed to a Benjamin Murrow who purchased the undeveloped land from the upper road in 1895 for £1,760. He constructed a roadway to the sea for £1000, and offered plots either side of the roadway, which he named Buenos Ayres Drive. In 1912 he constructed a bathhouse to attract visitors. Buenos Ayres drive was conveyed into public ownership in 1928, and the strip of land to the shore in 1936.\n\nStrandhill is situated at the western base of Knocknarea on the Cúil Irra (Coolera) peninsula in Sligo Bay, 5 miles west of Sligo town, and faces the Atlantic Ocean. Although the main part of the village lies within the townland of Strandhill, it also extends into the townlands of Killaspugbrone and Carrowbunnaun. The area is well known for surfing.\n\nStrandhill's surrounding areas include the mountain of Knocknarea, Coney Island, Culleenamore beach, and Dorrins Strand. Much of the terrain consists of marram-covered dunes, and the local council has had to undertake various measures throughout the years to combat coastal erosion.\n\nStrandhill has a caravan park, pubs, restaurants/cafes, St Asicus National School, St Patrick's Church, St Annes Church of Ireland and the Strandhill surgery. The village has multiple hostels, the Ocean Wave Lodge, The Dunes Tavern and SurfnStay Lodge and Hostel. There is also the Strandhill Lodge and Suites, awarded by Tripadvisor as the third best hotel in Ireland and 13th in the world. The resort has a seaweed bath.\n\nStrandhill is a vast beach break capable of holding huge waves in the right conditions. Surfing is usually best when the tide is on the push in from mid to high tide. \n\nWhile Strandhill's beach is renowned for surfing, it is not safe for swimming. The nearby strand at Culleenamore is suitable for paddling.\n\nStrandhill has a soccer club named Strand Celtic and Sligo Rugby Football Club is based in Hamilton Park, where tag rugby is also played. Coolera/Strandhill GAA club involves Strandhill and the neighbouring parish of Ransboro, and also field a hurling team.\n\nThe local 18-hole golf course has been described as having \"undulating fairways and unforgiving short cuts\".\n\nDolly's Cottage, a 200-year-old traditional thatched cottage, is open to the public.\n\nThe Klaus Gundchen sculpture on a plinth at the entrance to the beach was removed by the council on 22 February 2016.\n\nThe Strandhill Peoples Market takes place at Sligo airport every Sunday. The market has stalls selling locally produced foods, textiles, and crafts. It has been nominated for the best new business in Sligo Leader Business Awards 2015 and also nominated for the best start up in the IBYE awards.\n\nThe Culleenamore Races is an annual beach pony and horseracing event dating from the 1800s that takes place early in the summer\n\nThe Warriors Run, a 15k race held annually since 1985, takes participants from the beach front in Strandhill around and then up the nearby Knocknarea mountain, to the cairn at the top, and back again, as music and festivities takes over the town.\n\nThe annual Strandhill Guitar Festival is held in late September.\n\nStrandhill is the site of Sligo Airport, which opened in 1983.

Gelsinger suffered from ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, an X-linked genetic disease of the liver, the symptoms of which include an inability to metabolize ammonia – a byproduct of protein breakdown. The disease is usually fatal at birth, but Gelsinger had a milder form of the disease, in which the ornithine transcarbamylase gene is mutated in only part of the patient's cells, a condition known as somatic mosaicism. As his deficiency was partial, Gelsinger managed to survive on a restricted diet and special medications.\n\nGelsinger joined a clinical trial run by the University of Pennsylvania that aimed at developing a treatment for infants born with the severe form of the disease. On September 13, 1999, Gelsinger was injected with an adenoviral vector carrying a corrected gene to test the safety of the procedure. He died four days later at the age of 18, on September 17, apparently having suffered a massive immune response triggered by the use of the viral vector to transport the gene into his cells, leading to multiple organ failure and brain death.\n\nA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigation concluded that the scientists involved in the trial, including the co-investigator James Wilson (Director of the Institute for Human Gene Therapy), broke several rules of conduct:\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania later issued a rebuttal, but the university and Children's National Medical Center each agreed to pay more than $500,000 to the government. Both Wilson and the University are reported to have had financial stakes in the research. The Gelsinger case was a severe setback for scientists working in the field and a tragic reminder of the risks involved. \n\n"}
{"id": "2097490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097490", "title": "Fearless (novel series)", "text": "Fearless (novel series)\n\nFearless is a series of teen novels written by American author Francine Pascal, creator of the \"Sweet Valley High\" franchise. The first book in the series, \"Fearless\", was published in 1999 through Simon Pulse and concluded in 2004 with the 36th entry, \"Gone\". A spinoff series, \"Fearless FBI\" was launched in 2005. The first book in the primary series, \"Fearless\", was named one of YALSA's \"Quick Picks for Reluctant Young Adult Readers\" for 2001.\n\nThe series takes place in the 1990s and focuses on Gaia Moore, a seventeen-year-old girl who is incapable of feeling fear. \"Fearless\" focuses predominantly on Gaia's interactions and relationships with the people around her, as well as her search for an explanation for her condition and her struggle to feel like a normal teenager. The series is told primarily in three story arcs, each of which has its own primary antagonist, and concludes with Gaia graduating from high school.\n\nGaia has had past strife in her family as a result of a love triangle between Gaia's mother (Katia) and the twin siblings Tom and Oliver Moore. Katia ultimately rejected Oliver and he then became obsessed with her. Katia eventually married Tom, but on the night of the wedding Oliver pretended to be Tom and raped Katia. She eventually conceived Gaia with Tom, only for Oliver to believe that Gaia is his daughter. This is later revealed to be untrue, as Oliver had become sterile due to a life saving medical operation he received as a child, which also contributed to his unstable mental status.\n\nOliver spent many years evading the CIA but was eventually caught by Katia's father, a Russian terrorist named Yuri. Yuri contained Oliver, who eventually overtook Yuri's organization and became its leader, adopting the moniker of Loki. He would later try to connect with Gaia by visiting her under the guise of being her father Tom and teaching her martial arts. This confused Gaia, who eventually rejected Oliver. Oliver's actions were eventually detected by Tom and Oliver went into hiding once again. It was during this time that Gaia began to show a lack of fear, which was eventually confirmed by CIA testing that proclaimed her genetically unable to experience fear for herself.\n\nOliver did not re-emerge in Gaia's life until she was twelve, when he tried to assassinate Tom but instead killed Katia by accident. This spurred Tom to essentially abandon Gaia in hopes of sparing her from Oliver's attentions, which would embitter her towards her father and cause her to become emotionally withdrawn and antisocial. Gaia spent the remainder of her childhood in several abusive foster homes.\n\nThe first story arc shows Oliver \"Loki\" Moore (the leader of a Russian terrorist organization), trying to regain Gaia's trust due to his mistaken belief that she is his daughter. He uses several extreme methods to get close to her and issues commands for his agents to track her movements, which continues throughout the entire series. This endangers not only Gaia, but the people around her, as she has recently begun her Junior year at a New York City high school. She makes several friends, including the paraplegic Ed Fargo and the college student Sam, whom Gaia has a crush on. Her crush is made complicated by the fact Sam is dating Gaia's rival and bitter school enemy: Heather.\n\nLoki attempts to isolate Gaia by kidnapping or killing anyone close to her, which results in the kidnapping of Sam. Gaia manages to rescue Sam from Loki's operatives, but is unable to save her best friend Mary or her foster mother Ella from Loki's schemes; Mary is assassinated and Ella (a secret operative for Loki) sacrifices herself for Gaia. Heather breaks up with Sam and begins dating Ed, but dumps him shortly after her older sister Phoebe goes to rehab for anorexia nervosa. Gaia begins to date Sam, but the relationship is constantly strained by stress placed upon Sam from his college dormitory RA Josh (who works for Loki) and is later ended completely with Sam's apparent death. Things are further complicated when it is revealed that Josh is one of four clones created by Loki. One of the clones befriends and becomes infatuated with Heather, giving her a \"fearless serum\" created by Loki (based off research from Gaia's genome). Unexpectedly, this causes Heather to go blind.\n\nDuring this time Ed undergoes a surgery that corrects his paraplegia and Gaia manages to befriend Heather after rescuing her from a murder attempt. The characters of Natasha and Tatiana (a Russian mother and daughter), are introduced into the series and move in with Tom (Gaia's biological father) and Gaia. Eventually Gaia begins to date Ed and the two form a romantic and sexual relationship together, but they become distant after Ed is almost killed by an assassin - Gaia realizes anyone she gets close to is vulnerable to assault or death.\n\nLoki realizes he will never gain Gaia's full trust after she rejects his proposal to collaborate with him and inherit his criminal organization. His attempts to clone Gaia and create a successful fearless serum fail. After a deadly confrontation between the Josh clones, Loki, Tom and Gaia; Loki attempts to take the fearless serum, but falls into a coma. The story arc concludes with Tom also falling into a coma after partaking in a celebratory dinner with Gaia, Ed, Natasha and Tatiana. Tom goes missing from the hospital shortly after and is presumed to have been captured by a mysterious organization operating out of Loki's control.\n\nIn the second arc it is revealed that Gaia's ex-boyfriend Sam is not dead, but was held hostage for several months in Loki's terrorist compound; which has become abandoned. Upon being freed, Sam and Gaia reunite and return to the compound; in hopes of finding a clue to her missing father Tom's location. Their search leads them to rescue an old prisoner named \"Dmitri\". During their travel back to New York, Sam discovers that Gaia is dating Ed; which wounds him emotionally.\n\nThroughout this time several assassination attempts are made upon Gaia's life, which makes Gaia suspicious of Sam and causes her to suspect he was (brainwashed) into becoming her enemy. The assassination attempts are eventually revealed to be the work of Tatiana and Natasha; who work for an organization that is outside of Loki's control. It is revealed that the prisoner found in Loki's compound is actually Gaia's grandfather Yuri: the original leader and founder of the Russian criminal syndicate that Loki controls. Gaia's status as heir of her grandfather's criminal organization jeopardized Natasha and Tatiana's inheritance (both of which are cousins of Gaia's mother); prompting them to seek out and attempt to assassinate Gaia. Both women are eventually captured in traps set up by FBI agents, Jake (a charismatic new transfer student) and Gaia.\n\nWith help from Loki (who awakened from his coma), Gaia discovers that her father is in Siberia. She leaves for Siberia with Jake and Loki. Loki's personality has greatly been changed from the coma; leaving him as a benevolent and thoughtful person with regrets for his past crimes and actions. The group eventually succeeds in not only rescuing Tom, but also capturing Yuri. The success of the operation prompts Gaia to begin a relationship with Jake, who had been romantically pursuing her throughout this arc. Gaia is left with the hope that her troubles will finally be over.\n\nThe final story arc introduces the Rodke family, a wealthy family that owns a well-known global pharmaceutical company. Gaia befriends the youngest two Rodke siblings, Liz and her twin brother Chris after they transfer to the high school. During this time a mysterious drug dealer known only by the alias \"God\" begins introducing a new street drug called \"Invince\" to the New York areas. The drug causes users to feel invincible and fearless with extreme aggression and rage. While not the same drug; it greatly resembles the one created by Oliver while he was 'Loki'. The distribution of Invince causes crime and assaults to greatly increase throughout the city.\n\nMeanwhile Gaia becomes the target of a series of attacks from unknown assailants, which her uncle Oliver and recent boyfriend Jake begin to investigate. Gaia approaches the geneticist Dr. Ulrich, an employee for Rodke Pharmaceuticals, with the hope of finding a cure for her fearless condition. Dr. Ulrich tells Gaia that he can cure her by way of a surgical procedure, which proves to ultimately be successful. This is confirmed when later on Gaia flees in terror from a group of Invince drug addicts instead of fighting them. Her relief and happiness at finally being \"normal\" leads to conflicted emotions when she discovers that the invince addicts she ran from assaulted her ex boyfriend Ed and his new girlfriend Kai; leaving them both with lifelong scars. Gaia's new fearful disposition leaves her susceptible to psychological manipulation from Skylar Rodke, the eldest brother of the Rodke's. He emotionally manipulates Gaia into staying at his apartment for several days and skipping high schoolprom, which strains her relationship with Jake. Meanwhile Sam and Heather begin to date again, as Heather has a full recovery from her blindness and regains her eyesight. Ed falls in love with Kai while remaining bitter towards Gaia about their failed relationship.\n\nJake discovers that Chris Rodke is the mysterious drug dealer selling Invince; this in turn results in Chris issuing a city wide order for all Invince users to kill Jake. Jake barely survives an attempt on his life with assistance from Gaia. It is ultimately revealed that Chris was forced to distribute Invince illegally under his fathers orders to show military research contractors the potential military advantages and biological effects using Invince cause. It's also implied that Chris's father greatly resents him for being gay and the \"weaker\" sibling compared to his older brother, Skylar. The military contractors, who had expressed interest in purchasing Invince decide to end their contract after seeing data and evidence the Rodkes have amassed from the citywide Invince users.\n\nTo Gaia's surprise she finds out Dr. Ulrich lied about the effectiveness of her surgery - the effects begin to wear off, leaving her in a fearless state once again. She overhears a plan that the Rodkes are going to kill and dissect her in order to examine her DNA for the source of her condition, but ultimately fails to escape Skylar and the Rodke's clutches. She's saved from certain death by the arrival of her family (Tom, Oliver) and her boyfriend Jake. Chris (who at this point has had a change of heart) appears and informs his brother that he's called the police and they are on their way to make arrests, which prompts the two rival siblings to try killing each other. In the process Chris tries to shoot Gaia, who is saved when Jake shields her: taking the bullet meant for her. As a result: Jake bleeds to death from a gunshot wound to the chest; leaving the police with plenty of evidence to arrest both Rodke brothers and their father, whom eventually confess to all the corruptions and crimes of the Rodke company. Oliver vows never to become Loki again, as he recognizes similarities in the sibling rivalry between Chris and Skyler with Tom and himself. Gaia is emotionally destroyed by Jake's death and overwhelmed from all the violence and destruction she's had to face over the years in the city. She decides to run away and leaves New York forever.\n\n\n\n\nColumbia TriStar Television optioned the television rights for \"Fearless\" in 1999 and a pilot episode was filmed for The WB for the Fall 2003 television season. The series would have starred Rachael Leigh Cook as Gaia, who would now be a 23-year-old field agent for the FBI. The show was never aired, as producer Jerry Bruckheimer pulled the show due to various concerns and the time slot was later filled with \"One Tree Hill\". Warren Ellis later reviewed the pilot episode and criticized it as \"too unfocussed [sic] to make consistently engaging television, and I think it's the wrong composition of concepts to hook the young audience I assume they're playing for.\"\n\nIn June 2005 a spinoff series entitled \"Fearless FBI\" was launched. The series describes Gaia's post-college life, where she decides to join the FBI as opposed to the CIA, the organization her father belongs to. Gaia forms a working relationship and friendship with her partner Catherine Sanders, as well as a romantic relationship with Will Taylor.\n\nThe series currently only has four books and the series was left unfinished as of \"Naked Eye\", the fourth book in the series.\n"}

It is located at the town of Fengqiao (lit. Maple Bridge), about 5 kilometers west of Suzhou's old city.\n\nTraditionally, Hanshan Temple is believed to have been founded during the Tianjian era (502–519) of the reign of Emperor Wu of Liang, in the Southern and Northern Dynasties period. The current name of the monastery derives from Hanshan, the legendary monk and poet. Hanshan and his disciple Shide are said to have come to the monastery during the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang (627–649), where Hanshan became the abbot.\n\nHanshan Temple is famed in East Asia because of the poem \"A Night Mooring by Maple Bridge\" (楓橋夜泊), by Tang Dynasty poet, Zhang Ji. The poem describes the melancholy scene of a dejected traveller, moored at night at Fengqiao, hearing the bells of Hanshan Temple:\n\n月落烏啼霜滿天，\n江楓漁火對愁眠。\n姑蘇城外寒山寺，\n夜半鐘聲到客船。\nYuè luò wū tí shuāng mǎn tiān, \nJiāng fēng yú huǒ duì chóu mián. \nGūsū chéngwài Hánshān Sì, \nYèbàn zhōngshēng dào kèchuán.\n\nThe moon is going down\nAnd the crows make a ruckus\nThe sky is covered with frost\nThere are maples on the riverbank\nAnd the lights of fishing boats\nDrift with the current\nI fall into a sad sleep\nfrom the monastery on Cold Mountain\nThe sound of the bell\nReaches the guest boat at midnight\n\nThe poem is still popularly read in China, Japan and Korea. It is part of the primary school curriculum in both China and Japan. The ringing of the bell at Hanshan Temple on Chinese New Year eve is a major pilgrimage and tourism event for visitors from these countries.\n\nTwo bells are currently used at Hanshan Temple, both dating from the late Qing Dynasty when the temple was last rebuilt. One was forged in China in 1906, and the other was forged in Japan at around the same time. The dedication on the bell was written by Japanese Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi. The original Tang Dynasty bell is believed by some (including Itō Hirobumi and modern Chinese statesman Kang Youwei) to have been taken to Japan in ancient times. These two factors have roused some nationalistic controversy among Chinese and Koreans (see, for example, this opinion).\n\nA new 108 tonne bell commissioned by Hanshan Temple and produced by a foundry in Wuhan was completed in 2007 in order to replace the hundred years old Japanese bell. The new bell is 8.5 metres high and 5.2 metres in diameter at its widest. It is engraved with 70094 Chinese characters from Lotus Sutra.\n\nA Hanshan Temple (pronounced \"kanzan-ji\" in Japanese) was established in Ōme, Tokyo, Japan in 1929\n\n"}

It operated a chain of stores, with 170 outlets across 14 states. It specialized in products such as shrubs, trees, accent plants, flowers, and lawn furniture.\n\nIn 1942, Frank Sherr and his nephew-in-law, Max Weinberg, opened a food market, known as Frank's Market, on the northeast side of Detroit. Known as \"never closed and never undersold,\" the business became profitable. The market soon began to carry Christmas trees, annuals, and other plants in addition to its mainstay of produce and other goods\n\nIn 1949, Sherr and Weinberg purchased a vacant lot across the street from the market to house the growing number of plants the market offered. According to Sherr, the greenhouse was opened after a bout with a customer that complained the price of coffee at Frank's Market was too high but then willingly purchased a potted geranium for 79¢. The profits on the geranium were much higher than that on the coffee. This incident led Sherr and Weinberg to notice there was to be much more money made selling flowers. Soon after, Frank's Market began selling ferns, trees, lawn chemicals, and other landscaping supplies.\n\nThe business thrived, and in 1957 the company—by then four stores strong—incorporated, becoming Frank's Nursery Sales, Inc. By 1965 Frank's owned 18 stores throughout Michigan, and its sales were $11.35 million, with a net income of $509,000.\n\nSince lawn-and-garden sales were dependent on season, the business was cyclical in nature, with highest revenues during the growing season. This led Sherr and Weinberg to devise a method to keep sales high during the winter months. In 1966, Frank's Trims, a store which only sold craft goods, opened its doors. The company's headquarters remained in Detroit, Michigan. In 1974 Frank's acquired five garden centers from the Green Giant Company.\n\nBy its 25th anniversary in 1971, Frank's had 51 locations in five states, employing approximately 1200 workers. Sales had reached approximately $37.2 million with a net profit of $1.13 million. During this time, Frank Sherr was succeeded by his son, I. William Sherr, who had previously served the company as executive vice-president and treasurer. Max Weinberg continued to serve as company president.\n\nIn 1980, Frank's Nursery Sales officially changed its name to Frank's Nursery & Crafts, Inc. to emphasize both the lawn-and-garden and craft sector of its operation. Sales reached $119.3 million, and 80 locations were in operation. Much of Frank's expansion into different markets can be linked to the purchase of small regional chains.\n\nIn 1982, it acquired many former A&P stores.\n\nIt acquired Philadelphia-based Gaudio's in 1988.\n\nIn 1983, Frank's Nursery & Crafts was purchased by General Host Corporation. General Host bought 96 percent of Frank's shares in a $19-a-share tender offer in March 1983; the value of the sale was thus approximately $42.4 million. Frank's, at that time, spanned 95 stores.\n\nFollowing its acquisition by General Host Corporation, Frank's used its parent company's wealth to go on an acquisition spree with the ultimate goal of becoming the first national garden center chain in the United States. Their first target was the New York-to-Washington, D.C. corridor. From 1983 to 1987, the company acquired 43 garden centers in the New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore/Washington, D.C., metropolitan areas: 39 Flower Time Centers in the NYC metro area (acquired in 1986 and merged into Frank's stores by 1989), 14 Scott's Centers in the Baltimore/Washington, D.C., metro area (1986), and 12 independent garden centers in and around Philadelphia. In addition to its acquisitions, the company was also expanding its footprint southward, with new stores in Virginia, Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee. By 1990, Frank's had almost 300 stores.\n\nIn 1990, the first three Frank's stand-alone Christmas stores, Christmas by Frank's, opened. These stores were temporary installations placed in high-volume regional malls located in trade areas where Frank's also operated conventional stores. The Christmas stores provided shoppers with a convenient store (3,000-5,000 sq ft) where they were able to purchase holiday decorations, crafts and gift-wrap without making a separate stop. Frank's was pleased with the results, and the following year, the company operated 100 of the temporary stores. Indeed, Christmas decorations and crafts had become increasingly important lines to Frank's, helping to compensate for the seasonal sales declines in gardening supplies. Sales in 1992 grew to $558 million, a seven percent increase over the previous year, yet higher costs and interest on General Host's debt caused its profits to decline, from $8.7 million in 1991 to $2.9 million in 1992.\n\nIn 1993, the company launched Frank's SuperCrafts, opening two stores in the Detroit area. Designed as \"superstores,\" the SuperCrafts stores encompassed of retail space, allowing for a wider selection of craft supplies and home and holiday decorations, while incorporating in-store framing shops and floral arrangement services. Moreover, the stores featured hundreds of craft project displays, giving customers creative ideas and allowing them to see firsthand completed projects. A third SuperCrafts store opened in Philadelphia in 1994, and two more followed the same year; one each in New Jersey and Chicago.\n\nBy 1994, in fact, General Host's headlong expansion had come to an end, as a series of new stores proved unprofitable. In January, Frank's announced the closure of 26 stores, most of which were in the Nashville, Tennessee, area and in Florida. Company officials announced that such sales and closings would save General Host $3.8 million annually; other cuts were to come in $25 million worth of inventory, all of which would help service General Host's $238 million in debt.\n\nIn February 2001, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy because it could not afford to pay its vendors. Matters were taken to bankruptcy court, where questions arose as to whether or not Frank's could avoid shutting down its retail stores. The matter was resolved, and the company was able to recover and continue full operation.\n\nIn September 2004, company officials again filed for Chapter 11. The company was heavily in debt, particularly in relation to their vendors. On September 8, of that year the decision was finally made to cease the operation of each of its 170 stores. Agreements were made with Kimco Capital Liquidation Company, which allowed for closing-down sales to be held in every outlet.\nAfter the closure of Frank's, the buildings—with a unique half outdoor, half indoor layout — had been slow to be reoccupied in an over-built retail market.\n"}

He spent his entire life fighting his half brother King Norodom for the throne.\n\nSi Votha was a grandson of King Ang Eng (1772–1796) and a son of King Ang Duong. His biographical notes only record that he had a daughter named Neak Ang Mechas (Princess) Ang Duong Rath Votha. Si Votha had two half-brothers, Norodom and Sisowath of Cambodia, with Norodom being the king's chosen heir. Upon King Ang Duong's death, a succession struggle ensued, with Si Votha attempting to take power while his half brother Norodom was occupied with a rebellion; eventually Norodom gained the upper hand when he gained the backing of Sisowath.\n\nWhen Norodom was officially crowned king in 1864 in a joint coronation ceremony supervised by the French and Siamese officials, Si Votha once again made no secret of his intention to lay claim to the Cambodian throne. Norodom's throne would have been extremely precarious without French support. Sisowath would likely have adopted the same attitude as Si Votha if the Siamese king had allowed him to leave Bangkok. Si Votha's long history of opposition to Norodom, which led him to lead a life of discomfort in the most isolated regions of the kingdom, suggests some deep personal antagonism between the two princes.\n\nDuring the 1870s, taking advantage of a new uprising against Norodom's authority, Si Votha swiftly returned to Cambodia from Thailand. Begging the pardon of the king of Siam for his unauthorized departure, Si Votha left Bangkok, swiftly passed through Battambang, and travelled onward to the higher region of the Mekong. He had little difficulty in quickly raising a large band of supporters and began to harry the officials loyal to King Norodom. He besieged the provincial capital at Kampong Thom and went through the turbulent province of Kampong Svai. Forces dispatched under Norodom's orders failed to apprehend him. As late as 1876, Si Votha remained in revolt, striking at an outpost of Norodom's government, and slipping back to his sanctuary among the Stiengs, one of the tribal groups on the fringes of Cambodian society.\n\nThe French refused to help King Norodom put down Si Votha's revolt until the king concluded a treaty which advocated several reforms. By January 1877, the treaty was concluded and on 15 January, King Norodom proclaimed a series of reforms under the new treaty. In return, the French now bent their efforts to defeating Si Votha's uprising. Si Votha's uprising lasted until 1885-1886. It was Norodom's prestige that ultimately brought Si Votha's resistance to an end. Si Votha, lurking on the northeastern boundaries of the kingdom, was a nuisance but nothing more.\n\nAfter a lifetime of dissidence, Prince Si Votha died in December 1891. After the failure of his efforts in 1885-1886, his followers became fewer, dwindling to a few companions by the time he died. In the closing years of his life, Si Votha entered into hesitant and inconclusive negotiations with the French. Having grown tired of living amongst the less civilized hill tribe people in the jungle of northeastern Cambodia, Si Votha eventually submitted to the French. However, he strongly emphasized his refusal to submit to his half-brother, King Norodom. \n\nAlmost totally abandoned by his followers and virtually without resources, he died on the last day of 1891. Si Votha's life of perpetual dissidence had never brought him within certain reach of toppling Norodom from the throne. Backed by the French, Norodom had always been able to resist Si Votha's uprisings, despite the latter's popular appeal or gift of oratory.\n\nThe French, who were attempting to expand their influence in Cambodia at the time, were pleased by Si Votha's defeat, as he had been an outspoken critic of European colonialism in the area. Si Votha became something of a figurehead for resistance against the French. Si Votha's rebellion was largely unsuccessful, however, and in 1887, Cambodia was incorporated in the French-controlled Indochinese Union.\n\nSi Votha came to symbolise the first fight against the French colonial rule in Cambodia. But his rebellion was largely born out of jealousy and animosity toward his half brother King Norodom, rather than a desire for the independence of his country from France. During his time he was never considered an independence fighter but rather a rebellious usurper of the Cambodian throne.\n\n1. Milton E.

Pyrosomes are cylindrical or cone-shaped colonies up to long, made up of hundreds to thousands of individuals, known as zooids. Colonies range in size from less than one centimeter to several metres in length. They are commonly called \"sea pickles\".\n\nEach zooid is a few millimetres in size, but is embedded in a common gelatinous tunic that joins all of the individuals. Each zooid opens both to the inside and outside of the \"tube\", drawing in ocean water from the outside to its internal filtering mesh called the branchial basket, extracting the microscopic plant cells on which it feeds, and then expelling the filtered water to the inside of the cylinder of the colony. The colony is bumpy on the outside, each bump representing a single zooid, but nearly smooth, although perforated with holes for each zooid, on the inside.\n\nPyrosomes are planktonic, which means their movements are largely controlled by currents, tides, and waves in the oceans. On a smaller scale, however, each colony can move itself slowly by the process of jet propulsion, created by the coordinated beating of cilia in the branchial baskets of all the zooids, which also create feeding currents.\n\nPyrosomes are brightly bioluminescent, flashing a pale blue-green light that can be seen for many tens of metres. The name \"Pyrosoma\" comes from the Greek (\"pyro\" = \"fire\", \"soma\" = \"body\"). Pyrosomes are closely related to salps, and are sometimes called \"fire salps\". Sailors on the ocean occasionally observe calm seas containing many pyrosomes, all luminescing on a dark night.\n\nAlthough many planktonic organisms are bioluminescent, pyrosome bioluminescence is unusual in its brilliance and sustained light emission, and evoked the following comment when seen by the eminent scientist Thomas Huxley at sea:\"I have just watched the moon set in all her glory, and looked at those lesser moons, the beautiful Pyrosoma, shining like white-hot cylinders in the water\" (T.H. Huxley, 1849).\n\nPyrosomes often exhibit waves of light passing back and forth through the colony, as each individual zooid detects light and then emits light in response. Each zooid contains a pair of light organs located near the outside surface of the tunic, which are packed with luminescent organelles that may be intracellular bioluminescent bacteria. The waves of bioluminescence that move within a colony are apparently not propagated by neurons, but by a photic stimulation process. Flashing zooids not only stimulate other zooids within the colony to bioluminesce, but nearby colonies will also display bioluminescence in response. Colonies will bioluminesce in response to mechanical stimulation (touch), as well as to light.\n\nThe following species are accepted as valid by the World Register of Marine Species:\n\n\nIn 2017, pyrosomes were observed to have spread in unprecedented numbers along the Pacific coast of North America as far north as Alaska. The causes remain unknown, but one hypothesis is that this bloom may have resulted in part from unusually warm water along the coast over several preceding years. Scientists were concerned that should there be a massive die-off of the pyrosomes, it could create a huge dead zone as the decomposition of their bodies consumed much of the oxygen dissolved in the surrounding seawater.\n\n\n"}

This is sometimes misleadingly expressed as a rule that \"silence cannot amount to acceptance\".\n\nLater the case has been rethought, because it appeared that on the facts, acceptance was communicated by conduct (see, \"Brogden v Metropolitan Railway\"). Furthermore, in \"Rust v Abbey Life Assurance Co Ltd\" the Court of Appeal held that a failure by a proposed insured to reject a proffered insurance policy for seven months justified on its own an inference of acceptance.\n\nPaul Felthouse was a builder who lived in London. He wanted to buy a horse from his nephew, John Felthouse. After a letter from the nephew concerning a discussion about buying the horse, the uncle replied saying\n\n\"If I hear no more about him, I consider the horse mine at £30.15s.\"\n\nThe nephew did not reply. He was busy at auctions on his farm in Tamworth. He told the man running the auctions, William Bindley, not to sell the horse. But by accident, Bindley did. Uncle Felthouse then sued Bindley in the tort of conversion - using someone else's property inconsistently with their rights. But for the Uncle to show the horse was his property, he had to show there was a valid contract. Bindley argued there was not, since the nephew had never communicated his acceptance of the uncle's offer.\n\nThe court ruled that Felthouse did not have ownership of the horse as there was no acceptance of the contract. Acceptance must be communicated clearly and cannot be imposed due to silence of one of the parties. The uncle had no right to impose a sale through silence whereby the contract would only fail by repudiation. Though the nephew expressed interest in completing the sale there was no communication of that intention until before the horse was sold at auction on 25 February. The nephew's letter of 27 February which was submitted as evidence by Felthouse was judged to be the first instance of communication where the acceptance was communicated to the offeror(Felthouse).And by this time, the horse had already been sold. Accordingly Felthouse had no interest in the property.\n\nWilles J delivered the lead judgment.\n\nThe result was affirmed in the Court of Exchequer Chamber, (1863) 7 LT 835.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2097531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097531", "title": "Real People", "text": "Real People\n\nReal People is a reality television series that aired Wednesdays from 8 pm to 9 pm, and it ran from 1979 to 1984. Its initial episodes aired live in the Eastern and Central time zones. \"Real People\" featured \"real people\" (as opposed to celebrities) with unique occupations or hobbies.\n\n\"Real People\" featured a panel of seated hosts in front of a large studio audience. The hosts introduced pre-filmed segments and engaged in comedic banter about them. Each segment was a visit to someone with a unique occupation or hobby. Occasionally, someone was brought into the studio to interact with the audience.\n\nIn its early seasons, \"Real People\" was NBC's most popular series, often scoring at the top of the ratings, and was a rare hit for the network at a time when NBC was a distant third in the ratings and struggling with numerous flops. Segments included \"funny pictures\" and funny newspaper errors sent by viewers, who then were awarded a \"Real People\" T-shirt.\n\nRegular hosts included John Barbour, Sarah Purcell, Byron Allen, Skip Stephenson, Bill Rafferty, Mark Russell, Peter Billingsley, David Ruprecht, and Fred Willard.\n\nThe success of \"Real People\" led to a batch of imitators, the best known and longest-running of which was \"That's Incredible!\" which aired on ABC, and \"That's My Line\" on CBS, hosted by Bob Barker. \"Real People\" gave fitness instructor Richard Simmons his major break into the mass media and spotlighted unique talents such as Pittsburgh Police traffic cop Vic Cianca.\n\nWhen repeats of the show initially were syndicated by Telepictures to broadcast stations, it was edited into 30-minute segments and retitled \"More Real People\".\n\nIn 1980, NBC launched two attempts at spin-offs: \"Speak Up, America\" and \"Real Kids\". \"Speak Up, America\" starred former child televangelist Marjoe Gortner and basically expanded the opening segment of \"Real People\" (in which audience members were encouraged to sound off about any topics they wished) into a full hour program. \"Real Kids\" starred Peter Billingsley and a cast of child hosts in a format that mirrored \"Real People\", but focused only on kids. Both spin-off formats quickly failed, though Billingsley went on to join \"Real People\" as a recurring host / contributor.\n\nA one-hour retrospective special aired on October 1, 1991 with hosts Sarah Purcell and Fred Willard.\n\nThe show was spoofed on \"Sesame Street\" with \"Real Grouches\", hosted by Oscar the Grouch who described his show as a program that \"searches the world for interesting real-life Grouches and brings them right into your living room.\" Oscar's guests were Romeo Scuggs from Gila Monster, New Mexico; Luba Merquick from Slime Bottom, Arkansas; and \"Bob the Blob\". While the previous guests played terrible music, the Blob plays \"yucky sweet flute music\", and it is revealed that it was Bob McGrath disguised as a Grouch.\n\nA 1980 \"Saturday Night Live\" episode spoofed the show, alongside contemporary hit \"That's Incredible!\", in a sketch called \"Real Incredible People\", in which the hosts were astounded by relatively mundane individuals such as a woman who reads before going to bed and a (Japanese) man who eats raw fish.\n"}
{"id": "2097535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097535", "title": "Rick Jeanneret", "text": "Rick Jeanneret\n\nJohn Richard Jeanneret (born July 23, 1942) is a Canadian-born television and radio personality best known as the play-by-play announcer for the National Hockey League's Buffalo Sabres and its broadcast network, the Sabres Hockey Network. Having started with the team on radio during the team's second season in 1971–72, he is the longest-tenured play-by-play announcer with a single team in NHL history. He moved to television during the 1995–96 season and began doubling both television and radio play-by-play duties during the 1997–98 season. He is known as \"RJ\" within the Sabres organization and by close associates.\n\nJeanneret is a Canadian-American of Swiss descent. It is often incorrectly reported that Jeanneret was born in Switzerland; he was actually born in St. Catharines, Ontario and raised in Terrace Bay, Ontario. He is known for his energetic delivery (especially during big plays and fights), colorful player nicknames, passionate goal calls, and his trademark suspenders worn on air and uncanny resemblance to late comedian Rodney Dangerfield.\n\nJeanneret has announced every Sabres season except for the team's first. This season was announced in its entirety on radio by Ted Darling, and for seven games on television by then-unknown Dave Hodge, who the next year left to become the host of \"Hockey Night in Canada\".\n\nJeanneret worked alongside Jim Lorentz for over 20 years before Lorentz retired. Harry Neale, former color commentator for the Toronto Maple Leafs regional broadcasts and was a commentator on \"Hockey Night in Canada\" until the end of the 2006–07 season, was Jeanneret's partner through the 2011-12 season. Former Sabres enforcer Rob Ray is Jeanneret's current partner for the \"MSG Network\" and \"WGR\", occasionally alternating with Martin Biron.\n\nJeanneret is a graduate of the Midwest Broadcasting School, a Chicago-based institution that Jeanneret described as a \"crash course\" in broadcasting.\n\nIn 1963, Jeanneret took over the play-by-play of a Niagara Falls Flyers Junior A hockey game for the regular announcer, Edd Felstead, who had become sick. Jeanneret became the color analyst the following season before assuming full-time play by play radio duties in 1965. During the 1960s and early 1970s, Rick did several radio advertisements for local Niagara Falls hardware store Buildall. Jeanneret also called Buffalo Bisons (AHL) road games in 1969-70.\n\nFrom 1984 until 1992, he did the Sabres' play-by-play in addition to being a popular early-morning disc jockey at the now-defunct CJRN-AM in Niagara Falls, Ontario. In 1992, he chose to retire from CJRN and concentrate solely on the Sabres. \"I had enough of two jobs. I finished the game, came home and had to be up by 4 a.m.,\" he said.\n\nJeanneret helped close the Aud on the final night of the regular season in 1996 with an emotional tribute to his colleague Ted Darling, who was the voice of the Sabres from 1970 until the worsening effects from Pick's Disease forced him to retire in the midst of the 1991–92 season. \"I wish that standing next to me right now would be Ted Darling,\" said Jeanneret from the ice surface in a postgame ceremony. \"See you in September, one block in that direction,\" said Jeanneret, pointing toward the new arena, then dubbed the Crossroads Arena and now called KeyBank Center.\n\nIn 2005, Jeanneret and the Sabres released a CD that collected some of his most memorable calls. Proceeds from the CD, which was titled \"Roll the Highlight Film\", went to charity. It was followed up in 2006 with \"Top Shelf\" (named after his signature call, \"Top Shelf, where momma hides the cookies!\"), a similarly themed DVD.\n\nDue to increasing age and health concerns, Jeanneret's retirement has been long rumored and speculated. Each year since the 2004–05 NHL lockout, however, Jeanneret has effectively agreed to \"one more year.\" Jeanneret's contract was extended in 2007 through the 2008–09 NHL season. It was further extended in 2008 through the 2009–10 season. He was back for the 2010–11 season along with Neale. During these seasons, Jeanneret did not broadcast games while the Sabres had west coast road trips and a home game against the Boston Bruins. This most recently was from December 27, 2010 through January 8, 2011. He was also off when the Sabres played the Ottawa Senators in Ottawa on January 25, 2011. During Jeanneret's vacation, his son Mark and Kevin Sylvester filled in on play-by-play from December 27, 2010 through January 8, 2011. The idea for Jeanneret to take time off during west coast road games during these seasons was that of former managing partner Larry Quinn.\n\nOn May 26, 2011, the Sabres announced that Jeanneret (and Neale) would only cover home games and 10 to 15 road games for the Sabres in the 2011-12 NHL season. This was in preparation for Jeanneret's pending retirement, in which Jeanneret stated that he almost retired after the 2010–11 season, but sought the reduced schedule instead. Studio host Kevin Sylvester was tabbed to call those road games, along with Danny Gare. Jeanneret indicated he would take up an increased workload in 2012-13, although he would stop short of a full-time broadcast.\n\nOn June 27, 2012, Jeanneret announced that he would return to the broadcast booth full-time during the 2012-13 season, this time with Rob Ray serving as color commentator in addition to the bench reporter role Ray had served in for previous seasons. Jeanneret indicated it would be his last full season with the team, and the decision may have been influenced by the labor dispute that shortened the length of the season. Furthermore, Jeanneret missed the first four games of the season due to illness; he ended up calling 44 games for the Sabres in the shortened 2013 season. Jeanneret confirmed he would return for the 2013-14 season (he had signed a two-year contract the previous year) but did not make a solid commitment to how many games he would call in that season. Most indications were that Jeanneret would call 55 to 65 games for the 2013-14 season.\n\nJeanneret announced his intent to slowly phase out of the Sabres play-by-play job over the course of three years. Dan Dunleavy has already been chosen as Jeanneret's successor and will take over play-by-play duties, first as the substitute, then permanently. Jeanneret called 47 games in 2014–15 and called 41 games in 2015–16; as of 2014, he still intended on retiring in 2016 but did not entirely rule out changing his mind. Indeed, Jeanneret would sign an agreement to call another half-season of games in 2016–17.\n\nOn July 1, 2014, Jeanneret was diagnosed with stage 3 throat cancer, which required Jeanneret to miss part of the 2014-15 NHL season. Although he initially sought treatment in his native Canada due to Canada's universal single-payer health care system, he later sought American treatment (coincidentally, from the same doctor that also treated Buffalo Bills quarterback Jim Kelly) due to his stronger personal attachment with the United States after four decades of work in the country. On November 7, 2014 Jeanneret announced that following a CAT scan he was clear of cancer. He returned to broadcasting Sabres games eight days later on Saturday, November 15, calling the first period of the game against the Maple Leafs.\n\nIn April 2018, Jeanneret said that he was leaning toward returning for the 2018-19 season, but he was not certain because of his age and possible health complications (in addition to the cancer battle, he also had a pacemaker installed).\n\nJeanneret appeared in a commercial for Molson Canadian, giving a call for a pick-up pond hockey game.\n\nJeanneret is the play-by-play announcer for ICE's Super Chexx arcade machines.\n\nOn December 22, 2018, during the third period in a home game against the Anaheim Ducks, Jeanneret suffered an acute medical emergency and abruptly cut out of the broadcast, leaving color commentator Rob Ray and on-site studio host Brian Duff to call play-by-play for the remainder of the game. Almost immediately, fans watching the broadcast or listening to the game took to the Sabres' Twitter page, expressing worry and concern for Jeanneret and asking for updates. Eyewitnesses noticed Jeanneret being escorted out of the arena on a stretcher. Buffalo News sports commentator Mike Harrington, who was at the game, tweeted about seeing the situation unfold, prompting hundreds of further tweets from fans at the Sabres' page. Jeanneret had shown no signs of illness immediately prior to the game. In an interview the next day, Jeanneret, who was still recovering in the hospital, noted that the emergency was not heart-related and that he had overheated prior to losing consciousness (something that he noted was unusual since the arena is usually cold, although Jeanneret had worn a Santa Claus suit for an extended portion of the evening); he did not miss any more of his scheduled play-by-play duties.\n\nJeanneret stated in April 2019, as the 2018-19 season wound down, that he was going to take much more time to decide whether he would return. He expressed major disappointment in the Sabres play that season, noting he had never seen a team collapse the way the Sabres had that year.\n\nJeanneret resides in Niagara Falls, Ontario with his wife, Sandra. He has two sons, Mark and Chris and a step daughter Shelly. His son Mark Jeanneret is the Events Coordinator for the Erie Sports Commission in Erie, Pennsylvania, where he used to be the play-by-play announcer for the Erie Otters of the OHL and was a substitute for Rick with the Buffalo Sabres on December 27 and 28, 2010 on games against the Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers. Chris teaches Radio Broadcasting at Niagara College in Welland, Ontario. Shelly is a wedding, portrait and event photographer in Niagara Falls.\n\nOn April 9, 2001, as part of a promotion on radio station WNSA (at the time the Sabres' flagship station), Jeanneret called a fictional game known as the \"Sabres Showdown.\" The fictional matchup was simulated on the NHL 2001 video game, and was said to be a matchup between the 1974–75 Buffalo Sabres and the 1998–99 Sabres, both of whom had been to the Stanley Cup finals. The game was said to have taken place at Buffalo Memorial Auditorium, classic Sabres audio clips were played during intermission, and WNSA purposely held out any regular game staff from the commentary who had actually played on the 1974–75 team so as to make it seem as if they were actually playing the game. (For instance, color commentator Jim Lorentz was replaced by Mike Robitaille, who played for the Sabres in 1974–75 but had been traded before the playoffs, and WNSA hosts filled in other positions.) The 1975 team won the game thanks to Gilbert Perreault's game winning shootout goal.\n\nIn all actuality, many of the members of the 1974–75 squad are still together, working for the Sabres organization and playing occasionally for the Buffalo Sabres Alumni Hockey Team.\n\nJeanneret, along with former Sabre Dale Hawerchuk were inducted into the Buffalo Sabres Hall of Fame on November 8, 2011.\n\nOn June 6, 2012, the Sabres announced that Jeanneret would be inducted into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nOn June 8, 2012, the Sabres announced that Jeanneret would be given the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award and thus be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. He was inducted on November 12, 2012.\n\nJeanneret was inducted into the Buffalo Broadcasting Hall of Fame on September 20, 2012.\n\nThe Bare Knuckle Boxing Hall of Fame inducted Jeanneret as an 'honorary inductee' on July 7, 2018, on the grounds of his calling blow-by-blow on in-game fights, which the Hall's committee considered the closest modern equivalent to bare-knuckle boxing.\n\n"}

The university comprises 8 schools and 12 departments, enrolling 35,338 students and having 1,370 academic and professional staff. At present, the university offers 54 undergraduate degree programs, 75 master's degree programs, 16 doctoral schools and five PhD programs. It is the second-largest university of Rome by enrollment and one of the largest research-based institutions in the country.\n\nThe idea of founding a third university in Rome was flagged in the middle 1980s when the Ministry of Public Education formed a committee of inquiry into higher education to deal with a perceived emergency in university enrollments in Rome. After much debate, a future campus location was selected in what was a semi-industrial part of the city and it was decided that the future university be named with a number in chronological order. Roma Tre University, was formally established in 1992 under the name Terza Università degli Studi di Roma (Third University of Rome). One of the milestones for Roma Tre, since its foundation, as well as a guideline for its development, was its incorporation in the surrounding area, characterised by the reclamation of old buildings and school premises, transformed into facilities for study and research.\n\nPope Francis visited the University, Rome's youngest, on February 17, 2017.\n\nThe Rector, the Vice Rector, the Academic Senate and the Board of Governors are the main governing bodies of the university, which are responsible for setting university policy and development strategy. The statute also provides for a University Executive Committee, the Students' Representative Council, the Council of Faculty Deans and a University Ombudsman.\n\nThe Rector is the official representative of the University. As well as calling and chairing meetings of the Academic Senate, the Board of Governors and the University Executive Committee, the Rector supervises the university's teaching, scientific and service structures, and gives appropriate guidance. The Rector also acts as ombudsman for the teaching and research autonomy of academic staff. The current Rector is Prof. Mario Panizza.\n\nThe University has double degree agreements with:\n\nRoma Tre University holds a number of academic cooperation agreements with foreign universities, promoting professors, researchers and students mobility and exchange.\n\nThe global partnerships include the University of Brasilia, the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, the University of Passo Fundo, the University of Talca, the University of Valparaíso.\n\nRoma Tre University takes part into a series of international university networks that share the task of promoting cooperative activities in diverse fields and seek to create a European area of communal higher education.\n\nThe association groups and networks of which Roma Tre University is a member are:\n\nAdmission to the University is restricted and competitive. Every School offers a limited number of places for each program, and admissions are regulated by an entrance examination delivered by the University Admissions Committee.\n\nThe primary objective of the 8 schools of Roma Tre University is to define, organise and connect the academic activities of the degree courses:\n\nThe Astre School of Advanced Studies was the university superior graduate school for particularly motivated students. Roma Tre University has established, among the others, an exchange agreement within the School's program with the University of California, Berkeley. \n\n\n\nRoma Tre University is ranked:\n\nThe School of Economics is ranked in the top 25% institutions in Italy in the RePEc ranking.\n\nThe School of Law is constantly ranked among the top-five in the country with a note of AAA (Censis-\"La Repubblica\"), mostly due to the selective entry test and to the small-size of the classes.\n\nStudent life at the University does not merely revolve around lectures and exams, as there is a diverse array of student activities. There are many student organisations organizing student exchange programmes throughout Europe.\n\nStudents elect their representatives (Student Vice-Dean and the Student Parliament) to coordinate various student activities, represent their interests in the Faculty bodies, participate in the evaluation of studies and the faculty, and secure the involvement and participation of students in all matters and issues of interest to them.\n\nEvery year, during the academic year opening ceremony, a distinguished public figure is invited to address the students with a lecture on a current global issue. Since the University foundation, there have been 5 Heads of state speaking at the ceremony. Past speakers include Antonio Ruberti, the 9th President of Italy Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the 49th Prime Minister of Italy Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Leah Rabin, Shirin Ebadi, the member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, the 7th European Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science Philippe Busquin, the 264th Pope John Paul II, Kerry Kennedy, Marco Travaglio, the 6th President of the European Parliament Josep Borrell Fontelles, the 34th President of Chile Michelle Bachelet, the 11th President of Italy Giorgio Napolitano, the 52nd Prime Minister of Italy Romano Prodi. \n\nNotable alumni include: Andrea Alù, Alessandro Di Battista, Joseph Pace, Marco Lo Muscio, Raffaele Monti, Virginia Raggi, and Cinzia Giorgio.

Schmidt in 1926. It is a variation of traditional Welsh rarebit and was one of two signature sandwiches created by chefs at the Brown Hotel shortly after its founding in 1923. It was created to serve as an alternative to ham and egg late-night suppers.\n\nThe Hot Brown is an open-faced sandwich of baked chicken or turkey breast and bacon, covered in creamy Mornay sauce and baked or broiled until the bread is crisp and the sauce begins to brown. Cheddar cheese or American cheese may be added for the sauce. Alternatives for garnishes include tomatoes, mushroom slices, and, very rarely, canned peaches.\n\nSome Hot Browns also include ham with the turkey, and either pimentos or tomatoes over the sauce, and imitation Hot Browns sometimes substitute a commercial cheese sauce instead of the Mornay.\n\nWhen Fred K. Schmidt created the Hot Brown, its sliced roast turkey was a rarity, as turkey was usually reserved for holiday feasts. The original Hot Brown included the sliced turkey on an open-faced white toast sandwich, with Mornay sauce covering it, with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese, completed by being oven-broiled until bubbly. Pimento and bacon strips were then added to it. After its debut, it quickly became the choice of 95% of the Brown Hotel's restaurant customers.\n\nThe dish is a local specialty and favorite of the Louisville area, and is popular throughout Kentucky. It was long unavailable at its point of origin, as the Brown Hotel was shuttered from 1971 to 1985.\n\nThe \"cold brown\" was baked poultry (chicken or turkey), hard-boiled egg, lettuce, and tomato open-faced on rye bread, and covered with Thousand Island dressing. It is rarely served anymore.\n\nIn St. Louis, the Prosperity Sandwich is a similar dish, with origins at the Mayfair Hotel in the 1920s. It is still served in the area today, and sometimes called a \"hot brown\".\n\nThe Turkey Devonshire, first served in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the 1930s, has been described as being similar to the Hot Brown.\n\nOn the Food Network, the Hot Brown was featured in an episode of \"Throwdown! with Bobby Flay\". Joe and John Castro, chefs of the Brown Hotel in Kentucky, competed and won against Flay in a cook-off. It has also been featured on episodes of the network's shows \"The Rachel Ray Show\" and \"Southern Fried Road Trip\". On the Travel Channel, the Hot Brown has been featured on the show \"Taste of America\" with Mark DeCarlo a Louisville-themed episode of \"Man v. Food Nation\". and a 2018 episode of \"Food Paradise\" titled \"Sandwich Heroes\".\n\nOn PBS, the Hot Brown has been featured in the documentary \"Sandwiches That You Will Like\" as well as the program \"The Mind of a Chef\", where Chef David Chang presented his interpretation of the sandwich.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2097595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097595", "title": "Eurydice I of Macedon", "text": "Eurydice I of Macedon\n\nEurydice (Greek: – from ευρύς \"eurys\", \"wide\" and δίκη \"dike\", \"right, custom, usage, law; justice\", literally \"wide justice\") was an ancient Macedonian queen, wife of king Amyntas III of Macedon.\n\nShe was the daughter of Sirras of Lyncestis, Upper Macedonia. Eurydice had four children: Alexander II, Perdiccas III, Philip II, all of whom would be crowned kings, a daughter Eurynoe, and through her son Philip, she was the paternal grandmother of Alexander the Great. Literary, inscriptional and archaeological evidence indicates that she played an important public role in Macedonian life and acted aggressively in the political arena.\n\nEurydice's political activities mark a turning point in Macedonian history. She is the first known royal woman who actively took political action and successfully exerted political influence.\n\nEurydice was born between 410-404 BC, most probably in 407 BC. She was the daughter of the Lyncestian noble Sirras, who is sometimes referred as of Lyncestian, and the Lyncestian Arrhabaeus was her maternal grandfather.\n\nKing Amyntas III of Macedon married the young princess Eurydice in about 390 BC, probably in an effort to secure peace allies against the Illyrians, after he was defeated by them in 393 BC. Ten years later king Amyntas III was forced to entrust a portion of his kingdom to the Greek Chalcidians, who refused to relinquish it, and by 382 BC had extended their control westward, including Macedon’s capital Pella. Sparta, the most powerful of the Greek states at that time, intervened and restored Amyntas to his capital in 379 BC, but Macedonia had to accept subservience to Sparta.\n\nAmyntas had another wife, a fellow kinswoman named Gygaea, who had three children. At some point during her husband's reign, Eurydice became the dominant wife. Still it cannot be determined whether this development was immediate or gradual, linked with her family and relations, her higher status, the ages of her sons or a combination of these factors. Nevertheless, for the first time events in the life of a royal woman were also central to the political arena of Macedonia in that period and Eurydice was, however, the most important factor in the change.\n\nEurydice was literate, although she learned to read rather late in life, probably due to being part of a culture that still was heavily oral in nature and where literacy was not fundamental to knowledge, even more in the case of those who had the wealth and leisure to be read to.\n\nHer life career is full of controversy. According to the Roman historian Justin, Eurydice conspired with her son-in-law Ptolemy of Aloros to kill Amyntas, then marry Ptolemy, and then give the throne to her lover. But the queen's daughter, Eurynoe, foiled the plot by revealing it to her father, Amyntas, who, nevertheless, spared Eurydice from punishment because of their common children. Eventually in 370/369 BC, Amyntas III died, and his eldest son, Alexander II succeeded him. In 368 BC, Ptolemy of Aloros killed Alexander II, despite an earlier settlement between them, worked out by Pelopidas, a Theban statesman and general. Then Ptolemy was forced by Pelopidas to agree merely to be regent for Alexander's two younger brothers, Perdiccas III and Philip II.\n\nLater on Eurydice married Ptolemy. It is unlikely that Eurydice voluntarily married her eldest son's murderer, most probably she acted to ensure the succession of her remaining sons. A new pretender of the throne, Pausanias was very popular and was attracting support in Macedonia. Queen Eurydice asked the Athenian general Iphicrates (their father's adoptive son) to protect the throne for her two sons. Iphicrates drove out Pausanias. There is no evidence that Ptolemy had any role in this matter, or suggests that anyone other than Eurydice would have influenced Iphicrates. Even if she was prompted by Ptolemy, her successful intervention in political and military affairs remains remarkably bold and without any known precedent, an extraordinary act for a royal woman. Eurydice took the unprecedented step of seeking international help when she believed the succession of her remaining sons was in jeopardy and her attempt was successful.\n\nIn 365 BC Perdiccas III avenged his brother's murder by murdering Ptolemy and taking the throne. This caused a stir amongst the families of Macedon, which called in Pelopidas to re-establish peace. As part of the peace settlement, Philip II was taken as a hostage to Thebes. Perdiccas reigned until 359 BC, and already weakened by struggles against Athens, he confronted the Illyrian ruler Bardylis and died along with 4000 of his men in a disastrous battle. Eventually his youngest brother Philip II took control of the kingdom.\n\nEurydice was also very active in the cult activities. She may have funded the construction of the temple of Eucleia cult at Vergina. She had made a dedication \"polietisi\" (πολιετισι) to or for women citizens, and perhaps to the Muses, grateful for her acquired education.\n\nEurydice's portrait-statue, together with those of her most celebrated son Philip II, Philip II's wife, Olympias, her grandson, Alexander the Great, and her husband, Amyntas III, were realized by the Athenian statuary and sculptor Leochares in ivory and gold. They were placed in the Philippeion, a circular building in the Altis at Olympia, erected by Philip II of Macedon in celebration of his victory at the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC).\n\nEurydice's tomb was found and identified by the Greek archaeologist Manolis Andronikos in 1987 in Vergina (ancient Aigai), a UNESCO World Heritage Site, along with other royal Macedonian tombs.\nIn the summer of 2001, between August 13 and September 9 the tomb of Eurydice was robbed and seven marble figurines had been taken. Eurydice's tomb had faced robbery and was partially plundered since antiquity, probably soon after queen's burial, but the looters had probably failed in their mission, as evidenced by two skeletons found there. An inscribed pot fragment, dating 344/3 BC was found inside the tomb, whereas two inscriptions, one of which dated in 340 BC, have been found in Vergina of \"Eurydika daughter of Sirras to goddess Eukleia\".\n\nPlutarch explicitly states that Eurydice was an Illyrian, so does Libanius and thus is stated in the massive 10th century Byzantine encyclopaedia, Suda.\n\nFrom the modern scholars and historians, Eugene N. Borza, A. B. Bosworth and Kate Mortensen support an Illyrian ancestry, whereas and Charles F. Edson dispute an Illyrian origin and favour a Lyncestian ancestry for her. In an inductive analysis of the historical information over Sirras, through an a posteriori argument, Elias Kapetanopoulos, a Greek historian, also says that Sirras must have been a Lyncestian, not an Illyrian, as Eurydice as well. Ian Worthington makes a convincing case for her Lyncestian ancestry, stating that while some dispute her ethnicity thinking her father Sirrhas may have been an Illyrian, \"However, this is unlikely in light of a comment that Attalus made at the wedding of Philip in 337, intended as a slur on Alexander's legitimacy, for his mother was from Epirus.\". And Ian Worthington reasons further that \"Attalus' taunt, incidentally, goes some way to determining whether Philip's mother Eurydice was Lyncestian or Illyrian. If she had been the latter, then Attalus' remark would, by implication, make Philip also \"illegitimate\"...Hence Philip's mother was probably Lyncestian\". Others also argue on her possible Lyncestian origin, stating that \"she might have been descendent from a branch of the Bacchiadae clan, originally of Corinth.\"\n\nStories of Eurydice's plots against her husband and her sons are at odds with other historical evidence and may be fabricated. Recent scholars have noted the many implausibilities in Justin’s narrative and have acknowledged Eurydice's near-contemporary evidences of Aeschines towards her. Aeschines described Eurydice I as the loyal defender of her sons, whereas a Plutarch’s passage describes Eurydice as a good model in the education of children.\n\n\n"}

He moved to the merchant service, became a second mate, and while at Lisbon, he was impressed by the Royal Navy. First sent to under Lord Jervis, he soon received an assignment to a prize crew on a captured Spanish merchantman. Benefiting from lax discipline, Percival led an uprising and escaped to the American merchant ship \"Washington\". Again impressment interrupted his homeward journey—this time by the Dutch Navy. Managing to escape a second time, once home, he decided to enter the U.S. Navy in 1799. Subsequently, he served in the Quasi-War with France as a master's mate and midshipman. He was discharged in the demobilization of 1801 and went back to the merchant service.\n\nPercival married Maria Pinkerton of Trenton, New Jersey in 1809. The couple did not have children although they informally adopted a relative, Maria Weeks.\n\nIn 1809, he returned to the U.S. Navy as a sailing master, assigned to at the Norfolk Navy Yard. After a leave, he moved to the New York yard under Commodore Jacob Lewis. Placed in command of \"Gunboat No. 6\", he engaged in several skirmishes with British forces plaguing American shipping. As a stratagem, Percival borrowed the fishing smack \"Yankee\" on the Fourth of July in 1813, using it to capture the unsuspecting , the tender of the 74-gun . Percival joined on 9 March 1814 and made three cruises during which the ship sloop captured nineteen merchantmen and two warships, and the East India Company armed brig , 12 percent of the total taken by the U.S. Navy during the war. For his gallantry in the capture of HMS \"Epervier\", he was promoted to lieutenant and presented with a special sword by Congress, shown in the accompanying portrait from about 1860.\n\nAfter the war, the Navy assigned Percival to the Boston Navy Yard. Within weeks, he reported for duty on . The captain's clerk, Charles J. Deblois, noted \"Lt. P. carries a taught hand, ... He goes by the name of Mad Jack.\" This is the earliest record of Percival's colorful nickname. Apparently tracing to his intense command style, the application of monikers to military and naval officers was common to the time. After a cruise to South America, he returned to serve as executive office at the Boston yard. In late 1823, he transferred to the frigate on the Pacific station under Commodore Isaac Hull. The two New Englanders were close associates and friends throughout their careers. Hull considered Percival \"the best sailor I ever saw!\"\n\nIn 1826, Hull put him in command of and directed him to the far reaches of the uncharted Pacific to track down the mutineers of the Nantucket whaleship . In the Mulgrave Islands, he recovered two innocent crewmen, the only survivors of the ill-fated whaler. The culprits behind the mutiny had killed one another or were dispatched by natives. Mad Jack returned by way of the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), the first American naval ship to visit the place. His stay proved controversial and provided fodder for writers over the years. American missionaries clashed with the naval officer who challenged their sway over the local civil authorities. Under growing pressure from visiting merchant and whaling crews, the authorities rescinded a missionary-advocated ban on young women swimming out to the visiting vessels. The missionaries blamed their loss of influence on Percival. Their forceful complaints to Washington compelled Percival to eventually ask for a court of inquiry to clear his name. The court absolved him of wrongdoing, while to this day, United States destroyer squadrons based at Pearl Harbor celebrate Mad Jack Percival Day each May 11, the date \"Dolphin\" left the islands in 1826.\n\nPercival next commanded the U.S. schooner on an 1830–1831 cruise against the troublesome West Indian pirates. While on leave in 1832, the department notified him of his promotion to Master Commandant effective in March 1831. After, in 1834–1835, he had the U.S. sloop-of-war on the Brazil station. In 1836, once again, he took over as executive officer in Boston. While assigned this duty, Percival displayed his concern for the welfare of the common sailor. A group of seamen transferring from the Brooklyn yard to Boston were injured, four of them seriously, when their train derailed along the way. The four received a total settlement of $12,862. Percival volunteered to administer a trust set up in behalf of the men. He did so over several years with prudence and faithfulness, paying out every cent to the beneficiaries or their survivors. The extensive and detailed record of Percival's careful and honest handling of the matter can be found in his papers at the Massachusetts Historical Society. (This relatively insignificant episode warrants this brief mention, because a careless writer, relying on insufficient research, wrongly charged that Percival absconded with the funds. From time to time, the misrepresentation is repeated.)\n\nIn 1838, he received command of the second-class ship sloop and headed to the Mediterranean to again serve under Hull. A principal ancillary duty involved educating and training young midshipman. Percival undertook the task with zeal and passion. Prominent men and fellow officers with midshipmen sons commonly asked for their youngster to be placed under the stern tutelage of Mad Jack. The young men did not always appreciate it at the time, but many went on to notable careers. As one example, Gustavus V. Fox chafed under Percival's disciplined approach on the cruise, but went on to become Lincoln's assistant secretary of the navy. Others distinguished themselves in combat. John L. Worden, a \"Cyane\" midshipman, became an admiral and is remembered as a hero of the Battle of Hampton Roads. One of the most irksome midshipmen on the cruise, nonetheless, recognized an appreciated their skipper. Henry A. Wise summarized the almost universal feeling in the service when he noted: \"There is not a better sailor in the world than Cap. Percival or a man of better judgement in the qualities requisite for a Seaman. ... One would suppose from his impatient & passionate temper, that in case of danger he would lose all command of himself. On the contrary no one is cooler or more able to fulfill the duties of his station. To give the devil his due—I would rather trust my life to his charge in case of emergency at Sea than any other man in the United States Navy.\"\n\nPercival left \"Cyane\" late in 1839 due to poor health. While waiting for an assignment, he received promotion to captain in September 1841, the highest U.S. Navy rank at the time.\n\nHe began the most memorable chapter of his life in November 1843. The frigate presented a major concern to the department. In disrepair, the venerable old ship served as a mere receiving (barracks) ship at Norfolk. Naval Constructor Foster Rhodes figured it would cost $70,000 to fit her out for sea. But the department did not have the money. Acting Secretary David Henshaw, from Massachusetts, knew about Mad Jack's reputation for seamanship and frugality. He told Percival to take a look. Percival reported he could do the work for $10,000. Despite widespread doubts about Percival's findings, Henshaw gave him the task.\n\nBy mid-January 1844 Percival informed the secretary he \"unhesitatingly\" determined the ship ready for \"a two or even a three year cruise.\" And he was prepared to stake \"his life and reputation\" on his assessment. Accordingly, Henshaw told the captain to get his ship ready for sea. Percival found it necessary to sail to New York to complete his 447-man crew. Percival's orders directed him to carry the first U.S. ambassador to Brazil, proceed to the east coast of Africa and on to the China seas, making his best way back to the United States. He left New York at the end of May 1844. Before the voyage ended in Boston 495 days later, the ship sailed 52,370.5 miles, circumnavigating the globe for the only time in her illustrious career.\n\nA number of members of the crew kept detailed journals of the cruise, and one officer even sketched entertaining watercolors of scenes and incidents along the way. Added to official correspondence, the result is a well-documented trip. One episode stands out above all others. In early May 1845, the ship anchored in Touron Bay, Cochin China (now Vietnam). On the second day, Percival received a note from a French missionary, Bishop Dominique Lefevere, saying the local authorities had him under arrest and condemned him to death. Within an hour, Mad Jack led 80 well-armed men ashore. Percival left a letter for the king of Cochin China demanding the bishop's release. To make his point, he returned to the ship with three mandarins held as hostages. The next day, Percival pressed the issue by capturing three junks belonging to the king, and moved his warship closer to the local forts. On the following day, the prize junks attempted to escape, but were recovered after a brief skirmish. Percival, as well as the Cochin Chinese themselves, denied the gunplay resulted in any casualties. Nonetheless, a rumor of fatalities continued into the 20th century when the confrontation became known as the first armed intervention by a Western nation against present-day Vietnam. In any event, a short while later Lefevere gained his freedom and the French credited the American effort for saving his life. King Louis Philippe intended to reward officers and crew. But political turmoil interfered. Since the king \"took a hurried journey from his capital, ... no recognition of their services was ever received by the American tars.\" Their compensation went \"over the walls of the Tuileries gardens\" as Louis Philippe escaped to London.\n\nAfter \"Constitution\" returned from her voyage in October 1845, Captain Percival went on leave and was placed on \"waiting orders\" status. In 1855, when Percival was 76 years old, the Navy Department placed him on the newly created \"Reserve List\", a forerunner of the Retired List. Although Percival was alive during the first year of the American Civil War, he took no part in it.\n\nIn his last years, Percival gave silver cups to a few people close to him. One, given to the son of his attorney, offered a brief summary of his career. As well as anything, the inscription explains the man. Percival wrote: \"This Cup, with the Donor, has made three cruises to the Pacific, one to the Mediterranean, one to the , two to the West Indies, and once around the world, a distance of about 150,000 miles. Has been 37 years in service and has never refused duty.\" Some years ago, a private collector found the cup in a London flea market, and it was sold for $10,000 in a 2016 Cape Cod auction.\n\nOften described as colorful, Mad Jack attracted the attention of famed authors such as Hawthorne, Melville, and Michener. Melville, in fact, patterned his fictional character Lieutenant Mad Jack after his acquaintance, Percival. In the end, Percival's legendary status is enhanced by the fact his first naval ship, HMS \"Victory\" and his last, USS \"Constitution\", the oldest commissioned warship and the oldest commissioned warship afloat, remain national shrines for their respective nations.\n\nCaptain Percival died at the age of 83 on 7 September 1862 in Dorchester, Massachusetts and is buried near his birthplace in West Barnstable's Ancient Cemetery.\n\n\nSource – \"Mad Jack Percival\".

Within its small grid of streets is the 13th-century church of Chipstead which has been, since time immemorial, its ecclesiastical parish. Hooley is connected via paths and the A23 road to the larger community of Coulsdon, to the north, in the London Borough of Croydon.\n\nHooley until the early 20th century was a sparsely inhabited hamlet of Chipstead, both a largely permeable chalk upland area with little housing or industry. Both the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway and the South Eastern Railway recognised the construction of short tunnels here as the best route out of London to Brighton for their rival railway lines. The two very deep railway cuttings here have been the locations of many land slips over the years. Before these the 1805 extension of the Surrey Iron Railway, a horse-drawn plateway came through this pass. A bridge from this early plateway survives at the junction of Brighton Road with Dean Lane.\nIn 1965, upon the formation of Greater London, Hooley, along with Purley and Coulsdon, became part of the London Borough of Croydon. Some communities on the very edge of Greater London were allowed the option of returning to their former counties. Hooley voted to return to Surrey and was added to Banstead. In the same way, Farleigh, which was also then in Croydon, voted to leave and was added to Godstone.\n\nThe land equates to part of a western slope and a narrow pass which is the lowest road crossing point of the North Downs east of Westhumble/Mickleham in Mid-Surrey and west of Otford in Kent and avoids the height of the escarpment and steep south sides at neighbouring Reigate and Caterham.\n\nHooley consists of houses on either side of the Brighton Road plus some land to the west and is about half a mile south of the boundary of the London Borough of Croydon and about 2 miles south of Coulsdon.\n\nThe village has two petrol stations, a few shops, a newsagent, a village hall, a social club and bar, and a coffee shop.\n\nThe settlement is today distinct from Chipstead which is to the north west — St Margaret's the parish church of Chipstead, is in Hooley at the junction of Star and Church Lanes - ().\n\nTo the east, about a mile by a relatively steep, curved road, the early 21st century village of Netherne-on-the-Hill has established its own identity (in the former parish) on the site of the Victorian Netherne asylum for mentally ill people, expected to be completed by the 2020s.\n\nA large proportion of the secondary age children of Hooley attend Sutton Grammar School, in nearby Sutton.\n\nThe M23 motorway also terminates at Hooley, converting to a mixture of a single carriageway with verges and trees and a dual carriageway.\n"}

In 1969, Spain returned the region of Ifni to Morocco.\n\nMorocco gained independence in 1956, and the Istiqlal Party presented its vision for the new state's boundaries. These nationalists appealed to the idea of a Greater Morocco, based upon the territory of the Sharifian empire which preceded French and British colonization. This area included what was at the time Spanish Sahara, French West Africa, and French Algeria. The Moroccan state itself formally adopted the 'Greater Morocco' vision under Mohammed V in 1958. After Mauritanian and Algerian independence in the early 1960s, Morocco released claim to most of Greater Morocco. However, it has maintained its irredentist claim over Western Sahara.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Morocco succeeded in getting Spanish Sahara to be listed on the list of territories to be decolonized, and on 20 December 1966, United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2229 called on Spain to hold a referendum on self-determination in the territory.\n\nAfter initially resisting all claims by Morocco and Mauritania (which also started laying claims to parts of the region), Spain announced on 20 August 1974 that a referendum on self-determination would be held in the first six months of 1975 and took a census of the territory to assess the voting population .\n\nMorocco declared it cannot accept a referendum which would include an option for independence and renewed its demands for the integration of the remaining provinces of Saguia el-Hamra and Rio de Oro to the country's sovereignty . In Mauritania, a smaller movement claimed some of the territory, partitioning it with Morocco .\n\nAlgeria–Morocco relations had been strained since Algeria's independence in 1962, culminating in the Sand war, and a lack of normalized relations . Algeria, after initially supporting Morocco and Mauritania in their demands , started in 1975 to support the independence of the territory. Algeria officially supported the right of self-determination of the people of the former Spanish colony, as it had supported the right of self-determination of the peoples of the rest of the African colonized countries. The Polisario Front, created in 1973, engaged in several attacks against Spanish garrisons and patrols, and also attacked the Fosbucraa conveyor belt, which exported the rich local phosphates to the El Marsa port.\n\nOn 17 September 1974, King Hassan II announced his intention to bring the issue to the ICJ . In December, Spain agreed to delay the referendum pending the opinion of the court. They gave their support to ICJ submission on the grounds that it be a non-binding, advisory opinion, rather than a \"contentious issue\", where the ruling would oblige the interested states to act in a particular manner .\n\nOn 13 December, the United Nations General Assembly voted on a submission, resulting in UN General Assembly Resolution 3292, affirming it and defining the wording of the questions to be submitted. Algeria was among the nations voting in favor, and several Third World nations abstained.\n\nUN General Assembly Resolution 3292 requested that the International Court give an advisory opinion on the following questions:\n\nAnd, should the majority opinion be \"no\", the following would be addressed:\nIn the meantime, Morocco and Mauritania jointly agreed to not contest the issue of partition or sovereignty. On 16 January 1975, Spain officially announced the suspension of the referendum plan, pending the opinion of the court. From 12-19 May, a small investigative team made of citizens from Cuba, Iran, and Côte d'Ivoire was sent into the region to assess public support for independence. They also performed inquiries in Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and Spain.\n\nIn the summer, the questions were submitted by King Hassan II and Spain. Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and Spain were all given permission to present evidence at the hearings (the Polisario was locked out as only internationally recognized states have a right to speak - Algeria largely represented the Sahrawis). Twenty-seven sessions were held in June and July before the Court called the proceedings final.\n\nThe arguments presented by Morocco and Mauritania were essentially similar: that either one had a sovereign right over the territory. In the case of Morocco, the kingdom of Morocco claimed the allegiance of a variety of tribes in surrounding territory. In the case of Mauritania, there was no clearly defined state that existed at the time. Instead, Mauritania argued that a similar entity existed which they called \"bilad Chinguetti\". Spain argued against Moroccan sovereignty, citing the relationship that Spanish explorers and colonizers had established with the sultan, none of which ever recognized his authority over the region. Algeria also defended the position that the Sahrawis were a distinct people, and not under the subjection of Morocco or Mauritania.\n\nOn 15 October, a UN visiting mission sent by the General Assembly to tour the region and investigate the political situation published its findings, showing that the Sahrawi population were \"overwhelmingly\" in favor of independence from both Spain and Morocco/Mauritania. These findings were submitted to the Court, who published their opinion the next day.\n\nFor the former question, the Court decided by a vote of 13 to three that the court could make a decision on the matter, and unanimously voted that at the time of colonization (defined as 28 November 1884), the territory was not \"terra nullius\" (that is, the territory, did belong to someone).\n\nFor the latter question, the Court decided by a vote of 14 to two that it would decide. It was of the opinion, by 14 votes to two, that there were legal ties of allegiance between this territory and the Kingdom of Morocco. Furthermore, it was of opinion, by 15 votes to one, that there were legal ties between this territory and the \"Mauritanian entity\". However, the Court defined the nature of these legal ties in the penultimate paragraph of its opinion, and declared that neither legal tie implied sovereignty or rightful ownership over the territory. These legal ties also did not apply to \"self-determination through the free and genuine expression of the will of the peoples of the Territory.\" (ICJ Reports (1975) p. 68, para. 162)\n\nThe opinion of the Court was interpreted differently by the different parties, and each focused on what it sees as supporting its claims.\n\nWhile Morocco and Mauritania found in the answers to the two questions a recognition that their claims are legitimate and historically based, Algeria and the Polisario Front focused on the penultimate paragraph that stated that the court's decision was not to hinder the application of self-determination through the ongoing Spanish referendum.\n\nKing Hassan II declared the organisation of a peaceful march to force Spain to start negotiations on the status of the territory, to which Spain finally agreed. A round of talks between Spain, Morocco and Mauritania were held in Madrid and culminated in a tripartite agreement, becoming known as the Madrid Accords On 16 November 1975, where Spain formally ceded the administration of the northern two thirds of the territory to Morocco, while the southern third was to be administrated by Mauritania. Algeria protested against the agreement, and president Boumedienne retaliated by expelling all Moroccans living in Algeria. The text of the Madrid Accords have never been made public.\n\nIn consequence, the Court's decisions were largely disregarded by the interested parties. On 31 October 1975 the first Moroccan troops invaded Western Sahara from the north-east. Algeria sent its troops into the territory of Western Sahara to help in the logistic of the evacuation of the Sahrawi refugees who have been bombarded by Moroccan air forces, which led to the first and last direct military confrontation between units of the Moroccan armed forces and the Algerian national army in the First Battle of Amgala (1976). The Algerian army suffered hundreds of deaths and more than a hundred soldiers were made prisoners by the Moroccan army. Diplomatic intervention from Saudi Arabia and Egypt prevented the situation from escalating further.\n\nSpain's last soldier left the territory on 26 February 1976 . The next day, the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic was declared by Polisario Front representatives. Morocco intensified its military presence in the region, and by the end of the year, Mauritania and Morocco had partitioned the territory. Mauritania was too weak militarily and economically to compete against Polisario, though, and was forced to renounce its claims in 1979. Morocco immediately annexed that territory. Morocco has continued to administer most of Western Sahara, but its sovereignty has not been recognized by the UN or any country in the world. At the same time, 82 governments have recognized the Sahrawi Republic as the legitimate government of Western Sahara.\n\n\n\n"}

He is especially renowned for his last-to-first victory in the latter event, and remains the only horse to have ever won both cups. Kiwi raced from 1980 to 1987, and died in 1995 at the age of 18.\n\nKiwi was bred by Brian Fischer in Parore, New Zealand. He was bought by Waverley sheep farmer Snow Lupton and his wife Ann, for NZ$1000. They had previously owned a Blarney Kiss horse and therefore wanted another, with Ann's personal preference for it to have a chestnut hair coat.\n\nThough Kiwi showed promise as a racehorse, Lupton believed the horse would show strength as a distance runner. He proved this when Kiwi won the Wellington Cup from the rear of the field in a close finish.\n\nThe Wellington Cup is held in late January each year, and the Melbourne Cup in November. Even to this day, Kiwi is the only horse to have won both the Wellington Cup and Melbourne Cup consecutively. This historical feat is highly regarded, especially as the Melbourne Cup is esteemed as the premier staying race in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nWhen entered for the Melbourne Cup, despite having won over a 3200-metre distance, Kiwi was considered very much an outsider and started with odds of 10/1. As usual, Kiwi (ridden by jockey Jim Cassidy) settled at the very back of the 24-horse field. At the turn of the Flemington track, with 500 metres remaining, Kiwi was second to last (ahead of Amarant, which was running lame).\n\nWith a storming run through the field, Kiwi won the race by just over a length. The speed of his race caused many race commentators to only mention Kiwi as he neared the finish line...\"\"and here comes Kiwi out of the blue\"\". Kiwi's victory has become one of the most memorable performances in the history of the Melbourne Cup, especially as it illustrated a classic stayer's victory.\n\nOn winning the race, Kiwi became a household sporting hero in New Zealand, forming a key example of the underdog winning against the odds. It showed that a simple trainer, when equipped with a good horse, could win the greatest prize.\n\nAs incredible as it may seem for a champion horse, Lupton openly admitted that Kiwi was used to \"round up the sheep\" as part of his conditioning routine.\n\nKiwi entered the 1984 Melbourne Cup, but was controversially scratched due to a veterinary check. Lupton always maintained that Kiwi was fit for the race and could have won. The event sparked criticism of the scratching as a potential act of bad sportsmanship, due to the rivalry between New Zealand and Australia. Kiwi also ran in the 1985 Melbourne Cup, running fifth. In 1986, he once again looked to repeat his 1983 \"come-from-behind\" victory, but pulled up lame close to the finish line. Later that year, he represented New Zealand in the Japan Cup, running a creditable fifth.\n\nAfter his run in Japan, Kiwi was retired to the Luptons' farm, where he died and was buried in 1995. The headstone simply states: \"Kiwi, 1983 Melbourne Cup\". A plaque commemorating Kiwi is also located at the Waverley Racecourse.\n\nIn 2012, Australian rail operator CFCL Australia named locomotive CF4406 \"Kiwi\" after the horse.\n\n"}

He resided in both Shepherd Market, London and Cornwall. His Spanish partner Raúl Balín died in 2004.\n\nRaleigh Trevelyan was born in the Andaman Islands. India to Colonel Walter Raleigh Fetherstonhaugh Trevelyan, commander of the British Indian Army garrison at the penal settlement of Port Blair, and Olive Beatrice Frost Trevelyan. The family moved to Punjab, and then when he was six, the family trekked on horseback for three weeks to his father's new assignment in Gilgit, where Colonel Trevelyan was posted as military adviser to the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir. At the age of eight, like many children of the British Raj, Raleigh was packed off to a boarding prep school in England and rarely saw his parents after that.\n\nAfter leaving Winchester College in 1942, Trevelyan served in the Second World War in the Rifle Brigade and was sent first to Algiers and then to Italy. On 23 May 1944, during the breakout from Anzio, the Green Howards battalion to which he was attached lost 230 men, some of whose deaths he blamed on himself. Towards the end of 1944, back with the Rifle Brigade, Trevelyan got a job in the British military mission in Rome, where he remained for two years, falling in love with central Italy. His participation in the bloody Battle of Anzio, in which he was wounded twice, was the subject of two memoirs. \"The Fortress: A Diary of Anzio and After\" (1957), was recognized for his painfully honest account of how a soldier responds to the terror of being under fire. Later, with the help of German and Italian friends, Trevelyan wrote \"Rome ’44: The Battle for the Eternal City\" (1981), which provided a vivid account of what it had been like for soldiers and civilians on the other side of the conflict.\n\nAfter the war Trevelyan worked briefly in merchant banking, then became an editor at William Collins, Sons and later at Jonathan Cape and Michael Joseph, editing both fiction and nonfiction while writing his own books. Among Trevelyan's early popular books were several about Italy, including \"Princes Under the Volcano\" (1973), an account of the British role in Sicily in the 19th and 20th centuries; and \"The Shadow of Vesuvius\" (1976), about the discovery of the remains of Pompeii and Herculaneum in the 18th century. A 1978 book, \"A Pre-Raphaelite Circle\", viewed the major painters of the early Victorian avant-garde movement of the title through the prism of correspondence he found in the papers of Pauline Trevelyan, a distant relation by marriage who was a confidante and patron of the art critic and artist John Ruskin.\n\n\"The Golden Oriole\" (1987) combined a journal of Trevelyan's five journeys to the subcontinent with historical chronicle, genealogy, family photographs, memoirs and interviews, to trace his family's involvement across 200 years of British involvement in India. Notable were Sir William Macnaghten, the British Resident in Kabul whose beheading during the First Anglo-Afghan War prompted the 1842 retreat from Kabul and the Massacre of Elphinstone's Army and the ten Trevelyans who were among the hundreds of Britons massacred during the Siege of Cawnpore in the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Others ancestors discussed in the chronicle include Thomas Babington Macaulay who introduced English-medium education in India; Charles Trevelyan, reformer of the British Civil Service and later Governor of Madras and Indian Finance Minister; George Otto Trevelyan, the author of the classic, \"The Competition Wallah\" (1865); Humphrey Trevelyan, a British diplomat who became one of Jawaharlal Nehru's closest and most valued associates during the final preparations for Indian Independence; and, of course, his own parents.\n\nTrevelyan spent ten years retracing Walter Raleigh's footsteps for his best-known work, the acclaimed biography \"Sir Walter Raleigh\" (2002). The volume argued for the elevation of his distant ancestor and namesake to the upper reaches of the pantheon of British greats, based on Raleigh's achievements as an explorer, courtier, poet, American colonizer and early purveyor of tobacco to England and potatoes to Ireland. The book waded deep into the nuances of British, French and Spanish foreign policy to explain Raleigh's various acts of naval heroism and piracy; verified Raleigh's claims about silver and gold deposits in The Guianas (thought at the time to be wild fabrications); and brought Elizabethan court intrigues into focus to trace the events that led to Raleigh's years in the Tower of London and his beheading for treason in 1618.\n\n\n"}

Each military branch awards inter-service awards under the same criteria.\n\nThe World War I Victory Medal was the first inter-service award. This was followed by the Purple Heart,Silver Star Medal, Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross, and Air Medal decorations.\nPrior to this time, several older service medals had been issued both to the Army and Navy, but in different versions for each service. The World War I Victory Medal, Purple Heart, Silver Star, Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross, and Air Medal were thus the first medals which appeared identical, regardless of which service was bestowing the award.\n\nBy the end of World War II, several World War II service medals had also been established for issuance to both Army and Navy personnel. The United States Coast Guard also received such awards under the authority of the Department of the Navy. After World War II, The Korean Service Medal was the first inter-service non-decoration award which was awarded by all five branches of the U.S. Armed Forces; in 1947, the United States Air Force had been established as a separate branch of service. Since 1956, and 2010, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and Silver Star Medal may also be awarded by the Coast Guard.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the U.S. Armed Forces created the Meritorious Service Medal, and several campaign medals and service awards, all of which may be awarded by any service branch.\n\nThe United States Department of Defense in the 1960s and 1970s, also began creating a series of peacetime meritorious awards which were eligible for presentation to any military member working in a joint command or under the authority of the Secretary of Defense. The last such medal, the Joint Service Achievement Medal decoration, was created in 1983. The only inter-service unit award, the Joint Meritorious Unit Award was created in 1981.\n\nOn April 5, 2011, President Barack Obama amended Executive Order 12824 modifying the award eligibility of the Homeland Security Distinguished Service Medal to \"any member of the Armed Forces of the United States\" making it an inter-service award of the U.S. military. Recently, this decoration has been given to Gen Craig R. McKinley (USAF) for his service as Chief of the National Guard Bureau.\n\nThe Medal of Honor, originally a Navy award, is now technically an inter-service award, is issued in different versions for each branch of military service. There are presently three versions of the decoration in existence for the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Marines receive the Navy version of the Medal of Honor while a Coast Guard version, which exists in theory, has never been bestowed (the one Coast Guard recipient of the Medal of Honor received the Navy version).\n\nThe following are the various military medals of the United States which are considered inter-service awards and decorations. Medals are shown in categories, not in order of precedence for uniform wear.\n\n"}

The album is noted for its moody, dreamy, and fuzzed-out psychedelic sound, and was released by International Artists.\n\nThe album project commenced shortly after the completion of \"Easter Everywhere\", tentatively entitled \"Beauty and the Beast\" and later \"A Love That's Sound\". It featured not only the 1968 lineup of Roky Erickson, Stacy Sutherland, Tommy Hall, Danny Thomas, and Duke Davis, but Ronnie Leatherman on bass as well, who was brought back after the departure of Davis. The band was in the process of disintegrating while recording was taking place. Only four songs feature Roky Erickson and Duke Davis; only one features Tommy Hall. The remaining seven tracks only feature Sutherland, Thomas, and Leatherman. Most of the tracks recorded in the Spring of 1968 were discarded and the album was completed in the Fall of 1968. Guitarist Stacy Sutherland holds sole song writing credits on five tracks, co-writing a further four with Tommy Hall. It wasn't released until March 1969 as \"Bull of the Woods\", by which time the group had effectively disbanded.\n\nIn 2009, the album was released with bonus tracks as part of the \"Sign of the 3-Eyed Men\" box set. The set also included a reconstruction of the \"lost\" third album, \"A Love That's Sound\", which consisted of mostly previously unreleased tracks, and early versions of songs later included on Bull of the Woods.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2097735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097735", "title": "History of Lansingburgh, New York", "text": "History of Lansingburgh, New York\n\nThis is a history of Lansingburgh, New York.\n\nThe town of Lansingburgh was originally intended as the site for the principal city north of Albany on the east bank of the Hudson River; but the inhabitants of the settlement a mile or two south of New City (not to be confused with New City, a different city in New York known today by that name), as the village of Lansingburgh was first known, took advantage of the opportunities which presented themselves in rapid succession, and the prestige which in the natural order of things should have gone to Lansingburgh went to Troy, which rapidly outran its rival in the race for commercial supremacy in Rensselaer County.\n\nThe town of Lansingburgh is located on the western border of the county, north of the city of Troy and south of the town of Schaghticoke. On the east lie the towns of Pittstown and Brunswick and on the west the Hudson River, separating Lansingburgh from the northern part of Albany county and the southern part of Saratoga county. The site of the county was originally included in parts of two separate patents. The northern part of the town as at present constituted was set off from Schaghticoke in 1819 and forms a part of the Schaghticóke tract, occupied by the Schaghticoke Indians and set off to them in 1670. This territory afterward became the property of the city of Albany and was sold in 1707 to the Knickerbocker colony. The southern part of the town formed a part of the Stone Arabia patent.\n\nSoon after the Dutch began to make settlements in the vicinity of what is now Troy, Robert Saunders, a resident of Albany, was attracted to the level and fertile tract now in the town of Lansingburgh, and called by the Indians Tascamcatick, and the woodland to the south called Passquassick. September 1, 1670, Francis Lovelace, governor of the province of New York, granted the former tract to Saunders. March 22, 1679, Sir Edmund Andros, another governor, granted to Saunders the woodland, together with the small island in the Hudson called Whale island, since submerged by the construction of the State dam south of it. September 19, 1681, Saunders sold part of the woodland south of Piscawen kill to Peter Van Woggelum. May 26, 1683, Saunders sold the remaining portion of his patent, Tascamcatick, to Joannes Wendell, and the latter afterward purchased another piece of woodland which extended northward along the river to a creek called by the Indians Paensick kill. Wendell's land was confirmed to him July 22, 1686, by a patent granted by Governor Thomas Dongan and called Steene (Stony) Arabia patent, and for over a century the territory was known as Stone Arabia. June 21, 1763, Robert Wendell, a descendant and heir of Joannes Wendell, sold to Abraham Jacob Lansing, for 300 pounds, that portion of his property beginning opposite the middle branch of the Mohawk River and running thence eastward as far as the limits of the Stone Arabia patent, excepting that portion which had been sold to Simon Van Antwerp but then owned by William Rogers. A deed given by Stephen Van Rensselaer (one of the patroons) to Abraham Jacob Lansing, dated July 13, 1769, described the north bounds of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck and the south bounds of the Stone Arabia patent.\n\nThe number of settlers increased rapidly and Lansing, believing that his property would soon form the site of a thriving village, in 1771 had a portion of it surveyed and laid out into lots, with streets and alleys, by Joseph Blanchard, which he called Lansingburgh. The map showed 288 lots, and the ground it covered included that bounded by North, East and South streets and the Hudson River.\n\nOn January 1, 1771, the inhabitants of the settlement agreed upon a compact called the \"Proposals,\" for the government of the community, and chose civil officers. It was provided that there be annually elected a committee of five persons, a \"town clerk, a path-master, and three Fence Viewers, \"and that Abraham Jacob Lansing, or his heirs forever, should be one of the committee; At the first town meeting Ebenezer Marvin was elected moderator and Thomas S. Diamond clerk. The first committee comprised Abraham Jacob Lansing, Isaac Bogart, John Barber, Ebenezer Marvin, and Benjamin French. Abraham Wendell was chosen pathmaster, and Robert Wendell, Levinus Lansing, and Isaac Van Arnum fenceviewers.\n\nThe advantageous location of the new \"City of Lansingburgh\" attracted many persons from other localities, particularly from New England, and the embryo village grew rapidly. Small manufacturing establishments were started and mercantile and commercial houses were founded at a rate that gave great promise. In 1774 a school was founded by Maus R. Van Vranka, who also agreed to read one English and one Dutch - sermon on every Sunday in the' year, excepting four Sundays reserved for himself.\n\nWhen the inhabitants of Lansingburgh became aware of the fact that the relations between the American colonists and Great Britain had become strained almost to the point of rupture, they showed their patriotism by subscribing to a paper which read as follows, dated June 15, 1775: A General Association agreed to and subscribed by the Freemen Freeholders and Inhabitants of Lansingburgh and Patent of Stone Arabia.\n\nThat these men meant all that they said and promised is evidenced in the fact that, with very few exceptions, their names are found enrolled upon the following lists of militia maintained during the War of the Revolution. Some of the names are those of persons then residing outside the bounds of the town, but there is no record distinguishing them from residents of Lansingburgh.\n\nThe first Masonic lodge in Lansingburgh was Hiram lodge No. 35, F. & A. M., which was instituted upon a warrant granted August 16, 1787.\n\nThe growth of New City, as Lansingburgh was commonly called in contradistinction to the Old City (Albany), and the development of its various industries were so great that May 21, 1787, \"Claxton & Babcock in King street between Hoosick and South Streets,\" in answer to what they believed to be a demand for a local newspaper, brought out the first issue of the first newspaper published in Lansingburgh-the Northern Centinel and Lansingborough Advertiser. It was a weekly publication and the first newspaper printed within the limits of the territory now known as Rensselaer county. Strange as may seem, it did not contain a line of local news except the publishers' announcement to the public. Its contents consisted of several columns of European \"news\" three months old, a few brief items regarding events which had occurred nearly a month before in New York, Boston and Philadelphia, some miscellany and five advertisements. The publication at once became popular and circulated through a large territory north and east of Lansingburgh. The name \"Lansingborough,\" which appeared in the caption of the paper, was an error of the printers, but was not changed to Lansingburgh for several months.\n\nAt the time of the establishment of the Centinel every inhabitant of Lansingburgh expected that the village was destined to become a large and prosperous city. New buildings were erected on all sides and the demand for residences and stores could not be supplied at times. Not infrequently persons who came here to locate were compelled to go elsewhere temporarily. The transportation business between this and other points had grown to large proportions, and sailing craft of all descriptions came up to the southern part of the village, where they deposited their burdens and departed with new cargoes.\n\nThe expectations of the founder of Lansingburgh were more than met in its rapid development. In 1790, so numerous had become the population and so varied the business interests of the community, that it was deemed advisable to establish a more substantial form of government than the \"Proposals\" first agreed to. Consequently, April 5, 1790, the State Legislature passed an act to appoint trustees to take and hold certain lands therein mentioned, and for other purposes.\n\nSoon after a fire company was organized, and in 1791 the hand fire engine known as old No. 1 was purchased in Philadelphia.\n\nAbraham Jacob Lansingh; founder of Lansingburgh, died October 9, 1791, in the seventy second year of his age. His wife, Catherine Lansing, died the day before in the sixty-ninth year of her age. In the notice of his death printed in the American Spy October 14 he is referred to as \"the original proprietor of this town.\"\n\nThe \"Scotch Seceders,\" as they styled themselves, built a church in 1789 or 1790 on the ground later occupied by the brush factory of J. G. McMurray & Co. The Rev. John Gausman was pastor, but the society died out after a brief career.\n\nThe first post-office in Lansingburgh was established in June 1792. Up that date letters for Lansingburgh were sent to Albany and there sent to their destination by a stage line operated by Annanias Platt upon the authority of the Legislature. Stephen Gorham was made deputy postmaster in April 1791. He was succeeded in the summer of 1792 by John Lovett, who became the first postmaster of Troy.\n\nAs early as June 18, 1782, Rev. Brandt Schuyler Lupton preached in Lansingburgh, but he did not become the pastor of a congregation until November 3, 1758, being ordained on the third Sunday of that month as pastor of the Reformed Protestant Dutch church. The first church edifice was erected on the north-west corner of Richard and John streets and was used as a house of worship until 1832. The congregation continued in existence until the close of the 18th century. August 9, 1792, the First Presbyterian church was organized and the cornerstone of the building subsequently used by the congregation as a house of worship was laid July 5, 1793, by Rev. Jonas Coe, pastor of the united congregations of Lansingburgh and Troy.1 The church was dedicated the following year. It was built on the north end of the village green and its walks were made of brick imported from Holland by Levinus Lansing, which he originally intended to use in the construction of a residence for himself.\n\nThe Lansingburgh library was opened September 9, 1794, with William Bell as librarian. The library was incorporated by an act of the Legislature February 24, 1795.\n\nFebruary 10, 1795, the Legislature passed a law providing for. the paving of certain streets. in Lansingburgh and appointing John D. Dickinson, James Dole, Jonas Morgan, Annanias Platt, Nicholas Schuyler, John Keating and Benjamin Tibbits commissioners to direct the work of improvement. The streets directed to be paved were King street, leading from what was called South street to Richard Street; North street, leading from Queen street to Water street; and Hoosick street, leading from Queen street to Water street.\n\nThe first water works in Lansingburgh of which any information is in existence were constructed prior to or during 1795. In December of that year water was supplied to all persons desiring it, from aqueducts constructed and maintained by Luther Emes & Co.\n\nThe Lansingburgh academy was chartered by the Regents of the University February 20, 1796, in response to a petition signed December 24, 1795, by influential residents of the village.\n\nThe law erecting the village of Lansingburgh was soon found to be incomplete, uncertain and restricted.\n\nProvision was also made for the election of three assessors, a collector, treasurer and \"as many fire wardens as the trustees for the time being or the major part thereof may order and direct.\" The duties of the village officers were carefully defined.\n\nMarch 30, 1798, by act of the Legislature, Alexander I. Turner and Adonijah Skinner were given the exclusive right, for five years beginning May 1, 1798, to conduct a stage line between the village of Lansingburgh and the town of Hampton, Washington county, passing through the towns of Hebron, Salem and Granville.\n\nThe Lansingburgh Gazette made its initial appearance September 18, 1798, Gardiner Tracy being its first publisher. Before that time, in addition to the Northern Centinel and Lansingburgh Advertiser, the Federal Herald, the American Spy and the Northern Budget had been started.\n\nIn the reports of cases adjudicated in the Supreme Court of Judicature of the State of New York is recorded the decision in the case of Van Rensselaer against Dole, a unique proceeding for damages on account of alleged slander. The decision in the case was handed down in April 1800, and since that time at least one lawsuit of a similar nature has been decided in favor of the defendant, the decision being based upon the law as laid down by the presiding judge in the case of Van Rensselaer against Dole. The opinion and decision in the case, being so unusual, are quoted:\n\nVan Rensselaer against Dole. This was an action of slander. The declaration charging the defendant with speaking of the plaintiff and others, the following words: \"John Keating is as damned a rascal as ever lived, and all who joined his party and the procession on the 4th of July, (meaning the said John Van Rensselaer and the party and procession, in which the said John Keating acted as captain on the said 4th of July) are a set of blackhearted highwaymen, robbers, and murderers.\" The words were differently charged, with some additional expressions, in the other counts, but were in substance the same. Plea the general issue.\n\nThe limits of the village of Lansingburgh were again defined by the Legislature April 2, 1801, as follows: Beginning at a point in the division line between the counties of Albany and Rensselaer, opposite the mouth of the creek on which John D. Van Der Heyden's mill now stands, from thence running on a line due east to the foot of the first range of hills, thence northerly on a line along the foot of the said first range of hills, until said line strikes the north bounds of the farm of Cornelius Lansing, and on which the said Cornelius Lansing now lives, thence westerly along the north bounds of said farm, to the division line between the counties of Rensselaer and Saratoga, thence along the westerly line of the said county of Rensselaer to the place of beginning.\n\nBy this law, or amended charter of Lansingburgh, the inhabitants of the village were accorded additional privileges and new duties were defined for them. Provision was made for new village ordinances relative to markets, streets, drainage, fire department, liquor license and many other matters, all of which were left in the hands of the new trustees.\n\nThe structure which spans the Hudson River between Lansingburgh and Waterford, Saratoga county, known as the Union bridge, is distinguished as being the oldest wooden bridge in the United States. It stands intact today as strong apparently as in the early days of the century. When the bridge was constructed it was deemed a marvel of engineering skill. How the public looked upon the structure at that time is manifested by the elaborate character of the exercises which attended its opening.\n\nThe day was a holiday in Lansingburgh. A \"very numerous procession\" was formed at noon at Johnson & Judson's hotel and marched to the bridge, and thence across to Waterford, \"under the discharge of seventeen cannon,\" where a dinner had been provided at Van Schoonhoven's hotel at the expense of the stockholders of the bridge. Among the prominent persons in attendance were the governor, the secretary of state, the comptroller, \"and a large number of respectable gentlemen from Albany and the adjacent villages,\" who \"partook in much harmony and conviviality.\" The structure is long and thirty feet wide, comprising four arches, which are supported by three pillars and two abutments. It is owned by the Union Bridge company, of which Thomas A. Knickerbacker is president and John Knickerbacker treasurer.\n\nAs early as 1803 Rev. Laban Clark and Martin Ruter preached to Methodist congregations in Lansingburgh. Seven years later a house of worship was erected on the bank of the river at the foot of Elizabeth street and was occupied by the congregation until 1827. The church was regularly organized July 23, 1827, and February 15, 1828, the trustees of the society bought of Derick Lane the lot on the southwest corner of North and Queen streets, where a church was afterward erected. The first regular pastor was Rev. S. D. Ferguson.\n\nThe First Baptist society of Lansingburgh was organized June 11, 1803, and the first edifice was located on the corner of John and North streets.\n\nDuring the War of 1812 an artillery company, of which Reuben King was captain and Caleb Allen lieutenant, and which had been organized before that war, was sent to Ogdensburg, but was soon afterward sent home. When the draft was ordered for the 155th Regiment, in command of General Gilbert Eddy of Pittstown, one-fourth of the artillery company was required for service, but before the regiment had proceeded further than Granville hostilities had terminated and the regiment was dismissed. When Commodore Macdonough, the distinguished commander of the flotilla on Lake Champlain, visited Lansingburgh, April 8, 1815, on his way to New York, be was welcomed by a large concourse of citizens, headed by a committee, who presented to him a pair of handsome pitchers and a dozen goblets. The pitchers were inscribed on one side: \"Commodore T. Macdonough, with an. inferior force, captured the British squadron on Lake Champlain September 11, 1814;\" and on the other: \"Presented by the citizens of Lansingburgh - to the Hero of Lake Champlain.\" The goblets were inscribed: \"The citizens of Lansingburgh to Commodore Macdonough.\" The gift was acknowledged in a letter from Commodore Macdonough to the citizens' committee, consisting of James Hickok, David Smith, Elias Parmelee, John Topping, Elijah Janes, Gardiner Tracy, James Adams and James Reid.\n\nThe bank of Lansingburgh was incorporated March 19, 1813, beginning business at No; 531 State street, then King Street. The bank started with a capital of $200,000, of which $60,000 was paid in. Under the general banking law of 1838 reorganization was effected, and June 20, 1866, the name was changed to National Bank of Lansingburgh. March 9, 1869, it was changed back to a State bank and called- the Bank .of Lansingburgh. Its banking house was located on the northwest corner of State and Richard streets. After a career of sixty-four years the corporate existence of the Bank of Lansingburgh ceased March 19, 1877, its last president being Horace W. Day, vice-president Leonard J. Abbott, cashier Alexander Walsh, teller E. H. Leonard, and bookkeeper William C. Groesbeck.\n\nIn 1819 a portion of the town of Schaghticoke was annexed to Lansingburgh, which contains the hamlet of Speigletown, in the northeastern part of the town. This hamlet received its name from the Vanderspeigle families, early settlers of the southern part of the town of Schaghticoke.\n\nSoon after Hiram lodge, F. & A. M., ceased to exist, in September, 1822, a dispensation was granted for the institution of Phoenix lodge, which was organized in the following year. A history of the lodge will be found in a separate chapter dealing with Masonry in Rensselaer' county.\n\nThe First Universalist church was organized December 15, 1832, but it was not until the summer of 1834 that a small wooden house of worship was erected on the southwest corner of John and North streets. The society ceased to exist after a career of a few years and its church edifice was sold to St. John's Roman Catholic congregation. This congregation was organized in 1840 or 1841 and the church was dedicated in 1844 by Bishop McCloskey. St. Augustine's Roman Catholic church, erected in 1864 on the east side of John Street between Elizabeth and Market streets, at a cost of $40,000, was dedicated May 6, 1866, by Bishop Conroy of Albany. Rev. Thomas Galberry, O. S. A., was the first pastor. St. Augustine Free Institute was established December 13, 1869, by Rev. Thomas Galberry, Edward A. Dailey, Michael J. Collins, Ellen Wood and Mary Sullivan at the corner of John and North streets. It was afterward placed in charge of the Sisters of St. Joseph and its name was changed to St. Augustine's Free Institute.\n\nBy changes made in the bounds of the town by act of the Legislature in 1838, that portion of the village known as Batestown became a part of the city of Troy.\n\nLansingburgh was visited by its first serious fire Sunday, July 9, 1843, when nearly two entire blocks in the central part of the village were destroyed. The fire originated about 4 P. M. in the stables of the Rensselaer house and spread with great rapidity. The fire companies of Troy, Cohoes and Waterford responded to the call for assistance and their presence doubtless prevented the flames from destroying the entire village. About twenty five buildings were totally destroyed and several others damaged. The burned area was located between State and Congress streets and Elizabeth and Grove streets. Two weeks later, Sunday evening, July 23, about 10.30 o'clock, fire which originated in Jacock's barn destroyed about twelve more buildings.\n\nThe Rensselaer County bank was established January 1, 1853, with a capital stock of $200,000 by John S. Fake as president. It was converted into a national bank in June, 1865, but six years later it resumed its old title. It ceased to exist July 13, 1872.\n\nThe 30th Regiment, N. Y. State Vols., the history of which is contained in a preceding chapter, had its inception in Lansingburgh, the first full company for that regiment being organized in this village. It was mustered into the service of the United States as Company A, with Samuel King as captain, John H. Campbell as lieutenant and Francis Dargen as ensign. At the first battle of Bull Run Captain King, Ensign Dargen and five privates were killed. Lieutenant Campbell succeeded to the captaincy. The term of service of the company and the regiment was two years from June 6, 1861. Company K, 169th Regiment, was organized by Captain Daniel Ferguson and Second Lieutenant E. R. Smith. The former was killed at the explosion of the mine at Fort Fisher. The term of service of the company was three years from October 6, 1862. Captain Charles S. Holmes and First Lieutenant Cornelius Kelleher were members of Company C, 192nd Regiment.\n\nMarch 48, 1875, Justice Westbrook of the Supreme Court granted an order for the appointment of John P. Albertson as secretary of the Exchange Bank of Lansingburgh, and the following afternoon, with trucks and workmen, Isaac McConihe, president of the bank, with his counsel, John H. Colby, and Mr. Albertson, came to Lansingburgh from Troy and removed the safe, books, etc., loading them on the trucks and taking them to Mr. McConihe's office in Troy.\n\nIn 1882 Mrs. Deborah Powers, then ninety-three years of age, desired to devote a portion of her estate to the use of those who had been less fortunate, and she decided to found a home for aged women. April 10, 1883, she purchased the property now known as the Powers Home for Old Ladies, formerly called the Daniel Davenport homestead, which was remodeled and another story placed on both wings. The first inmate was received December 20, 1883. In 1884 the building was again enlarged. The grounds embrace a half block in the northern part of the village between Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth streets and Second and Third avenues.\n\nOn the morning of Wednesday, December 11, 1895, a small house on Second avenue, just below Sixth street, was burned, the flames causing the death of Mrs. Hannah Eglin Sliter and Mary Harris, the former a well-known resident of the village.\n\nWhen the public school system of the State was organized by the Legislature in 1807, Charles Selden and Thomas Wallace were chosen as the first school commissioners for Lansingburgh. Under the system of supervision by town superintendents in 1834, John G. Neal was elected to that office. In 1847 the Legislature passed an act permitting school district No. 1 of Lansingburgh to raise by taxation money enough, in addition to the public money, to establish a free school. This was one year before the free school system of the State was attempted by the Legislature, and four years before the fully developed system of 1851 was established. Prof. James C. Comstock was made principal of the new free school.\n\nThe Lansingburgh Academy is an old institution. The petition for its incorporation was signed December 24, 1795, by Benjamin Tibbits, William Bell and twenty-five others, and the charter was granted by the Regents February 20, 1796. The first building was erected on the site fronting the old \"green,\" which is now the village park. It was of wood, and in it the school was maintained for twenty-five years. A new building was erected in 1820 on the north side of Fourteenth street near Fourth avenue. In that building the school has since been maintained, and under the charter of 1796. The first principal of the academy was Chauncey Lee. Among those who received their early education at this time-honored institution were Chester A. Arthur, afterwards president of the United States; Judge John K. Porter, Thomas G. Alvord, and many others.\n\nThe fire department of Lansingburgh was organized by act of the Legislature April 17, 1844, with Thomas C. Davenport as the chief engineer. This volunteer fire department came to an end December 9, 1874, when a paid department was organized in accordance with an act of the Legislature, the first chief engineer being Thomas H. Mason; first assistant, John Franklin; foreman of hose, William M. Lea; assistant foreman, Milford Osborne; superintendent of steamers, John Brooks; assistant superintendent and engineer, Frank Spotten.\n\nUpon the failure of the Bank of Lansingburgh, the only one in the village, Albert E. Powers, son of Mrs. Deborah Powers, became its receiver. In order to facilitate the liquidation, the firm of D. Powers & Son opened a bank under the title of Bank of D. Powers & Sons, the other partner being Nathaniel B. Powers. the other son of Deborah Powers. From March, 1877, until the death of Deborah Powers May 28, 1891, the mother and sons jointly conducted the bank in connection with their oilcloth factory.\n\nThe factory was established many years before by Deborah Powers and her husband, William Powers. The couple were married February 23, 1816, while Mr. Powers was teaching school in Lansingburgh. Having been successful in experiments in the manufacture of this product, Mr. Powers abandoned teaching in 1821 and devoted his time from that time on to this industry. Mrs. Powers was her husband's active helper in all his experiments, both in counsel and labor. In 1828, the building they occupied being too small for the accommodation of the work, the factory now standing on the west side of Second avenue was erected. In 1829 Mr. Powers lost his life while making varnish and Mrs. Powers was also severely burned in the same accident. But she bravely determined to carry on the business, which she did with great success to the day of her death, amassing a great fortune. In 1842 Albert E. Powers was admitted into the business as his mother's partner, and five years later Nathaniel B. Powers became a member of the firm, Jonathan E. Whipple, who had become a partner in 1832, retiring. After the death of Mrs. Powers both the oilcloth manufactory and the bank continued under the ownership of the two sons.\n\nSince the failure of the Bank of Lansingburgh many years before no State or National incorporated banking institution had existed in Lansingburgh until 1888, when, October 19, it was decided by capitalists of the village to organize a bank with a capital stock of $68, 500, to be paid on February 12, 1889, with a limit of $250,000. Subsequently the capital stock was reduced to $50,000 and these officers were elected: President, J. K. P. Pine; vice-president, Robert C. Haskell; cashier, Edward Van Schoonhoven. The bank was named the People's Bank of Lansingburgh, and the lot No. 604 Second avenue was purchased for a site for a banking building, for $2,000. Ground was broken November 2, 1889, and the bank began business in the following February.\n\nThe Leonard hospital was incorporated in 1893, and the institution has since been under the direction of the State Board of Charities. The property was formerly owned by Mrs. Hugh L. Rose, who was a daughter of Dr. Leonard, and when she died she directed that the building should be devoted to the purposes of a hospital. Her wishes were fulfilled and the institution was named in honor of her father. It is located on the northeast corner of Fourteenth street and Sixth avenue, and the grounds surrounding it extend from Sixth to Seventh avenues and from Fourteenth to Fifteenth streets. The building is a two-story brick structure and well adapted to the purposes for which it is used.\n\nReference has been made to the establishment of the First Presbyterian church. The second church edifice was commenced in 1844 and opened for service April 25, 1845. In 1866 and 1867 a commodious chapel was erected at a cost of $8,000, and since then the church has been enlarged and remodeled at a cost of $20,000. The work was completed in the summer of 1870 and the edifice, then practically a new one, was dedicated, the sermon being preached by the Rev. An son J. Upson, D. D.\n\nThe Methodist Episcopal church of Lansingburgh was organized July 23, 1827. The first house of worship was constructed at the foot of Elizabeth street near the river. A class had been formed as early as 1798, and in 1803 Rev. Laban Clark and Martin Ruter preached. In 1810 a house of worship was erected, and in 1828 and 1829 a church was built at the corner of North and Queen streets. Rev. S. D. Ferguson was the first stated pastor, though others had preceded him before the society became organized in due form. In 1848 a new church was built on the northeast corner of Elizabeth and Congress streets, which has been enlarged and remodeled. The society has always been a prosperous one.\n\nThe John Street Baptist church was organized June 11, 1803, and the first church edifice was on the east side, of State street between Hoosick and Lansing streets. September 6, 1804, the work of erecting a larger and more convenient church was begun on the northwest corner of Congress and Richard streets. This building subsequently became the property of the Second Presbyterian society and was known as Olivet .church. It later was given over to secular uses. The John Street Baptist church, having labored under heavy financial difficulties, was finally dissolved in 1857 and the church edifice was sold to satisfy a mortgage. The society was reorganized July 28, 1858, with A. B. Whipple as pastor. The edifice formerly occupied by the Second Presbyterian church on John street was purchased and improved, and soon after occupied.\n\nThe Second Presbyterian church, later named Olivet, was organized in 1835, as the First Free Presbyterian Society of Lansingburgh. Soon after organization had been effected a brick church was erected on the east side of John street, between Elizabeth and Richard streets. The first pastor was the Rev. Samuel P. Spear, and during his ministry the name of the organization was changed to that of the Second Presbyterian church of Lansingburgh. May 17, 1861, the congregation having been reorganized as Olivet church, it purchased the property formerly owned by the Baptist church, located on the northwest corner of Congress and Richard streets. In 1877 a chapel was erected on the northeast corner of Clinton and Congress streets.\n\nTrinity Protestant Episcopal church was organized January 5, 1804, and the first house of worship was erected on the corner of Market and John streets. The first rector was the Rev. Dr. David Butler, who served St. Paul's at Troy at the same time. The church was destroyed by fire on Christmas morning, 1868, but was rebuilt almost immediately, being ready for occupancy within two years. The new edifice cost about $60,000.\n\nThe Reformed Presbyterian church of Troy and Lansingburgh was incorporated December 21, 1831, but in the following year sold its property and disbanded.\n\nThe Universalist church was organized in 1833, its edifice being located on the corner of North and John streets and its first pastor being the Rev. Charles Woodhouse. The society did not prosper and ultimately sold its property to St. John's Roman Catholic church and went out of existence.\n\nSt. John's church was the first Roman Catholic church to be established in Lansingburgh. Its first house of worship was the building purchased of the Universalist society, located on the corner- of North and John streets, which, after being repaired, was consecrated by Bishop McCloskey in 1844 as \"The Catholic Church of the Village of Lansingburgh.\" The first pastor was the Rev. W. P. Hogan. For a while it was known as St. Joseph's church. The new church was built in 1864 and given the name of St. Augustine's.\n\nThe African Methodist Episcopal church was incorporated May 18, 1846, and after a career of twenty-five years it ceased to exist. The society maintained services at No. 549 Whipple avenue.\n\nThe Free Methodist church was established in 1866 and its house of worship on Ann street, south of Elizabeth, was dedicated November 15, 1867. The first pastor was the Rev. George E. Ferrin.\n\nThe Germondville Union church of North Lansingburgh, incorporated July 23, 1844, occupied during its career the house of worship afterwards owned by the Methodist church at Speigletown.\n\nThe English Evangelical Lutheran church of the Redeemer started with four persons, John Knudsen and wife and John H. Lingenfelter and wife. During the summer of 1889 Paul Klingler, a student in the Lutheran Theological seminary at Philadelphia, Pa., spent his vacation in an effort to gather together the anglicized Lutherans living in Lansingburgh, and succeeded in gathering fifty or sixty men, women and children. The time having arrived for Mr. Klinger to return to his studies in the seminary, the little flock was left without a shepherd. In the month of October Rev. Samuel G. Finckel came from Hartleton, Pa., to organize a congregation. In December about a score of members were incorporated, bought a lot and started a church, the cornerstone of which was laid about March 1, 1890. The building was completed and opened for service in May, 1890.\n\nAmong the other leading organizations in Lansingburgh, the Sans Souci Yacht club was organized October 12, 1867; the Lansingburgh Choral union was organized March 20, 1879.\n\nThe population of Lansingburgh is composed largely of persons whose business is located in Troy, but the village sustains several manufacturing concerns which contribute greatly to its wealth and prosperity. Even while Troy was yet a comparatively small village Lansingburgh enjoyed an immense trade with Vermont and Northern New York in grain, beef, pork, butter, cheese and other produce. There were many commission merchants or \"middle-men\" in the village. In the beginning of the 19th century there were at least a dozen warehouses on River street for storing grain. Lansingburgh was then the centre of a great grain trade, buying of the farmers for many miles around and selling at Albany, New York and other cities. About 1825, and even before that date, there were several leather tanneries in operation in the village. Frederick Forsyth, Keating Rawson, Cornelius Lansing, Asa Burt and William Guest owned the most important of these. There were also a number of slaughter and packing houses, among them being those of Ives & Wilson, Tobias Loring, Noel Atwood and Thomas Turner. Before the year 1800 there were four or five \"ship yards\" in town, where sailing vessels for navigation on the Hudson were made. Armington & Hawkins and John Stilson were prominent in this line. The oilcloth industry has been a prominent one for many years. Reference to the factory of D. Powers's Sons has been made in preceding pages. P. C. Davenport, Jonathan E. Whipple and Ferrin engaged in the business at an early day. Caswell's rifle factory began business about 1812 or 1813. Twentyfive men were employed for many years in the three shops. Brush manufacturing was also an early industry, David McMurray being the pioneer in the business. All of his five sons-William, John G., Robert, David and Moses-were engaged in the same business. Large numbers of persons were employed in the various works for many years.\n\nEdwin Chamberlain established a carriage factory in 1836, in Troy, removing to Lansingburgh in 1858. The business developed to large proportions and gave employment to a number of skilled workmen.\n\nThe Ludlow Valve Manufacturing company, which was located for many years in Lansingburgh, made preparations in 1896 to move to Troy and occupy a part of the former plant of the Troy Steel company in the southern part of the city. The plant was originally established in Waterford, but was removed to Lansingburgh in 1872, remaining in the village for twenty-four years. One of the earliest grist mills in town was started about 1785 or 1790 by Levetsee, near the Brunswick line. There were also several other grist mills and a number of lumber mills in town. Sherrill & Hedges had a nail factory in the village, and Fisher & Co. conducted a thread factory for a few years.\n\nJames McQuide began the manufacture of brushes about 1855, and eleven years later he erected a large brick building for use as a factory. Subsequently he admitted his son, Joseph McQuide, to the business under the firm name of James McQuide & Son. Sweney & Bradshaw began the manufacture of brushes in 1857. The firm afterward became Bradshaw & O'Bryan, and finally John G. O'Bryan became sole pro. prietor. The brush factory of George Scott was established in 1842. E. & C. Woods began the manufacture of brushes about 1843. The Rensselaer Valve works, now located in Cohoes, were founded in Lansingburgh in 1853 by P. Southwick. S. V. Arnold subsequently became interested in the business. In 1879 S. V. Arnold & E. L. Rowe came into possession, and not long afterward the energies of the proprietors were turned toward the manufacture of valves. The factory employs a large number of experienced workmen. Edward Tracy was the founder of the big malt house in Lansingburgh, said to be one of the largest in the country. Bilbrough's knitting mill, founded in Cohoes in 1854 as a cotton yarn factory, was removed to Lansingburgh about 1880. Cross & Hoyt established a brush factory in the village in 1833. Frederick M. Hoyt succeeded to the business in 1858. Milford L. Fancher established an insurance business about 1858. The Cold Spring ale brewery was founded early in the century by John Topping. A brush factory was started in 1874 by James Reed. About 1875 A. Faden began the manufacture of carriages and sleighs. Owen Denuin began the manufacture of brushes in 1874, and Curran & Barker entered the same line of business in 1875.\n\nThe greatest modern industry in Lansingburgh is that conducted by the United Shirt & Collar company. This concern was formed by the consolidation of the houses of James K. P. Pine, S. A. House's Sons, Sanford & Robinson, Beiermeister & Spicer and Marshall & Briggs, and was incorporated May 7, 1890, with a capital of $2,000,000. July 1 of that year it began business with these officers: President, Samuel B. Sanford; vice-presidents, Frederick Beiermeister, jr., David C. Briggs; treasurer, James K. P. Pine; secretary, Edward 0. House. The manufactories which comprise this giant concern had all been in business for several years, and the new corporation became at once one of the greatest in the world. The company started with three factories-one in Lansingburgh, located on the corner of Second avenue and Twenty-first street; the Anchor factory, at Nos. 509, 511 and 513 River street, Troy, and the factory on the corner of Fifth avenue and Broadway, Troy.\n\nOne of the largest manufacturing industries in Lansingburgh is that of S. Bolton's Sons, located on the west side of Second avenue in the Fourth ward. It is known as the Eagle brewery and is one of the most important ale and porter breweries of Northern New York. The firm now consists of Samuel Bolton, jr., and Joseph Bolton, brothers. Samuel Bolton, jr., is the business head while his brother attends to the practical end of the business. The establishment has gained a high reputation and its output is enormous. Employment is given to a large number of hands. Samuel Bolton, jr., is one of the prominent citizens of the village. He is interested in the banking business and his real estate holdings are large, the firm being among the largest taxpayers of the village. The business was established in 1865 by the father of the present members of the firm, who came from England. From a small beginning it has grown to its present proportions and produces for its owners large fortunes.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2097760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097760", "title": "Stylometry", "text": "Stylometry\n\nStylometry is the application of the study of linguistic style, usually to written language, but it has successfully been applied to music and to fine-art paintings as well. Another conceptualization defines it as the linguistic discipline that applies statistical analysis to literature by evaluating the author's style through various quantitative criteria.\n\nStylometry is often used to attribute authorship to anonymous or disputed documents. It has legal as well as academic and literary applications, ranging from the question of the authorship of Shakespeare's works to forensic linguistics.\n\nStylometry grew out of earlier techniques of analyzing texts for evidence of authenticity, author identity, and other questions.\n\nThe modern practice of the discipline received major impetus from the study of authorship problems in English Renaissance drama. Researchers and readers observed that some playwrights of the era had distinctive patterns of language preferences, and attempted to use those patterns to identify authors in uncertain or collaborative works. Early efforts were not always successful: in 1901, one researcher attempted to use John Fletcher's preference for \"⁠ ⁠’em\", the contractional form of \"them\", as a marker to distinguish between Fletcher and Philip Massinger in their collaborations—but he mistakenly employed an edition of Massinger's works in which the editor had expanded all instances of \"⁠ ⁠’em\" to \"them\".\n\nThe basics of stylometry were set out by Polish philosopher Wincenty Lutosławski in \"Principes de stylométrie\" (1890). Lutosławski used this method to build a chronology of Plato's Dialogues.\n\nThe development of computers and their capacities for analyzing large quantities of data enhanced this type of effort by orders of magnitude. The great capacity of computers for data analysis, however, did not guarantee quality output. In the early 1960s, Rev. A. Q. Morton produced a computer analysis of the fourteen Epistles of the New Testament attributed to St. Paul, which showed that six different authors had written that body of work. A check of his method, applied to the works of James Joyce, gave the result that \"Ulysses\", Joyce's multi-perspective, multi-style masterpiece, was written by five separate individuals, none of whom apparently had any part in the crafting of Joyce's first novel, \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.\"\n\nIn time, however, and with practice, researchers and scholars have refined their approaches and methods, to yield better results. One notable early success was the resolution of disputed authorship in twelve of \"The Federalist Papers\" by Frederick Mosteller and David Wallace. \nWhile questions of initial assumptions and methodology still arise (and, perhaps, always will), few now dispute the basic premise that linguistic analysis of written texts can produce valuable information and insight. (Indeed, this was apparent even before the advent of computers: the successful application of a textual/linguistic approach to the Fletcher canon by Cyrus Hoy and others yielded clear results in the late 1950s and early '60s.)\n\nApplications of stylometry include literary studies, historical studies, social studies, gender studies, and many forensic cases and studies. It can also be applied to computer code. Stylometry can also be used to predict whether someone is a native or non native English speaker through their typing speed.\n\nStylometry as a method is vulnerable to the distortion of text during revision. There is also the case of the author adopting different styles in the course of his career as was demonstrated in the case of Plato, who chose different stylistic policies such as the those adopted for the early and middle dialogues addressing the Socratic problem.\n\nModern stylometry draws heavily on the aid of computers for statistical analysis, artificial intelligence and access to the growing corpus of texts available via the Internet. Software systems such as Signature (freeware produced by Dr Peter Millican of Oxford University), JGAAP (the Java Graphical Authorship Attribution Program—freeware produced by Dr Patrick Juola of Duquesne University), stylo (an open-source R package for a variety of stylometric analyses, including authorship attribution, developed by Maciej Eder, Jan Rybicki and Mike Kestemont) and Stylene for Dutch (online freeware by Prof Walter Daelemans of University of Antwerp and Dr Véronique Hoste of University of Ghent) make its use increasingly practicable, even for the non-expert.\n\nStylometric methods are discussed in several academic fields, mostly as a tangential field of application as with machine learning, natural language processing, and lexicography.\n\nThe International Association of Forensic Linguists (IAFL) organises the Biennial Conference of the International Association of Forensic Linguists (13th edition in 2016 in Porto) and publishes \"The International Journal of Speech, Language and the Law\" with forensic stylistics as one of its central topics.\n\nThe Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) has hosted several events on subjective and stylistic analysis of text.\n\nPAN workshops (originally, plagiarism analysis, authorship identification, and near-duplicate detection, later more generally workshop on uncovering plagiarism, authorship, and social software misuse) organised since 2007 mainly in conjunction with information access conferences such as ACM SIGIR, FIRE, and CLEF. PAN formulates shared challenge tasks for plagiarism detection, authorship identification, author gender identification, author profiling, vandalism detection, and other related text analysis tasks, many of which hinge on stylometry.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince stylometry has both descriptive use cases, used to characterise the content of a collection, and identificatory use cases, e.g. identifying authors or categories of texts, the methods used to analyse the data and features above range from those built to classify items into sets or to distribute items in a space of feature variation. Most methods are statistical in nature, such as cluster analysis and discriminant analysis, are typically based on philological data and features, and are fruitful application domains for modern machine learning approaches.\n\nWhereas in the past, stylometry emphasized the rarest or most striking elements of a text, contemporary techniques can isolate identifying patterns even in common parts of speech. Most systems are based on lexical statistics, i.e. using the frequencies of words and terms in the text to characterise the text (or its author). In this context, unlike in information retrieval, the observed occurrence patterns of the most common words are more interesting than the topical terms which are less frequent.\n\nThe primary stylometric method is the writer invariant: a property held in common by all texts, or at least all texts long enough to admit of analysis yielding statistically significant results, written by a given author. An example of a writer invariant is frequency of function words used by the writer.\n\nIn one such method, the text is analyzed to find the 50 most common words. The text is then broken into 5,000 word chunks and each of the chunks is analyzed to find the frequency of those 50 words in that chunk. This generates a unique 50-number identifier for each chunk. These numbers place each chunk of text into a point in a 50-dimensional space. This 50-dimensional space is flattened into a plane using principal components analysis (PCA). This results in a display of points that correspond to an author's style. If two literary works are placed on the same plane, the resulting pattern may show if both works were by the same author or different authors.\n\nStylometric data are distributed according the Zipf-Mandelbrot law. The distribution is extremely spiky and leptokurtic, reason why researchers had to turn their backs to statistics to solve e.g. authorship attribution problems. Nevertheless, usage of Gaussian statistics is perfectly possible by applying data transformation.\n\nNeural networks, a special case of statistical machine learning methods, have been used to analyze authorship of texts. Text of undisputed authorship are used to train the neural network through processes such as backpropagation, where training error is calculated and used to update the process to increase accuracy. Through a process akin to non-linear regression, the network gains the ability to generalize its recognition ability to new texts to which it has not yet been exposed, classifying them to a stated degree of confidence. Such techniques were applied to the long-standing claims of collaboration of Shakespeare with his contemporaries Fletcher and Christopher Marlowe, and confirmed the view, based on more conventional scholarship, that such collaboration had indeed taken place. \nA 1999 study showed that a neural network program reached 70% accuracy in determining authorship of poems it had not yet analyzed. This study from Vrije Universiteit examined identification of poems by three Dutch authors using only letter sequences such as \"den\".\n\nA study used deep belief networks (DBN) for authorship verification model applicable for continuous authentication (CA).\n\nOne problem with this method of analysis is that the network can become biased based on its training set, possibly selecting authors the network has more often analyzed.\n\nThe genetic algorithm is another machine learning technique used in stylometry. This involves a method that starts out with a set of rules. An example rule might be, \"If \"but\" appears more than 1.7 times in every thousand words, then the text is author X\". The program is presented with text and uses the rules to determine authorship. The rules are tested against a set of known texts and each rule is given a fitness score. The 50 rules with the lowest scores are thrown out. The remaining 50 rules are given small changes and 50 new rules are introduced. This is repeated until the evolved rules correctly attribute the texts.\n\nOne method for identifying style is called \"rare pairs\", and relies upon individual habits of collocation. The use of certain words may, for a particular author, idiosyncratically entail the use of other, predictable words.\n\nThe diffusion of Internet has shifted the authorship attribution attention towards online texts (web pages, blogs, etc.) electronic messages (e-mails, tweets, posts, etc.), and other types of written information that are far shorter than an average book, much less formal and more diverse in terms of expressive elements such as colors, layout, fonts, graphics, emoticons, etc. Efforts to take into account such aspects at the level of both structure and syntax were reported in. In addition, content-specific and idiosyncratic cues (e.g., topic models and grammar checking tools) were introduced to unveil deliberate stylistic choices.\n\nStandard stylometric features have been employed to categorize the content of a chat over instant messaging, or the behavior of the participants, but attempts of identifying chat participants are still few and early. Furthermore, the similarity between spoken conversations and chat interactions has been neglected while being a key difference between chat data and any other type of written information.\n\n\n\nSee also the academic journal \"Literary and Linguistic Computing\" (published by the University of Oxford) and the \"Language Resources and Evaluation\" journal.\n\n"}

Norden had already done some preliminary work, but got entangled in war-service for England and died in France 1742 of tuberculosis, before anything was ready. He left his documents and drawings to his friend.\n\nMark Tuscher from Nuremberg made the drawings into copperplates for the publication.\n\nNorden published some test drawings from his voyage in 1741, under the long name \"Drawings of Some Ruins and Colossal Statues at Thebes in Egypt, with an account of the same in a Letter to the Royal Society\".\n\nA very often-used extract from this book is Norden's drawing of the Great Sphinx of Giza. As the first near realistic drawing of the sphinx, he is the earliest known to draw the Sphinx with the nose missing. Although Richard Pococke in the same year visits and later publishes a stylish rendering (in \"A Description of the East and Some other Countries\", 1743), he draws it with the nose still on. Pococke's drawing is a faithful adoption of Cornelis de Bruijn's drawing of 1698 (\"Voyage to the Levant\", 1702, English trans.), featuring only minor changes.\n\nIt is highly unlikely if the nose was still on that Norden out of free fantasy would leave it out. This drawing is often used to disprove the story that Napoleon I of France destroyed the nose of the sphinx.\n\n\n\n"}

Masao Kimura is a veteran racer with more than 50 victories in Honda sports cars and single-seaters and worked for Honda R&D and then Honda Racing Service before helping Hirotoshi Honda establish Mugen.\n\nIn 1973, Mugen started its operations and initially offered special parts of motocross bikes. As Honda expanded its vehicle lineup, Mugen's product range also expanded. The company started specializing in tuning Honda engines. Beginning with the 1200 cc Honda Civic engine, it went on to develop, and now designs and builds, both two-stroke and four-stroke engines, manufacturing many of the major components itself.\n\nMugen ultimately intends to build its own road cars and the first step towards this was the creation of bodykits for the Honda Ballade CR-X in 1984. Since then, the company has produced a number of body kits for Honda machinery, culminating with the Mugen NSX prototype in 1992.\n\nFollowing Hirotoshi Honda's tax evasion allegation in late 2003, Mugen was restructured in early 2004 with the establishment of M-TEC. The new company retained the right to use the Mugen trademark and its headquarters in Asaka, Saitama, in the northern suburbs of Tokyo close to the Honda R&D facility at Wako. Although it is a legally separate entity, M-TEC kept Mugen's existing staff and is headed by former Mugen board member Shin Nagaosa, who was the engineering division manager at Mugen and been involved with running Mugen's NSX racing program.\n\nWorking with Honda, Mugen has gradually expanded its sporting involvement to all levels of the sport. In 1986, Formula 3000 was introduced into Japan and Mugen joined forces with Honda to build an F3000 engine. It was introduced in the 1987 season and leased to 14 teams. The following year, Mugen won four of the top five places in the Japanese F3000 championship. In 1989, Mugen entered European F3000 with the MF308 engine and won the championship with Jean Alesi, driving an Eddie Jordan Racing Reynard. The same year the company produced its own prototype 3.5L  V8 Formula One engine, codenamed MF350.\n\nIn 1988, Mugen started tuning Honda engines for use in Formula Three, winning the Japanese series with Akihiko Nakaya, and in 1990 expanded their business to Europe. The same year, Mugen won its first Formula Three championships in Europe, taking the French title with Éric Hélary, and the British crown with Mika Häkkinen at the wheel of a West Surrey Racing Ralt, which repeated the title in 1991 with Rubens Barrichello.\n\nAs F3000 became a spec-series in Europe starting in 1996 with the Lola-Judd combo, the Japanese series responded by making Mugen the sole supplier to the Japanese championship, now redubbed Formula Nippon. M-TEC lost the supply contract for the 2006 season, with the rules changing to allow Toyota associate TOM'S to join Mugen as engine supplier.\n\nMugen continues to enjoy success in the Formula Three circuit with its tuned 2.0 L Honda engines, having won 9 titles in Asia (8 of which in Japan) since 1988, as well as 19 titles in Europe (15 of them in Britain), and 13 in Latin America.\n\nAs of 2017, Mugen Formula engines still enjoy use and success across the various European hillclimb championships, employed in former Formula chassis and dedicated hillclimb prototypes.\n\nIn 1991 Mugen prepared Honda V10 engines for Tyrrell but the following year these engines were renamed Mugen MF351H and were transferred to the Footwork team, with drivers Aguri Suzuki and Michele Alboreto.\n\nAt the end of 1992 Honda pulled out of Formula One due to the global recession, despite this however Mugen continued participation in Formula One from 1993 onwards using Tuned Honda engines.\n\nIn 1993, Mugen remained affiliated with Footwork and created a B version of the MF351H, used by Aguri Suzuki and Derek Warwick.\n\nAt the end of the year, Mugen switched to Team Lotus with plans for a new Lotus 109. The team - with drivers Johnny Herbert and Pedro Lamy (later replaced by Alessandro Zanardi) - was underfunded and the 109 chassis was late arriving. The Mugen engine, codenamed ZA5C, was not able to show its full potential, the team consequently failed to score a single World Championship point during 1994 despite coming close on 3 occasions, this was the only season in which Mugen engines did not score a World Championship point during their time in Formula One.\n\nAfter Lotus closed at the end of the year, Mugen switched to the Ligier team, which was then being run for Flavio Briatore by Tom Walkinshaw, with drivers Olivier Panis, Martin Brundle and Aguri Suzuki. The 3.0 L engine, conforming to the new regulations, was codenamed MF301H. The 1995 season was promising with points being scored at 9 races and the team securing 2 podiums, one courtesy of Martin Brundle finishing 3rd at the Belgian Grand Prix and the other by Olivier Panis finishing 2nd at the Australian Grand Prix, the team secured 24 points and finished a respectable 5th in the Constructors Championship, The following season with Ligier resulted in Mugen's first Formula One victory as well as Ligier's last ever Formula One victory at the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix with Panis at the wheel, despite this unexpected success the Mugen powered Ligier car was only able to score 3 more points finishes during the rest of the season two 6th-place finishes from Pedro Diniz and one 5th-place finish from Panis, the team suffered 17 retirements during 1996.\n\nLigier was taken over by Alain Prost in 1997, and the newly named Prost Grand Prix ran MF301H-B engines with Jarno Trulli leading the Austrian Grand Prix before suffering engine failure, the Prost team managed two Podium finishes during the 1997 season at Brazil and Spain, they scored points in 8 races over the season securing a final total of 21 points and a 6th-place finish in the Constructors Championship\n\nWith Prost establishing a relationship with Peugeot and switching to them from 1998 onwards, Mugen looked for a new partner and reached a two-year agreement with Jordan Grand Prix for which Mugen produced the MF301H-C engine. The first half of the 1998 season was an absolute disaster, it was so bad that at one point the owner of Mugen or Honda met with Eddie Jordan and his team during the 1998 Monaco Grand Prix to find out why up until then the team had failed to score a single World Championship point, the relationship continued, at Silverstone the team scored their first World Championship point of the season courtesy of a 6th-place finish from Ralf Schumacher, from Britain onwards the team scored further points finishes at the next 3 races, it was not until Spa-Francorchamps, when Jordan's fortunes changed for the better, the drivers Damon Hill and Ralf Schumacher scored a 1-2 finish securing Jordan's first ever Formula One victory and their only 1-2 finish during their existence. The team would score points on 2 further occasions with Ralf Achieving a 3rd-place finish at the Italian Grand Prix.\n\nThe 1999 season resulted in further success with Heinz-Harald Frentzen winning twice in France and Italy, however due to better performances from Mclaren and Ferrari the Mugen powered Jordan cars were unable to challenge for both championships, sometime during the 1999 season the Honda Motor Company announced that it would be returning with its own engines from 2000 onwards with British American Racing. As a result, due to Honda's return Mugen chose to pull out of F1 at the end of the 2000 season which left Honda to supply the engines to Jordan as well from 2001 onwards.\n\nIt is Unknown whether despite using the Honda name between 1991 and 2000 that Mugen were possibly funded by Honda themselves during this time period, Mugen's success in the late 1990s led to Honda's Formula One return in 2000, between 1991 and 2000 Mugen engines won 4 races, 1 with Ligier in 1996 and 3 with Jordan, 1 in 1998 and 2 in 1999. Mugen managed 16 Podium finishes during their time in Formula One and scored a grand total of 182 points with the various teams that they were associated with.\n\nIn 1998, Mugen built four NSX models, two for the Mugen/Dome partnership, one for Team Kunimitsu and one for Nakajima Racing. The cars were fast but unreliable at first, until the Nakajima NSX scored the car's first win at the fourth round in Fuji. This was followed by three more wins (one of them by the Mugen/Dome team), which led to a second place championship finish for Tom Coronel and Kouji Yamanishi. In 1999, the Honda took three more wins, one of those with the Mugen/Dome team of Juichi Wakisaka and Katsutomo Kaneishi scoring a victory at the opening round in Suzuka and finishing the third best team in the championship. In 2000, the Mugen/Dome team was champion with Ryo Michigami, but the car's performance was limited by regulation changes and Michigami reached the title without a single win. Still, Honda won four races, one of them by the second Mugen/Dome car.\n\nIn 2001, Mugen concentrated once more in the JGTC, the NSX winning two races, and finishing second (Mugen/Dome) and third (ARTA) in the series. More importantly, in June, the company announced development of a new 4.0 L V8, dubbed MF408S, for the main prototype class in the 24 Hours of Le Mans and American Le Mans Series. At the time, Mugen acknowledged that international sportscar racing was a new category for them. The concept of the MF408S was high power, compact size, durability and reliability. Mugen chose a 4.0 L (N/A) Naturally aspirated engine because they felt through their experience in Formula Three that restrictor size was key to performance. The idea was to save fuel with a smaller displacement engine, since, theoretically, restrictor size will bring power in any engine to a similar level. The main engines in use at the time were producing around 600 hp, including the turbocharged Audi and Cadillac, as well as the larger displacement BMW and the Roush-prepared Ford. Mugen excluded a turbo as this necessitated use of intercoolers to extract maximum performance, which added to the weight and reduced performance.\n\n2002 was a good year for Mugen at the track. The Mugen-prepared NSXs won five rounds, with the Mugen/Dome team winning two races outright, which gave them the Team's championship title. The debut of the MF408S was in a Panoz chassis in the 2002 Sebring 12 Hours, first round of ALMS.\n\nIn 2004, M-TEC decided to drop down to GT300 and help train Japanese drivers for GT500 speeds. By grabbing promising drivers early in their careers, M-TEC would then be able to mold them and have definite access to future champions. M-TEC driver, Hiroyuki Yagi, was sourced from the Integra Series. Giving the drivers experience was more important than developing the car to take the championship. To this end, M-TEC simply detuned the car for the GT300 class without optimizing it for the new power level. Winning the GT300 series by one point over the ARTA Garaiya was simply an unintended bonus for a dedicated, championship-level team.\n\nBreaking into the United States is another goal for the M-TEC team and the Mugen name. Currently, the authorized dealer of Mugen parts in the US is King Motorsports. Team director Junichi Kumakura thought racing the NSX in the United States was a great way to promote the company in a previously unvisited environment. When asked what else M-TEC would like to accomplish in America with the golden NSX, competing at Sebring and Daytona were marked as attractive goals.\n\n\nEngine Name: MF458S\n\nMugen have become the dominant force in electrically powered motorcycles competing at the Isle of Man TT Races. In the eight years since their introduction into the TT Zero, the average speed of the Mugen Shinden around the Snaefell Mountain Course has increased from in 2012 to in 2019. By 2019, Mugen has won five TT Zero races using its Shinden bikes.\n\nMaking their competitive debut at the 2012 Isle of Man TT, John McGuinness took the Mugen Shinden Ni to second place behind the MotoCzysz of Michael Rutter at an average speed of 109.527 mph.\nAt the 2013 TT Mugen again finished runners up to MotoCzysz, with Rutter and McGuinness repeating the previous year's result.\nMugen's development has continued at subsequent races in the TT Zero Category. Fielding two machines at the 2014 Isle of Man TT, John McGuinness secured their maiden victory ahead of teammate Bruce Anstey who took second place on the other Shinden San. \nAt the 2015 TT McGuinness and Anstey again took the first two spots on the rostrum.\nMugen continued their dominance in the TT Zero class at the Isle of Man TT Races in 2016, when Bruce Anstey took the honours, although their other machine, ridden by John McGuinness, retired during the one lap event.\nAnstey and Guy Martin came first and second respectively, both riding Mugen machines.\nThe Mugen motorcycles achieved first and third place with Michael Rutter and Lee Johnston respectively, split by Daley Mathison riding for the University of Nottingham. Rutter broke the 120 mph barrier to set a new lap record of .\n\n2019\n\nWith Shinden Hachi, Mugen achieved their sixth consecutive victory with Michael Rutter again increasing the lap record average speed to 121.91 mph. John McGuinness followed his team-mate home to complete a 1-2 finish for the team.\n\nM-Tec has also built concept Honda vehicles, using the company's own performance parts. Some models (e.g.: Mugen Civic RR) are also sold in Japanese domestic market.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was born and raised in Rye, New York, the daughter of concert singer Elizabeth Poole-Jones and classical pianist, Frank Sheridan. While best known for her role as Jerry's mother in \"Seinfeld\", her decades-long career is extensive and includes work as a dancer, singer, and actress of stage and screen.\n\nSheridan began her professional life in New York City and the Caribbean as a nightclub dancer and singer, moving on to stage work. She was cast in Broadway productions throughout the 1970s, both in musicals and plays. Sheridan co-starred with Meryl Streep and Christopher Lloyd in the 1977's musical, \"Happy End\", before moving to Los Angeles. Working in Hollywood, she came to prominence in supporting roles in over a dozen feature films and 60 prime time network television movies, mini-series, and series including \"Kojak\", \"Archie Bunker's Place\", \"St. Elsewhere\", \"Newhart\", \"Moonlighting\", \"The A-Team\", \"Who's the Boss\", \"Hill St. Blues,\" \"Cagney & Lacey\", \"Family Ties\", and \"Murder, She Wrote\". Her first major role was playing nosy neighbor Raquel Ochmonek on the NBC TV series \"ALF\", from 1986 to 1990. Following that she secured her most renowned and long-lived role, as Jerry's mother, Helen, in \"Seinfeld\". She appeared in all nine seasons, from 1990 to 1998.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, she lived and worked in the Caribbean, \"singing and playing the piano in almost every bar and saloon in the West Indies.\" In the late 1960s, back in New York, she performed in one of Julius Monk's annual cabaret reviews at Plaza 9, located in the Plaza Hotel. \n\nIn 2009, with Andy Griffith and Doris Roberts, Sheridan co-starred in the feature film \"Play the Game\", a romantic comedy about a lonely, widowed grandfather who, after a 60-year hiatus, learns dating tricks from his serial romancer of a grandson. The film stirred up controversy due to its octogenarian sex scene between Sheridan and Griffith.\n\nWhile working as a dancer in New York City nightclubs, Sheridan met the then-unknown James Dean. She wrote a book, \"Dizzy & Jimmy: My Life with James Dean: A Love Story\", chronicling their time together in 1952. In it, she describes them as each other's first romantic love. \"We had great times... We didn't want to be apart. We found a place and lived together... [b]efore he really hit it big.\" Dean pursued work on the stage in New York, with film roles in Hollywood soon to follow. Without sure footing or a serious plan, forging a future was not an option, thus bringing about the end of their relationship. \"He was being hauled away into this career, and I couldn't follow him,\" she said in an interview. \n\nEarly in 1953, Sheridan departed New York for the Virgin Islands. She lived for over a decade in St. Thomas and later Puerto Rico. She earned a living as a dancer and also by singing and playing piano. Together with a neighbor who had a dance troupe, she won a dance contest she choreographed for the first Carnival in St. Thomas. She also earned a six hundred dollar purse finishing first in a horse race, atop her mare, Generalé. After a brief engagement to a man, Justus Villa (aka Pancho), she realized she didn't want to marry him, broke it off, and returned, for a time, to New York City. There, at a party, she again met up with Dean. Afterwards, in a cab, he told her, \"Nothing's lost between us. It never will be. You're a part of me and I'm a part of you. I take you with me wherever I go.\" That was the last time she saw him. Back in the Caribbean, in Puerto Rico, she met jazz musician [William] Dale Wales (1917–2003) in Puerto Rico. They shared a life from 1960 until his death; they wed in 1985. Their daughter is a photographer living in New York City's Greenwich Village.\n\nLiz Sheridan and actress Elizabeth Montgomery were best friends: Dizzy and Lizzie. Montgomery only took on the nickname \"Lizzie\" following her performance in the Emmy Award winning TV movie, \"The Legend of Lizzie Borden\"; Dizzy was a shortened version of \"Dizabeth,\" which is how her sister managed to pronounce her name when they were young.\n"}

It grew out of the Te Aute Students Association, established by former students of Te Aute College in 1897. It was established as the Young Māori Party in 1909.\n\nWhile the Young Māori Party had political intentions, it did not function as a political party as they are generally understood. The Young Māori Party's members either acted as independents or joined an existing party, such as the New Zealand Liberal Party. In most respects, the Young Māori Party is best understood as a club or association, not a united electoral bloc. Anthropologist and author Toon Van Meijl said of the group \"the Young Maori Party's programme generated a basic division within Maori society between a relatively small educated elite and a predominantly illiterate mass of poor people\".\n\nThe membership of the Young Māori Party consisted primarily of younger Māori who had received a European-style education. Many were from the East Coast or the Bay of Plenty. Prominent members included James Carroll, Paraire Tomoana, Āpirana Ngata, Te Rangi Hīroa (who was a founding member), and Maui Pomare. The most important concern of the group was the improvement of Māori health and welfare.\n\nMost members of the Party believed that in order to prosper, Māori needed to adopt European ways of life, particularly Western medicine and education. At times, especially earlier in their careers, they offended older and more traditional Māori by attempting to abolish traditional practices. Later they developed more sensitivity and tended to present Western ways as similar to pre-European traditions. Ngata in particular also realised that Māori culture was in danger of being corrupted or swamped by European culture, and encouraged the revival of many Māori arts and crafts, such as kapa haka and carving. He also recorded many waiata and other forms of Māori literature, ensuring its preservation.\n\nAs it was a group of like-minded politicians rather than a true party, the Young Māori Party did not survive the retirement, defeat and deaths of its members. Hiroa left parliament in 1914, and by 1930 Carroll and Pomare had both died. Ngata remained in parliament until 1943, when he was defeated by Labour-Ratana candidate Tiaki Omana.\n\nThe Party was widely admired by Pakeha, who saw their programmes as advancing the Maori race, and by contemporary Māori, who benefitted from their initiatives and admired their ability to work within Pakeha systems. From the 1970s, however, a new generation of activist Māori began to see the Young Māori Party as 'sell outs' who had swallowed the myth of European cultural superiority. They believed that the Party was mistaken in believing that if Māori adopted European ways, they would be treated as equals. Recently this perception has been revised by historians such as Ranginui Walker and James Belich, who emphasise the achievements of the Party, especially Ngata, and stress that their strategy of co-operation was effective in the context of its time.\n"}

Mouse is an American surreal humour and psychological thriller animated television series created by Matt Maiellaro for Cartoon Network's late-night programming block, Adult Swim. The series revolves around Mouse Fitzgerald, nicknamed \"Fitz\" (voiced by Maiellaro), an alcoholic mouse who performs odd jobs so he can buy more beer. Together with his chinchilla companion Skillet, Fitz begins to recover suppressed memories that he once had a wife and a child who have now vanished. This leads him to seek answers about his past and the shadowy forces that seem to be manipulating his world.\n\nIn producing the series, Maiellaro crudely designed the characters as a cost-cutting measure; the series is animated by Radical Axis. He intended for the series to lack continuity starting from the pilot, but established a serial format after starting the second episode. He had constructed an ending for the series as well as a detailed map of characters; however, the series finale concluded differently from planned. Maiellaro cast people around his office for the characters, starring himself as the protagonist and Nine Pound Hammer vocalist Scott Luallen as the voice of Roostre; the band also performs the opening theme.\n\nThe pilot episode for \"12 oz. Mouse\", \"Hired\", premiered on June 19, 2005. The series became a regular staple of Adult Swim's lineup on October 23 of that year, and ended on December 17, 2006. Critical reception was polarized; some praised the series' experimental nature, while others felt confounded by it.\n\nThe June 14, 2018 episode of the Adult Swim streaming series \"Development Meeting\" featured a new clip from \"12 oz.

It was later announced on September 18 of that year that the series would return for a half-hour special entitled \"Invictus\", which aired a month later on October 14. On the day of the special's airing, another announcement was made that the series will return for a 10-episode third season which will air in 2020. On March 31, 2020, the third season premiere aired unannounced at 2:45 AM EST with many other new episodes from Adult Swim shows as part of Adult Swim's annual April Fools Prank. The whole third season will air in Summer 2020.\n\nThe show revolves around a mouse named Mouse Fitzgerald (voiced by Matt Maiellaro), nicknamed \"Fitz\", who is fond of beer and caught in a world of espionage, love, and the delights of odd jobs. The show employs a serial format, and its ongoing storyline developed from absurdist comedy to include mystery and thriller elements. Fitz begins to recover suppressed memories that he once had a wife and a child who have now vanished. This leads him to seek answers about his past and the shadowy forces that seem to be manipulating his world.\n\nFitz suspects there is a sinister conspiracy which appears to revolve around fields of \"\" pills beneath the city, and Shark (Adam Reed), Clock, and Rectangular Businessman's (Kurt Soccolich) attempts to control the nature of time and reality. Fitz and Skillet receive help from Liquor (Matt Harrigan), Roostre (Scott Luallen), Stoned Peanut Cop (Nick Weidenfeld) and others as they engage in gun battles, blow things up, and try to understand cryptic hints. The show also sometimes contains surreal \"subliminal\" images that flash across the screen during key plot moments, including skulls, mustached snake beasts and people screaming.\n\nThe series concludes with the revelation that Fitz has been kidnapped and placed into a simulation by the Shadowy Figure. He is about to be killed by Shark and the Rectangular Businessman, in their true forms outside the simulation, when he is rescued by the true form of Peanut Cop and a nurse who works in the simulation chamber. They kill Shark and Rectangle Businessman, but it is unknown if they are truly dead because the simulation in which most of the show takes place is probably taking place in another simulation. One of the purposes of the simulation seen in most of the show was to extract information from Fitz. The conclusion to episode 20 is ambiguous as to whether or not it is actually the end of the series, as some aspects of the plot remain unresolved – Golden Joe says \"I thought this was done,\" to which Fitz replies, \"I thought so too. I guess we're not.\"\n\nOne webisode was made in 2007, showing Fitz and his friends escaping the city to live in a desert. Golden Joe is carried away by birds, while later one night, Peanut Cop mysteriously disappears. Fitz and Skillet later meet a woman, Lee, who turns out to be a werewolf. Their fate at the end of the episode was unknown.\n\nIn 2018, a half-hour special episode aired, which continued the story. Fitz, now with a mustache and suffering from amnesia, is shown to be living in a new city during an unspecified amount of time after the original finale. Shark and Square Guy have returned somehow, and are trying to kidnap Fitz so they can return to the \"real\" world with the help of exterminator bee, Buzby (Dana Snyder). Skillet, Roostre, Peanut Cop, Golden Joe, and The New Guy (Mike Lazzo) must find and escape the simulation with Fitz before Shark and Square Guy do. The story is to continue in the third season, which is set to air in 2020.\n\nAccording to Maiellaro, the series was pitched as a table read to the network. He jokingly stated that they accepted it after claiming that production costs would total \"five dollars and will take some of the paper sitting in the copier.\" Maiellaro borrowed inspiration from surrealism and the films of David Lynch. He intended for the series to lack continuity starting from the pilot, but established a serial format after starting to work on the second episode. He had constructed an ending for the series as well as a detailed map of characters; however, the series finale concluded differently from planned. In November 2006, Maiellaro mentioned the possibility of continuing the series with webisodes, and he wrote five additional scripts for ending the series, but finally, he only produced one webisode, entitled \"Enter the Sandmouse\".\n\nRadical Axis provided animation for the series using Final Cut Pro. Described as \"lo-fi animation\", Maiellaro crudely designed the characters as a cost-cutting measure, with the exception of Amalockh, a many-armed monster summoned in the season two episode \"Corndog Chronicles\", which was drawn and animated by Todd Redner at the studio, and Shark, which was borrowed from the \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" episode \"Kentucky Nightmare\". In a behind-the-scenes clip of the show, Maiellaro explained that to animate the series, he would first grab a nearby sheet of copy paper, draw something, and then scan it, followed by him sending the file to an animator. Rhoda, a character from the series, was drawn on the back of a script page for \"Perfect Hair Forever\". A scan of the paper revealed the textual contents behind it, which Maiellaro decided to leave in.\n\nMaiellaro cast people around his office to voice the characters. He provides the voice of the protagonist, Mouse Fitzgerald. He originally only gave the scratch dialogue for the character during production of the pilot episode, but chose himself to voice Mouse regularly after hearing his lines assembled in the final cut. Kurt Soccolich was chosen by Maiellaro to voice Rectangular Businessman, who \"already had that sort of smooth arrogance in his voice\", making him a \"perfect\" fit for him. Matt Harrigan was selected to voice Liquor, who is \"always looking to make light of a situation\", according to Maiellaro.\n\nNick Weidenfeld provides the voice of Peanut Cop; Melissa Warrenburg portrays an annoying woman in a green sweater, who Maiellaro dubs \"Robogirl\". Bonnie Rosmarin voices Man/Woman, picked for what Maiellaro stated is a \"pouty, stand-offish quality\" in her delivery. Nick Ingkatanuwat voices The Eye and Adam Reed plays Shark. Vocalist of Nine Pound Hammer Scott Luallen voices Roostre; the band also composed the opening theme song for the series. Golden Joe is voiced by Vishal Roney; after hearing his first take on the character, Maiellaro explained that he was left unable to write any of his lines. He proceeded to only provide the basic structure of his lines in the script, instructing him to retroscript the rest.\n\nMaiellaro spent three weeks working with Ingkatanuwat on putting together the set for the opening title sequence. The set was filmed with a motion control camera, and was inserted with miniature explosives and smoke bombs for special effect. Nine Pound Hammer composed the opening theme song; Maiellaro sought for a song representing the \"carefree\" lifestyle of Mouse who \"does things like drive drunk, film porno and shoot guns.\" Maiellaro, who plays the electric guitar in his free time, also composed the song \"F-Off\", featured in both the first episode and in \"Auraphull\", which he wrote while working on \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\". Swedish heavy metal band Amaranthe performed the credits theme song for the 2018 special, \"Invictus\".\n\nThe pilot episode for \"12 oz. Mouse\", \"Hired\", premiered in June 2005 and became a regular series in the Adult Swim lineup in October 2005. An Adult Swim bumper shown with the sixth installment claimed that twenty additional episodes were being produced and taunted viewers who had complained they couldn't understand the absurdist presentation. On December 31, 2005, a marathon of the series aired, replaying all six episodes followed by the premiere of the then-unfinished seventh episode \"Adventure Mouse\". The second season aired on Adult Swim on Monday mornings at 12:45 a.m. EST from September 24, 2006 to December 17, 2006. On May 16, 2007, the 21st episode, entitled \"Enter the Sandmouse\", premiered as a webisode. On October 14, 2018, a half-hour special titled \"Invictus\" premiered on TV after having been released online two days earlier. Simultaneously, Adult Swim announced the series would be returning for a third season. The third season premiered unexpectedly on March 31, 2020 as part of that year's Adult Swim's April Fools Prank.\n\nThe season two episodes, \"Auraphull\" and \"Meat Warrior\", were respectively seen by 460,000 and 431,000 viewers upon broadcast. In addition, the episodes ranked as the thirteenth and twelfth most watched episodes aired by the network for the week of October 23, 2006, also respectively.\n\nThe series has received generally positive critical reception; About.com's Nancy Basile gave the series four out of five stars, opining that the series is \"what Adult Swim should be ... experimental, but in a cheap, simple, not-trying-to-be-cool way.\" She found the crude animation \"refreshing\" but joked that the series \"can kill\" viewers not used to the slow pace. Writing for AOL TV, Adam Finley regarded the show as \"the most simplistically drawn of all the Adult Swim shows, and yet the most complex in terms of story.\" He contrasted it with other Williams Street productions, finding it to \"instead unravels slowly, revealing a little bit more of what's underneath the surface while also piling on more and more questions.\" Rob Mitchum of Pitchfork Media called it \"the asymptote of the block's crude style\".\n\nJustin Heckert of \"Atlanta\" magazine opined that \"the animation and art look like they were done by daycare students\".\n\nThe hip hop duo Danger Doom have produced a song inspired by \"12 oz. Mouse\" entitled \"Korn Dogz\" from their EP \"Occult Hymn\". The song uses audio clips from the episode \"Rooster\", with the line \"Corn dogs for the pickin'\" being recited by Danger Doom's MC MF Doom and Mouse Fitzgerald. A scene from the episode \"Sharktasm\" is visible in \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters\".\nA DVD release of the complete series was released February 29, 2008 (leap year), exclusively on the Williams Street shop. The DVD cover depicts Leonardo's \"The Last Supper\" with the series' characters replacing Christ and the twelve apostles. However, under a black light, the cover depicts the skeletons of the characters, as well as letters and symbols which make out an email address. The series is presented as a single, continuous movie, with newly produced footage bridging the gaps between episodes. It also features production footage, new music, the episode \"Auraphull\" in its entirety and collected fan art.\n\n"}
{"id": "2097807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097807", "title": "Pitot-static system", "text": "Pitot-static system\n\nA pitot-static system is a system of pressure-sensitive instruments that is most often used in aviation to determine an aircraft's airspeed, Mach number, altitude, and altitude trend. A pitot-static system generally consists of a pitot tube, a static port, and the pitot-static instruments. Other instruments that might be connected are air data computers, flight data recorders, altitude encoders, cabin pressurization controllers, and various airspeed switches. Errors in pitot-static system readings can be extremely dangerous as the information obtained from the pitot static system, such as altitude, is potentially safety-critical. Several commercial airline disasters have been traced to a failure of the pitot-static system.\nThe pitot-static system of instruments uses the principle of air pressure gradient. It works by measuring pressures or pressure differences and using these values to assess the speed and altitude. These pressures can be measured either from the static port (static pressure) or the pitot tube (pitot pressure). The static pressure is used in all measurements, while the pitot pressure is used only to determine airspeed.\n\nThe pitot pressure is obtained from the pitot tube. The pitot pressure is a measure of ram air pressure (the air pressure created by vehicle motion or the air ramming into the tube), which, under ideal conditions, is equal to stagnation pressure, also called total pressure. The pitot tube is most often located on the wing or front section of an aircraft, facing forward, where its opening is exposed to the relative wind. By situating the pitot tube in such a location, the ram air pressure is more accurately measured since it will be less distorted by the aircraft's structure. When airspeed increases, the ram air pressure is increased, which can be translated by the airspeed indicator.\n\nThe static pressure is obtained through a static port. The static port is most often a flush-mounted hole on the fuselage of an aircraft, and is located where it can access the air flow in a relatively undisturbed area. Some aircraft may have a single static port, while others may have more than one. In situations where an aircraft has more than one static port, there is usually one located on each side of the fuselage. With this positioning, an average pressure can be taken, which allows for more accurate readings in specific flight situations. An alternative static port may be located inside the cabin of the aircraft as a backup for when the external static port(s) are blocked. A pitot-static tube effectively integrates the static ports into the pitot probe. It incorporates a second coaxial tube (or tubes) with pressure sampling holes on the sides of the probe, outside the direct airflow, to measure the static pressure. When the aircraft climbs, static pressure will decrease.\n\nSome pitot-static systems incorporate single probes that contain multiple pressure-transmitting ports that allow for the sensing of air pressure, angle of attack, and angle of sideslip data. Depending on the design, such air data probes may be referred to as 5-hole or 7-hole air data probes. Differential pressure sensing techniques can be used to produce angle of attack and angle of sideslip indications.\n\nThe pitot-static system obtains pressures for interpretation by the pitot-static instruments. While the explanations below explain traditional, mechanical instruments, many modern aircraft use an air data computer (ADC) to calculate airspeed, rate of climb, altitude and Mach number. In some aircraft, two ADCs receive total and static pressure from independent pitot tubes and static ports, and the aircraft's flight data computer compares the information from both computers and checks one against the other. There are also \"standby instruments\", which are back-up pneumatic instruments employed in the case of problems with the primary instruments.\n\nThe airspeed indicator is connected to both the pitot and static pressure sources. The difference between the pitot pressure and the static pressure is called dynamic pressure. The greater the dynamic pressure, the higher the airspeed reported. A traditional mechanical airspeed indicator contains a pressure diaphragm that is connected to the pitot tube. The case around the diaphragm is airtight and is vented to the static port. The higher the speed, the higher the ram pressure, the more pressure exerted on the diaphragm, and the larger the needle movement through the mechanical linkage.\n\nThe pressure altimeter, also known as the barometric altimeter, is used to determine changes in air pressure that occur as the aircraft's altitude changes. Pressure altimeters must be calibrated prior to flight to register the pressure as an altitude above sea level. The instrument case of the altimeter is airtight and has a vent to the static port. Inside the instrument, there is a sealed aneroid barometer. As pressure in the case decreases, the internal barometer expands, which is mechanically translated into a determination of altitude. The reverse is true when descending from higher to lower altitudes.\n\nAircraft designed to operate at transonic or supersonic speeds will incorporate a machmeter. The machmeter is used to show the ratio of true airspeed in relation to the speed of sound. Most supersonic aircraft are limited as to the maximum Mach number they can fly, which is known as the \"Mach limit\". The Mach number is displayed on a machmeter as a decimal fraction.\n\nThe variometer, also known as the vertical speed indicator (VSI) or the vertical velocity indicator (VVI), is the pitot-static instrument used to determine whether or not an aircraft is flying in level flight. The vertical speed specifically shows the rate of climb or the rate of descent, which is measured in feet per minute or meters per second. The vertical speed is measured through a mechanical linkage to a diaphragm located within the instrument. The area surrounding the diaphragm is vented to the static port through a calibrated leak (which also may be known as a \"restricted diffuser\"). When the aircraft begins to increase altitude, the diaphragm will begin to contract at a rate faster than that of the calibrated leak, causing the needle to show a positive vertical speed. The reverse of this situation is true when an aircraft is descending. The calibrated leak varies from model to model, but the average time for the diaphragm to equalize pressure is between 6 and 9 seconds.\n\nThere are several situations that can affect the accuracy of the pitot-static instruments. Some of these involve failures of the pitot-static system itself—which may be classified as \"system malfunctions\"—while others are the result of faulty instrument placement or other environmental factors—which may be classified as \"inherent errors\".\n\nA blocked pitot tube is a pitot-static problem that will only affect airspeed indicators. A blocked pitot tube will cause the airspeed indicator to register an increase in airspeed when the aircraft climbs, even though actual airspeed is constant. (As long as the drain hole is also blocked, as the air pressure would otherwise leak out to the atmosphere.) This is caused by the pressure in the pitot system remaining constant when the atmospheric pressure (and static pressure) are decreasing. In reverse, the airspeed indicator will show a decrease in airspeed when the aircraft descends. The pitot tube is susceptible to becoming clogged by ice, water, insects or some other obstruction. For this reason, aviation regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recommend that the pitot tube be checked for obstructions prior to any flight. To prevent icing, many pitot tubes are equipped with a heating element. A heated pitot tube is required in all aircraft certificated for instrument flight except aircraft certificated as Experimental Amateur-Built.\n\nA blocked static port is a more serious situation because it affects all pitot-static instruments. One of the most common causes of a blocked static port is airframe icing. A blocked static port will cause the altimeter to freeze at a constant value, the altitude at which the static port became blocked. The vertical speed indicator will read zero and will not change at all, even if vertical speed increases or decreases. The airspeed indicator will reverse the error that occurs with a clogged pitot tube and cause the airspeed to be read less than it actually is as the aircraft climbs. When the aircraft is descending, the airspeed will be over-reported. In most aircraft with unpressurized cabins, an alternative static source is available and can be selected from within the cockpit.\n\nInherent errors may fall into several categories, each affecting different instruments. \"Density errors\" affect instruments metering airspeed and altitude. This type of error is caused by variations of pressure and temperature in the atmosphere. A \"compressibility error\" can arise because the impact pressure will cause the air to compress in the pitot tube. At standard sea level pressure altitude the calibration equation (see calibrated airspeed) correctly accounts for the compression so there is no compressibility error at sea level. At higher altitudes the compression is not correctly accounted for and will cause the instrument to read greater than equivalent airspeed. A correction may be obtained from a chart. Compressibility error becomes significant at altitudes above and at airspeeds greater than . \"Hysteresis\" is an error that is caused by mechanical properties of the aneroid capsules located within the instruments. These capsules, used to determine pressure differences, have physical properties that resist change by retaining a given shape, even though the external forces may have changed. \"Reversal errors\" are caused by a false static pressure reading. This false reading may be caused by abnormally large changes in an aircraft's pitch. A large change in pitch will cause a momentary showing of movement in the opposite direction. Reversal errors primarily affect altimeters and vertical speed indicators.\n\nAnother class of inherent errors is that of position error. A position error is produced by the aircraft's static pressure being different from the air pressure remote from the aircraft. This error is caused by the air flowing past the static port at a speed different from the aircraft's true airspeed. Position errors may provide positive or negative errors, depending on one of several factors. These factors include airspeed, angle of attack, aircraft weight, acceleration, aircraft configuration, and in the case of helicopters, rotor downwash. There are two categories of position errors, which are \"fixed errors\" and \"variable errors\". Fixed errors are defined as errors which are specific to a particular model of aircraft. Variable errors are caused by external factors such as deformed panels obstructing the flow of air, or particular situations which may overstress the aircraft.\n\nLag errors are caused by the fact that any changes in the static or dynamic pressure outside the aircraft require a finite amount of time to make their way down the tubing and affect the gauges. This type of error depends on the length and diameter of the tubing as well as the volume inside the gauges. Lag error is only significant around the time when the airspeed or altitude are changing. It is not a concern for steady level flight.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2097814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097814", "title": "Air data computer", "text": "Air data computer\n\nAn air data computer (ADC) is an essential avionics component found in modern aircraft. This computer, rather than individual instruments, can determine the calibrated airspeed, Mach number, altitude, and altitude trend data from an aircraft's pitot-static system. In some very high speed aircraft such as the Space Shuttle, equivalent airspeed is calculated instead of calibrated airspeed.\n\nThe first air data computer patented in the US was developed by John H. Andresen in February, 1971.\n\nAir data computers usually also have an input of total air temperature. This enables computation of static air temperature and true airspeed.\n\nFrom the late 1980s much of the USAF and USN aircraft fleets were retrofitted with the GEC Avionics Rochester developed Standard Centralised Air Data Computer (SCADC). Aircraft fitted included the A-4 Skyhawk, A-6 Intruder, A-7 Corsair, C-5A/B Galaxy, EA-6B Prowler, F-111 Aardvark, F-4 Phantom, S-3 Viking, C-141 Starlifter, C-135 Stratolifter, C-2 Greyhound, and E-2 Hawkeye , for which the company received the Queens Award for Technological Achievement. \n\nIn Airbus aircraft the air data computer is combined with altitude, heading and navigation sources in a single unit known as the Air Data Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU) this has now been replaced by the Global Navigation Air Data Inertial Reference System (GNADIRS).\n\nIn simpler aircraft including helicopters the Air Data Computers, generally two in number, and smaller, lighter and simpler than an ADIRU, may be called Air Data Units, although their internal computational power is still significant. They commonly have the pitot and static pressure inputs, as well as outside air temperature from a platinum resistance thermometer and may control heating of the pitot tube and static vent to prevent blockage due to ice. As on simpler aircraft there is usually not a fly by wire system, the outputs are typically to the cockpit altimeters or display system, flight data recorder and autopilot system. Output interfaces typically are ARINC 429, Gillham or even IEEE1394 (Firewire). The data provided may be true airspeed, pressure altitude, density altitude and Outside Air Temperature (OAT), but with no involvement in aircraft attitude or heading, as there are no gyroscopes or accelerometers fitted internally. These devices are usually autonomous and do not require pilot input, merely sending continuously updated data to the recipient systems while the aircraft is powered up. Some, like this ESCADU (Enhanced Software Configurble Air Data Unit) are software configurable to suit many different aircraft applications.\n\nApart from commercial ADCs implementation, there are available do-it-yourself, and Open implementations.\n\n\n"}

According to acts of the General Synod passed the previous year, if a parish does not accept the ministry of women priests it can formally request that none be appointed to minister to it. Likewise, if the local bishop has participated in the ordination of women as priests, a parish can request to be under the pastoral and sacramental care of another bishop who has not participated in such ordinations. In such a case the parish still remains in the diocese of the local diocesan bishop, at whose invitation the \"flying bishop\" makes his visitation.\n\nOn 4 December 2014, it was announced that the see of Maidstone would be filled again in order to provide a further provincial episcopal visitor for particular conservative evangelical members of the Church of England who take a complementarian view on headship.\n\nThe act empowers the metropolitans of the Church of England's two provinces to appoint provincial episcopal visitors as suffragan bishops whose main purpose is to be available for such visits to parishes across the province. Accordingly, four PEV bishops have been appointed across the two provinces.\n\nIn December 2010, the then-bishops of Richborough and Ebbsfleet resigned to join the Roman Catholic Church. On 5 May 2011, their successors as PEVs were announced.\n\nIn the Province of Canterbury:\n\n\nIn the Province of York:\n\n, the Bishop of Beverley ministered in 10 of the 12 dioceses in the northern province. The other two dioceses use different suffragan bishops: \n\nUntil the appointment of Paul Ferguson in 2014, the Bishop of Whitby provided AEO in York diocese; with Ferguson's appointment that oversight lapses to the Bishop of Beverley as PEV. Following the retirement of John Goddard, Bishop of Burnley, on 19 July 2014, it was announced that Philip North would be consecrated as the next Bishop of Burnley on 2 February 2015 and would have AEO in the dioceses of Blackburn and Carlisle; however, while North is now listed as the AEO bishop for Blackburn diocese, Webster is listed for Carlisle.\n\n, in the southern province, the bishops of Ebbsfleet and of Richborough together minister in 27 of the 30 dioceses. Of the three remaining dioceses, London and Southwark are ministered to by the Bishop of Fulham and Chichester by its diocesan bishop. The Bishop of Ebbsfleet serves the western 13 dioceses (Bath and Wells, Birmingham, Bristol, Coventry, Derby, Exeter, Gloucester, Hereford, Lichfield, Oxford, Salisbury, Truro and Worcester) while the Bishop of Richborough serves the eastern half (Canterbury, Chelmsford, Ely, Europe, Guildford, St Edmundsbury & Ipswich, Leicester, Lincoln, Norwich, Peterborough, Portsmouth, Rochester, St Albans and Winchester).\n\nAs of January 2018, 114 parishes have passed resolutions for conservative evangelical reasons; 53 of these have requested AEO from the Bishop of Maidstone. Rod Thomas is an assistant bishop in the Dioceses of Birmingham, Bristol, Carlisle, Chelmsford, Chester, Derby, Ely, London, Manchester, Norwich, Portsmouth, Rochester, Sheffield and Southwark.\n\nIn the Church in Wales, David Thomas was appointed to the comparable office of Provincial Assistant Bishop in 1996 when the province voted to ordain women to the priesthood. No successor was appointed when Thomas retired in 2008.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2097847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097847", "title": "Ba-ta-clan", "text": "Ba-ta-clan\n\nBa-ta-clan is a \"chinoiserie musicale\" (or operetta) in one act with music by Jacques Offenbach to an original French libretto by Ludovic Halévy. It was first performed at the Théâtre des Bouffes Parisiens, Paris, on 29 December 1855. The operetta uses set numbers and spoken dialogue and runs for under an hour.\n\n\"Ba-ta-clan\" was Offenbach's first big success, and opened his new winter theatre, the Salle Choiseul. The witty piece satirised everything from contemporary politics to grand opera conventions. \nIt was frequently revived in Paris, London and New York for decades, and Offenbach eventually expanded it as a full-length piece with a cast of eleven. Offenbach's early operettas were small-scale one-act works, since the law in France limited the licence for musical theatre works (other than most operas) to one-act pieces with no more than three singers and, perhaps, some mute characters. In 1858, this law was changed, and Offenbach was able to offer full-length works, beginning with \"Orpheus in the Underworld\".\n\nIn 1864, a music-hall called Bataclan opened in Paris, named after the operetta, and is still functioning today.\n\n\"Ba-ta-clan\" was first performed in England on 20 May 1857 at St James's Theatre during Offenbach's second visit to London, arranged by his father-in-law John Mitchell, when the composer brought the Bouffes company including orchestra and offered 19 different pieces, 11 by him. In 1867 the work was produced on a triple bill at St George's Opera House in London (as \"Ching-Chow-Hi\") alongside \"La Chatte métamorphosée en femme\" (as \"Puss in Petticoats\") and the premiere of Sullivan's \"The Contrabandista\".\n\nWhile the historical butt of the satire, Napoléon III, has passed, the situation mocked is timeless, the emperor Fé-ni-han being able to represent any great ruler on earth. Three years after the coup that replaced the Republic with the Empire and as France celebrated a victory in Crimea, the fake Chinese poke fun at the chauvinism of the time; in Second French Empire France, everything is under state surveillance, little different from the imaginary China depicted on stage. Kracauer summed up the target of the piece as; \"Power is a joke and court life mere mummery\".\n\nThe action takes place in Ché-i-no-or, in the gardens of the palace of the Emperor Fè-ni-han, with kiosks and pagodas. Ko-ko-ri-ko, chief of the guard is the head of a conspiracy to dethrone the Emperor; the opera opens with the conspirators setting the scene in Chinese. They leave, and the princess Fé-an-nich-ton reads a book - \"La Laitière de Montfermeil\" by Paul de Kock; she notices that Ké-ki-ka-ko is leafing through a copy of \"La Patrie\". They realize that each of them is not Chinese, but French. Ké-ki-ka-ko is the Viscount Alfred Cérisy, once shipwrecked on the coast of China and captured, tortured and brought to the palace and condemned to only repeat the rebels' song Ba-ta-clan. Fé-an-nich-ton confesses in song that she is Mademoiselle Virginie Durand, a light soprano who was on a Far East tour to initiate the locals into the great French repertoire: \"Les Huguenots\" and \"La Dame aux Camélias\", \"La Juive\" and \"Les Rendez-vous bourgeois\", \"Phèdre\" and \"Passé minuit\", when she was captured by the soldiers of Fé-ni-han. The two Parisians reflect wistfully of home, and Fé-an-nich-ton sings the 'Ronde de Florette'. They both decide to run away, dancing as they go.\n\nThe conspirators return, but when alone, Fè-ni-han laments on his lot; he is actually Anastase Nourrisson, a native of Brive-la-Gaillarde and his only wish is to see France again. Ko-ko-ri-ko comes back threateningly and he and Fè-ni-han sing a duo in made-up Italian in the style of Bellini. In fact Fé-an-nich-ton and Ké-ki-ka-ko have been caught by Ko-ko-ri-ko while trying to flee, and the emperor has been asked for the death penalty, which he cannot refuse.\n\nIn their distress, Virginia and Alfred sing one last time La Ronde de Florette, and Fè-ni-han is amazed to hear them speaking French, likewise Fé-an-nich-ton and Ké-ki-ka-ko are surprised to hear the Emperor talking their language. Fè-ni-han dismisses the conspirators and explains how eight years previously he was dragged in front of the real prince Fè-ni-han and told that the only way he would avoid execution was by assuming the habits and role of emperor. He now makes the same offer to Ké-ki-ka-ko who naturally refuses, and asks why an insurrection is being plotted. Fè-ni-han, it seems, through not speaking Chinese had accidentally impaled the five most virtuous people in the land, and now faces a conspiracy against his rule. Ké-ki-ka-ko threatens to join the conspiracy so both summon the conspirators with the Ba-ta-clan anthem (mixed with the Chorale 'Ein feste Burg' from \"Les Huguenots\").\nFinally, Fè-ni-han is handed a letter from the chief conspirator on a silver platter, revealing that he, Ko-ko-ri-ko, is also of French origin (born rue Mouffetard) and he is ready to provide the means for their escape in return for being allowed himself to become Emperor. All ends happily with a reprise of the Ba-ta-clan anthem, and Fé-an-nich-ton, Ké-ki-ka-ko and Fé-ni-han prepare to depart for France.\n\nJacques Offenbach: \"Ba-Ta-Clan\", Orchestre Jean-François Paillard, Choir Philippe Caillard\n\nJacques Offenbach: \"Ba-Ta-Clan\", L'Ensemble de Basse-Normandie\n\n\n"}

He was also a retired major general of the Mississippi National Guard who served during World War II.\n\nBorn in Meridian, Mississippi to Emily Jones and Gillespie Montgomery, Montgomery graduated from McCallie School and Mississippi State University in Starkville in 1943. While in college, Montgomery joined the Beta Tau chapter of Kappa Alpha Order.\n\nA 1943 Reserve Officers' Training Corps graduate, Gillespie was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army. He served with the 12th Armored Division in Europe during World War II. He served on active duty again during Korean War, this time as a member of the 31st Infantry Division. Montgomery was a member of the Mississippi Army National Guard until 1980, and retired as a major general. For his military service, Montgomery received the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star Medal with \"V\" for Valor device, Army Commendation Medal and Combat Infantryman Badge.\n\nBefore running for Congress, he owned his own insurance company, the Montgomery Insurance Agency. In addition, he served as vice president of the Greater Mississippi Life Insurance Company of Meridian, Mississippi.\n\n\nMontgomery represented part of Meridian in the Mississippi State Senate between 1956 and 1966. He was elected to Congress from what was then the 4th District in 1966. Prentiss Walker, the first Republican elected to either house of Congress from Mississippi since Reconstruction, had given up the seat after one term to run for the United States Senate against James O. Eastland. \n\nMontgomery defeated Lewis McAllister, also of Meridian, who had been the first Republican elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives since Reconstruction. Walker ran again for the seat in 1968 but lost to Montgomery, who received 70 percent of the vote. The latter was re-elected a total of fourteen times from the majority-white district, serving for thirty years until 1997. His district was renumbered as the 3rd District after the 1970 census, when Mississippi lost a district in redistricting\n\nMontgomery was one of the more conservative Democrats in the House. Most notably, he was known for being somewhat more \"hawkish\" than other members of his party. He was very popular in his district, usually winning reelection by some of the highest margins in the country. Although the district's voters were increasingly willing to vote Republican at the national level (it has only supported the official Democratic candidate for president once since 1956), at the local level Montgomery usually faced \"sacrificial lamb\" opponents on the few occasions he faced any Republican opposition at all. Montgomery ran unopposed from 1970 to 1974, in 1980, and from 1984 to 1990. In four elections—1972, 1980, 1984 and 1988—Montgomery ran unopposed even as the Republican presidential candidate carried the district in a landslide. Observers assumed that Montgomery would be succeeded by a Republican after he retired, given the crossover of conservative white voters from the Democratic Party to the GOP in the second half of the 20th century. As it turned out, when Montgomery retired in 1996, the district was taken by Republican Chip Pickering in a landslide. The Democrats have only put up a candidate in the district four times since then, and have only won more than 35 percent of the vote once.\n\nHe was the author of the G.I. Bill of Rights that gives members of the service money to pay for college and was a lead sponsor in establishing the Veterans Affairs cabinet-level position. Montgomery gave a speech on the House floor in April 1975 in which he spoke against foreign aid to South Vietnam and said, \"The South Vietnamese can blame only themselves for their present situation.\"\n\nMontgomery's greatest legislative victory was the enactment of the bill that bears his name: the Montgomery GI Bill . In 1981, he came to the forefront to lead the fight for passage of a new G.I. Bill. As a World War Il veteran, he believed that the country should provide educational benefits to its service members and that the combination of military service and a college degree would make these individuals valuable assets to the country. He also wanted to reverse the Department of Defense's declining recruitment efforts, which had dropped sharply in the 1980s, and improve the overall quality of the volunteers. Nearly half of those recruited during that time lacked high-school diplomas and the basic skills needed in a modern military. Congressman Montgomery saw that educational shortfall as a direct threat to America's military readiness and national security.\n\nAs Veterans' Affairs Committee chairman, Montgomery led opposition to the Kerry-Daschle bill (Agent Orange Disabilities Act of 1987, S.1787) that would have required the VA to begin compensating veterans who contracted non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and lung cancer a presumed service-connected disease. Montgomery asserted that \"further studies were needed to prove a connection between various diseases and Agent Orange before the government should be held liable for disability benefits\" despite several such JAMA published studies by the National Cancer Institute and the VA and one by the New Jersey Agent Orange Commission. Subsequent scientific studies made connections between Agent Orange and Vietnam Veterans illnesses and the increased birth defects of their children. In 1991 Montgomery stood behind president George H.W. Bush at the signing of the Agent Orange Act. He had opposed a similar bill the previous year. After years of opposing Vietnam Veterans receiving disability for exposure to Agent Orange, he now appeared as their champion. In the same year he authored the Montgomery Amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987, which effectively transferred control of the National Guard away from the states and to the Department of Defense by prohibiting state governors from withholding National Guard forces.\n\nOn September 13, 1988, Montgomery became the first congressman to lead the U.S. House in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance as a permanent part of its daily and morning business operations. The day prior to his death, Congressman Gene Taylor introduced an amendment to a House Defense Appropriations Bill to rename the bill the Sonny Montgomery National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007. Following his death, James F. Webb Funeral Home in Meridian, Mississippi performed the funeral services. President George W. Bush ordered U.S. flags to be flown at half staff. In addition, the U.S. House of Representatives canceled non-suspension votes on the day of his funeral. Montgomery was buried in Magnolia Cemetery in Meridian, Mississippi.\n\nHe was a delegate to Democratic National Convention from Mississippi in 1996. On November 10, 2005, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest American civilian honor, by President George W. Bush. Montgomery had played paddleball with Bush's father, George H. W. Bush.\n\nA number of public projects have been named in his honor, including:\n\n\n Retrieved on 2009-5-13\n"}

In 1998, Shawn Fernandes was in the Boomtang Boys video for their song \"Squeezetoy\" as a dancer. He had a few recordings in English and Portuguese under his real name Shawn Fernandes before adopting the name Desman. According to his own account, he adopted the name Desman because in his youth his friends referred to him as \"Dez, man\" – thus creating his artistic pseudonym Desman.\n\nHis self-titled breakthrough album in 2002 featured three top ten singles (\"Shook\", \"Spread My Wings\" and \"Get Ready\") on the Canadian charts. The album went on to achieve gold certification in Canada. The single, \"Spread My Wings\", is a cover of the unreleased male group, Vega, featuring Chilli of TLC. His follow-up album, Back for More garnered a Juno Award for Best R&B Recording which featured the number one hit single \"Let's Go\". His album \"Fresh\" garnered two gold singles, one platinum single, Video of the Year at the Much Music Video Awards, Canadian Dance/Pop Song of the year at the Stylus Awards, as well as SOCAN Number 1 Award for Electric/Night Like This.\n\nShawn Desman is also a producer and has worked with various artists producing hit singles for Nick Carter, Kreesha Turner, Keshia Chante, Danny Fernandes, as well as contestants on YTV's The Next Star where he produced the song (One More First Chance) for Brock Zanrosso in 2009 and \"It Might Be You\" for contestant Parker Schmidt in 2011.\n\nIn 2013, Shawn Desman released his fourth studio album, \"Alive\", along with an accompanying short film of the same name. The album spawned two hit singles; \"Nobody Does It Like You\" and \"Dum Da Dum\".

{"id": "2097879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097879", "title": "Kinda (Doctor Who)", "text": "Kinda (Doctor Who)\n\nKinda is the third serial of the 19th season of the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\", which was first broadcast in four twice-weekly parts on BBC1 from 1 to 9 February 1982.\n\nIn the serial, the Mara, an alien being from another plane uses the dreams of the time-travelling air stewardess Tegan Jovanka (Janet Fielding) to reach the planet Deva Loka. The Mara takes over the body of the Kinda Aris (Adrian Mills) to attack colonists on the planet.\n\nAn Earth colonisation survey expedition to the beautiful jungle planet Deva Loka is being depleted as members of the survey disappear one by one. Four have gone, leaving the remainder somewhat apprehensive. Sanders relies on bombast and rules, while Hindle his deputy, is close to breaking point. Only Todd, the scientific officer, seems to deal with the situation with equanimity. She does not see the native people, the Kinda, as a threat but rather respects their culture and is intrigued by their power of telepathy. The social structure is also curious in that women seem dominant and are the only ones with the power of voice. The humans are holding two silent males hostage for \"observation\". Todd believes they are more advanced than they first appear, as they possess necklaces representative of the double helix of DNA, indicating a more advanced civilisation.\n\nElsewhere in the jungle, the TARDIS crew are also under stress, especially Nyssa, who has collapsed from exhaustion. The Fifth Doctor constructs a delta wave augmenter to enable her to rest in the TARDIS, while he and Adric venture deeper into the jungle. They soon find an automated total survival suit (TSS) system, which activates and marches them to the Dome, the colonist base. Sanders is a welcoming but gruff presence, further undermining Hindle at regular intervals. Sanders decides to venture into the jungle in the TSS, leaving the highly-strung Hindle in charge. His will is enforced by means of the two Kinda hostages, who have forged a telepathic link with him, believing their souls to have been captured in his mirror. The Doctor, Todd and Adric are arrested as Hindle now evinces megalomania.\n\nTegan faces a more metaphysical crisis. She has fallen asleep near the euphonious and soporific windchimes, unaware of the danger of the dreaming of an unshared mind (one not engaged in telepathy with another humanoid). Her mind opens in a void, where she undergoes provocation and terror from a series of nightmarish characters, one of which taunts her: \"You will agree to being me, sooner or later, this side of madness or the other\". The spectres are a manifestation of the Mara, an evil being of the subconscious that longs for corporeal reality. Mentally tortured, she eventually agrees to become the Mara and a snake symbol passes to her arm. When her mind returns to her body, she is possessed by the Mara. She passes the snake symbol to the first Kinda she finds, a young man named Aris, who is the brother of one of the Kinda in the Dome. He too is transformed by evil and now finds the power of voice.\n\nBack at the Dome, Hindle has conceived a bizarre and immolatory plan to destroy the jungle, which he views as a threat. Adric plays along with this delusion but Hindle’s world starts to fall apart when, first, Adric \"betrays\" him and then Sanders defies expectation and returns from the jungle. Sanders is radically different from the martinet in earlier episodes. Panna, an aged female mystic of the tribe, presented him with a strange wooden box called the \"Box of Jhana\" which, when opened, cleared his mind and left him a more contented and enlightened person. When Hindle continues to claim authority over the Dome, Sanders plays along with his deputy's megalomania - \"As you like. You know best.\" He still has the box and shows it to Hindle, who makes the Doctor open it.\n\nThe Doctor and Todd see beyond the toy inside and share a vision from Panna and her young ward, Karuna, who invites them to a cave. The shock of the situation (accompanied by strange phenomena) allow the Doctor and Todd to slip away into the jungle, where they encounter Aris dominating a group of Kinda and seemingly fulfilling a tribal prophecy that \"When the Not-We come, one will arise from among We, a male with Voice who must be obeyed.\" Karuna soon finds the Doctor and Todd and takes them to meet Panna in the cave from the vision, with the wise woman realising the danger of the situation now Aris has voice. She places them in a trance like state and reveals that the Mara has gained dominion on Deva Loka. The Great Wheel, which turns as civilisations rise and fall has turned again and the hour is near when chaos will reign, instigated by the Mara. The vision she shares is Panna’s last act: when it is finished, she is dead.\n\nIn the Kinda world, multiple fathers are shared by children, just as multiple memories are held and at Panna's death, her life experience transfers to Karuna. She urges Todd and the Doctor to return to the Dome, to prevent Aris leading an attack on it, which will increase the chaos and hasten the collapse of Kinda civilisation.\n\nAt the Dome, Hindle, Sanders and Adric remain in a state of unreality, with the former becoming ever more demented, unbalanced, and infantile. Sanders continues to humour him, even to the point of talking Adric out of an initial escape attempt. Adric does eventually escape, however, and attempts to pilot the TSS but is soon confronted by Aris and the Kinda. He panics and Aris is wounded by the machine (which responds to the mental impulses of the operator) and the Kinda scatter.\n\nThe Doctor and Todd find an emotionally wrecked and sleeping Tegan near the windchimes and conclude that she was the path of the Mara back into this world. They find Adric and the party heads back to the Dome, where Hindle has now completed the laying of explosives, which will incinerate the jungle and the Dome, the ultimate self-defence. Hindle is tricked into opening the Box of Jhana and the visions therein restore his mental balance as with Sanders. The two enslaved Kinda are freed when the mirror entrapping them is shattered. The Doctor then devises the only method of combating the Mara; since evil cannot face itself, he organises the construction of a large circle of mirrors (actually reflective solar panels) in a jungle clearing. Aris is trapped within it and the snake on his arm breaks free, whereupon he is pulled from the circle. The Mara swells to giant proportions but is then banished back from the corporeal world to the Dark Places of the Inside.\n\nWith the threat of the Mara dissipated and the personnel of the Dome back to more balanced selves, the Doctor, Adric and an exhausted Tegan decide to leave (as does Todd, who decides 'it's all a bit green'). When they reach the TARDIS, Nyssa greets them, fully recovered.\n\nThe working title for this story was \"The Kinda\". This was the first story Eric Saward oversaw as script editor, though \"Castrovalva\" was broadcast earlier.\n\nNyssa makes only brief appearances at the start of episode 1, and at the end of 4, because the script had largely been developed at a time when only two companions for the Doctor were envisioned. When it was known a third companion would also be present, rather than write Nyssa into the entire storyline it was decided she would remain in the TARDIS throughout and be absent through most of the narrative. To account for this absence, Nyssa was scripted to collapse at the end of the previous story, \"Four to Doomsday\". In this story, she remains in the TARDIS, resting. Sarah Sutton's contract was amended to account for this two-episode absence.\n\nThis serial was examined closely in the 1983 media studies volume \"Doctor Who: The Unfolding Text\" by John Tulloch and Manuel Alvarado. This was the first major scholarly work dedicated to \"Doctor Who\". Tulloch and Alvarado compare Kinda with Ursula K. Le Guin's 1976 novel \"The Word for World Is Forest\", which shares several themes with \"Kinda\" and may have been a template for its story. \"The Unfolding Text\" also examines the way \"Kinda\" incorporates Buddhist and Christian symbols and themes, as well as elements from the writings of Carl Jung.\n\nThe story was repeated on BBC1 across four consecutive evenings from 22–25 August 1983, achieving viewing figures of 4.2, 4.3, 3.9 and 5.0 million viewers respectively.\n\nPaul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping gave the serial a positive review in \"The Discontinuity Guide\" (1995), writing, \"One of the best \"Doctor Who\" stories ever, astonishingly directed and written as a theatrical piece brimming with allusions and parallels. It's also got a direct and unsilly performance from Simon Rouse, and a thoughtful one from Nerys Hughes.\" In \"The Television Companion\" (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker praised the dream sequences, the \"intelligence and sophistication\" of the script and direction, as well as the main cast. They felt that these outweighed the more negative aspects, such as a plot that could be hard to follow and the unconvincing alien environment and snake. In 2012, Patrick Mulkern of \"Radio Times\" called \"Kinda\" \"an imperfect gem\", with some production shortcomings in an otherwise worthwhile story. He praised the guest cast and the \"unusually adult psychodrama\". \"The A.V. Club\" reviewer Christopher Bahn said that the strength of the serial was \"the way it behaves like an experimental stage-theater piece\", with the highlight being Tegan's dream sequences. However, he felt that a problem was that the TARDIS crew was \"kind of sidelined ... and rather passive\", with the Doctor merely reacting to events. DVD Talk's Justin Felix gave \"Kinda\" three and a half out of five stars, describing it as fun and interesting, though with its fair share of poor special effects. Ian Berriman of \"SFX\" gave the serial a positive review, highlighting its adult tone and the strong female roles.\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in December 1983.\n\nIn 1997, the novel was also issued by BBC Audio as an audio book, read by Peter Davison.\n\n\"Kinda\" was released on VHS in October 1994 with a cover illustration by Colin Howard. This story was released on DVD on 7 March 2011, along with the sequel \"Snakedance\" in a special-edition box-set entitled \"Mara Tales\". For this DVD release there is an option for the effect of the Mara at the end of part 4 to be replaced with a CGI version. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 93 on 25 July 2012 (minus any special features). In January 2019, Kinda was again released in Blu Ray format as part of the Peter Davison (Season 19 or Season 1) Blu Ray release.\n\n"}

Due to their dynamic role within the extracellular matrix they are considered matricellular proteins. The first member of the family, thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), was discovered in 1971 by Nancy L. Baenziger.\n\nThe thrombospondins are a family of multifunctional proteins. The family consists of thrombospondins 1-5 and can be divided into 2 subgroups: A, which contains TSP-1 and -2, and B, which contains TSP-3, -4 and -5 (also designated cartilage oligomeric protein or COMP). TSP-1 and -2 are homotrimers, consisting of three identical subunits, whereas TSP-3, -4 and -5 are homopentamers.\n\nTSP-1 and TSP-2 are produced by immature astrocytes during brain development, which promotes the development of new synapses.\n\nThrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) is encoded by THBS1. It was first isolated from platelets that had been stimulated with thrombin, and so was designated 'thrombin-sensitive protein'. Since its first recognition, functions for TSP-1 have been found in multiple biological processes including angiogenesis, apoptosis, activation of TGF-beta and Immune regulation. As such, TSP-1 is designated a multifunctional protein.\n\nTSP-1 has multiple receptors, among which CD36, CD47 and integrins are of particular note.\n\nTSP-1 is antiangiogenic, inhibiting the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells by interactions with CD36 expressed on their surface of these cells. Inhibitory peptides and fragments of TSP1 bind to CD36, leading to the expression of FAS ligand (FasL), which activates its specific, ubiquitous receptor, Fas. This leads to the activation of caspases and apoptosis of the cell. Since tumors overexpressing TSP-1 typically grow slower, exhibit less angiogenesis, and have fewer metastases, TSP1 is an attractive target for cancer treatment. Because TSP1 is extremely large (~120 kDa monomer), not very abundant and exerts multiple actions, its clinical usefulness is questionable. However, small-molecules based on a CD36-binding peptide sequence from TSP1 are being tested. One analog, ABT-510, exhibits potent proapoptotic activity in cultured cells, while clinically it is very well tolerated with therapeutic benefits reported against several malignancies. In 2005, ABT-510 was evaluated in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of several types of cancer. \n\nADAMTS1; ADAMTS10; ADAMTS12; ADAMTS13; ADAMTS14; ADAMTS15; ADAMTS16; ADAMTS17;\nADAMTS18; ADAMTS19; ADAMTS2; ADAMTS20; ADAMTS3; ADAMTS4; ADAMTS5; ADAMTS6;\nADAMTS7; ADAMTS8; ADAMTS9; ADAMTSL1; ADAMTSL2; ADAMTSL3; ADAMTSL4; ADAMTSL5;\nBAI1; BAI2; BAI3; C6; C7; C8A; C8B; C9;\nC9orf8; C9orf94; CFP; CILP; CILP2; CTGF; CYR61; HMCN1;\nLIBC; NOV; PAPLN; RSPO1; RSPO3; SEMA5A; SEMA5B; SPON1;\nSPON2; SSPO; THBS1; THBS2; THSD1; THSD3; THSD7A; THSD7B;\nUNC5A; UNC5B; UNC5C; UNC5D; WISP1; WISP2; WISP3;\n\n"}

The Greek island of Kos lies along the entry into the Gulf.\n\nBodrum, located in its northwest reaches, is the only large city on the gulf today. In ancient times, alongside Halicarnassus (modern-day \"Bodrum\"), the city of Ceramus, located midway along the gulf's northern shore and after which the gulf was named, was also an important urban center. Across Ceramus (\"Gereme\") (in the modern township of ), at a short distance from the gulf's southern shore and not far from its outlying waters, was another historical site of note, called \"Cedrae\" in ancient times. Cedrae was located in Sedir Island, which was prized by visitors for its beach and of which some remains still exist.\n\nThe alluvial plain, also named Gökova, which extends to the Gulf's end, is the location of the townships of Akyaka and Gökova, with only a few kilometers separating the two. These settlements saw their populations considerably increase in recent years, with Akyaka, especially, becoming a rising center of tourism. The municipalities of both of these townships were recently created. They depend upon the town of Ula, which is accessed through Sakar Pass at an altitude of 670 meters and offers an impressive view of the Gulf. Until 1945, the hamlets across the plain, mostly marshlands ridden with malaria until that time, were collectively known as \"Gökabad\". Consequently, the gulf and one of the settlements came to be called \"Gökova\", a term which is often used to designate the area in which Akyaka, and not the neighboring township of Gökova, is actually prominent.\n\nIn sum, the name, \"Gökova\", (possibly derived from \"Cova\", the designation by which the area was known in Ottoman times) is mentioned as \"Djova\" in some recent English navigation charts and alternately is used for the gulf, for the plain at the end of the same gulf, for a township situated in the same plain, and as a casual term covering the emerging resort area centered in the coastal town of Akyaka. The Carian city of Idyma, with acropolis and famed rock tombs, is found at Kozlukuyu, Gökova town, inland from Akyaka. In ancient times, Akyaka was simply a suburb of Kozlukuyu.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2097958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097958", "title": "Bellanca Cruisair", "text": "Bellanca Cruisair\n\nThe Bellanca 14-7 Cruisair and its successors were a family of single-engined light aircraft manufactured in the United States from the mid-1930s onwards.\n\nBellanca established itself in the market for 6-8 seat aircraft, but believed that it could also successfully sell smaller 3-4 seat aircraft. To fill this niche Bellanca designed The '14-7 Cruisair' as a modern, low-wing cantilever monoplane with a fuselage intended to contribute lift to the design. Although the prototype flew with fixed tailwheel undercarriage, the 14-9 production version was the first US light aircraft to be mass-produced with retractable undercarriage, the main wheels rotating aft into wheel-wells in the wings, with approximately 50 produced before production was interrupted by World War II.\n\nAfter WWII Bellanca resumed production with the up-dated Bellanca 14-13 Cruisair Senior, retaining the Bellanca 14-7's basic design, featuring an enlarged cabin, a horizontally opposed Franklin 6A4-335-B3 engine in place of the earlier models' Le Blond radial and an oval vertical endplate on each horizontal stabiliser. This latter feature gained the type the affectionate nickname \"Cardboard Constellation\", because the arrangement is similar to the contemporary Lockheed Constellation airliner.\n\nThe naming convention for Bellanca aircraft was followed with the Cruisair series, with the first number giving the wing area in square feet, (dropping the final digit), while the second number is the aircraft's horsepower, (again dropping the final digit).\n\nConstruction of the series is fairly conventional with wings constructed of spruce with plywood skin and fuselages built up from a welded steel-tube framework with a fabric covering.\nA constant process of refinement led to many variants, sometimes given new names but retaining the same structure differing only in powerplant, minor details and furnishings. The only major variations were the introduction of a single swept fin and tri-cycle retractable undercarriage. Production was carried out at a variety of companies, including Bellanca, Downer, Aviabellanca, Northern Aircraft and Inter-Air, with little variation other than powerplant and furnishings.\n\nThe highly responsive flying characteristics of the aircraft are evident to anyone who has flown one. Bill Cox, the well known aviation journalist at \"Plane and Pilot Magazine\" commented regarding the flying qualities of Vikings that they \"have long been famous for control response and harmony that seems almost psychic in nature\" , and asserted, \"Owners almost unanimously pronounce the Viking the best handling airplane they've ever flown.\"\n\nPre-war development culminated in the 1941 14-12, at which point production ceased to allow Bellanca to work as a military subcontractor for the duration of the war when an attempt to market a militarized version as a trainer was unsuccessful. After the war, Bellanca returned to the design to create the Bellanca 14-13 and its successors.\n\nThe 14-13 was introduced in 1946; in its improved 14-13-3 version the aircraft remained in production until 1956.\n\nA higher performance design revision was granted FAA approval as the 14-19 Cruisemaster on September 26, 1949. The new model featured structural upgrades, a Lycoming O435-A engine, an increased gross weight of 2,600 lbs, hydraulically operated landing gear and flaps, and a deluxe interior. 99 of these airplanes were produced between 1949 and 1951. Externally, a near-look-alike to the earlier models, this version was distinguished by its larger, oval-shaped endplates. All production ceased in 1956 as Bellanca wound up its operations.\nThe 14-19 design was revived by Northern Aircraft and granted FAA approval on January 7, 1957 as the 14-19-2 Cruisemaster. The new model featured a Continental O-470K engine, an increased gross weight of 2,700 pounds, an updated instrument panel as well as new paint and upholstery schemes. 104 of these airplanes were produced between 1957 and 1958 \n\nThe company was renamed Downer Aircraft in 1959. Inter-Air acquired the production rights in 1962 and was renamed as the Bellanca Sales Company, a subsidiary of Miller Flying Service. Further development of the design by Inter-Air resulted in the modernized Viking series introduced in 1962.\n\nThe Bellanca Viking and Super Viking were developed through modifications of the 'Cruisair' designs by the aviation pioneer Giuseppe Bellanca. Derived directly from the Cruisair, the Viking introduced a swept single tail of similar area, replacing the triple-tail of earlier aircraft, initially manufactured by Downer Aircraft as the Model 260 starting around 1958. The Viking model was born out of discussions at Downer for a bigger version of the \"Model 260\" with at least 300 horsepower. The Minnesota based company employed skilled craftsman who manufactured the wing from spruce and the new 300 hp model was named the \"Viking\" in respect to the many Scandinavians of the area.\n\nThe first Model 17 Viking appeared in 1967 called the \"17-30\" it was powered by a 300 hp Continental IO-520-K. In 1969 a Viking powered by a 290 hp (later 300 hp) Lycoming IO-540 was introduced, either normally aspirated (17-31) or turbocharged (17-31TC).\nOver the years there were a number of refinements in the aircraft. The original hydraulic gear and flap actuation system was redesigned in 1968 introducing electric flaps. In 1969 the FAA issued Type Certificate A18CE and the aircraft built under that design were designated the \"A\" series \"Super Vikings\". Aside from refinements already made to late Viking 300 models, the new 300A Vikings (17-30A, 17-31A and 17-31ATC) had a gross weight increase to 3,325 lbs. The original complex fuel system with five tanks and two fuel selectors allowing eight possible combinations of selector settings was simplified to a left, right and auxiliary system in 1974. In 1979 the Continental powered Vikings sported a fully enclosed nosewheel thanks to a redesign of the engine mount. This necessitated the use of cowl flaps for the first time on the Viking but resulted in a 12 mph increase. In 1979 production of the Lycoming powered 17-31A ceased. In 1996, the Continental IO-550 was made available as an option.\n\nDesigned and produced in the post-World War II era, the Bellanca 14-13 Cruisair Senior was aimed at a general aviation market. Pilot/owners were offered a combination of performance, low engine power and a modest price of $4500. Its performance and structural strength also made it attractive for utility work, but in many ways the Bellanca design was an anachronism, relying on a conventional landing gear configuration and wood and fabric construction that harkened back to an earlier age. Postwar economics along with a glut of surplus military aircraft precluded heavy sales although about 600 were produced.\n\nDespite its introduction into a period where private aircraft sales were stagnant, the aircraft remained popular through all of its incarnations and today is considered a classic cabin monoplane and is much in demand.\n\nSince 2002 the company has been operated by a group of six Bellanca enthusiasts who bought the company from the state of Minnesota and established Alexandria Aircraft Co. LLC, providing technical support and parts for owners and maintenance organisations in the field. New aircraft have been available from Alexandria Aircraft Co., who have sold one new aircraft manufactured in 2005.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A new version later appeared in \"Titans Secret Files\" #2 (October 2000).\n\nMartha Roberts was the daughter of Professor Roberts, who tutored his young protégé Darrel Dane in his home laboratory. During the summer of 1939, Martha was being blackmailed by a criminal named Falco over love letters she had written one of her former college teachers. After imbibing a concoction, Dane found himself shrunk to the height of six inches, but with his normal strength intact. Martha sewed him new clothes to wear, and he began to worry that he might never be able to regain his normal height.\n\nAfter refusing to pay Falco any more blackmail money, Martha was kidnapped by Falco and rescued by the \"doll man\". Finding that through intense concentration Dane could affect his height, he decided to begin to fight crime as the Doll Man, often assisted by Martha (who also became his scientific research assistant).\n\nSeveral years later, while wishing and concentrating about being able to shrink down to aid Doll Man, Darrel also was thinking about the same thing and suddenly, Martha's height and weight dwindled down until she was on the same scale as Doll Man. She began to team with Doll Man as Midge, the Doll Girl. She fights \"the Skull, the Druids, the Count de Grasso, and the houngan Dr. Voodoo.\n\nAfter Quality Comics went out of business in 1956, DC Comics acquired their superhero characters. Doll Man and several other former Quality properties were re-launched in \"Justice League of America\" #107 (October 1973) as the Freedom Fighters. As was done with many other characters DC had acquired from other publishers or that were holdovers from Golden Age titles, the Freedom Fighters were located on a parallel world, one called \"Earth-X\" where Nazi Germany had won World War II. The team were featured in their own series for fifteen issues (1976–1978), in which the team temporarily leaves Earth-X for Earth-One (where most DC titles were set). It was revealed during the \"Freedom Fighters\" series that Martha Roberts was now deceased on Earth-X, and Doll Man later encountered the Earth-One version of Roberts. The Earth-One Martha Roberts became a supporting character in the series and also guest-starred in \"Teen Titans\" #47 as a reporter.\n\nFollowing the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", a story that was intended to eliminate the similarly confusing histories that DC had attached to its characters by retroactively merging the various parallel worlds into one, Doll Girl's Earth-X and Earth-One days were erased and her histories were merged as one.\n\nIn \"Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters\" #4 (February 2008), it is revealed that Martha is deceased, killed by cancer. She was unable to get medical treatment because of her small size.\n\nA version of Doll Man and Doll Girl about whom little has been revealed briefly appeared in \"Titans Secret Files\" #2. This Doll Girl also had a cameo in \"Wonder Woman\" (vol. 2) #174.\n\nAs Doll Girl, Martha Roberts could shrink through mental concentration to a height of 5 and 1/2 inches. She retained her normal strength and was a fair hand-to-hand combatant. She could pilot the small \"flying saucer\" that the duo used and was able to use other small vehicles as needed.\n\nIn \"Kingdom Come\", the Doll Man/Doll Girl franchise is represented by a female character named Living Doll, wearing the Doll Girl costume, and is seen sitting on Superman's shoulder acting as a sort of secretary for the Justice League. She is the daughter of the original Doll Man and Doll Girl.\n\nBased on comments by Grant Morrison, this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-X.\n\n"}
{"id": "2097970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097970", "title": "Appointment of Church of England bishops", "text": "Appointment of Church of England bishops\n\nThe appointment of Church of England diocesan bishops follows a somewhat convoluted process, reflecting the church's traditional tendency towards compromise and \"ad hoc\" solutions, traditional ambiguity between hierarchy and democracy, and traditional role as a semi-autonomous state church. (Suffragan bishops are appointed through a much simpler process, reflecting their status as directly responsible to their diocesan bishop.)\n\nSince 1976, when a diocesan bishop (including those of the 42 English dioceses and the Bishop of Sodor and Man but not the Bishop in Europe) dies, retires or moves on and leaves a diocesan bishopric vacant, the process of replacing them involves several stages. The first of these involves the diocesan Vacancy-in-See Committee, composed of:\n\n\nThe committee produces a “Statement of Needs” assessing the needs of the diocese. It then sends this statement to the Crown Nominations Commission (known until 2003 as the Crown Appointments Commission), which consists of:\n\n\nBeyond these fourteen voting members, the Prime Minister's appointments secretary and the Archbishops' appointments secretary meet with the commission and help supply it with information on possible candidates. Normally the archbishop in whose province the vacancy lies chairs the commission.\n\nWhen meeting to nominate an archbishop, the commission is chaired by a fifteenth voting member, who must be an \"actual communicant lay member of the Church of England\". He or she is appointed by the prime minister (if an Archbishop of Canterbury is being appointed) or by the Church of England Appointments Committee (if an Archbishop of York).\n\nThe commission meets several times in secret. The commission then forwards two names to the prime minister, who chooses one of them, or (exceptionally) requests additional names from the commission. In recent memory, the only prime minister who has not accepted the commission's preferred candidate was Margaret Thatcher, who opposed Jim Thompson’s nomination as Bishop of Birmingham, due to his (perceived) liberal and left-leaning views. Since 2007 the convention has been that the prime minister will choose the first-named recommendation. If the chosen individual accepts the office, the prime minister advises the Sovereign, who then formally nominates the prime minister's choice. Thereafter, the diocese's College of Canons meets to 'elect' the new bishop. (This stage of the process was mocked by Ralph Waldo Emerson thus: \"The King sends the Dean and Canons a congé d'élire, or leave to elect, but also sends them the name of the person whom they are to elect. They go into the Cathedral, chant and pray; and after these invocations invariably find that the dictates of the Holy Ghost agree with the recommendation of the King\" [Emerson, English Traits, XIII, 1856].)\n\nFollowing the election, the new bishop must be confirmed in office. A provincial ceremony takes place where the bishop-elect swears an oath. During the ceremony, the appropriate archbishop confers the \"spiritualities\" of the see on the bishop-elect, who then takes office. At a later point, the monarch confers the \"temporalities\" of the see, which formerly included vast church estates and the bishop's residence, but which have now become more limited. If the bishop has never previously received consecration as a bishop, he must be consecrated; both the confirmation of election and episcopal consecration (if any) generally take place to suit the archbishop's convenience and always on a Principal Feast or Festival of the Church year. Episcopal consecrations normally happen in York Minster for a bishop of the northern province, or, for a bishop of the southern province, in Canterbury Cathedral or one of the great churches or cathedrals in London (such as St Paul's or Southwark Cathedral), or Westminster Abbey.\n\nFinally, a symbolic ceremony of installation or enthronement takes place in the bishop's new cathedral, during which he is welcomed by his new diocese and first sits in his cathedra.\n\nIn July 2007, shortly after taking office as Prime Minister, Gordon Brown released a green paper outlining several proposed reforms of the Prime Minister's ability to exercise traditional Royal Prerogative powers. Among these were several which could affect Church of England appointments, including those of diocesan bishops. The proposed scheme would see (in future) a single name emerge from the Crown Nominations Commission, rather than two, which the Prime Minister would simply pass along to the Queen. Furthermore, the role of the Prime Minister's appointments secretary would be reduced or even eliminated. It was agreed that from 2007 the first-named candidate would be selected by the prime minister, unless a change in circumstances meant that candidate could no longer accept the post.\n\n\n"}

The academic programs of Khulna University started on 31 August 1991 with 80 students in four disciplines. As of November 2019, the university has 29 disciplines under six schools and two institutes. It is the only public university in Bangladesh where student politics is not allowed.\n\nIn 1974, the Kudrat-e-Khuda Commission stated the importance of establishing a public university in Khulna Division in its final report. The government finalized the programme of establishing a university at Khulna on 4 January 1987 and the Khulna University Act was passed in the Bangladesh National Parliament in July 1990. Distinctive law named খুলনা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় আইন (The Khulna University Act, 1990) passed in the parliament empowers the university. The university started its formal inauguration of academic activities on 25 November 1991.\n\nThe academic program of the university commenced in August 1991 with four disciplines: Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), Architecture, Business Administration (BA), and Urban and Rural Planning (URP).\n\nIn the following year, Forestry and Wood Technology (FWT) and Fisheries and Marine Resources Technology (FMRT) disciplines started up.

ROUTER arranges seminar, project fair, and publishes ICT based magazines. ROUTER is the club of the students of Electronics & Communication Engineering Discipline of Khulna University. Which elaborates as \"Roaming Over the Universe Through Electronic Roadway.\" The theme line of the club is \"In search of a new frontier.\"\n\nKhulna University includes English Literature and English language in its curriculum. English discipline came into existence in 1998, but the academic activities started from 1999. A language centre was established. In Bangladesh, English Literature is a celebrated curriculum preferred by the students. The discipline is GPA-oriented.\n\nUnder Arts and Humanities School, English discipline offers one undergraduate and two postgraduate programmes; one of the two MAs is MA in English, with courses in contemporary literature in English, linguistics, and literary theory; the other is MA in English Language that teaches current theoretical and practical courses in English language and linguistics.\n\nEnvironmental Science as an undergraduate teaching programme is relatively a new one in this country. Khulna University opened the discipline in 1997. The subject incorporates physical, chemical and biological sciences, engineering and technology, socio-economics and management. The discipline offers a four-year undergraduate (Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science) and one and half years postgraduate (Master of Science in Environmental Science) degrees and offers a PhD programme.\n\nThe greater Khulna region, the south west part of Bangladesh has been characterised by a blend of aquatic habitats; fresh, brackish and marine waters supporting a diversity of biological and physical resources. Situated a few kilometres away from the Bay of Bengal this region is blessed with Sunderbans, the world largest mangrove forest crisscrossed by creeks and canals.\n\nUnderstanding the potential of such resources to the prospects of the country, the Fisheries and Marine Resources Technology Discipline was established in 1992 with a mandate to establish an avenue for research and academic programs in all aspects of fisheries for the second time in the country after Chittagong University. Chittagong University introduced undergraduate and postgraduate level education in Marine Science under the Institute of Marine Science and Fisheries (IMSCU) in early seventies . Over the last fourteen years the FMRT Discipline has experienced substantial growth resulting in a reputation for training and research, particularly with respect to coastal aquaculture and mangrove ecosystem.\n\nThe course followed in the discipline has provisions for education in biology, ecology, culture and post harvest fisheries. The course, in addition, involves socio-economics, statistics, GIS and remote sensing, computer application etc. The teaching staff of the discipline possess knowledge in fish biology, marine science, aquaculture, fisheries management, genetics and fish breeding, ecology, oceanography and post harvest technology. The FMRT discipline is now preparing to launch PhD courses in addition to BSc and M.S. ones.\n\nAfter the Institute of Forestry and Environmental Sciences of Chittagong University Forestry and Wood Technology (FWT) discipline launched its academic activities in 1992, offering a four-year Bachelor of Science (Honours) degree in Forestry and a one-year Master of Science (MS) degree in Forestry. The discipline is close to the world's largest single-tract mangrove forest, Sundarbans, and the forest-deficient northern region of the country where forest extension and social forestry programmes are increasingly realized. Given this geographic consideration, the mission of FWT discipline in education and research stresses on mangrove forestry, social forestry, forest management, forest tree improvement and wood science and technology.\n\nHistory and Civilization Discipline will start their journey from the academic year 2016–2017, offering a 4-year Bachelor of Arts degree (abbreviated as B.A. (Hons.)) in History and Civilization.\n\nHuman Resource Management (HRM) is a newly introduced discipline in Khulna University. The discipline has begun a Bachelor program from the academic year 2015–2016.\n\nLaw and Justice discipline is another new discipline of Khulna University, offering 4 years LLB(Hons) course from the academic year 2016–2017. Their LLM program will start soon.\n\nMass Communication and Journalism (MCJ) discipline is a newly introduced discipline, commencing a Bachelor program from academic year 2015–2016.\n\nThe Mathematics (Math) discipline was opened from the academic session 1998–99, offering a four-year undergraduate course leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Mathematics, abbreviated as BSc(Hon's) in Mathematics and Masters of Science in Applied Mathematics abbreviated as MSc in Applied Mathematics. This discipline also offers PhD program from researchers.\n\nMost of the present day medicines are directly or indirectly obtained from plants of local origin and those of the Sundarbans, a large source of medicinal plants. Some of the reported medicinal plants enjoy their use in the herbal preparation. But most of the plants need to be scientifically evaluated. To this end, Pharmacy Discipline started its academic activities in 1997 under Life Science School offering a four years Bachelor of Pharmacy (Hons.) degree with an aim of proper evaluation of the plants of medicinal value available in the mangrove forest as well as of medicinal plants in the native southern region.\n\nPhysics discipline started in the academic session 2009–2010. This discipline currently offers BSc(Hons.), MSc in Physics. This discipline is also enrolling students for M.Phil and PhD program in Physics.This discipline achieved two gold medalists and many trophy with volleyball inter discipline tournament.\n\nSoil Science Discipline at Khulna University has both an illustrious past and significant prospects for contributing to the future. Established in 1999 as Soil Science Discipline, it was renamed as Soil, Water and Environment Discipline in 2017. The current name reflects the expertise and areas where the department faculty and students can and are expected to make major contributions. The Discipline provides undergraduate and graduate teaching, conducts extensive research, and has significant extension outreach responsibilities. Because the soils, environment, and water resources vary greatly over the country, the discipline's activities are similarly widespread.\nThe course and curriculum provide graduates with knowledge in the field of Pedology, Hydrology, Soil Physics, Soil Chemistry, Soil Biochemistry, Soil Microbiology, Soil Ecology, Soil Mineralogy, Soil Survey, Land Evaluation, Soil Conservation, Sustainable Land use, Watershed Management, Irrigation & Drainage Technology, Groundwater Hydrology, Agronomy, Soil Fertility, Plant Nutrition, and Soil Management and others environmental related courses.\n\nThe discipline offers a four-year undergraduate programme leading to the BSc(Hons.) in Soil, Water and Environment degree. In 2008, a Masters programme was started.\n\nStarted in 2003, Sociology is one of the prominent disciplines of Khulna University under the Social Science School. The discipline offers a four-year Bachelor of Social Science (B.S.S.) Honors in Sociology degree as well as 1.5 years Masters of Social Science (M.S.S.). It also teaches students of almost all other disciplines of Khulna University to fulfill their course requirements.\n\nStatistics Discipline under Science, Engineering and Technology (SET) School is one of the new disciplines in Khulna University. It initiated its journey in 2011–2012 academic session. At undergraduate level, statistics discipline offer majors in statistics, and decision science which can be taken in BSc (Honors) degrees. At postgraduate level, advanced courses majoring in statistics have also been offered.\n\nThe discipline is distinguished by the faculty's strong interest in the application of statistics to such diverse areas such as public policy, economics, engineering, medicine and life sciences, law, and the social and behavioral sciences. The research areas which are mainly focused here include- Data Mining, Econometrics and Quality Control, Demography and Research Methods, Experimental Design and Inference, Sampling Techniques, Inferences and Multivariate Analysis, Time Series Analysis and Forecasting, Demography, Stochastic Process, Computer Package and Programming, Biostatistics and Reliability Theory, Health Statistics, Epidemiology, Bio-informatics, Environmental Statistics and so on.\n\nThe Urban and Rural Planning (URP) discipline was the earliest academic discipline in the country to impart planning education at undergraduate level, was established in Khulna University in 1991. It is one of the four disciplines with which Khulna University started its academic programme. The urban and rural planning discipline offers a four-year undergraduate degree in urban and rural planning. The discipline offers a master's degree programme in urban and rural planning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstitute of Education and Research :BEd, MEd, PGDEd.\n\nKhulna University Central library was established in 1987. Before, it was housed at Academic Building I, D block. The library room has a floor space of 5,000 sq. ft. (465 sq meters). The library has its own building now. The reading room has accommodation for 125 students, 25 teachers and research scholars working simultaneously. Khulna University library has a collection of 25,000 reading materials, including 23,000 books and 200 bound volumes of journals. The university library has a computer network for communication with national and international universities and institutions through the Internet.\n\nThe library is linked with the Automation and Networking of Science Technology Libraries in Bangladesh (BANSLINK) a pilot project of the Ministry of Science and Technology, government of Bangladesh and Bangladesh National Scientific and Technical Documentation Center (BANSDOC) is the executing agency of the Project. Khulna University also linked with Bangladesh Education and Research Network. (BERNET) Project organized by University Grants Commission (UGC), Bangladesh.\n\nThe central library is a Wi-Fi hotspot.\n\nThe university has five halls of residence for the students. Two more student halls are under process:\n\n"}

The DC-4E never entered production due to being superseded by an entirely new design, the Douglas DC-4/C-54, which proved very successful. Many DC-4E design features found their way into the Japanese Nakajima G5N bomber.\n\nThe design originated in 1935 from a requirement by United Air Lines. The goal was to develop a much larger and more sophisticated replacement for the DC-3 before the first DC-3 had even flown. There was enough interest from other airlines that American Airlines, Eastern Air Lines, Pan American Airways and Transcontinental and Western Air (TWA) joined United, providing $100,000 each toward the cost of developing the new aircraft. As cost and complexity rose, Pan American and TWA withdrew their funds in favor of the Boeing 307, which was anticipated to be less costly.\nWith a planned day capacity of 42 passengers (13 rows of two or more seats and a central aisle) or 30 as a sleeper transport (like the DST), the DC-4 (as it was then known) would seat twice as many people as the DC-3 and would be the first large aircraft with a nosewheel. Other innovations included auxiliary power units, power-boosted flight controls, alternating current electrical system and air conditioning. Cabin pressurization was also planned for production aircraft. The novel tail with three low vertical stabilizers enabled use of existing hangars and provided sufficient vertical fin area to allow the aircraft to take off with only two engines on one side operating. The wing planform was similar to the DC-3, with a swept leading edge and almost straight trailing edge. The four Pratt & Whitney R-2180-A Twin Hornet 14-cylinder radials were all mounted with noticeable toe-out, particularly the outer pair.\n\nThe prototype (\"NX18100\", s/n 1601) first flew, without incident, on June 7, 1938 from Clover Field in Santa Monica, California, piloted by Carl Cover. Testing issues, however, delayed the Approved Type Certificate until May 5, 1939. It was used by United Air Lines for in-service evaluation during 1939. On June 9, 1939, when the DC-4 was in Dayton, Ohio, along with Carl Cover, Orville Wright was a passenger on a flight over the city. Although the aircraft was relatively trouble-free, the complex systems proved to be expensive to maintain and performance was below expectations, especially with an increase in seating to 52 and gross weight to .\n\nThe design was abandoned in favor of a marginally smaller, less-complex four-engined design, with a single vertical fin and 21 feet (6.4 meters) shorter wingspan. This newer design was also designated DC-4, leading the earlier design to be redesignated DC-4E (E for \"experimental\"). In late 1939, the DC-4E was sold to Imperial Japanese Airways, which was buying American aircraft for evaluation and technology transfer during this period; it was reverse-engineered and became the basis for the unsuccessful Nakajima G5N bomber. The Japanese press reported shortly after purchase that the aircraft had crashed in Tokyo Bay, but it was being secretly studied by military and corporate interests at Nakajima.\n\n\n"}

He was the most famous organist in Italy in the mid-15th century.\n\nHe was born in Florence to a butcher with the family name of Giovanni; however he took the name of Squarcialupi, a well-known family from Tuscany, by mid-century, possibly to disguise his less than aristocratic origins. Most of his early life must have been spent in Florence, and he likely studied with both organist Giovanni Mazzuoli (also called Jovannes de Florentia, who was a pupil of Francesco Landini), as well as Matteo di Pagolo da Prato.\n\nHe acquired the post of organist at the Orsanmichele in Florence in 1431, but only remained there for two years, moving instead to the cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, at which post he remained for the rest of his life. He has been honored with a bust in this church.\n\nSquarcialupi was part of the court of Lorenzo de' Medici, and was also a colleague of Guillaume Dufay; there are numerous laudatory references to him in the middle of the 15th century, some, for instance that of diarist Luca Landucci, comparing him in stature to figures such as the sculptor Donatello. Evidently he was quite close to Lorenzo, and this is mentioned in his epitaph in Florence Cathedral.\n\nNone of his music has survived. His principal fame in music history, aside from his fame as an organist, is to have given his name to the splendid Squarcialupi Codex, a document he owned (but did not compile), and which is the richest source of music from Italy of the 14th century.\n\n"}

Zell) and Richard Genée, based on \"Les noces de Fernande\" by Victorien Sardou and \"The Lady of Lyons\" by Edward Bulwer-Lytton. However, the librettists added the element of combining love and politics to the French comedy plots. It premiered in Vienna in 1882. A German film adaptation, \"The Beggar Student\", was directed by Georg Jacoby in 1936 and a West German film adaptation, \"The Beggar Student\", was directed by Werner Jacobs in 1956.\n\nThe work was performed first at the Theater an der Wien, Vienna, on 6 December 1882. It was a success and allowed Millöcker to retire from conducting. Johann Strauss II rejected the libretto in favor of \"A Night in Venice\", but Millöcker's work turned out to be an enduringly popular operetta, with over 5,000 productions.\n\nThe piece played at the Thalia Theatre in New York City in 1883 and then in English at the Casino Theatre in 1883. It was revived in New York at least three times: in 1898 at the American Theatre, in 1899 at the American Theatre, and in 1913 at the Casino Theatre. It was also performed in London at the Alhambra Theatre in 1884, in a four-act version.\n\nThe operetta has been filmed at least four times – once in English (1931), and once as a silent film (1927). It has also been performed on German television. Recent productions in English include Ohio Light Opera (1996), and Light Opera Works (1991).\n\nColonel Ollendorf seeks revenge against Laura Nowalska, who rebuffed him with her fan, offended by his advances. Laura's mother declares that only a Pole and nobleman can be her son-in-law. He releases a seemingly penniless student and his friend (Symon and Janicki) to pose as a millionnaire and his aide, to entice the bankrupt but venerable Nowalska family. Laura agrees to marry Symon, and Janicki falls in love with Laura's sister.\n\nThe money that the colonel supplied to Symon is just about gone and he is no longer able to keep up the appearance of nobility. He and Laura have developed genuine feelings for each other and he struggles with the decision to tell her the truth. He writes a letter confessing the ruse. The colonel senses that the letter will end the plot, and convinces Laura's mother not to open it. When the wedding ceremony is over, the colonel reveals the truth about Symon, who is subsequently driven from the palace.\n\nSymon is contemplating suicide, when his friend Janicki reveals that he is a Polish officer and is part of a group of patriots who are planning to capture the citadel and to reinstate King Stanislaus. The Governor-General discovers that Janicki knows the whereabouts of the Polish grand duke and bribes him with 200,000 thalers to reveal his location to the Austrians. Janicki asks Symon to impersonate the grand duke until the money for his capture can be paid. The plot succeeds. In return, he is knighted by King Stanislaus and accepted by his wife and mother-in-law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It's the second game in the \"City Building\" series.\n\nWhen the game begins the Roman empire extends no further than Italy. Players have the opportunity to civilize adjacent barbarian provinces, eventually reaching the entire Roman Empire at its height. When a province is civilized it unlocks the surrounding provinces. A computerized rival also completes missions both preventing the player from civilizing that province and allowing them to civilize the provinces adjacent to it (the computer has been known to civilize a province it could not have selected when it successfully civilized the last, meaning it is a randomized event, rather than AI). Unlike \"Caesar III\", or \"Pharaoh\", the province and city are separate spheres, as is the military. The player builds primary industry (such as mines or farms), trade facilities (such as roads or docks), and military facilities (such as forts and walls) on one map and builds their city houses, secondary industry (such as wineries or potters), and tertiary industry (such as fire stations, police stations, bath houses) on another (represented as four squares in the center of the provincial map). Also unlike later games walkers are not required to bring services to people, which is instead determined by one buildings distance from another. Invading Armies differ from later games as well, in that Barbarian towns exist within many provinces from which Barbarian armies can emanate. These are converted to Roman towns through invading them and defeating the inhabitants. Most missions require the player to pacify a province and raise the citizens standard of living to a certain level, while neither suffering a military loss, nor losing the emperor's favour, often within a certain time frame. Major factors in city and province-building are housing values and types of housing, unemployment/labour shortages, taxes, wages, deficits, food shortages, military readiness and morale, and imperial demands. The game is won when the player has conquered sufficient provinces to attain the rank of Caesar. The game is lost if the player's computerized rival becomes Caesar, if Caesar removes the player from their post for running too large a deficit, for going beyond the time frame, for failing to follow Imperial demands, or having the city conquered.\n\nInitial reception of the game was positive. Arinn Dembo writing for \"Computer Gaming World\" gave the game 4 stars. A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" deemed it \"an innovative mix of \"SimCity\"-type building strategy and wargame campaign.\" He said the game's strongest point is how it expands from a city-building simulation into nation-building and wargames, but also highly praised the graphics and simple, easy-to-grasp interface. He scored the game 4 out of 5 stars.\n\n\"Caesar II\" was a runner-up for \"Computer Gaming World\"s 1995 \"Strategy Game of the Year\" award, which ultimately went to \"Command & Conquer\" and \"Heroes of Might and Magic\" (tie). The editors wrote that \"Caesar II\" \"surpassed the original with SVGA graphics and an actual combat module\", and noted that it \"could have won had the competition not been so strong.\" \"PC Gamer\" also nominated \"Caesar II\" as the best strategy game of 1995, although it lost to \"Command & Conquer\".\n\n\"Caesar II\" and its predecessor were named, collectively, the 96th best computer game ever by \"PC Gamer UK\" in 1997. The editors wrote, \"Impressions keep on keeping on with the likes of \"Lords of the Realm\" [...] but have never managed to regain the dizzy peak they climbed with their handsome brace of think-'em-ups.\"\n\nAccording to Sierra On-Line, combined sales of \"Caesar\" and \"Caesar II\" surpassed 400,000 units by the end of March 1996. \"Caesar II\" alone sold above 500,000 units by late 1998, and ultimately reached 2.5 million sales worldwide.\n\n"}

In 1976, the Parliament of Switzerland passed a bill for its construction, sponsored by Roger Bonvin, following an initial cost estimate of 76 million francs despite difficult geology.\n\nThe construction costs, however, had been deliberately lowballed to procure parliamentary support, and quickly rose to exceed 300 million Francs. The political fighting surrounding the cost overruns are said to have contributed to Roger Bonvin's ill health toward the end of the project and he died just before its opening in 1982. A plaque commemorating Roger Bonvin is installed as the base tunnel's entrance in Oberwald.\n\nIn its initial year of operation, the base tunnel was used to transport more than 75,000 passenger cars, trucks and buses.

These problems generally arise only in environments that don't have automatic garbage collection.\n\nAny lock-free data structure that uses the compare-and-swap primitive must deal with the ABA problem. For example, in a lock-free stack represented as an intrusively linked list, one thread may be attempting to pop an item from the front of the stack (A → B → C). It remembers the second-from-top value \"B\", and then performs \ncompare_and_swap(target=&head, newvalue=B, expected=A). Unfortunately, in the middle of this operation, another thread may have done two pops and then pushed A back on top, resulting in the stack (A → C). The compare-and-swap succeeds in swapping `head` with `B`, and the result is that the stack now contains garbage (a pointer to the freed element \"B\").\n\nFurthermore, any lock-free algorithm containing code of the form\n\nsuffers from another major problem, in the absence of automatic garbage collection. In between those two lines, it is possible that another thread may pop the node pointed to by codice_1 and deallocate it, meaning that the memory access through codice_2 on the second line reads deallocated memory (which may in fact already be in use by some other thread for a completely different purpose).\n\nHazard pointers can be used to address both of these problems. In a hazard-pointer system, each thread keeps a list of hazard pointers indicating which nodes the thread is currently accessing. (In many systems this \"list\" may be probably limited to only one or two elements.) Nodes on the hazard pointer list must not be modified or deallocated by any other thread.\n\nWhen a thread wishes to remove a node, it places it on a list of nodes \"to be freed later\", but does not actually deallocate the node's memory until no other thread's hazard list contains the pointer. This manual garbage collection can be done by a dedicated garbage-collection thread (if the list \"to be freed later\" is shared by all the threads); alternatively, cleaning up the \"to be freed\" list can be done by each worker thread as part of an operation such as \"pop\" (in which case each worker thread can be responsible for its own \"to be freed\" list).\n\nIn 2002, Maged Michael of IBM filed an application for a U.S. patent on the hazard pointer technique, but the application was abandoned in 2010.\n\nAlternatives to hazard pointers include reference counting.\n\n\n"}

He graduated from El Camino Real High School.\n\nHe attended California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, California after being rejected from the University of California, Santa Barbara twice. He was able to transfer to UCSB for his junior year, where he graduated with a degree in Political Science in 1989.\n\nGermain’s first venture into radio came at the age of twelve in 1979. His father, wanting a hobby for each of his sons bought Germain a ham radio. Taking the amateur radio test twice, he was unable to pass the algebra content of the test due to his age (although he did pass the Morse code portion \"which was very easy\"). He was only able to use the radio to receive and not to transmit. However this was also the time of the citizens' band radio boom, so he obtained a citizens' band radio, and was able to acquire a then-necessary license for that. As stated by Germain, he was mostly active on channel 19 and went by the handle of “King Cobra”.\n\nWhile completing his degree at UCSB, Germain felt drawn to the business of talk radio. Germain called local radio station KTMS and offered his services to get a break in the radio industry. He was initially rejected, but through UCSB's campus job placement center was able to secure an internship. Within a year and a half, Germain was the assistant program director.\n\nGermain returned to Los Angeles and landed a job at radio station KFI. After assignments screening phone calls for the station, Germain was given his own weeknight show, \"Ask Mr. KFI\".\n\nWhen KFI moved Phil Hendrie's show into Germain's time slot in 1996, the station offered him a different time slot, which Germain refused and led to him departing KFI.\n\nIn January 1997 after a 3-month contractually mandated non-competition period, Germain brought his show to KABC as \"Ask Mr. KABC\". As part of promoting his show on the new station, newspaper ads ran in Los Angeles area papers claiming that Mr. KABC had been switched at birth and that explained his time as Mr. KFI. Later he would sometimes be known simply as \"Mr. K\". Initially, the show received poor ratings due to inconsistent time slots. The show was frequently preempted by Los Angeles Dodgers games while Germain also spent time filling in as a morning talk show co-host with Brian Whitman.\n\nGermain's show began to blossom in March 2000 when KABC management dropped Stephanie Miller's syndicated show and increased the run-time of \"Ask Mr. KABC\" from one hour to three hours, occupying the two hours that Miller's show previously held. Germain stated, \"Her [Miller's] show was cancelled because the station believes that I am a better fit and that my ratings are on the rise.\"\n\nMidway through 2006, KABC pushed the start of his show back an hour to make room for a syndicated show from New York hosted by Mark Levin. In early 2007, KABC wanted to push Germain's show later in the evening for another hour of Levin's show. KABC and Germain couldn't come to an agreement, with Germain citing family considerations, and the two agreed to part ways.\n\nIt was announced in March 2007 that Germain had joined a revamped KTLK lineup, which had just dropped its Air America affiliation. However, Germain's stint with KTLK was short lived with his show being cancelled in December 2007.\n\nIn July 2008, Germain launched Talk Radio One, an internet only \"radio\" show. At first the shows were \"Skype-cast\" and he mainly talked to others around the world via Skype. When Skype ended that aspect of service on September 1, 2008, Germain resorted to a mixture of live shows and podcasts.\n\nIn November 2008, Germain filled in at KGO.\n\nIn February 2010, Germain joined Doug McIntyre and \"Red Eye Radio\". The production, a part of Cumulus Media Networks, was heard nationally. The show ended in December 2011 when Cumulus handed the show over to two different hosts.\n\nHis wife, Ann, is from Long Island, New York. The two met after she hired him to work at KFI. They have been married since July 1992, and have a daughter and a son. Germain and his family left the Los Angeles area and relocated to Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nGermain is the youngest of four sons. His brother, Paul Germain, is an animation screenwriter and producer best known for \"Rugrats,\" \"Recess\", and \"Lloyd in Space\".\n\n"}

Similar belts are used by the various Robins, Batgirl, and other members of the Bat-family.\n\nBatman historian Les Daniels credits Gardner Fox, the first writer other than Bill Finger to write the adventures of Batman in \"Detective Comics\", with introducing the utility belt concept in \"Detective Comics\" #29 (July 1939). In its first appearance, Batman's utility belt \"contain[ed] choking gas capsules.\" Two issues after the utility belt debuted, Fox also wrote the first appearance of a bat-themed weapon, when the batarang debuted in the story \"Batman vs. the Vampire\" in \"Detective Comics\" #31 (Sep 1939).\n\nUp until 1989, most artists drew the utility belt as a simple yellow belt with a buckle and capsules/cylinders around it. In 1986, Frank Miller drew Batman's utility belt with military-style pouches in the \"\" limited series. This rendition was used again in \"\" and used by almost every artist in the \"Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight\" comics series. In 2000, the pouches became a standard feature in the depiction of the utility belt.\n\nThe grapple gun, which fired the Batline/Bat-rope (it had to be thrown manually prior to that), was first introduced in Tim Burton's live-action film, \"Batman\". One feature added to the utility belt in the film and its sequel \"Batman Returns\", was a small motor which would move items from the back of the belt around to the front allowing Batman easier access to his weaponry and tools.\n\nAlthough seemingly unremarkable in appearance, the utility belt is one of Batman's most important tools in fighting crime. Consisting primarily of a strap and buckle, the utility belt houses ten pouches or cylindrical cartridges that are attached to the outside of the belt. The buckle itself typically contains a miniature camera and a tape recorder. A secondary compartment behind the length of the belt houses Batman's supply of batarangs.\n\nEach of the ten pouches or cylinders contains various tools integral to Batman's war on crime, with the cylinders being interchangeable with each other. Through the years, Batman has modified the contents of his belt to accommodate various crime-fighting scenarios.\n\nMost versions of the belt contain security features to prevent anyone other than Batman from opening it. The belt is shown to be able to electrocute any villain who even touches it. It can also release stun gas to prevent tampering. The belt's compartments are locked and only Batman knows how to open them.\n\nElements of the utility belt at times include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2098117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2098117", "title": "Kokoda Track campaign", "text": "Kokoda Track campaign\n\nThe Kokoda Track campaign or Kokoda Trail campaign was part of the Pacific War of World War II. The campaign consisted of a series of battles fought between July and November 1942 in what was then the Australian Territory of Papua. It was primarily a land battle, between the Japanese South Seas Detachment under Major General Tomitarō Horii and Australian and Papuan land forces under command of New Guinea Force. The Japanese objective was to seize Port Moresby by an overland advance from the north coast, following the Kokoda Track over the mountains of the Owen Stanley Range, as part of a strategy to isolate Australia from the United States.\n\nJapanese forces landed and established beachheads near Gona and Buna on 21 July 1942. Opposed by Maroubra Force, then consisting of four platoons of the 39th Battalion and elements of the Papuan Infantry Battalion, they quickly advanced and captured Kokoda and its strategically vital airfield on 29 July. Despite reinforcement, the Australian forces were continually pushed back. The veteran Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) 21st Brigade narrowly avoided capture in the Battle of Mission Ridge – Brigade Hill from 6 to 8 September. In the Battle of Ioribaiwa from 13 to 16 September, the 25th Brigade under Brigadier Kenneth Eather fought the Japanese to a halt but ceded the field to the Japanese, withdrawing to Imita Ridge.\n\nThe Japanese advanced to within sight of Port Moresby but withdrew on 26 September. They had outrun their supply line and had been ordered to withdraw in consequence of reverses suffered at Guadalcanal. The Australian pursuit encountered strong opposition from well-prepared positions around Templeton's Crossing and Eora Village from 11 to 28 October. Following the unopposed recapture of Kokoda, a major battle was fought around Oivi and Gorari from 4 to 11 November, resulting in a victory for the Australians. By 16 November, two brigades of the Australian 7th Division had crossed the Kumusi River at Wairopi, and advanced on the Japanese beachheads in a joint Australian and United States operation. The Japanese forces at Buna–Gona held out until 22 January 1943.\n\nAustralian reinforcement was hampered by the logistical problems of supporting a force in isolated, mountainous, jungle terrain. There were few planes available for aerial resupply, and techniques for it were still primitive. Australian command considered that the Vickers machine gun and medium mortars were too heavy to carry and would be ineffective in the jungle terrain. Without artillery, mortars or medium machine guns, the Australians faced an opponent equipped with mountain guns and light howitzers that had been carried into the mountains and proved to be a decisive advantage. Australian forces were unprepared to conduct a campaign in the jungle environment of New Guinea. The lessons learned during the course of this campaign and the subsequent battle of Buna–Gona led to widespread changes in doctrine, training, equipment and structure, with a legacy that remains until the present day.\n\nIn consequence of the rapid Japanese advance and the perceived failure to quickly counterattack, a \"crisis of command\" resulted, in which manoeuvring by General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in the South West Pacific Area, and General Sir Thomas Blamey, commander of Allied Land Forces, resulted in the sackings of three high-ranking Australian officers. The generalship of MacArthur and Blamey has been criticised for unreasonable and unrealistic perceptions of the terrain and conditions under which the campaign was fought—to the detriment of the troops committed to the fighting. The Kokoda Track campaign has been mythologised as Australia's Thermopylae and incorporated into the Anzac legend even though the premise of a vastly numerically-superior enemy has since been shown to be incorrect.\n\nAfter the fall of Singapore, the Australian government and many Australians feared that Japan would invade the Australian mainland. Australia was ill-prepared to counter such an attack. The entire 8th Division, deployed to Malaya, Ambon, Timor and Rabaul, was lost or rendered ineffective as the Japanese rapidly advanced. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) lacked modern aircraft and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) was too small to counter the Imperial Japanese Navy. The RAAF and RAN were greatly expanded, though it took years for these services to build up to their peak strengths. The Militia was mobilised but, although a large force, it was inexperienced and lacked modern equipment. In response to the threat, the Government appealed to the United States for assistance, and the 6th and 7th Divisions of the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) were brought back from the Middle East. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill attempted to divert them to Burma, but the Australian Prime Minister, John Curtin, refused to authorise this movement. As a compromise, two brigades of the 6th Division disembarked at Ceylon, where they formed part of the garrison until they returned to Australia in August 1942.\n\nThe Japanese Imperial General Headquarters considered invading Australia in early 1942 but decided against doing so in February that year, as it was judged to be beyond the Japanese capabilities, and no planning or preparations were undertaken. Instead, in March 1942 the Japanese military adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States and preventing Allied offensive operations by capturing Port Moresby, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Samoa and New Caledonia. An attempt to capture Port Moresby by an amphibious assault, Operation Mo, was thwarted by the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942. A month later, most of the Japanese carrier fleet was destroyed in the Battle of Midway, further reducing the possibility of major amphibious operations in the South Pacific. Following this, the Japanese began to consider an overland advance on Port Moresby.\nMeanwhile, the Allied Supreme Commander in the South West Pacific Area, General Douglas MacArthur set about developing airfields for the defence of Port Moresby, and to strike against the Japanese. The first of these, Operation Boston, was authorised on 20 May and initially planned for the Abau–Mullins Harbor area. Milne Bay was subsequently determined to be preferable and a garrison force was sent by ship from Port Moresby on 22 June. Another strip at Merauke, on the south coast of Dutch New Guinea was authorised on 22 June to protect the western flank. On 9 June, MacArthur questioned General Sir Thomas Blamey, the commander of Allied Land Forces, as to measures taken for the defence of the overland approach from Buna. This set in train the deployment of forces to Kokoda. MacArthur began to consider the development of an airfield in the Buna area. An initial reconnaissance, landed by flying boat, was conducted on 10 and 11 July. Orders for the airfield construction, Operation Providence, were received by New Guinea Force (NGF) on 17 July, but were postponed by seven days on 18 July, and cancelled following the Japanese landings that shortly followed.\n\nIn 1942, Papua was a territory of Australia. There had been little development and it was largely devoid of infrastructure beyond that around Port Moresby. The pre-war economy was based primarily upon copra and rubber—with plantations established intermittently in coastal regions—and mining. The administrative centre of Port Moresby had basic airfield and port facilities. There were no roads beyond the vicinity of Port Moresby and, by modern standards, these were little more than tracks. As a result, travel north of Port Moresby was largely undertaken by air, or sea. There were a few landing fields around Port Moresby, with others on the northern side of the Owen Stanley Range at the government stations of Buna and Kokoda.\n\nThe village of Kokoda is positioned on a plateau in northern foot-hills of the Owen Stanley Range. It overlooks the Yodda Valley (formed by the Mambare River) to its north. The Mambare runs roughly south-east to north-west. Kokoda is approximately direct line from the coastal village of Buna, which formed part of the Japanese beachhead positions occupied on their landing. However, the overland route was approximately . The track to the coast crosses the Kumusi River at Wairopi, approximately east of Kokoda. The river was spanned there by a wire-rope bridge (Wairopi being Pidgin for wire rope). There was a wide track leading from there to the coast which the Japanese subsequently set about developing as a road for vehicle traffic.\n\nIn 1942, the village was the site of a government station, rubber plantation and strategically important airstrip. The Kokoda Track is a foot track that runs roughly southwest from Kokoda overland ( in a straight line) through the Owen Stanley Range towards Port Moresby. It was known before the war and had been used as an overland mail route. While there is a \"main track\" that is associated with the fighting during the campaign, there are many parallel, interlocking tracks that follow much the same general course. The southern end of the track is now considered to start at Owers' Corner, from Port Moresby. The vehicle track from Port Moresby originally terminated at McDonald's [Corner], where it serviced the McDonald homestead. Between June and late September 1942, around of road was completed, extending it to Owers' Corner.\n\nThe Kokoda Track passed through what was referred to during the early war years as \"the (Kokoda) Gap\". To the Japanese, who had learned of the Gap through vague explorer's accounts, it potentially offered a corridor from Buna through the Owen Stanleys along which they could launch a quick advance on Port Moresby. Conversely, the Allies believed it was a narrow and largely impassable path that could be blocked and held with only limited resources. In reality, the Gap is a dip in the Owen Stanley Range about wide, convenient for aircraft crossing the range to pass through.\n\nThe track reaches a height of as it passes around the peak of Mount Bellamy. The terrain rises and falls with regularity, up to up and down over the full length of the track. This markedly increases the distance to be traversed, although there are several flat areas, particularly around Myola. The vegetation is largely dense jungle. The climate is mostly hot and humid with high rainfall, although the higher parts are cold, particularly at night. The higher elevations are frequently above cloud level, resulting in fog.\n\nMyola is close to the watershed. A stream flowing from Myola is part of the headwaters of Eora Creek on the northern watershed. On the northern part of the track, its course, to Deniki, is determined by Eora Creek. It follows along the side of the steep valley formed by the creek. It crosses the creek from one side to the other at several points along its course. From Deniki, the track descends to the Kokoda plateau.\n\nOperations in New Guinea were impacted by tropical diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, scrub typhus, tropical ulcers, dysentery from a range of causes and fungal infections. Walker observes that the Kokoda Track \"starts and ends with malaria\". Malarial vectors were substantially absent from the cooler, higher elevations along the track. Most cases observed in these areas were relapses rather than primary infections. The immediate vicinity of Port Moresby is relatively dry. While this tends to mitigate the risk of malaria, significant rates of the disease were observed in troops, mainly militia, sent to New Guinea for defence of the port, leading up to the campaign. The risk from malaria was particularly high for troops operating in the coastal area around the southern end of the track and when the Australian forces had been forced back to Imita Ridge. AIF units returning from the Middle East were more aware of the threat this disease posed and arrived with supplies of quinine. For these reasons, the disease did not have the same degree of significance or impact on operations as it did at Milne Bay or the subsequent operations at Buna–Gona.\n\nAnderson recounts the prevalence of dysentery among Australian troops, while James reports that \"more and more [Japanese] succumbed\" to diseases, including dysentery, as they withdrew along the track. Walker attributes enteric infections to poor field hygiene, contaminated and unpurified water, and a failure to make adequate sanitary provisions along the track during the early part of the campaign. He also identifies that a proportion of diarrhoeal disturbances were attributable to the poor diet (particularly the high-fat content of tinned beef) rather than infection.\n\nThe Japanese 17th Army under Lieutenant General Harukichi Hyakutake was a corps-sized command, based at Rabaul, involved in the New Guinea, Guadalcanal, and Solomon Islands campaigns. Following Coral Sea, the 17th Army considered an overland advance on Port Moresby. This was based on pre-war intelligence that a road existed linking it with Kokoda. Initial aerial reconnaissance was inconclusive but plans were made for a reconnaissance in force and to exploit the possibility of an advance along such a route. The 15th Independent Engineer Regiment (less one company) and the South Seas Detachment under Major General Tomitarō Horii were assigned to these tasks. At the time, Horii was unenthusiastic as to the possibility of success, in consideration of the logistical difficulties that would be faced, but he did not press his objection.\n\nAn advance party, under command of Colonel Yokoyama Yosuke of the 15th Independent Engineer Regiment was to consist of the main force of the regiment, the 1st Battalion of the 144th Infantry Regiment, and the 1st Company, 1st Battalion of the 55th Mountain Artillery Regiment. It also included 500 Korean and Formosan labourers and 2,000 native labourers from Rabaul. A naval force based on the 5th Yokosuka Naval Landing Party was to land at the same time as the advance party and commence construction of an airfield at Buna. Japanese planning proceeded on the premise that an overland assault would occur.\n\nThe initial landing took place from the evening of 21 July 1942. An infantry company was immediately dispatched towards Kokoda. A second component of the Yokoyama landing party arrived on 29 July. The landing was reinforced by successive convoys over the following weeks. The main force of the 144th Infantry Regiment landed on 18 August. The 41st Infantry Regiment (less 1st Battalion) landed on 21 August, with the 1st Battalion landing on 27 August.\n\nHorii linked up with the advance party at Kokoda and began to assemble his force for the overland advance. By 26 August, it consisted of the 144th Infantry Regiment (three battalions), the 41st Infantry Regiment (2nd and 3rd Battalions, with the 1st Battalion yet to arrive—joining the main force on 14 September) and 1st Battalion, 55th Mountain Artillery Regiment. The 3rd Battalion was tasked with protecting the force's line-of-communication. The 41st Infantry Regiment fielded only 1,900 troops since both the 1st and 3rd Battalions had approximately 400 detached from each for road construction and supply tasks. The force has been estimated at 6,000. Horii commenced his advance with each man carrying sixteen days' rations. Troops of both regiments were seasoned veterans. The 41st Infantry Regiment had fought against Australians in Malaya.\n\nThe Australian territories of Papua and New Guinea formed the 8th Military District of Australia (subsequently designated New Guinea Force) under command of Brigadier Basil Morris. As war in the Pacific approached, there were two local militia units: the Papuan Infantry Battalion (PIB) and the New Guinea Volunteer Rifles. With growing tensions, the 49th Battalion was sent to Port Moresby in March 1941. On 3 January 1942, the 49th Battalion was joined by the 39th and 53rd Battalions under command of the 30th Brigade.\n\nAt the end of May, the force protecting Port Moresby was increased by the 14th Brigade, consisting of the 3rd, 36th and 55th Battalions. The militia units were considered poorly trained, though some effort was taken to infuse them with experienced junior officers, most of their time in New Guinea was spent labouring rather than training. Morale in the 53rd Battalion was particularly low. A draft, numbering about one hundred, was drawn from other militia units on short notice. With embarkation in late December, they were denied Christmas leave. Destined for North Queensland they were diverted to New Guinea en route. The disaffection undermined morale and has been cited as a significant factor in respect of the battalion's subsequent performance.\n\nAs well as defending Port Moresby, New Guinea Force commanded operations against the Japanese landings around Wau, that occurred on 8 March 1942, and was commencing development of an air base at Milne Bay. The 7th Division of the 2nd AIF was poised to deploy to New Guinea—its 21st and 25th Brigades would be assigned to the defence of Port Moresby, while its 18th Brigade would be sent to Milne Bay.\n\nOn 12 June 1942, Morris ordered the PIB to patrol a wide area of the north coast around: Ioma, located approximately north-northeast of Kokoda; Awala, between Kokoda and Gona; and, Tufi, on Cape Nelson – with headquarters at Kokoda. The battalion, commanded by Major William Watson, consisted of three companies with a total strength of 310, including 30 Europeans – mainly officers and senior non-commissioned officers. Its role was reconnaissance. There were indications of Japanese plans to land in the vicinity of Buna. On 22 June Morris received orders from LHQ to deploy \"Australian infantry\" to Kokoda for the forward defence of Port Moresby.\n\nAbout the middle of July, GHQ was planning Operation Providence for development of an airstrip in the vicinity of Buna. When orders were issued to Morris for the Providence operation on 17 July, he intended to use the 39th Battalion as the force required under the plan to garrison the Buna area. The initial deployment of the 39th Battalion had an entirely different aim though. Author, Eustace Keogh, clarifies this:\n\nOn 23 June, an initial order was given for a company of the 39th Battalion to deploy to Kokoda with the possibility of it being joined by the rest of the battalion. This was amended on 24 June for deployment of the battalion (less one company). The instrument for this was NGF Operational Instruction 18. It placed the PIB under command of the 39th Battalion. It also assigned detachments of service units in support. Attachments were placed under command of Lieutenant Colonel William Owen, commanding officer of the 39th Battalion. \"Maroubra\" was assigned as the code word. An advance party, the battalion's B Company, assembled at Illolo. Departing on 8 July, it arrived at Kokoda on 15 July.\n\nAs a code word, \"Maroubra\" continued to be used throughout the campaign to refer to operations along the track and the Australian forces deployed forward—even though references to \"Maroubra Force\" in sources is somewhat enigmatic.\n\nThe Japanese landings around Buna and Gona saw B Company of the 39th Battalion in position at Kokoda and C Company advancing along the track, departing Illolo on 23 July. The remainder of the battalion was poised to move and most of the battalion had arrived at Deniki by 4 August.\n\nIn the early evening of 21 July 1942, Japanese troops landed close to Gona. The Japanese advance party moved rapidly towards Kokoda, reaching the Kumusi, at Wairopi in the afternoon of 23 July. The PIB and Australians engaged the advancing Japanese with ambushes. B Company, 39th Battalion assembled a force (including what remained of the PIB) to make a stand near Oivi on 26 July. One platoon remained at Kokoda. Threatened with encirclement, the force at Oivi withdrew south to Deniki. Having lost contact, the platoon at Kokoda also withdrew to Deniki on 27 July. With the force reassembled, it reoccupied the village unopposed on 28 July. The first battle at Kokoda was fought over 28–29 July. Repeated, determined attacks caused the Australians to withdraw to Deniki. Owen, commanding officer of the 39th Battalion, was mortally wounded in the fighting.\n\nThere was a pause in the Japanese advance. Remaining companies of the 39th Battalion arrived overland and Major Allan Cameron, Brigade Major of the 30th Brigade was appointed to assume command of the force. He planned an attack for 8 August towards Kokoda, with three companies advancing on different lines. Two of the companies were held up and forced to retire. A Company was able to occupy Kokoda but, isolated and under attack, it withdrew during the night of 9 August. Companies of the 39th Battalion had withdrawn to Deniki by 12 August and were attacked the following morning. With the threat of envelopment, the battalion commenced to withdraw towards Isurava on the morning of 14 August.\n\nMeanwhile, the 53rd Battalion and headquarters 30th Brigade under Brigadier Selwyn Porter were sent as reinforcements. Two battalions of the 2nd AIF's 21st Brigade under Brigadier Arnold Potts were following. A defensive position was established by Porter at Isurava with the 30th Brigade to be relieved by the 21st Brigade force. As Potts' lead battalion approached, he took command of the combined force to effect the relief. However, the Japanese advance overtook events and, from 26 to 31 August, a battle ensued in which four Japanese battalions were committed. The 53rd Battalion failed to secure the eastern flank and, with the Japanese taking a commanding position to the Australian front, ultimately forced an Australian withdrawal. The 21st Brigade then fought a series of engagements between 31 August and 5 September as it withdrew from Eora Village to Templeton's Crossing.\n\nThe Japanese had landed at Milne Bay on 25 August but, as the Australian position there firmed, the third battalion of Potts' 21st Brigade was released to join the fighting along the track. With this reinforcement, he determined to make a stand on Mission Ridge, running forward from Brigade Hill. In fighting from 6 to 9 September, two battalions of the brigade withdrew, narrowly avoiding encirclement while the 2/27th Battalion was feared lost until its remnants emerged from the jungle three weeks later.\n\nFollowing the battle, Potts was recalled to Port Moresby, with Porter being placed in command. The depleted 21st Brigade was withdrawn to Ioribaiwa Ridge. It was reinforced by the 3rd Battalion and awaited relief by the 25th Brigade, under command of Eather. Eather took command of the combined force but the Japanese attacked just as his battalions were taking up position—with fighting over the period 14 to 16 September. He obtained permission to withdraw and consolidate at Imita Ridge—the final defensive position along the Track. Meanwhile, American forces had landed at Guadalcanal on 7 August. Unable to support both operations, Horii was ordered to withdraw. When Eather attacked the Japanese positions on 28 September, he found them abandoned. The Australian forces cautiously pursued the Japanese withdrawal. The 16th Brigade was committed to the advance and direct command passed to the 7th Division, under Major General Arthur \"Tubby\" Allen.\n\nThe 25th Brigade took the vanguard. On 10 October, Myola was occupied unopposed and contact was made with the Japanese defence. The 25th Brigade was held up at Templeton's Crossing from 16 October until the 16th Brigade pushed through on 20 October and advanced towards Eora Village. Here, the advance was held until the Japanese forces withdrew on 28 October. Pressured to hasten the advance by MacArthur, Allan was replaced by Major General George Vasey on 28 October. The 7th Division advanced towards Kokoda and, when a patrol reported it unoccupied, it was retaken on 2 November.\n\nA further battle was fought around Oivi and Gorari from 4 to 11 November. Vasey was able to turn the flank and rout the Japanese. On 15 November, the 7th Division crossed the Kumusi River and commenced its advance towards the beachheads at Buna–Gona.\n\nAs the Kokoda Track campaign was taking place, a Japanese invasion force made up of Japanese Special Naval Landing Force units attempted to capture the strategically valuable Milne Bay area on the eastern tip of New Guinea in August 1942. The Battle of Milne Bay, fought from 25 August to 7 September 1942, resulted in a Japanese defeat. This was the first notable Japanese land defeat and raised Allied morale across the Pacific Theatre.\n\nAllied forces identified a Japanese airfield under construction at Guadalcanal, and 19,000 US Marines were embarked to capture the airfield. An amphibious landing was made on 7 August. The battle lasted until 9 February 1943 and was strongly contested, on land, at sea and in the air. Hyakutake's initial thrust on 14 September to re-take the island's Henderson Field was defeated. In an unequal battle, Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi's forces lost about 850 killed, while the American Marines lost 104. When the news reached Imperial General Headquarters in Japan, they decided in an emergency session that they could not support fronts in both New Guinea and at Guadalcanal. Hyakutake decided that he only had sufficient troops and material to defeat the Allied forces on Guadalcanal. He prepared to send more troops to Guadalcanal in another attempt to recapture the airfield. With the concurrence of the Japanese command staff, he ordered Horii to withdraw his troops on the Kokoda Track until the issue at Guadalcanal was decided. The Japanese troops were, after several weeks of exhausting fighting and heavy losses, at Ioribaiwa, within of Port Moresby. There were also concerns that Allied forces might land at Buna at any time.\n\nBullard, in the introduction to his translation observes:\nThese instructions to halt the advance appear to date from as early as 16 August: \"Senior Japanese officers interviewed after the war thought that the factor most influencing the postponement was not Guadalcanal but rather 'stronger than anticipated Australian resistance at Kokoda.'\"\n\nBullard reports orders to Horii of 28 August, \"[to] advance to the southern slopes of the Owen Stanley Range ... but amass your main strength on the north side of the range in preparation for future operations\". Bullard notes a degree of ambiguity with respect to defining the \"southern slopes\". On 8 September, the 17th Army ordered Horii to assemble the 41st Regiment in the Kokoda area. Horii did draw back the main body of his force but continued to thrust forward. When, on the 19 September, Hyakutake became aware that Ioribaiwa had been occupied on 16 September, he \"issued strict orders for front-line troops to immediately occupy a position to the north of Mawai\". An order of 23 September was to secure the Isurava–Kokoda area as \"a base for future operations\". Horii had out-run his supply line and therefore his force was faced with extreme rationing and was unable to advance any further. On 24 September, the 2nd/144th Battalion withdrew from Ioribaiwa. The 3rd/144th Battalion formed the rearguard and withdrew during the night of 26 September.\n\nThis campaign and the battle that followed at the Japanese beachheads around Buna and Gona were defined, for both sides, by the limitations imposed by terrain and the capability to supply and maintain their forces under the conditions they faced. Morris said to Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell on handing over command of NGF, \"The mountains will beat the Nips and we must be careful they don’t beat us.\"\n\nSubstantially devoid of infrastructure, Morris had set about an ongoing programme to expand, improve and develop harbour and airfield facilities at Port Moresby. Opened in early October, a T-shaped wharf was constructed on Tatana Island. It more than doubled the capacity of the port. Under orders from GHQ, an airfield and subsequent port facilities were developed at Milne Bay. This saw Allied forces fortuitously placed to counter the Japanese landing that occurred there. Roads were virtually non-existent. In concert with orders to deploy Maroubra Force to Kokoda, Lieutenant Bert Kienzle was ordered to construct an overland road for its resupply. Historian Peter Brune describes it as \"one of the most ludicrous\" orders ever given. Just over of road was completed by the end of September 1942, from McDonald's to Owers' Corner.\n\nKienzle guided Templeton's B Company of the 39th Battalion across the track to Kokoda. As they went, Kienzle identified staging points along the track and made arrangements for provisioning them. When they arrived at Kokoda, food was running low. Kienzle made a brief visit to his homestead in the Yodda Valley and returned with supplies. The trek was considered too arduous for the soldiers to carry any heavy equipment. Arrangements had been made for a coastal vessel to transport supplies and other equipment to Buna. It was unloaded the day prior to the Japanese commencing their landings at Basabua, northward around the coast, near Gona. While Kokoda was held, it was possible to resupply by air landing. Owen flew into Kokoda to take command on 24 July. On 26 July, a platoon of D Company was landed. Lacking serviceable aircraft, this was done in two lifts by a single plane.\n\nHaving returned overland, Kienzle made a report on the supply situation. A porter could carry a load equivalent to 13 days' rations. If he carried rations for a soldier, between them, they would consume the load in 6½ days. This made no allowance for ammunition, other necessary equipment or the porter's return. The trek to Kokoda was 8 days. He concluded that operations could not be sustained without large scale air drops occurring. Aerial resupply commenced with drop sites at Kagi and Efogi but neither site was particularly suitable. Significant quantities fell outside the drop zone and could not be recovered. Unreliable maps or poor visibility in the drop zone meant that supplies were often misdropped. Recognising that a better drop zone was needed, Kienzle set out on 1 August, to find a large open area he recalled having seen from the air. On 3 August, he identified the smaller of two dry lake beds near the crest of the range, which he called Myola. Kienzle immediately requested that dropping begin at Myola. Access to this large area alleviated the proportion of supplies lost to the jungle. It also made the task of carriers achievable. He set about establishing it as a supply camp and cut a new track towards Eora Creek. It joined the existing track at Templeton's Crossing, which he also named.\n\nWhile the discovery of Myola alleviated one of the problems associated with resupply, it did not solve them all. Air drops requested during the second battle at Kokoda were delayed by weather—which frequently interfered with air operations over the range. At the start of the campaign, effective air dropping techniques had not been developed. Belated drops to Kokoda were made by fighters because of the lack of transports. Belly tanks were filled with supplies but this could not be widely used. Parachutes were not initially available and, after a quantity were delivered in mid-September, remained in short supply and were reserved for essential equipment. Most supplies were \"free dropped\". Packaging was primitive by modern standards. Supplies were wrapped in blankets or tied in sacks. There was, however, a conscious choice to utilise packing, such as blankets, that were required by the troops and might otherwise have been supplied separately. The rate of breakage and loss was high—on average, 50 per cent and up to 90 per cent. Lieutenant Fayle, Allen's aide-de-camp, commented that: \"The whole fact of the matter, and NGF seemed unable to understand all through the campaign, was that recoveries were never 100 per cent of the supplies dropped and wastage was at times terrific.\"\n\nThe lack of transport aircraft was another constraint. On 5 August, the only two aircraft available for supply work returned to Australia. On 17 August, a Japanese air raid on Port Moresby destroyed five aircraft and severely damaged eleven others when the aircraft had been parked close together. Of these, seven transports (later dubbed \"biscuit bombers\") were destroyed or put out of commission, leaving only one in service. This report by Gillison is indicative since there is considerable variation in the sources as to the number and type of planes damaged and destroyed. What is clear is that this was a disastrous event that significantly curtailed the Allied capacity to resupply the troops fighting along the track. Moremon says that no aircraft were available for dropping until 23 August while McCathy states this as 22 August. Given the tenuous supply situation, this was a significant break. Civilian aircraft and pilots were pressed into service in an effort to meet demand. They were mainly used in flights between Australia and New Guinea or in rear areas in order to release military planes and personnel for service in forward areas but this did not solve the immediate problem.\n\nPotts' two battalions commenced their advance along the track on the basis that 40,000 rations plus ammunition and other supplies had been stockpiled at Myola and additional supplies existed at staging points along the route. Potts arrived at Myola on 21 August to find only 8,000 rations (five days' reserve) and a further two days' reserve forward. Potts was forced to hold his force at Myola until a sufficient reserve could be accumulated—which impacted his conduct of the battle at Isurava (commencing 26 August).\n\nThe \"missing\" rations have been the subject of investigation—both at the time and subsequently. Dudley McCarthy, the Australian official historian, concluded that the reason most likely lay in \"faulty [staff] work by inexperienced staff\". Rowell's investigation, made at the time, determined that the rations had been dispatched. The second and much larger, dry lake bed, Myola 2, was discovered by a patrol on 21 August. At this time, maps showed and air crew expected only one. John Moremon hypothesises that drops were likely made at the wrong one. Rowell noted in his memoirs that \"all through the New Guinea Campaign cargo dropping remained notoriously unreliable\".\n\nIn consequence of this short-fall and the earlier loss of transports at Port Moresby, urgent requests were forwarded by Rowell through the chain-of-command. Transport aircraft in the theatre at this time were largely operated by the Fifth Air Force, with Major General George Kenney commanding Allied Air Forces. MacArthur released six Douglas Dauntless dive bombers, one B-17 Flying Fortress and two transports. He noted that, at the time, there were only thirty transport planes in Australia and, of these, only 50 per cent were available at any one time. His response stated that the resources being made available should be sufficient for the of supplies necessary to supply forces at Wau and along the track (as estimated by Rowell) each day. The figure supplied by Rowell explicitly did not allow for any reserve to be established. MacArthur concluded by saying:\nWhen Potts asked for some additional 800 labourers to help alleviate the supply situation, Rowell replied that only 300 could be provided. There was simply not the labour force available to establish a reserve. As Allen was advancing, he estimated that he required 3,000 carriers to support his operations forward of Myola but in late October, there were only 1,250 forward of Myola and none to the rear. During the Australian advance, Myola 2 was developed as the major resupply point. A strip was developed there, being a larger area, but it was considered too risky for general use.\n\nAs Potts withdrew from Isurava, Myola was lost—his force destroying anything usable as it left. Successive withdrawals towards the start of the track eased the supply burden. As Allen advanced, following the withdrawing Japanese forces, he was acutely aware of the logistical problems facing his force. He faced pressure from Blamey and MacArthur to advance his forces without being able to assure their supply. His reluctance to do so was a significant factor leading to his replacement. McCarthy observes: \"There was little that General Vasey could add immediately to General Allen's planning.\"\n\nInitial Japanese reconnaissance had indicated a trafficable road to Kokoda. Bullard reports the error in this. While the road was improved for vehicle transport to Sonobo, about halfway from Gona to Wairopi, levies from Rabaul and pack-horses would have to carry supplies the remaining distance to Kokoda and further forward. Meanwhile, allied airpower interfered with the Japanese line-of-communication, particularly at the Kumusi River, making it uncrossable by day. Soldiers advanced from Kokoda carrying 16 days' rations. The advance, from the end of July until Ioribaiwa, in mid September was to last for over forty-five days. Their load included ammunition for the artillery and machine guns as well as of rice per man.\n\nA convoy carrying four independent supply companies destined to arrive at Buna on 20 September was delayed: \"The mechanism for maintaining supply for the South Seas Force was broken.\" By the time the Japanese had advanced to Ioribaiwa, there was extreme rationing and the daily rice ration had been reduced to per day without the prospect of captured stores alleviating the difficulty. Horii's force was unable to advance further. As the Japanese withdrew, it was found that many of the enemy had died of malnutrition with evidence that some Japanese had been reduced to eating wood, grass, roots and other inedible material. Australian soldiers were also confronted with evidence of cannibalism. Dead and wounded Australian and Japanese soldiers who had been left behind in the Australian retreat from Templeton's Crossing were stripped of flesh. In 1987, a Japanese documentary \"Yuki Yuki te Shingun\" contained interviews with Japanese soldiers who confessed to cannibalism in New Guinea. The evidence of cannibalism inflamed and angered the feelings of the Australians towards their adversaries.\n\nThe Japanese made little use of aerial resupply; an exception recorded is the drop of supplies at Kokoda on 23 September. When Australian forces reoccupied Kokoda, they found the strip there overgrown and unused.\n\nThe pre-war plantation economy of the Australian territories of Papua and New Guinea was based on a system of indentured labour. On 15 June 1942, Morris issued the Employment of Natives Order under the National Security (Emergency Control) Regulations. This provided for the conscription of Papuan labour to support the Australian war effort. While resupply of the Australian forces on the track would have collapsed without airdrops, the native carrier force remained an essential component, moving supplies forward from the drop zones under arduous conditions. Captain Geoffrey 'Doc' Vernon wrote of the conditions endured: \"The condition of our carriers at Eora Creek caused me more concern than that of the wounded ... Overwork, overloading ... exposure, cold and underfeeding were the common lot. Every evening scores of carriers came in, slung their loads down and lay exhausted on the ground.\"\n\nOn their return, they would carry back the wounded with care: for which they have been mythologised as the \"Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels\". There are many testaments of praise for the care rendered. In relation to the carriers, Captain (later Major) Henry Steward wrote after the war that \"the men on the stretchers ...[were] ... tended with the devotion of a mother and the care of a nurse\", while Frank Kingsley Norris recounted that, \"if night finds the stretcher still on the track, they will find a level spot and build a shelter over the patient. They will make him as comfortable as possible, fetch him water and feed him if food is available—regardless of their own needs. They sleep four each side of the stretcher and if the patient moves or requires any attention during the night, this is given instantly\".\n\nThe carrier force under command of Kienzle supporting the Australian advance is reported at over 1,600. The total number that worked on the track was significantly larger, with attrition through desertion and sickness. Author Paul Ham estimates a total of up to 3,000 and claims a desertion rate of 30 per cent. The ever-increasing need for labour impacted on the communities from which they were conscripted by reducing the capacity for food production.\n\nThe Japanese also relied on native labour to transport supplies for their forces on the Kokoda Track. Around 2,000 indentured workers were transported to the mainland from Rabaul, and a further 300 residents of the north coast of Papua were recruited. These labourers were poorly treated, and suffered from overwork. Many carriers who became sick or injured were murdered by Japanese forces. This mistreatment caused high desertion rates among the Papuan carriers. As the Japanese had difficulty obtaining replacement carriers, the casualties and desertions contributed to shortfalls in the quantities of supplies which reached the combat troops.\n\nWhen the 21st Brigade joined the fighting early in the campaign, the medical plan was for evacuation forward to Kokoda, and there, by air, on the premise that it would soon be recaptured. This was discarded as it quickly became apparent that this would not happen and any serious casualties were moved back toward Myola. Potts had requested air evacuation but this was refused for a lack of suitable aircraft.\n\nAs Myola was threatened by the Japanese advance, the casualties gathered there had to be evacuated to the head of the track. The report of then Colonel Norris, the 7th Division's senior medical officer, noted the difficulty of providing sufficient means to move stretchers. Each required eight bearers which meant those wounded who were able to stagger were treated with \"absolute ruthlessness\" and not provided with stretchers. In one case, a casualty with a severely fractured patella (kneecap) walked for six days and some with worse injuries volunteered to walk to free a stretcher for the more seriously wounded.\n\nAs the Australians advanced back along the track to Kokoda, Myola again became the main evacuation point. Aircraft were sent from Australia and approximately 40 patients were evacuated by air before a Ford Trimotor and a single-engined Stinson of unspecified model both crashed and further air evacuation from Myola was suspended.\n\nWith the recapture of Kokoda, air landings and evacuation could occur from its landing strip and it became the main point of evacuation. As well as C–47s landing with supplies, Stinson L-1 Vigilant light observation aircraft converted for use as air ambulances, flew into Kokoda. At the start of November, the detachment at Myola was caring for 438 sick and wounded. Many walked back along the track as they became sufficiently well to make the trek. Some had to wait up to two-and-a-half months before porters were available to carry the stretcher cases forward to Kokoda for evacuation by air. The last arrived at Port Moresby only a couple of days before Christmas. Norris later wrote and questioned: \"why after three years of war no adequate ambulance planes were available\"?\n\nBullard reports that, while the munitions of the 144th Regiment were limited by what they could carry, this included eighteen [medium] machine guns (Type 92 Juki), three battalion (infantry) guns, two rapid-fire guns and two regimental artillery guns. The mountain artillery battalion deployed with three companies servicing a gun each, while leaving one gun in reserve at Buna. The 44th Regiment deployed with thirteen medium machine guns, three battalion guns, one regimental gun and one rapid-fire gun. Anderson indicates that the regimental and mountain artillery battalion guns were of the 75 mm Type 41, while the infantry guns were of the 70 mm Type 92. By virtue that the 37 mm guns were described as \"rapid fire\", these were most likely the dual-purpose Type 94 anti-tank gun which was a rapid-fire gun, as distinct from the earlier Type 11 37 mm infantry gun. It employed an automatic cartridge ejection and was capable of firing up to 30 rounds per minute. Primarily a direct-fire weapon, using telescopic sights, it had an effective range of and could be broken down into four loads of . The Type 92 battalion gun was a 70 mm light howitzer capable of direct and indirect fire. It had an effective range of , firing a high-explosive projectile of . The Type 41 was a mountain gun capable of firing a high-explosive projectile to a maximum range of . It could be broken down into eleven units of not more than .\n\nThe Australian brigade structure included a regiment of artillery, consisting of two batteries, each equipped with twelve Ordnance QF 25-pounder guns. These had a range of but weighed and were not intended to be broken down into pack loads. As the Japanese advance threatened Imita Ridge the 14th Field Regiment (less one battery) deployed to near the head of the track to defend against a break-out by the Japanese into more open country. Two guns were hauled to Owers' Corner by caterpillar tractor. On 20 September, they shelled the Japanese positions at Ioribaiwa from a range of . A third gun was stripped down and man-handled forward, taking 50 men five days to move it just through the mountainous jungle terrain. However, by time they were in position and ready to fire the Japanese were out of range.\n\nIn response to the situation, the 1st Mountain Battery was raised and equipped with 3.7-inch pack howitzers hastily obtained from the Royal New Zealand Navy. Initially it was intended that the guns would be moved by pack horse; however, following the unit's arrival in Port Moresby in early October it soon became clear that horses would be unsuited to the humid conditions in New Guinea with the guns to be moved by jeeps and native carriers instead. It took about 90 porters to move one gun without ammunition. The battery did not take part in the fighting along the track but on 15 November, a detachment with one gun was flown into Kokoda to support the Australian 7th Division.\n\nAn Australian infantry battalion had a mortar platoon with four Ordnance ML 3-inch mortars, capable of throwing a round . Battalions also had access to the Vickers medium machine gun. The Vickers, while water cooled, was of similar weight and capability to the Juki employed by the Japanese. When Australian forces deployed forward, neither of these weapons were carried. It was considered that they were too heavy to be carried and that they could not be effectively employed in jungle terrain.\n\nA post action report by the 2/14th Battalion identified that it was a mistake not to take these weapons forward. By the time of the Battle of Brigade Hill–Mission Ridge (from about 6 September), the 21st Brigade was operating a section of three 3-inch mortars that had been parachuted into Myola. When the Australians commenced the advance from Imita Ridge, most battalions moving forward carried a 3-inch mortar with twenty-four bombs and one Vickers machine gun with 3,000 rounds.\n\nDespite this increased fire-power, the Japanese still held a significant advantage by quantity and range. McCarthy recounts instances where Australian mortars and Vickers machine guns brought into service were quickly targeted and taken out by Japanese artillery. There was also a high rate of misfires with mortar ammunition that had been airdropped and, after such a round exploded in the barrel and killed the crew, the use of airdropped mortar ammunition was suspended by the 16th Brigade.\n\nThe Japanese carried into the mountains thirteen artillery pieces and employed fifteen in the Battle of Oivi–Gorari at the end of the campaign. While Anderson reports that approximately 940 men were responsible for carrying the guns, ammunition and other paraphernalia across the Owen Stanleys, he concludes that, despite this burden: \"Throughout the Kokoda campaign the Japanese held one distinct advantage over the Australians: artillery. The Japanese use of artillery pieces in each Kokoda battle was a force multiplier, and the Australians were never able to match the Japanese ranged weapons.\" He attributes around 35 per cent of the Australian casualties to the Japanese artillery but observes that the effect upon morale was perhaps of equal significance: \"The helplessness felt by the men who were subjected to relentless bombardment without the means to retaliate sapped both their number and their spirit.\" Williams asserts that: \"Japanese artillery provided an important, perhaps decisive, role on the battlefields of the Kokoda Track.\"\n\nAustralian soldiers initially entered battle wearing a khaki uniform which contrasted with the darker greens of the jungle. Moreover, webbing of the 21st Brigade had been bleached white from their service in Syria. In contrast, the Japanese wore a green uniform more suited to the jungle environment and were adept at camouflage. By the time the 25th Brigade was committed to the fighting, it was wearing jungle green—albeit that these were khaki uniforms that had been quickly dyed. This dye ran and caused skin complaints among the wearers.\n\nMuch of the Australian equipment was standardised across the British army and the Commonwealth. This imperial legacy meant a force structure intended for fighting in open country and which was highly reliant on motor transport. Consequently, weight was not so much a consideration where equipment was not intended to be man-packed. The 109 radio set and associated equipment required nineteen carriers to transport, were temperamental as a result of the \"excessive handling\" and were susceptible to moisture and humidity. In contrast, the Japanese used compact wireless sets and lightweight aluminium signal wire.\n\nCaptured stocks of Mills bombs (model 36M) were valued by the Japanese. The lever and striker mechanism of the Mills bomb was considered superior to their own service grenade, the Type 99, which had to be struck on a hard object to ignite the fuze immediately before throwing.\n\nApart from the significant logistical contribution in support of the Australian forces, air operations included bombing missions against Rabaul, the Japanese base supporting the landings in Papua, and the attempts to resupply and reinforce the beachheads around Buna and Gona. Bombers were based in Australia, staging through Port Moresby—resulting in considerable crew fatigue.\n\nBombing sorties also targeted the beachheads, particularly the airfield being constructed at Buna, and the Japanese line of communication. Regular missions against Buna effectively neutralised the airfield—damaging it almost as fast as it could be repaired, thereby rendering it ineffective. The crossing of the Kumusi at Wairopi was regularly targeted and bridging works repeatedly destroyed. The Australian forces on the track called for bombing and strafing missions in support of operations on several occasions but such requests were not always fulfilled. Weather conditions across the range constantly interfered with operations.\n\nMacArthur, after being ordered to leave the Philippines, arrived in Australia on 17 March 1942 and was appointed Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA). MacArthur had to compete with Admiral Chester Nimitz's plan to drive towards Japan through the central Pacific. Ambitious, he was concerned that his command should not be sidelined. Blamey had been recalled from the Middle East, arriving in Australia on 23 March 1942. Shortly after, he was appointed as commander-in-chief of the Australian Army and subsequently, to the separate position, which he simultaneously held, of commander, allied land forces SWPA.\n\nPapua and New Guinea had been the Australian 8th Military District under command of Morris. On 9 April 1942, it was formed into New Guinea Force, with Morris promoted major general. As events escalated and the forces involved increased, Rowell arrived from Australia with HQ I Corps, taking command of the force on 12 August 1942. Morris was moved to command the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit (ANGAU). At about this time, 7th Division was deploying to New Guinea and responsibility for the immediate defence of Port Moresby, including Maroubra Force and the Kokoda Track operation was devolved to divisional headquarters under Allan.\n\nBoth Blamey's Allied Land Headquarters (LHQ) and MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) were increasingly alarmed by the situation on the track, with Australian forces suffering a series of reversals, and by the Japanese landings at Milne Bay (this battle was fought from 25 August to 7 September 1942). Vasey, then Blamey's deputy chief of the general staff, wrote privately to Rowell on 1 September, that \"GHQ is like a bloody barometer in a cyclone—up and down every two minutes\". MacArthur also had a poor opinion of the Australian troops and no real appreciation of the conditions under which the fighting in New Guinea was being conducted. On 6 September, MacArthur wrote to General George Marshall that, \"the Australians have proven themselves unable to match the enemy in jungle fighting. Aggressive leadership is lacking.\" Jones observes, \"The attitude that the Australians were poor fighters pervaded thinking at MacArthur's headquarters\".\n\nThe Australian government was also concerned. On 9 September, Army Minister Frank Forde directed Blamey to visit Port Moresby, which he did, from 12 to 14 September. On his return, he was able to assure the government of his confidence in Rowell and that the situation was in hand. Nonetheless, MacArthur persuaded the Australian Prime Minister, John Curtin, to send Blamey to New Guinea to take command there and \"energise the situation\". By this manoeuvre, MacArthur ensured that Blamey would be the scapegoat if Port Moresby fell.\n\nMacArthur visited Port Moresby briefly from 2 October. On 3 October, he went as far forward as Owers' Corner, where he spent about an hour. He was present as the 16th Brigade, under Brigadier John Lloyd, was commencing its advance along the track. He subsequently established his advance headquarters in Port Moresby on 6 November 1942 (just after Kokoda was reoccupied) until January 1943.\n\nThe \"command crisis\" is referred to by McCarthy (among others) in the Australian official history as part of a chapter title: \"Ioriabiawa: and a command in crisis\". Academic and historian, David Horner's first book is titled, \"Crisis of Command: Australian Generalship and the Japanese Threat, 1941–1943\", in which he studies the generalship in these early stages of the war with Japan. Anderson notes that, while the \"command crisis\" specifically relates to Blamey's sacking of Rowell, the phrase can also be applied to the sackings of Allen and Potts.\n\nComplying with Curtin's directive, albeit reluctantly, Blamey arrived in Port Moresby on 23 September 1942 with only a small personal staff. It was a situation which Blamey felt was quite reasonable but with which Rowell saw significant difficulties. Rowell's objections were that the circumstances of Blamey's presence in his headquarters would ultimately undermine the good conduct of its operation by forcing it to serve two masters. McCarthy's reporting of the initial situation suggests that Blamey, while maintaining his position, was conciliatory and empathetic toward Rowell's concerns. Allen recounts that Rowell's objection was not to Blamey using his headquarters as much as the expectation that he (Rowell) was expected to be Blamey's chief-of-staff. Horner observes that this was much how the headquarters subsequently operated under Herring. Underpinning the events that followed was bad blood between them stemming from Blamey's conduct in the Middle East and Greece. Perhaps, more importantly, there was a sense of disappointment in Blamey's lack of support by way of resolve to oppose the decision to send Blamey to New Guinea. In at letter to Major General Cyril Clowes at Milne Bay, Rowell said on this, \"Either I am fit to command the show or I am not.\"\n\nWhile the situation continued to simmer, it came to a head after Blamey had visited Milne Bay on 25 September at MacArthur's suggestion and ordered Clowes to send a force by air to Wanigela. Major General George Kenney noted that Rowell was \"not even consulted anymore\". Rowell confronted Blamey on the issue and was relieved of command on 28 September. In a communication to Curtin, Blamey referred to Rowell as insubordinate and obstructive. Rowell was replaced by Lieutenant General Edmund Herring.\n\nOn 9 September 1942, Allen's command responsibilities were narrowed to the direct prosecution of the Kokoda Track campaign and flank protection. Important to subsequent events, NGF retained control of aerial resupply. The Australian advance commenced with the attack of 28 September against the (abandoned) Japanese positions on Ioribaiwa Ridge. The 16th Brigade commenced to advance forward on 3 October.\n\nAllen had advanced his headquarters to Menari by 11 October. The 25th Brigade was advancing on two tracks from Efogi, toward Templeton's Crossing. He was mindful of the need to keep his troops fresh enough to fight and of the supply problems imposed by operations over the track. There were already difficulties in air drops meeting the division's needs. These concerns were expressed to Herring on 7 October, including the need to create a reserve over and above the daily needs. As a consequence, the supply programme intensified.\n\nOn 5 October, Blamey wrote to MacArthur in \"hard terms\" of the logistical difficulties faced by NGF and specifically, Allen. Despite this, Blamey and MacArthur pressured Allen to increase his rate of advance and Blamey forced the issue by only arranging for supplies to be dropped at Myola—effectively forcing Allen to advance to meet his point of supply. Anderson discusses this and identifies it as an \"extremely risky\" strategy. Blamey (and Herring) wanted Allen to maintain pressure on the retreating Japanese and push home the advantage. Dropping supplies forward maintains the momentum of advance but this quickly breaks down if the advance is stalled and there are limited reserves. The position of Blamey was premised on the proposition that the Japanese were an enemy in retreat. In fact, they had made a clean break from Ioriabiawa and had established defences that were blocking Allen's advance on both routes to Templeton's Crossing. With supplies dropped at Myola, Allen could not easily support the advance being made along the Mount Bellamy track and, until the position forward of Templeton' Crossing was secured, there was the risk of Myola being compromised.\n\nOn 17 October, Allen, now at Myola, received the following message from Blamey:\nAllen's response was measured. He requested that any decision on his progress be deferred until a report could be made by a liaison officer or more senior officer. MacArthur and Blamey continued to press Allen through the delays experienced at Templeton's Crossing and Eora Village. To his credit, Allen stood by his subordinates. Just as the 16th Brigade was advancing on Eora Village, a signal from MacArthur through Blamey on 21 October further pressured Allen: \"Operations reports show that progress on the trail is NOT repeat NOT satisfactory. The tactical handling of our troops in my opinion is faulty.\" Allen replied, in part: \"I have complete confidence in my brigade commanders and troops and feel that they could not have done better.\" Allen's trust may have been misplaced though, as Anderson describes Lloyd as having \"botched\" the tactical handling of the first two days of the engagement at Eora Village that were just then unfolding. He also notes that the downward pressure being applied for haste likely weighed heavily in Lloyd's decision to proceed initially with a frontal attack. The pressure for more haste thereby contributed to increasing the delays. On 28 October, Blamey ordered Allen's recall and replacement by Vasey. Allen had vouched for the judgement and professionalism of his brigade commanders (in this case, specifically Lloyd) and in this, he was ultimately responsible; however, Anderson opines that Allen's replacement may have been inevitable, regardless of the justification.\n\nPotts had been sent forward to Isurava with orders to attack and recapture Kokoda. Instead, his force was unable to withstand the Japanese attacks and he was forced to conduct a fighting withdrawal, suffering a disastrous defeat at Brigade Hill. Increasingly concerned, MacArthur applied pressure to the chain-of-command. Potts was recalled to Port Moresby by Rowell on 10 September, with Porter as his replacement. Horner reports Rowell's motive as dissatisfaction with Potts' \"mishandling\" of his brigade and a need to obtain a first-hand account of conditions. Anderson reports Allen agreed with the decision, judging that Potts was \"either tired or losing a grip of the situation\". On arriving at Port Moresby, Potts was interviewed by Rowell and Allen, whereupon, satisfied with his performance, he was returned to command his brigade.\n\nHowever, in a private interview (overheard by Potts' staff captain, Ken Murdoch) on 22 October, the day of the \"running rabbit\" address, Blamey told Potts he was no longer required in New Guinea: \"Failures like the Kokoda Trail ... could not be tolerated—the men had shown that something was lacking ..[and he] blamed the leaders.\" Potts was transferred to command the 23rd Brigade reforming in Darwin, exchanging postings with Brigadier Ivan Dougherty. Herring has claimed that the decision was his—feeling that Potts needed to be rested and wanting Dougherty to take the position. Murdoch was inundated with resignation papers from officers affronted by Potts' treatment. Potts instructed Murdoch to reject all resignations.\n\nOn 22 October, after the relief of the 21st Brigade by the 25th Brigade, Blamey visited Koitaki, near Port Moresby, where the 21st Brigade was encamped. Shortly after relieving Potts, Blamey addressed the men of the 21st Brigade on a parade ground. The men of the Maroubra Force expected congratulations for their efforts in holding back the Japanese. Instead of praising them, Blamey told the brigade that they had been \"beaten\" by inferior forces, and that \"no soldier should be afraid to die\". \"Remember,\" Blamey was reported as saying, \"it's the rabbit who runs who gets shot, not the man holding the gun.\" There was a wave of murmurs and restlessness among the soldiers. Officers and senior non-commissioned officers (NCOs) managed to quiet the soldiers and many later said that Blamey was lucky to escape with his life. During the march-past, many disobeyed the \"eyes right\" order. In a later letter to his wife, an enraged Brigadier Potts swore to \"fry his [Blamey's] soul in the afterlife\" over this incident. According to witnesses, when Blamey subsequently visited Australian wounded in the camp hospital, inmates nibbled lettuce, while wrinkling their noses and whispering \"run, rabbit, run\" (the chorus of a popular song during the war).\n\nHistorian Peter Dean acknowledges the general interpretation that the actions of MacArthur and Blamey were \"to salvage their own positions at the expense of the troops\" but reports that MacArthur, himself, was under pressure, citing a cable from the US Joint Chiefs to MacArthur of 16 October, \"reminding him that they viewed the situation in Papua as 'critical. Dean also notes that this coincided with the relief of Vice Admiral Robert Ghormley, Commander-in-Chief of US forces in the south Pacific who had operational control of the forces engaged at Guadalcanal. The pressure brought to bear by MacArthur was in the face of \"complicated operational and strategic contexts\", stating that, \"an understanding of these contexts has been poorly done in most accounts of the fighting [in Papua].\" This is encapsulated in correspondence from Brigadier General Stephen J. Chamberlin (MacArthur's operations chief) to MacArthur's Chief-of-Staff, Richard K. Sutherland, of 30 October 1942: \"the key to our plan of action lies in the success or failure of the South Pacific in holding Guadalcanal ...\" (that is, that the position at Guadalcanal was tenuous).\n\nHowever, with specific reference to Allen, Horner finds, \"MacArthur showed an abysmal lack of trust in his subordinate [Blamey and his view that Allen was doing all he could], and an unwarranted interference in the tactical handling of troops some 1,500 miles from his headquarters.\" While the Curtin government was largely steadfast in recalling the 2nd AIF from the Middle East to Australia against considerable opposition from Churchill, Horner observes the government's complete dependence on MacArthur, which compromised Blamey's relationship with it. His analysis also observes that these events were underpinned by the logistical problems faced by the NGF on the track and elsewhere.\n\nHorner's criticism of Blamey in sacking Allen is that he was in no position to accurately assess Allen's performance, observing that if Vasey could be flown into Myola to relieve Allen, then an assessment could have been arranged using the same means. Blamey acted to placate MacArthur because he (Blamey) was unwilling to risk his own job. Blamey had demonstrated \"a remarkable lack of loyalty\" toward his subordinate. To some degree, Herring shares in this criticism. Williams, however, observes that Allen's advance was nonetheless slower than might reasonably have been expected and that the criticisms leveled at him and leading to his sacking were reasonably justified.\n\nHorner observes of Rowell, that his only failure was an inability to work with Blamey and that Blamey was more culpable in that, he was unwilling to risk his own position. He should have shown more trust and loyalty toward his subordinate; negated MacArthur's manoeuvring and avoided the situation.\n\nRegardless of the justifications made, the sackings created a climate of suspicion, animosity, personal rivalries and a \"toxic atmosphere\" which pervaded the senior ranks and was detrimental to the war effort. Horner observes that Blamey trod a precarious line between \"maintaining his own position and protecting the Australian commanders, between risking his own replacement and risking the distrust of his subordinates\". Horner notes, \"the arguments between generals and politicians might seem of little consequence. But the opposite is the case. It was errors by men like MacArthur and Blamey which lead to the near disaster in New Guinea. As usual, it was the men in the front line who paid the heaviest price.\"\n\nThe Japanese landings at Gona commenced at about 5:30 pm on 21 July 1942. They were opposed by Allied air attacks until darkness fell and again in the morning, for the loss of one transport ship. The Japanese landings were observed by patrols of the PIB and officers of the ANGAU. Templeton brought forward two of his platoons. His remaining platoon was to protect Kokoda. First contact was made at about 4.00 pm on 23 July. A PIB patrol led by Lieutenant Chalk ambushed advancing Japanese near Awala. The bridge across the Kumusi River at Wairopi was destroyed by the withdrawing Australians and the Japanese were harassed as they made a crossing.\n\nOwen had flown to Kokoda on 24 July and went forward with Templeton to assess the situation. Owen then returned to Kokoda and called for reinforcements to be landed. An ambush position was sited about east of Gorari and sprung at about midday on 25 July. The force of two platoons and the remaining PIB then withdrew to Oivi, taking up a position that evening. D Company's 16 Platoon arrived by air at Kokoda in two flights on 26 July. The first flight arrived at 10:00 am. They were immediately sent forward and had joined the force at Oivi before the Japanese attack at 3:00 pm. The force was able to hold the Japanese for a time, before being forced to retire on a secondary position. With the Japanese trying to encircle this position, Templeton was concerned for the second flight yet to arrive and set out to warn it. There was a burst of fire shortly after he left. Templeton was never seen again.\n\nWatson took command. As the force was increasingly threatened by encirclement, it broke toward Deniki. At Kokoda, Owen had lost contact with his forward platoons and also withdrew to Deniki, departing at 11:00 am on 27 July. On the following morning, a small party of stragglers arrived. Having spent the previous night at Kokoda, they reported the village unoccupied. Leaving two sections at Deniki, Owen quickly advanced back to the village.\n\nBy 11:30 am, Owen had reoccupied Kokoda with a force consisting of B Company, the remaining PIB and members of the ANGAU that had joined Maroubra Force, variously numbered at between 80 and 148. Owen called for reinforcements and shortly after, two planes appeared overhead but did not land as the defenders were slow in removing the barricades that had been placed across the airstrip and the pilots believed the situation too risky to land. There are inconsistencies in the various accounts of this event—most significantly, whether this occurred on 28 July or the day earlier, when Owen was about to abandon Kokoda.\n\nThe Kokoda plateau is tongue shaped, with steep-sloped sides. The government station is located at its northern tip. The track from Oivi approaches the tip from the east. The track to Deniki runs down its centre to the south. Owen positioned his force around the station at its tip. At 1:30 pm, advance elements of the Japanese force that was to total approximately 200 were sighted. As the Japanese commander, Captain Ogawa, assembled his force, the Australian defenders were harassed through the night, including fire from light mortars and a Type 92 battalion gun, which was particularly telling as the Australians had no means to respond to it. The main attack commenced at 2:30 in the early morning of 29 July. Owen was in the forward positions to inspire his troops and received a mortal gunshot wound above his right eye. Watson assumed command and, as the force was being overrun, withdrew to Deniki.\n\nFollowing the first battle at Kokoda, there was a brief pause in fighting during which both the Japanese and the Australians concentrated their forces for the next phase. For the Japanese, this was the 1st Battalion of the 144th Infantry Regiment, of which the 1st Company had faced B Company at Kokoda. The battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Tsukamoto Hatsuo. C Company and A Company of the 39th Battalion arrived at Deniki on 30 and 31 July respectively. Major Allan Cameron, Brigade Major of the 30th Brigade, had been sent forward to take command of Maroubra Force, arriving on 4 August. Cameron formed a low opinion of B Company after encountering troops moving southward along the track as he moved forward. Cameron's arrival coincided with a telephone line being established from the head of the track to Deniki. This greatly improved communications with Port Moresby. D Company arrived on 6 August. With this force, Cameron resolved to counterattack and recapture Kokoda. His plan was to advance along three routes assigned to each of his fresh companies with B Company securing Deniki. C Company was to advance along the main track to Kokoda. A Company, under Captain Noel Symington, was to advance along a parallel track to the east that was unknown to the Japanese. D Company was to advance on a track from Deniki to Pirivi. Pirivi was just south of the Oivi–Kokoda track and about east of Kokoda. There, it was to take up a blocking position.\n\nFinal orders were issued by Cameron on the afternoon of 7 August, for an advance the following morning to the form-up points and an attack at noon. Cameron's force totaled 550 with the three attacking companies numbering 430. This was opposed by 522 men of 1/144 Battalion and a total force of 660, including an artillery platoon and combat engineers. Tsukamoto also chose to attack toward Deniki the same day along the main track and C Company encountered resistance, having advanced only .\n\nThe attack on Kokoda was preceded with bombing and strafing by sixteen P–39s. Symington was able to advance into Kokoda and, meeting minimal resistance, was able to occupy it. A message was sent with Corporal Sanopa to Cameron requiring resupply by air and reinforcements to hold the village. C Company advancing on the main track, met increasing resistance as it came upon Tsukamoto's main force. Unable to advance further, it withdrew to Deniki, with the Japanese closely following. It arrived there at 5:50 pm. As D Company, under Captain Max Bidstrup took up a position at the junction on the Oivi–Kokoda track, it came under strong attack by engineers from both directions. Judging the attack on Kokoda had been unsuccessful he withdrew at 4:30 pm back to Deniki with his main force, arriving at about 1:30 pm on 9 August (with 17 Platoon, that had become isolated in the fighting, arriving the next day).\n\nSanopa arrived with Symington's message in the morning of 9 August. Cameron requested both an air drop of supplies and aerial reconnaissance to ascertain the situation at Kokoda. He was informed that resupply could not occur until the following day. Tsukamoto had sent a company back to Kokoda, arriving at 11:30 am on 9 August. Without resupply and facing determined attacks Symington's force held until 7:00 pm on 10 August. It then withdrew westwards by a circuitous route back to Isurava, arriving on 13 August. The reconnaissance flight occurred in the morning of 10 August but the promised resupply was delayed by weather until 12 August when it was dropped into the hands of the Japanese.\n\nThe Machine Gun Company of the 39th Battalion had deployed along the track (less its medium machine guns) and had been holding a position at Isurava for about a week. Cameron called it forward, arriving in Deniki at 5:00 pm on 12 August, it exchanged roles with B Company. Patrols from Deniki had reported the Japanese advancing \"en masse\" from Kokoda. Their attack commenced 5:30 am on 13 August and continued throughout the day. Sporadic gunfire continued through most of the night and the attack was renewed the next morning. As the Japanese threatened his flanks and rear, Cameron ordered the withdrawal to Isurava at 9:50 am.\n\nTsukamoto did not continue to press the advance but waited for Horii to concentrate his main force, estimating that the Australian force holding Kokoda had numbered around 1,000, to 1,200. The force available to Horii was based on five infantry battalions with supporting arms and services variously reported at 3,000 and 5,000 strong. Horii planned to attack with four infantry battalions, holding one of these in immediate reserve to exploit the result. The force that engaged the Australians at Isurava totaled 2,130, including artillery.\n\nOn 16 August, Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Honner arrived at Isurava to take command of the 39th Battalion. He also assumed command of Maroubra Force which, by then, included the first company of the 53rd Battalion to arrive at Alola, approximately south of Isurava. Command passed to Porter when he arrived with headquarters of the 30th Brigade on 19 August. Potts, with two battalions of the 21st Brigade was also moving forward but their advance was delayed at a \"critical time\" due to insufficient supplies at Myola. Potts assumed command of the combined force on 23 August, with orders to attack toward Kokoda and the intention of relieving the 39th Battalion in order to alleviate his supply difficulties. The Australian force he commanded amounted to 2,290.\nThe position at Isurava occupied by the 39th Battalion was bounded front and rear by small creeks that ran into the gorge-like Eora Creek to the west; with a steep spur-line rising to the west. Main ridges, bounding Eora Creek ran north–south. The Isurava position and main track were on the \"Isurava ridge\" or western side of Eora Creek. A parallel track ran along the side of the \"Abuari ridge\" or western side of Eora Creek. Honner later recounted that it was: \"as good a delaying position as could be found on the main track.\" The position was, however, overlooked by a spur-line to the north (referred to in the sources as a ridge), which afforded the Japanese a position from which they could fire down on the Australian position. The main force of the 53rd Battalion was located at Alola but tasked with security of the Abuari track on the western flank.\n\nForward positions and patrols on both tracks had been contacted on 26 August. The 39th Battalion positions came under artillery fire as the 2/14th Battalion was moving to occupy them. The 39th Battalion then took-up a position to their immediate rear. The 53rd Battalion was responsible for protecting the eastern flank and approach along the Abuari ridge. Through the 26 and 27 August, the position there became increasingly uncertain. Forward companies of the 53rd Battalion failed to act decisively, the command party of the battalion, moving forward to take direct command was ambushed, leaving Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Ward dead. The 2/16th Battalion was called up from near Myola to shore up the position on the eastern flank.\n\nFrom the 27 August, the Japanese attacks increased in intensity along both approaches. On the Abuari track, reinforcement by two companies of the 2/16th Battalion was able to stay the advance of the 2/144th Battalion on this axis. Japanese sources later noted that the defence by the 53rd and 2/16th on the right offered them \"little opportunity to make a speedy exploitation\", although, the Japanese commander has been criticised for not pressing his advantage there, apparently under the belief that it was more strongly held.\n\nOn the approach to Isurava, the 2/14th and 39th Battalions came under increasing pressure from Japanese attacks, culminating in hand-to-hand fighting in which Private Bruce Kingsbury was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. Eyewitnesses said that Kingsbury's actions had a profound effect on the Japanese, temporarily halting their momentum. His citation read, in part:\n\nPrivate Kingsbury, who was one of the few survivors of a platoon which had been overrun ... immediately volunteered to join a different platoon which had been ordered to counterattack. He rushed forward, firing the Bren gun from his hip through terrific machine-gun fire, and succeeded in clearing a path through the enemy. Continuing to sweep enemy positions with his fire, and inflicting an extremely high number of casualties upon them, Private Kingsbury was then seen to fall to the ground, shot dead by the bullet from a sniper hiding in the wood.\nThrough this time, the Japanese were able to bring telling fire upon the Isurava position. Most accounts report this came from machine guns, [medium or heavy] mortars and artillery pieces. The account in Williams suggests that the mortars have been misidentified—attributing this instead to artillery alone. Williams reports eight artillery guns: with six artillery guns and machine gun fire falling on the rest house (later). The other two were dispersed in support of the 2/144th east of the gorge and the 1/144th in close support. The Australians were only able to reply with a single 3-inch medium mortar of the 39th Battalion that arrived on 27 August, having been brought up by the 2/14th after being airdropped at Myola.\n\nWith the western flank threatened, the Australian force at Isurava withdrew to a position at the Isurava resthouse (between Isurava and Alola) during the late hours of 29 August. On 30 August, the 3/144th attacked from the western flank and cut the route rearward to Alola. The attack was preceded by intense fire from the Japanese mountain artillery. At 3:00 pm, Potts order a withdrawal to Eora Village. Many members of Maroubra Force became separated including Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Key, who was subsequently captured and killed. In his post-operation report, Potts noted: \"At no time were 2/14th and 2/16th Australian infantry battalions ever intact and available for a concerted operation, wholly and solely due to the delays occasioned by supply.\"\n\nDisengaging from the battle at Isurava, Potts was compelled by the pursuing Japanese to conduct a fighting withdrawal. As the situation at Milne Bay stabilised, Allen released the 2/27th Battalion to join the rest of the 21st Brigade. Departing along the track on 30 August, it would take several days to reach the front and have no impact on this stage of the campaign. During the battle Horii decided to commit the 2/41st, under Major Mitsuo Koiwai, with the aim of conducting a wide arc to the west and emerging on the track to the south of Alola. They became lost, and in fact did not regain contact with the main Japanese force until after the battle, without firing a single shot. Horii now assigned the battalion to the vanguard to pursue the withdrawing Maroubra Force.\n\nIn the initial withdrawal, the 2/16th Battalion had a screening role, withdrawing by stages from the rear of Alola toward Eora Village, while the village itself was held by what remained of the 39th Battalion. As most of Maroubra Force had withdrawn through their positions, the 2/16th Battalion then retired on Eora Village, arriving about midday 1 September. It then took up a defensive position on a bald spur on the southern side of the creek that overlooked the crossing and village. The 2/14th Battalion was about south along the track. The 39th Battalion, by then numbering less than 150, was ordered to proceed to Kagi and hold there. It remained forward until it was withdrawn on 5 September. On the morning of 31 August, the 53rd Battalion was sent out of battle and ordered to return to Myola, where part of the battalion remained, providing work parties.\n\nCommencing with Eora Village, the 2/16th Battalion occupied delaying positions along the track: withdrawing from Eora Village at 6:00 am on 2 September; to a position forward of Templeton's Crossing until dusk of 2 September; and, a position overlooking Dump 1 (on Eora Creek about south of Templeton's crossing), until the night of 4 September. At each stage, the 2/14th Battalion screened the withdrawal of the 2/16th Battalion.\n\nPotts was, with this final engagement, able to make a clean break from the Japanese advance but only with the loss of Myola—the terrain afforded the Japanese too great an advantage and it could be bypassed, using the original track to the west. Potts abandoned Myola, destroying what supplies could not be carried out. It has been credited as a successful rearguard action for the Australians.\n\nUnder mounting pressure from Allen and Rowell to make a stand, Potts determined to do so at Mission Ridge, which ran northward from Brigade Hill toward the village of Efogi. Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Cooper, commanding the 2/27th Battalion had reached as far as Kagi with the leading companies on 4 September. Cooper then concentrated his battalion in position just south of Efogi, where he could screen the brigade before he was recalled back to the position of the main force during the afternoon of 6 September. The 2/27th occupied a forward position astride the track. The 2/14th Battalion was to its immediate rear and slightly to the east. Brigade headquarters was approximately to the rear. The main force of the 2/16 Battalion was between brigade headquarters and the forward battalions, while its D Company was located with brigade headquarters as rear protection.\n\nHorii had become dissatisfied with the rate of advance made with the 41st Regiment in the vanguard and replaced it with 144th Regiment from 5 September. Colonel Kusonose Masao employed his 2nd and 3rd Battalions in the attack. As the Japanese moved into position through the night of 6 September, Australians observed lights which Anderson describes as a \"lantern parade\". An airstrike was called for the following morning with eight B–26 Marauders and four P–40s as escorts, bombing and strafing. Anderson reports that it had a greater effect on the morale; positive and negative of the Australians and Japanese respectively, than it did in causing casualties.\n\nDuring 7 September, the 3/144th Battalion probed toward the position of the 2/27th Battalion, with Japanese artillery and machine guns firing upon the forward Australian battalions. The 21st Brigade was only able to direct fire from a section of three mortars under command of the brigade. At 5:00 pm, the brigade war diary reports the 2/27th Battalion being \"hammered by mortars, QF gun and HMG\".\n\nDuring the night, the 2/144th Battalion conducted an undetected enveloping move to the west and attacked up the ridge just before dawn to join the track between brigade headquarters and the forward battalions. At much the same time, the 3/144th Battalion launched an intense attack against the 2/27th Battalion. In the fighting that developed, the 2/27th Battalion drew back on the 2/14th Battalion's position while the 2/16th and 2/14th Battalions counterattacked south. Brigade headquarters (and D Company of the 2/16th Battalion) also attacked north to try to dislodge the incursion of the Japanese 2/144th Battalion without success.\n\nImmediately before communication forward broke down, Potts passed command of the brigade group to Caro. As the situation deteriorated, the headquarters group withdrew to Nauro. The 2/14th and 2/16th Battalions broke track to the east and were able to rejoin the brigade. The 2/27th Battalion, however, were unable to follow and were considered effectively lost until they emerged from the jungle three weeks later. The battle at Brigade Hill – Mission Ridge has been described as a \"stunning victory\" for the Japanese and a \"catastrophe\" for the Australians.\n\nEven before the battle at Mission Ridge had concluded, Rowell had issued orders recalling Potts to Port Moresby. What remained of the 2/14th and 2/16th Battalions rejoined the 21st Brigade and withdrew southwards towards Ioribaiwa and harassed the Japanese advance. Porter, having orders to stabilise the position, took command of Maroubra Force on 10 September. By this time, the 2/14th and 2/16th Battalion were so reduced in strength that they were formed into a combined force fielding a company strength from each. It was reinforced by the 3rd Battalion and by the 2/1st Pioneer Battalion, although the latter did not move forward. The 25th Brigade under Eather was being sent forward to relieve the situation. As he prepared to attack, Eather assumed command of Maroubra Force.\n\nPorter had positioned the composite battalion astride the track on the Ioribaiwa ridgeline, running from the main range to the northwest. The track followed a spur-line falling north toward Ofi Creek. The 3rd Battalion was positioned on the ridge to its immediate right on the eastern side of the track. It was the major ridgeline before Imita Ridge and the head of the track. Eather planned to attack, advancing past Porters' flanks with two of his battalions—the 2/31st Battalion on the western flank and the 2/33rd Battalion on the eastern flank. The 2/25th Battalion was his reserve. It took up a position on the track behind Porter's force. On the night 13–14 September, the 25th Brigade bivouacked to the rear of Porter's force ready to advance. As Eather's battalions were deploying, the Japanese attacked. Eather immediately called off the attack and adopted a defensive posture. This had the effect of placing his advancing battalions on either flank and significantly increasing his frontage.\n\nFrom Brigade Hill, Kusonose had continued to pursue the Australians with the 2nd/144th and 3rd/144th Battalions. Horii had halted his main force awaiting permission to continue the advance. Kusonose's initial attack was made with half of the 3rd/144th Battalion advancing along the axis of the track, while the 2nd/144th Battalion was to make a flanking attack from the west. Kusonose was able to bring fire on the Australian positions from eight guns. Fighting continued through the day but both attacks had been held. An attack on 15 September was made by his reserve, the second half of the 3rd/144th Battalion against what he thought was the eastern flank of the Australian force. Unaware that Maroubra Force had been reinforced, this lodged in a gap between the Australian 3rd Battalion and the 2/33rd Battalion. Counter attacks by two companies of the 2/25th and two companies of the 2/33rd Battalion that day were unable to dislodge the Japanese from this foothold.\n\nFighting on 16 September continued much as it had on the previous day, although the Japanese lodged between the 3rd Battalion and the 2/33rd Battalion took to the high-ground—\"Sankaku Yama\" (Triangle Mountain). From there, they compromised Eather's communication with the 2/33rd Battalion. Feeling his position was vulnerable, he requested and received permission from Allen to withdraw back to Imita Ridge, with Allen stressing that there could be no further withdrawal. Eather commenced the withdrawal from 11:00 am, which Anderson describes as, \"well-organised and orderly\".\n\nEather has been criticised, particularly by the author, Williams, for disengaging from battle too soon and ceding victory to Kusonose when the latter was at an impasse and frustrated. Having committed his reserve, Kusonose was still unable to break the Australian defence.\n\nOn 17 September, Eather was able to consolidate his position on Imita Ridge. The 2/33rd Battalion had been tasked to delay any further Japanese advance. A number of ambushes were set with mixed results. The Australian position, near the head of the track substantially resolved the difficulty of supply and the force was soon to be bolstered by the arrival of the 16th Brigade. Two 25-pounder guns of the 14th Field Regiment would at last be able to provide artillery support to Maroubra Force.\n\nAs the Japanese had advanced from Brigade Hill, a programme of patrolling was instigated to secure the flank approaches to Port Moresby. This utilised the 2/6th Independent Company extensively to patrol from Laloki along the Goldie River toward Ioribaiwa and for other tasks. Jawforce was raised from rear details of the 21st Brigade to patrol the eastern flank and approach from Nauro to Jawarere. Honner Force was raised with orders to attack Japanese supply lines between Nauro and Menari. Though the conceived plan came to nought through supply difficulties, it patrolled the western flank to the limit of its supply without encounter. \n\nUpon reaching Ioribaiwa, the lead Japanese elements began to celebrate—from their vantage point on the hills around Ioribaiwa, the Japanese soldiers could see the lights of Port Moresby and the Coral Sea beyond. They made no concerted attempt to advance on Eather's position at Imita Ridge.\n\nIn this interlude, Eather patrolled toward Ioribaiwa, both to harass the Japanese and to gather intelligence on their disposition. By 27 September, he issued orders to his battalion commanders for an \"all-out\" assault the following day. The attack found that Ioribaiwa had been abandoned and the artillery fired by the Australians had been without effect. Patrols followed up immediately, with one of the 2/25th Battalion finding that by 30 September, Nauro was unoccupied. Ordered to withdraw, the position at Ioribaiwa had been abandoned by the last Japanese troops during the night of 26 September.\n\nThe 25th Brigade, to which the 3rd Battalion was attached, commenced its advance against the Japanese and the 16th Brigade followed to occupy the positions on Imita Ridge. Allen was conscious of the supply difficulties he would encounter and moderated his advance accordingly but was pressured by Blamey and MacArthur to pursue what they perceived to be a fleeing enemy. In fact though, Horii's force had made a clean break and withdrawn back to a series of four defensive positions prepared in advance. These were the responsibility of the Stanley Detachment, which was based on the 2/144th Battalion. The first two positions were forward near the northern ends of the two tracks north from Kagi—the main Myola track and the original track, also known as the Mount Bellamy Track. The third position overlooked Templeton's Crossing, where the two tracks rejoined. The fourth position was at Eora Village.\n\nOn 10 October, Myola was reoccupied by the Australians. By 12 October, the 2/33rd Battalion was advancing toward Templeton's Crossing on the Myola Track and the 2/25th Battalion on the Mount Bellamy Track. The 16th Brigade was advancing on Menari to take up a position at Myola with the intention of taking the vanguard as the brigade moved through Templeton's Crossing.\n\nOn the Myola track, the Stanley Detachment had deployed its main force in-line along the track in considerable depth and in well developed positions. A forward patrol of the 2/33rd Battalion contacted the most lightly held forward position on 10 October. The positions resisted a series of frontal and flanking manoeuvres. Through 14 October, the 3rd Battalion moved around the western flank to co-ordinate with the 2/33rd Battalion in an attack on 15 October. However, the attack found that the Japanese had already withdrawn.\n\nOn the Mount Bellamy Track, the 2/25th Battalion met with the lesser Japanese force on 13 October and, after reporting the Japanese positions clear on 15 October, patrolled to Templeton's Crossing the following day. These two engagements have subsequently been identified as the opening phase of the Second Battle of Templeton's Crossing – Eora Creek.\n\nThe battalions of the 25th Brigade (less the 2/31st Battalion further back) reached the northern confluence of the tracks at Templeton's Crossing on 16 October. As the 3rd Battalion advanced, the Japanese position was identified in the late afternoon. It straddled the track on the high ground to the east of Eora Creek and north of the crossing. The Stanley detachment had occupied two parallel spurs running toward the creek from the main ridgeline. Cameron, now commanding the 3rd Battalion, concentrated his force for an attack on the morrow. Attacks on 17 and 18 October were directed from the high ground on the Japanese eastern flank by the 3rd Battalion and A and D Companies of the 2/25th Battalion but failed to achieve a decisive outcome.\n\nDuring the morning of 19 October, the 2/2nd Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Cedric Edgar pushed forward to assist the 3rd Battalion, while the remaining two battalions of the 16th Brigade, under the command of Brigadier John Lloyd relieved the 2/25th and 2/33rd Battalions. On 20 October, the 2/2nd Battalion mounted an attack employing four companies from the high-ground to the east. This attack was to be renewed the following day, 21 October, but the Stanley Detachment had withdrawn in the night. Horii's main force had been withdrawn to Kokoda–Oivi. When the Stanley Detachment was forced to withdraw from Templeton's Crossing, he sent all available reinforcement to man the final position at Eora Village.\n\nThe Australian advance then began toward Eora Village. As a patrol entered Eora Village at about 10:30 am, it was fired upon. From the village, the track crossed log bridges over Eora Creek and a tributary before following along the western side of Eora Creek as it headed northward. Overlooking the village from the north was a spur-line rising to the west. It was here that the Japanese had prepared two defensive positions – one on the lower slopes of the spur and another much higher up. Anderson reports that the Japanese had spent nearly two months in fortifying the position. From these, they could bring fire from medium machine guns and five artillery pieces.\n\nOn the afternoon of 22 October, against representations from his battalion commanders, Lloyd ordered a frontal attack on the Japanese [lower] position. This commenced shortly after. Anderson describes what followed as being highly confused but, dawn of 24 October found the attacking force of battalion strength largely pinned down in front of the Japanese position, having suffered 34 killed and many more injured, with no prospect of success. Lloyd then ordered the 2/3rd Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel John Stevenson to attack down on the Japanese positions from the top of Eora Ridge (to the west) but this took two days to deploy to the forming-up point.\n\nThe attack of the 2/3rd Battalion commenced in the morning of 27 October. Horii had ordered a withdrawal from the position on the night of 28 October. The 2/3rd Battalion resumed its attack on 28 October, co-ordinated with the remainder of the brigade. The position was now only lightly held by the 3rd/144th about to withdraw, and the situation turned into a rout.\n\nOn 28 October, Vasey arrived at Myola to relieve Allen. The Australian advance recommenced on 29 October. With a loss of positions that commanded the Gap and the approach to Port Moresby, Horii turned his attention to defending the beachheads at Buna–Gona. He concentrated his force around Oivi and Gorari. While a rearguard force screened his preparations, this was successively withdrawn without contact being made.\n\nAola was entered on 30 October and airdrops the following day alleviated supply problems as the Australian line-of-communication extended from Myola. On 2 November, a patrol of the 2/31st Battalion entered Kokoda and found that it had been abandoned. At 3:30 pm the following day, Vasey led a flag-raising ceremony with hundreds present. The 7th Division could now land supplies at Kokoda. On 6 November, Vasey held a further ceremony in which he awarded medals and made gifts of trade-goods to the Papuans that had supported the Australians.\n\nFrom Kokoda, the route to Wairopi, and then, to Buna–Gona, was mainly easterly, whereas the advance from Eora Village was mainly to the north. On the main track from Kokoda to Waropi (at the crossing of the Kumusi River) Horii had constructed strong defensive positions, prepared several weeks before. These were centred on the heights overlooking Oivi, with a position in depth at Gorari, which also covered an approach from the southern parallel track. The 41st Regiment, with a battalion of the 144th Regiment and seven artillery pieces faced an advance from the west. Two battalions of the 144th Regiment held the position at Gorari and a track approaching from the south. The force headquarters was to the immediate rear.\n\nThe 16th Brigade (including the 3rd Battalion) patrolled toward Oivi, making contact on 4 November. In fighting that continued until 6 November, it tried unsuccessfully to break the position. Vasey then committed the 25th Brigade, with the 2/1st Battalion attached, to an attack from the south toward Gorari. The brigade was to advance along the southern parallel track as far as Waju. The 2/1st Battalion leading, initially overshot this and had to retrace its steps but was ready to advance north on 7 November. Horii had become aware of the Australian movement and dispatched his two battalions at Gorari south along the connecting track. They established an all-round defence on a position near Baribe, about halfway between the two parallel tracks. Horii also called the 1st/144th back from Oivi to occupy the position left vacant at Goari.\n\nOn 8 November, Eather contacted the position at Baribe, enveloping it with the 2/25th and 2/31st Battalions. On 9 November, the 2/33rd and 2/1st Battalions pushed around the Japanese position on the connecting track and advanced on Gorari, where they attacked the 1/144th Battalion and Horii's headquarters. Bombing and strafing attacks were also conducted against the Japanese positions near Oivi. By 10 November, Horii ordered a withdrawal but the situation for the Japanese had degenerated into a rout. Fighting had largely ceased by midday 11 November. The Japanese lost around 430 killed, around 400 wounded and abandoned fifteen artillery pieces among other material.\n\nMost of the Japanese force withdrew to the Kumusi River and 1,200 are estimated to have made the crossing of the flooded river. Horii was swept downstream and later drowned. Others followed the river downstream to the coast. Milner reports the strength gathered there as 900, under command of Colonel Yazawa. The 25th Brigade contacted the Japanese rearguard near Wairopi on 12 November but these withdrew in the night. While most of Vasey's force was rested, patrols continued to search out Japanese survivors and engineers were dealing with the problem of establishing a bridgehead. The crossing of the two brigades was completed on the morning of 16 November and they began their advance on the Japanese beachheads. The 25th Brigade took the track toward Gona while the 16th Brigade advanced along the track toward Sanananda. Elements of the US 32nd Division were advancing on Buna by a coastal route from the southeast.\n\nThe US 32nd Division had arrived in Australia in May. With few US forces to choose from, General Douglas MacArthur ordered the divisional headquarters and two regimental combat teams from the 126th and 128th infantry regiments to deploy to Port Moresby. They arrived between 15 and 28 September 1942. On 11 September, MacArthur added a plan for the 126th Infantry Regiment to conduct a wide flanking move to the east with the goal to engage the Japanese rear near Wairopi. The 2nd Battalion 126th Regiment, with supporting elements attached, was tasked with traversing the track from Kapa Kapa to Jaure. From Jaure, at the headwaters of the Kumusi River, the force was to advance toward Wairopi. The little-used track from Kapa Kapa to Jaure was long.\n\nThe 32nd established a position at Kalikodobu, nicknamed \"Kalamazoo\" by the GIs, a short distance along the track. From here, the main body of the 2nd Battalion departed on 14 October 1942. The battalion had assembled at Jaure by 28 October. The Americans were utterly unprepared for the extremely harsh conditions they faced which significantly delayed their advance.\n\nThe planned envelopment of the Japanese forces never took place due to both the slow rate of the American advance and the unexpected, rapid withdrawal of the Japanese forces. While the 2/126th crawled over the Kapa Kapa Track, the balance of the 32nd Division was flown to newly developed advance airfields on the north side of the island. The 128th Regiment was flown to the most forward of these, located at Wanigella. From there, troops moved overland toward Buna or were ferried part of the way in coastal vessels, to meetup with Australian forces advancing on the Japanese beachheads. The first units of the 2/126th arrived in Soputa on 20 November 1942.\n\nA similar proposal for attacking the Japanese rear near Wairopi was made by Brigadier Potts, following withdrawal of the 21st Brigade after Ioribaiwa. Chaforce, raised from battalions of the 21st Brigade (each contributing a company) was to be assigned the task of penetrating from Myola into the Kumusi River valley. With initial approval to advance to Myola, the operation was subsequently cancelled sometime shortly after 18 October 1942.\n\nThe Japanese at Buna–Gona were reinforced by fresh units from Rabaul. The joint Australian–United States Army operation faced a formidable defence that had been prepared well in advance of their arrival and the battle lasted until 22 January 1943. The 39th Battalion participated in the fighting at the beachheads and, following its withdrawal, was only able to parade about 30 members – its ranks having been greatly depleted by injury and illness. In March 1943 it was withdrawn back to Australia where it was disbanded in July 1943.\n\nWhile this campaign, Milne Bay and the sea battles of Coral Sea and Midway ended the threat to Australia, the Australian government continued to warn the citizenry until mid-1943, that an invasion was possible. Allied operations against Japanese forces in New Guinea, including Operation Cartwheel and the Salamaua–Lae campaign, continued into 1945.\n\nA total of 13,500 Japanese were ultimately landed in Papua for the fighting during the campaign. Of these, about 6,000 or two regiments, were directly involved in the \"forward areas\" along the Track. Against this, the Allies assembled approximately 30,000 troops in New Guinea, although at any one time no more than one infantry brigade, or approximately 3,500 troops, were involved in the fighting for most of the campaign. In terms of total troops committed over the course of the campaign, author Peter Williams estimates that \"more than twice as many Australians than Japanese fought on the Kokoda Track\".\n\nCasualties amongst the Australians between 22 July and 16 November 1942 were 39 officers and 586 men killed and a further 64 officers and 991 men wounded, for a total of 625 killed and 1,055 wounded. Notably, three battalion commanders were killed or captured in the first month of fighting. Non-battle, or sickness, casualties are not accurately recorded but are stated to have been about two to three times the battle casualty figure. The exact number of Japanese casualties is not known, although Williams estimates battle casualties at 2,050 between the initial fighting around Awala and the final battle at Oivi–Gorari. Non-battle casualties, however, increase this figure and it is estimated that of the 6,000 troops, or five infantry battalions, that were committed to the fighting, up to 75% became casualties, being either killed, wounded or becoming ill.\n\nDuring the Tokyo War Crimes trial after the war, there was not enough evidence to bring formal charges with regards to the claims of cannibalism by Japanese soldiers. Some Japanese soldiers were tried and convicted in Australian-run military courts held in New Guinea. The Japanese were also responsible for the torture and execution of both combatant and non-combatant personnel including two female missionaries, May Hayman and Mavis Parkinson, during the campaign. Though not limited to the early stages of the campaign, McCarthy recounts events in the initial phase of the Kokoda campaign. All of the Australian servicemen captured during the course of the campaign were executed.\n\nAustralian soldiers also treated their opponents harshly. Most took a \"no quarter\" attitude, and killed Japanese personnel rather than attempt to take them prisoner in the infrequent occasions where Japanese troops attempted to surrender. Despite official instructions against doing so, Australian soldiers often took the personal possessions of dead Japanese and there were several instances where gold teeth were taken from corpses. These attitudes were influenced by a view that the Japanese were deceitful, a desire to exact revenge for atrocities committed against Allied personnel (including the killing of prisoners of war) and latent racism.\n\nThere is some debate as to whether the correct name for the route over the range is the \"Kokoda Track\" or \"Kokoda Trail\". The battle honour awarded for the campaign, as determined by the Battlefields Nomenclature Committee, is \"Kokoda Trail\". The Australian War Memorial has adopted \"Trail\", largely for this reason.\n\nDespite the historical use of \"Trail\", \"Track\" gained dominance in the 1990s, with the Australian \"Macquarie Dictionary\" stating that while both versions were in use, Kokoda Track \"appears to be the more popular of the two\".\n\nFor eligible Australian units, the battle honour \"Kokoda Trail\" was bestowed. Seven subsidiary honours were also bestowed. The honour, \"Kokoda–Deniki\" was awarded to the 39th Battalion and the Pacific Islands Regiment, which succeeded the PIB. The honour, \"Efogi–Menari\" was awarded for engagements between 6–9 September and included the battle at Brigade Hill–Mission Ridge. Other honours were: \"Isurava\", \"Eora Creek–Templeton's Crossing I\", \"Ioribaiwa\", \"Eora Creek–Templeton's Crossing II\" and \"Oivi–Gorari\". The 53rd Battalion did not receive any battle honour for the fighting during the Kokoda Track campaign.\n\nWhile the Gallipoli Campaign of World War I was Australia's first military test as a new nation, the fighting during the Kokoda campaign represents the first time in the nation's history that its security was directly threatened. The 1942 newsreel documentary, \"Kokoda Front Line!\" documented the Australian fighting during the campaign and brought the war home for many Australians. Filmed by Damien Parer, it won an Oscar for the documentary category – the first time an Australian film/documentary was awarded an Oscar. Curator, Poppy De Souza, observes: \"This iconic newsreel contains some of the most recognised images of Australian troops in the Second World War, images that have contributed to the collective visual memory of the events at Kokoda. ...[quoting Parer] a war that seemed until this point 'a million miles away’\". Although it has since become accepted that an invasion of Australia was not possible, or even planned by the Japanese, at the time there was a very real belief within Australia that this was possible and as such the Kokoda campaign has come to be viewed by some as the battle that \"saved Australia\". As a result, within the collective Australian psyche, the campaign and particularly the role of the 39th Battalion has become a key part of modern notions of the Anzac legend. Indeed, the Battle of Isurava has been described as \"Australia's Thermopylae\", although the key premise of this comparison—the idea that the Australians were outnumbered—has since been shown to be inaccurate.\n\nNevertheless, the Allied campaign was hampered by the poor intelligence available, which included antiquated maps, unfamiliarity with the terrain, and limited aerial photography. Senior military commanders including MacArthur and Blamey were unaware of the extraordinarily difficult terrain and the extreme conditions in which the battles would be fought, and orders given to the commanders were sometimes unrealistic given the conditions on the ground. In the end though, the strategy used against the Japanese in Papua—widely criticised at the time—led to an eventual, though costly, victory. The American official historian Samuel Milner judged that \"the only result, strategically speaking\" of the Kokoda track campaign and subsequent fighting in Papua \"was that after six months of bitter fighting and some 8,500 casualties, including 3,000 dead, the South West Pacific Area was exactly where it would have been the previous July had it been able to secure the beachhead before the Japanese got there\". More recently, Australian historian Nicholas Anderson has concluded that while the Kokoda Track was a significant Allied victory, it was less important to the outcome of the Pacific War than the defeat of the main Japanese effort at this time during the Guadalcanal Campaign.\n\nThe campaign also served to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the individual soldiers and the lower level commanders. Following this and the fighting that followed at Buna–Gona, the American and Australian armies would take steps to improve individual and unit training and medical and logistic infrastructure would also be greatly improved, with an increased focus upon air transport to solve the supply problem. Within the Australian Army, there was a major restructure with the formation of Jungle divisions which addressed manpower issues and were more suited to operations in jungle environments. There was a significant reduction in the scale of motor transport, and Jeeps, with greater cross-country mobility, were employed rather than trucks. At battalion level, changes included increasing the number of mortars to eight, the addition of a machine gun platoon with four Vickers guns to enhance organic fire support, and a removal of the carrier platoon. The Land Warfare Centre, as it is now known, was established at Canungra, Queensland, with an emphasis on training for jungle warfare. Adrian Threlfall, in his thesis and subsequent book explores the challenges faced and how these shaped the Australian Army as a jungle warfare force.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2098128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2098128", "title": "Mao: The Unknown Story", "text": "Mao: The Unknown Story\n\nMao: The Unknown Story is a 2005 biography of Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong (1893–1976) written by the wife and husband team of writer Jung Chang and historian Jon Halliday, who depict Mao as being responsible for more deaths in peacetime than Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin.\n\nIn conducting their research for the book over the course of a decade, the authors interviewed hundreds of people who were close to Mao Zedong at some point in his life, used recently published memoirs from Chinese political figures, and explored newly opened archives in China and Russia. Chang herself lived through the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, which she described in her earlier book, \"Wild Swans\" (1991).\n\nThe book quickly became a best-seller in Europe and North America. It received overwhelming praise from reviews in national newspapers and also drew praise from some academics. Academic reviews from China specialists were, on the whole, mostly critical.\n\nChang and Halliday do not accept the idealistic explanations for Mao's rise to power or common claims for his rule. She portrays him as a tyrant who manipulated everyone and everything he could in pursuit of personal power. They argue that from his earliest years he was motivated by a lust for power and that Mao had many political opponents arrested and murdered, regardless of their relationship with him. During the 1920s and 1930s, they argue, Mao could not have gained control of the party without Stalin's patronage, nor were Mao's decisions during the Long March as heroic and ingenious as Edgar Snow's \"Red Star Over China\" claimed and thereby entered the mythology of the revolution. Chiang Kai-shek deliberately did not pursue and capture the Red Army. Chang wrote this biography to debunk the myth of Mao as an emblem of Chinese government that survives even to this day.\n\nAreas under Communist control during the Second United Front and Chinese Civil War, such as the Jiangxi and Yan'an soviets, were ruled through terror and financed by opium. Mao, they say, sacrificed thousands of troops simply in order to get rid of party rivals, such as Chang Kuo-tao, nor did he take the initiative in fighting the Japanese invaders. Despite being born into a wealthy peasant (kulak) family, when Mao came to power in 1949 he had little concern for the welfare of the Chinese peasantry. Mao's determination to use agricultural surplus to subsidize industry and intimidation of dissent led to murderous famines resulting from the Great Leap Forward, exacerbated by allowing the export of grain to continue even when it became clear that China did not have sufficient grain to feed its population.\n\nChang and Halliday argue that the Long March was not the courageous effort portrayed by the Chinese Communist Party and that Mao's role in leading it was exaggerated. Chang refers to the march as a myth that has been tweaked and exaggerated throughout the decades by the Chinese government. They argue that today the Long March's validity is questionable, because it has diverged so far from reality. Officially portrayed as an inspiring commander, the authors write that he was nearly left behind by the March and only commanded a fairly small force. He was apparently disliked by almost all of the people on the March and his tactics and strategy were flawed. They also write that Chiang Kai-shek allowed the Communists to proceed without significant hindrance. They provided the communists with maps and allowed them to escape the clutches of his army because his son was being held hostage in Moscow and he feared he would be killed if the Communists failed.\n\nMao is also portrayed, along with the Communist elite, as a privileged person who was usually carried around in litters and protected from the suffering of his subordinates, rather than sharing their hardship. Despite the high level of casualties amongst ordinary soldiers, supposedly no high-ranking leaders died on the journey, regardless of how ill or badly wounded they were.\n\nThe book says that, contrary to revolutionary mythology, there was no battle at Luding Bridge and that tales of a \"heroic\" crossing against the odds was merely propaganda. Chang found a witness, Li Xiu-zhen, who told her that she saw no fighting and that the bridge was not on fire. In addition, she said that despite claims by the Communists that the fighting was fierce, all of the vanguard survived the battle. Chang also cited Nationalist (Kuomintang) battleplans and communiques that indicated the force guarding the bridge had been withdrawn before the Communists arrived.\n\nA number of historical works, even outside of China, do depict such a battle, though not of such heroic proportions. Harrison E. Salisbury's \"The Long March: The Untold Story\" and Charlotte Salisbury's \"Long March Diary\" mention a battle at Luding Bridge, but they relied on second-hand information. However, there is disagreement in other sources over the incident. Chinese journalist Sun Shuyun agreed that the official accounts were exaggerated. She interviewed a local blacksmith who had witnessed the event and said that \"when [the troops opposing the Red Army] saw the soldiers coming, they panicked and fled — their officers had long abandoned them. There wasn't really much of a battle.\" Archives in Chengdu further supported this claim.\n\nIn October 2005, \"The Age\" newspaper reported that it had been unable to find Chang's local witness. In addition, \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" found an 85-year-old eyewitness, Li Guixiu, aged 15 at the time of the crossing, whose account disputed Chang's claims. According to Li, there was a battle: \"The fighting started in the evening. There were many killed on the Red Army side. The KMT set fire to the bridge-house on the other side, to try to melt the chains, and one of the chains was cut. After it was taken, the Red Army took seven days and seven nights to cross.\"\n\nIn a speech given at Stanford University, former US National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski mentioned a conversation that he once had with Deng Xiaoping. He recalled that Deng smiled and said, \"Well, that's the way it's presented in our propaganda. We needed that to express the fighting spirit of our forces. In fact, it was a very easy military operation.\"\n\nOne of the allegations in the book against Mao was that he not just tolerated the production of opium in regions that the Communists controlled during the Chinese Civil War but also participated in the trade of it, in order to provide funding for his soldiers. According to Russian sources that the authors state they found, at the time the trade generated around $60 million a year for the Communists. This was stopped only due to overproduction driving down the price and Communist officials other than Mao deciding that the practice was immoral.\n\nMao is alleged to have exposed men under his command to unnecessary suffering just to eliminate his opponents. Zhang Guotao, a rival in the Politburo, was sent with his army in 1936 on a hopeless mission into the Gobi desert. When it inevitably failed Mao ordered that the survivors be executed.\n\nChang and Halliday suggest that Mao used other underhanded means in eliminating opponents. Apart from general purges like the Hundred Flowers Campaign and other operations like the Cultural Revolution, he had Wang Ming (another Politburo rival) poisoned twice; Wang had to seek treatment in Russia.\n\nChang and Halliday write that in comparison to official history provided by the Chinese authorities that Communist forces waged a tough guerrilla war against the Imperial Japanese Army, in truth they rarely fought the Japanese. Mao was more interested in saving his forces for fighting against the Chinese Nationalists. On the few occasions that the Communists did fight the Japanese, Mao was very angry.\n\nNotable members of the KMT were claimed to have been secretly working for the Chinese Communists. One such \"sleeper\" was Hu Zongnan, a senior National Revolutionary Army general. Hu's son objected to this description and his threat of legal action led Jung Chang's publishers in Taiwan to abandon the release of the book there.\n\n\nRather than reluctantly entering the conflict as the Chinese government suggests, Mao is shown to have deliberately entered the Korean War, having promised Chinese troops to Kim Il Sung (then leader of North Korea) before the conflict started. Also, the book details Mao's desperation in needing economic and military aid promised by the Soviets, as the prime motivating factor in backing Kim Il-sung's invasion of South Korea. Halliday had previously conducted research into this conflict, publishing his book \"Korea: The Unknown War\".\n\nThe book opens with the sentence \"Mao Tse-tung, who for decades held absolute power over the lives of one-quarter of the world's population, was responsible for well over 70 million deaths in peacetime, more than any other twentieth century leader.\" He referred to the peasants as \"two shoulders and a bum,\" because at any given time they could be killed, but even more would be left alive. Chang and Halliday claim that he was willing for half of China to die to achieve military-nuclear superpowerdom. Estimates of the numbers of deaths during this period vary, though Chang and Halliday's estimate is one of the highest. Sinologist Stuart Schram, in a review of the book, noted that \"the exact figure... has been estimated by well-informed writers at between 40 and 70 million\".\n\nChina scholars agree that the famine during the Great Leap Forward caused tens of millions of deaths. Chang and Halliday argue that this period accounts for roughly half of the 70 million total. An official estimate by Hu Yaobang in 1980 put the death toll at 20 million, whereas Philip Short in his 2000 book \"Mao: A Life\" found 20 to 30 million to be the most credible number. Chang and Halliday's figure is 37.67 million, which historian Stuart Schram indicated that he believes \"may well be the most accurate.\" Yang Jisheng, a Communist party member and former reporter for Xinhua, puts the number of famine deaths at 36 million. In his 2010 book , Hong Kong based historian Frank Dikötter, who has had access to newly opened local archives, places the death toll for the Great Leap Forward at 45 million, and describes it as \"one of the most deadly mass killings of human history.\"\n\nProfessor R. J. Rummel published updated figures on worldwide democide in 2005, stating that he believed Chang and Halliday's estimates to be mostly correct and that he had revised his figures for China under Mao accordingly.\n\n\"Mao: The Unknown Story\" became a bestseller, with United Kingdom sales alone reaching 60,000 in six months. Academics and commentators wrote reviews ranging from great praise to serious criticism. The review aggregator Metacritic report the book received an average score of 64 out of 100, based on 24 reviews from major English-language media press.\n\nThe book has received praise from a number of commentators and academic experts. Simon Sebag Montefiore lauded the book in \"The Times\", calling Chang and Halliday's work \"a triumph\" which \"exposes its subject as probably the most disgusting of the bloody troika of 20th-century tyrant-messiahs, in terms of character, deeds — and number of victims... This is the first intimate, political biography of the greatest monster of them all — the Red Emperor of China.\"\n\nIn \"The New York Times\", Nicholas Kristof referred to the book as a \"magisterial work\". Kristof said that it did a better job demonstrating that Mao was a \"catastrophic ruler\" than anything else written to date. In his words Mao's \"ruthlessness\" was \"brilliantly captured in this extraordinary book\".\n\nGwynne Dyer praised the book for documenting \"Mao's crimes and failures in unrelenting, unprecedented detail\" and stated he believed it would eventually have a similar impact in China as Alexander Solzhenitsyn's \"Gulag Archipelago\" did in the Soviet Union.\n\nHistorian Max Hastings say the book is a \"savage indictment, drawing on a host of sources including important Soviet ones, to blow away the miasma of deceit and ignorance which still shrouds Mao's life from many Western eyes.\" But that its weakness is \"it attributes Mao's rise and long rule entirely to repression, and does not explain why so many of his own people remained for so long committed to his insane vision.\"\n\nMichael Yahuda, Professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics, also expressed his support in \"The Guardian\". He referred to it a \"magnificent book\" and \"a stupendous work\" which cast \"new and revealing light on nearly every episode in Mao's tumultuous life.\"\n\nProfessor Richard Baum of the University of California, Los Angeles said that \"it has to be taken very seriously as the most thoroughly researched and richly documented piece of synthetic scholarship yet to appear on the rise of Mao and the CCP.\" Though it was \"not a sufficiently rich or nuanced interpretive scaffolding to support the full weight of the Chinese experience under Mao,\" Baum still believed that \"this book will most likely change forever the way modern Chinese history is understood and taught.\"\n\nStuart Schram, while criticizing certain aspects of \"Mao: The Unknown Story\", argued in a review in \"The China Quarterly\" that Chang and Halliday's book was \"a valuable contribution to our understanding of Mao and his place in history.\"\n\nPerry Link, then a Princeton University Professor of Chinese literature, praised the book in \"The Times Literary Supplement\" and emphasized the effect the book could have in the West.\n\nPart of Chang and Halliday's passion for exposing the 'unknown' Mao is clearly aimed at gullible Westerners... For decades many in the Western intellectual and political elites have assumed that Mao and his heirs symbolize the Chinese people and their culture, and that to show respect to the rulers is the same as showing respect to the subjects. Anyone who reads Jung Chang and Jon Halliday's book should be inoculated against this particular delusion. If the book sells even half as many copies as the 12 million of \"Wild Swans\", it could deliver the coup de grace to an embarrassing and dangerous pattern of Western thinking.\n\nProfessor Andrew Nathan of Columbia University published an extensive evaluation of the book in the \"London Review of Books\". While he was complimentary of the book in some respects — noting for example that it \"shows special insight into the suffering of Mao's wives and children\" — and acknowledged that it might make real contributions to the field, Nathan's review was largely negative. He noted that \"many of their discoveries come from sources that cannot be checked, others are openly speculative or are based on circumstantial evidence, and some are untrue.\" Similarly, Professor Jonathan Spence of Yale University argued in the \"New York Review of Books\" that the authors' single focus on Mao's vileness had undermined \"much of the power their story might have had.\"\n\nChang and Halliday's book has been strongly criticized by various academic experts. In December 2005, \"The Observer\" newspaper stated that many knowledgeable academics of the field have questioned the factual accuracy of some of Chang and Halliday's claims, notably their selective use of evidence, questioning their stance in the matter, among other criticisms, although the article also said that Chang and Halliday's critics did not deny that Mao was \"a monster\".\n\nDavid S. G. Goodman, Professor of Chinese Politics at the University of Sydney, wrote in \"The Pacific Review\" that \"Mao: The Unknown Story\", like other examples of revisionist histories, implied that there had been \"a conspiracy of academics and scholars who have chosen not to reveal the truth.\" Goodman argued that as popular history the book's style was \"extremely polemic\" and he was highly critical of Chang and Halliday's methodology and use of sources as well as specific conclusions.\n\nProfessor Thomas Bernstein of Columbia University referred to the book as \"... a major disaster for the contemporary China field...\" because the \"scholarship is put at the service of thoroughly destroying Mao's reputation. The result is an equally stupendous number of quotations out of context, distortion of facts and omission of much of what makes Mao a complex, contradictory, and multi-sided leader.\"\n\n\"The China Journal\" invited a group of specialists to give assessments of the book in the area of their expertise. Professors Gregor Benton (Cardiff University) and Steve Tsang (University of Oxford) argued that Chang and Halliday \"misread sources, use them selectively, use them out of context, or otherwise trim or bend them to cast Mao in an unrelentingly bad light.\" Timothy Cheek (University of British Columbia) then argued that the book is \"not a history in the accepted sense of a reasoned historical analysis,\" rather it \"reads like an entertaining Chinese version of a TV soap opera.\" University of California at Berkeley political scientist Lowell Dittmer added that \"surely the depiction is overdrawn,\" but what emerges is a story of \"absolute power\" leading first to personal corruption in the form of sexual indulgence and paranoia, and second, policy corruption, consisting of the power to realize \"fantastic charismatic visions and ignore negative feedback...\" Geremie Barmé (Australian National University) observed that while \"anyone familiar with the lived realities of the Mao years can sympathize with the authors' outrage\" one must ask whether \"a vengeful spirit serves either author or reader well, especially in the creation of a mass market work that would claim authority and dominance in the study of Mao Zedong and his history.\" \n\nThe 2009 anthology, \"Was Mao Really a Monster: The Academic Response to Chang and Halliday's \"Mao: The Unknown Story\"\", edited by Gregor Benton and Lin Chun, brings together fourteen mostly critical previously published academic responses, including the reviews from \"China Journal\". Benton and Lin write in their introduction that \"unlike the worldwide commercial media... most professional commentary has been disapproving.\" They challenge the assertion that Mao was responsible for 70 million deaths, since the number's origin is vague and substantiation shaky. They include an extensive list of further reviews. Mobo Gao, Professor of Chinese Studies at the University of Adelaide, wrote that \"The Unknown Story\" was \"intellectually scandalous\", saying that it \"misinterprets evidence, ignores the existing literature, and makes sensationalist claims without proper evidence.\"\n\nIn writing for the New Left Review, British historian and public intellectual Tariq Ali criticized the book for its focus \"on Mao’s conspicuous imperfections (political and sexual), exaggerating them to fantastical heights and advancing moral criteria for political leaders that they would never apply to a Roosevelt or a Kennedy\". Ali accused the book of including unsourced and unproven claims; archival material from Mao's political opponents in Taiwan and the Soviet Union whose reliability are disputed; as well as celebrity interviewees such as Lech Wałęsa whose knowledge of Mao and China are limited. Ali compared the book's sensationalist passages and denunciations of Mao to Mao's own political slogans during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nIn December 2005, an article by \"The Observer\" newspaper on the book contained a brief statement from Chang and Halliday in regards to the general criticism. The authors said that \"the academics' views on Mao and Chinese history cited represent received wisdom of which we were well aware while writing our biography of Mao. We came to our own conclusions and interpretations of events through a decade's research.\" The authors also responded to Andrew Nathan's review in a letter to \"The London Review of Books\".\n\nAndrew Nathan also replied to the authors' response and the following points are especially useful for readers: \"Most of Jung Chang and Jon Halliday's complaints fall into two overlapping categories: I did not check enough sources; I misinterpreted what they or their sources said.\" \"Chang and Halliday's method of citation makes it necessary for the reader to check multiple sources in order to track down the basis for any single assertion. There were many passages in their book which I had doubts about that I could not check because the sources were anonymous, unpublished, or simply too hard to get. It's true that I did not visit the Wang Ming papers in Russia or telephone the Japanese Communist Party. Is Chang and Halliday's invitation to do this a fair substitute for citations to the documents they used – author, title, date, and where seen? I limited my published criticisms to those for which I was able to get hold of what appeared to be all the sources.\"\n\n\n\"Mao: The Unknown Story\" was on the \"Sunday Times\" bestseller list at number 2, in July 2005.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2098151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2098151", "title": "Fountain (Duchamp)", "text": "Fountain (Duchamp)\n\nFountain is a readymade sculpture produced by Marcel Duchamp in 1917, consisting of a porcelain urinal signed \"R.Mutt\". In April 1917, an ordinary piece of plumbing chosen by Duchamp was submitted for an exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists, the inaugural exhibition by the Society to be staged at The Grand Central Palace in New York. In Duchamp's presentation, the urinal's orientation was altered from its usual positioning. \"Fountain\" was not rejected by the committee, since Society rules stated that all works would be accepted from artists who paid the fee, but the work was never placed in the show area. Following that removal, \"Fountain\" was photographed at Alfred Stieglitz's studio, and the photo published in \"The Blind Man\". The original has been lost.\n\nThe work is regarded by art historians and theorists of the avant-garde as a major landmark in 20th-century art. Sixteen replicas were commissioned from Duchamp in the 1950s and 1960s and made to his approval. Some scholars have suggested that the original work was by an unidentified female artist who had submitted it to her friend Duchamp, but historians generally believe that Duchamp was solely responsible for \"Fountain\"'s presentation.\n\nMarcel Duchamp arrived in the United States less than two years prior to the creation of \"Fountain\" and had become involved with Francis Picabia, Man Ray, Beatrice Wood amongst others in the creation of an anti-rational, anti-art, proto-Dada cultural movement in New York City.\n\nIn early 1917, rumors spread that Duchamp was working on a Cubist painting titled \"Tulip Hysteria Co-ordinating\", in preparation for the largest exhibition of modern art ever to take place in the United States. When \"Tulip Hysteria Co-ordinating\" did not appear at the show, those who had expected to see it were disappointed. But the painting likely never existed.\n\nAccording to one version, the creation of \"Fountain\" began when, accompanied by artist Joseph Stella and art collector Walter Arensberg, Duchamp purchased a standard Bedfordshire model urinal from the J. L. Mott Iron Works, 118 Fifth Avenue. The artist brought the urinal to his studio at 33 West 67th Street, reoriented it 90 degrees from its originally intended position of use, and wrote on it, \"R. Mutt 1917\". Duchamp elaborated:\n\nMutt comes from Mott Works, the name of a large sanitary equipment manufacturer. But Mott was too close so I altered it to Mutt, after the daily cartoon strip \"Mutt and Jeff\" which appeared at the time, and with which everyone was familiar. Thus, from the start, there was an interplay of Mutt: a fat little funny man, and Jeff: a tall thin man... I wanted any old name. And I added Richard [French slang for money-bags]. That's not a bad name for a \"pissotière\". Get it? The opposite of poverty. But not even that much, just R. MUTT.\n\nAt the time Duchamp was a board member of the Society of Independent Artists. After much debate by the board members (most of whom did not know Duchamp had submitted it) about whether the piece was or was not art, \"Fountain\" was hidden from view during the show. Duchamp resigned from the Board, and \"withdrew\" \"Tulip Hysteria Co-ordinating\" in protest. \"Fountain\", wrote the committee, \"may be a very useful object in its place, but its place is not an art exhibition, and it is by no definition, a work of art.\" For this reason the work was \"suppressed\" (Duchamp's expression).\n\nNo, not rejected. A work can’t be rejected by the Independents. It was simply suppressed. I was on the jury, but I wasn’t consulted, because the officials didn't know that it was I who had sent it in; I had written the name \"Mutt\" on it to avoid connection with the personal. The \"Fountain\" was simply placed behind a partition and, for the duration of the exhibition, I didn’t know where it was. I couldn't say that I had sent the thing, but I think the organizers knew it through gossip. No one dared mention it. I had a falling out with them, and retired from the organization. After the exhibition, we found the \"Fountain\" again, behind a partition, and I retrieved it! (Marcel Duchamp, 1971)\n\nThe New York Dadaists stirred controversy about \"Fountain\" and its being rejected in the second issue of \"The Blind Man\" which included a photo of the piece and a letter by Alfred Stieglitz, and writings by Louise Norton, Beatrice Wood and Arensberg. The editorial, written by Louise Norton, accompanying the photograph, entitled \"The Richard Mutt Case\", made a claim that would prove to be important concerning certain works of art that would come after it:\n\nIn defense of the work being art, Norton also wrote, \"The only works of art America has given are her plumbing and her bridges.\" Duchamp described his intent with the piece was to shift the focus of art from physical craft to intellectual interpretation.\n\nIn a letter dated 23 April 1917, Stieglitz wrote of the photograph he took of \"Fountain\": \"The \"Urinal\" photograph is really quite a wonder—Everyone who has seen it thinks it beautiful—And it's true—it is. It has an oriental look about it—a cross between a Buddha and a Veiled Woman.\"\n\nIn 1918, \"Mercure de France\" published an article attributed to Guillaume Apollinaire stating \"Fountain\", originally titled \"le Bouddha de la salle de bain\" (Buddha of the bathroom), represented a sitting Buddha. The motive invoked for its refusal at the Independents were that the entry was (1) immoral and vulgar, (2) it was plagiarism, a commercial piece of plumbing. R. Mutt responded, according to Apollinaire, that the work was not immoral since similar pieces could be seen every day exposed in plumbing and bath supply stores. On the second point, R. Mutt pointed out that the fact \"Fountain\" was not made by the hand of the artist was unimportant. The importance was in the choice made by the artist. The artist chose an object of every-day life, erased its usual significance by giving it a new title, and from this point of view, gave a new purely esthetic meaning to the object.\n\nMenno Hubregtse argues that Duchamp may have chosen \"Fountain\" as a readymade because it parodied Robert J. Coady's exaltation of industrial machines as pure forms of American art. Coady, who championed his call for American art in his publication \"The Soil\", printed a scathing review of Jean Crotti's \"Portrait of Marcel Duchamp (Sculpture Made to Measure)\" in the December 1916 issue. Hubregtse notes that Duchamp's urinal may have been a clever response to Coady's comparison of Crotti's sculpture with \"the absolute expression of a—plumber.\"\n\nSome have contested that Duchamp created \"Fountain\", but rather assisted in submitting the piece to the Society of Independent Artists for a female friend. In a letter dated 11 April 1917 Duchamp wrote to his sister Suzanne: \"Une de mes amies sous un pseudonyme masculin, Richard Mutt, avait envoyé une pissotière en porcelaine comme sculpture\" (\"One of my female friends under a masculine pseudonym, Richard Mutt, sent in a porcelain urinal as a sculpture.\") Duchamp never identified his female friend, but three candidates have been proposed: an early appearance of Duchamp's female alter ego Rrose Sélavy; the Dadaist Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven; or Louise Norton (a Dada poet later married to the avant-garde French composer Edgard Varèse), who contributed an essay to \"The Blind Man\" discussing \"Fountain\", and whose address is partially discernible on the paper entry ticket in the Stieglitz photograph. On one hand, the fact that Duchamp wrote 'sent' not 'made', does not indicate that someone else created the work. Furthermore, there is no documentary or testimonial evidence that suggests von Freytag created \"Fountain\".\n\nShortly after its initial exhibition, \"Fountain\" was lost. According to Duchamp biographer Calvin Tomkins, the best guess is that it was thrown out as rubbish by Stieglitz, a common fate of Duchamp's early readymades.\n\nThe reaction engendered by \"Fountain\" continued for weeks following the exhibition submission. An article was published in Boston on 25 April 1917:\n\nThe first reproduction of \"Fountain\" was authorized by Duchamp in 1950 for an exhibition in New York; two more individual pieces followed in 1953 and 1963, and then an artist's multiple was manufactured in an edition of eight in 1964. These editions ended up in a number of important public collections; Indiana University Art Museum, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery of Canada, Centre Georges Pompidou and Tate Modern. The edition of eight was manufactured from glazed earthenware painted to resemble the original porcelain, with a signature, reproduced in black paint.\n\nOf all the artworks in this series of readymades, \"Fountain\" is perhaps the best known because the symbolic meaning of the toilet takes the conceptual challenge posed by the readymades to their most visceral extreme. Similarly, philosopher Stephen Hicks argued that Duchamp, who was quite familiar with the history of European art, was obviously making a provocative statement with \"Fountain\":\n\nSince the photograph taken by Stieglitz is the only image of the original sculpture, there are some interpretations of \"Fountain\" by looking not only at reproductions but this particular photograph. Tomkins notes: \n\nThe meaning (if any) and intention of both the piece and the signature \"R. Mutt\", are difficult to pin down precisely. It is not clear whether Duchamp had in mind the German \"\"Armut\"\" (meaning \"poverty\"), or possibly \"\"Urmutter\"\" (meaning “great mother”). The name R. Mutt could also be a play on its commercial origins or on the famous comic strip of the time, \"Mutt and Jeff\" (making the urinal perhaps the first work of art based on a comic). Duchamp said the R stood for Richard, French slang for \"moneybags\", which makes \"Fountain\" a kind of scatological golden calf.\n\nRhonda Roland Shearer in the online journal \"Tout-Fait\" (2000) suspects that the Stieglitz photograph is a composite of different photos, while other scholars such as William Camfield have never been able to match the urinal shown in the photo to any urinals found in the catalogues of the time period.\n\nIn a 1964 interview with Otto Hahn, Duchamp suggested he purposefully selected a urinal because it was disagreeable. The choice of a urinal, according to Duchamp, \"sprang from the idea of making an experiment concerned with taste: choose the object which has the least chance of being liked. A urinal-very few people think there is anything wonderful about a urinal.\"\n\nRudolf E. Kuenzli states, in \"Dada and Surrealist Film\" (1996), after describing how various readymades are presented or displayed: \"This decontextualization of the object's functional place draws attention to the creation of its artistic meaning by the choice of the setting and positioning ascribed to the object.\" He goes on to explain the importance of naming the object (ascribing a title). At least three factors came into play: the choice of object, the title, and how it was modified, if at all, from its 'normal' position or location. By virtue of placing a urinal on a pedestal in an art exhibition, the illusion of an artwork was created.\n\nDuchamp drew an ink copy of the 1917 Stieglitz photograph in 1964 for the cover of an exhibition catalogue, \"Marcel Duchamp: Ready-mades, etc., 1913–1964\". The illustration appeared as a photographic negative. Later, Duchamp made a positive version, titled \"Mirrorical Return\" (\"Renvoi miroirique\"; 1964). Dalia Judovitz writes:\nStructured as an emblem, the visual and linguistic elements set up a punning interplay that helps us to explore further the mechanisms that \"Fountain\" actively stages. On the one hand, there is the mirror-effect of the drawing and the etching, which although they are almost identical visually, involve an active switch from one artistic medium to the other. On the other hand, there is the internal mirrorical return of the image itself, since this urinal, like the one in 1917, has been rotated ninety degrees. This internal rotation disqualifies the object from its common use as a receptacle, and reactivates its poetic potential as a fountain; that is, as a machine for waterworks. The \"splash\" generated by \"Fountain\" is thus tied to its \"mirrorical return,\" like the faucet in the title.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, as \"Fountain\" and other readymades were rediscovered, Duchamp became a cultural icon in the world of art, exemplified by a \"deluge of publications\", as Camfield noted, \"an unparalleled example of timing in which the burgeoning interest in Duchamp coincided with exhilarating developments in avant-garde art, virtually all of which exhibited links of some sort to Duchamp.\" His art was transformed from \"a minor, aberrant phenomenon in the history of modern art to the most dynamic force in contemporary art.\"\n\nIn December 2004, Duchamp's \"Fountain\" was voted the most influential artwork of the 20th century by 500 selected British art world professionals. Second place was afforded to Picasso's \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\" (1907) and third to Andy Warhol's \"Marilyn Diptych\" (1962). \"The Independent\" noted in a February 2008 article that with this single work, Duchamp invented conceptual art and \"severed forever the traditional link between the artist's labour and the merit of the work\".\n\nJerry Saltz wrote in \"The Village Voice\" in 2006:\n\nSeveral performance artists have attempted to \"contribute\" to the piece by urinating in it.\nSouth African born artist Kendell Geers rose to international notoriety in 1993 when, at a show in Venice, he urinated into \"Fountain\". Artist / musician Brian Eno declared successfully urinating in \"Fountain\" while exhibited in the MoMA in 1993. He admitted that it was only a technical triumph because he needed to urinate in a tube in advance so he could convey the fluid through a gap between the protective glass. Swedish artist Björn Kjelltoft urinated in \"Fountain\" at Moderna Museet in Stockholm in 1999.\n\nIn spring 2000, Yuan Chai and Jian Jun Xi, two performance artists, who in 1999 had jumped on Tracey Emin's installation-sculpture \"My Bed\" in the Turner Prize exhibition at Tate Britain, went to the newly opened Tate Modern and tried to urinate on the \"Fountain\" which was on display. However, they were prevented from soiling the sculpture directly by its Perspex case. The Tate, which denied that the duo had succeeded in urinating into the sculpture itself, banned them from the premises stating that they were threatening \"works of art and our staff.\" When asked why they felt they had to add to Duchamp's work, Chai said, \"The urinal is there – it's an invitation. As Duchamp said himself, it's the artist's choice. He chooses what is art. We just added to it.\"\n\nOn January 4, 2006, while on display in the Dada show in the Pompidou Centre in Paris, \"Fountain\" was attacked by Pierre Pinoncelli, a 76-year-old French performance artist, most noted for damaging two of the eight copies of \"Fountain\". The hammer he used during the assault on the artwork caused a slight chip. Pinoncelli, who was arrested, said the attack was a work of performance art that Marcel Duchamp himself would have appreciated. In 1993 Pinoncelli urinated into the piece while it was on display in Nimes, in southern France. Both of Pinoncelli's performances derive from neo-Dadaists' and Viennese Actionists' intervention or manoeuvre.\n\nFrom the 1950s, Duchamp's influence on American artists had grown exponentially. Life magazine referred to him as \"perhaps the world's most eminent Dadaist\", Dada's \"spiritual leader\", \"Dada's Daddy\" in a lengthy article published 28 April 1952. By the mid-50s his readymades were present in permanent collections of American museums.\n\nIn 1961, Duchamp wrote a letter to fellow Dadaist Hans Richter in which he supposedly said:\n\nRichter, however, years later claimed those words were not by Duchamp. Richter had sent Duchamp this paragraph for comment, writing: \"You threw the bottle rack and the urinal into their face…,\" etc. Duchamp simply wrote: \"Ok, ça va très bien\" (\"Ok, that works very well\") in the margins.\n\nContrary to Richter's quote, Duchamp wrote favorably of Pop art in 1964, though indifferent to the humor or materials of Pop artists:\n\nThe prices for replicas, editions, or works that have some ephemeral trace of Duchamp reached its peak with the purchase of one of the eight 1964 replicas of \"Fountain\". 17 November 1999, a version of \"Fountain\" (owned by Arturo Schwarz) was sold at Sotheby's, New York, for $1,762,500 to Dimitris Daskalopoulos, who declared that \"Fountain\" represented 'the origin of contemporary art'. The price set a world record, at the time, for a work by Marcel Duchamp at public auction. The record was surpassed in 2009 by his 1921 readymade \"Belle Haleine, Eau de Voilette\", a perfume bottle in its box which sold for $11.4 million.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was the official rank used by inspectors to distinguish them from the more senior sub-divisional inspectors. Both ranks had one star (or \"pip\") as their insignia and their titles were considered appointments. The sub-divisional inspector later received two stars in 1922 to reduce confusion between the two levels of command.\n\nIn 1936 the rank of junior station inspector was created for Metropolitan Police College cadets and those thereafter completing their probationary period at a police station. To differentiate between the trainee rank and the appointed rank a new rank badge was created. One rectangular bar was placed under the star for a junior station inspector and two rectangular bars was placed under the star for a full station inspector. The rank of junior station inspector was abolished in 1938 and the Metropolitan Police College was closed in 1939. The insignia for junior station inspector was used until 1941, when the last graduates who held the rank had completed their probationary period.\n\nIn 1941, the rank of temporary or probationary inspector was granted one star, the rank of station inspector received two \"stars, and the rank of sub-divisional inspector received three stars. In 1949, the inspector ranks were reorganised. The rank of station inspector was changed to inspector and the rank of sub-divisional inspector abolished.\n\n"}

{"id": "2098235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2098235", "title": "Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2", "text": "Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2\n\nNude Descending a Staircase, No. 2 (French: \"Nu descendant un escalier n° 2\") is a 1912 painting by Marcel Duchamp. The work is widely regarded as a Modernist classic and has become one of the most famous of its time. Before its first presentation at the 1912 Salon des Indépendants in Paris it was rejected by the Cubists as being too Futurist. It was then exhibited with the Cubists at Galeries Dalmau's \"Exposició d'Art Cubista\", in Barcelona, 20 April–10 May 1912. The painting was subsequently shown, and ridiculed, at the 1913 Armory Show in New York City.\n\n\"Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2\" was reproduced by Guillaume Apollinaire in his 1913 book, \"Les Peintres Cubistes, Méditations Esthétiques\". It is now in the Louise and Walter Arensberg Collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\nThe work, an oil painting on canvas with dimensions of 147 cm × 89.2 cm (57.9 in × 35.1 in) in portrait, seemingly depicts a figure demonstrating an abstract movement in its ochres and browns. The discernible \"body parts\" of the figure are composed of nested, conical and cylindrical abstract elements, assembled together in such a way as to suggest rhythm and convey the movement of the figure merging into itself. Dark outlines limit the contours of the body while serving as motion lines that emphasize the dynamics of the moving figure, while the accented arcs of the dotted lines seem to suggest a thrusting pelvic motion. The movement seems to be rotated counterclockwise from the upper left to the lower right corner, where the gradient of the apparently frozen sequence corresponding to the bottom right to top left dark, respectively, becomes more transparent, the fading of which is apparently intended to simulate the \"older\" section. At the edges of the picture, the steps are indicated in darker colors. The center of the image is an amalgam of light and dark, that becomes more piqued approaching the edges. The overall warm, monochrome bright palette ranges from yellow ochre to dark, almost black tones. The colors are translucent. At the bottom left Duchamp placed the title \"NU DESCENDANT UN ESCALIER\" in block letters, which may or may not be related to the work. The question of whether the figure represents a human body remains unanswered; the figure provides no clues to its age, individuality, or character, while the gender of \"nu\" is male.\n\nThe painting combines elements of both the Cubist and Futurist movements. In the composition, Duchamp depicts motion by successive superimposed images, similar to stroboscopic motion photography. Duchamp also recognized the influence of the chronophotography of Étienne-Jules Marey and others, particularly Muybridge's \"Woman Walking Downstairs\" from his 1887 picture series, published as \"The Human Figure in Motion\".\n\nDuchamp submitted the work to appear with the Cubists at the 28th exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants, Paris, 25 March through 16 May 1912. It appeared under the number 1001 of the catalogue, entitled simply \"Nu descendant l'escalier\", not \"Nu descendant un escalier n° 2\". This catalogue revealed the title of the painting to the general public for the first time, even though the painting itself would be absent from the exhibition.\nDuchamp's brothers, Jacques Villon and Raymond Duchamp-Villon, sent by the hanging committee, asked him to voluntarily withdraw the painting, or paint over the title and rename it something else. According to Duchamp, Cubists such as Albert Gleizes found that his nude wasn't quite in line with what they had already investigated [tracée]. The hanging committee objected to the work, Duchamp stressed, on the grounds that it had \"too much of a literary title\", and that \"one doesn't paint a nude descending a staircase, that's ridiculous... a nude should be respected\".\nIt was also believed that the descending nude came too close to the influences of Italian Futurism. Although the Section d'Or Cubists tolerated and even enjoyed the presence of foreign artists (e.g., Constantin Brâncuși, František Kupka, Alexander Archipenko, Amedeo Modigliani and Joseph Csaky), the French Cubists kept the door firmly closed to the influence of foreign trends. During the month of February 1912, a large Futurist exhibition was held in Paris at the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune. Duchamp later denied the Futurist influence, claiming that the distance between Paris and Italy was too large for any tenable influences to occur.\n\nIn an interview with the museum curator Katherine Kuh, Marcel Duchamp spoke about his \"Nude Descending a Staircase\" and its relation to Futurism and the photographic motion studies of Muybridge and Marey:\nIn 1912 ... the idea of describing the movement of a nude coming downstairs while still retaining static visual means to do this, particularly interested me. The fact that I had seen chronophotographs of fencers in action and horse galloping (what we today call stroboscopic photography) gave me the idea for the \"Nude\". It doesn't mean that I copied these photographs. The Futurists were also interested in somewhat the same idea, though I was never a Futurist. And of course the motion picture with its cinematic techniques was developing then too. The whole idea of movement, of speed, was in the air.\n\nDuchamp later recalled of the relation between motion and his nude:\n\nMy aim was a static representation of movement, a static composition of indications of various positions taken by a form in movement—with no attempt to give cinema effects through painting. The reduction of a head in movement to a bare line seemed to me defensible.\n\nAnd with regard to the petition by the hanging committee of the Indépendants:\n\nI said nothing to my brothers. But I went immediately to the show and took my painting home in a taxi. It was really a turning point in my life, I can assure you. I saw that I would not be very much interested in groups after that.\n\nDespite the controversy—whether it was seen as such at the time or not—the work was shown with its original title at the \"Salon de la Section d'Or\", Galerie de la Boétie, October 1912, and with the same group of artists that exhibited at the Indépendants. His work also appeared in the illustrations to \"Du \"Cubisme\"\", and he participated in the \"La Maison Cubiste (Cubist House)\", organized by the designer André Mare for the Salon d'Automne of 1912 (a few months after the Indépendants). \"The impression is\", writes art historian Peter Brooke, \"it was precisely because he wished to remain part of the group that he withdrew the painting; and that, far from being ill treated by the group, he was given a rather privileged position, probably through the patronage of Picabia\".\n\nIt has been claimed (by others) that Duchamp never forgave his brothers and former colleagues for censoring his work.\n\nThe painting was exhibited for the first time at Galeries Dalmau, \"Exposició d'Art Cubista\", Barcelona, 1912. Duchamp subsequently submitted the painting to the 1913 Armory Show in New York City, where Americans, accustomed to naturalistic art, were scandalized. The painting, exhibited in the 'Cubist room', was submitted with the title \"Nu descendant un escalier\", was listed in the catalogue (no. 241) with the French title. A postcard printed for the occasion showed the painting for the first time with the English translation \"Nude Descending a Staircase\". Julian Street, an art critic for \"The New York Times\" wrote that the work resembled \"an explosion in a shingle factory,\" and cartoonists satirized the piece. It spawned dozens of parodies in the years that followed. A work entitled \"Food Descending a Staircase\" was exhibited at a show parodying the most outrageous works at the Armory, running concurrently with the show at The Lighthouse School for the Blind. In \"American Art News\", there were prizes offered to anyone who could find the nude.\n\nAfter attending the Armory Show and seeing Marcel Duchamp's nude, President Theodore Roosevelt wrote: \"Take the picture which for some reason is called 'A Naked Man Going Down Stairs'. There is in my bathroom a really good Navajo rug which, on any proper interpretation of the Cubist theory, is a far more satisfactory and decorative picture. Now, if, for some inscrutable reason, it suited somebody to call this rug a picture of, say, 'A Well-Dressed Man Going Up a Ladder', the name would fit the facts just about as well as in the case of the Cubist picture of the 'Naked Man Going Down Stairs'. From the standpoint of terminology each name would have whatever merit inheres in a rather cheap straining after effect; and from the standpoint of decorative value, of sincerity, and of artistic merit, the Navajo rug is infinitely ahead of the picture.\"\n\nDuring the Armory Show the painting was bought by the San Francisco lawyer and art dealer Frederic C. Torrey, who hung it in his home in Berkeley. In 1919, after commissioning a full-size copy of the work, Torrey sold the original to Louise and Walter Conrad Arensberg. In 1954 it entered the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art as a bequest from the Arensbergs. There it is displayed as part of the permanent collection alongside preliminary studies and a later copy by Duchamp.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the serial, the alien time traveller the Master (Anthony Ainley) attempts to use the power of the psychic gestalt being the Xeraphin to power his damaged time machine.\n\nThe Fifth Doctor, Nyssa, and Tegan, still mourning the loss of their former companion Adric, arrive at Heathrow and learn from Department C19 that one of their Concordes mysteriously vanished just before landing. Using another Concorde with the TARDIS aboard, the Doctor and his companions join Captain Stapley and his crew to fly the same landing path. They appear to land at Heathrow, but the Doctor determines they have flown through a time corridor to 140 million years in the past, the illusion of Heathrow projected by a powerful psychokinetic field.\n\nThe crew and passengers of the missing Concorde believe they are at Heathrow but are enslaved to work under guard of Plasmatons, humanoid blobs of protein held together by the psychokinetic field. One passenger, Professor Hayter, has seen through the illusion, and lets the Doctor know that they have been forced to work by the mystic Kalid to break into a central chamber at a nearby Citadel. As the Doctor sets off to see Kalid, Shapley and Hayter attempt to break the other humans free of the illusion, while Nyssa with her empathic abilities, is able to enter the central chamber freely along with Tegan to find the power source controlling the psychokinetic field. Nyssa briefly interrupts the power source, which causes Kalid's disguise to falter, revealing himself to the Doctor as the Master. The Master explains that he had been trapped in Earth's past after their last encounter, his own TARDIS damaged, and believed that he could repair it by acquiring the power source in the Citadel; he created the time corridor to obtain human slaves to help break the chamber open. However, now with the Doctor's TARDIS in his possession, the Master sets off in it to try to materialise in the central chamber.\n\nThe Doctor finds that the humans have finally broken through the chamber, and he soon joins Nyssa and Tegan inside. They find that the power source is a gestalt intelligence of numerous Xeraphin. Their ship had crashed some time ago, and to survive against high radiation levels, they took the form of energy in the gestalt. However, when the Master arrived, his presence caused the gestalt to develop a split personality, some willing to help the Master while others fighting against him. The Master is unable to materialise the Doctor's TARDIS into the chamber but instead uses it to create an induction loop to transfer the gestalt to his TARDIS. On returning to his TARDIS, he finds that Stapley and Hayter have take some of the key circuitry in their attempt to free the others, and he attempts to scavenge those parts from the Doctor's TARDIS. The Doctor proposes a truce, providing the spare parts including a temporal limiter, to repair the Master's TARDIS in exchange for dropping the psychokinetic field. The Master agrees, and quickly dematerialises when his TARDIS is ready. The Doctor ushers his companions and the freed humans to one of the Concordes, and uses his TARDIS to bring them back to the present at Heathrow. He reveals he programmed the temporal limiter to have the Master arrive later than they did, and thus is able to prevent the Master's TARDIS from rematerialising. Instead, as the Doctor had programmed, it will now rematerialise on the Xeraphin's home planet.\n\nAfter saying goodbye to Stapley and the rescued passengers, the Doctor and Nyssa leave. Tegan races out of the airport as the TARDIS vanishes, upset at being left behind.\n\nThe Concorde used for the production was G-BOAC, the flagship of the BA fleet at the time. The registry can be read from the radar screen in the ATC scenes. The other registry, G-BAVF, was not a Concorde, but a Beechcraft 58 twin-engined light executive aircraft\n\nAlthough his character had been killed in the previous episode, Matthew Waterhouse's contract extended into the filming of \"Time-Flight\", which is the reason for Adric's illusory appearance in Part Two. Tegan's apparent departure from the series was never intended to be permanent, but was planned as a sort of cliffhanger-ending to the 19th season. She would later return in the second episode of the next story, \"Arc of Infinity\".\n\nPeter Davison has claimed that \"Time-Flight\" was the biggest disappointment from his time on the series, stating it was a \"very good story, but we had run out of money. We filmed the prehistoric landscape of Heathrow airport in Studio 8 [at TV Centre] with a model Concorde in the back of the studio. The monsters were bits of foam. We didn't do the story justice.\"\n\nIn order to hide the Master's involvement in this story, the first episode did not credit Anthony Ainley as the Master. Instead, the credits and \"Radio Times\" listed \"Leon Ny Taiy\" (an anagram of \"Tony Ainley\") as playing Kalid. Keith Drinkel would later play Henry Hallam in the audio play \"Catch-1782\".\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Peter Grimwade, was published by Target Books in January 1983.\n\n\"Time-Flight\" was released on VHS in July 2000. A double-pack DVD featuring both \"Time-Flight\" and \"Arc of Infinity\" was released on 6 August 2007. This serial was released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 135 on 5 March 2014.\n"}

The school also offers a range of Advanced Placement classes including, but not limited to Biology, Physics, Chemistry, U.S. Government & Politics, American History, European History, Calculus AB, Calculus BC, Spanish V, French V, German V, English Literature and Composition, and English Language.\n\nCore courses are enhanced with a range of art, industrial art, instrumental and vocal music, drama, business, leadership, and technology. In addition to approximately 50 athletics programs, Heritage also offers about 30 other clubs and extracurricular activities to students.\n\nHeritage was the product of a 1988–89 merger between two former Saginaw Township high schools, Douglas MacArthur High School and Dwight D. Eisenhower High School. The new \"Heritage Hawks\" utilizes the old Eisenhower campus and selected one color from each of its parent schools; its official colors are now navy blue and Kelly green. The original logo of the Heritage Hawks had a hawk above HH with a chain looping down around the HH. The chain links were 8s—signifying the year the new school was established: 1988.\n\nProviding an alternative High School Completion program, Mackinaw's curriculum is geared toward success in the Certificate Programs at nearby Delta College. Mackinaw is open to all students in the county ages 14–19 who have struggled with traditional high school (attendance, motivation problems) or who have dropped out of school and are looking for a second chance to earn a high school diploma. The school's flexible schedule can students achieve progress based upon proficiencies and their own motivation to succeed.\n\nPlainfield was an elementary school within the district which was closed in 2011. The school's campus is now used for Mackinaw High School.\n\nDouglas MacArthur High School and Dwight D. Eisenhower High School were merged in 1988 to create Heritage High School. The Eisenhower campus went on to be used by the new high school, while the MacArthur campus became home to White Pine Middle School.\n\n"}

They are composed of large amounts of extracellular matrix containing collagen, fibronectin, and proteoglycan. Collagen type I and type III are abundant, but the collagen fibrils are formed abnormally.\nThe presence of myomas is related with fertility. The presence of submucous myomas decreases fertility, and their removal increases fertility to baseline rates. Neither intramural nor subserosal myomas appear to affect fertility rates, and their removal has not been shown to increase fertility.\nMyomas in pregnancy can affect myoma growth, dependent on individual differences in genetics, circulating growth factors, and myoma-localized receptors. However, most myomas do not increase in size during pregnancy. Morover, 5% of myomas degenerates during pregnancy. \nThey are of two types. \nClinically significant subserosal and intramural myomas can usually be diagnosed by pelvic examination based on findings of an enlarged, irregularly shaped uterus. However, the optimal selection of patients for medical therapy, noninvasive procedures, or surgery depends on an accurate assessment of the size, number, and position of myomas. The techniques available for confirming the diagnosis of myomas include sonography, saline-infusion sonography, hysteroscopy, and MRI.\nTransvaginal sonography is the most readily available and least costly technique and may be helpful for differentiating myomas from other pelvic conditions.\nSaline-infusion sonography uses saline inserted into the uterine cavity to provide contrast and better define submucous myomas, polyps, endometrial hyperplasia, or carcinoma. Magnetic resonance imagine is an excellent method to evaluate the size, position, and number of uterine myomas and is the best modality for exact evaluation of submucous myoma penetration into the myometrium.\nMagnetic resonance imaging may differentiate adenomyosis from myomas. \n\nTo remove the tumor from the body, a myomectomy or hysterectomy is often required, depending on the site and type of myoma.\n"}

Chisholm played as a central defender for Sunderland, Hibernian, Dundee and Partick Thistle.\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Chisholm became a coach, working in some of his roles as assistant to Ian McCall. Chisholm succeeded McCall as manager of Dundee United in 2005, and guided the club to the 2005 Scottish Cup Final, which they lost 1–0 to Celtic. He was sacked the following season, however, and was subsequently appointed manager of Scottish First Division club Queen of the South. Chisholm guided the club to the 2008 Scottish Cup Final, which they lost 3–2 to Rangers. Chisholm left Queens in 2010 to manage Dundee, but was made redundant when the club went into administration in October 2010.\n\nChisholm started his career at Sunderland where he spent seven years and was a member of the side that reached the final of the Football League Cup in March 1985, where they lost 1–0 to Norwich City. Unfortunately for Chisholm, he deflected Asa Hartford's shot into the net for Norwich's winning goal.\n\nChisholm moved back to Scotland later that year, when he joined Hibernian for a £60,000 fee. He scored a goal on his Hibs debut, a Scottish League Cup semi-final win against Rangers. This meant that Chisholm achieved the unusual feat of playing in League Cup Finals in the same calendar year in both England and Scotland. Unfortunately for Chisholm, both finals were lost, as Hibs lost 3–0 to Aberdeen. He later had spells at Dundee and Partick Thistle before retiring in 1992. Chisholm was a \"tall, commanding central defender\" who \"could also play in the holding midfield role\".\n\nChisholm had assistant manager roles at Partick Thistle, Clydebank, Ross County, Airdrie, Falkirk and Dundee United, primarily working with Ian McCall.\n\nChisholm was appointed as caretaker manager of Dundee United on 14 March 2005, following the sacking of Ian McCall. Chisholm suffered 3–2 defeats against both Celtic and Hibernian in his first two matches in charge. The following week, however, Chisholm's team triumphed over Hibernian, Rangers and Hearts. United then went on to end a run of eight games over three years without a win against neighbours Dundee, with goals by Mark Wilson and Jim McIntyre sealing a 2–1 win. These results meant that Chisholm won the SPL manager of the month award in his first full month in charge of the team (April 2005). Chisholm's team then retained SPL status in dramatic style with a late Barry Robson penalty at Inverness on the final day of the season.\n\nUnited's victory against Hibs meant that they reached the 2005 Scottish Cup Final, which they lost 1–0 against Celtic. As Celtic had already qualified for the UEFA Champions League, however, United qualified for the UEFA Cup. Chisholm was given the position of manager on a permanent basis on 24 May 2005. Despite spending considerable money on players such as Lee Miller, Dundee United were eliminated in the qualifying stage of the UEFA Cup by Finnish team MyPa. Poor league form and a 3–2 defeat against Aberdeen in the third round of the Scottish Cup, after having led 2–0, led to Chisholm being sacked on 10 January 2006 by Dundee United chairman Eddie Thompson.\n\nChisholm again became Ian McCall's assistant, this time at Dumfries club Queen of the South, until McCall's departure from the club at the end of the 2006–07 season. Chisholm then accepted the role as manager, appointing Kenny Brannigan as his assistant manager. Chairman Davie Rae also announced that the club would become fully professional that season. In March 2008, Chisholm guided Queens to only their second ever Scottish Cup semi-final appearance with a 2–0 quarter final victory against Dundee, a game notable for a goal from 84 yards by Ryan McCann. Queens followed this with a 4–3 win against Aberdeen in the semi-final, which meant that Chisholm had guided Queens to their first ever Scottish Cup Final appearance. Despite second half Queens goals by Steve Tosh and Jim Thomson, Rangers ran out 3–2 winners in the Final. Queens finished fourth in the Scottish First Division.\n\nAs Rangers had already qualified for the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League through their league position, Queens entered the 2008–09 UEFA Cup competition. They were drawn in a qualification round against Danish club FC Nordsjælland. The first leg, hosted at the Excelsior Stadium in Airdrie, was played in a quagmire with the Danes running out 2–1 winners. Queens delivered a stronger performance in the return leg, controlling most of the game but with only one goal to show for their superiority. With a 1–0 victory of no value in an aggregate result due to the away goals rule and Queens pushing all out for the second goal, the Danes took advantage to score two goals in the last five minutes. Chisholm's team selection for the UEFA Cup ties caused some surprise. With Stephen Dobbie the most prolific striker at the club in a generation, Chisholm started with Dobbie on the bench for both ties instead preferring the workmanlike Stewart Kean.\n\nA strong start to the 2008–09 league campaign saw the club sitting top of the table in October. At the same time, Chisholm was linked with the vacant position at Dundee, but Davie Rae refused Chisholm permission to talk to the \"Dark Blues\". This coincided with Queens losing form, as they gained only three draws from the next 12 games placing them only one place above bottom. Their form improved in the latter part of the season and the club finished in mid-table.\n\nThe 2009–10 season progressed in a similar fashion to the season before. Queens were top of the table, but poorer results followed that dragged the club into a mid table position. The club also suffered a 4–0 defeat in the Scottish Cup against Airdrie. Chisholm applied for the vacant managerial position at Kilmarnock, but the job was taken by Jimmy Calderwood. Two months later, Chisholm was offered the vacant position at Dundee. Chisholm made the following comments after leaving QoS:\n\nChisholm took the Dundee job while they were top of the First Division, although the club had just sacked Jocky Scott after going four games without a win. Chisholm said ahead of his first game in charge, \"It was an opportunity I just couldn't pass by at my time of life, but it will be a strange experience being on opposite sides tomorrow night.\" Chisholm was the first person to manage both major Dundee clubs. Billy Dodds, who was the Queen of the South strikers coach under Chisholm, joined him at Dens Park as his assistant.\n\nDundee failed to win promotion at the end of the 2009–10 season and entered administration a few months later. The administrator made Chisholm and Dodds redundant the following day.\n\nAfter leaving Dundee in October 2010 and spending over a year out of professional football, Chisholm set up an estate agent business with his wife. In March 2012, Chisholm was appointed assistant manager of East Fife by Gordon Durie on a part-time basis. After Durie took ill during a game, Chisholm took control of the team. He resigned from his position at East Fife in October 2012 due to the pressures of combining both tasks and commuting from Lenzie to Methil. Chisholm was then appointed as international development coach with Sunderland.\n\n"}

In 1916, the first public transportation to the school was provided by horse-drawn wagon. The name was changed to Manchester District High School in 1924, with the first graduating class, in 1925, consisting of eight students. Rapid population growth, following World War II, required that new facilities be built, and in fall 1964 the school was moved to 7401 Hull Street Road (now Manchester Middle School). Westward urban sprawl from the nearby city of Richmond, Virginia, required yet another move in 1992 to the current location at 12601 Bailey Bridge Road.\n\nManchester shares many of its facilities with the adjacent Bailey Bridge Middle School. It is home to Lloyd Swelnis Stadium, named after the long-time Manchester athletic director. In 2003 closed-circuit cameras were installed in the building and parking lots to provide better security for students and staff. An addition to the main building was completed in 2004 to house the Mass Communications and Spanish-Immersion Specialty Centers.\n\nManchester High School has a diverse student body, consisting of approximately 1900 students, and is reflective of the multiple ethnicities present in Chesterfield County. The opening of Cosby High School in 2006, and the new location and recreation of Clover Hill High School has alleviated the over-crowding at Manchester High, allowing for the reduction in number of trailers previously used as classrooms.\n\nSports teams include baseball, basketball, football, cheerleading, volleyball, soccer, softball, field hockey, track and field, cross-country, tennis, wrestling, and golf. Notable clubs include a JROTC program, Foreign Language clubs, school news paper, Model UN, show choir, marching band, Red Cross and cheering.

The party was formed in May 1972 by the merger of three black power organizations based in Florida and Kentucky. Omali Yeshitela, one of the original co-founders, leads the APSP as of 2019.\n\nThe APSP's stated goals are \"to keep the Black Power Movement alive, defend the countless Africans locked up by the counterinsurgency, and develop relationships with Africa and Africans worldwide\".\n\nThe APSP was founded in 1972 — emerging from three earlier Black organisations in Florida, namely: the Junta of Militant Organizations (JOMO), the Black Rights Fighters, and the Black Study Group. JOMO, the most influential of the three organisations then led by Yeshitela, was a Black organisation protesting against racial discrimination, and racist police brutality and abuses against people of African descent in Florida, United States. Omali Yeshitela, who was then the chairman of JOMO also founded APSP in 1972 and became its chairman. According to Klehr, the APSP styles its members as \"true, genuine communists.\" That same year (1972), the APSP adopted the oldest Black Power newspaper in the U.S. — The Burning Spear Newspaper as its official publication.\n\nThe APSP established the African People's Solidarity Committee (APSC) in 1976. The APSC is a Euro-American/European people organisation \"that works in solidarity with the struggle for African liberation and the unification of Africa and African people worldwide.\" The role of the APSC is to raise funds through donor campaigns and economic development campaigns operated by the APSP. In defense of this controversial move/organisation which is contrary to the true spirit of Pan-Africanism, the APSP \"argues that it forms a revolutionary force within the white community and that its campaigns enabled the Black revolution to reclaim stolen resources.\"\n\nIn September 1979, the party founded the African National Prison Organization (ANPO) following a 4 September 1977 meeting in Atlanta, Georgia. Several nationalist organisations attended that meeting where the importance of, and the need for developing greater unity between pro-independence forces were established. It was decided that the ANPO \"would be the gateway to building a national liberation front. Additionally, the participants at the meeting established five principles as the basis for forming the ANPO, which were self-determination, political independence, anti-imperialism, anticolonialism, and self-defense.\"\n\nIn 1981, the party moved its national office to Oakland, California, and opened the Uhuru house. The first party congress was held in Oakland in 1982. At that congress, the party passed a resolution to create the African Socialist International (ASI) organization. The ASI sought to be the \"international party of the African working class\", and has held conferences in various countries outside the United States.\n\nThe APSP also founded the African National Reparations Organization in 1982, and the First World Tribunal on Reparations for African People was held in Brooklyn, New York. On its official website, the APSP claims that \"through this work, the African People's Socialist Party gave birth to the modern Reparations Movement.\" Martin and Yaquinto however posits that, in the National Black Political Assembly's (NBPA) \"Black Agenda\" report published in 1974, the NBPA \"endorsed the concept of African American reparations.\" Citing Hakim (Hakim, I. T., \"Reparations, the Cure for America's Race Problem.\" Hampton. Va.; U.B. and U.S. Communication System, 1994), the authors however went on to write that: \"The African National Reparations Organization linked to the African People's Socialist Party has conducted yearly tribunals on U.S. racism since 1982 and demanded $4.1 trillion in reparations for stolen labor.\" That financial reparation was initially demanded at the First World Tribunal on Reparations for African People's 1982 meeting, which concluded that, \"the United States owned $4.1 trillion for the crime of genocide against African Americans and the unpaid labor provided by them and their descendants during the period of slavery.\" The stated objective of the movement is to obtain compensation for the injustices of slavery, as well as segregation and neocolonialism since then.\n\nIn the mid 1990s, the party's national office moved back to St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\nOn December 11, 2017, Omali Yeshitela announced that controversial YouTuber Gazi Kodzo would become the Secretary General of the African People's Socialist Party. In January, it was claimed by the party that Gazi Kodzo was removed from the position and expelled from the party on November 18, 2018 for disciplinary reasons following a vote. Kodzo and other former party members who also recently split from the party deny being removed. In his video records, Kodzo claims he chose to leave the party (see the external links heading for his video responses), and upon learning this the party then issued the statement that Kodzo had been disciplinarily ejected.\n\n"}

{"id": "2098301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2098301", "title": "Makassan contact with Australia", "text": "Makassan contact with Australia\n\nMakassar people from the region of Sulawesi (modern-day Indonesia) began visiting the coast of northern Australia sometime around the middle of the 1700s, first in the Kimberley region, and some decades later in Arnhem Land. They were men who collected and processed \"trepang\" (also known as sea cucumber), a marine invertebrate sea cucumber prized for its culinary value generally and for its medicinal properties in Chinese markets. The term Makassan (or Macassan) is generally used to apply to all the trepangers who came to Australia. Some were from other islands in the Indonesian Archipelago, including Timor, Rote and Aru.\n\nThe creature and the food product are commonly known in English as sea cucumber, \"bêche-de-mer\" in French, \"gamat\" in Malay, while Makassarese has 12 terms covering 16 different species. One of the Makassar terms, for trepang, \"taripaŋ\", entered the Aboriginal languages of the Cobourg Peninsula, as \"tharriba\" in Marrku, as \"jarripang\" in Mawng or otherwise as \"darriba.\"\n\n\"Trepang\" live on the sea floor and are exposed at low tide. Fishing was traditionally done by hand, spearing, diving or dredging. The catch was placed in boiling water before being dried and smoked, to preserve the \"trepang\" for the journey back to Makassar and other South East Asian markets. \"Trepang\" is still valued by Chinese communities for its jelly-like texture, its flavour-enhancing properties, and as a stimulant and aphrodisiac. Matthew Flinders made a contemporary record of how trepang was processed when he met Pobasso, a chief of a Makassan fleet in February 1803.\n\nFishing fleets began to visit the northern coasts of Australia from Makassar in southern Sulawesi, Indonesia, from at least 1720 and possibly earlier. Campbell Macknight's classic study of the Makassan trepang industry accepts the start of the industry as about 1720, with the earliest recorded trepang voyage made in 1751. But Regina Ganter of Griffith University notes that a Sulawesi historian suggests a commencement date for the industry of about 1640. Ganter also notes that for some anthropologists, the extensive influence of the trepang industry on the Yolngu people suggests a longer period of contact. Arnhem land Aboriginal rock art, recorded by archaeologists in 2008, appears to provide further evidence of Makassan contact in the mid-1600s. Based on radiocarbon dating for apparent \"prau\" (boat) designs in Aboriginal rock art, some scholars have proposed contact from as early as the 1500s.\n\nAt the height of the trepang industry, the Makassan ranged thousands of kilometres along Australia's northern coasts, arriving with the north-west monsoon each December. Makassan \"perahu\" or \"praus\" could carry a crew of thirty members, and Macknight estimated the total number of trepangers arriving each year as about one thousand. The Makassan crews established themselves at various semi-permanent locations on the coast, to boil and dry the trepang before the return voyage home, four months later, to sell their cargo to Chinese merchants. \"Marege\"' was the Makassan name for Arnhem land (meaning \"Wild Country\"), from the Cobourg Peninsula to Groote Eylandt in the Gulf of Carpentaria. \"Kayu Jawa\" was the name for the fishing grounds in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, from Napier Broome Bay to Cape Leveque. Other important fishing areas included West Papua, Sumbawa, Timor and Selayar. \n\nMatthew Flinders, in his circumnavigation of Australia in 1803, met a Makassan trepang fleet near present-day Nhulunbuy. He communicated at length with a Makassan captain, Pobasso, through his cook, who was also a Malay, and learned of the extent of the trade from this encounter. Ganter writes: \"1,000 Macassans...must have seen a veritable invasion against the fewer than 7,000 British nestled into Sydney Cove and Newcastle.\" Nicholas Baudin also encountered 26 large \"perahu\" off the northern coast of Western Australia in the same year. \n\nThe British settlements of Fort Dundas and Fort Wellington were established as a result of Phillip Parker King's contact with Makassan trepangers in 1821.\n\n\"Using Daeng Rangka\", the last Makassan trepanger to visit Australia, lived well into the 20th century, and the history of his voyages are well documented. He first made the voyage to northern Australia as a young man. He suffered dismasting and several shipwrecks, and had generally positive but occasionally conflicting relationships with Indigenous Australians. He was the first trepanger to pay the South Australian government for a trepanging licence in 1883, an impost that made the trade less viable. (At the time this jurisdiction administered the Northern Territory.) The trade continued to dwindle toward the end of the 19th century, due to the imposition of customs duties and licence fees and probably compounded by overfishing. Rangka commanded the last Makassar \"perahu\", which left Arnhem Land in 1907.\n\nArcheological remains of Makassar processing plants from the 18th and 19th centuries are still at Port Essington, Anuru Bay and Groote Eylandt, along with stands of the tamarind trees introduced by the Makassan. Macknight and others note that excavations and development in these areas have revealed pieces of metal, broken pottery and glass, coins, fishhooks and broken clay pipes related to this trade. Macknight notes that much of the ceramic material found suggests a nineteenth-century date.\n\nIn 1916, two bronze cannons were found on a small island in Napier Broome Bay, on the northern coast of Western Australia. Scientists at the Western Australian Museum in Fremantle have made a detailed analysis and have determined that these weapons are swivel guns and almost certainly of late-18th-century Makassan, rather than European, origin. Flinders' account confirms that the Makassans he met were personally armed and their perahus carried small cannons.\n\nIn January 2012, a swivel gun found two years before at Dundee Beach near Darwin was widely reported by web news sources and the Australian press to be of Portuguese origin. However initial analysis by the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory indicates it is probably also of South East Asian origin. The Museum holds seven guns of South East Asian manufacture in its collections. Another swivel gun of South East Asian manufacture, found in Darwin in 1908, is held by the Museum of South Australia, and is also possibly of Makassan origin.\n\nThere is significant evidence of contact with Makassan fishers in examples of rock art and bark painting of northern Australia, with the Makassan \"perahu\" a prominent feature.\n\nThe Wurrwurrwuy stone arrangements at Yirrkala, which are listed as heritage monuments, depict aspects of Makassan trepanging, including details of the vessels' internal structures.\n\nThe Makassar contact with Aborigines had a significant effect on the latter culture, and likely there were also cross-cultural influences. Ganter writes \"the cultural imprint on the Yolngu people of this contact is everywhere: in their language, in their art, in their stories, in their cuisine.\" According to anthropologist John Bradley from Monash University, the contact between the two groups was a success: \"They traded together. It was fair - there was no racial judgement, no race policy.\" Even into the early 21st century, the shared history between the two peoples is still celebrated by Aboriginal communities in northern Australia as a period of mutual trust and respect.\n\nOthers who have studied this period have come to a different conclusion regarding the relationship between the aboriginal people and the visiting trepangers. Anthropologist Ian McIntosh has said that the initial effects of contact with the Macassan fishermen resulted in \"turmoil\" with the extent of Islamic influence being noteworthy. In another paper McIntosh concludes, \"strife, poverty and domination... is a previously unrecorded legacy of contact between Aborigines and Indonesians.\" A report prepared by the History Department of the Australian National University says that the Macassan appear to have been welcomed initially; however, relations deteriorated when, \"aborigines began to feel they were being exploited... leading to violence on both sides\".\n\nStudies by anthropologists have found traditions that indicate the Makassan negotiated with local people on the Australian continent for the right to fish certain waters. The exchange also involved the trade of cloth, tobacco, metal axes and knives, rice, and gin. The Yolgnu of Arnhem Land also traded turtle-shell, pearls and cypress pine, and some were employed as trepangers. While there is ample evidence of peaceful contact, some contact was hostile. Using Daeng Rangka described at least one violent confrontation with Aborigines, while Flinders recorded being advised by the Makassan to \"beware of the natives\". \n\nSome of the rock art and bark paintings appear to confirm that some Aboriginal workers willingly accompanied the Makassar back to their homeland of South Sulawesi, Indonesia across the Arafura Sea. Women were also occasional items of exchange according to Denise Russell, but their views and experiences have not been recorded. After visiting Groote Eylandt in the early 1930s, anthropologist Donald Thomson speculated that the traditional seclusion of women from strange men and their use of a portable bark screens in this region \"may have been a result of contact with Macassans\".\n\nSmallpox may have been introduced to northern Australia in the 1820s via Makassan contact. This remains unproven as First Fleet smallpox was already recorded as spreading across Australia from Sydney Cove. The prevalence of the hereditary Machado-Joseph disease in the Groote Eylandt community has been attributed to outside contact. Recent genetic studies showed that the Groote Eylandt families with MJD shared a Y-DNA haplogroup with some families of Taiwanese, Indian, and Japanese ancestry.\n\nSome Yolngu communities of Arnhem Land appear to have re-figured their economies from being largely land-based to largely sea-based, following the introduction of Makassar technologies such as dug-out canoes, which were highly prized. These seaworthy boats, unlike the traditional Yolngu bark canoes, allowed the people to fish the ocean for dugongs and sea turtles. Macknight notes that both the dug-out canoe and shovel-nosed spear found in Arnhem Land were based on Macassarese prototypes.\n\nA Makassan pidgin became a lingua franca along the north coast, not just between Makassan and Aboriginal people, but also as a language of trade among different Aboriginal groups, who were brought into greater contact with each other by the seafaring Makassar culture. Words from the Makassarese language (related to Javanese and Indonesian) can still be found in Aboriginal language varieties of the north coast. Examples include \"rupiah\" (money), \"jama\" (work), and \"balanda\" (white person). The latter was adopted into the Makassar language via the Malay language term \"\"orang belanda\"\" (referring to Dutch person).\n\nDrawing on the work of Ian Mcintosh (2000), Regina Ganter and Peta Stephenson suggest that aspects of Islam were creatively adapted by the Yolngu. Muslim references still survive in certain ceremonies and Dreaming stories in the early 21st century. Stephenson speculates that the Makassan may have been the first visitors to bring Islam to Australia.\n\nAccording to anthropologist John Bradley from Monash University, \"If you go to north-east Arnhem Land there is [a trace of Islam] in song, it is there in painting, it is there in dance, it is there in funeral rituals. It is patently obvious that there are borrowed items. With linguistic analysis as well, you're hearing hymns to Allah, or at least certain prayers to Allah.\"\n\nThough prevented from fishing across Arnhem Land, other Indonesian fishermen have continued to fish up and down the west coast, in what are now Australian waters. This continues a practice of several hundred years, before such territories were declared — and some use traditional boats that their grandparents owned. The current Australian government considered such fishing illegal by its rules. Since the 1970s, if the fishermen are caught by authorities, their boats are burned and the fishermen are deported to Indonesia. Most Indonesian fishing in Australian waters now occurs around what Australia coined \"Ashmore Reef\" (known in Indonesia as \"Pulau Pasir\") and the nearby islands.\n\n\n"}

He served as Vatican Secretary of State from 1961 to 1969, and Dean of the College of Cardinals from 1972 until his death. Cicognani was elevated to the cardinalate in 1958. His brother, Gaetano Cicognani, was also a cardinal. To date they are the last pair of brothers to serve together in the College of Cardinals.\n\nAmleto Cicognani was born in Brisighella, near Faenza, as the younger of the two children of Guglielmo and Anna (née Ceroni) Cicognani. His widowed mother ran a general store to support him and his brother, Gaetano. After studying at the seminary in Faenza, he was ordained a priest on 23 September 1905 by Bishop Gioacchino Cantagalli. Cicognani continued his studies at the Pontifical Roman Athenaeum \"S. Apollinare\", and in 1910 he was appointed an official of the Sacred Congregation for the Discipline of the Sacraments. First raised to the rank of Monsignor in 1917, he taught at his alma mater of the Athenaeum \"S. Apollinare\" from 1921 to 1932, and then entered the Roman Curia, as substitute adjunct of the Consistorial, on 16 December 1922.\n\nAfter holding a variety of pastoral and curial positions, Cicognani was appointed Apostolic Delegate to the United States and Titular Archbishop of \"Laodicea in Phrygia\" on 17 March 1933. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 23 April from Cardinal Raffaele Rossi, with Archbishops Giuseppe Pizzardo and Carlo Salotti serving as co-consecrators, in the Roman church of Santa Susanna. Cicognani would remain Apostolic Delegate to the United States, serving as liaison between the American hierarchy and the Vatican, for the next 25 years.\n\nDuring World War II, Cicognani expressed reservations about Zionism. In a letter dated 22 June 1943 to American representative Myron C. Taylor, he said: \"It is true that at one time Palestine was inhabited by the Hebrew Race, but there is no axiom in history to substantiate the necessity of a people returning to a country they left nineteen centuries before …… If a 'Hebrew Home' is desired, it would not be too difficult to find a more fitting territory than Palestine. With an increase in the Jewish population there, grave, new international problems would arise.\"\n\nHe was created Cardinal-Priest of S. Clemente by Pope John XXIII in the consistory of 15 December 1958. Cardinal Cicognani was later raised to Cardinal-Bishop of Frascati on 23 May 1962. Because his brother, Gaetano, was already a living cardinal, having been elevated in 1953, an exception had to be made to the Church law that prohibited brothers from holding the title of cardinal simultaneously.\n\nOn 14 November 1959, Cicognani became Secretary of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches. He was later named to the posts of Cardinal Secretary of State, President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, and President of the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See on 12 August 1961. With the appointments of 1962, Cicognani essentially became the foreign minister, prime minister, and interior minister of the Vatican.\n\nHe attended the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965), at which he served as Chairman of the Secretariat for Extraordinary Questions. Cicognani was also one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1963 papal conclave, which selected Pope Paul VI.\n\nOn 30 April 1969, Cicognani resigned all of his posts. However, on 24 March 1972, he was elected and confirmed as Dean of the College of Cardinals and thus received the title of the suburbicarian see of Ostia, in addition to his title of Cardinal Bishop of Frascati.\n\nCicognani died in Rome, following a brief illness, at age 90. He is buried in the Basilica di San Clemente.\n\nHe was considered to be rather conservative in his views. He sought to stem ecumenism in the Catholic Church in America, and was once described as not being open to Aggiornamento.\n\n \n"}

{"id": "2098344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2098344", "title": "A Wilhelm Scream", "text": "A Wilhelm Scream\n\nA Wilhelm Scream (abbreviated as AWS) is a melodic hardcore band from New Bedford, Massachusetts formed in 1999. Many people have referenced Strung Out, Hot Water Music, Propagandhi, and Strike Anywhere as the band's similar artists. Their name is a reference to the Wilhelm scream, a famous stock sound effect which is mainly used in films. The band previously went by the names Koen, Adam's Crack, and Smackin' Isaiah, though the last was the only name to be used in any major releases. \"The reason for the name changes from Koen to Smackin' Isaiah, then to A Wilhelm Scream was really a matter of them adding new members, and progressing/maturing as a band\".\n\nIn 1993, drummer Trevor Reilly, guitarist John Carvalho and bassist Jonathan Teves formed the band Adam's Crack and recorded a Nirvana-inspired demo cassette. In 1994 Reilly and Carvalho started a side band with Nuno Pereira on vocals, and others. The side band played one show before disbanding. Members from the two bands would merge into one, taking the name Koen. The line-up of Koen consisted of Pereira (vocals), Reilly (drums), Teves (bass), Carvalho (guitar) and friend Mat Demelo (guitar and trumpet). Under the name Koen, the band released one cassette titled \"The Big Fall...\", this time with their sound evolving more into skate punk and ska. In 1997, the band changed its name again, this time to Smackin' Isaiah, and released a cassette titled \"Give Girls More Beer...\". Mat Demelo left the band shortly after. During this time, Reilly would switch between drumming and guitar duties, with an unknown drummer playing in the band for a brief amount of time. Nicholas Angelini was eventually tapped to play drums on a permanent basis. In 1998, Smackin' Isaiah released another demo cassette, titled \"Gets Eaten Alive\".\n\nThe band's first CD release was on Tank Records, a record label created by Carvalho and Teves. The CD was a split release with the bands Moronique and Merrick, entitled \"\" after the number of tracks each band contributed. Soon after, the band released its debut album, \"The Way to a Girl's Heart Is Through Her Boyfriend's Stomach\". The band considers this their first \"real\" release, as all the songs had been written after Angelini joined the band. In retrospect, they consider it their most cheerful record. It was reissued 2 years later on All About Records, but the band stayed with Tank Records to release its second album, \"Benefits Of Thinking Out Loud\". During the album's recording, the band members had a strained relationship as they argued over its production. Six outtakes from the album's recording sessions were compiled onto an EP entitled \"The Champagne of Bands... We Know Sexy\" released by Fork in Hand Records. Following its release, Carvalho left the band. Christopher Levesque quickly replaced him.\n\nWith the band taking a more serious approach on \"Benefits\", they decided to once more change their name, finally settling on A Wilhelm Scream. Signing with new label Jump Start Records, they re-released \"Benefits of Thinking Out Loud\" under their new name. After touring the United States and Canada a few times, they then began recording their next album, \"Mute Print\", with Jump Start. For the recording of the album, the band decided to put \"as much shit as you can possibly fit into a song and pull off live\" into the songs, to which they attribute their faster, more aggressive and more technical sound. This album was recorded and produced by Descendents drummer Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore, whom the band looked up to. Although the album was finished while the band was signed to Jump Start, the rights to the album were then bought by Nitro Records, who released it in 2004.\n\nOnly a year after \"Mute Print\", the band released a second record on Nitro, again produced by Stevenson and Livermore. The record, entitled \"Ruiner\", was released on August 16, 2005. Following stress from touring, founding member Jonathan Teves left the band, and was replaced by bassist Curtiss Lopez. They then embarked on their first European tour with Lagwagon, and also toured with Less Than Jake. Midway through the latter tour, Lopez abruptly quit the band. This left A Wilhelm Scream without a permanent bassist until Brian J. Robinson, former bassist of The Fullblast in April. The band continued to tour extensively throughout 2006. They also released a 7-inch EP titled \"Diver\" on Jump Start Records. This was because the title track was recorded during the Mute Print sessions, but left off the album, and thus was not purchased by Nitro Records.\n\nIn 2007, the band returned to the Blasting Room again, with Stevenson and Livermore to record their third album with Nitro Records. The record, according to the band, was \"very very fast\" and a few songs were dropped for not being fast enough. The record, \"Career Suicide\", was released on October 9, 2007. However, only two weeks before its street date, long-time guitarist Chris Levesque announced that he was leaving the band, elaborating with the following statement:\n\n\"I have maintained for the duration of my time in Smackin' Isaiah/A Wilhelm Scream that when it stopped being fun, I would give it up. The bottom line here is that I just don't enjoy the day-in, day-out grind of being on tour anymore... There are no personal or creative differences between any of us. None of that bullshit. I still love this band and everything it stands for. The six years that I've spent in SI/AWS have been the best of my life. We've accomplished more than I ever expected, and I take with me with more amazing memories than most people experience in a lifetime.\n\nThe band began their tour in support of \"Career Suicide\" with several rotating guitarists, before Mike Supina, formerly of the Detroit-based band Alucard, was announced as Levesque's permanent replacement. The tour brought the band to over eighteen different countries, finishing in September 2008. Following its conclusion, guitarist Trevor Reilly announced in his blog that the band would take a break for the rest of the year, but implied that they would write new songs soon. In a post to celebrate the new year, the band released b-side \"The I Hate ___ Club\", which was left off the album at the producers' request. The band were also demoing new songs.\n\nIn June 2009, the band signed to Paper + Plastick while working on a new album. Their first release for the label was a 5-song self-titled EP, mixed by Matt Bayles, released on November 20, 2009.\n\nIn July 2010, the band returned to the studio to write and record their next studio album. A release date was expected sometime in 2010. They took a break from recording in September, however, to support Comeback Kid in their Canadian tour for their upcoming fourth studio album. They returned to the studio when their performing dates were complete. The band recorded the album themselves, in their own studio with all the mixing once again being done by the crew at The Blasting Room. While touring South America in November 2012 they announced that the next album would be released in spring 2013.\n\nOn November 5, 2013 the band released \"Partycrasher\" via No Idea Records. It was produced and engineered by Trevor J. Reilly and Mike Supina at Black & Blue Studio in New Bedford, MA \n\nIn an interview on August 18, 2015, the band confirmed that they have already started writing on a follow up to 'Partycrasher'. During their summer European tour of 2018, Trevor confirmed the band would enter the studio in early 2019 to record a new album. \n\nLead guitarist Mike Supina left the band after finishing up A Wilhem Scream's touring commitments in 2018, ending his ten year run. The band has played shows with a mix of lineups in 2019; Mute Print and Ruiner anniversary shows with former guitarist Chris Levesque and shows with songs from the self titled EP and Partycrasher with Senses Fail guitarist Jason Milbank. A Wilhelm Scream has mostly focused on local shows and some large festival dates in Europe, Canada, and the United States in 2019, focusing primarily on completing on Trevor Reilly's long awaited studio/band HQ and demoing new song ideas. Both Nuno and Trevor say their goal is to release an album sometime in 2020.\n\nIn February of 2020 the band announced their first tour in over a year, a United States East Coast tour in support of Millencolin.\n\n\n\n\n"}
