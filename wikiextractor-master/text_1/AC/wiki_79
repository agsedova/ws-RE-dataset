{"id": "2156009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156009", "title": "Football in Belgium", "text": "Football in Belgium\n\nFootball, a sport which has been played in Belgium since the end of the 19th century, is the country's most popular sport. The national association was founded in 1895 with the intention of bringing some order and organization to the sport. The first match of the Belgium national team was played on 1 May 1904, a 3–3 draw against France.\n\nTraditionally, the clubs Anderlecht, Club Brugge and Standard Liège are the three most dominant domestic teams, all of them also having played and/or won one or more European Cup final(s). Except for Standard Liège and Charleroi, most professional clubs have Flemish backgrounds.\n\nBoth the national football team and the top Belgium division have a reputation for physical play. This came as a result of a lack of technically skilled foreign players allowed to play in Belgium due to legal restrictions. This changed after the Bosman ruling which forced the liberalization of the football player market in Europe. In response, Belgian clubs began to buy unknown players from Eastern Europe, South America and Africa. This had two contradictory consequences. On the one hand, the national team was weakened by the reduced opportunity for native Belgium players to gain a spot on domestic teams. On the other hand, the Jupiler League reinforced its status as an entry league for players who then move on to some of the greatest European clubs.\n\nIndeed, some of the most talented players in Europe have played in Belgian clubs, including Yaya Touré, Jean-Pierre Papin, Daniel Amokachi, Antolín Alcaraz and David Rozehnal were discovered at Club Brugge; Sunday Oliseh and Victor Ikpeba at RFC Liège; Jan Koller, Nii Lamptey and Aruna Dindane at Anderlecht; and Mido at Gent.\n\nOthers who began or launched their professional careers in Belgium include William Carvalho, Emmanuel Eboué, Romaric, Gervinho, Didier Zokora, Arthur Boka, Ivica Dragutinović, Mario Stanić, Morten Olsen, Dorinel Munteanu, André Cruz, Seol Ki-hyeon, Kennet Andersson, Klas Ingesson, Aaron Mokoena, Michaël Ciani, Nicolás Pareja, Oguchi Onyewu, Rabiu Afolabi, Cheick Tioté, Peter Odemwingie, Joseph Yobo, Ouwo Moussa Maazou, Milan Jovanović, Ognjen Vukojević, Ivan Perišić, Nikica Jelavić, Demba Ba, Dante, Bryan Ruiz and Rob Rensenbrink.\n\nBecause of the physical nature of Belgian football, it has tended to primarily produce talented defensive players. These include Jean-Marie Pfaff, Eric Gerets, Leo Clijsters, Michel Preud'homme, Georges Grün, Philippe Albert, Franky Van Der Elst, Vincent Kompany and Thomas Vermaelen. In comparison, only few attacking Belgian footballers have received international recognition: Enzo Scifo, Jan Ceulemans, Marc Degryse, Luc Nilis and Émile Mpenza.\n\nHowever, this latter trend is slowly starting to change, with Belgium producing such offensive talents as Romelu Lukaku, Eden Hazard, Mousa Dembélé, Christian Benteke, Kevin Mirallas, Marouane Fellaini, Kevin De Bruyne and Dries Mertens, among others.\n\nWith football's rapid growth in popularity in the late 19th century, several football clubs came into existence in Belgium. In 1926, the Royal Belgian Football Association decided to introduce matricule numbers to tell the clubs apart and assigned a matricule to each existing club by order of registration. In this manner, Antwerp was awarded matricule number 1 as the first to register. As such, the oldest clubs in Belgium typically have the lowest matricule numbers, although there are clubs which registered only years after their origination and as a result have a much higher matricule than would be expected. Many clubs, especially those with very low numbers, consider their matricule number part of their heritage and past and prominently feature it in their logo or even name. In case a club dissolves, the matricule number of this club is removed permanently and lost forever as numbers are never reused.\n\nIn case of mergers, the new club must decide which matricule number to keep, it normally begins the championship at the level where the former club with the same matricule number should have begun the season. Typically, mergers result in the most famous club's matricule being kept alive. However, it has often occurred that a club with a glorious past or even (multiple) championship titles had to merge with another less successful club in order to survive, often due to financial difficulties. In this case, the matricule number of the club, and the honours linked to it, were lost with the merger. As an examples, in the late 1990s, seven-time champion K. Beerschot VAC was struggling with financial difficulties in the third division and merged with then first division neighbour club KFC Germinal Ekeren to survive. The new club was named KFC Germinal Beerschot Antwerpen and started in the first division with the matricule number of KFC Germinal Ekeren, but lost the honours of K Beerschot VAC. The new club did keep playing in the Beerschot stadium and wore the purple shirt for which Beerschot was famously known. Another famous example is that of five-time champion Daring Club de Bruxelles' merger with RR White into R White Daring Molenbeek in 1973.\n\nFrom the 2010s, matricules have been sold and traded, with clubs wanting to take over the position in a (higher) series of another club acquiring these matricules in order to quickly move up one or more divisions. Examples include BX Brussels, which acquired the matricule of Bleid-Gaume in 2013, with the intent to transform and move the club from Bleid to Brussels, over 200 kilometres away. The Royal Belgian Football Association therefore enforced a new rule in 2016, stating that after a takeover, a club cannot move more than 30 kilometres from its original location.\n\nFrom 2017, the Belgian FA enforced another rule, which allows clubs to buy back their old defunct matricule, which was first done by Lyra (matricule 7776) who acquired the matricule 52 of the old defunct Lyra. In 2018, Oud-Heverlee Leuven, which is the result of a merger of three clubs around the city of Leuven, changed its matricule number 6142 back to number 18 to honour the glorious past of its eldest predecessor.\n\nThe first few matricule numbers are:\n\nA Belgian club's name usually includes the name of the town where the club plays as well as a prefix and/or suffix. Since Belgians speak three languages, French and Dutch being the main ones and German being the third official language, Belgian teams may use either language as the basis for their names. For historical reasons, many Flemish clubs changed their names from French to Dutch between the beginning of the 20th century and the late 1960s. Additionally, many clubs have experienced frequent name changes. Reasons for these include a language change, a merger, an anniversary, etc. Because of the numerous mergers between Belgian clubs, team names sometimes combine several town names (such as K. Beringen-Heusden-Zolder or Sporting West Ingelmunster-Harelbeke) which reflect mergers. In recent history, clubs representing immigrant communities have come into existence and sometimes use names that are in neither of Belgium's official languages (the now defunct clubs Türkgucun Ozburun and Türkiyemspor Zaventem, or the still-existing Agrupación Oviedo-Asturiana, existing only in a league outside the Belgian FA now, from Brussels, being examples).\n\nFinally, a team which exists for at least 50 years may add the prefix \"Royal\" to its name (either in English or in the team's language). Before 1958, this right was given to any team that celebrated its 25th year of existence. Between 1958 and 1968, the rule was changed to grant the title to any team with at least 35 years of existence. Since 1968, the time limit has increased to 50 years.\n\nThe following is a partial list of common football club name prefixes and suffixes in Belgium's two main languages.\nAnderlecht and KV Mechelen have won a European competition. Here is a list of the winners and runners-up by competition:\n\n\nUnder the first four levels in the league system, the competition is organized by province, with the notable exception of Brabant which comprises clubs from the provinces of Flemish Brabant, Walloon Brabant and the Brussels Capital Region.\n\nAs of the 2019–20 season, five clubs from West Flanders play in the First Division A (Club Brugge, Cercle Brugge, KV Kortrijk, KV Oostende and SV Zulte-Waregem), and one clubs plays in the First Division B (KSV Roeselare).\n\nTwo clubs from East Flanders currently play in the First Division A (AA Gent and Waasland-Beveren). KSC Lokeren were relegated from the First Division A after the 2018-19 season and as such, they will compete in the First Division B in 2019-20.\n\nThe province of Antwerp has an old tradition of football. The first Belgian clubs were established in the city of Antwerp (Antwerp Lyon's Club, A.S. Anvers-Borgerhout, and most notably Royal Antwerp, which is the country's oldest club and which is affectionately referred to as the \"Great Old\" by its supporters and the media).\n\nTwo clubs from this province currently play in the top flight: Royal Antwerp and KV Mechelen, while KVC Westerlo and Beerschot play in the First Division B.\n\nTwo clubs from Limburg currently play in the First Division A: KRC Genk and Sint-Truiden. Additionally, one club represents the province in First Division B: Lommel SK.\n\nTechnically-speaking, Brussels is not a province but rather an autonomous administrative (sub-)urban region within the province of Flemish Brabant. Only one currently active club from Brussels plays in First Division A, Anderlecht, also the country's most successful club to date.\n\nThe first-ever Belgian League Championship was made up out of seven teams, four of which were based in Brussels: Racing Club, Léopold Club Uccle, Sporting Club and Union d'Ixelles. Léopold Club was a club for the nobility and bourgeoisie in Brussels and is still active after no less than four mergers between 1982 and 2001 (they are currently playing in the Fourth Division). The latter two clubs ceased to exist in 1897 and 1901 respectively and were replaced by a new Brussels-based club (Royale Union Saint-Gilloise), which would become a dominant force in Belgian football during the following seasons, winning seven titles between 1903 and 1913. The club originally shared a rivalry with Racing Club and later Daring Club, which would go on and win the title in 1912. Later, Anderlecht became their biggest rival for citywide bragging rights.\n\nAfter World War I, Belgian football was dominated by clubs from Antwerp and Bruges. From the early 1930s, however, Union and Daring divided five titles between themselves. The rivalry between the two clubs has inspired a stage play named \"Bossemans et Coppenolle\" (\"Bossemans\" was the name of the Union head coach, \"Coppenolle\" his counterpart at Daring). Shortly after World War II, Anderlecht replaced Union and Daring as the dominant team in Brussels. Its cross-city rivals at the time were, in succession, Union, Daring and Racing White, later renamed R.W.D.M., still later named FC Brussels. The latter were liquidated in 2014 and revived a year later as RWDM47. White Star Bruxelles, a club from the Brussels suburban region, technically won promotion to the top flight after the 2015-16 season but due to the club's debts, both the Belgian FA and the courts did not award them a licence to practice professional football. As a result, the club were relegated to the First Amateur Division and were ultimately wound up in October 2017.\n\nRoyale Union Saint-Gilloise, currently in the First Division B, is the only Brussels club at that level in 2019–20.\n\nOnly one club from Flemish Brabant is currently active in the top two divisions of Belgian football, Oud-Heverlee Leuven, playing in the First Division B.\n\nAfter the 2018-19 season, AFC Tubize were relegation to the First Amateur Division and as a result, no club from Walloon Brabant plays in the top two divisions of Belgian football in 2019-20.\n\nTwo teams from Hainaut are currently playing in First Division A: Excel Mouscron and Charleroi SC.\n\nThe province of Namur is, along with that of Luxembourg, the province with the least prestigious football history in Belgium. Currently, no clubs from the province of Namur are playing in the top two levels of Belgian football. Furthermore, no club from this province has ever played in the top flight.\n\nRFC Liège won the first-ever Belgian title in 1896. The club struggled financially during the early years of the 21st century and was eventually dissolved in 2011. A new club was formed, which is currently competing in the First Amateur Division.\n\nCurrently, two clubs from the province of Liège are competing in First Division A, Standard Liège and KAS Eupen. The latter is the only club from the country's German-speaking region ever to have competed in the top flight. They first played at the top level in 2010–11 but were relegated after that season, before returning after the 2016–17 season. No team from the province is currently in the First Division B.\n\nHistorically, RFC Liège (five titles between 1895 and 1953) and Standard Liège (ten titles between 1958 and 2009) are the province's most successful, well-known and popular clubs.\n\nOnly one club from the province of Luxembourg will plays in the top two levels of Belgian football: Excelsior Virton, who won promotion to the First Division B after the 2018-19 season. No club from this province has ever played in the top flight. Former Belgian international Philippe Albert (Bouillon) and current international Thomas Meunier (Sainte-Ode) were born in the province.\n\nAs of the 2016–17 season, the Belgian football league pyramid has nine levels. The FA dramatically overhauled the league system after the 2015–16 season, reducing the number of professional teams to 24 and introducing a nationwide amateur league for the first time.\n\nNationwide leagues:\n\n\nRegional leagues:\n\nProvincial leagues:\n\nEach provincial subdivision of the FA runs its own 4-division league. Only teams that are geographically located in a certain province are allowed to compete in the corresponding provincial league. To include as well teams from the capital region of Brussels (which is not a province by itself and also does not belong to a province), teams from Brussels, Flemish Brabant and Walloon Brabant are split into two similar leagues based on their language. As a result there are two \"provincial\" leagues corresponding to the former Province of Brabant: one Brabant \"provincial\" league for Flemish clubs (including all Flemish clubs from Brussels, Flemish Brabant and Walloon Brabant) and a Brabant \"provincial\" league for Francophone clubs (including all Francophone clubs from Brussels, Flemish Brabant and Walloon Brabant). The majority of the clubs from the Brussels capital region are Francophone, de-facto resulting in two provincial leagues roughly corresponding to Flemish Brabant one on hand; and Walloon Brabant and Brussels on the other hand.\n\nThe following teams have qualified for the group stage in the UEFA Champions League:\n\n\nOther than the UEFA-affiliated Royal Belgian Football Association, several amateur football leagues exist in Belgium, most at regional levels. These are often called \"pub teams' leagues\", although this is not entirely correct: far from all clubs represent a pub, as often there are teams enrolled who represent a town or district of a village, a company or another institution. Many amateur leagues exist in Belgium, most of them are region-bound or province-bound. Examples of amateur leagues with a long tradition include the KVV (Koninklijke Vlaamse Voetbalbond) organising provincial leagues in all Flemish provinces save for West-Vlaanderen; the MTSA for the area Dendermonde-Aalst-Denderstreek; the LVVB Melle for the area Wetteren-Ghent (with some clubs outside this area); the LVV Meetjesland for the Meetjesland area and few clubs from Ghent, the Corporative Leagues in several provinces mainly intended for company teams (although sometimes also including general amateur teams), the WALIVO in the Waasland area, the ABSSA and Travailliste leagues in Brussels and surrounding areas, … The system is complex as some of these regional leagues are affiliated to the Belgian FA (sometimes their member clubs receive a matricule number) but the leagues are totally separate from the league system in the leagues directly run by the Belgian FA (described above). Some other amateur leagues operate totally separate from the Belgian FA with no connection to the Belgian FA in any ways. Amateur leagues are in decline in some areas due to the competition from the general Belgian FA-run leagues and due to long travel distances being unpractical at amateur level. Several clubs who started in amateur leagues have made the transfer to the leagues run directly by the Belgian FA (starting at the lowest level). Some of these clubs even managed to, after a while, reach a relatively high level of the Belgian pyramid. Many amateur leagues in the past were tied to a political ideology, and Catholic, Socialist and Liberal amateur leagues existed. Nowadays most amateur leagues are based upon geographic area rather than on political ideologies.\n\nIn Belgium, the Belgian FA also runs a nationwide Futsal league. Clubs are given a matricule number as well, although a separate one than the matricule numbers assigned to the clubs in outdoor football. Usually the letter A is in front of the matricule number to indicate an indoor club. A separate indoor football league is organised by the BZVB (Belgische Zaalvoetbal Bond, translated as Belgian Indoor Football Association), this is not tied to the Belgian FA. Both of these leagues run at the same moment but without any interaction with each other.\n\nIn addition, Mini Football is popular in Belgium (this has different rules all together than Futsal) and this league is run by a separate FA dealing with mini football only.\n\nBoth the Belgian FA and several regional amateur football leagues run a league for women. The league operated by the Belgian FA consists of three nationwide levels, with several levels per province below. The Belgian FA started to organise women's football in the early seventies, due to the UEFA obligating every member FA to organise leagues for women as well as for men. In the beginning the Belgian FA discouraged women to play football and advised them to opt for sports such as volleyball. The first season only existing clubs (with male teams) could enrol a female team in the league. As popularity of women's football grew and more and more teams wanted to play in the league, the Belgian FA dropped the above rule and accepted new clubs to affiliate who only focussed on ladies' football. These clubs are assigned matricule numbers just like any other club, and meanwhile women's football is fully integrated in the Belgian football structure. However, the league is not professional as yet (only a few female players have been full-time professionals) and the national team is amongst the weaker teams in Europe due to other countries such as Germany, Norway, Sweden having fully professional women's leagues. Clubs who have been successful in past or present in Belgian women's football include Brussels Dames '71 (currently the women's team of Anderlecht), Rapide Wezemaal, Astro Begijnendijk, Eva's Kumtich, Sinaai Girls, Standard Fémina Liège, Dames Eendracht Aalst (previously tied to the club KSC Eendracht Aalst which was also successful in men's football).\n\nIn the early 2010s, plans existed to develop a new super league where existing clubs with professional men's teams would enroll a women's team. Eventually, the Belgian and Dutch FAs launched a joint top-level league, the BeNe League, in 2012. Before the launch of this league, several famous clubs had created women's teams, such as Club Brugge, Lierse SK, Germinal Beerschot Antwerpen, and St-Truidense VV. After the 2014–15 season, the two countries chose to disband the BeNe League and relaunch their own national top flights; the Dutch revived their women's Eredivisie, while Belgium chose instead to create a totally new top flight, the Super League.\n\n\n"}

McCarthy went backstage and offered his services as a professional singer who was experienced with the piece. Given that the understudy for the part – a member of the choir – was, in fact, a doctor and therefore looking after Allen, his offer was accepted and McCarthy went onstage to complete the performance. He received a standing ovation.\n\nIn 1980, McCarthy re-located from London to Colchester.

{"id": "2156017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156017", "title": "Uno Cygnaeus", "text": "Uno Cygnaeus\n\nUno Cygnaeus (12 October 1810 in Hämeenlinna – 2 January 1888 in Helsinki) was a Finnish clergyman, educator, and chief inspector of the country's school system. He is considered the father of the Finnish public school system. His accomplishments also include the initiation of high class teacher training, emphasizing the importance of women's education and most importantly introducing the use of crafts (\"veisto\" in Finnish, sloyd/sløyd in Norwegian, slöjd in Swedish, and \"sløjd\" in Danish), as a mandatory subject in the school curriculum.\n\nCygnaeus was born in Hämeenlinna, Finland, on 12 October 1810. His father died early in his childhood when he was 8 years old. Uno studied natural sciences and theology at the University of Turku and continued in Helsinki when the university moved over to Helsinki. In 1837 he was ordained as a priest and started serving in Viipuri till 1839. In Viipuri he served as assistant pastor and prison chaplain in addition to teaching at a private school. This experience and his study of the work of the educational philosophers Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and Friedrich Fröbel led to the formulation of Cygnaeus's own educational philosophy and ideas.\n\nIn 1840 he was sent off to Russian America to serve for five years as the first pastor of Sitka Lutheran Church in New Archangel (now Sitka, Alaska) as a punishment for an extramarital affair. This place was a trading post, where Cygnaeus got a chance to observe the barter exchanges between the Europeans and the Native Alaskans. Upon his return, he spent twelve years as a superintendent of a Finnish parish school in St. Petersburg.\n\nIn 1855 the Russian senate was commissioned to advance the educational system in Finland after Tsar Alexander II ascended to the throne. The senate collected proposals from different sources. Uno Cygnaeus also sent a proposal which gained the senate's support and Cygnaeus was appointed to develop a folk school system. He travelled via Sweden and Denmark to the German States and to Switzerland to collect information about different educational systems. He was most influenced by the kindergartens in Hamburg and the Swiss school system. Cygnaeus drew up a plan on the basis of notes, which he took during his journeys and the senate approved his plan in 1861.\n\nCygnaeus advocated separating schools from the supervision of the church and establishing a teacher training college. Cygnaeus's plan formed the basis for the folk school regulation, which was laid down in 1866. The Sloyd system became compulsory for boys in all rural schools (it still is all over the country-2007) and for all male teachers in teacher training institutions. Students learned about metals, about fabrication techniques, about selecting appropriate wood samples from the forests, about the care necessary for working with materials and finally the need for collaborative efforts to accomplish tasks. Sweden adopted these ideas a few years after Finland. A 'Sloyd Training School' was set up in Nääs, Sweden in the 1870s by Otto Salomon. Thousands of teachers from all over the world attended classes at Nääs. Some of the countries in which Sloyd was successfully introduced were the UK, the US, Japan, Brazil, Argentina, Cuba, and the Scandinavian countries. Currently, Sloyd is still part of the compulsory school curriculum in Finland, Sweden and Norway.\n\nThe influence of Cygnaeus also reached the United States (Bennet 1937) when Larsson, trained by Otto Salomon, moved to the U.S. and founded the ‘Boston Sloyd School’ in 1888. This institution is still regarded as an important step in American technological education (Phillips 1985). The views of the American educator John Dewey were based on then current global trends, one of the most important one being the Sloyd movement begun by Cygnaeus. D.W. Olson, the first American researcher writing about technology education, values Cygnaeus quite highly.\n\nFinnish general education still has educative handicraft [“käsityö“] as a school subject. It is divided into two separate subjects: textile work [“tekstiilityö“] and technical work [“tekninen työ“]. They are taught as compulsory subjects from the third grade of primary education. Students can choose either “tekninen työ“ or “tekstiilityö“.\n\nFrom 1863 until 1869, Cygnaeus served, besides being a chief inspector of the country's school system, as the director of a Finnish seminary at Jyväskylä. After that he returned to full-time job as chief inspector and 1870–87 he was also a member of the supreme board of education.\n\nCygnaeus died on 2 January 1888 in Helsinki, Finland.\n\nHis cousin, Fredrik Cygnaeus, was a Swedish-language poet.\n\n"}

He created the \"Sorcerer\" role-playing game, the GNS theory of gameplay, and The Big Model. Edwards is also co-founder of The Forge, an online community to support indie RPG design and publication.\n\nRon Edwards first started playing RPGs in 1978 when he was 14, starting with \"Dungeons & Dragons\", which had been published four years earlier. He also tried other RPGs such as \"Tunnels & Trolls\", \"Runequest\", and his early favorite, \"The Fantasy Trip\". Through high school and university, he continued to play RPGs, and entered an experimental phase in the 1980s and 1990s, playing as many as 200 different RPGs, including \"Champions\", \"Stormbringer\", \"GURPS\", \"Rolemaster\", \"Cyberpunk 2020\", \"Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game\" and \"Over the Edge\".\n\nWhile Edwards was a graduate student and biology instructor at the University of Florida, working on his PhD and writing a dissertation focused on evolutionary theory, he began to design an RPG he called \"Sorcerer\". He sent the finished game to an existing RPG publisher; the publisher agreed to publish it and sent Edwards a standard contract, which gave the publisher the right to control artwork and marketing, to revise the book in the future if the author did not want to and to terminate the contract at their discretion. Edwards found the proposed contract unacceptable — inspired by indie comic creator Dave Sim, he believed that creators should have control over their own works. \n\nAs a result, he turned down the offer to publish, and in 1996, he printed copies of \"Sorcerer\" and distributed them using the shareware model, mailing a copy to anyone who asked for it and asking for $5 in return if they liked the game. Soon afterward he produced an ashcan of the game to sell at conventions. He continued to playtest \"Sorcerer\" and produced a fully rewritten version of the game that he began selling in PDF form after acquiring the sorcerer-rpg.com domain. \n\nHe also produced two PDF supplements – \"Sorcerer & Sword\" (1999) and \"The Sorcerer's Soul\" (2000) – and also licensed Concept Syndicate to sell \"Sorcerer\" on a CD-ROM.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Edwards was involved in discussions on Usenet about the theory of gameplay during RPGs, debating topics such as the fiction generated during role-playing — in Edwards' words, \"when it is or isn't a story, and if it is, how it got that way.\" As Edwards monitored the Usenet discussions, he realized that different players brought dramatically different priorities to the table — what he called Gamism, Narrativism, and Simulationism. In an online article in 1999, Edwards started to posit what would become his \"GNS Theory\" of how those three elements were related to techniques used during role-playing. \n\nHe also began to discuss the \"Big Model\" of role-playing, saying, \"We needed to be discussing roleplaying as a social event, which was even bigger than individual, or better, expected shared-group priorities. The name 'Big Model' refers to this 'bigness,' starting with everything that plays into who we are and why we sit down to play together.\" In the \"Big Model\", Edwards explores the layers of the role-playing game: the social event as the outer layer, the imaginary material lying beneath that, and the rules system as the inner core.\n\nWith Ed Healy, Edwards created the website Hephaestus's Forge in December 1999, as a creator-owned-game publisher site. The original site closed in late 2000 due to hosting problems, but Edwards and Clinton R. Nixon resurrected the site as \"The Forge\" in April 2001, hosted at indie-rpgs.com. It continued to run successfully until 2012. \n\nAfter seeing \"Obsidian: The Age of Justice\", an RPG independently published by Micah Skaritka, Dav Harnish, and Frank Nolan, for sale at Gencon 33 in 2000, Edwards decided he could publish his own RPG books while retaining ownership. He created Adept Press, through which he published his second RPG, \"Elfs\" (2001) as a PDF. He also re-published \"Sorcerer\" as a 128-page hardcover volume in 2001. RPG historians Steven Torres-Roman and Cason Snow believe this was a turning point for indie RPGs, saying that when Edwards released the hardcover version, he \"showed independent game designers the way to publish their own games.\" Ron Edwards and \"Sorcerer\" subsequently won the second annual Diana Jones Award for \"excellence in gaming\" in 2002. \n\nEdwards purchased a booth at GenCon 34 in 2001 for Adept Press; the following year, the booth was doubled in size to also include The Forge. \n\nIn a departure from his \"Sorcerer\" material, Edwards released the unusual RPG \"Trollbabe\" in 2002, where all players take on the role of Trollbabes, large female trolls. \n\nIn 2004, he returned to \"Sorcerer\" with the third supplement, \"Sex and Sorcery\". In 2006, he created an RPG called \"It Was a Mutual Decision\" during a 24-hour challenge that he himself had set for other RPG designers. In 2007, he createded \"\", an RPG set in World War II Berlin. In 2009, he published the unusual two-player RPG \"S/lay w/Me\", where one player is the hero while the other takes on the role of both the hero's lover and his monstrous opponent. In 2015, Edwards created \"Circle of Hands\", a gritty low-magic RPG set in the Iron Age.\n\nIn 2002, Ron Edwards and his role-playing game \"Sorcerer\" were awarded the Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming. The award citation reads in part \"First self-published online for as a for-sale PDF, \"Sorcerer\" — together with its creator and publisher Ron Edwards — represent the potential of the independent innovator in today’s RPG industry [...] His successful nurturing of an online forum dedicated to creator-controlled games have leveraged a mere brilliant game design into the seed crystal of something with the potential to greatly improve adventure gaming.\"\n\nAlso in 2002, Edwards was awarded a Indie RPG Award in the category \"Human of the Year\". His award citation reads in part \"He has single-handedly done more for the indie RPG industry than anyone by helping folks get started or into the industry, promoting others' games, and generally being an amazing rescource to us all [...] He is a bloody powerhouse of rock and roll game-designerdom.

It is played at all Minnesota Golden Gophers games.\n\nThe phrase 'Ski-U-Mah' was part of an early cheer for the U of M.\n\nGopher fans traditionally thrust their fists in the air during the spell-out, and make a circular motion with their fist during the yell.\n\nThe original lyrics were published in the Minneapolis Tribune, November 21, 1909.\n\nIt was the subject of a 1909 contest held by the \"Minnesota Daily\" and the \"Minneapolis Tribune\" to write a suitable song for Minnesota football games, to replace the hymnlike \"Hail! Minnesota\". The song was written by Floyd Hutsell, then the choir director of First Methodist Episcopal Church in Minneapolis. He originally included a verse, but only the refrain is sung today. Hutsell is best known outside Minnesota as \"Robert LaMar,\" a prominent vaudeville and operetta actor and producer. The song was originally titled, \"The U. of M. Rouser,\" but eventually became known as simply the \"Minnesota Rouser.\"\n\nSheet music to the winning song was published November 21, 1909, as a Supplement to the \"Minneapolis Sunday Tribune\". Written in the key of G major, it was titled \"The U. of M. Rouser\" and was dedicated to B. A. Rose, Band Master, U. of M. The verse was included in this publication. The Judges for the fighting song, listed on the back, were: A.O. Eberhart, Governor of Minnesota; Cyrus W. Northrop, President of the University of Minnesota; Carlyle M. Scott, Professor of Music, University of Minnesota; J.A. Sende, Chief Musician, University of Minnesota Band; and Arthur Allen, President of the University of Minnesota Glee and Mandolin Club.\n\nThe contest spawned another prominent Big Ten song. William T. Purdy also submitted a song for the contest, titled \"Minnesota, Minnesota.\" He withdrew it from the contest at the urging of his lyricist, Carl Beck, who wanted to offer the song to the University of Wisconsin, where it became \"On Wisconsin\".\n\nThe Boston-based rock orchestra, The Wings of Fire Orchestra, uses a variation of the U. of Minnesota Rouser on the song Connorfool (from \"Bullfighter Ballet\", 2006).\n\nOn \"Rocky and Bullwinkle\", the lyrics are changed to \"Wossamotta, Hats Off to U\" (\"Hail, Wossamotta, hail/Better we should land in jail.\")\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2156030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156030", "title": "Baker Plan", "text": "Baker Plan\n\nThe Baker Plan (formally, Peace Plan for Self-Determination of the People of Western Sahara) is a United Nations initiative to grant self-determination to Western Sahara. It was intended to replace the Settlement Plan of 1991, which was further detailed in the Houston Agreement of 1997.\n\nWestern Sahara's administration by Morocco since 1975 is challenged by Polisario guerillas living in exile in neighbouring Algeria. Since 1991, a ceasefire has been in place, accepted by both parties with the understanding that the UN would organize a referendum on independence. The 1991 referendum plan was stalled, however, due to disagreements on voter eligibility. Morocco demanded the inclusion of all people now living in the territory, including all Moroccan settlers. Following the 1975 Green March, the Moroccan state has sponsored enticing thousands of Moroccans to move into the Moroccan-occupied part of Western Sahara (80% of the territory). By 2015, it was estimated that Moroccan settlers made up at least two-thirds of the 500,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe Polisario Front insisted on inclusion of only found in the 1974 final Spanish census and their descendants; the 1974 census had been mentioned as the basis of voter lists in the 1991 agreement. Specialized Minurso identification teams eventually found in favor of some 80,000 voters deemed to be indigenous to the territory. That number corresponded quite closely to the Spanish census of 75,000 persons, which caused Morocco to launch appeals against the voter list on behalf of over 100,000 rejected applicants from the Moroccan side. This stalled the process, and by the late 1990s, Morocco had begun declaring the referendum a \"dead option.\"\n\nThe first draft of the plan, called Baker I or the Framework Agreement, was circulated by the UN special envoy James Baker in 2000, but never presented formally to the Security Council. Although based on Baker's proposals, it was drafted by a Morocco-sponsored legal team. It offered the people of Western Sahara autonomy within the Moroccan state. Except for defense and foreign policy, all other decisions would be the responsibility of local government. Morocco accepted the plan, but Algeria and the Polisario front rejected it. Algeria countered by proposing that the territory be divided between the parties.\nThe second version (informally known as Baker II) envisioned Saharan self-rule under a Western Sahara Authority for a period of five years, with a referendum on independence to follow. In this referendum, the entire present-day population of Western Sahara would participate, including people who had migrated from or been settled by Morocco post-1975, something which Polisario had so far refused. On the other hand, a provision that the interim local government (the Western Sahara Authority) would be elected only by a restricted voters' list (those identified as original inhabitants of the territory by Minurso) alienated Morocco. After Morocco had voiced early objections to Baker II, Algeria and the Polisario front reluctantly accepted the plan as a basis for negotiations. In July 2003, the UN Security Council endorsed the plan, something that it had not done with Baker's first draft, and unanimously called for the parties to implement it. Morocco, however, then rejected the plan, saying that it would no longer agree to any referendum that included independence as an option.\n\nAfter this, Baker resigned in protest, the second UN envoy to Western Sahara to do so. He indicated that given the irreconcilable positions of the parties and the Security Council's refusal to enforcing a solution over the objections of either party, there no longer appeared to be a feasible way to implement the 1991 Settlement Plan or to reach another compromise solution. While the Polisario, anxious to have a strong mediator with US backing in charge of the UN process, deplored his resignation, Moroccan officials viewed it in a positive light; foreign minister Benaissa publicly called the resignation a result of \"the tenacity of Moroccan diplomacy\".\n\nSince early 2005, the UN Secretary General has not referred to the plan in his reports, and by now it seems largely dead. No replacement plan exists, however worries persist that the political vacuum will result in renewed fighting. Morocco has proposed autonomy for the territory as a final solution to the conflict.\n\n"}

For the celebrations to mark Her Majesty's Diamond Jubilee in 2012, instead of a Fleet Review such as marked that of Queen Victoria, there was a cavalcade of boats down the Thames.\n\nDuring the afternoon of 28 June 2005, Queen Elizabeth II, as Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom, embarked on board HMS \"Endurance\". Led by THV \"Patricia\", and with following as \"Sovereign's Escort\", Her Majesty set sail to review a fleet of over 167 ships of the Royal Navy and of over 30 other nations, as well as other non-naval vessels such as the passenger liner \"QE2\". The previous fleet review by the Queen in the United Kingdom was in 1999 for the commemoration of the anniversary of the Battle of the Atlantic.\n\nThe review took place at Spithead, on the Solent, between Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight, in England. The Fleet Review is a 600-year-old British tradition, and until the 2005 review consisted of mainly Royal Navy ships, with a small number of invited foreign ships, but there are today no longer enough Royal Navy warships available in home waters for this to be worthwhile.

{"id": "2156067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156067", "title": "Disaster tourism", "text": "Disaster tourism\n\nDisaster tourism has been defined as the practice of visiting locations at which an environmental disaster, either natural or man-made, has occurred. Although a variety of disasters are the subject of subsequent disaster tourism, the most common disaster tourist sites are the areas surrounding volcanic eruptions. Opinions on the morality and impact of disaster tourism are divided. Advocates of disaster tourism often claim that the practice raises awareness of the event, stimulates the local economy, and educates the public about the local culture, while critics claim that the practice is exploitative, profits on loss, and often mischaracterizes the events in question.\n\nAn Article by smartertravel defines the conventional motivations present in individuals practicing disaster tourism. Attraction is typically derived from personal connection in a social, academic or cultural essence. Another population of visitors hope to aid in providing relief to the affected areas—some directly through volunteer work and some indirectly through donations. Other visitors have no connection to the site or the event, but happen to be there as tourists and visit those places as part of their sightseeing. A common example of this is tourists who come to Italy to sightsee in Rome and end up visiting Pompeii and its neighboring cities without initially intending to do so.\n\nDisaster tourism has had a mixed reception, with critics labelling it as voyeuristic and profiting off of loss and with advocates arguing that the tourism stimulates the recovering economy and brings awareness to local culture. Although the public perception of tourism depends on a wide variety of factors, such whether the disaster was man-made or natural and how long it has been since the incident, there are some general trends in the reception of tourism.\n\nDepending on the site or tour, disaster tourism can be seen to be an educational experience or exploitative. Whether or not a tourist site is handled in a respectful and tactful manner often is determined both by those organizing the events and the tourists themselves. Moreover, advocates of disaster tourism point out that attractions are capable of re-examining disasters in an educational manner despite that the operators are motivated by profit. Many of these advocates argue that when distasteful disaster tourism occurs, the blame lies primarily on the tourists for providing an insensitive demand rather on the operators for fulfilling such a demand. For both tourists and operators, however, parsing the difference between an educational and an exploitative one requires asking what areas are crucial for understanding the disaster and clarifying how behavior that is appropriate in a destroyed area is often different from behavior that is appropriate in newly built homes or temporary camps.\n\nThe effect of tourism on the local economy is often nuanced due to the specifics in how tourism affects local income. It is generally accepted that if the tours comprise public events organized by volunteers, then there are consistent but small increases to charity donations. However, if the tours are organized by private companies, then it is not always clear how what proportion of the profits go back into relief efforts. Furthermore, while governmental regulation typically prevents private tours from slowing down or reversing reconstruction in areas where reconstruction has already began, critics argue that private touring may deincentivize the reconstruction of locations and sites, in which reconstruction has yet to occur. Another possible situation is that the tours are not organized by formal entities but instead by less cohesive groups of citizens. These cases are relatively unstudied due to their rarity.\n\nSimilarly, visiting disaster sites is thought to have an effect on empathy, but the nature of the effect it has depends on the particulars of the visit. Unorganized visits, for example, can often raise empathy by forcing the visitors to see suffering up close and prompting them to consider how to interact with victims. More organized visits, on the other hand, have been accused of lowering empathy because they comprised tourists “acting like tourists and dressing like tourists,” which dilutes and sanitizes the experience.\n\nIn September 2017, Hurricane Maria devastated the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Hurricane Maria is estimated to caused 4,645 deaths total, and in Puerto Rico, it is estimated to have caused $94 billion in property damage and displaced approximately 60,000 people.\n\nOn October 9, 2017, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook social VR chief Rachel Franklin used a livestream to showcase Facebook’s new VR app, Facebook Spaces, by taking a virtual tour of the devastated areas Puerto Rico. During the 10 minute video, Zuckerberg explains how Facebook partnered with Red Cross to build population map from satellite imagery and better allocate the relief effort.\n\nThe public reception to the tour was unanimously negative. Zuckerberg drew criticism for describing VR as \"magical\" in its ability to transport people to disaster zones, and most viewers considered the cartoon avatars of Zuckerberg and Franklin to be an inappropriately jovial tone. The day following the livestream, Zuckerberg apologized, explaining, \"When you're in VR yourself, the surroundings feel quite real. But that sense of empathy doesn't extend well to people watching you as a virtual character on a 2D screen.\"\n\nWhen the nearby volcano Mt Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, the eruption buried the city of Pompeii and the nearby city of Herculaneum and preserved everything from its streets to its frescoes under mounds of pumice and ash. Although Pompeii was initially rediscovered in 1599, tourism was undesirable until Spanish engineer Rocque Joaquin de Alcubierre performed a much larger excavation in 1748, which revealed many noteworthy structures, such as a fully intact Roman theatre.\n\nToday, Pompeii belongs to the much larger Vesuvius National Park and is one of Italy’s most popular tourist sites, attracting approximately 2.5 million visitors annually.\n\nIn the early evening of May 6, 1937, the German passenger airship LZ 129 Hindenburg burst into flame during a docking attempt at the Lakehurst Naval Air Station, just outside Lakehurst, New Jersey. With the cause of the fire unknown and a death toll of thirty-seven passengers, the Hindenburg disaster became one of the biggest news stories of its time.\n\nToday, a bronze plaque and cement outline the site of the incident. Immediately east of the crash site, volunteers of the Navy Lakehurst Historical Society will conduct public tours of Historic Hangar One, the location where the Hindenburg was kept.\n\nOn the morning of April 26, 1986, the number four reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded, producing airborne radioactive materials and a fire that burned for ten days. The Chernobyl explosion caused dozens of direct deaths and thousands of deaths due to long-term exposure. In the aftermath, 350,000 residents were displaced from Chernobyl and the nearby city of Pripyat. The other three reactors at Chernobyl power plant continued running at the time but were gradually lessened until the power plant’s shutdown in 2000.\n\nThe Ukraine-based tour company SoloEast Travel currently runs daylong tours through Chernobyl’s exclusion zone, a thousand square-mile area that includes the plant. The highlights of the tour include visiting Red Forest, a pine tree woodland destroyed by radioactive contamination, exploring Kopachi, a nearby village that was demolished due to high contamination levels, and finally coming within 1000 feet of the remains of the number four reactor. These tours are met with some controversy because despite that SoloEast Travel claims that publicly accessible areas surrounding the power plant contain low levels of radiation and are deemed safe, a number of third party scientists disagree.\n\nIn 1989, the \"Exxon Valdez\" oil tanker struck Alaska's Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound and leaked crude oil into the sound. An estimated 30 million plus gallons spilled. Oil from the spill would eventually contaminate more than 11,000 square-miles of ocean and 1300 miles of coastline. The spill killed hundreds of sea otters, harbor seals, and eagles and hundreds of thousands of seabird in the days following the spill. Despite that it is not the world's largest oil spill, the \"Exxon Valdez\" oil spill is typically considered the most notorious in American history.\n\nHaving been among the first responders, the family-run Stan Stephens Cruises operates glacier tours out of Prince William Sound that highlight the history surrounding the Exxon Valdez spill and its aftermath.\n\nIn late August 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated the American city of New Orleans. Although 80–90% of the population was evacuated prior, twenty-three breaches in navigational canal levees, drainage canal levees, and floodwalls occurred as a result of Katrina’s storm surge. With these failures, 80% of New Orleans became flooded, which in turn caused over 200,000 homes to be destroyed and 800,000 residents to be displaced. At the time, the disaster had a large impact on the politics, population, and economics for a sizable portion of the United States.\n\nA decade after the incident, the effects of Hurricane Katrina are still visible and catastrophic. Although many companies offer bus tours of the still-damaged regions, critics argues that these tours interfere with the relief effort. Some have suggested that curious tourists should instead go on bike tours in order to restrict the disruption to residents trying to get their lives back on track. Quite frequently, tours will focus on showcasing the culture of specific districts and neighborhood, treating Hurricane Katrina as the most recent event in a much longer cultural history. Many tours donate their profits or a portion of their profits to local relief organizations.\n\nEyjafjallajökull, in Iceland, began erupting on 20 March 2010. At this time, about 500 farmers and their families from the areas of Fljótshlíð, Eyjafjöll, and Landeyjar were evacuated overnight, but allowed to return to their farms and homes after Civil Protection Department risk assessment. On 14 April 2010, Eyjafjallajökull erupted for the second time, requiring 800 people to be evacuated.\n\nIn the wake of the first eruption, tour companies offered trips to see the volcano. However, the ash cloud from the second eruption disrupted air traffic over Great Britain and most of northern and western Europe, making it difficult to travel to Iceland even though Iceland's airspace itself remained open throughout.\n\nIn the November of 2010, the active Indonesian volcano of Mt Merapi had its second eruption in a century, which led to direct deaths of 353 people and the displacement of approximately 400,000 people in nearby villages.\n\nMt Merapi is unique among disaster tourist sites because Merapi was a popular tourist site prior to the volcano’s eruption, and tourism had already made up a significant portion of the local economy. While many tour companies and travel agencies hold more standard sightseeing tours of the affected areas, some programs provide more direct paths to donating to local charities and getting involved in the relief effort. For example, the Go Green Campaign encourages tourists to purchase small trees or seeds and plant them in local villages.\n\n"}

At the time that the program launched, the typical retail price for a laptop was considerably in excess of $1,000 (US), so it was not practically possible to achieve this objective without also bringing a low-cost machine to production. This became the OLPC XO Laptop, a low-cost and low-power laptop computer. The project was originally funded by member organizations such as AMD, eBay, Google, Marvell Technology Group, News Corporation, Nortel. Chi Mei Corporation, Red Hat, and Quanta provided in-kind support.\n\nThe OLPC project has been the subject of extensive praise and criticism. It was praised for pioneering low-cost, low-power laptops and inspiring later variants such as Eee PCs and Chromebooks; for assuring consensus at ministerial level in many countries that computer literacy is a mainstream part of education; for creating interfaces that worked without literacy in any language, and particularly without literacy in English. It has been criticized from many sides regarding its US-centric focus that ignores bigger problems, high total costs that may be quite cost-ineffective, low focus on maintainability and training and its limited success so far.\n\nThe OLPC program has its roots in the pedagogy of Seymour Papert, an approach known as constructionism, which espoused providing computers for children at early ages to enable full digital literacy. Papert, along with Nicholas Negroponte, were at the MIT Media Lab from its inception. Papert compared the old practice of putting computers in a computer lab to books chained to the walls in old libraries. Negroponte likened shared computers to shared pencils. However, this pattern seemed to be inevitable, given the then-high prices of computers (over $1,500 apiece for a typical laptop or small desktop by 2004).\n\nIn 2005, Negroponte spoke at the World Economic Forum, in Davos. In this talk he urged industry to solve the problem, to enable a $100 laptop, which would enable constructionist learning, would revolutionize education, and would bring the world's knowledge to all children. He brought a mock-up and was described as prowling the halls and corridors of Davos to whip up support. Despite the reported skepticism of Bill Gates and others, Negroponte left Davos with committed interest from AMD, News Corp, and with strong indications of support from many other firms.\nFrom the outset, it was clear that Negroponte thought that the key to reducing the cost of the laptop was to reduce the cost of the display. Thus, when, upon return from Davos, he met Mary Lou Jepsen, the display pioneer who was in early 2005 joining the MIT Media Lab faculty, the discussions turned quickly to display innovation to enable a low-cost laptop. Convinced that the project was now possible, Negroponte led the creation of the first corporation for this: the Hundred Dollar Laptop Corp.\n\nAt the 2006 Wikimania, Jimmy Wales announced that the One Laptop Per Child Project would be including Wikipedia as the first element in their content repository. Wales explained, \"I think it is in my rational self interest to care about what happens to kids in Africa,\" elaborating in his fundraising appeal:\nAt the 2006 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) announced it would back the laptop. UNDP released a statement saying they would work with OLPC to deliver \"technology and resources to targeted schools in the least developed countries\".\n\nIn the first years of the project, the Association managed development and logistics, and the Foundation managed fundraising such as the Give One Get One campaign (\"G1G1\").\n\nIntel was a member of the association for a brief period in 2007. Shortly after OLPC's founder, Nicholas Negroponte, accused Intel of trying to destroy the non-profit, Intel joined the board with a mutual non-disparagement agreement between them and OLPC. Intel resigned its membership on January 3, 2008, citing disagreements with requests from Negroponte for Intel to stop dumping their Classmate PCs.\n\nIn 2008, Negroponte showed some doubt about the exclusive use of open-source software for the project, and made suggestions supporting a move towards adding Windows XP, which Microsoft was in the process of porting over to the XO hardware. Microsoft's Windows XP, however, is not seen by some as a sustainable operating system. Microsoft announced that they would sell them Windows XP for $3 per XO. It would be offered as an option on XO-1 laptops and possibly be able to dual boot alongside Linux. In response, Walter Bender, who was the former President of Software and Content for the OLPC project, left OLPC and founded Sugar Labs to continue development of the open source Sugar software which had been developed within OLPC. No significant deployments elected to purchase Windows licenses.\nCharles Kane became the new President and Chief Operating Officer of the OLPC Association on May 2, 2008. In late 2008, the NYC Department of Education purchased some XO computers for use by New York schoolchildren.\n\nAdvertisements for OLPC began streaming on the video streaming website Hulu and others in 2008. One such ad has John Lennon advertising for OLPC, with an unknown voice actor redubbing over Lennon's voice.\n\nIn 2008 OLPC lost significant funding. Their annual budget was slashed from $12 million to $5 million which resulted in a restructuring on January 7, 2009. Development of the Sugar operating environment was moved entirely into the community, the Latin America support organization was spun out and staff reductions, including Jim Gettys, affected approximately 50% of the paid employees. The remaining 32 staff members also saw salary reductions. Despite the downsizing, OLPC continued development of the XO-1.5 laptops.\n\nIn 2010, OLPC moved its headquarters to Miami. The Miami office currently oversees sales and support for the XO-1.5 laptop and its successors, including the XO Laptop version 4.0 and the OLPC Laptop.\n\nFunding from Marvell, finalized in May 2010, revitalized the foundation and enabled the 1Q 2012 completion of the ARM-based XO-1.75 laptops and initial prototypes of the XO-3 tablets. OLPC is currently taking orders for mass production of the XO 4.0, and has shipped over 3 million XO Laptops to children around the world.\n\nAt the World Summit on the Information Society held by the United Nations in Tunisia from November 16–18, 2005, several African representatives, most notably Marthe Dansokho (a missionary of United Methodist Church), voiced suspicions towards the motives of the OLPC project and claimed that the project was using an overly \"U.S. mindset\", pointing out that the presented solutions were not applicable to specifically \"African problems\". Dansokho said the project demonstrated misplaced priorities, stating that African women would not have enough time to research new crops to grow. She added that clean water and schools were more important. Mohammed Diop specifically criticized the project as an attempt to exploit the governments of poor nations by making them pay for hundreds of millions of machines and the need of further investments into internet infrastructure. Others have similarly criticized laptop deployments in very low income countries, regarding them as cost-ineffective when compared to far simpler measures such as deworming and other expenses on basic child health.\n\nLee Felsenstein, a computer engineer who played a central role in the development of the personal computer, criticized the centralized, top-down design and distribution of the OLPC.\n\nThe project originally aimed for a price of 100 US dollars. In May 2006, Negroponte told the Red Hat's annual user summit: \"It is a floating price. We are a nonprofit organization. We have a target of $100 by 2008, but probably it will be $135, maybe $140.\" A BBC news article in April 2010 indicated the price still remained above $200.\n\nIn April 2011, the price remained above $209. In 2013, more than 10% of the world population lived on less than US$2 per day. The latter income segment would have to spend more than a quarter of its annual income to purchase a single laptop, while the global average of ICT spending is 3% of income. Empirical studies show that the borderline between ICT as a necessity good and ICT as a luxury good is roughly around the \"magical number\" of US$10 per person per month, or US$120 per year.\n\nJohn Wood, founder of Room to Read (an NPO which builds schools and libraries), emphasizes affordability and scalability over high-tech solutions. While in favor of the One Laptop per Child initiative for providing education to children in the developing world at a cheaper rate, he has pointed out that a $2,000 library can serve 400 children, costing just $5 a child to bring access to a wide range of books in the local languages (such as Khmer or Nepali) and English; also, a $10,000 school can serve 400–500 children ($20–$25 a child). According to Wood, these are more appropriate solutions for education in the dense forests of Vietnam or rural Cambodia.\n\nThe Scandinavian aid organization FAIR proposed setting up computer labs with recycled second-hand computers as a cheaper initial investment. Negroponte argued against this proposition, stating the expensive running cost of conventional laptops. Computer Aid International doubted the OLPC sales strategy would succeed, citing the \"untested\" nature of its technology. CAI refurbishes computers and printers and sells them to developing countries for £42 a piece (compare it to £50 a piece for the OLPC laptops).\n\nThe OLPC project has also been criticized for allegedly adopting a \"one-shot\" deployment approach with little or no technical support or teacher training, and for neglecting pilot programs and formal assessment of outcomes in favor of quick deployment. Some authors attribute this unconventional approach to the OLPC promoters' alleged focus on constructivist education and 'digital utopianism'. Mark Warschauer, a Professor of University of California at Irvine and Morgan Ames, at the time of writing, a PhD candidate at Stanford University, have pointed out that the laptop by itself does not completely fill the need of students in underprivileged countries. The \"children’s machines\", as they have been called, have been deployed to several countries, for example Uruguay, Peru, and in the US, Alabama, but after a relatively short time, their usage has declined considerably, sometimes because of hardware problems or breakage, in some cases, as high as 27% to 59% within the first two years, and sometimes due to a lack of knowledge on the part of the users on how to take full advantage of the machine. \n\nHowever, another factor has recently been acknowledged: a lack of a direct relation to the pedagogy needed in the local context to be truly effective. Uruguay reports that only 21.5% of teachers use the laptop in the classroom on a daily basis, and 25% report using it less than once a week. In Alabama, 80.3% of students say they never or seldom use the computer for class work, and Peru, teachers report that in the first few months, 68.9% use the laptop three times per week, but after two months, only 40% report such usage. Those of a low socio-economic level tend to not be able to effectively use the laptop for educational purposes on their own, but with scaffolding and mentoring from teachers, the machine can become more useful. According to one of the returning OLPC executives, Walter Bender, the approach needs to be more holistic, combining technology with a prolonged community effort, teacher training and local educational efforts and insights.\n\nThe organization has been accused of simply giving underprivileged children laptops and \"walking away\". Some critics claim this \"drive-by\" implementation model was the official strategy of the project. While the organisation has learning teams dedicated to support and working with teachers, Negroponte has said in response to this criticism that \"You actually can\" give children a connected laptop and walk away, noting experiences with self-guided learning.\n\nThe XO, previously known as the \"$100 Laptop\" or \"Children's Machine\", is an inexpensive laptop computer designed to be distributed to children in developing countries around the world, to provide them with access to knowledge, and opportunities to \"explore, experiment and express themselves\" (constructionist learning). The laptop is manufactured by the Taiwanese computer company Quanta Computer.\n\nThe rugged, low-power computers use flash memory instead of a hard drive, run a Fedora-based operating system and use the SugarLabs Sugar user interface. Mobile ad hoc networking based on the 802.11s wireless mesh network protocol allows students to collaborate on activities and to share Internet access from one connection. The wireless networking has much greater range than typical consumer laptops. The XO-1 has also been designed to be lower cost and much longer-lived than typical laptops.\n\nIn 2009, OLPC announced an updated XO (dubbed \"XO-1.5\") that takes advantage of the latest component technologies. The XO-1.5 includes a new VIA C7-M processor and a new chipset providing a 3D graphics engine and an HD video decoder. It has 1GB of RAM and built-in storage of 4 GB, with an option for 8 GB. The XO-1.5 uses the same display, and a network wireless interface with half the power dissipation.\n\nEarly prototype versions of the hardware were available in June 2009, and they are available for software development and testing available for free through a .\n\nAn XO-1.75 model was developed that used a Marvell ARM processor, targeting a price below $150 and date in 2011.\n\nThe XO-2 two sheet design concept was canceled in favor of the one sheet XO-3.\n\nAn XO-3 concept resembled a tablet computer and was planned to have the inner workings of the XO 1.75. Price goal was below $100 and date was 2012.\n\nAs of May 2010, OLPC was working with Marvell on other unspecified future tablet designs. In October 2010, both OLPC and Marvell signed an agreement granting OLPC $5.6 million to fund development of its XO-3 next generation tablet computer. The tablet was to use an ARM chip from Marvell.\n\nAt CES 2012, OLPC showcased the XO-3 model, which featured a touchscreen and a modified form of SugarLabs \"Sugar\". In early December 2012, however, it was announced that the XO-3 would not be seeing actual production, and focus had shifted to the XO-4.\n\nThe XO-4 was launched at International CES 2013 in Las Vegas The XO Laptop version 4 is available in two models: XO 4 and XO 4 Touch, with the latter providing multi-touch input on the display. The XO Laptop version 4 uses an ARM processor to provide high performance with low power consumption, while keeping the industrial design of the traditional XO Laptop.\n\nThe laptops include an anti-theft system which can, optionally, require each laptop to periodically make contact with a server to renew its cryptographic lease token. If the cryptographic lease expires before the server is contacted, the laptop will be locked until a new token is provided. The contact may be to a country-specific server over a network or to a local, school-level server that has been manually loaded with cryptographic \"lease\" tokens that enable a laptop to run for days or even months between contacts. Cryptographic lease tokens can be supplied on a USB flash drive for non-networked schools. The mass production laptops are also tivoized, disallowing installation of additional software or replacement of the operating system. Users interested in development need to obtain the unlocking key separately (most developer laptops for Western users already come unlocked). It is claimed that locking prevents unintentional bricking and is part of the anti-theft system.\n\nIn 2006, the OLPC project was heavily criticised over Red Hat's non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with Marvell concerning the wireless device in OLPC, especially in light of the OLPC project being positioned as an open-source friendly initiative. An open letter for documentation was inked by Theo de Raadt (a recipient of the 2004 Award for the Advancement of Free Software), and the initiative for open documentation has been supported by Richard Stallman, the President of the Free Software Foundation. De Raadt later clarified that he finds an issue with OLPC having proprietary firmware files that are not allowed to be independently re-distributed (even in the binary form) by third-party operating systems like OpenBSD, as well as receiving no documentation to write the necessary drivers for the operating system. De Raadt has pointed out that the OpenBSD project requires no firmware source code, and no low-level documentation to work on firmware, only requiring the binary distribution rights and documentation to interface with the said binary firmware that runs outside of the main CPU, a quite simple request that is generally honoured by many other wireless device vendors like Ralink. Stallman fully agreed with de Raadt's request to open up the documentation, since Stallman is known to hold an even stronger and more idealistic position in regards to the proprietary components, and requires that even the firmware that runs outside of the main CPU must be provided in its source code form, something de Raadt does not require. De Raadt later has had to point out that such more idealistic and less realistic position has instead been misattributed to OpenBSD's more practical approach to make it look unreasonable, and stood on record that OpenBSD's position is much easier to satisfy, yet it nonetheless remained unresolved.\n\nOLPC's dedication to \"Free and open source\" was questioned with their May 15, 2008, announcement that large-scale purchasers would be offered the choice to add an extra cost, special version of the proprietary Windows XP OS developed by Microsoft alongside the regular, free and open Linux-based operating system with the SugarLabs \"Sugar OS\" GUI. Microsoft developed a modified version of Windows XP and announced in May 2008 that Windows XP would be available for an additional cost of 10 dollars per laptop. James Utzschneider, from Microsoft, said that initially only one operating system could be chosen. OLPC, however, said that future OLPC work would enable XO-1 laptops to dual boot either the free and open Linux/Sugar OS or the proprietary Microsoft Windows XP. Negroponte further said that \"OLPC will sell Linux-only and dual-boot, and will not sell Windows-only <nowiki>[XO-1 laptops]</nowiki>\". OLPC released the first test firmware enabling XO-1 dual-boot on July 3, 2008. This option did not prove popular. As of 2011, a few pilots had received a few thousand total dual-boot machines, and the new ARM-based machines do not support Windows XP. No significant deployment purchased Windows licenses. Negroponte stated that the dispute had \"become a distraction\" for the project, and that its end goal was enabling children to learn, while constructionism and the open source ethos was more of a means to that end. Charles Kane concurred, stating that anything which detracted from the ultimate goal of widespread distribution and use was counterproductive.\n\nThe organization has been criticized for its lack of troubleshooting support. Teachers in Peru are told to handle problems in one of two ways. If the problem is a software issue, they are to flash the computer, and if it is a hardware problem, they are to report it. In the classroom environment this black-boxing approach is being criticized for causing the teachers and students to feel disconnected with, and confused by the laptop, which results, in many cases, in the laptops eventually going unused. Several defects in OLPC XO-1 hardware have emerged in the field, and laptop repair is often neglected by students or their families (who are responsible for maintenance) due to the relatively high cost of some components (such as displays).\n\nOn the software side, the Bitfrost security system has been known to deactivate improperly, rendering the laptop unusable until it is unlocked by support technicians with the proper keys. (This is a time-consuming process, and the problem often affects large numbers of laptops at the same time). The Sugar interface has been difficult for teachers to learn, and the mesh networking feature in the OLPC XO-1 was buggy and went mostly unused in the field.\n\nThe OLPC XO-1 hardware lacks connectivity to external monitors or projectors, and teachers are not provided with software for remote assessment. As a result, students are unable to present their work to the whole class, and teachers must also assess students' work from the individual laptops. Teachers often find it difficult to use the keyboard and screen, which were designed with student use in mind.\n\nIn 2005 and prior to the final design of the XO-1 hardware, OLPC received criticism because of concerns over the environmental and health impacts of hazardous materials found in most computers. The OLPC asserted that it aimed to use as many environmentally friendly materials as it could; that the laptop and all OLPC-supplied accessories would be fully compliant with the EU's Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS); and that the laptop would use an order of magnitude less power than the typical consumer netbooks available as of 2007 thus minimizing the environmental burden of power generation.\n\nThe XO-1 delivered (starting in 2007) uses environmental friendly materials, complies with the EU's RoHS and uses between 0.25 and 6.5 watts in operation.\nAccording to the Green Electronics Council's Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool, whose sole purpose is assessing and measuring the impact laptops have on the environment, the XO is not only non-toxic and fully recyclable, but it lasts longer, costs less, and is more energy efficient. The XO-1 is the first laptop to have been awarded an EPEAT Gold level rating.\n\nOther discussions question whether OLPC laptops should be designed to promote anonymity or to facilitate government tracking of stolen laptops. A June 2008 \"New Scientist\" article critiqued Bitfrost's P_THEFT security option, which allows each laptop to be configured to transmit an individualized, non-repudiable digital signature to a central server at most once each day to remain functioning.\n\nThe laptops are sold to governments, to be distributed through the ministries of education with the goal of distributing \"one laptop per child\". The laptops are given to students, similar to school uniforms and ultimately remain the property of the child. The operating system and software is localized to the languages of the participating countries.\n\nOLPC now also works directly with program sponsors from the public and private sectors to implement its educational program in entire schools and communities. As a non-profit organization, OLPC does require a source of funding for its program so that the laptops are given to students at no cost to child or to his/her family.\n\nApproximately 500 developer boards (Alpha-1) were distributed in mid-2006; 875 working prototypes (Beta 1) were delivered in late 2006; 2400 Beta-2 machines were distributed at the end of February 2007; full-scale production started November 6, 2007. Around one million units were manufactured in 2008.\n\nOLPC initially stated that no consumer version of the XO laptop was planned. The project, however, later established the laptopgiving.org website to accept direct donations and ran a \"Give 1 Get 1\" (G1G1) offer starting on November 12, 2007. The offer was initially scheduled to run for only two weeks, but was extended until December 31, 2007 to meet demand. With a donation of $399 (plus US$25 shipping cost) to the OLPC \"Give 1 Get 1\" program, donors received an XO-1 laptop of their own and OLPC sent another on their behalf to a child in a developing country. Shipments of \"Get 1\" laptops sent to donors were restricted to addresses within the United States, its territories, and Canada.\n\nSome 83,500 people participated in the program. Delivery of all of the G1G1 laptops was completed by April 19, 2008. Delays were blamed on order fulfillment and shipment issues both within OLPC and with the outside contractors hired to manage those aspects of the G1G1 program.\n\nBetween November 17 and December 31, 2008, a second G1G1 program was run through Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk. This partnership was chosen specifically to solve the distribution issues of the G1G1 2007 program. The price to consumers was the same as in 2007, at US$399.\n\nThe program aimed to be available worldwide. Laptops could be delivered in the US, in Canada and in more than 30 European countries, as well as in some Central and South American countries (Colombia, Haiti, Peru, Uruguay, Paraguay), African countries (Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Madagascar, Rwanda) and Asian countries (Afghanistan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Nepal). Despite this, the program sold only about 12,500 laptops and generated a mere $2.5 million, a 93 percent decline from the year before.\n\nOLPC no longer advertises direct to consumers, focusing instead on fundraising efforts. In 2011, they launched a new website designed by Pentagram and Upstatement.\n\n, OLPC reports 'more than 3 million laptops' have been shipped.\n\nIn October 2007, Uruguay placed an order for 100,000 laptops, making Uruguay the first country to purchase a full order of laptops. The first real, non-pilot deployment of the OLPC technology happened in Uruguay in December 2007. Since then, 200,000 more laptops have been ordered to cover all public school children between 6 and 12 years old.\n\nPresident Tabaré Vázquez of Uruguay presented the final laptop at a school in Montevideo on October 13, 2009. Over the last two years 362,000 pupils and 18,000 teachers have been involved, and has cost the state $260 (£159) per child, including maintenance costs, equipment repairs, training for the teachers and internet connection. The annual cost of maintaining the programme, including an information portal for pupils and teachers, will be US$21 (£13) per child.\n\nThe country reportedly became the first in the world where every primary school child received a free laptop on October 13, 2009 as part of the \"Plan Ceibal\" (Education Connect).\n\nUnfortunately, even though roughly 35% of all OLPC computers went to Uruguay, a 2013 study by the Economics Institute (University of the Republic, Uruguay) of the Ceibal plan concluded that use of the laptops did not improve literacy and that the use of the laptops was mostly recreational, with only 4.1% of the laptops being used \"all\" or \"most\" days in 2012. The main conclusion was that the results showed no impact of the OLPC program on the test scores in reading and math.\n\nOriginally, OLPC announced the United States would not be part of the first-year effort. In 2008, Nicholas Negroponte said \"OLPC America already has a director and a chairman and will likely be based in Washington, D.C.,\" however such an organization was not set up. As of 2010, Birmingham, Alabama is the largest deployment in the US. Some said the changing economic landscape forced OLPC to adjust their distribution strategy. Negroponte cited patriotism, \"building critical mass\", and providing a means for children all over the world to communicate.\n\nOn January 26, 2012, prime minister Ara Harutyunyan and entrepreneur Eduardo Eurnekian signed a memorandum of understanding launching an OLPC program in Artsakh. The program is geared towards elementary schools throughout Artsakh. Eurnekian hopes to decrease the gap by giving the war-zoned region an opportunity to engage in a more solid education. The New York-based nonprofit, Armenian General Benevolent Union, is helping to undertake the responsibility by providing on-the-ground support. The government of Artsakh is enthusiastic and is working with OLPC to bring the program to fruition.\n\nLagos Analysis Corp., also called Lancor, a Lagos, US-based Nigerian-owned company, sued OLPC in the end of 2007 for $20 million, claiming that the computer's keyboard design was stolen from a Lancor patented device. OLPC responded by claiming that they had not sold any multi-lingual keyboards in the design claimed by Lancor, and that Lancor had misrepresented and concealed material facts before the court. In January 2008, the Nigerian Federal Court rejected OLPC motion to dismiss LANCOR's lawsuit and extended its injunction against OLPC distributing its XO Laptops in Nigeria. OLPC appealed the Court's decision, the Appeal is still pending in the Nigerian Federal Court of Appeals. In March 2008, OLPC filed a lawsuit in Massachusetts to stop LANCOR from suing it in the United States. In October 2008, MIT News magazine erroneously reported that the Middlesex Superior Court granted OLPC's motions to dismiss all of LANCOR's claims against OLPC, Nicholas Negroponte, and Quanta. On October 22, 2010 OLPC voluntarily moved the Massachusetts Court to dismiss its own lawsuit against LANCOR.\n\nIn 2007, XO laptops in Nigeria were reported to contain pornographic material belonging to children participating in the OLPC Program. In response, OLPC Nigeria announced they would start equipping the machines with filters.\n\nIndia's Ministry of Human Resource Development, in June 2006, rejected the initiative, saying \"it would be impossible to justify an expenditure of this scale on a debatable scheme when public funds continue to be in inadequate supply for well-established needs listed in different policy documents\". Later they stated plans to make laptops at $10 each for schoolchildren. Two designs submitted to the Ministry from a final year engineering student of Vellore Institute of Technology and a researcher from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in May 2007 reportedly describe a laptop that could be produced for \"$47 per laptop\" for even small volumes. The Ministry announced in July 2008 that the cost of their proposed \"$10 laptop\" would in fact be $100 by the time the laptop became available. In 2010, a related $35 Sakshat Tablet was unveiled in India, released the next year as the \"Aakash\". In 2011, each Aakash sold for approximately $44 by an Indian company, DataWind. DataWind plans to launch similar projects in Brazil, Egypt, Panama, Thailand and Turkey.\nOLPC later expressed support for the initiative.\n\nIn 2009, a number of states announced plans to order OLPCs. However, as of 2010, only the state of Manipur had deployed 1000 laptops.\n"}
{"id": "2156088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156088", "title": "Vista Alegre (company)", "text": "Vista Alegre (company)\n\nVista Alegre is a Portuguese porcelain manufacturer located in Ílhavo in the district of Aveiro.\n\nBy May 2001, Grupo Vista Alegre joined with the Atlantis group and created the largest national tableware Group and the sixth in the world in this speciality: the \"Grupo Vista Alegre Atlantis\". Fabrica de Porcelana Vista Alegre, with its historical background and tradition is the most representative industrial unit of the eleven ones of the Group, producing around 10 million pieces a year, in decorative and domestic porcelain. In 2002 it finished an industrial re-engineering process to increase both its capacity and production volume. An integration project was also under way for the two porcelain production centres of the Group, (FPVA and Chousa Nova).\n\nInfluenced by the success of the Marinha Grande glass factory, Pinto Basto decided to create a “porcelain, glass and chemical processes” factory. He started, in 1815, by acquiring the mansion Quinta da Ermida, a beautiful place near Ílhavo town and by the Aveiro estuary, in a region rich in the essential manufacturing elements of porcelain and glass, such as fuels, clay, white and thin sands and crystallized pebbles. Later on he also bought the surrounding 100 acre (0.4 km²) premises, where he launched his project. The patent authorising the operation of the Vista Alegre Factory was granted in 1824 by King D. João VI, benefiting of “all graces, privileges and exceptions enjoyed, or to be enjoyed in the future, by the National Factories”. The, just five years later, Vista Alegre was granted the title of Royal Factory, to honor its art and industrial success. From 1832 on, the Factory intensified its work and concentrated on perfecting porcelain, reaching a golden period that culminated late in the 19th century. The contribution from foreign artists such as Victor C. Rousseau was important, mainly for the creation of a painting school. There were very relevant facts during this period of Vista Alegre's history such as the development of a social work; the introduction of golden decorations, landscape motifs and delicate flowers; the involvement in contests (Paris, Palácio de Cristal in Porto) and, finally, in 1880, the end of glass production. During the following years and until the end of World War I, the brilliant previous period tarnished by social unrest led the firm to harsh difficulties. Nevertheless, the spirit bred by the founder as well as the support of the drawing and painting school by artist Duarte José de Magalhães boosted the reorganization and modernization of the firm. And so, Vista Alegre, while celebrating its first centennial, began restructuring itself that was a landmark in the company as it became an incorporated firm, updated the Factory's structures, inaugurated two stores and boosted the design workshops. As of 1947 and until 1968, the international contacts, the formation of specialized technical teams, the purchase of both Empresa Electro-Cerâmica (its main competitor so far) and Sociedade de Porcelanas, sent Vista Alegre on the technological development and industrial path, as well as opening new markets. By the 1970s, Fábrica de Porcelana de Vista Alegre took important measures to update its technological segment and enhanced the formation of new young painters. By 1983 it created the Artistical Orientation Board, GOA in Portuguese, as for Gabinete de Orientação Artística, and in 1985, the CADE - Centro de Arte e Desenvolvimento da Empresa, to encourage creativity and to contribute to the formation in the design, painting and sculpting areas, support the Factory technically and artistically by promoting its development. The company was bought by Visabeira in 2009.\n\n"}
{"id": "2156091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156091", "title": "House of Incest", "text": "House of Incest\n\nHouse of Incest is a slim volume of 72 pages written by Anaïs Nin. Originally published in 1936, it is Anaïs Nin's first work of fiction. But unlike her diaries and erotica, \"House of Incest\" does not detail the author's relationships with famous lovers like Henry Miller, nor does it contain graphic depiction of sex. Rather, \"House of Incest\" is a surrealistic look within the narrator's subconscious mind as she attempts to escape from a dream in which she is trapped, or in Nin's words, as she attempts to escape from \"the woman's season in hell.\"\n\nNin's usage of the word incest in this case is metaphorical, not literal. In other words, in this book the word \"incest\" describes a selfish love where one can appreciate in another only that which is similar to oneself. One is then only loving oneself, shunning all differences. At first, such a self-love can seem ideal because it is without fear and without risk. But eventually it becomes a sterile nightmare. Toward the end of the book, the character called \"the modern Christ\" puts Nin's use of the word into context: “If only we could all escape from this house of incest, where we only love ourselves in the other.\"\n\nNin was under the analysis of Otto Rank during the period of writing \"House of Incest\". Rank was an early disciple of Freud, serving as the secretary and youngest member of his Vienna group, but had long since dissented from Freudian orthodoxy and developed his own theoretical school. \"Incest: From a Journal of Love\"—The Unexpurgated Diary of Anaïs Nin (1932–1934)\" reveals that the two were also having an affair.\n\nRank helped Anaïs edit \"House of Incest\". He had experience with this topic, as Otto Rank's most famous book is \"The Trauma of Birth\". \"House of Incest\" is largely an attempt by the narrator to cope with the shock of the trauma of birth. Anaïs Nin describes the process as akin to being \"[e]jected from a paradise of soundlessness... thrown up on a rock, the skeleton of a ship choked in its own sails.\"\n\nIn \"Anaïs Nin: An Introduction\", authors Duane Schneider and Benjamin Franklin V both argue that the basic theme of \"House of Incest\" is that ultimately life in the real world, which contains both pleasure and pain, is preferable to any self-created world that attempts to include only pleasure. Franklin and Schneider argue that a world consisting only of pleasure is ultimately a sterile world where intellectual, emotional, and spiritual growth is not possible, and what results is stunted people. In this, they offer the passage from \"House of Incest\" wherein Anaïs Nin writes, \"Worlds self-made and self-nourished are so full of ghosts and mosters.\"\n\nThe prose of \"House of Incest\" is considered by many to be one of the major challenges of the work. The prose and tone of the work is not linear and does not utilize everyday language. Rather, the book is written in prose that is often described as either surrealist or symbolist.\n\nDuane Schneider and Benjamin Franklin V write that the prose of \"House of Incest\" is so challenging that it requires the total attention of the reader.\n\nAs was eventually revealed in the 1990s when the unexpurgated versions of Anaïs Nin's diaries were published, Anaïs Nin claims to have had an incestuous relationship with her own father during her late 20s. It has been claimed that this incestuous relationship was encouraged by one of her therapists, who suggested that in retaliation for her father's abandonment of her during her childhood, Anaïs Nin should seduce her father in adulthood and then abandon him. In theory, this was supposed to leave Anaïs Nin feeling empowered.\n\nIt has been written that at the time of the publication of \"House of Incest,\" which took place at around the same time that Anaïs Nin was having an incestuous relationship with her father, some members of the Nin family who knew about the incestuous relationship were \"horrified\" to know that Anaïs Nin was writing a book with this title. They assumed that the book was going to be an exposé on the father/daughter incestuous relationship.\n\nAs has been discussed above, the \"incest\" referred to in the book is largely a metaphor for a type of self-love or obsession with what is the same or similar to oneself. However, Nin's relationship with her father is present in some instances, such as:\n\nThe book itself, and its meanings as well as subtleties, are derived directly from the experiences shared between herself and her father. The sameness and feeling of love for each other were in actuality the facades of a love which reflected only themselves and their similarities. Her use of the word \"incest\" is not only metaphorical in the sense that it describes such an inter-relationship between states, but between psychological aspects as well as the obviously physical interactions they may contain.\n\nOther sources claim Nin's writings in House of Incest are a symbolic representation of the passionate love affair between Nin and Henry Miller, a continuation of \"Henry and June\":\n\n\n"}

It was named after Peter Lalor, the leader of the miners at the Eureka Stockade, and a former member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly. It is a safe seat for the Australian Labor Party, which has held it for all except three years of its existence, when it was lost in the 1966 landslide. However, a redistribution ahead of the 1969 election made it a notional Labor seat. Labor retook the seat easily and has since held it without difficulty.\n\nIt has been held by a succession of senior Labor members: Julia Gillard, Prime Minister of Australia from 2010 to 2013; Barry Jones, former Minister for Science under Bob Hawke and Labor National President; and Jim Cairns, former Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister under Gough Whitlam. As Gillard was Deputy Prime Minister prior to becoming Prime Minister, Lalor is therefore the only federal electorate to have been held by two Deputy Prime Ministers.\n\nThe current member for Lalor since the 2013 election is Joanne Ryan.\n\n"}

Leslie and his two brothers (Walter and George) were the first to settle on the Darling Downs, and he was the first person to buy land in Warwick.\n\nPartick Leslie was born in Warthill, also known as Meikle Wartle in Aberdeenshire on 25 September 1815. He was the second son of William and Jane Leslie. His father was the 8th Laird of Folla and 9th Laird of Warthill, JP, DL, 27th in line of descent from the 1st Baron of Balquhain. The Leslies were members of the Church of Scotland.\n\nIn December 1834, Leslie left London as a passenger aboard the convict transport \"Emma Eugenia\", arriving in Sydney in May 1835. By 1836 he was managing Collaroi, a property owned by his uncle, Walter Stevenson Davidson, in the Cassilis district of New South Wales. Later on he rented Dunheved farm at Penrith. Leslie was a poor manager however, and his activities drew criticism from his uncle, who was forced to sell the property to his relations, E. W. T. Hamilton and George Clive, by 1840. Leslie was left deeply in debt to Davidson as a result of this episode. When his brothers Walter and George arrived in the colony, Patrick decided to look for new land to the north.\n\nIn 1840 Patrick Leslie started with stock from a New England station, then the most northerly settled district in New South Wales, and squatted Toolburra and Canning Downs (at ), the first stations on the Condamine River, before the river had been identified as a tributary of the Darling River. Leslie met explorer Allan Cunningham at the home of Hannibal Hawkins Macarthur in Parramatta. In 1840 Leslie, accompanied by a convict named Peter Murphy, followed in the footsteps of the explorer. On the return trip to Sydney he marked a trail by cutting into the trees. This became known as \"Leslie’s marked tree line\".\n\nOn his return to Sydney Leslie married Catherine (Kate), daughter of Hannibal Hawkins Macarthur, at Parramatta on 9 September 1840. His best man at the wedding was Stuart Donaldson. On 2 July 1840, the first head station was established by Walter Leslie at Toolburra. Walter and George Leslie then set about building a residence at Canning Downs. Although the three Leslie brothers claimed all the land to the head of the Condamine River, including its tributaries, they were forced to give up most of the claim to new arrivals because of the requirement that all land claimed had to be adequately stocked.\nIn 1841 Leslie and his wife traveled from Sydney to Brisbane aboard the Hunter River Steam Navigation Company steamer, \"Shamrock\". They were then counted as the first family to make the journey from Brisbane to the Darling Downs. By 1841 the Leslies had sold their interest in 'Toolburra' and moved to 'Canning Downs' which was managed by George and Walter Leslie. When the Leslies first settled on Canning Downs, they had 6000 sheep, two teams of bullocks and drays, one team of horses and a dray, 10 saddle horses, and 22 convict employees. The task of building up the property during a time of depression proved too difficult and Patrick Leslie was ruined financially by 1844.\n\nIn 1845 Leslie acquired 14 hectares of land in his father's name on the banks of Breakfast Creek, Brisbane and built Newstead House (), where he lived while pasturing flocks at Canning Downs. In 1846 he acquired 'Goomburra' on the Darling Downs. Newstead House was sold to his brother-in-law, John Clements Wickham, the following year.\nIn 1847 the New South Wales Government asked Leslie to select a site for a town on Canning Downs station. It was to be known as Canningtown, the local Aborigines knew the area as Gooragooby, but the name Warwick was eventually chosen. At the first land sale in Warwick 1848 Patrick Leslie bought the first allotment. Today much of the water supply for city of Warwick is drawn from Leslie Dam, and larger than life granite sculptures of and Patrick and Catherine Leslie are located in a park adjacent to the dam wall.\n\nIn 1851, Leslie also bought nearby Gladfield Station.\n\nIn 1854 after selling Goomburra to Robert Tooth, Leslie left Australia with his wife and son and returned to Britain.\n\nLeslie was elected as member of the NSW Legislative Assembly for the seat of Moreton, Wide Bay, Burnett and Maranoa from 19 November to 19 December 1857, when the parliament was dissolved. Leslie did not contest the 1858 election.\n\nPatrick Leslie and his family moved to New Zealand, arriving in Auckland on 20 October 1868. He purchased land in Waikato, where he established a productive farm and sheep stud at \"Wartle\", just south of Hamilton, on New Zealand's North Island. He sold his New Zealand holdings due to failing health in 1879, returning to Australia in his retirement.\n\nIn 1879 he retired to Milson's Point, Sydney, where he died on 12 August 1881 following a short illness. He was buried in plot 799 at St Thomas’ Anglican Church Cemetery in West Street, Crows Nest, Sydney. Leslie was survived by his wife, Catherine and four grandchildren.\n\nThe Leslie brothers are memorialised by a set of gates to Leslie Park in Warwick on the corner of Fitzroy and Guy Streets. These gates were taken from the Glengallan Homestead and re-erected in the Park to commemorate the centenary of the Leslie brothers establishing Canning Downs pastoral run.\n\n\n"}

It has taken place annually in Nova Scotia's capital, Halifax since 1979. It is currently held in the Halifax Scotiabank Centre.\n\nThe Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo is unique among other Tattoos in the world in that it is more theatrical in nature with a mixture of both military and civilian performers.\n\nIt takes place in the Halifax Metro Centre's hockey arena, a venue that, to some degree, resembles a traditional theatre in the round. The show is heavily costumed and intensively rehearsed with technical staff, choreographers, assistant directors, wardrobe staff and designers as part of the production team, which also sets it apart from traditional Tattoos. \n\nA recurring theme of \"Bond of Friendship\" is woven into the Nova Scotia Tattoo each year that is intended to confirm and to build international relationships. Additional themes, usually connected with military anniversaries, are added each year. \n\nThe show has been seen by well over 2,000,000 spectators and has hosted tens of thousands of performers from 21 countries. In terms of annual economic impact, it generates tens of millions for the Province of Nova Scotia and the Halifax Regional Municipality.\n\nThe Tattoo is presented by the Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo Society, which is supported by subsidies and in-kind support from the Government of Canada, the Province of Nova Scotia, the Canadian Forces, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Halifax Regional Municipality and the Corporate Community.\n\nRun mainly by volunteers, the Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo is a registered charity of Canada.\n\nThe word \"Tattoo\" is derived from Dutch \"doe den tap toe\" (translated to turn off the taps). In 17th century Dutch villages when British soldiers were required back at their barracks, a drummer would march through the streets playing the drumbeat \"doe den tap toe\". \n\nWhile the first Nova Scotia Tattoo actually took place in 1979, the event that had the greatest impact on the Nova Scotia Tattoo was the \"Canadian Armed Forces Tattoo\". As part of the Centennial Celebrations, the 1967 \"Canadian Armed Forces Tattoo\" was the largest touring show ever presented in the world. Beginning in the summer of 1967, when it was part of Canada's centennial celebrations, the \"Canadian Armed Forces Tattoo\" made stops in Victoria, Vancouver, Hamilton, Ottawa, Toronto and Montreal. The tour continued for a total of eight months.\n\nAn officer with the Black Watch, Ian Fraser, had had experience working on Tattoos because of the \"Soldiers of the Queen\" production that had been put together in 1959 at Gagetown, NB. Fraser was called to Ottawa from the Staff College in India in order to produce the \"Canadian Armed Forces Tattoo.\" \n\nFrom that successful show, Fraser was once again called upon in 1979 to mark the visit to Nova Scotia of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother by organizing a Tattoo for the \"International Gathering of the Clans\". This would be the first time the International Gathering of the Clans would take place outside Scotland. Fraser was commanded to organize the show in six months. \n\nAfter the 1979 debut, the provincial government established the Nova Scotia Tattoo as a permanent tourist attraction. This show evolved into a cultural fixture and economically important nine-day production; a mainstay in the Halifax Regional Municipality. \n\nIn recognition of how much the 1979 show had evolved on an international level, in 1988 the name was formally changed to \"The Nova Scotia International Tattoo\".\n\nOn May 4, 2006, it was announced that the Tattoo had received the designation \"Royal\" from Queen Elizabeth II. The announcement was made at Government House in Nova Scotia by Lieutenant-Governor Myra Freeman.\n\nTattoo organizers ignited a controversy in 2010 when Queen Elizabeth II canceled a special Royal Tour appearance at the Tattoo because the event organizers, citing safety reasons, refused to allow her to climb up a set of steps on the Tattoo stage. The steps were theatrical stairs and very steep with no railing.\n\n\n"}

Often this is either the deputy campaign manager or the campaign communications director. The communications director works closely with the White House press secretary, who is typically a co-worker in the president's campaign.\n\nAs the president's voice and vision must be understood, the communications director ensures that all aspects of communications are covered to ensure that the administration's message has been delivered clearly and successfully.

The communications office also works closely with cabinet-level departments and other executive agencies in order to create a coherent strategy, through which the president's message can be disseminated.\n\nWith the growing importance of the internet and new media in terms of presidential communication, the communications office has branched out to utilize the Internet, and more specifically social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, in order to reach out and convey the president's vision to a larger percentage of the public.\n\n"}

She was a victim of judicial murder committed by the communist party on fabricated charges of conspiracy and treason. The verdict of her trial was annulled in 1968, and she was fully rehabilitated in the 1990s and posthumously received the Order of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk (1st Class) and Order of the White Double Cross (1st Class).\n\nDr Horáková was born Milada Králová in Prague. At the age of 17, in the last year of the First World War, she was expelled from school for participating in an anti-war demonstration. She nevertheless completed her secondary education in the newly-formed Czechoslovakia and went on to study law at Charles University, graduating in 1926. From 1927 to 1940 she was employed in the social welfare department of the Prague city authority. In addition to focusing on issues of social justice, Horáková also became a prominent campaigner for the equal status of women. She was also active in the Czechoslovak Red Cross. In 1929 she joined the Czechoslovak National Socialist Party which, despite the similarity in names, was a strong opponent of German National Socialism.\n\nHoráková married her husband Bohuslav Horák in 1927. Their daughter, Jana, was born in 1933.\n\nAfter the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939, Horáková became active in the underground resistance movement. Together with her husband, she was arrested and interrogated by the Gestapo in 1940, in her case because of her pre-war political activity. She was sent to the concentration camp at Terezín and then to various prisons in Germany. In the summer of 1944, Horáková appeared before a court in Dresden. Although the prosecution demanded the death penalty, she was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment. She was released from detention in Bavaria in April 1945 by advancing United States forces in the closing stages of the Second World War.\n\nFollowing the liberation of Czechoslovakia in 1945, Horáková returned to Prague and joined the leadership of the re-constituted Czechoslovak National Socialist Party, becoming a member of the Provisional National Assembly. In 1946, she won a seat in the elected National Assembly representing the region of České Budějovice in southern Bohemia. Her political activities again focussed on the role of women in society and also on the preservation of Czechoslovakia's democratic institutions. Shortly after the Communist coup in February 1948, she resigned in protest from the parliament. Unlike many of her political associates, Horáková chose not to leave Czechoslovakia for the West, and continued to be politically active in Prague. On 27 September 1949, she was arrested and accused of being the leader of an alleged plot to overthrow the Communist regime.\n\nBefore facing trial, Horáková and her co-defendants were subjected to intensive interrogation by the StB, the Czechoslovak state security organ, using both physical and psychological torture. She was accused of leading a conspiracy to commit treason and espionage at the behest of the United States, Great Britain, France and Yugoslavia. Evidence of the alleged conspiracy included Horáková's presence at a meeting of political figures from the National Socialist, Social Democrat and People's parties, in September 1948, held to discuss their response to the new political situation in Czechoslovakia. She was also accused of maintaining contacts with Czechoslovak political figures in exile in the West.\n\nThe trial of Horáková and twelve of her colleagues began on 31 May 1950. It was intended to be a show trial, like those in the Soviet Great Purges of the 1930s. It was supervised by Soviet advisors and accompanied by a public campaign, organised by the Communist authorities, demanding the death penalty for the accused. The State's prosecutors were led by Dr. Josef Urválek and included Ludmila Brožová-Polednová. The trial proceedings were carefully orchestrated with confessions of guilt secured from the accused, though a recording of the event, discovered in 2005, revealed Horáková's courageous defence of her political ideals. Invoking the values of Czechoslovakia's democratic presidents, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk and Edvard Beneš, she declared that \"no-one in this country has to be made to die or be imprisoned for their beliefs.\"\n\nMilada Horáková was sentenced to death, along with three co-defendants (Jan Buchal, Oldřich Pecl, and Záviš Kalandra), on 8 June 1950. Many prominent figures in the West, notably Albert Einstein, Winston Churchill and Eleanor Roosevelt, petitioned for her life, but the sentences were confirmed. She was executed by hanging in Prague's Pankrác Prison on 27 June 1950; at the age of 48. Her reported last words were (in translation): \"I have lost this fight but I leave with honour. I love this country, I love this nation, strive for their wellbeing. I depart without rancour towards you. I wish you, I wish you...\"\n\nFollowing the execution, Horáková's body was cremated at Strašnice Crematorium, but her ashes were not returned to her family. Their whereabouts are unknown.\n\n\nThe trial verdict was annulled in June 1968 during the Prague Spring, but because of the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia that followed, Horáková's reputation was not fully rehabilitated until after the Velvet Revolution of 1989. A major thoroughfare in Prague 7, Letná, was renamed in her honour in 1990. In 1991 she was awarded the Order of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk (1st Class). 27 June, the day of her execution, was declared \"Commemoration Day for the Victims of the Communist Regime\" in the Czech Republic.\n\nOn 11 September 2008, aged 86, Ludmila Brožová-Polednová, the then sole surviving member of the prosecution in the Horáková trial, was sentenced to six years in prison for assisting in the judicial murder of Milada Horáková. Brožová-Polednová was released from detention in December 2010 due to her age and health and died on 15 January 2015.\n\nMilada Horáková's husband, Bohuslav Horák, who managed to avoid arrest in 1949, escaped to Germany and later settled in the United States. Their daughter, Jana, aged 16 at the time of her mother's execution, and subsequently raised by her aunt, joined her father in 1968.\n\nHoráková's last letters, including those to her husband and her daughter, have been published in English translation.\n\nA feature film - \"Milada\" - about the life of Milada Horáková was released in November 2017. The role of Horáková is played by the Israeli-American actress Ayelet Zurer. The English-language production is directed by the Czech-born film-maker, David Mrnka.\n\n\n"}

Nin would later say she had begun the diary as a letter to her father, Cuban composer Joaquín Nin, who had abandoned the family a few years earlier. \n\nOver the years, the diary would become Nin's best friend and confidante. Despite the attempts of her mother, therapists Rene Allendy and Otto Rank, and writer Henry Miller, to break Nin of her dependence on the diary, she would continue to keep a diary up until her death in 1977. \n\nAs early as the 1930s Nin had sought to have the diary published. Due to its size (in 1966, the diary contained more than 15,000 typewritten pages in some 150 volumes) and literary style, she would not find a publisher until 1966, when the first volume of her diary would be published, covering the years 1931–1934 in her life. The published version of her diary would be very popular among young women, making Nin a feminist icon in the 1960s. Six more volumes of her diary would follow.\n\nThe series of published diaries that made their appearance starting in 1966 are now sometimes referred to as the \"expurgated\" editions. This is because in 1986, Rupert Pole, Nin's widower and literary executor, began to publish what are now termed the \"unexpurgated\" versions of the diary. The \"unexpurgated\" versions of the diaries are more sexually frank than the versions published in the 1960s and 1970s. The expurgated editions were published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.\n\nFirst published in 1966, it depicts Nin living in Louveciennes, just outside Paris, with her husband, banker Hugh Parker Guiler. Guiler's name is not once mentioned in this volume. Volume One covers the most important years of her relationship with Henry Miller. She has just published her study of D. H. Lawrence. Many of the early entries deal with Henry and his fascinating wife June. She discusses her psychoanalytic sessions with Rene Allendy and Otto Rank at length. During this period, her father re-enters her life. By the end of this volume, Henry has published \"Tropic of Cancer\" and she had completed \"House of Incest\" (published, 1936) and \"Winter of Artifice\" (published 1939). During his time, Henry Miller started to influence the writings published in Louveciennes in 1966. Nin's impression of Miller was rather startling, as she fell in contemplation of his litteracy.\n\n\"Volume V\" was published in 1974, describes her first trip to Acapulco, the beginning of her double life in Sierra Madre, California as well as in New York, the death of her mother and the progress of her feelings and career. Her love life, including the existence of both her husbands is still deleted.\n\n\"Volume VI\" was published in 1976, and was edited by Gunther Stuhlmann. It was dedicated to the team of doctors who saved her life in January 1975. It opens with her description of the aftereffects of having taken LSD, and closes with her mentioning the publication of \"Volume I\" of her diaries and her belated recognition as a writer. Other subjects include a debate with Aldous Huxley over psychedelics, a visit to the Brussels World's Fair of 1958, and working as an editor for the magazine \"Eve\". She was a witness to the Caresse Crosby incident at Delphi.\n\nIn 1986, Rupert Pole, Nin's surviving widower and literary executor of the bigamous diarist, began to publish what are now termed the \"unexpurgated\" versions of the diary. The \"unexpurgated\" versions of the diaries are more sexually frank than the versions published in the 1960s and 1970s. The unexpurgated editions were published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich and by Swallow Press, an imprint of Ohio University Press that was the original US publisher of Nin's work.\n\n\"Henry and June\" spans a single year in Nin's life when she discovers love and torment in one insatiable couple. From late 1931 to the end of 1932, Nin falls in love with Henry Miller's writing and his wife June's striking beauty. When June leaves Paris for New York, Henry and Nin begin a fiery affair that liberates her sexually and morally, but also undermines her marriage and eventually leads her into psychoanalysis. As she grapples with her own conscience, a single question dominates her thoughts: What will happen when June returns to Paris? An intimate account of one woman's sexual awakening, Henry and June exposes the pain and pleasure felt by a single person trapped between two loves.\n\nPublished in 1993, This is the continuation of the story begun in \"Henry and June\", exposing the shattering psychological drama that drove Nin to seek absolution from her psychoanalysts for the ultimate transgression. This portion of Nin's diary, which was cut from the expurgated editions published in her lifetime, records her steamy love affair with Henry Miller in Paris, but here her intense adoration gives way to disillusionment. She describes Miller as crude, egotistic, imitative, childishly irresponsible, \"a madman.\" Her real focus, however, is her father, Joaquin Nin, a Spanish pianist and aristocratic Don Juan who seduced her after a 20-year absence. Her graphic account of their lovemaking and of her incestuous romantic feelings is fairly shocking. Nin sought absolution from her psychiatrist and lover, Otto Rank, who advised her to bed her father, then dump him as punishment for abandoning her when she was 10. Nin's ornate, hothouse prose is much rawer than the chiseled style of the expurgated diaries. She seethes with jealousy at Miller's wife June, swoons over poet and actor Antonin Artaud, neglects her protective husband, Hugh Guiler, and describes her traumatic delivery of a stillborn child. Her extraordinary, tangled self-analysis is a disarming record of her emotional and creative growth.\n\nThe third volume of Nin's provocative and provoking uncensored diaries, published in 1996, finds our madly scribbling \"femme fatale\" in New York, where she's gone to get away from her doggedly loyal husband and from adored lover Henry Miller and indulge her fancy for analyst Otto Rank. Once again, Nin is blithely honest about her profound dishonesty, admitting that she loves telling \"marvelous lies\" to the men who desire her. She tires of Rank just as Miller and her husband catch up with her, then, suddenly, enters a whole new realm of potent romance with a fiery man of Inca descent, Gonzalo More. More, a man of conscience and lyrical intensity, inspires Nin to new poetic and mystical heights. These unexpurgated volumes are of particular interest to readers of the original published versions because they fill in so many puzzling omissions, but they are also remarkable for their audacity and prolificity. Just one page of Nin's extraordinary diaries contains more sex, melodrama, fantasies, confessions, and observations than most novels, and reflects much about the human psyche we strive to repress.\n\nPublished in 1996, one would hardly know that in this part of her diaries Nin was living in a France on the brink of war. \"I dream, I kiss, I have orgasms, I get exalted, I leave the world, I float, I cook, I sew, I have nightmares, I follow a gigantic creative plan,\" she claims. Her self-description says it all. Here Nin often pauses to improve upon life, which in the two years, spent mostly in Paris, covered in this volume, consisted largely of cadging from her complaisant banker husband, Hugh Guiler, to support her lovers. One was the gaunt, bald sexual athlete and expatriate novelist, Henry Miller, who by then had parted from his wife, June. Another was the swarthy Communist activist Gonzalo More, whose appetite for sex overwhelmed his passion for politics, and whose wife, Helba Huara encouraged his income-producing infidelity. Nin betrayed all three men, even on days (and nights) when she bedded them all. In her middle 30s, her erotomania left her little time for much else, but she managed to write pornographic (and then censorable) short fiction and reams of what later skeptics called a \"liary.\" She was \"a true Catholic,\" More told her. \"You love the sin and absolution and regrets and sinning again.\" Yet she had few regrets but the unpublishability of her diaries. At the outbreak of World War II she leaves for America. She will never live in Paris again.\n\n\"Mirages,\" published in 2013 by Swallow Press, opens at the dawn of World War II, when Nin fled Paris, where she had lived for fifteen years with her husband, banker Hugh Guiler, and ends in 1947 when she meets Rupert Pole, the man who would be “the One,” the lover who would satisfy her insatiable hunger for connection. In the middle looms a period Nin describes as “hell,” during which she experiences a kind of erotic madness, a delirium that fuels her search for love. At times desperate and suicidal, Nin finds life more fulfilling when it conforms to her dreams—a series of mirages she conjures to avoid reality, the horrors of war, and an America she finds abysmally immature. Often in a state of semi-delirium where she finds herself drowning in her unconscious, she writes that she needs love so abnormally that it all seems natural to keep several relationships going at once, all the one and the same love. Her lovers included Henry Miller, 17-year-old Bill Pinckard, Edmund Wilson, and dozens of others, including an emotionally charged, but physically unfulfilled, relationship with Gore Vidal. As a child suffering abandonment by her father, Nin wrote, “Close your eyes to the ugly things,” and, against a horrifying backdrop of war and death, Nin combats the world’s darkness with her own search for light. Mirages collects, for the first time, the story that was cut from all of Nin’s other published diaries, particularly volumes 3 and 4 of \"The Diary of Anaïs Nin,\" which cover the same time period. Mirages answers the questions Nin readers have been asking for decades: What led to the demise of Nin’s love affair with Henry Miller? Just how troubled was her marriage to Hugh Guiler? What is the story behind Nin’s “children,” the effeminate young men she seemed to collect at will? Mirages is a deeply personal story of heartbreak, despair, desperation, carnage, and deep mourning, but it is also one of courage, persistence, evolution, and redemption that reaches beyond the personal to the universal.\n\n\"Trapeze,\" (2017, Swallow Press), marks the start of what Nin came to call her “trapeze life,” swinging between her longtime husband, Hugh Guiler, in New York and her lover, Rupert Pole, in California, a perilous lifestyle she continued until her death in 1977. Today what Nin did seems impossible, and what she sought perhaps was impossible: to find harmony and completeness within a split existence. It is a story of daring and genius, love and pain, largely unknown until now.\n"}

Both hyperdescent and hypodescent vary from, and may not be mutually exclusive with, other methods of determining lineage, such as patrilineality and matrilineality.\n\nUntil well into the 20th century, Australian state and federal governments engaged in a program of forcibly separating Aboriginal children with white ancestry from their Aboriginal families, and raising them in institutions that were intended to prepare them for white foster homes, jobs under white employers and/or marriage to whites.\n\nThis occurred according to theories of hyperdescent that were popular among white people. These ideas were not usually shared by Aboriginal people. White politicians and officials utilised pseudo-scientific theories that Aboriginal people were genetically and culturally inferior to whites, and were becoming extinct. These authorities believed that it was therefore improper for part-white children to live as Aboriginal people.\n\nIt was also widely believed that if Aboriginal people whose descendants had children with whites for several generations, successive generations of descendants would be less and less distinguishable from whites.\n\nIn Australia, while there were many racist laws intended to keep Aboriginal people in a socially inferior position, there were no anti-miscegenation laws and hence no barriers to marriages between Aboriginal and white partners.\n\nBrazil is an example of a country with a history of European slavery of black Africans somewhat analogous to that of the United States of America. However, in the United States, hypodescent was applied, gradually classifying anyone with African American ancestry as black, specifically in one-drop rule laws passed in Virginia and other states in the 20th century. In Brazil, by contrast, people of mixed race who were fair-skinned or were educated and of higher economic classes were accepted into the elite. Thomas E. Skidmore, in \"Black into White: Race and Nationality in Brazilian Thought\" explains that many of the Brazilian elite encouraged a national process of \"whitening\" through miscegenation. Skidmore writes (p. 55): \"In fact, miscegenation did not arouse the instinctive opposition of the white elite in Brazil. On the contrary, it was a well-recognized (and tacitly condoned) process by which a few mixed bloods (almost invariably light mulattoes) had risen to the top of the social and political hierarchy.\"\n\nHyperdescent is the rule in the rest of Latin America as well. The mestizo populations of Latin America usually consider themselves to be of European culture rather than American Indian. This is also apparent in the United States, where the practice of hypodescent is the rule among the non-Hispanic population contrasting with hyperdescent among Hispanics. Nearly half of U.S. Hispanics called themselves \"white\" in the 2000 Census, along with 80% of the population of Puerto Rico. Non-Hispanics, on the other hand, if they are of mixed race, will usually call themselves white only if they are a small fraction (1/8 or 1/16) American Indian, but otherwise will claim being of mixed race or even of the minority race. In the 2000 Census, of 35,305,818 Hispanics, only 407,073 (or just over 1%) called themselves American Indian, and only 2,224,082 (just over 6%) claimed to be of mixed race, even though these Hispanic groups (such as Mexicans) are majority mestizo in their home countries.\n\nAbout 41.2% of U.S. Hispanics identify as \"Some other race\" as of 2006, but government agencies which do not recognize \"Some other race\" (such as the FBI, the CDC, and the NCHS) include this group, and therefore over 90% of Hispanics, within the white population. In such cases, such as with the NCHS, separate statistics are often kept for \"White\" (which includes whites and over 90% of Hispanics) and \"non-Hispanic white\".\n\nAnother example of hyperdescent is in Iceland, which was initially populated by Norsemen, who took with them slaves from Ireland, Scotland and the Ancient Britons, including some women.\n\nModern Icelanders are considered to be a Scandinavian people ethnically, although many of the founding generations were Irish, Scots, or English women.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2156142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156142", "title": "Australorp", "text": "Australorp\n\nThe Australorp is a chicken breed of Australian origin, developed as a utility breed with a focus on egg laying. It achieved world-wide popularity in the 1920s after the breed broke numerous world records for number of eggs laid and has been a popular breed in the western world since. It is one of eight poultry breeds created in Australia and recognised by the Australian Poultry Standards. The most popular colour of the breed is black, which is the only colour recognised in the United States of America, but blue and white are also recognised in Australia and the Poultry Club South Africa recognises buff, splash, wheaten laced and golden in addition.\n\nThe original stock used in the development of the Australorp was imported to Australia from England out of the Black Orpington yards of William Cook and Joseph Partington in the period from 1890 to the early 1900s with Rhode Island Red. Local breeders used this stock together with judicious out-crossings of Minorca, White Leghorn and Langshan blood to improve the utility features of the imported Orpingtons. There is even a report of some Plymouth Rock blood also being used. The emphasis of the early breeders was on utility features. At this time, the resulting birds were known as Australian Black Orpingtons (Austral-orp).\n\nThe origin of the name \"Australorp\" seems to be shrouded in as much controversy as the attempts to obtain agreement between the States over a suitable national Standard. The earliest claim to the name was made by one of poultry fancy's institutions, Wiliam Wallace Scott, before the First World War. From 1925 Wal Scott set to work to have Australorp recognised as a breed with the Poultry Society as he developed the breed. Equally as persuasive a claim came in 1919 from Arthur Harwood who suggested that the \"Australian Laying Orpingtons\" be named \"Australs\". The letters \"orp\" were suggested as a suffix to denote the major breed in the fowl's development. A further overseas claim to the name came from Britain's W. Powell-Owen who drafted the British Standard for the breed in 1921 following the importation of the \"Australian Utility Black Orpingtons.\" It is certain that the name \"Australorp\" was being used in the early 1920s when the breed was launched internationally. In 1929, the Australorp was admitted to the Standard of Perfection.\n\nThere are both bantam and standard sized Australorps.\n\nThe Australorp has three recognised colours according to the Australian Poultry Standard: black, white and blue. White Australorps have been recorded since 1949 but they were only recognised in the 2nd Edition of the \"Australian Poultry Standards\" in 2011. South Africa recognises further colours; buff, splash, wheaten laced and golden.\n\nIt was the egg-laying performance of Australorps that attracted world attention when in 1922-23 a team of six hens set a world record by laying 1857 eggs for an average of 309.5 eggs per hen during a 365 consecutive day trial. These figures were achieved without the lighting regimens of the modern intensive shed. Such performances had importation orders flooding in from England, United States of America, South Africa, Canada and Mexico. Well looked after Australorps lay approximately 250 light-brown eggs per year. A new record was set when a hen laid 364 eggs in 365 days. They are also known to be good nest sitters and mothers, making them one of the most popular large, heritage utility breeds of chicken.\n\n"}

On 18 July 1452 he went into the tent of Lord Chancellor of Scotland (Crichton), where he resigned into the King's hands his lands in Ayr including Kilmaurs, as well as the sheriffdom of Ayr, and the lands of Kilmarnock in Stirling, Finlaystone in Renfrew, Glencairn in Dumfries, and Hilton in Berwick. After a pause, King James II regranted and gave the said lands to Alexander and his heirs.\n\nIn 1458 Alexander acted as Bailie of Cunningham in 1458. Alexander was subsequently accused of having dealings with the traitor Earl of Douglas, and on 13 January 1464 he complained to the King in Parliament that there was a rumor that he had assisted James of Douglas, notwithstanding a letter of February 8, 1463, from the King James III declaring him innocent. He then offered purgation by a court of his peers, by the purgation of 100 knights and esquires, or to defend himself according to the laws of arms. Parliament declared him innocent.\n\nThat is the first reference to Alexander as Lord Kilmaurs, a dignity to which he had been raised between 8 February 1463, the date of the royal letter, where he is styled Alexander Cunynghame, Lord of Kilmaurs, and 13 January 1464, when as Lord Kilmaurs he complained in Parliament. \n\nOn 15 October 1464 Alexander witnessed a charter ' Alexander Dominus Kilmaurs. On 13 January 1478 he had a charter as Alexander Dominus de Kilmaweris of his lands of Drips, in the lordship of Kilbride, Lanark. Alexander sat continually in Parliament as Lord Kilmaurs from 1464 to 1488.\n\nIn 1488 a great part of the Scottish nobles rebelled against King James III, on 2 February 1488, the prince his son, then about sixteen years of age, left Stirling Castle and joined the rebels. Alexander, Lord Kilmaurs, who was then very powerful, brought his forces to aid the King's party and assisted in the defeat of the rebels at Battle Blackness. For his service, and as a mark of Royal favor, Alexander Cuninghame, Lord Kilmaurs was, on 28 May 1488, advanced to the dignity of Earl of Glencairn by royal charter, in which he is designated Alexander, Earl of Glencairn and Lord Kilmaurs. The words used are 'facimus et creamus eundem nostrum consanguineum Comitem in exaltationem sui honoris, perpetuis futuris temporibus Comitem de Glencairn et Dominum de Kilmauris nuncupandum.' In support of this honor, the King James III, by the same deed, granted Alexander, Earl of Glencairn thirty-pound lands of Drummond and the ten-pound lands of Duchray, in the Earldom of Lennox, to be held by the Earl and his heirs and successors forever. \n\nAlter the battle of Blackness a proposal was made for a treaty between the opposite parties, and articles were drawn up for that purpose. These articles were not observed. The prince's party accused the King and others of having entered into a treaty with England. The war broke out again, and on 11 June 1488, during the Battle of Sauchieburn near Stirling, Alexander Cuninghame, Earl of Glencairn was killed. King James III was either killed during the battle or shortly thereafter. \n\nAlexander, first Earl of Glencairn, married Margaret, daughter of Adam Hepburn, Lord of Hailes.\n\nKnown children of Alexander:\n\n1. ROBERT, Master of Glencairn\n\n2. William of Craigends, ancestor of that family, and the ancestor of the Cuninghams of Robertland, Carncurin, Bedlaw, Auchinharvie, and Auchinyards.

In 1816, he traveled to the East Indies.\n\nIn May 1818, he met Alfred Duvaucel in Calcutta. Together, they moved to Chandernagore, then a trading post of the French East India Company, and started collecting animals and plants for the Paris Museum of Natural History. They employed hunters who supplied them daily with live and dead specimens, which they described, drew and classified. They also received objects from local \"rajahs\" and went hunting themselves. In the garden of their compound, they cultivated local plants and kept water birds in a basin. In June 1818, they sent their first consignment to Paris, containing a skeleton of a Ganges river dolphin, a head of a Tibetan ox, various species of little known birds, some mineral samples and a drawing of a \"tapir from Sumatra\" that they had studied in Hastings menagerie. Later consignments included a live Cashmere goat, crested pheasants and various birds.\n\nIn December 1818, Thomas Stamford Raffles invited them to accompany him on his journeys and pursue their collections in places, where he would have to go officially. He offered to establish a menagerie in his Bencoulen residence. By end of December, they left with him on the basis that would equally share the collected animals. In \"Pulo-Pinang\", they collected two new fish species and some birds. In \"Achem\", they collected only a few plants, insects, birds, snakes, fish and two deer. In Malacca, they bought a bear, an argus and some other birds. In Singapore, they obtained a dugong, of which they prepared drawings and a description that Raffles sent to the Royal Society. These were published in 1820 by Everard Home and planned for publication in the \"Histoire naturelle des mammifères\" by Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and Frédéric Cuvier. After their arrival at Bencoulen in August 1819, Raffles requisitioned most of their collection and left them copies of their drawings, descriptions and notes.

He also helped contribute with the early Roman Catholic missionaries in New France.\n\nIn February 1820, the \"Asiatick Society (Calcutta, India)\" published an article jointly written by Diard and Duvaucel entitled \"Sur une nouvelle espèce de Sorex — Sorex Glis\" including a drawing of a common treeshrew.\n\nThe Paris Museum of Natural History received nearly 2000 animals collected jointly by\nDiard and Duvaucel during their stay of more than a year in the Greater Sunda Islands. Their consignments comprised 88 mammal species, 630 bird species, 59 reptile species and contained stuffed animals, skins, skeletons, drawings and descriptions of such notable species as the Malayan tapir, Sumatran rhinoceros, Javan rhinoceros, gibbons, leaf monkeys, two previously unknown fruit bat species, tree shrews, skunks, binturong and sun bear. Several of these species were first described by French zoologists working at the Museum. Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest described the Malayan tapir in 1819; the Sunda stink badger and \"Paradoxurus hermaphroditus bondar\", a subspecies of the Asian palm civet in 1820; the Sunda pangolin, the Javan rhinoceros, the Malayan weasel, and the genus of \"Semnopithecus\" in 1822.\n\nIn 1821, Raffles published descriptions of the species jointly collected by Diard and Duvaucel in Sumatra, including first descriptions of the sun bear, the binturong, the crab-eating macaque, the Sumatran surili, the siamang gibbon, the silvery lutung, the large bamboo rat, the large treeshrew and the cream-coloured giant squirrel.\nDiard collected the first specimen of the Borneo freshwater crocodile first described as \"Crocodylus raninus\" by Salomon Müller and Hermann Schlegel in 1844. Schlegel also first described several snake species collected by Diard in Borneo.\n\nDiard is commemorated in the scientific names of a number of animals:\n\nDiard also collected the first specimen of a saltwater crocodile from Brunei.\n"}

Assuming only the quasi-delay-insensitive delay model the generated designs need little if any timing hazard testing. The basis for DIMS is the use of two wires to represent each bit of data. This is known as a dual-rail data encoding. Parts of the system communicate using the early four-phase asynchronous protocol.\n\nThe construction of DIMS logic gates comprises generating every possible minterm using a row of C-elements and then gathering the outputs of these using OR gates which generate the true and false output signals. With two dual-rail inputs the gate would be composed of four two-input C-elements. A three input gate uses eight three-input C-elements.\n\nLatches are constructed using two C-elements to store the data and an OR gate to acknowledge the input once the data has been latched by attaching as its inputs the data output wires. The acknowledge from the forward stage is inverted and passed to the C-elements to allow them to reset once the computation has completed. This latch design is known as the 'half latch'. Other asynchronous latches provide a higher data capacity and levels of decoupling.\n\nDIMS designs are large and slow but they have the advantage of being very robust.\n"}

He was also the chief of Clan Cunningham.\nThe eldest son of William Cunningham, 8th Earl of Glencairn, on 21 July 1637 this William obtained a ratification from King Charles 1st, under the Royal Sign Manual, of the original Glencairn Letters Patent of 1488.\n\nHe was sworn a member of the Privy Council of Scotland and in 1641 was appointed a Commissioner of the Treasury.\n\nThe Earl supported the Royalist cause of his King, and in 1643 joined with the Duke of Hamilton and the Earls of Lanark and Roxburgh, in opposing the sending of a Scottish army into England to assist the English Parliamentary Army. For this loyalty he received a (now published) personal letter from the King.\n\nHe was appointed Lord Justice General by parliament in 1646. He knew of and is said to have \"entered heartily into\" the attempted rescue of Charles I in 1648, and was subsequently deprived by parliament of this post on 15 February 1649, under the Act of Classes. The parliament, now being dominant, at the instance of the Public Prosecutor, then passed a Decreet, on 2 March 1650, annulling the original Glencairn Letters Patent of 1488. (This was rescinded at the Restoration).\n\nGlencairn then led an insurrection in the Highlands in 1653 \"(See: Royalist rising of 1651 to 1654)\" in favour of King Charles II, when General Monck had possession of Scotland. In January 1654 he was\ncommissioned by Charles II to command the Royal forces in all of Scotland, numbering some 3,500 men, pending the arrival of General Middleton. The insurrection of that year is generally known as \"Glencairn's rising\", although he later handed his command to Middleton.\nAbout this time Glencairn and Lieutenant-General Sir George Munro, 1st of Newmore engaged in a duel with both pistols & swords two miles to the south of Dornoch. Munro had poured scorn on the quality of their forces and Glencairn had defended them, challenging Munro, who lost but was only wounded. Middleton initially placed the Earl under arrest, but the Earl left the army a fortnight later.\n\nHe was then arrested by Monck in 1655, who later permitted him to return home. Glencairn was excepted from Cromwell's Act of Grace and Pardon.\n\nHe was one of the peers whom Monck called to the Convention he summoned when he was about to march into England in 1659. It was at this Convention that Glencairn called for Monck to declare for a free parliament.\n\nUpon the Restoration Glencairn waited upon King Charles II at London, when he was again sworn a Privy Councillor and appointed Sheriff Principal of Ayrshire. On 19 January 1661, he was constituted Lord Chancellor of Scotland for life, upon the resignation of the Earl of Loudoun.\n\nGlencairn was Chancellor of the University of Glasgow from 1660, and was one of the principal advisors of the re-establishment of Episcopacy in Scotland. He was not, however, opposed to Presbyterianism, and the subsequent bitter disputes between the two religious factions, and particularly against James Sharp, Archbishop of St Andrews, greatly distressed him and affected his health.\n\nThe Earl died at Belton, East Lothian, on 30 May 1663, aged 54 years. According to some sources he was buried, with great pomp, in the south-east aisle of St. Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh, on 28 July following. He had a daughter, Margaret, who married in 1662, John Hamilton, 2nd Lord Bargany, a descendant of James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran (1517–1575).\n\nAccording to other sources, he was/is not buried in St Giles Cathedral Edinburgh. It was not a burial Church but it does contain memorials of other celebrated Scots. In the old kirkyard, now a carpark, were buried John Knox and William Forbes. \n\n\nThis article incorporates material from a source in the public domain. \n"}

Owned and operated by Wuhan Metro Group Co., Ltd., the network now includes 9 lines, 228 stations, and of route length. Line 1, the first line in the system, opened on , which made Wuhan become the seventh city in mainland China with rapid transit system, after Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Changchun, and Dalian. Line 2 opened on and is the first underground rail line crossing the Yangtze River. Commuting across the Yangtze River and Han River has been the bottleneck of Wuhan traffic. However, the appearance of Wuhan Metro greatly relieved this problem. With 1.22 billion annual passengers in 2019, Wuhan Metro is the sixth-busiest rapid transit system in mainland China. There are a number of lines or sections under construction. The government of Wuhan City promised the citizens that at least two lines or sections open every year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire network was out of service from 23 January 2020 to 27 March 2020.\n\nPreliminary studies of urban rail transit systems were prompted by the city shortly after a Belgian Railways delegation visit in 1984. Following the demolition of old Beijing-Hankou Railway, the city of Wuhan planned to utilize the corridor to construct the city's first rapid transit rail line. In September 1992, the Wuhan Metro Construction Group was established by Wuhan Municipal Construction Commission and a supervision group, led by the mayor Qian Yunlu, was subsequently formed in 1993 to facilitate the project's funding, planning, logistics, and organization. Yet, it was seven years before the city was able to fund construction.\n\nIn October 1999, the National Planning Commission (predecessor of the National Development and Reform Commission) approved the Wuhan \"Light Rail\" project (Line 1, phase 1), signalling the start of serious work on the rail transit project. On October 2, 2000, the Wuhan Municipal Government ratified the establishment of the Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd., and contracted construction, operation, administration and related real estate development to the corporation.\n\nIn December 2000, the National Planning Commission accepted a feasibility report on the project and approved construction on phase 1 of Line 1. On December 23, 2000, the project broke ground and comprehensive construction began.\n\nIn 2002, with the anticipation of an economic boom and increasing demand for urban rail transit, Wuhan Municipal Government approved the city's first long-term rail transit master plan. On July 28, 2004, the ten-station long \"light rail\" line was opened to the public and entered revenue service in August. However, low ridership discouraged the city from funding the extension project, for which ground had been broken on December 15, 2005, and a 4-year delay in construction ensued. In April 2006, the NDRC ratified a six-year construction/operation plan, but it was not until a year later on April 9, 2007, that NDRC accepted the feasibility report for line 1, phase 2 (the extension project) and approved construction on the project.\n\nIn the interim, construction began on the Fanhu station of the fully underground line 2 on November 16, 2006, as a response to the six-year plan adopted by NDRC earlier. Construction also began on the underground line 4 stations of Wuchang railway station in June, and Wuhan railway station in September, as parts of the integral capital project to revamp and construct the Wuhan Railway Hub.\n\nIn May 2007, the Hubei Provincial Development and Reform Commission (HDRC) approved preliminary designs on Line 1, phase 2, and comprehensive construction subsequently commenced in June. On May 15, the city government approved the establishment of Wuhan Metro Group Co., Ltd., which would replace the Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd and assume its responsibilities and benefits.\n\nOn September 12, 2007, the NDRC accepted the feasibility report to Line 2, phase 1, and preliminary designs were approved by the HDRC in December 2007. However, it was not until September 2008 that land purchases and funding were facilitated and comprehensive construction began to take place. In October 2009, drilling of the Yangtze River tunnel started.\n\nOn March 13, 2009, the NDRC accepted a feasibility report to Line 4, phase 1. On May 13, 2009, the HDRC ratified preliminary designs on Line 4, phase 1. Comprehensive construction ensued on the Wuchang segment of Line 4. A more ambitious urban rapid transit plan was submitted for NDRC review in October 2009, and in late November, on-site panel investigations were conducted by China International Engineering Consulting Corporation.\n\nIn February 2010 (Wuhan Metro)'s first commercial property topped out in Hanxi 1st Road station. On July 29, Line 1 phase 2 entered revenue service from Dijiao to Dongwu Boulevard. Despite plans to extend the westernmost terminus to Jinshan Avenue in Dongxihu District, the station was never built. A short stub with crossover tracks was constructed behind Dongwu Boulevard. Zhuyehai, a station in Qiaokou District, remained non-operational in spite of the existence of complete platforms. Neither exits nor staircases had been built yet. It was due to open when the Wuhan IKEA store was completed in late 2014.\n\nA revised and more detailed construction plan was accepted by the NDRC on January 31, 2011. The plan specified the city's plan to complete construction on Line 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 before 2017. Beginning on March 1, Line 1 subdivided its fare zones from 3 to 5 and lowered maximum fare from 5 CNY / ride to 4 CNY / ride. Wuhan Tong cardholders will receive a 20 percent discount on single ride fares. On April 9, Line 1 welcomed its 100,000,000th customer, who was awarded a one-year pass to the Metro. On September 9, preliminary designs on Line 4, phase 2 (Hanyang segment) was approved by HDRC.\n\nOn February 17, 2012, the NDRC accepted a feasibility report on line 3, phase 1, the fourth line in Wuhan Metro's grid and the first to cross the Han River, connecting the boroughs of Hankou and Hanyang. A feasibility report to Line 6—the second Hankou-Hanyang connection—was also approved by the NDRC on December 21, 2012. Seven days later, line 2 entered revenue service, connecting some of the most populated areas of Hankou, Wuchang, and the Optics Valley.\n\nOn April 12, 2013, the NDRC granted acceptance to a feasibility report of Line 8, phase 1, which connects Hankou and Wuchang via the Second Yangtze River Bridge corridor. Construction began in June 2013 and was completed in December 2017.\n\nOn 23 January 2020, the entire metro network was shut down, along with all other public transport in the city, including national railway and air travel, to halt the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in Hubei. \n\nOn 28 March 2020, six lines (Line 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7) resumed operations, after a two-month lockdown. On , Line 8 Phase 1 resumed operations. On , Line 8 Phase 3, Line 11, Yangluo line resumed operations.\n\nLine 1 is a elevated urban rail line entirely located in the borough of Hankou. It runs a northwest–southeast route that approximately parallels with Jiefang Avenue for its entire length. There are 27 planned stations, among which 25 are operational. Line 1 operates 33 four-car train sets, 12 of which are manufactured by Changchun Railway Vehicles, and 21 by Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Co., Ltd.\n\nOn July 28, 2004, the first phase of Line 1 began service from Huangpu Road to Zongguan. On July 28, 2010, Line 1 extended from both ends after the completion of phase 2. The phase 3 expansion, which extends the northeast terminus to Hankou North Station, entered revenue service on May 28, 2014. The phase 4 expansion, which extends to Jinghe Station from Dongwu Boulevard. The phase 4 opened on Dec 26th, 2017. Line 1's color is blue.\n\nLine 2 is a underground subway connecting the boroughs of Hankou and Wuchang. Upon completion, Line 2 was the first subway in China to cross the mighty Yangtze River. It runs in a northwest–southeast route and crosses the Yangtze River near Jianghan Road, and Jiyuqiao in Wuchang. Tunnel drilling concluded on February 26, 2012. Revenue service of Line 2 began on December 28, 2012. Line 2 operates 41 six-car train sets, all of which were manufactured by Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Co., Ltd.\n\nLine 2 is set to be extended towards both directions. The southern extension will bring the southeast terminus from Optics Valley Square to 6th Gaoxin Road, and the northwest extension plan will bring the northwest terminus from Jinyintan to Wuhan Tianhe International Airport, providing convenient access for airport and residential areas en route. Early on, construction work on both extensions was expected to commence in 2013, and the tentative completion dates was set at 2015. In May 2014, it was reported that the construction work on the southern extension would start within 2014, with was the completion by February 19, 2019. Line 2's color is pink.\n\nOverall construction of Line 3 was approved by National Development and Reform Commission on Feb 23, 2012, and officially started on Mar 31, 2012. Line 3 went into operation on December 28, 2015. Line 3's color is dark yellow. Line 3 cars are Type B and manufactured by CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles.\n\nLine 4 is mostly underground. It will run in an east–west route serving the Hanyang and Wuchang distincts. The first phase linking Wuchang and Wuhan railway stations opened on December 28, 2013; since that day, all three main railway stations of Wuhan are connected by the Metro. The second phase of Line 4 will crossing the Yangtze River to Hanyang opened in 2014. Line 4's color is light green. Line 4 cars are Type B and manufactured by CRRC Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive.\n\nLine 6 opened in 2016.\nAnd it is the first line of Wuhan Metro to use high capacity A size trains with overhead lines. Line 6's color is green. Line 6 uses Type A cars manufactured by CRRC Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive.\n\nLine 7 is a rapid transit line in Wuhan. The line runs from Garden Expo North in Dongxihu District to Qinglongshan Ditiexiaozhen in Jiangxia District. It serves residential & business areas such as Nanhu, Wuhan CBD and Wuhan Financial street. Line 7 reserves Wuhan Metro's highest capacity rolling stock to date featuring 8 Type-A car train sets accommodating 2480 people, compared to the standard 6 cars found on other lines. It is also the fastest urban line in the system, with trains capable of reaching the speed of 100 km/h (62 mph) compared to 80 km/h (50 mph) on other lines. \n\nFull-scale construction was approved by National Development and Reform Commission on April 24, 2013. It was opened to the public on Dec 26, 2017. Line 8's color is grey. Line 8 uses Type A cars manufactured by CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles.\n\nLine 11 was opened on 1 October 2018 on National Day. Line 11 uses Type A cars manufactured by CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles.\n\nThe Yangluo Line is a rapid transit line that forms part of the Wuhan Metro system. Coloured magenta on the metro map, the line in its current form runs from Houhu Boulevard to Jintai, a total distance of . The line connects the urban area of Hankou and Yangluo, Xinzhou District.\n\nShort turns are used on Line 2, Line 4, and Line 7, while the other lines only operate the full length of the route. As far as Line 2, Line 4, and Line 7 are concerned, the short turns alternate with the full routes. \nThe operating hours start at 6:00 on weekdays and 6:30 on weekends & holidays. The last trains of Yangluo Line depart from the terminis at 22:00 or 22:30, while other lines at 23:00. See the table below for more details. \nFares vary based on the distance travelled.\nMost Passagers enter and exit the system using a proximity card called Wuhan Tong, which is available at all metro stations. Passagers who pay for metro fare with a Wuhan Tong Card can receive a 10% discount.Besides the metro, Passengers can also pay for tram, bus, and ferry fees by Wuhan Tong within Wuhan.\n\nThere are three kinds of multi-day pass cards valid for one, three, and seven days respectively. \nCardholders may enjoy one, three, or seven days of unlimited rides in the metro system. The multi-day pass cards are available at the Customer Service Centres in the metro stations. In addition, a RMB 20 deposit is charged for each multi-day pass card.\n\n4G LTE services are provided in all stations and trains. As Line 1 was put into operation earlier, it lacks in some facilities. For more amenity information, plsease see the table below. It is worth mentioning that most of the restrooms are set outside the paid area.\n\nWuhan Metro Line 1 is the first one equipped with moving block system in China. All the lines are equipped with CBTC. In the future, a fully automated, driverless train system (GoA4), provided by Traffic Control Technology Corporation Limited, will be applied to Line 5.\n\nSince 2012, the ridership of the entire network has grown because there are new lines or sections coming into operation every year. The following data were published by the Wuhan Statistics Bureau, however, the data before 2007 is unavailable.\n\nA number of lines are under construction. Line 12 will be a loop line. Line 5 is proposed to use automated driverless trains. Line 9, 10, as well as Line 13, are being planned by the municipal authority.\n\nAlmost all stations, except the stations on Line 1, are equipped with platform screen doors. There is a plan that stations on Line 1 will be equipped with platform screen doors in the future. The metro stations are equipped to be disabled and elderly friendly, with automatic fare collection system, announcement system, electronic display boards, escalators and lifts. The stations are equipped with non-slippery flooring with grip-rails, audio announcements and Braille facilities to help visually challenged passengers. \n\n\n"}

It is on the south side of the main island, Tongatapu, 20 km from the capital of Tonga, Nukualofa. Although named after the nearby village of Fuaʻamotu, which is on Tungī's (the king's) estate, in reality the airfield is located on the Tui Pelehake's estate, closer to the village of Pelehake (which did not yet exist as a village during the early aviation days).\n\nThe air field was constructed by Seabees of the 1st Construction Battalion with assistance and labor of the U. S. Army 147th Infantry Regiment. It was intended as a World War II heavy bomber field, and had three coral-surfaced runways. In the late 1970s, it was expanded to permit jet aircraft to use the runways. Fuaamotu is now suitable for up to Boeing 767 size aircraft, but remains closed to larger jets (e.g., 747s).\n\nFuaamotu International Airport is equipped with VOR/DME (114.5) and NDB (245) navigational facilities. No ILS is available. Lighting is provided for the runway, apron, and taxiway. International airlines with regular services to Fuaamotu include Air New Zealand, Fiji Airways and Virgin Australia. Fiji Airways flies Boeing 737-800 aircraft from Nadi and ATR 42-500 aircraft from Suva (operated by Fiji Link). Air New Zealand flies Airbus A320 and Boeing 787 aircraft from Auckland. In March 2016, Air New Zealand announced plans to serve Fuaamotu with a one-off Boeing 787-9s for the Auckland–Tonga route due to demand on June 15, 2016. Virgin Australia flies a Boeing 737-800 from Sydney and Auckland. Under Tongan law, Fuaamotu International Airport is closed on Sundays — only to be opened in distress, after the minister's approval.\n\nFuaamotu is a total controlled aerodrome and all traffic are guided by air traffic control. The tower is contactable on 118.5, and Ground on 121.9. Outside of the hours of service at Fuaamotu a limited FIS is available by Auckland Oceanic.\n\nRunway 11/29: (Elev 91 ft/28m) PCN 45 FBXT (Flexible pavement, medium subgrade strength, medium tyre pressure (), technical evaluation completed). Runway End Identifier Lights are installed at each end of the runway, as are T-VASI glidescope indicators. Low Intensity Runway Lighting is provided, and a simple Low Intensity Lighting Approach Lighting System is installed on Runway 11.\n\nIt is the strength of the runway rather than the length that restricts operations from Fuaamotu. Even a fully laden Boeing 767-300ER on a flexible pavement B strength, such as at this airport, requires a Pavement Classification Number (PCN) of 59, therefore is not allowed to takeoff with full load. The same can be said of a Boeing 747-400, which theoretically could take off and land at Fuaamotu length-wise, but needs a PCN of 66, and would therefore damage the runway severely in the process (A B747-400 weighs over twice as much as a B767-300ER).\n\nThere is no public bus service to the airport, but several hostels and hotels in Nukualofa meet flights and taxis are available.\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by Kongsue & Xeng Xiong, through licensee Asian American Broadcasting, LLC.\n\nOn July 21, 2010, former owner Clear Channel Communications announced it would donate the station through the Minority Media and Telecommunications Council (MMTC)-Clear Channel Ownership Diversity Initiative. In September 2011, the station switched to an ethnic-based format catering to the local Hmong-American community.\n\nKFXN is essentially a daytime-only station, broadcasting at 500 watts, though it does have a four watt signal during nighttime hours with very limited reach. This is likely to protect CKGM in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The transmitter and three-tower antenna array are located in New Hope on Winnetka Avenue north of 36th Avenue. This has been the only transmitter location for the station since it signed on the air on April 5, 1962. In August 2009, KHTC (96.3 FM) relocated its transmission facilities from Watertown to the KFXN site.\n\nThe station signed on in 1962 with the KTCR call sign, and a country music format. In 1968, new owner Al Tedesco purchased a companion FM station, KWFM, renaming it KTCR-FM.\n\nIn 1983, both stations were sold to John and Kathleen Parker, who gave the stations a makeover. The FM was changed to an adult album alternative/new-age music format as KTCZ-FM, and KTCR became jazz as KTCJ to complement 'Cities 97'. The AM's jazz format lasted several years and the station was among the early market adopters of AM stereo, but eventually ceded to a simulcast with KTCZ-FM. On April 17, 1997, KTCJ, the sole remaining AM simulcasting an FM in the market, switched to classic country music.

{"id": "2156220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156220", "title": "Tema", "text": "Tema\n\nTema is a city on the Bight of Benin and Atlantic coast of Ghana. It is located east of the capital city; Accra, in the region of Greater Accra, and is the capital of the Tema Metropolitan District. As of 2013, Tema is the eleventh most populous settlement in Ghana, with a population of approximately 161,612 people – a marked decrease from its 2005 figure of 209,000. The Greenwich Meridian (00 Longitude) passes directly through the city. Tema is locally nicknamed the \"Harbour City\" because of its status as Ghana's largest seaport. It consists of 25 different communities which are numbered accordingly with each of them having easy access to the basic amenities. \n\nTema is a city constructed on the site of a small fishing village. Tema was commissioned by Ghana's first president, Kwame Nkrumah, and grew rapidly after the construction of a large harbour in 1961. The Tema metropolis was designed, planned and developed by the award-winning urban planner and Ghana's first architect, Theodore S. Clerk. It is now a major trading centre, home to an oil refinery and numerous factories, and is linked to Accra by a highway and railway. Tema is one of Ghana's two deep seaports, the other being Sekondi-Takoradi. Tema became an Autonomous Council in 1974 and was elevated to the status of a Metropolitan Assembly in December 1990. Tema metropolitan forms part of the sixteen (16) Metropolis, Municipalities and Districts in the Greater Accra Region. The Metropolitan shares boundaries with Ashaiman Municipal, Adenta Municipal District, and Ledzokuku-Krowor Municipal District to the west respectively, to the east with Kpone Katamanso District, to the North with Dangme West District and to the South with the Gulf of Guinea.\n\nTema was built on the site of a small fishing village called Torman, named for the local name of the calabash plant, Tor, which was cultivated there. \"Tema\" is derived from a corruption of \"Torman\". The government identified the site before independence, and in 1952 acquired of land north of the harbour, which was entrusted to the Tema Development Corporation for the new industrial and residential development. The villagers of Torman migrated to a new fishing ground around away, which they called Newtown.\n\nThe main Tema Township was constructed, and the Tema Harbour officially opened, in 1962. Over the following decades, Tema grew into the industrial hub of Ghana, with a carefully constructed road layout featuring landscaping and street lights. It boasted modern recreational centres and other social amenities rare among African cities at the time. President Nkrumah appointed Theophilus Asiaw Mills as the first District Commissioner. The importance of Tema as a port and industrial hub is reflected by the fact that the Ghana Police Service maintains a special policing region devoted entirely to the city.\n\nA large population influx began in the 1960s owing to the town's employment opportunities, but the Tema Development Corporation was unable to construct housing and provide other services to meet the needs of the migrants. The Tema Newtown district was overwhelmed by the sudden population growth, and became the poor cousin of Tema Township, receiving none of the latter's improved housing, geometrically laid roads, or social amenities. Moreover, royalties paid by Tema Newtown's companies to evicted villagers have not been used due to a chieftain dispute. The area's fishing potential was thus not fully exploited.\n\nTema is characterised by a hot semi-arid climate under the Köppen climate classification (Köppen climate classification: BSh). It lies in the driest part of southern Ghana, experiencing average annual rainfall of about . Average temperatures are high year-round, often exceeding 30° Celsius.\n\nThe town's chief industrial products include aluminium, steel, processed fish, refined petroleum, textile, chemicals, food products, and cement. Major companies operating in Tema include Volta Aluminium (VALCO), Tema Oil Refinery (TOR), Nestlé Ghana Ltd., Wahome Steel Ltd, Tema Shipyard. There is also a Free zone enclave in Tema.\n\nTema Port, which was opened in 1962, is the biggest of the two seaports in Ghana. It has a water-enclosed area of and a total land area of . Apart from handling Ghanaian imports and exports, it is also a traffic junction, dealing with transit cargo destined for the landlocked countries of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. The port of Tema handles 80% of Ghana's import and export cargo, including the country's chief export, cacao.\n\nThe port has of breakwaters, 12 deepwater berths, an outsize oil tanker berth, a dockyard, warehouses, and transit sheds. The port has open and covered areas for the storage of cargo, including a 77,200-m² (7.72-hectare) paved area for the storage of containers, steel products and other conventional cargo. The port's container yard is capable of holding over 8,000 TEUs at any given time. The closed storage area, which is about 25,049 m² (2.51 hectares) in area, consists of six sheds with a total storage capacity of 50,000 tonnes of cargo. The port also includes a 100,000-dwt dry dock and slipway facility. The harbour is operated by the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority.\n\nGhana has a long history of fishing. The Tema fishing harbour is at the eastern end of the town's commercial harbour. It comprises the Inner Fishing Harbour, the Canoe Basin, the Outer Fishing Harbour, and a commercial area with marketing and cold storage facilities.\n\nThe Inner Fishing Harbour was constructed along the Tema Main Port in 1962 to provide a handling facility for semi-industrial and industrial fishing vessels, and to encourage the development of the local fishing industry. In 1965, the Outer Fishing Harbour was constructed for bigger industrial vessels such as trawlers, tuna vessels, and deep-sea carriers. The trawlers operating in the area are 30–45 m long and are able to land 55–65 tonnes of fish (usually redfish and club and scad mackerel) per fishing trip. The tuna vessels range from smaller boats around 45–50 m in length, able to land 200–250 tonnes of catch, to larger versions with a length of 50–65 m and the ability to land up to 650 tonnes per fishing trip. The largest fishing vessels, the deep-sea carriers (with lengths of 90–105 m), are mostly chartered vessels. Since 1984, the national catch has averaged about 200,000 to 300,000 metric tonnes per annum. Ghana's tuna catch has maintained a stable level of 30,000 tonnes per annum since 1981.\n\nThe Canoe Basin caters for the artisanal fishermen. The basin is normally occupied by about 400 canoes. These are mainly two types: wooden vessels, locally called \"Legelege\", and metallic vessels. The wooden canoes have lengths over all (LOA) ranging between 30–70 m, mainly owned and operated by indigenous Ghanaians. Their operations peak during the months of June–September. Artisanal canoe fishing is responsible for about 70% of the catch.\n\nSOS-Hermann Gmeiner International College (SOS-HGIC), a private mixed boarding school catering to the 10th to 13th grades, is located in Tema. It previously used the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) for the 10th and 11th grades and the International Baccalaureate (IB) for the 12th and 13th grades but currently runs the full IB Diploma program for all four grades. The school was headed by Margaret Nkrumah for over 15 years, and is now headed by Mr Israel Titi Ofei and Nii Amaa Akita. Tema also has an international school, Tema International School (TIS), which is second to HGIC, and a senior high school, Tema Secondary School (TSS or Temasco), which was built in 22 September 1961. Tema has a number of public Secondary schools such as Chemu Senior High School in Community 4, Tema Methodist Day School, Mahean Senior High School, Our Lady of Mercy Senior High School and Tema Technical Institute. \nPrivate Preparatory Schools like Creator Schools, St Paul Methodist Primary and JHS, Marbs Preparatory School, Datus School Complex, Deks Educational Institute, Angel School Complex, Naylor SDA School, Tema Christian Centre, Tema Parents Association, First Baptist School, Tema Regular Baptist School, Queen Esther School, Dorsons School, Adwen Memorial, Creator Montessori, New Covenant School, St Alban's School, Lorenz Wolf School, Bexhill School Complex, Life International School, Mazon Grace Academy, Santabarbera School, Angels Specialist School, First Star Academy, Pentecost School, Star School Complex, Tema Ridge, St John Bosco School and Rosharon School.\nPublic primary and Junior High schools exist in Tema.

Although it is commonly reported that Rakowitz graduated from a Rockport high school, he actually attended and graduated from high school in Refugio, Texas.\n\nHe moved to New York City around 1985. Rakowitz, an eccentric well known to his East Village neighbors as a marijuana dealer and owner of a pet rooster, founded his own religion - the Church of 966.\n\nIn 1989, he walked around the East Village around Tompkins Square Park bragging to some of the people he believed were his disciples that he had killed his roommate and girlfriend, Monika Beerle, a Swiss student at the Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance, and a dancer at Billy's Topless. By his own confession, he dismembered her body in the bathtub, boiled the parts, and served some of her remains in the form of a soup to the homeless in nearby Tompkins Square Park. He said that he had boiled her head and made soup from her brain. He had tasted it and liked it, and thereafter he referred to himself as a cannibal. At least one of the people to whom he told his tale went to police. Rakowitz was arrested shortly thereafter, and led the police to the Port Authority Bus Terminal storage area, where he had stored her skull and teeth.\n\nOn February 22, 1991, a New York jury found Rakowitz, then 31 years old, not guilty by reason of insanity for the killing of his roommate on August 19, 1989.

At the age of 16, he was apprenticed for six years to the shipbuilders \"\"Robert Steele & Sons\"\" of Greenock. After he had completed his apprenticeship he returned to Wick and started his own shipbuilding yard in Pulteneytown, near Wick Harbour, where he built 56 or more vessels, ranging in size from 45 tons to 600 tons. At this time, he also became well known throughout the United Kingdom for his skills in rescuing sunken and stranded vessels. When there was an insurrection in Wick he treated the injuries of combatants from both sides and was tried for Sedition as a consequence. His peers found him Not Guilty and he was carried from the court on the shpoulders of the cheering local populace.\n\nWhen, in 1846, Brunel's SS Great Britain went aground on the sands of Dundrum Bay, Ireland, it is to his son, Alexander Bremner, that Brunel turned for help after various leading salvage experts had either declared the salvage impossible or had failed in an attempt. Alexander called in his father to develop a successful methodology. The method used by Bremner was later used to refloat her off a beach in South Georgia over a century later, after which she was brought back to her final resting place as a tourist attraction in Bristol. He frequently corresponded with Thomas Telford and was employed by Brunel as an engineering consultant when he built the Blackwall Tunnel under the Thames.\n\nHis career involved the rescue of perhaps 236 or more stricken vessels. As well as building and rescuing ships, he worked on 19 harbour structures in Scotland, not least an extension to Telford's harbour in Wick Bay. He had watched Winter gales destroy harbour walls by lifting and working loose the hortizontally laid stones. When he rebuilt the walls he simply relaid them on their ends to eliminate this structural weakness.\n\nBremner became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1833, and he was awarded the Telford Medal for several of his papers on engineering.\n\nBremner married early in his life and had numerous sons and daughters. His wife died in 1856 and Bremner himself died in the August of the same year. In 1903 a tall obelisk was erected to his memory on high ground overlooking Wick Harbour, where it stands to this day.\n"}

The album features two original songs and covers of material by Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, John Lennon, George Harrison and Richie Havens. The record has a very strong anti-war message, while also protesting public apathy towards the political process.\n\nAfter being off the road for a few months, by February 2005, the Junkies decided it was time to get together and record some music. They invited the Timmins' older brother, John Timmins, to bring his guitar and sit in. The theme the band decided on was to be on war, violence, fear, greed, ignorance, or loss, and everybody had to bring two or three songs written by other people. The Junkies played and interpreted the works of others and recorded their sessions, over the course of five days. The album was recorded at the Cowboy Junkies recording studio, The Clubhouse during February and March of 2005. The genesis of the album were a pair of songs that the Junkies had taken to their heart, \"Isn't It a Pity\" by George Harrison which they started performing on the \"Long Journey Home Tour\" the previous year, and \"December Skies\" which was written and recorded in October 2002 during the \"One Soul Now\" sessions and inspired by \"The Wars\" by Timothy Findley. The other original song on the album, \"This World Dreams Of\" was also written during the \"One Soul Now\" session, but they never got a recording they liked. For this recording, they slowed down the song, spacing it out and letting it breathe. One line from the song, \"more things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of\", is from a Tennyson poem called \"The Passing of Arthur\", which inspired the writing of the song. The song \"I Don't Want to Be a Soldier\" is unusual for the Junkies because it has a rap break in the song. The band was jamming on the song, and they set up a drum loop. When they listened to their session, they realized there was a hip-hop motion to the loop, so they invited a friend of theirs, Kevin Bond, also known as Rebel, to improvise and record a rap element, using the album themes as a basis. The Junkies then asked Jeff Wolpert to mix the elements together.\n\nCowboy Junkies\n\nAdditional musicians\n\nProduction\n\n"}

It is primarily the home to Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, although the airfield supports several other flying and non-flying units as well. Its name is an amalgamation of its location and the last name of Commander Louis H. Maxfield, who lost his life when the R-38/USN ZR-2 airship crashed during flight on 24 August 1921 near Hull, England.\n\nWhen it was consolidated with McGuire Air Force Base and Fort Dix in October 2009, it became the naval component of JB MDL – a United States Air Force–controlled installation – and was placed under the 87th Air Base Wing. However, as with all joint bases, the installation receives support services from the previous installation authorities. Thus, Lakehurst Field is also provided certain services from Naval Support Activity Lakehurst (NSA Lakehurst), whose commander also serves as one of two Base Deputy Commanders.\n\nThe field was the site of the 1937 \"Hindenburg\" disaster. \n\nLakehurst Maxfield Field's history began as a test range for ammunition being manufactured for the Imperial Russian Army in 1916. It was then acquired by the United States Army as Camp Kendrick during World War I. The United States Navy purchased the property in 1921 for use as an airship station and renamed it Naval Air Station Lakehurst (NAS Lakehurst).\n\nThe United States Navy's lighter-than-air program was conducted at Lakehurst from its inception through the 1930s. NAS Lakehurst was the center of airship development in the United States and housed three of the U.S. Navy's four rigid airships, (ZR-1) \"Shenandoah\", (ZR-3) \"Los Angeles\", and (ZRS-4) \"Akron\". A number of the airship hangars built to berth these ships still survive. Hangar One, in which the \"Shenandoah\" was built, held the record for the largest \"single room\" in the world. According to an article in the January, 1925 issue of \"National Geographic Magazine\", the airship hangar \"could house three Woolworth Buildings lying side by side.\" The base also housed many Navy non-rigid airships, otherwise knowns as \"blimps,\" in several squadrons before, during, and after World War II. This included the U.S. Navy's ZPG-3W (EZ-1C), which was deactivated in September 1962. In 2006, after a 44-year hiatus, the U.S. Navy resumed airship operations at Lakehurst with the MZ-3.\nThe installation was the site of the LZ 129 \"Hindenburg\" disaster on 6 May 1937. Despite the notoriety and well-documented nature of this incident, today there is a simple memorial that denotes the location of the crash at then–NAS Lakehurst in the field behind the large airship hangars on base. A ground marker, painted black, and rimmed by a bright yellow painted chain, locates where the gondola of the German zeppelin \"Hindenburg\" hit the ground.\n\nLakehurst conducts the unique mission of supporting and developing the Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment and Support Equipment for naval aviation. Since the 1950s, aviation boatswain's mates have been trained at Lakehurst to operate catapults and arresting systems on aircraft carriers using rail guided jet donkeys pushing dead loads at 200 knots tested carrier arresting gear cables and tailhooks. The Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System and the Advanced Arresting Gear system that will replace the existing steam catapults and the Mk-7 arresting gear are being developed and tested at Lakehurst at full-scale shipboard representative test facilities here.\n\nThe former NAS Lakehurst also hosted the U.S. Navy's first helicopter squadrons, HU-1 (later HC-1) and HU-2 (later HC-2); the \"A\" and \"C\" enlisted training schools for the Aerographer's Mate (AG), Aviation Boatswain Mate (AB, ABE, ABF, ABH), and Parachute Rigger / Aircrew Survival Equipmentman (PR) ratings until their transfer to other Naval Air Technical Training Centers; and an Overhaul & Repair (O&R) facility for fixed-wing aircraft, the forerunner of the former Naval Air Rework Facilities and Naval Aviation Depots (NADEPs) now known as Fleet Readiness Centers (FRCs).\n\nToday the base is used for various Naval Aviation development programs. Lakehurst Maxfield's main airfield has two runways under its own control tower, while a separate test runway – equipped with a separate control tower and pavement-mounted catapults and arresting gear for testing aircraft-carrier suitability of new naval aircraft and new flight-deck systems – is located approximately a mile to the northwest.\n\nLakehurst is home to Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC) Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, which is the largest command on the field, followed by Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 64, operating the Navy Reserve Force's C-130T Hercules.\n\nIn addition, the field is host to a several CNATTU schools, the New Jersey Army National Guard's aviation unit, as well as other tenant organisations from Ocean County, the state of New Jersey, United States Air Force, New Jersey Air National Guard, United States Public Health Service and the United States Department of Justice.\n\nNaval Support Activity Lakehurst (NSA Lakehurst) is the United States Navy element representing USN and USMC entities for the Department of the Navy–specific asset and resources at Joint Base McGuire–Dix–Lakehurst (JB MDL), and administrative control over Naval personnel who are assigned to units that are assigned to the base.\n\nWhen the United States Department of Defense announced that Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst (NAES Lakehurst) would be affected by a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) action, merging it with two neighboring military bases, McGuire Air Force Base and Fort Dix, it established Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey, the nation's only tri-service installation. Each installation's major support services such as MWR, Legal, medical/dental-clinic, and exchange-services roles transitioned over to either Air Force or joint operation. However, both Lakehurst (and also Fort Dix, the third component of the installation) kept several service-specific support services for their personnel. With the disestablishment of NAES Lakehurst as a separate activity from JB MDL, NSA Lakehurst became the official sponsor for these activities.\n\nThe person who is the Commanding Officer, NSA Lakehurst is also the primary Deputy Commander of JB MDL, and reports to Commander, Naval Region Mid-Atlantic (CNRMA) for all administrative and logistical concerns, and to the Joint Base Commander for operational concerns.\n\n"}
{"id": "2156257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156257", "title": "Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth", "text": "Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth\n\nNathaniel Jarvis Wyeth (January 29, 1802 – August 31, 1856) was an American inventor and businessman in Boston, Massachusetts who contributed greatly to its ice industry. Due to his inventions, Boston could harvest and ship ice internationally. In the 1830s, he was also a mountain man who led two expeditions to the Northwest and set up two trading posts, one in present-day Idaho and one in present-day Oregon.\n\nIn the 1830s, he became interested in the Northwest and planned an expedition with Hall J. Kelley. In 1832 he proceeded independently, traveling to Fort Vancouver. Two years later in 1834, he led another expedition, founding Fort Hall in present-day Idaho and Fort William in present-day Portland, Oregon. Unable to succeed commercially against the powerful Hudson's Bay Company, he sold both fur trading posts to it in 1837. At the time, both Great Britain and the United States had fur trading companies, settlers and others in the Pacific Northwest. After they settled the northern boundary in 1846, both forts were considered part of the United States and its territories. After returning to Boston, Wyeth managed his business affairs and amassed a considerable fortune.\n\nThe Fort Hall site has been designated a National Historic Landmark and is considered the most important trading post in the Snake River Valley through the 1860s. More than 270,000 emigrants reached it while traveling the Oregon Trail.\n\nWyeth was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Jacob and Elizabeth (Jarvis) Wyeth. He married Elizabeth Jarvis Stone on January 29, 1824.\n\nHe began his working career in the 1820s by acting as foreman for a company that harvested ice from Fresh Pond in Cambridge, and thus helping Boston's \"Ice King\" Frederic Tudor to establish New England's ice trade with the Caribbean, Europe, and India. He invented a number of tools that revolutionized the ice-harvesting business and increased its productivity greatly. He also invented above-ground ice houses, with double walls for insulation. As the \"Dictionary of American Biography\" states, \"[I]t was said at his death that practically every implement and device used in the ice business had been invented by Nat Wyeth.\"\n\nWhen Wyeth was 30, Hall J. Kelley convinced him that the Oregon Country had excellent commercial prospects. Wyeth believed that he could become wealthy in the Oregon fur industry, develop farms for growing crops (especially tobacco), and start a salmon fishing and processing industry to rival New England's cod industry. When Kelley's plans for an expedition were long delayed, Wyeth formed one of his own, and as he wrote in his expedition journal: On 10 March 1832 I left Boston in a vessel with 20 men for Baltimore where I was joined by four more, and on the 27th left to Rail Road for Fredrick Md (Frederick, Maryland) from thence to Brownsville we marched on foot, and took passage from that place to Liberty Mo. on various steamboats, which place we left for the prairies on 12 May with 21 men, three having deserted, and on 27 May three more deserted.From there the expedition's route proceeded along what would later become known as the Oregon Trail along the Platte River valley, through the Black Hills, the Grand Tetons, north of the Great Salt Lake, thence to Fort Nez Percés where Pierre Pambrun gave him a new suit and arranged transportation down the Columbia River, finally arriving at Fort Vancouver on October 29. Several days later news was relayed to him that the ship charted to transport the necessary supplies for the venture, the \"Sultana\", had sunk. For his remaining employed men the news was demoralizing as the November 6 entry of Wyeth's journal notes, \"...my men came forward and unanimously desired to be released from their engagement with a view of returning home as soon as possible... I am now afloat on the great sea of life without stay or support but in good hands i.e. myself and providence\".\n\nAfter spending the winter months at Fort Vancouver, Wyeth departed overland with Francis Ermatinger who was headed to the Flathead Post. After reaching the trade station in February 1833 Ermatinger mentioned he had previously come to a Rendezvous with supplies to sell to the mountain men in return for furs. Wyeth took upon the idea and while at Fort Colvile sent letters to the Hudson's Bay Company Governor George Simpson along with John McLoughlin, the manager of the Columbia District, offering a business proposal. Wyeth offered to purchase supplies from Fort Vancouver then undersell American merchants rendezvous and resell the gained furs at a set price back at Vancouver. Additionally, he stated his intentions to avoid trapping around any HBC post, and limit trapping to south of the Columbia. Wyeth and his remaining men moved with the party of Benjamin Bonneville to the 1833 Rendezvous, held in the vicinity of modern Daniel, Wyoming on the Horse Creek. Before leaving the gathering, Wyeth negotiated with Milton Sublette and Thomas Fitzpatrick of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company to furnish $3,000 worth of supplies for the Rocky Mountain Fur Company at the next rendezvous. He reached Liberty, Missouri by late September, and then went on to Boston. Although the expedition had not been a commercial success, he brought with him a collection of plants previously unknown to botany.\n\nIn 1834 Wyeth outfitted a new expedition, with plans for establishing fur-trading posts, a salmon fishery, a colony, and other developments. Included in the company were two noted naturalists, Professor Thomas Nuttall (1786–1859) of Harvard University, and John Kirk Townsend, plus the missionary Jason Lee. Wyeth's party headed to the rendezvous held on the Hams Fork, near by what is now Granger, Wyoming, with 13,000 pounds of goods and reached there on the 19th of June. William Sublette had become aware of the contract between Wyeth and the Rocky Mountain Fur Company and forced the company to forfeit the contract. Continuing west with Thomas McKay, a stepson of McLoughlin, Wyeth quickly founded Fort Hall (July 1834) in southeastern Idaho. The Methodists were guided by McKay to Fort Nez Percés, but by the time Wyeth reached there he had left back east, leaving the missionaries with Pambrun. Unknown to Wyeth at that time was the construction of Fort Boise by McKay to undermine Fort Hall. Following the Columbia River Wyeth's second trading station Fort William was built on Wapato Island at present-day Portland, Oregon. Upon seeing the deserted Multnomah villages caused from recent disease epidemics, Wyeth noted that \"providence has made room for me and with doing them [Natives] more injury than I should if I had made room for myself viz Killing them off.\"\n\nWyeth reports in his journal that on September 15, 1834, he \nmet the Bg [Brig] May Dacre in full sail up the River boarded her and found all well she had put into Valparaíso having been struck by Lightning and much damaged. Capt Lambert was well and brot me 20 Sandwich Islanders and 2 Coopers 2 Smiths and a Clerk. \nDespite some success in its trapping, Wyeth and his company could not compete against the British Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), whose operations undercut his trading posts. Fort Vancouver remained the primary trading post on the Columbia, with Fort William generally ignored. Fort Hall, while later an important stop on the Oregon Trail, did not net much profits with Fort Boise undercutting his activities. In 1837, after selling Fort William and Fort Hall to the HBC, Wyeth returned to Boston in debt of $20,000 after five years of attempts at establishing a commercial outpost in the Oregon Country.\n\nThe second expedition was scientifically useful. Nuttall collected and identified 113 species of western plants, including sagebrush, \"Artemisia tridentata\" and \"mule's ear\", a sunflower genus, which he named \"Wyethia\" in Wyeth's honor.\n\nAlthough he failed in his two ventures in the Northwest, Wyeth returned to the ice-harvesting industry and established a sizable fortune. He continued to strongly support the occupation of Oregon by American settlers, and encouraged many to go west, although he did not cross the Mississippi again.\n\nNathaniel Jarvis Wyeth belongs genealogically to the Wyeth family of New England. He was the great-grandson of shoemaker Ebenezer Wyeth (1698–1754), who was the great-great-great-great-grandfather of the famous painter Andrew Wyeth (1917–2009). Nathaniel's father was Jacob Wyeth (1764–1847) and his grandfather was Ebenezer Wyeth, II (1727–1799).\n\n\n"}

Alongside Roberto Ivens, he is famous for being the first European to cross Central Africa from coast to coast between Angola and Mozambique.\n\nHermenegildo Capelo later rose to become aide-de-camp to King Luis I of Portugal and afterwards to King Carlos I and, later still, vice-admiral. His military career ended in 1910 when King Manuel II of Portugal was exiled.\n\nHermenegildo de Brito Capelo was born in Palmela, Portugal, a town about south of Lisbon. He was one of six brothers and his father was Major Félix António Gomes Capelo.\n\nIn 1860, Capelo sailed to Angola, in southwest Africa, and served on board the \"D Estefânia\" as a member of the Portuguese Navy, which was commanded by Prince Luís, staying for three years at a naval station before returning to Lisbon in 1863. He sailed to Africa again in 1866, visiting Angola, where he remained until 1869.\n\nBefore returning to Lisbon in 1876, his travels took him to Mozambique, Cape Verde, Guinea and Qing Dynasty China.\n\nIn 1875, Luciano Cordeiro, the founder of the Lisbon Geographic Society (\"Sociedade de Geografia de Lisboa\") created the Portuguese National Commission of Exploration and Civilization of Africa (\"\"), more commonly known as the Commission of Africa. Cordeiro's aims were to awaken public awareness of Portugal's African colonies and to raise funds by public subscription for the scientific-geographic expeditions necessary to define a single political Portuguese territory in Africa. These expeditions led to the recognition of the Kwango River and its relations with the Zaire River. They led also to the charting of the hydrographic basin of the Zambezi River, which helped to complete the map of southern Africa. By writing in defense of the Portuguese position in Africa, he helped to create a European expansionist movement, the \"Sociedade de Geografia de Lisboa\".\n\nThe political motivation of these expeditions anticipated the historic Berlin Conference which took place in 1885. Explorers of all European nations had launched themselves into rivalry for territorial gains, compelling Portugal to urgently review its own colonial position and the effectiveness of its presence in Africa. Portuguese ambitions to incorporate the area between Angola and Mozambique into a larger Portuguese territory led to Britain issuing the British Ultimatum to Portugal in 1890.\n\nHermenegildo Capelo was chosen on May 11, 1877, to direct a scientific expedition into Central Africa alongside the marine official Roberto Ivens and Serpa Pinto. Under the auspices of the \"Sociedade de Geografia de Lisboa\", this expedition aimed at \"...the study of the Kwango river and its relations with the Zaire [Congo River] and with the Portuguese territories of the west coast...\", as well as exploration of the region south and southeast of the source of the Zambezi river and the Kunene river.\n\nOn July 7, 1877, Hermenegildo Capelo, Roberto Ivens and Serpa Pinto set out, but later disagreed over the aims of the expedition. For Serpa Pinto it was to explore eastwards until they reached Mozambique. Capelo, however, saw it as an objective to reach Pretoria and possibly Durban in South Africa and the expedition divided. Capelo and Ivens explored the region of Bié and up to the lands of Iaca, having delimited the course of the Luando, Kubango and the Tohicapa rivers. On March 1, 1880, Lisbon received a triumphant communication from Hermenegildo Capelo and Roberto Ivens. The success of the expedition was recorded in the book \"De Benguela às Terras de Iaca\" (\"From Benguela to the Lands of Iaca\").\n\nFollowing a consolidation of gains in the region of the Bié Plateau and the Zambezi river and reaching the Victoria Falls, Hermenegildo Capelo and Roberto Ivens were stimulated and keen to embark upon a second, ambitious expedition.\n\nThe necessity of creating a general atlas of the Portuguese colonies led Pinheiro Chagas, at the time Overseas Minister, to create, on April 19, 1883, a Commission of Cartography. One of its intentions was to map a commercial route between Angola and Mozambique. This objective was decided upon on November 5 and the commission proceeded to make the necessary arrangements. The choice of two marine officials for this important mission was complicated by the uncertainty of what they would have to face, thus making age, as well as mapping skills and enthusiasm, an important factor in the choice. Hermenegildo Capelo and Roberto Ivens were chosen to carry through this new exploration of Africa.\n\nBetween 1884 and 1885, Capelo and Ivens explored between the coastline of Angola and the Huila plain and later through the interior of Quelimane in Mozambique. As they continued their hydrographic studies and observations of river flow and drainage patterns, but also taking notes on the ethnographic and the linguistic characters of the people they encountered, they established a long-sought-after route via land between the coasts of Angola and Mozambique, exploring the vast regions of the interior located between these two territories. Their achievements were recorded in a two-volume book titled: \"De Angola à Contra-Costa\" (\"From Angola to the Other Coast\").\n\nCapelo and Ivens began this expedition on January 6, 1884, and returned to Lisbon on September 20, 1886, where they were triumphantly received by King Luís I of Portugal.\n\nHermenegildo Capelo was made vice-president of the Overseas Institute, of which the first president was Queen Dona Amélia. His vision and his eminent skills at organization and direction were of great service to Portugal, alongside Roberto Ivens, Andrade Corvo, Luciano Cordeiro, Pinheiro Chagas, António Enes and Oliveira Martins. The Portuguese government recognized the value of these important contributions to Portuguese achievement.\n\nCapelo became aide-de-camp to King Luis I and King Carlos I of Portugal and chief of the military house of King Manuel II, Plenipotentiary Minister of Portugal with the Sultan of Zanzibar and created a geographical map of the province of Angola.\n\nCapelo was promoted to rear-admiral on May 17, 1902, and to vice-admiral on January 18, 1906. Dedicated to King Manuel II, Capelo accompanied His Majesty until he was exiled on October 5, 1910. On the 24th of the same month, Capelo was dismissed and his military career ended.\n\nIn Oporto, a street and a metro station are named after him. He also appeared on the 1000 Angolan escudo banknote issued in 1956.\n\n"}

Comprising all Latino members, the band paved the way for later Spanish-speaking punk bands in the United States and helped to increase the presence of Latinos in the country's predominantly white punk subculture. \n\nLos Crudos express a Left-wing political critique of issues affecting Latin America and the Latino community, such as U.S. imperialism, racism, xenophobia, and economic inequality. They have been described as \"one of '90s punk's truly great bands\" and \"one of the greatest hardcore bands...ever.\" Paul Kennedy additionally describes them as \"very popular in both the 'crusty' and Emo/straight edge scenes in North America.\"\n\nThe band formed in the early 1990s by singer Martin Sorrondeguy and guitarist José Casas, who remained the group's consistent members through changing rhythm sections. Their lyrics were almost always sung in Spanish; the song \"We're That Spic Band\" (written in response to an audience member calling them a \"spic band\") is the sole exception. Los Crudos' lyrics were explicitly political, addressing issues such as class, police brutality, homophobia, and California ballot propositions directed against immigrants. At concerts, Sorrondeguy would often speak at length about the songs' meanings between songs, partly as a way of getting around the language barrier (audiences weren't always happy about this). Their music was loud, fast, and energetic with songs built around three chords or fewer. \"We're That Spic Band\" and \"Asesinos\" (about \"the disappearances of radical youth during military dictatorships in Latin America\") have both been described as their most well-known songs.\n\nThe band's first shows were in Pilsen, the Latino neighborhood in Chicago where the band members lived, and many of their lyrics were first sung there. Sorrondeguy has said that, \"One of the main reasons for singing in Spanish was to communicate directly with kids in our neighborhood.\" In Pilsen, the band also worked closely with community agencies such as Project Vida, an AIDS prevention organization, and Project Hablo, a domestic violence support group. \n\nLos Crudos incorporated DIY ethics into every aspect of the band's existence, including promoting and booking shows, recording music, touring, and silk-screening T-shirts. They toured Mexico (in 1994), South America, Europe, and Japan, as well as touring the US many times. The band's recordings were released on independent record labels such as Flat Earth Records, Ebullition Records, and Sorrondeguy's label Lengua Armada Discos. The group's final rhythm section included bassist Juan Jimenez and drummer Ebro Virumbrales (also a member of Charles Bronson and MK-ULTRA).\n\nLos Crudos played its last shows in October 1998,in the neighborhood which they started in, Pilsen. After the band's breakup, Sorrondeguy became the vocalist for Limp Wrist, as well as releasing a documentary about Chicano and Latino punk (\"\"). He has also been in the bands Harto and Tragatelo. Guitarist Jose now plays in the Chicago punk band I Attack. Drummer Ebro became the vocalist for Chicago band Punch in the Face.\n\nThe band played an unannounced reunion show in June 2006 at Southkore (America's first and largest Latino punk festival), in Chicago's Little Village. The festival attracted more than 400 fans. They also played reunion shows in 2008's Chaos in Tejas festival in Austin, Texas and in Los Angeles, California in 2008. In 2016, Crudos played shows in the Midwest and readied for a tour of the U.K. and numerous Scandinavian cities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A former striker, he was the all-time top scorer in the Norwegian top division with 166 goals in 255 matches, before being surpassed by Sigurd Rushfeldt in 2011.\n\nHe has played for Kolstad, Rosenborg BK, Celtic, F.C. Copenhagen and Bodø/Glimt (loan).\n\nBrattbakk is most known for his goalscoring abilities for the Norwegian club Rosenborg BK where he has enjoyed three spells (1990–91, 1994–97 and 2001–06) scoring most of his goals which has helped him reach the top of the all-time goalscoring chart in the Norwegian Premier League.\n\nAt Celtic, where he played from December 1997 to January 2000, Brattbakk seemed overawed by the pressures of playing for one of Scotland's Old Firm clubs. Though he did enjoy some success with the club — including hitting the clinching goal against St Johnstone to help them win the SPL title on the final day of the 1997–1998 season, and scoring all four goals in a 4–0 win over Kilmarnock that same year — his spell in Glasgow was generally characterised by nervous performances and insufficient goals.\n\nHowever, Brattbakk has been very successful in Norway. With 166 goals he was the highest-scoring player in the history of the Norwegian Premier League, until his record was beat by Sigurd Rushfeldt on 29 May 2011. Moreover, his record in the Champions League is an impressive one, and includes goals against such top sides as Real Madrid and Milan. He scored 28 goals in 66 matches for Rosenborg BK and scored 4 goals in 9 matches for Celtic in various European Cups. In November 2001, he scored twice against his old club Celtic as Rosenborg defeated them 2–0 in a Champions League tie in Trondheim.\n\nBrattbakk returned to Rosenborg after being on a loan to Bodø/Glimt in the last half of the 2005 season, but on 20 February 2006 it was announced that he had been relieved from his contract and he has now retired from the game.\n\nIn 2008 Brattbakk made a comeback in football after signing a contract with his native Kolstad-Fotball, an amateur club in the Norwegian 3rd Division Dep. 19. However, the comeback lasted only for the rest of the 2008 season.\n\nBrattbakk made his debut for Norway in a February 1995 friendly match against Estonia in which he scored two goals. He went on to play seventeen times for his country, scoring five goals.\n\nOn 21 November 2006 Brattbakk announced on the Norwegian television channel TV3 that he intended to become an airline pilot after his retirement from professional football. He trained as a pilot in Florida at Phoenix East Aviation, Inc. and got his commercial aircraft certification in 2008. Until 2010 he flew for the aircraft company Helitrans, based at Trondheim Airport, Værnes. This included missions for Norwegian Coast Guard.

{"id": "2156280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156280", "title": "Baptism of Jesus", "text": "Baptism of Jesus\n\nThe baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist is a major event in the life of Jesus is described in three of the gospels: Matthew, Mark and Luke. It is considered to have taken place at Al-Maghtas, located in Jordan.\n\nMost modern theologians view the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist as a historical event to which a high degree of certainty can be assigned. Along with the crucifixion of Jesus, most biblical scholars view it as one of the two historically certain facts about him, and often use it as the starting point for the study of the historical Jesus.\n\nThe baptism is one of the events in the narrative of the life of Jesus in the canonical Gospels; others include the Transfiguration, Crucifixion, Resurrection, and Ascension. Most Christian denominations view the baptism of Jesus as an important event and a basis for the Christian rite of baptism (see also ). In Eastern Christianity, Jesus' baptism is commemorated on 6 January (the Julian calendar date of which corresponds to 19 January on the Gregorian calendar), the feast of Epiphany. In the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, the Lutheran Churches and some other Western denominations, it is recalled on a day within the following week, the feast of the baptism of the Lord. In Roman Catholicism, the baptism of Jesus is one of the Luminous Mysteries sometimes added to the Rosary. It is a Trinitarian feast in the Eastern Orthodox Churches.\n\nMark, Matthew, and Luke depict the baptism in parallel passages. In all three gospels, the Holy Spirit is depicted as descending upon Jesus immediately after his baptism accompanied by a voice from Heaven, but the accounts of Luke and Mark record the voice as addressing Jesus by saying \"You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased\", while in Matthew the voice addresses the crowd \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased\" ().\n\nAfter the baptism, the Synoptic gospels describe the temptation of Jesus, where Jesus withdrew to the Judean desert to fast for forty days and nights.\n\nIn , upon meeting Jesus, John said: \"I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?\" However, Jesus convinces John to baptize him nonetheless. Matthew uniquely records that the voice from heaven addresses the crowd, rather than addressing Jesus himself as in Mark and Luke.\n\nMark's account is roughly parallel to that of Matthew, except for – describing John's initial reluctance and eventual consent to baptize Jesus, which is not described by Mark. Mark uses an unusual word for the opening of the heavens, Greek: σχίζω, \"schizō\", which means “tearing” or “ripping” (Mark 1:10). It forms a verbal thread (Leitwortstil) with the rending of the Temple veil in Mark 15:38, inviting comparison between the two episodes.\n\nLuke 1 begins with the birth of John the Baptist, heralded to his father Zacharias by the angel Gabriel. Six months later Gabriel appears to the Virgin Mary with an announcement of the birth of Jesus, at the Annunciation. At the same, Gabriel also announces to Mary the coming birth of John the Baptist, to her kinswoman Elizabeth, who is the wife of Zacharias. Mary immediately sets out to visit her kinswoman Elizabeth, and stays with her until John's birth. Luke strongly contrasts the reactions of Zacharias and Mary to these two respective births; and the lives of John and Jesus are intertwined.\n\nLuke uniquely depicts John as showing public kindness to tax collectors and encouraging the giving of alms to the poor (as in ). Luke records that Jesus was praying when Heaven was opened and the Holy Spirit descended on him. Luke clarifies that the spirit descended in the \"bodily form\" of a dove, as opposed to merely \"descending like\" a dove. In , the ministry of Jesus is described as following \"the baptism which John preached\".\n\nIn rather than a direct narrative, John the Baptist bears witness to the spirit descending like a dove.\n\nThe Gospel of John () specifies \"Bethabara beyond Jordan\", i.e., Bethany in Perea as the location where John was baptizing when Jesus began choosing disciples, and in there is mention of further baptisms in Ænon \"because there was much water there\".\n\nThe episode in forms the start of the relationship between Jesus and his future disciples. When John the Baptist called Jesus the Lamb of God, the \"two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus\". One of the disciples is named Andrew, but the other remains unnamed, and Raymond E. Brown raises the question of his being the author of the Gospel of John himself. In the Gospel of John, the disciples follow Jesus thereafter, and bring other disciples to him, and portrays the disciples of John as eventually merging with the followers of Jesus.\n\nAccording to the non-canonical Gospel of the Nazarenes, the idea of being baptized by John came from the mother and brothers of Jesus, and Jesus himself, originally opposed, reluctantly accepted it. Benjamin Urrutia avers that this version is supported by the criterion of embarrassment, since followers of Jesus would not have invented an episode in which Jesus changes his mind and comes to accept someone else's plan. Plus, the story came from the community that included the family of Jesus, who would have guaranteed the authenticity of the narrative.\n\nThe Gospel of John () refers to Enon near Salim as one place where John the Baptist baptized people, \"because there was much water there\". Separately, states that John the Baptist was baptizing in \"Bethany beyond the Jordan\". This is not the village Bethany just east of Jerusalem, but is generally considered to be the town Bethany, also called Bethabara in Perea on the Eastern bank of the Jordan near Jericho. In the 3rd century Origen, who moved to the area from Alexandria, suggested Bethabara as the location. In the 4th century, Eusebius of Caesarea stated that the location was on the west bank of the Jordan, and following him, the early Byzantine Madaba Map shows Bethabara as (Βέθαβαρά).\n\nThe biblical baptising is related to springs and a Wadi (al-Kharrar) close to the Eastern site of the Jordan River, not the Jordan itself. The pilgrimage sites, important for both Christians and Jews have shifted place during history. The site of Al-Maghtas (\"baptism\", or \"immersion\" in Arabic) on the East side of the River in Jordan has been deemed the earliest place of worship. This site was found following UNESCO-sponsored excavations. Al-Maghtas was visited by Pope John Paul II in March 2000, and he said: \"In my mind I see Jesus coming to the waters of the river Jordan not far from here to be baptized by John the Baptist\". The Muslim conquest put an end to the Byzantine buildings on the east bank of the Jordan River, the later reverence took place just across the river in the West Bank at Qasr el Yahud.\n\nThe baptism of Jesus is generally considered as the start of his ministry, shortly after the start of the ministry of John the Baptist. states that:\nIn the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar—when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea ... , the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness.\n\nThere are two approaches to determining when the reign of Tiberius Caesar started. The traditional approach is that of assuming that the reign of Tiberius started when he became co-regent in 11 AD, placing the start of the ministry of John the Baptist around 26 AD. However, some scholars assume it to be upon the death of his predecessor Augustus Caesar in 14 AD, implying that the ministry of John the Baptist began in 29 AD.\n\nThe generally assumed dates for the start of the ministry of John the Baptist based on this reference in the Gospel of Luke are about 28–29 AD, with the ministry of Jesus with his baptism following it shortly thereafter.\n\nMost modern scholars believe that John the Baptist performed a baptism on Jesus, and view it as a historical event to which a high degree of certainty can be assigned. James Dunn states that the historicity of the baptism and crucifixion of Jesus \"command almost universal assent\". Dunn states that these two facts \"rank so high on the 'almost impossible to doubt or deny' scale of historical facts\" that they are often the starting points for the study of the historical Jesus. John Dominic Crossan states that it is historically certain that Jesus was baptised by John in the Jordan.\n\nIn the \"Antiquities of the Jews\" (18.5.2) 1st-century historian Flavius Josephus also wrote about John the Baptist and his eventual death in Perea.\n\nThe existence of John the Baptist within the same time frame as Jesus, and his eventual execution by Herod Antipas is attested to by 1st-century historian Flavius Josephus and the overwhelming majority of modern scholars view Josephus' accounts of the activities of John the Baptist as authentic. Josephus establishes a key connection between the historical events he recorded and specific episodes that appear in the gospels. The reference in the \"Antiquities of the Jews\" by Josephus to John's popularity among the crowds () and how he preached his baptism is considered a reliable historical datum. Unlike the gospels, Josephus does not relate John and Jesus, and does not state that John's baptisms were for the remission of sins. However, almost all modern scholars consider the Josephus passage on John to be authentic in its entirety and view the variations between Josephus and the gospels as indications that the Josephus passages are authentic, for a Christian interpolator would have made them correspond to the Christian traditions.\n\nOne of the arguments in favour of the historicity of the baptism of Jesus by John is that it is a story which the early Christian Church would have never wanted to invent, typically referred to as the criterion of embarrassment in historical analysis. Based on this criterion, given that John baptised for the remission of sins, and Jesus was viewed as without sin, the invention of this story would have served no purpose, and would have been an embarrassment given that it positioned John above Jesus. The Gospel of Matthew attempts to offset this problem by having John feel unworthy to baptise Jesus and Jesus giving him permission to do so in .\n\nThe gospels are not the only references to the baptisms performed by John and in , the apostle Peter refers to how the ministry of Jesus followed \"the baptism which John preached\". Another argument used in favour of the historicity of the baptism is that multiple accounts refer to it, usually called the criterion of multiple attestation. Technically, multiple attestation does not guarantee authenticity, but only determines antiquity. However, for most scholars, together with the criterion of embarrassment it lends credibility to the baptism of Jesus by John being a historical event.\n\nWhile the gospel of Luke is explicit about the \"Spirit of God\" descending in the shape of a dove, the wording of Matthew is vague enough that it could be interpreted only to suggest that the descent was in the style of a dove. Although a variety of symbolisms were attached to doves at the time these passages were written, the dove imagery has become a well known symbol for the Holy Spirit in Christian art. Depictions of the baptismal scene typically show the sky opening and the Holy Spirit descending as a dove towards Jesus.\n\nThe reformer Martin Luther wrote a hymn about baptism, based on biblical accounts about the baptism of Jesus, \"Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam\" (1541). It is the basis for a cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach, , first performed on 24 June 1724.\n\n"}

Having attracted the notice of Gottskálk Nikulásson bishop of Hólar, he was sent on two missions to Norway. In 1522, he succeeded Gottskálk in the episcopal see of Hólar, but he was soon driven out by the other Icelandic bishop, Ögmundur of Skálholt. Bishop Ögmundur later opposed the imposition of Lutheranism to Iceland, but being old and blind by that time his opposition proved effectively meaningless.\n\nBy this point Jón Arason had become known for his great talents if somewhat erratic faith. He fathered numerous children who fought for his causes figuratively and later literally. This was despite the canonical obligation that Catholic bishops are to be celibate, but Iceland was distant enough from Rome for clerical discipline in that age to be very lax.\n\nBishop Jón became involved in a dispute with his sovereign, King Christian III, because of the bishop's refusal to promote Lutheranism on the island. Although initially he took a defensive rather than an offensive position on the matter, this changed radically in 1548. At that point he and Bishop Ögmundur joined their forces to attack the Lutherans. Bishop Ögmundur's contribution did not last, however, because of his infirmities, and he quickly faced exile to Denmark.\n\nJón's continued resistance is thought to have come from a kind of primitive nationalism and simple ambition as much as religion. He resented the Danes' changing the religious landscape of Iceland and felt their culture would be less disrupted by staying Catholic. Hence he took encouragement from a letter of support from Pope Paul III in continuing his efforts against the Lutheran cause. Jón knew no bounds in his zeal toward that cause, as he fought for what he deemed to be a Catholic Iceland, in a personal struggle against the Danes. In this struggle he had the help of his illegitimate children, who fought with him in various battles. However his attempt to capture his greatest adversary, Daði Guðmundsson at the Battle of Sauðafell led to him being taken prisoner and handed over to the king's bailiff. Legend states that, on hearing this, one of his daughters rallied her forces to save him, but even if this is so her efforts proved unsuccessful. In 1550, Jón and two of his sons, Ari and Björn, were captured and beheaded. Christian Skriver, the king's bailiff who had pronounced the bishop's death sentence, was later killed by fishermen who favored Jón's cause; they were persuaded to assassinate him by Þjórunn Jónsdóttir, a wealthy female chieftain and the illegitimate daughter of Jón, and by Helga Sigurðardóttir, Jón's mistress of many years, . Skriver's death was thus every bit as much very personal revenge for Jón's death as it was born of any sectarian strife between Catholics and Lutherans.\n\nLegends claim that as he was about to be beheaded, a priest called Sveinn was by his side to offer him comfort. Sveinn told Jón: \"Líf er eftir þetta, herra!\" (\"There is a life after this one, Sire!\") Jón turned to Sveinn and said: \"Veit ég það, Sveinki!\" (\"That I know, little Sveinn!\") Ever since \"veit ég það, Sveinki\" has been a part of the Icelandic treasury of sayings, in this case meaning that something totally obvious has been stated.\n\nGunnar Gunnarsson wrote \"Jón Arason\" (Copenhagen: Gyldendal, 1930), a fictionalized account of the life of Jón.

The north slope of the mountain borders the Winooski River, which has carved through the Green Mountains over eons. At , it is tied (with Mount Ellen) for the third-highest mountain in Vermont. Surrounded by of alpine tundra, the mountain is the most significant feature in Camel's Hump State Park. Because of its distinctive profile, it is perhaps the state's most recognized mountain, featured on the state quarter.\n\nSince Europeans first saw the mountain, probably on Samuel de Champlain's 1609 trip down Lake Champlain to the west, the mountain has had a number of names related to its distinctive shape. De Champlain named the mountain \"Le Lion Couchant\", a heraldic image which roughly translates as \"The Resting Lion\". Ira Allen later referred to the mountain as \"Camel's Rump\" on a map from 1798. It was not until 1830 that the name \"Camel's Hump\" came into usage.\nThe Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) lists twelve variant names including \"Tah-wak-be-dee-ee-so wadso\" and Catamountain. While place names are determined by local usage the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN) serves as a central authority in the United States concerning place names. Since its inception in 1890 the BGN has discouraged the use of the genitive apostrophe. Local usage is often at odds with this policy and so the name of this mountain is alternatively spelled with and without an apostrophe.\n\nCamel's Hump is more notable for its shape than its height. Isolated from neighboring peaks by the Winooski Valley and glacial action, the mountain's conical silhouette is distinctive, if misleading. It has two \"humps\", with the southernmost being the higher, and a steep drop to the south as a result of a quarrying action of the ice passing over it. The movement of glacial ice shaped it into what is referred to as a roche moutonnée. The bedrock consists of phyllite, quartzite and schist.\n\nIn 1968 the National Park Service designated Camel's Hump a National Natural Landmark, citing the peak as \"an exceptional illustration of the complex anticlinal deformation which formed the Green Mountains\". The landmark area consists of approximately from the summit down to .\n\nThe summit of Camel's Hump is home to of alpine tundra vegetation. Common plants found in this area include: Bigelow's sedge (\"Carex bigelowii\"), alpine bilberry (\"Vaccinium uliginosum\"), mountain sandwort (\"Minuartia groenlandica\"), crowberry (\"Empetrum nigrum\"), mountain cranberry (\"Vaccinium vitis-idaea\"), and Labrador tea (\"Rhododendron groenlandicum\"). A direct result of glacial formation, these alpine species were once widespread but as the lower elevations warmed, only the very peak of Camel's Hump remained hospitable to the fragile plants.\n\nThere are 18 species of plants at or near the summit of Camel's Hump that are thought to be rare or very rare. Of these, five species are protected by the Vermont endangered and threatened species rule: Boott's rattlesnake-root (\"Nabalus boottii\", generically known as white lettuce), bearberry willow (\"Salix uva-ursi\"), lesser wintergreen (\"Pyrola minor\"), alpine sweetgrass (\"Anthoxanthum monticola\"), and squashberry (\"Viburnum edule\"). The Green Mountain Club's Summit Caretaker program actively promotes Leave No Trace principles and helps to protect the alpine tundra natural community on the summit of Camel's Hump.\n\nDespite extensive logging during the late 1800s and a great fire in 1903, Camel's Hump continues to support a significant population of red spruce (\"Picea rubens\"). Starting in the 1960s, Hub Vogelmann and his graduate students from the University of Vermont observed an extensive decline in the red spruce population on the west slope of Camel's Hump. Vogelmann's 1982 landmark paper “Catastrophe on Camel’s Hump” identified the cause of the decline to be acid rain. Similarly the Forest Decline Project at the University of Vermont published a study in 1991 that again cited acid rain as the culprit.\nThese findings raised public awareness and eventually led to a revision of the Clean Air Act. By 2017, with mounting evidence that the health of red spruce was on the rise, the scourge of acid rain in the northeast had largely come to an end.\n\nThe Abnaki name for the mountain was \"ta wak be dee esso wadso,\" or \"tahwahbodeay wadso\" (wadso meaning mountain), which has been variously translated as \"resting place\", \"sit-down place\", and \"prudently, we make a campfire in a circle near water (and rest) at this mountain.\"\n\nIn 1905, publisher and philanthropist Joseph Battell donated of virgin forest, including the summit of Camel's Hump, to the State of Vermont.\nThe bequest was intended to form a state park to be kept in a \"primitive state\" and in 1911 the state forester was given charge of the area who managed the land in accordance with Battell's wishes. Since then, Vermont has adopted new legislation to preserve its natural areas and in 1969 created a Forest Reserve enclosing the mountain. Camel's Hump State Park has grown since the original bequest and in 1991 totalled approximately .\n\nIn October 1944, during World War II, a B-24J bomber on a training mission crashed into the side of the mountain near the summit. While most of the plane was salvaged and removed, portions of the wreckage (principally a wing section) still remain. The Alpine Trail passes by the site.\n\nThough protected, the Camel's Hump area is a favorite recreational venue for hikers. Trail work began on Camel's Hump at the formation of the Green Mountain Club (GMC) and by 1912, a trail had been constructed between the mountain and Sterling Pond.\nThis initial trail would later become a high point in the \"footpath in the wilderness\" known as the Long Trail. In the 1950s, the GMC constructed shelters along the trail and at the summit. The GMC now trains and pays a caretaker to reside near the summit during the summer and educate hikers to respect the fragile alpine ecosystem that exists on the mountain.\n\nIn 1999, an image of Camel's Hump was chosen as a prominent feature for the Vermont state quarter. While many other options were considered, including covered bridges and the snowflake photographs of Wilson Bentley, the seven-person panel ultimately decided on Camel's Hump stating that it was \"perfect for the quarter.\" The panels findings explained the choice: \"It's wild and natural, like the Vermont countryside. It's unique and asymmetrical, like the independent and quirky reputation Vermonters have.\"\nMany notable Vermont institutions have adopted its memorable name, including the children's radio show \"Camel's Hump Radio\" hosted by Bill Harley on Vermont Public Radio.\nThe profile of Camel's Hump appears in the Vermont coat of arms on the Vermont flag.\n\n\"With the only undeveloped alpine area in the Green Mountain State and a skyline that sets it apart from everything else, Camel's Hump may be Vermont's finest peak,\" says Michael Lanza in his guidebook for New England hiking enthusiasts. The views from the summit are panoramic, and on a clear day one can see the highest peaks of the following states: Mount Marcy in New York, Mount Washington in New Hampshire, as well as Vermont's Mount Mansfield.\n\nThe most popular access points for hikers are the Burrows Trailhead east of Huntington and the Monroe Trailhead south of Duxbury. In 2016, almost 26,000 visitors signed the trail registers at these two trailheads. Parking is also available along Duxbury Road west of Duxbury, but this parking area is much further from Camel's Hump.\n\nThere are multiple trails in the vicinity of Camel's Hump. The Long Trail traverses the summit of Camel's Hump on a north–south path. The Burrows Trail (from the west) and the Monroe Trail (from the east) intersect the Long Trail at the Hut Clearing just north of the Camel's Hump summit.\n\nThe Burrows Trailhead () is at the end of Camel's Hump Road east of Huntington.

Average temperatures in January are , and in July. Rainfall averages annually.\n\nThe 80.4% of Bauska Municipality territory is agricultural land and 13% of forests. \n\nIn previous centuries city was known in German as \"Bauske\", in Yiddish as \"Boisk\" and in Lithuanian as \"Bauskė\".\n\nin 2019 population of the town Bauska was 24 370 people with an approximate density of 30 people per km \n\nBy the early 13th century this territory was inhabited by Semigallian tribes. In the mid-15th century, Bauska castle was built by Germans of the Livonian Order, who then were a part of the \"Terra Mariana\" confederacy. In the shadow and protection of the castle a small town called Schildburg grew on the narrow peninsula formed by the Mūsa and Mēmele rivers. Around 1580 on the orders of Duke Gotthard Kettler this settlement was relocated to the present location of Bauska Old Town, eventually receiving city rights sometime before 1609.\n\nAfter the Livonian War Bauska became part of the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia and prospered. The castle and city suffered heavily in the 17th and 18th centuries, under attacks from Sweden in the Polish-Swedish War and the Russians in the Great Northern War. In 1706. retreating Russians blow up the castle. In 1711 an outbreak of plague ravaged Bauska, exterminating half of the population, and war returned once more in 1812, when Bauska, after short skirmishes, became one of Napoleon's army's transit points en route to Moscow.\n\nBetween 1812 and 1914, Bauska enjoyed a period of stability, and grew as a trade center between Riga and Lithuania. Many inhabitants were merchants or worked in ceramic-making, but there was a large brewery and sawmill as well. Bauska was still primarily built of wooden houses: in 1823, only 6 of the 120 houses within the city were built of brick or stone. For this reason, devastating fires were not uncommon.\n\nHistorically, all social affairs had been in the hands of the privileged Baltic Germans. After 1820 Jews were allowed to settle in the city, and by 1850 made up half the population, diluting the strong German influence.\n\nThe city was taken by the German Imperial Army on July 18, 1915, and roughly half the population fled (Jews were moved out on the orders of the Russian army). In 1916, the Germans installed the city's first electrical grid and built a narrow-gauge railway connection with Jelgava–Meitene Railway.\n\nDuring the Latvian War of Independence Bauska experienced a couple of months of Red Army occupation, followed by the periods of rule by the Baltische Landeswehr and West Russian Volunteer Army until it was liberated in the early hours of November 17, 1919 by the Latvian army.\n\nFrom 1918 to 1940, the proportion of ethnic Latvians in the population grew strongly, making up 75% of the population, though the Jews and Germans still maintained a noticeable presence. In 1939, just before World War II, virtually the entire Baltic German population of Bauska repatriated to the recently occupied Reichsgau Wartheland, causing the city to lose one of its traditional ethnic populations. As part of the Holocaust during the June–August 1941, Bauska's other traditional minority, the Jews were exterminated.\n\nDuring the Operation Bagration Soviet army reached Bauska on July 29, 1944. For the next six weeks city was defended by assortment of Latvian policemen, forcibly mobilized Latvian Legion soldiers and Wehrmacht grenadiers. After Soviet shelling and air raids almost one third of the city was destroyed and finally captured on September 14, 1944.\n\nPost-war reconstruction was slow. Rubble remained in the streets until the 1950s. During the Soviet period, the population surpassed 10,000, as the Latvian and especially Russian populations strongly increased.\n\nBauska was home to a thriving Jewish community in the 19th century, many employed as scholars or in occupations such as baking and distilling. The town hosted several notable rabbis, including Abraham Isaac Kook, later chief rabbi of Israel, , and Chaim Yitzchak Bloch Hacohen.\n\nIn 1850, Jews made up 50% of Bauska's population, and 60% in 1881. By 1920, the Jewish population had dwindled to about a sixth of the size it had been 40 years earlier. In 1941, following the Nazi invasion, the remaining Jews of Bauska and environs were tortured and executed.\n\nAn exhibition on the city's Jewish history was opened in 2011 in Bauska museum following a conference on Bauska's Jewish cultural heritage in the 1990s. A group of Jews who were former inhabitants of Bauska proposed to establish a memorial on the site of the synagogue that was burnt down in July 1941 but so far have been refused by the City council.\n\nIn December 2004, there were 10,178 inhabitants, 55% female and 45% male.\n\n\nOn September 14, 2012, a monument to the inhabitants of city who organized the defense of Bauska against the Soviet assault in 1944 was unveiled in the city, with inscription \"To the defenders of Bauska against the second Soviet occupation on July 28 – September 14, 1944\". This event was represented by Russian language media as glorification of Nazism in Latvia.\n\nBauska is twinned with:\n\n"}

It moved to a middle of the road format in 1982.\n\nSequel Communications bought KLIZ and its FM sister station, KLIZ-FM (107.5), in 1985.

It airs a sports radio format branded as \"Northland Fan.\"\n\nThe AM station feeds an FM translator W293CT at 106.5 MHz. While the FM station is limited in its coverage area, the AM station can be heard through much of Northeastern Minnesota and Northwestern Wisconsin. It is powered at 5,000 watts around the clock. The studios and offices are shared with its three other sister stations at 14 East Central Entrance, in the Duluth Heights area of Duluth, MN.\n\nWEBC is the oldest radio station in the Duluth-Superior market. Founded by Leslie Ross, who owned Ross Electric Shop in Superior, WI. Ross ran WEBC as a hobby and it was funded on a \"shoe-string budget\" by proceeds from Ross Electric Shop. WEBC was broadcast from a small top-floor room of the three-story Evening Telegram newspaper building. Atop the building were two towers, one on each end of the building\nwith the transmitting antenna hung between them, as was the manner of broadcast stations of the day.\n\nRoss's tower engineer was Walter C. Bridges, who helped WEBC sign on June 1, 1924, using 50 watts of power on AM 1240. For its first year, WEBC was operated out of Bridges's home in the upstairs of the Evening Telegraph building. Duluth studios were established in 1926 on the second floor of the Spalding Hotel and the community of license was later changed to Duluth, though WEBC's transmitter has always remained on the Wisconsin side of the bridge.\n\nThe station was temporarily raised to 500 watts in 1928 in order to provide radio service to President Calvin Coolidge who was vacationing nearby. Charles B. Persons, whom Leslie Ross hired at the age of 17 in 1926, proceeded to produce and broadcast content that included details of president Coolidge's activities, such as fishing on the Brule River in Wisconsin during his 3-month vacation as well as Mr. & Mrs. Coolidge touring the streets of picturesque Duluth by chauffeured motorcar to greet devoted supporters. The New York Times nicknamed WEBC \"The President's Station\" as WEBC joined NBC at this time, in order to provide the vacationing president with coverage of the national political conventions. Charlie Persons continued to work for WEBC for 28 years, covering local and national news, sports, Presidential administrations and wars.\n\nWEBC's owners founded WMFG in Hibbing, Minnesota in 1935 and WHLB in Virginia, Minnesota in 1936. The three stations were linked for local programming as part of the Arrowhead Radio Network. WEBC's influence in regional programming was strengthened in 1942 when WMFG and WHLB switched to NBC from CBS.\n\nWEBC and its NBC programming dominated the market in the 1930s and 1940s. Like most other stations in the \"Golden Age of Radio\", WEBC carried a general entertainment format as the local affiliate of the NBC Radio Network. The station ended up on 560 in the mid-1950s after a series of upgrades and frequency changes. In 1955, with radio losing listeners to TV, WEBC dropped NBC and adopted a hot new format: Top 40. WEBC featured announcers such as Lance \"Tac\" Hammer, Lew Latto, and \"Doctor\" Don Rose, among many others.\n\nW. C. Bridges was an early adopter of frequency modulation, and created a sister station in 1940, WEBC-FM. Ultimately the station was not a financial success, and it went off the air in 1950. Although Bridges and Head of the Lakes Broadcasting Company applied to construct a television station in June, 1949, this never came to pass. Instead, WDSM and KDAL were able to finally overcome their longtime rival by going into television first in 1953. WDSM-TV (now KBJR-TV) became an NBC-TV affiliate, which contributed to WEBC's 1955 switch to Top 40 programming.\n\nWEBC's first ownership change came in 1958, when W. C. Bridges, as general manager of Head of the Lakes Broadcasting Company, sold the station to George Clinton of Clarkesburg, West Virginia for $250,000.

WEBC briefly switched to Country music and then became a forerunner to the Classic hits format. Talk programming was added to the lineup by the late-1980s and took over the entire schedule by 1990. The format was then changed to All-Sports in 2003 after a sale to Clear Channel Communications, which syndicated the \"FAN\" radio network from KFAN in Minneapolis to a number of its stations in the region. After the station was sold to GapWest Broadcasting in 2007, WEBC joined ESPN Radio (with \"FAN\" programming soon moving to rival KQDS). GapWest was folded into Townsquare Media on August 13, 2010.\n\nAt 6 p.m. on September 30, 2015 WEBC dropped its sports format and began stunting with Christmas music, branded as \"Ho Ho 106.5\" (now simulcasting on FM translator W293CT 106.5 FM Duluth). At 1p.m. on October 6, WEBC flipped to classic rock as \"Sasquatch 106.5\" after a 23-hour marathon of the 1975 song \"Bigfoot\" by Bro Smith.\n\nOn January 30, 2020 Townsquare Media announced that it would acquire WWAX with Townsquare assuming control of WWAX via local marketing agreement on February 1, at which point the classic rock format of WEBC began simulcasting on WWAX as \"Sasquatch 92.1\". After a temporary simulcast, the sports talk format on WWAX will then move to WEBC as \"Fan 106.5\" on February 17. \n\n"}

The station is owned by Sarkes Tarzian, Inc. WRCB's studios are located on Whitehall Road on Chattanooga's north side; its transmitter is located in the town of Walden on Signal Mountain. On cable, the station is available on Comcast Xfinity channels 4 and 432, and on EPB Fiber Optics channels 3 and 303 in the Chattanooga area. Although parts of the Chattanooga market are in the Central Time Zone, all schedules are listed in Eastern Time.\n\nThe station began broadcasting on May 6, 1956 on analog Channel 3 as WRGP-TV. The call letters came from its founder, Ramon G. Patterson. It picked up the NBC affiliation from WROM-TV in Rome, Georgia (now WTVC, located today in Chattanooga proper). Its studios were first located at 1214 McCallie Avenue, between downtown and Missionary Ridge.\n\nThe station has belonged to several owners over the years. In 1959, Friendly Broadcasting, owner of WSTV-TV in Steubenville, Ohio (now WTOV-TV) bought WRGP from Patterson's group. In 1961, WSTV and WRGP were sold to the Massachusetts-based United Printers and Publishers, who later became Rust Craft Broadcasting, named after its greeting card line, which has since been acquired by American Greetings. These owners changed the station's call letters to WRCB-TV in 1963, to reflect the initials of the licensee. In 1968 the station moved to new facilities on Whitehall Road, on Chattanooga's north side, across the Tennessee River from downtown. Those new studios and equipment enabled channel 3 to begin broadcasting in color. In 1979, Rust Craft merged with magazine publisher Ziff Davis, who, in turn, sold WRCB to current owner Sarkes Tarzian, Inc. of Bloomington, Indiana, in 1982.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nOn November 1, 2008, WRCB added Retro Television Network (RTV) on its second digital subchannel; the station had previously aired NBC Weather Plus on the subchannel, but that network was shut down by the end of the year. On January 1, 2012, WRCB replaced RTV with Antenna TV.\n\nWRCB shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 3, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 13. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 3.\n\nAs part of the SAFER Act, WRCB kept its analog signal on the air until July 12 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.\n\nSyndicated programming on WRCB includes \"Entertainment Tonight\", \"Inside Edition\" (which is hosted by North Georgia native Deborah Norville), \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\", and \"Rachael Ray\".\n\nWRCB produces 5½ hours of news each weekday, and six hours of news on weekends. The station is known for its \"School Patrol\" and \"Crimestoppers\" reports, which have been popular features on its newscasts for more than twenty years. On September 28, 2012, WRCB made the on-air transition from standard definition (4:3) to high definition (16:9).\n\n"}

Classed as a rural seat, the electorate is located in the centre of the state, north of the capital city of Melbourne. It includes the outer northern suburbs of Craigieburn, Doreen, Mernda, Sunbury and Wollert, and extends along the Hume Freeway north of the metropolitan area to include the towns of Gisborne as well as Wallan as well as many other small towns.\n\nThe Division was proclaimed at the redistribution of 14 September 1984, and was first contested at the 1984 federal election. It was named after Sir John McEwen, leader of the Australian Country Party from 1958 to 1971, who served as caretaker Prime Minister of Australia after the disappearance of Harold Holt in 1967.\n\nWhile classed as rural, it is actually a hybrid urban-rural seat. The urban portion is located in Labor's traditional heartland of north Melbourne, while the rural portion votes equally strongly for the Liberals and Nationals. As a result, for most of its existence it has been highly marginal. Unlike most marginal seats with similar demographics, however, McEwen is not considered a barometer for winning government. All but one of its members has spent at least one term in opposition.\n\nThe 2007 election resulted in McEwen becoming the most marginal seat in the country. Incumbent Liberal MP Fran Bailey led throughout most of the initial count, and was initially found to have lost to former Labor state MLC Rob Mitchell by six votes. Bailey subsequently requested and was granted a full recount, which overturned Mitchell's win and instead gave Bailey a twelve-vote victory. The result was challenged in the High Court of Australia in its capacity as the Court of Disputed Returns, and was referred to the Federal Court of Australia. Over seven months after the election and a review of 643 individual votes, the court altered the formal status of several dozen, eventually declaring Bailey the winner by 27 votes, later amended to 31 votes. Following the resolution of the long-running dispute, Bailey called for a total overhaul of the voting system.\n\nBailey retired at the 2010 election where Mitchell again stood as the Labor candidate and won amid a considerable swing to Labor in Victoria that allowed Julia Gillard to form a minority government. Ahead of the 2013 election, a redistribution pushed McEwen further into Melbourne, increasing Labor's notional majority from a marginal 5.3 percent to a fairly safe 9.2 percent. However, Mitchell barely retained the seat against former Liberal MLC Donna Petrovich with a majority of just 0.15 percent—a margin of just 313 votes—which made McEwen the most marginal seat in Australia. Mitchell won a third term in 2016 Australian federal election on a swing of over seven percent, boosting his majority to 57 percent, the strongest result in the seat's history.\n\n"}

His reign was marred by uprisings, which would eventually lead to his suicide in 1803 to prevent an Ashanti civil war.\n\nOsei Kwame Panyin was born at some point between 1762 and 1765, to a woman named Akyaama, and Safo Kantanka, the King of Mampong. At the time, the region was a founding part of the Ashanti Empire, and was known as the Islamic gateway to the empire due to its location in the north.\n\nPrior to his death, the Ashanti King Osei Kwadwo Okoawia had declared Panyin to be his successor. However, upon Okoawia's death in 1777, when Panyin was around 17 years old, Okoawia's family members and councillors decided to ignore the former ruler's wishes resulting in an uprising by Atakora Kwame. He led an army to the Ashanti capital, Kumasi, and the northern provinces rose up in support of Panyin. Shortly after Panyin was made Asantehene (King), Kwame was overthrown from his position as councillor, leaving Panyin to deal with the political involvement of the former Queen Mother Konadu Yaadom.\n\nPanyin consolidated his position over the course of the 1780s by removing former councillors from their positions and replacing them with allies. Where they could not be replaced, Panyin had those officials executed. Following the death of Yaadom's son Opoku Kwame, she accused the King of poisoning him. After Panyin refused to attend the Odwira festival, Yaadom took this as a reason to rise up against him, eventually placing Panyin under house arrest. She then proceeded to execute Panyin's former high-ranking allies.\n\nHe fled his captors, and briefly found romance in Ama Sewaa, although he would be accused of undertaking an incestuous relationship with her. When Yaadom gathered the majority of the Ashanti clans against Panyin in 1803, he committed suicide rather than trigger a civil war.\n"}

Many file systems in use only supported short filenames. Computer memory and speed was very limited, with 33 MHz CPUs only being accessible to consumers at the end of the decade.\n\n\nFTP, IRC and Usenet were the main vehicles for file sharing in this decade. Data compression technologies for audio and video (like MP3, AAC and MPEG) came into use towards the end of the 1990s. Copper wire was common with fibre optic cable only becoming available late in the decade.\n\n\nIn computer science terms, modern file sharing begins in the 2000s. Several file sharing protocols and file formats were introduced, along with nearly a decade in protocol experimentation. Towards the end of the 2000s, BitTorrent became subject to a \"man in the middle\" attack in TCP mode – and this has led most file sharing protocols to move to UDP towards the very end of the decade.

The station is currently owned by iHeartMedia, Inc..\n\nMost of the station's daytime programming is from co-owned KFAN in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and nighttime programming is from ESPN Radio.\n\nIn 1923, the University of North Dakota started KFJM. This station carried educational as well as commercial programming, which had since 1929 been overseen by Dalton LeMasurier of Grand Forks. As part of this venture, in addition to studios and a transmitter on the university campus, KFJM maintained studios in the First National Bank building downtown.\n\nThe University of North Dakota began planning in March 1941 to unwind this arrangement and exit the commercial broadcasting business, which resulted in the award to LeMasurier of a second license. On November 1, 1941, KILO signed on, sharing the 1440 kHz frequency with KFJM. Under the arrangement, KFJM broadcast from 3 to 5 p.m. each day, with KILO broadcasting at other times and frequently assuming those hours in the summer. In a 10-year contract with the university, LeMasurier was responsible for the maintenance of the transmitter shared by the two licenses, as well as other equipment which was owned by the university, and paid $250 a month to UND. The entire KFJM commercial operation transferred to the new license, including staff and advertising contracts; no new construction was involved. A national network affiliation was stated as being in the offing when KILO launched, and this came to fruition on January 1, 1942, when KILO became an affiliate of the Mutual Broadcasting System. Jack Horner, who later worked in Minnesota, worked at commercial KFJM prior to the split and returned to KILO in 1942 to call Grand Forks Chiefs baseball games.\n\nLeMasurier sold KILO in 1948 to the \"Grand Forks Herald\" newspaper, which surrendered a construction permit it held to build a station at 1260 kHz. KFJM was authorized to move to 1370 kHz and resume full-time broadcasts in February 1957, leaving KILO alone on 1440; the end of the arrangement also saw KILO move to a new transmitter site. The \"Herald\" owned KILO until 1962, when it sold the station to Carl Bloomquist of Eveleth, Minnesota. Bloomquist, through KILO, Inc., paid $125,000.\n\nThe Ingstad family acquired KILO from Bloomquist in 1973, paying $300,000 for the station. It was the Tom Ingstad Radio Group's first purchase. Immediately upon the Red River Valley Broadcasting Company assuming control, the call letters were changed to KKXL. Under Ingstad, KKXL added a simulcasting FM, KKXL-FM 105.3 (known as KKDQ between 1975 and 1981), which started on December 23, 1974. A 1982 windstorm collapsed the station's tower on the Fourth of July; the AM returned the next day and the FM a night later.\n\nIn 1985, Vaughns, Inc., acquired six Ingstad-owned radio stations, including KKXL-AM-FM, for nearly $9 million; general manager Duane Cariveau was tapped to head the new station group from Grand Forks. Cariveau and other managers of the KKXL stations, organized as Excel Broadcasting, bought the pair from Vaughns three years later. KKXL AM was broadcasting country music by 1994 but flipped to talk and sports in 1996.\n\nIn 1997, Excel sold the stations—to the Ingstads, who at the time were also buying two other Grand Forks radio stations, for $2.75 million. That year, the stations were off air for months as the result of another tower collapse and the flooding of the Red River. Upon returning to the air, the station aired an adult standards format from Westwood One. In a 10-station transaction involving stations in the Grand Forks market and in the state of Washington in 1999, Clear Channel acquired KKXL-AM-FM; the stations together fetched $19.71 million.\n\nIn 2002, KKXL, which had returned to a talk format, became a sports talk outlet using KFAN programming.\n"}

He is known for his outrageous antics, such as running around aimlessly and screaming wildly when the opening ring bell sounds, and speaking in a rambling and mostly incoherent fashion. He is the head booker and the Senior Producer of Ring of Honor Television, while also running the company's wrestling school, the ROH Dojo.\n\nDelirious started his career in Gateway Championship Wrestling, an independent wrestling promotion based out of St. Louis while also working at his local Best Buy. He trained Daizee Haze as a wrestler while they were both in Southeast Missouri State University. He made several appearances with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling from 2003 to 2005, his last in a match being a losing effort to Samoa Joe on \"TNA Impact!\".\n\nDelirious started working for Ian Rotten and Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South during the latter part of 2003. In November, he wrestled Matt Sydal, a fellow St. Louis wrestler, in Sydal's first IWA match. The two quickly developed a rivalry, wrestling several times over the next few months. Eventually, Delirious was able to beat Sydal at the second night of the 2004 King of the Death Match Tournament and won the IWA-MS Light Heavyweight Championship.\n\nAfter that, Delirious began a feud with Jimmy Jacobs. The two exchanged in several matches with the title trading hands. Jimmy won the belt in early August on a Coliseum Championship Wrestling event in Evansville, Indiana. Two weeks later in Highland, Indiana, they wrestled to a double pin for the title. The belt was declared vacant. On the first night of the 2004 Ted Petty Invitational weekend, Jacobs won a Ladder match to win the vacant title. After that, Delirious went to Japan for a tour. When he returned, he won the belt on December 12. Delirious then finished the feud with a win in a Steel Cage match in Valparaiso, Indiana on February 4, 2005.\n\nDelirious held the Light Heavyweight title until June 11, when he lost it to Josh Abercrombie in Philadelphia. Delirious then wrestled several matches over the fall, against the likes of Roderick Strong, Ace Steel, and Brandon Thomaselli. He also formed a team with old rival Sydal. They challenged The Iron Saints for the IWA-MS Tag Team Championships on a couple of occasions, but could not win the belts.\n\nDelirious started to appear less in 2006, but he defeated fellow masked wrestler El Generico in April.\n\nDelirious debuted in the Philadelphia-based promotion Ring of Honor at \"Reborn: Stage One\" on April 23, 2004 in a losing effort against rival Matt Sydal. Delirious continued to work for Ring of Honor sporadically throughout the next few years, gaining a cult following despite never winning a match. At \"Better Than Our Best\" on April 1, 2006, ROH's commissioner Jim Cornette said that he would face a wrestler of his choosing and if he did not win, he would be dropped from the roster. Delirious chose and defeated Ricky Reyes with the Cobra Stretch, retaining his spot on the roster.\n\nThe following show, Delirious defeated Jimmy Rave, Jimmy Yang and Jimmy Jacobs in a Four Corner Survival. Later in the show, Bryan Danielson granted Delirious a shot at the ROH World Championship after Danielson had retained it in five minutes against Colt Cabana. Danielson retained the belt when the referee stopped the match; Delirious' hand was also sliced on the ring post and his mask was torn by Danielson during the match.\n\nDelirious would get a second shot at the ROH World Championship in a losing effort against Bryan Danielson on May 13. Delirious went on to earn a shot at the ROH Pure Championship against Nigel McGuinness, but subsequently lost. Throughout the rest of the year, Delirious continued to impress with matches against Matt Sydal and McGuinness. On October 6, Delirious defeated Jimmy Rave, qualifying for the 2006 Survival of the Fittest final later on in the evening. Austin Aries was the first eliminated in the finals leaving The Briscoe Brothers (Jay and Mark), Delirious and Matt Sydal. Sydal and Delirious worked together to eliminate the Briscoes. They put on a tough performance, with Delirious eventually coming out on top.\nHis victory meant he'd receive his third shot at the ROH World Championship against Bryan Danielson. On November 3 the match took place, and once again Danielson retained despite Delirious' best efforts.\n\nDelirious then teamed with Davey Richards, challenging eventual Tag Team Champions Matt Sydal and Christopher Daniels in a Number One Contenders match.\n\nFollowing his loss, Sydal and Daniels went on to feud with \"Scrap Iron\" Adam Pearce. Pearce defeated Delirious earlier on in the year with help from Shane Hagadorn. His first match in this new feud saw Delirious team with Ace Steel to take on Hagadorn and Pearce, Delirious and Steel came out on top, but this feud was far from over. The following night, Delirious put his problems with Pearce aside to challenge Danielson. The two captains put a team of four together for an eight-man elimination tag match. Delirious chose Nigel McGuinness, Colt Cabana and B.J. Whitmer as his partners to face the team of Danielson, Jimmy Rave, Jimmy Jacobs and Shingo. Delirious was the sole survivor for his team, winning the match when he made Danielson tap to the Cobra Stretch.\n\nDelirious lost to Adam Pearce on December 22, as well as losing the following night in a Dragon Gate rules match against CIMA, Shingo and Matt Sydal. Delirious continued his feud with Pearce into 2007, defeating him in the first of six \"Fifth Year Festival\" events. He won via pinfall after placing brass knuckles in his mask and headbutting Pearce. The following night, the newly turned heel Roderick Strong destroyed Delirious after shoving him off the ropes. Delirious' head smacked against the mat and he appeared to be unconscious. Strong took advantage of Delirious' condition, hitting him with a Gibson Driver both in the ring and on a barricade at ringside. Strong looked to do more damage but Roderick's former tag team partner Austin Aries ran him off.\n\nOn August 3, 2007 Delirious was announced as the new head trainer of the ROH Wrestling Academy.\n\nDelirious became more peculiar during his feud with Adam Pearce's stable, The Hangmen 3. After they stapled his mask to his face back in 2007, he began using violent tactics to defeat them such as using weapons and spitting mist into their faces. He also changed his usual green and black attire to \"Red Poison\", a red and black version, at \"Rising Above\" on December 29, 2007, to reflect his newly violent tactics.\n\nDelirious later attempted to gain the attention of Daizee Haze only to be interrupted and overshadowed by Rhett Titus. After seeing footage of Titus and Haze together, he turned heel and joined up with Jimmy Jacobs and his Age of the Fall stable and began wearing a black version of his attire. On March 13 in Collinsville, Illinois, after Jacobs hit Haze with his spike, Delirious turned on him and broke away from the Age of the Fall. Delirious then started a feud with Sonjay Dutt, which ended rather quickly. Delirious later feuded with Austin Aries, starting on the May 3, 2010 edition of \"Ring of Honor Wrestling\", when Aries kicked Delirious in the throat mid-match, causing a disqualification, followed by a beat down of both Delirious and his valet, Daizee Haze by Aries, Kenny King, and Rhett Titus. He teamed with Jerry Lynn to feud with them.\n\nOn August 15, 2010, Johnston replaced Adam Pearce as the head booker of Ring of Honor. Since this change, Delirious has wrestled only sporadically for the promotion, when he ended his feud with Aries by defeating him in a steel cage match on the September 20 episode of \"Ring of Honor Wrestling\". Delirious made his return to a Ring of Honor ring on May 7 in Toronto, when he wrestled Colt Cabana in a Larry Sweeney tribute match. His booking style has been criticized due to lack of character development.\n\nIn 2014, he began to increase his appearances in Ring of Honor more, mainly in their Illinois-based shows. On May 19, 2018, he became one of the trainers at the Baltimore Dojo.\n\nDelirious and Matt Sydal debuted at \"No Excuses 2005\" against each other with Delirious picking up the victory with the Chemical Imbalance II. He won IWC's biggest event of the year, the Super Indy 5 tournament, when he defeated Glen Spectre in the first round, Matt Sydal in the second and \"Balls Hott\" Troy Lords in the finals. He then went on to successfully defend his Super Indy title against Lords by making him tap out to a leglock submission at \"Summer Sizzler 3\".\nHe then started to be accompanied by women's wrestler Daizee Haze at ring side. He successfully defended his title against \"The Fallen Angel\" Christopher Daniels at \"Uncaged Fury\". At \"No Excuses 2\", Delirious began a feud with \"The Fabulous\" John McChesney. Haze distracted McChesney enough for Delirious to roll him up and grab his tights for the win to retain his title. At \"Reveangence 3\" Delirious defeated McChesney again with some help from Daizee Haze. At \"November Pain 2\", Delirious faced McChesney once again, but this time Haze was barred from ringside. Daizee disguised herself as a wrestling fan but McChesney caught on before she could intervene, resulting in McChesney powerbombing Daizee onto Delirious to get the win. At \"New Beginning 2\", Delirious faced Sterling James Keenan to try to stop Keenan's road to the title. He was not successful, as Keenan hit the MK Ultra for the victory. He then took a break from IWC and did not return until several months later. He returned at \"November Pain 3\" as he was scheduled to be partners with Super Hentai to face \"The Shooter\" Brent Albright and Sebastian Dark but it ended up being a 6-man tag team match after Shirly Doe and Delirious' rival John McChesney was added to the match. Shirly Doe picked up the victory by pinning Sebastian Dark after an over the shoulder back to belly piledriver to pick up the win for himself, Delirious, and Super Hentai. Delirious appeared at IWC's 100th show \"Call to Arms 4\" on December 8, 2007 and defeated Eric Young. Throughout the spring and summer of 2008, he unsuccessfully went for the Super Indy title against Larry Sweeney and the IWC Championship against Dennis Gregory. Along with this, Gregory began making chauvinistic threats to Daizee Haze. This eventually climaxed with Delirious and Haze defeating Gregory and Sara Del Rey at \"Boiling Point 3\". Two months later, at \"Promotional Consideration Paid For By the Following: Day 2\", Delirious finally regained the Super Indy title, pinning Jason Gory in a Fatal Four Way match that also involved Super HENTAI and Larry Sweeney.\n\nIn Chikara, Delirious teamed with Hallowicked throughout 2006 under the team moniker Incoherence (also nicknamed Halirious by the fans). The team came about at Chikara's Tag World Grand Prix in 2006 when Hallowicked's original partner, UltraMantis Black, was unable to compete due to injury. A random draw to determine Hallowicked's partner took place and Delirious was the first chosen wrestler to be present, after The Rockin' Rebel and Roderick Strong. After defeating the team of Rorschach and Crossbones, Up in Smoke (Cheech and Cloudy), and Team DDT (KUDO and MIKAMI), the team went on to the semi-finals in the tournament, where they lost to The Kings of Wrestling (Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli). The team has been moderately successful since then, winning the Campeonatos de Parejas on October 26 at \"Bruised\". Delirious and Hallowicked have also taken to teaming with Cheech and Cloudy (aliases:  Deliriouscito and Hallowickedcito) in 3 and 4-man tag team matches. The duo also currently hold the record for most number of successful title defenses of the Campeonatos De Parejas, currently at five successful defenses, including a rematch against the former champions, F.I.S.T. On September 21, 2008, Incoherence lost the titles to the Super Smash Bros. (Player Uno and Player Dos) in Cleveland, Ohio at \"Laying in the Gutter, Looking at the Stars\".\n\nOn May 23, 2009, Delirious was revealed as the new third member of the \"rudo\" (heel) stable The Order of the Neo-Solar Temple, joining UltraMantis Black and Crossbones, after having been abducted by them a month earlier. He was under the influence of UltraMantis' Eye of Tyr, a mysterious jewel that had the ability to control the mind of anyone, so long as it was touched on their foreheads. He came out wearing the colors of the Order and did not run around and scream at the opening bell. He defeated Arik Cannon that night, using UltraMantis Black's Praying Mantis Bomb finisher. The next night, he and the Order defeated the Super Smash Bros. and Create-A-Wrestler, Delirious again using the Praying Mantis Bomb to pick up the win. On November 22, 2009, at Season 8 finale \"Three-Fisted Tales\" Delirious and UltraMantis Black defeated Delirious' former team mates Hallowicked and Frightmare to earn their third point, which means that they can now challenge for the Campeonatos de Parejas. However, that same night UltraMantis lost possession of the Eye of Tyr to Tim Donst and the \"rudo\" stable Bruderschaft des Kreuzes, led by Ares and Claudio Castagnoli. Delirious and UltraMantis Black used their three points to get a match for the Campeonatos de Parejas on February 28, 2010, at \"A World of Comforting Illusions\", but were defeated by the defending champions The Colony (Fire Ant and Soldier Ant), after Ares came out and used the Eye of Tyr to release Delirious from under the influence of UltraMantis, at which point he went crazy and ran out of the arena.\n\nDelirious returned to Chikara on May 22 at \"Aniversario Zehn\", revealing himself as the newest member of BDK and helping Ares defeat UltraMantis Black in a singles match. The following day at \"Aniversario Elf\" Delirious was instrumental in helping Castagnoli and Ares retain the Campeonatos de Parejas against his former Incoherence team mates Hallowicked and Frightmare. At the following show, \"We Must Eat Michigan's Brain\", on June 26, Delirious was defeated by UltraMantis Black in a singles match. On October 23 Delirious represented BDK in the \"torneo cibernetico\" match, where they faced a team composed of Chikara originals. He was eliminated from the match by UltraMantis Black. In April 2011, Delirious represented BDK in the 2011 King of Trios, alongside Tim Donst and Jakob Hammermeier. After defeating Da Soul Touchaz in the first round, the team was eliminated from the tournament in the quarterfinals by The Colony (Fire Ant, Green Ant and Soldier Ant). During the tournament the BDK representatives were confronted by Delirious' former partners Hallowicked, Frightmare and UltraMantis Black, the last of whom had announced his intention of righting his past wrongs, namely his manipulation of Delirious. Delirious, seemingly remembering his past, ran out of the arena, while the rest of BDK began brawling with the trio also known as the Spectral Envoy. UltraMantis Black eventually recovered the Eye of Tyr on November 13, 2011, at High Noon and in January 2012 used it to release Delirious from BDK. However, on February 25, 2012, Delirious attacked UltraMantis in the middle of Spectral Envoy's match against F.I.S.T. for the Campeonatos de Parejas, resulting in F.I.S.T. retaining their title. The next night, Delirious, now able to speak in a coherent, intelligible manner due to smashing the Eye of Tyr, cut a promo stating that he remembered everything he had suffered while under the control of the Eye of Tyr and its holders, and he vowed to make UltraMantis suffer until 2014 as revenge for the two years that he had lost since UltraMantis first used the Eye of Tyr on him. On June 2 at , Delirious formed a new alliance with Kobald, Kodama and Obariyon of The Batiri. At the following pay-per-view, Under the Hood on December 2, Delirious, Kobald, Kodama, Obariyon and Ophidian were defeated in a ten-man tag team match by UltraMantis Black, Frightmare, Hallowicked, Blind Rage and Crossbones, with Delirious being pinned by UltraMantis for the win.\n\nAfter Chikara's one-year hiatus, Delirious returned to the promotion, re-joining BDK on October 26, 2014. On December 6 at Tomorrow Never Dies, Delirious was defeated by UltraMantis Black and was, as a result, forced to leave the promotion. After the match, Delirious used the Eye of Tyr to turn Hallowicked and Frightmare against UltraMantis.\n\nIn late 2009 Delirious began working for Japanese wrestling promotion Pro Wrestling Noah, making his debut on October 15 in a tag team match, where he and Keith Walker defeated Makoto Hashi and Yoshinari Ogawa. The following day he entered the round robin stage of the 2009 Junior Heavyweight League, losing to Katsuhiko Nakajima in his first match in the tournament. On October 18 Delirious scored a major upset victory in his second match in the tournament, by defeating former three-time GHC Junior Heavyweight Champion Kenta and followed that up with another victory over Ricky Marvin on October 22. Despite losing his fourth match in the tournament to Kotaro Suzuki, Delirious made it to the semifinals of the tournament, where he was defeated by Jushin Thunder Liger on October 31. Delirious returned to Noah in April 2010 and on April 25 he received a shot at the GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship, but was defeated by the defending champion Yoshinobu Kanemaru. In July 2011, Delirious and fellow ROH performer, Eddie Edwards, took part in Noah's 2011 Nippon TV Cup Jr. Heavyweight Tag League. After two wins and two losses, Delirious and Edwards finished third in their block, missing the finals of the tournament.\n\n\n"}

In 22 career games, Holloman pitched 65.1 innings and posted a win-loss record of 3–7 and a 5.23 earned run average (ERA).\n\nBorn in Thomaston, Georgia, Holloman served in World War II before starting his professional baseball career. From 1946 to 1952, he gradually rose up the minor leagues, and got a spring training invitation from the Chicago Cubs in 1950. After the 1952 season, he was acquired by the St. Louis Browns, who placed him on the major league roster. He made his debut April 18, and in his first start on May 6, he threw a no-hitter, the only player to do so since 1900. Holloman pitched in 22 games that season for the Browns before being sold to a minor league team. He spent the rest of 1953 and 1954 in the minors before retiring from the game. After retiring, he ran an advertising agency and worked as a scout before his death in 1987.\n\nHolloman was born in Thomaston, Georgia, and moved to Athens, Georgia with his family when he was 17. In Athens, he met Nan Stevens, the two were married on January 24, 1942, and they later had one son. He served as a Seabee for the United States Navy during World War II. After returning from the war, Holloman became an apprentice in a machine shop for the Georgia Railroad in Macon, Georgia. While working there, he played amateur baseball, and did well enough for his colleagues to convince him to try out for the Macon Peaches, the local baseball team. He did so, and he was assigned to the Class D Moultrie Packers, where he began his professional career.\n\nHolloman began his professional baseball career by recording a 20–5 record and a 2.33 ERA for the Packers as a rookie in the Class D Georgia–Florida League in 1946. He played winter baseball in Cuba, then had a record of 18–17 for the Macon Peaches of the Sally League the next year. He started the 1948 season with Macon, then after winning eight games he was promoted to the Nashville Volunteers of the Class AA Southern Association, where he posted seven wins and two losses. While there, Volunteers owner Larry Gilbert gave him the nickname Bobo because the pitcher reminded him of Bobo Newsom; the nickname stuck with him the rest of his career.\n\nIn 1949, Holloman again spent the season with the Volunteers, posting a record of 17–10 with a 4.46 ERA. After the season ended, the Chicago Cubs signed him and gave him an invitation to spring training. Holloman's outgoing nature clashed with manager Frankie Frisch, who did not appreciate the pitcher's attitude. It was, partially, for this reason that Holloman did not make the major league roster. Holloman split the 1950 season between Nashville and the Shreveport Sports of the Texas League. Combined, he had 13 wins and 13 losses on the year. In 1951, he spent seven games with Nashville, but spent most of the season with the Augusta Tigers of the Sally League, where he posted an 11–9 record and a 3.87 ERA.\n\nThe following season, Augusta sold his contract to the Syracuse Chiefs of the AAA International League, and he posted a 16–7 record and a 2.51 ERA with the team. After the season ended, he played winter baseball in Puerto Rico for the Cangrejeros de Santurce. With Santurce, he had a 15–5 record during the regular season. After the season ended, he participated in the 1953 Caribbean Series, and won two of the six games Santurce played, allowing them to win the title.\n\nIn October 1952, Holloman was signed by the St. Louis Browns after they traded Duke Markell and $35,000 to acquire him. Heading into the season, manager Marty Marion was high on him, considering him to be a pitcher who could have won 20 games with Syracuse the year prior had he not missed time due to an appendectomy.\n\nHolloman made his major league debut on April 14 in a relief appearance. He made in three additional relief appearances afterward, allowing five runs in 5⅓ innings through his first four games. As a result, Holloman asked Marion for a start, claiming he was better in that role, and if he was just going to be used as a relief pitcher, he should be sold to another team. Marion gave in, and put him in for a home game on May 6 against the Philadelphia Athletics. On a rainy night before a crowd of 2,473 at Sportsman's Park, Holloman threw a no-hitter in his first major league start. He had two hits as a batter, and recorded three strikeouts en route to the 6–0 victory. In his autobiography, Browns owner Bill Veeck called Holloman's no-hitter \"the quaintest no-hitter in the history of the game,\" saying that his pitches were \"belted\" all night but he was saved by luck and outstanding defense.\n\nHolloman is one of three pitchers to throw a no-hitter in their first major league start. The others were Ted Breitenstein, who accomplished the feat in 1891, and Bumpus Jones, who did so in 1892. However, Breitenstein and Jones threw their no-hitters before the 1893 rule change that moved the pitcher's delivery point back to 60 feet, six inches from home plate.\n\nThe no-hitter cemented Holloman's spot in the starting rotation for the next month. In his next start against the Athletics, he lasted barely an inning, allowing two runs and three walks before leaving the game due to a blistered finger. His next win came on May 28 against the Cleveland Indians, but his third win did not come until a month later against the Boston Red Sox, where he allowed two hits in eight innings of work. Outside of the three wins, however, Holloman was ineffective; in 22 games, 10 of them starts, Holloman had a 3–7 record with a 5.23 ERA, 25 strikeouts, and 50 walks. As a result, after his final appearance on July 19, the Browns put him on waivers, and he was sold to the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nHolloman finished the 1953 season with Toronto, and had a 4–3 record in 13 games. In 1954, Holloman's last professional season, he spent time on five different minor league squads, including former stops Toronto and Augusta, before retiring. The retirement was partially due to a sore arm, the result of pitching too frequently while playing winter ball. After retiring, Holloman became a truck driver and ran an advertising agency, and served as a scout for the Baltimore Orioles. He also turned to drinking for many years, but was able to overcome the addiction. He died on May 1, 1987 at the age of 64 in Athens, Georgia of a heart attack.\n\n\n"}

His title before succeeding his father was Lord Drumlanrig.\n\nEducated at the University of Glasgow, he was appointed a Scottish Privy Counsellor in 1684, and was lieutenant-colonel of Dundee's regiment of horse. He supported William III in 1688 and was appointed colonel of the Scots Troop, Horse Guards Regiment. On his father's death in 1695 he succeeded to several titles, including 2nd Duke of Queensberry.\n\nHe was appointed Lord High Treasurer of Scotland from 1693 and Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland from 1695 to 1702. In 1696 he was appointed as Extraordinary Lord of Session. He was Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland in 1700, 1702 and 1703, in which role he procured the abandonment of the Darien scheme. He was appointed a Knight of the Garter in 1701.\n\nOn the accession of Queen Anne in 1702, Douglas was appointed Secretary of State for Scotland. He encouraged the Jacobites by his undecided attitude on the question of the settlement, and was deluded into unconsciously furthering the Jacobite designs of Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat. Lovat had used Queensberry's jealousy of the duke of Atholl to obtain a commission from him to get evidence in France which would implicate Atholl. The plot was betrayed to Atholl by Robert Ferguson, and Douglas withdrew from government in 1704.\n\nHe was reinstated as Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland in 1705, was a commissioner of the estates in 1706, and procured the signing of the Treaty of Union in 1707. For this he was very unpopular in Scotland, but he received a pension of £3,000 a year. He was created Duke of Dover, Marquess of Beverley and Earl of Ripon in 1708, and appointed to the British Privy Council in the same year. He was Secretary of State for Scotland from 1709 until his death. Queensberry died at his house in Albemarle Street, Piccadilly, in 1711, of an \"iliack passion\" (intestinal obstruction). He was later reburied with his wife Marie at Durisdeer Parish Church in Nithsdale.\n\nQueensberry House in Edinburgh is today part of the Scottish Parliament Building.\n\nHe married Mary Boyle, daughter of The Viscount Dungarvan and had at least 3 children:\n"}

He was educated at Ratcliffe College, Leicestershire, and Norwood College, Harrogate, and started acting in the theatre at the age of 16. During the Second World War he served in the British Army as a lieutenant with the 27th Lancers, and was seriously wounded when his armoured car was hit by artillery fire in Italy. In 1956, Alexander appeared on stage in \"Ring For Catty\" at the Lyric Theatre in London. He is probably best remembered as Charlie Hungerford from the detective series \"Bergerac\", though he was also very prominent in the 1967 BBC adaptation of \"The Forsyte Saga\". One of his early roles was in the children's series \"Garry Halliday\". He also appeared in one episode of \"Please Sir\" in 1970 as the headmaster of a rival school.\n\nAlso in 1970, Alexander played Lord Uxbridge in Sergei Bondarchuk's war epic \"Waterloo\".\n\nAlexander appeared in many other film and television roles including three appearances in different roles in \"The Champions\", \"The Avengers\", \"The Persuaders!\" (Powerswitch), \"Terry and June\" (1979–1980), \"Behind the Screen\" (1981–1982), the 1985 \"Doctor Who\" serial \"The Mark of the Rani\", and \"The New Statesman\" (1987). On radio he starred as \"The Toff\" in the BBC radio adaptation of the John Creasey novels. He appeared in all but one episode of \"Bergerac\" from 1981 to 1991. He also played Commander Duffield in the 1985 pilot episode of \"Dempsey and Makepeace\", Armed and Extremely Dangerous.\n\nAlexander appeared on the West End in comedies and farces, and his credits included \"Move Over Mrs Markham\" (1971), \"Two and Two Make Sex\" (1973), \"There Goes The Bride\" (1974–75) and \"Fringe Benefits\" (1976).\n\nBy the time of \"Bergerac\" Alexander was blind in one eye due to a condition of the retina. He retired from acting in 1999, suffering from Parkinson's disease. He lived in London with his second wife, the actress Jane Downs. He died on 28 May 2009 aged 86.\n\n"}

Gerrard returned the favor by producing their first album, \"Sea Shanties\", which was released in October 1969. Though it met with a scathing review in \"Melody Maker\", reviews in the underground press were universally positive, and sales were just enough to convince Liberty to give the green light to a second album.\n\nThis second album, \"High Tide\", was released the following year. A third album was being recorded in 1970, but Roger Hadden, who had been suffering from chronic mental instability and depression since before joining High Tide, had a mental breakdown and was hospitalized before the album could be finished. Unable to continue without Hadden, the group split up.\n\nDuring the late 1970s, Hill and House recorded \"Interesting Times\" as a duo, taking turns playing bass and using a drum machine to replace Roger Hadden. The album featured heavy use of synthesizers, which to an extent supplanted the use of House's violin. The album was originally released as a mail order cassette, and issued on vinyl and CD in 1989 and 1990.\n\nAny possibilities of further recordings from this semi-reunion were dissolved when House rejoined Hawkwind in 1990. However, under the encouragement of drummer Drachen Theaker, Hill pushed out no less than five albums under the High Tide banner by the end of the following year, starting with two discs of retrospective material, and then with three albums recorded by an entirely new band.\n\nThe first retrospective release, \"Precious Cargo\", consists of sessions recorded in 1970 by the original group, but their exact nature is not specified. It has been theorized, however, that they are the rehearsal sessions for their unfinished third album. One song, \"The Great Universal Protection Racket\"(mislabeled on the album as \"Exploration\"), had been recorded for \"Sea Shanties\" but went unreleased at the time due to space constraints. None of the other six songs were used in any earlier recordings.\n\nThe second retrospective album, \"The Flood\", is a collection of demos of various origins. It includes four demos recorded by the original High Tide shortly before their breakup, six demos recorded in 1971 and 1976 by Tony Hill and Peter Pavli with other musicians, and a Peter Pavli solo demo from 1979.\n\nThe new band which recorded the remaining High Tide albums consisted of Tony Hill (guitars and bass), Dave Tomlin (violin and bass), and Drachen Theaker (drums), though various guest musicians also contributed, included a few appearances by Peter Pavli and Simon House. Eschewing the tight, complex compositions which were the staple of the original High Tide, the new band's albums \"Ancient Gates\" and \"The Reason of Success\" consisted almost solely of lengthy improvised performances with little to no compositional basis. Between these two albums was released \"A Fierce Nature\". Tony Hill wrote all the songs on \"A Fierce Nature\" and played everything but the drums.\n\nA two disc compilation album, \"Open Season\", was released in 2000. However, with the exceptions of a new Tony Hill solo track, a new Peter Pavli solo track, and a short track from \"Ancient Gates\", the content was drawn entirely from \"The Flood\" and \"The Reason of Success\".\n\nThe tracks \"Futilist's Lament\" and \"Blankman Cries Again\" are on the United Artists Records 2004 sampler \"All Good Clean Fun\" CD re-package (Liberty 8660902), but High Tide did not appear on the original 1971 LP.\n\n\n"}

Its story centers on the male protagonist Takaaki Kouno, and focuses on the appeal of the female main characters.\n\nThe game was positively received in both sales and popularity. Its original PlayStation 2 release sold more than 82,000 copies in its first week of release in Japan, and it was voted as the third best bishōjo game by the readers of \"Dengeki G's Magazine\" in 2007. It has since received several spin-off titles, including a sequel entitled \"To Heart 2 Another Days\", which was released on February 29, 2008 for Windows, and has also made transitions to other media. There have been six anime adaptations of \"To Heart 2\": an anime television adaptation produced by OLM's Team Iguchi, which was first broadcast in Japan between October 3, 2005 and January 2, 2006; and five original video animation series produced by Aquaplus and Chaos Project. Four manga series, fifteen sets of manga anthologies, three Internet radio shows, two drama CDs, and six novel adaptations based on \"To Heart 2\" have also been produced.\n\n\"To Heart 2\" is a romance \"novel-type adventure game\" in which the player assumes the role of Takaaki Kouno, who begins his second year of high school after reuniting with a childhood friend. Much of its gameplay is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. The text in the game is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Takaaki is talking to, appearing over background artwork. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. A gallery of the viewed CGs and played background music is available on the game's title screen. \"To Heart 2\" follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.\n\nThe game divides each school day of the storyline into four segments. These segments illustrate the events that occur during Takaaki's commute to school, during school, after school, and after he returns home at the end of each day. Depending on the time of the day and the player's actions, he or she may be presented one of three types of events: mandatory events, which occur automatically during certain points in the game's plot line; temporary events, which occur during certain periods of time only if specific conditions are met; or after school events, which occur at the end of each school day.\n\nAt the end of each school day, the player will be given the option to navigate to various locations within the game's setting. Each choosable location is accompanied by an image of a heroine in order to allow the choices to be easier to make. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from. Text progression pauses at these points, and depending on the choices that the player makes, the affection rate of the heroine associated with the event will either increase, decrease, or remain the same. This mechanism determines which direction of the plot the player will progress into, but influences the story only during Konomi's and Karin's plot lines.\n\nIn the PlayStation 2 version, there are nine plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story except Sango and Ruri, who share the same plot line. This is expanded to ten plot lines in the Windows and PlayStation Portable versions with the addition of Sasara's scenario, and further expanded to eleven scenarios in the PlayStation 3 version with the addition of Mio's scenario. In order to view all of the plot lines, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make different decisions to progress the plot in alternate directions. In all versions, the game also contains a bad ending in which the player is unable to pursue the other scenarios. This ending serves as the basis of the Another Days scenario in \"To Heart 2 Another Days\", which allows the player to pursue an additional seven heroines.\n\n\"To Heart 2 X Rated\", the Windows version of the visual novel, includes two additional minigames that serve to lengthen the experience the game provides; these minigames do not affect the main plot in any way. In both minigames, the player controls one of the heroines from \"To Heart 2\" storyline, who is made available upon the completion of her scenario in the main portion of the game. The first of the two minigames, titled , is a scrolling shooter in which the player's goal is to progress through a vertically scrolling level, while attacking enemies that resemble confectioneries and dodging their attacks. The second, titled , is a puzzle game in which the player competes against an opponent for the highest score, by connecting three or more books of the same color and eliminating them from the screen.\n\n\"To Heart 2\" story revolves around the male protagonist Takaaki Kouno, a high school student who has an aversion to most girls around him, and focuses on his interactions with his schoolmates. The story begins on March 1, 2004, when Takaaki's parents leave for an overseas business trip. That morning, Konomi Yuzuhara, Takaaki's childhood friend, comes to meet Takaaki for their commute to school. Konomi is a cheerful and innocent, but childish girl. She is one year younger than Takaaki, who often views her as a younger sister. The two are also friends with Yuuji Kousaka, who is in the same class as Takaaki. Despite being the son of a wealthy and prestigious family, Yuuji has a frivolous and carefree personality, and often flirts with the girls at school. Takaaki later reunites with Tamaki Kousaka, another childhood friend, who had promised to return before being enrolled into a boarding school. Tamaki has a strong and dominant personality, and tends to act as an elder sister figure to those around her. She later transfers into Takaaki's high school upon the beginning of the new school year.\n\nThroughout the story, Takaaki meets several other heroines attending his school. The first is Manaka Komaki, a timid, clumsy, but accommodating girl who is the vice class representative of Takaaki's class. She often spends time in the school library's storage, and helps the library committee with general tasks. Similar to Takaaki, she is inarticulate around the opposite gender. Manaka is also close friends with Yuma Tonami, an aggressive girl who commutes to school by a mountain bike. Yuma sees Takaaki as a rival after she first met him at school, and often challenges him to various duels. She often laments her grandfather's insistence of having her take over the family business, and attempts to hide her family background from Takaaki. Karin Sasamori is a schoolmate of Takaaki's and the founder of the school's mystery club. Karin has a cheerful and energetic personality, and has an odd affection towards the occult and objects such as egg sandwiches. She first meets Takaaki early in the story, and later deceives him into joining the mystery club.\n\nSango Himeyuri is an underclassman who takes a liking to Takaaki. She is lively and innocent, but also intelligent. She is in particular proficient in computer-related subjects, and designed multiple humanoid maid robots as an engineer for Kurusugawa Electronics. Ruri Himeyuri is another underclassman of Takaaki and Sango's younger twin sister. In contrast to her older sister, Ruri has a bad-mouthed and hostile personality. She is very protective of Sango, and often regards Takaaki's interactions with her in bad faith. Lucy Maria Misora is a girl whom Takaaki meets one day on his way home. She has a calm personality and opens up to very few people except him. Lucy claims to be an alien, and speaks a unique language she calls the . She later attends Takaaki's school under the name Rūko Kireinasora. Yūki Kusakabe is a gentle and well-mannered girl who often lingers in the school building at night. She was one of Takaaki's classmates in elementary school, but has since transferred away because of her parents' divorce.\n\nTwo heroines were subsequently added to \"To Heart 2\" story in later versions of the game. Sasara Kusugawa becomes the student council president of Takaaki's school during his second year. She inherits her position from the previous president Ma-ryan, as she is the only remaining student council member after the latter's graduation. Sasara is very diligent, often completing all of the student council's tasks by herself. She is often feared by students for her strict attitude, but is actually disguising a shy and gentle personality. Mio Hanesaki is Takaaki's classmate. She remains largely unnoticed by other students, most of whom remain oblivious of her name. She originally ties her hair up and wears eyeglasses, but later wears contact lens and her hair untied as an attempt by Takaaki to change the impression she gives to others.\n\n\"To Heart 2\" development originally began as a collaborative effort for the PlayStation 2 between the Osaka and Tokyo studios of Aquaplus. During one of the staff meetings for the partnered project, \"To Heart 2\" was conceived when a staff member jokingly mentioned the possibility of a sequel for the original \"To Heart\". Production began shortly after once the team realized the popularity and success of the forerunner. Naoya Shimokawa, the president of Aquaplus, produced the resulting project, and Tsutomu Washimi served as the game's director.\n\nThe work on the game's scenario was split between four writers. Shōsuke Miyake drafted the game's overall storyline as well as the scenarios for Sango, Ruri, and Lucy; Nagare Makura wrote the scenarios for Manaka and Yuma; Takeshi Marui for Karin and Yūki; and Munemitsu for Konomi and Tamaki. Likewise, the game's character designs were split amongst four artists. Misato Mitsumi provided the character designs and illustrations for Konomi and Yuma; Hisashi Kawata for Lucy and Karin; Tatsuki Amazuyu for Tamaki and Manaka; and Takeshi Nakamura for Sango, Ruri, and Yūki. The game's music was composed by Shimokawa, Junya Matsuoka, Shinya Ishikawa, Kazue Nakagami, and Michio Kinugasa.\n\nSince the development staff had an equal number of writers as illustrators, it was originally planned to pair each illustrator with a single scenario writer; Mistumi was also to provide designs for the main heroine. Though this would have simplified the project's workload by easing communications among the staff, the idea was scrapped once the staff realized that the final product might merely be a collection of four distinct pieces. Ultimately, writing and design responsibilities were divided based on the staff members' individual preferences. The staff also commented that the development team faced communication difficulties because of the physical distance between the two Aquaplus studios. Early in production, members from both studios gathered in a single location to discuss development, but as production progressed, they began to rely on other methods of communication such as telephone calls and instant messaging. Washimi noted that these methods made it complicated for the writers and illustrators to communicate effectively, and during the development of \"To Heart 2 X Rated\", Miyake took a two-month-long business trip to Osaka to rectify the problem.\n\nRather than creating a new setting for \"To Heart 2\", the development team chose to roll over various inherent features from the original. The majority of the game is set within the same school and town, but instead focuses on the northern side of town, rather than the southern side, which is the primary setting of \"To Heart\". The story is set two years after \"To Heart\", and its lack of mobile phones was an attempt to replicate the technological themes of its predecessor. Despite the story's inclusion of maid robots, the writers stated that the story's setting was influenced by the 1990s, during which \"To Heart\" took place. As the only artist to return from the original's development team, Kawata was consulted by the other illustrators for character designs. He commented that the other artists attempted to create their designs with respect to the previous work, but he decided otherwise by attempting to \"shape a new image\" for the designs. The illustrators avoided creating a character with green hair as a heroine, because of the overwhelming impression the character Multi had left them in \"To Heart\". Miyake noted that it was difficult for him to write the scenario for \"To Heart 2\" because the game's development began during the time he was writing \"December When There Is No Angel\", and Ruri and Sango's original scenario had to be rewritten because of their overwhelming resemblance to the latter title.\n\n\"To Heart 2\" was first released as an all-ages title for the PlayStation 2 on December 28, 2004 in three versions: a limited edition, a deluxe edition, and a regular edition. The limited edition release contains the game itself, an original soundtrack disc, a visual concept collection, a calendar, and a special casing; the deluxe edition contains the extras included in the limited edition and a version of \"To Heart\" playable on the PS2; the regular edition does not contain the aforementioned extras. The original PS2 version was followed by an adult version entitled \"To Heart 2 X Rated\" (stylized as \"ToHeart2 XRATED\").

Its source code was released by Aquaplus under the GNU General Public License on December 22, 2005 along with the source code for \"Arurū to Asobo!!\", \"Tears to Tiara\", and \"Kusari\". This decision was made due to the inclusion of Xvid derived code; Xvid being distributed under the same license. The source code for all four games is distributed upon request in CD-R format.

{"id": "2156438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156438", "title": "Martlesham", "text": "Martlesham\n\nMartlesham is a village in Suffolk, England about two miles (3 km) South-West of Woodbridge and East of Ipswich. It is often referred to as \"old Martlesham\" by locals in order to distinguish this old village from the much more recent Martlesham Heath development (1 km) to the south although both form a single administrative parish. Also at Martlesham Heath is BT's Research and Development Centre, now called Adastral Park.\n\nMartlesham was recorded in Domesday Book as \"Merlesham\".\nThe history and meaning of the name are studied in a paper by Briggs.\nIt probably means 'settlement (\"hām\") near the mooring-place (\"mǣrels\")'.\n\nIt is believed that there was a Roman settlement at Martlesham and in the parish there have been some 26 finds dating from the Roman occupation. These include pottery, brooches, coins and tesserae. Of particular note was the 19th century find of a small bronze statue of a horse on a plinth, bearing a Latin inscription indicating that this was an offering dedicated by a woman named Simplicia to the god Mars.\n\nMartlesham was mentioned in the Domesday Book, which recorded that it consisted of two and a half carucates of land (equivalent to about of profitable land). At that time there were 10 villagers; 10 smallholders; of meadow; 1 mill; woodland for 16 pigs; 5 cobs; 20 cattle; 27 pigs; 212 sheep; and 12 beehives. There was 1 church with and 1 free man.\n\nMartlesham remained a strongly agricultural area, but the main settlement shifted over the years from the highest ground (where the church and hall are situated) to the point where the main London to Great Yarmouth road crosses the River Finn , a tributary to the Deben. By the mid-15th century, a bridge had been built across the river at this point.\n\nWhite's 1844 directory of Suffolk describes Martlesham as \"a neat village near the confluence of a rivulet with the Deben\" and states that it has in its parish \"510 inhabitants, and of land, partly in rich marshes washed by the tides of the Deben, and partly a large, sandy, and unenclosed heath, extending about S.W., and affording pasturage for numerous herds of sheep and cattle.\"\n\nIn 1917, the Experimental Aircraft Flight of the Central Flying School was transferred from Upavon, Wiltshire to a site on the heathland at Martlesham and, on 16 January 1917, Martlesham Heath Airfield was officially opened as an experimental airfield. It continued in this role after the end of World War I and became a significant RAF airfield during the Second World War. Douglas Bader was briefly stationed at the RAF station in 1940, and a public house \"The Douglas Bader\" now resides on Martlesham Heath. The pub is renowned for arousing contentiousness for passing motorists playing the popular travelling game \"pub cricket\" (a game which has never really been known as sign cricket), as sticklers for the rules will argue it that it scores two when other players try to claim four points.\n\nAfter the closure of the airfield, the lease of its site was sold to Bradford Property Trust, who went on to develop the \"New Village\" of Martlesham Heath to the southwest of \"Old Martlesham\".\n\nMartlesham Main Road sweeps, from the A12 roundabout turn off, north-east. Population of over 5600.\n\nThe headquarters of the Suffolk Constabulary is based in Martlesham, other side of the A12 roundabout.\n\nThe Martlesham site of the Ipswich park and ride service opened in December 2003.\n\nThere are two pubs, Black Tiles (south part of Main Road) and the Red Lion, which was located on the old Norwich to London road. This coaching inn was used as an overnight stopover for the Royal Mail with the post being safely locked up until the morning. The figurehead was a well-known landmark with \"Red as the Martlesham Lion\" being a common expression in the area. The original figure is still outside the pub today. Parts of the building date from the late 16th century, with an early 19th-century wing to the right. A Victorian brewery was also located here.\n\nMartlesham Creek is popular for sailing pursuits. The mouth of which forms the confluence of rivers Fynn and Deben.\n\nSchool Lane marks where the former schoolhouse stood together with plenty of open fields with a view to the creek.\n\nChurch Lane and its surrounding area has been used for Christian worship since at least 1086. The Church of St Mary the Virgin (built 15th century) is down a single track lane at the north east of Martlesham, with fields to the right and woodland to the left. There are many footpaths in the area and a path down to Martlesham Creek crosses through the churchyard. The church has a pulpit dating from 1641 and a 15th-century font by the entrance door.\n\nAn electoral ward in the same name exists. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 4,897.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2156441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156441", "title": "Inwa", "text": "Inwa\n\nInwa or Ava (, or ; also spelled Innwa), located in Mandalay Region, Burma (Myanmar), is an ancient imperial capital of successive Burmese kingdoms from the 14th to 19th centuries. Throughout history, it was sacked and rebuilt numerous times. The capital city was finally abandoned after it was completely destroyed by a series of major earthquakes in March 1839. Though only a few traces of its former grandeur remain today, the former capital is a popular day-trip tourist destination from Mandalay.\n\nThe name Inwa () literally means \"mouth of the Lake\", reflecting its geographical location at the mouth of lakes in the Kyaukse District. Another theory states that it is derived from \"Innawa\" (), meaning \"nine lakes\" in the area. The city's classical name in Pali is Ratanapura (; \"City of Gems\").\n\nThe modern standard Burmese pronunciation is \"Inwa\" (), following the modern orthography. But the local Upper Burmese pronunciation is \"Awa\" (). Indeed, the spelling of the city in the royal records, all written prior to the modern Burmese spelling standardization drives, is (Awa), the phonetic spelling of the Upper Burmese usage. The most common Western transcription Ava comes from \"Awa\" via Portuguese.\n\nInwa was the capital of Burma for nearly 360 years, on five separate occasions, from 1365 to 1842. So identified as the seat of power in Burma that Inwa (as the Kingdom of Ava, or the Court of Ava) was the name by which Burma was known to Europeans down to the 19th century.\n\nStrategically located on the confluence of Irrawaddy, and Myitnge rivers, and in the main rice-growing Kyaukse District of Upper Burma, the location of Ava had been scouted as a possible capital site as early as 1310 by King Thihathu. Though Thihathu eventually built his new capital at Pinya a few miles east inland in 1313, Thihathu's great-grandson Thado Minbya, who unified the Sagaing and Pinya kingdoms in September 1364, chose the site of Inwa as his new capital.\n\nInwa was officially founded on 26 February 1365 (6th waxing of Tabaung 726 ME) on a man-made island created by connecting the Irrawaddy on the north and the Myitnge on the east with a canal on the south and the west. The construction of the artificial island also involved filling in the swamplands and lakes (or \"Ins\"):†\n\n\nThe brick fortifications of Inwa do not follow the conventions of the earlier rectilinear city plans. Instead, the zigzagged outer walls are popularly thought to outline the figure of a seated lion. The inner enclosure or citadel was laid out according to traditional cosmological principles and provided the requisite twelve gates. (The inner city was reconstructed on at least three occasions in 1597, 1763, and 1832.)\n\nThe kingdom Thado Minbya founded with the capital at Inwa became known as the Ava Kingdom, the main polity of Upper Burma until 1555. During this period, the city was the center of a flourishing literary scene in which Burmese literature \"grew more confident, popular, and stylistically diverse, chiefly through the efforts of monks who chose to write in the vernacular rather than, or in addition to, in Pali.\" The period also saw the second generation of Burmese law codes (\"dhammathats\"), which critiqued earlier compilations, new poetic genres, and the perfection of older verse forms as well as the earliest pan-Burma Burmese language chronicles. The city got a new \"exquisite golden palace\" in February 1511 by which King Shwenankyawshin is posthumously remembered.\n\nDuring this period, the capital city was the target of the kingdom's rivals. It came under siege in 1404–1405 during the Forty Years' War. Over a century later, on 25 March 1527, the city finally fell to the repeated attacks by the Confederation of Shan States and the Prome Kingdom. It then became the capital of the unruly and often disunited coalition until 22 January 1555 when it was captured by King Bayinnaung. The city's 190-year run as the capital of Upper Burma came to an end.\n\nThe city became the capital of all Burma during Toungoo and Konbaung periods (1599–1613, 1635–1752, 1765–1783, 1821–1842). The city was the base from which kings Nyaungyan and Anaukpetlun restored the kingdom which had temporarily disintegrated in December 1599. In January 1635, King Thalun moved the capital back to Ava from Pegu (Bago). The city was sacked on 21–23 March 1752, and subsequently burned down on 3 January 1753 by the forces of Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. King Hsinbyushin began the reconstruction of the city in March 1764, and moved the capital back to a newly rebuilt Ava on 23 July 1765. King Bodawpaya moved the capital to Amarapura in May 1783 but his grandson King Bagyidaw moved it back to Ava in November 1821.\n\nThe end of the city came via a natural disaster. Starting on 22 March 1839 (7th waxing of Tagu 1201 ME) the Inwa–Amapura region was hit by a series of earthquakes. The main earthquake hit the region, as far west as Sagaing, the next day, at five o'clock in the morning on 23 March 1839, and many tremors followed for days afterwards. The entire region was left in shambles in their wake. The capital was hardest hit: everything was leveled; many people and livestock perished. The city was not rebuilt. King Tharrawaddy chose instead to rebuild a new palace in Amarapura, and moved the seat of his government there in February 1842.\n\nThe former capital city site is a popular tourist day-trip destination from Mandalay. Tourists can still observe a few remnants of the capital, including Nanmadaw Me Nu Ok Kyaung, the Nanmyin Tower, the inner and outer brick city walls, etc.\n\nInwa is located south of Mandalay. It is on the way from the Mandalay International Airport to Mandalay. Cars can go up to the Myitnge river. It takes a 3-minute boat ride to cross over to the former capital site. On the Inwa side, a number of horse-drawn carts await the tourist business.\n\n\n"}

For example, if a court finds that the plaintiff's painting was stolen by the defendant, then the plaintiff has two possible routes to restore the loss. The plaintiff can \"elect\" to either receive monetary damages equal to the entire value of the painting, \"or\" the plaintiff can ask the court to order the return of the stolen property (plus some minor amount of compensation for the suffering caused by its deprivation). However, the plaintiff cannot have both, and must therefore make an election of one or the other.\n\nUnder the old common law of England, a party had to make an election of remedies at the time that the complaint was filed. Most jurisdictions have since abandoned that requirement. Plaintiffs generally may now file initial pleadings that seek alternative means of relief, and need not make the election of remedies until a judgment is rendered as to the liability of the defendant.\n"}
{"id": "2156458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156458", "title": "Alastair Cook", "text": "Alastair Cook\n\nSir Alastair Nathan Cook (born 25 December 1984) is an English cricketer who plays for Essex County Cricket Club, and formerly for England in all international formats. A former captain of the England Test and One-Day International (ODI) teams, he holds a number of English and international records. He is one of the most prolific batsmen of the modern era. Cook is the fifth highest Test run scorer of all time.\n\nCook is England's most-capped player and has captained the team in an English record 59 Tests and 69 ODIs. He is the leading run-scorer in Test matches for England, and the youngest player to complete 12,000 Test runs (the sixth overall, and the only Englishman). Cook has scored a record 33 Test centuries for England and is the first England player to take part in 50 Test victories. A left-handed opening batsman (the highest scoring left-hander in Tests), he normally fields at first slip.\n\nCook played for Essex's Academy and made his debut for the first XI in 2003. He played in several of England's youth teams from 2000 until his call up to the Test side in 2006. While touring in the West Indies with the ECB National Academy, Cook was called up to the England national team in India as a last-minute replacement for Marcus Trescothick and debuted, aged 21, with a century. He went on to score 1,000 runs in his maiden year and made centuries in his first Test matches against India, Pakistan, the West Indies and Bangladesh. Cook played a pivotal role in England winning the 2009 Ashes series, and, after deputising as Test captain in 2010 and then taking ODI captaincy full-time, in retaining the Ashes in 2010-11.\n\nHe was appointed captain of the Test team after fellow opener Andrew Strauss's retirement on 29 August 2012. Cook captained England to its first Test series victory in India since 1984–85. During the tour he became the first captain to score a century in each of his first five Tests in charge. On 30 May 2015, Cook became the leading run-scorer in Test matches for England, surpassing Graham Gooch (8900). After England's 2016 tour of Bangladesh and India, he stepped down as Test captain. Cook was appointed MBE in 2011 and promoted to CBE in 2016 for services to cricket. On 24 May 2018 during the first Test against Pakistan, Cook equalled Allan Border's record for appearing in the greatest number of consecutive Test matches, with 153, surpassing it a week later in the second Test at Headingley. On 3 September 2018, Cook announced that his twelve-year international career would end at the conclusion of the series against India on 11 September 2018. In the 2019 New Year Honours, Cook was appointed a Knight Bachelor for services to cricket.\n\nOn the occasion of England's 1000th Test in August 2018, he was named in the country's greatest Test XI by the ECB.\n\nBorn in Gloucester, Alastair Cook is one of several players of Anglo-Welsh heritage to play for England; his mother Stephanie is a teacher from Swansea, while his father Graham worked as a telecommunications engineer and enjoyed village cricket. Cook is a keen musician: by the age of eight he was learning the clarinet and became a boarding pupil at St Paul's Cathedral School in London, an independent school connected to the cathedral, as a chorister, with a rigorous schedule of rehearsals. Cook later claimed the amount of focus and concentration required to keep practising while undergoing regular school hours helped with his batting.\n\nAs a boy, his family lived in Wickham Bishops in Essex. During his summer holidays, Cook would play cricket for nearby Maldon Cricket Club, and by the age of 11 he was already playing in the adult Third XI. He played sporadically for Maldon over seven years, with an average of 168 in his final year. He is now an honorary life member of the club.\n\nAged 13, Cook's musical flair led to him to becoming a boarding pupil at Bedford School, an independent school for boys in the county town of Bedford. He \"sang like an angel and played the clarinet to grade eight\". While being educated in Bedford, he learned to play piano and saxophone. However, music was soon eclipsed when the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) came to play against the Bedford School XI. The visiting side were a man short and drafted the 14-year-old new boy to play against his school: Cook scored a century.\n\nOver the next four years, he hit 17 centuries and two double-hundreds to total 4,396 runs at an average of 87.90, captaining the cricket team in his final year under coach Jeremy 'Boris' Farrell, as well as being President of the Music Society. He also gained three A-Levels and nine GCSEs. In his final year at Bedford in 2003, he scored 1,287 runs for the school, including two unbeaten double-hundreds, averaging 160.87 to take the school record. After his international success, Cook returned for an Old Boys' match at Bedford in 2008, playing for the Head Master's Ultimate XI. Later on, Cook spent two years at Alleyn's School as a PE master.\n\nHaving been a member of the Essex Academy since the age of 16, Cook was given his first-class debut for Essex against Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club on leaving school at the end of the 2003 season; put in to field he aided the first dismissal with a catch before scoring just 13 runs in his first innings but pushing Essex to a nine wicket victory with 69 not out in the second. Despite Essex's relegation being assured, Cook still battled away with an opening stand of 122 opposite Will Jefferson in the second innings of his second match, against Warwickshire. In the six innings in which he participated he quickly racked up three half centuries at an average of 47.80. Having secured his place as opener in the county team, he made his maiden first-class century against Leicestershire in May 2004 with 126 opposite Jefferson's 128 for a 265 opening stand, Essex's third highest but the team failed to secure promotion.\n\nHis exploits in his single season gained enough attention for him to be brought in as opening batsman for the MCC in 2005 season's opener against County Champions Warwickshire. With a century in the first innings and 97 in the second, Cook helped secure victory in a match destined for a draw. The season opener would not be Cook's only highlight for the year: as the Ashes approached, Australia were touring the counties and in a two-day match (which did not count towards his first-class statistics) Cook scored a double century and went on to take the first wicket of Justin Langer with a catch in the drawn match days after being awarded PCA Young Cricketer of the Year. A further highlight of the season saw Cook help Essex to achieve one of Durham's two defeats of the season, scoring 107 of Essex's 245 before taking his maiden first-class wicket, followed by another two, with his off-spin. Cook played in every first-class match for Essex and also helped them clinch the Totesport League Title for the first time in 20 years. The end of the season saw Cook finish with an average of 48.03 in the County Championship, hitting four centuries.\n\nAfter his England call up, Cook's appearances at Essex significantly reduced. In the County Championship he appeared in only three matches, making two hundreds and another two fifties in his five innings, topping the season averages with an inflated 141.3. Similarly in the Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy he appeared only three times and again topped the batting averages, only being out once with a top score of 91 and average of 148. He scored less favourably in his one Twenty20 Cup appearance, scoring only nine runs. In the 2007 season, for Essex alone his first-class average was only 58.8 from three appearances, making two hundreds but countering this with one duck and he made a similar century/duck appearance in the (formerly C&G) Friends Provident Trophy during his 5 matches averaging 38.4.\nThe back to back Totesport/Pro40 champions saw Cook make only one appearance in that competition, scoring 81 not out, before being relegated. They won Division Two and were promoted the following season, though Cook only provided 11 runs in one innings during the tournament. Despite his international commitments Cook managed to participate in at least one match of each tournament averaging 36.16 in three County Championship matches and 15 in his one Twenty20 match. Given time off the South Africa One-Day series, Cook fared better in the FP Trophy with 45.3 from 3 matches including contributing the second highest in the final at Lord's to seal the trophy.\n\nThe 2009 English season featured an early Test series against the West Indies where, despite being in the Test team, Cook joined Essex in a tour match. He scored 76 not out in the second innings before the match was rained off, stopping Essex pressing for victory. Before the Test series he helped Essex force the follow on against Kent in the County Championship but faltered with his team, scoring only 4 in the second innings to lose by 192 runs. After the Test series, Cook was omitted from the one day side leaving him free to play for Essex. He joined them in their bid to defend their Friends Provident Trophy matching Varun Chopra's 65 in a 124 run partnership against Lancashire to gain a place in the semi-final. He and his team could not recreate the same form for the semi-final, at the same location against the same team three days later, after being caught from a running catch by Sajid Mahmood, seeing the team lose by 67 runs.\nHaving been knocked out of the FP Trophy, the team turned to the Twenty20 Cup. Making only his fourth appearance in the tournament since 2005, Cook hit 80 off 56 balls in a match against Kent that was rained off. While his England partner Bopara scored 45 against Sussex, Cook only scored one but made up for this with a 60 run partnership with Bopara days later to put Essex top of the table. Despite averaging 49 from these four games, Cook felt he was a long way from the international squad. In his last performance before joining the Ashes squad, Cook scored a 57 ball century, and batted throughout the whole innings as they beat Surrey, but without Cook and Bopara, the team were knocked out after two successive losses.\n\nWhen Cook retired from international cricket in 2018, he stated that he would continue to play for Essex, signing a three-year contract with them. In the 2019 County Championship season Cook helped Essex to win the title\n\nCook had his first taste of international cricket playing the U15 World Cup in 2000. Three years later Cook was called up to the England Under-19 team for their tour of South Africa. After it was decided Samit Patel had enough responsibility batting and bowling, Cook was appointed captain of the team the following year, 2004. His first call of duty was the U19 World Cup in the West Indies where he guided England through the group stages and on past the Super League stage, including an unbeaten century-each partnership with Patel against New Zealand, and continued a 100% win record with 87 over eventual winners Pakistan before falling short in the semi-final against the West Indies. He went on from there to captain them in a U19 Test win over Bangladesh before taking the One-Day series too. His career with the Under 19 team was cut short when Kevin Pietersen was called up to replace Andrew Flintoff in the main team, leaving a spot in England A tour of Sri Lanka for Cook.\n\nAfter the 2005 domestic season he was part of the intake for the ECB National Academy, but this was interrupted as he flew to Pakistan to cover the squad for Michael Vaughan's knee injury. After not being used in the first XI he travelled back with the Academy to the West Indies in the new year scoring 101 in a two-day match against Antigua before youth cricket came to an abrupt halt for Cook.\n\nCook was included in the ECB National Academy in the winter of 2005–06. The Academy's tour of the West Indies was cut short on 24 February for Cook who only appeared in the first innings, scoring only 6, before being called up, alongside James Anderson and Owais Shah, to the England tour of India to replace captain Michael Vaughan, who was suffering from a knee injury, and opener Marcus Trescothick, who was suffering from stress. Unlike Shah and Anderson, Cook was welcomed straight into the England XI and made his Test debut aged 21, days after he had flown in from the West Indies. He made an instant impact, opening with Andrew Strauss and scoring a half century in the first innings before being bowled just before tea on the first day for 60 runs from 160 balls being the second top scorer after 134 from Paul Collingwood. The second innings would prove to cement him in cricket history as he went on to score 104 not out before England declared, making him the sixteenth Englishman to score a century on his debut Test and an even more exclusive list of five to score 100 and 50 in their first Test. His hundred was also the 3,000th century in Test cricket. Despite being known for a patient style of play, an impending declaration forced Cook to play quickly to bring up the century; regardless, the match was drawn. After a mediocre outing in the losing second Test, scoring 17 and 2, he missed the Third Test due to a stomach illness and was omitted from the one-day series.\n\nReturning home, Cook was again selected for the first XI during Sri Lanka's tour. For his debut match at Lord's, Cook was shuffled down to third to make way for the returning Trescothick. However, he still walked to the crease alongside his teammate as Strauss fell at the stroke of lunch. Cook and Trescothick put on 127 in their partnership as Trescothick made a century while Cook later stumbled just before at 89; there was no second innings as England enforced the follow-on but were one wicket away from victory, with Cook being targeted among others for two significant dropped catches. Cook's first taste of victory came in the second Test, guiding the team past the target of 78 in the second innings with an unbeaten 34 alongside Andrew Flintoff furthering the reputation of his calm, meticulous style of play against the dangerous spin of Muttiah Muralitharan who took 4–29. Although not initially selected for the one-day series, Cook made his limited overs debut in the fourth match scoring 39 from 38 balls in a bright spot of an otherwise dour England performance hampered by injuries.\nAt the start of the following series against Pakistan, Cook recorded his second Test century, gaining him a spot on the boards at Lord's alongside Ian Bell and Collingwood. He and Bell both recorded back to back centuries by the following Test at Old Trafford as well as Cook scoring his then-career best 127 in an innings defeat over Pakistan. In what now seemed a pattern, Cook's century came up while partnering with Collingwood as with his previous two. In the controversial forfeited Test, sometimes called Ovalgate, Cook contributed a first innings top score of 40 and second best 83 before Pakistan refused to return to the field. This score secured Cook's tally of runs, 403, as the second highest scorer for England and third overall in the series. Once again Cook was overlooked in the one day series. At the end of the season he was again awarded the Young Player of the Year award as well as being shortlisted for ICC Emerging Player of the Year.\n\nAs well as the one day series against Pakistan, Cook was overlooked for the 2006 Champions Trophy squad. However, he was named for the 2006–07 Ashes series touring party and when Trescothick pulled out once again due to stress, Cook re-earned a spot as an opener for the foreseeable future. In the disastrous 5 Test whitewash, Cook failed to impress in the first two Tests, but during a two-day warm-up he retired with a century and afterwards remained adamant that he and England would make a turn around in the series. With England desperately chasing 577 runs, or a draw to not lose the Ashes, Cook stayed at the crease for over six hours, lasting almost all of the fourth day to earn his maiden Ashes century (119) before being caught behind off Glenn McGrath just shy of three overs before the close of play. This was his fourth Test century before turning 22, no England player had scored more than two by the same age. With only three other batsmen scoring double figures, England lost the Test and the Ashes and despite only having an average of 27.6 runs, Cook scored one of only three English centuries on the tour and also on 28 December 2006 in Melbourne, Cook scored his thousandth Test run, the second cricketer to do this in their maiden year, after Mark Taylor.\n\nFor his performances in 2006, he was named in the World Test XI by Cricinfo.\n\nAfter being omitted for the Twenty20 International against Australia and the 2007 World Cup, Cook found himself once again in favour for the home series against West Indies. Starting at Lord's, Cook found himself among four centurions in the opening innings with Collingwood opposite him once again, being one of only five Englishmen to hit as many centuries in 15 Tests and recorded another half century in the following innings to win his first Man of The Match award. After another half century in the second Test, Cook recorded another half century/century combination in the two innings at Old Trafford, his first innings sixty equating to the team's win margin. Cook was selected for his first Twenty20 International against the West Indies, in a losing effort where he scored 15 runs from 16 balls. This was followed by a disappointing one-day series for Cook, and England, who averaged 22 in 3 matches.\n\nThe following home series against India saw Cook continue his fine Test form despite England not winning a Test. He was the third highest scoring Englishman with an average of 37. In the first Test, Cook made scores of 36 and 17 as the match ended in a draw. During the first day of the second Test at Trent Bridge, Cook became the youngest English player to rack up 1,500 Test runs eclipsing the record held by David Gower. In the first innings of the third Test, Cook made his biggest score of the series, 61 and followed this up with 43 in the second innings to help England secure a draw. Cook played in six of the seven ensuing one-day matches, scoring his maiden ODI century in the first match alongside Ian Bell's 126 not out guiding England to a 104 win victory that propped up England's first one-day series victory since 2005. After two ducks, Cook was dropped in the final, decisive match.\n\nAfter being omitted from the World Twenty20 Cook rejoined England in Sri Lanka making an outstanding contribution in both forms of the game. Starting with another ODI series victory, Cook battled with a stomach virus to top score 47 in a losing match and went on to be the second highest scoring batsmen in the series behind Chamara Silva with 155. Cook also picked up his first ODI Man of The Match award in the fourth game after scoring 80 to help England win by five wickets. After an unsuccessful first Test, Cook went on to be the top scoring Test batsmen for England too, scoring two half centuries in the second Test and 118 in the third match, at an average of 46. Up until this tour, Cook had held a strange record of having more Test centuries than half centuries but this century marked his last until March 2009 and Cook came under increasing criticism for his lack of ability to convert fifties to hundreds at the top of the order, yet maintained an average in the low forties.\n\nEngland's tour of the antipodes continued with the tour of New Zealand and Cook made a great start in the warm up matches, making a half century followed by an unbeaten 138 the following day in limited overs matches. His style was still considered too slow for the following two Twenty20 Internationals and he failed to continue his form in the first ODI where he fell for 11 as part of an England collapse. The second match saw a similar collapse by England where Cook's 52 was the only real contribution until he was run out by fellow Essexian Ravi Bopara. The fourth one day match saw Cook and Phil Mustard prop up the innings with an opening stand of 158 before both being dismissed in successive balls, leading to a tied match.\n\nAlthough normally known for his slow but focussed repose with the bat, the first Test against New Zealand gave Cook a chance making three sharp catches in the first innings and mirroring his efforts with three even more spectacular catches in the second innings, the first two off Ryan Sidebottom who then went on to make a hat-trick with a final LBW, the match itself saw England collapse in the second innings for 110 with Cook being the only other player besides Ian Bell to make it into double figures. Incidentally, Cook's other catch in the second innings was also off Sidebottom to dismiss New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori, a feat the pair reproduced in the second innings of the second Test and again in the first innings of the third Test. His batting meanwhile began its long road of decline scoring no more than sixty in the two Tests and falling for only two runs in the final match, though in the second Test he did secure another English record being the youngest Englishman at just over 23 years, to score 2,000 Test runs – again eclipsing Gower; two days later he recorded his first Test six after 2047 runs, including 233 boundaries, after an accidental top edge and ruined his chances of beating Vijay Manjrekar's 2,308 record.\n\nBack home in England Cook failed to reproduce his legacy of Lord's centuries. Scoring 61 in the only England innings of the first Test which was his only score over fifty from the four innings in England's successful series.\nHis poor form in the long format led to him being omitted for the Twenty20 series and all but the final one-day match.\nWith a year to go before the 2009 Ashes, it was imperative for Cook to cement his position as opener in the home series against South Africa. Again, at Lord's, Cook made his way comfortably to a half-century before being dismissed for 60. A high team score, together with a benevolent wicket, saw the fifth day bring Cook's first Test over as a bowler: he conceded just one run. Cook fell in one innings of each Test between fifty and a hundred, amassing the considerable average of 47 for the series.\n\nOnce again Cook found himself omitted from the Twenty20 and one-day team both for the home series against South Africa as well as the majority of the away series in India, where a string of poor England performances saw him called up for the fifth and ultimately the final match after the terrorist attacks in Mumbai. When the Tests arrived, Cook continued to notch a half-century in one innings of each match, but was outshone by opening partner Strauss's centuries.\n\nAfter India, England toured the West Indies under the new captaincy of Andrew Strauss after Pietersen's brief tenure ended in controversy. Cook was shown still to have the selectors' confidence despite his lack of centuries when he was given the unofficial vice-captaincy before the tour began. The title gave him a boost: he went on to score two fifties in the first warm-up match, retiring out in the second innings but contrasted that with a duck in the next tour match. Similarly, in the First Test he scored four and another duck. After the third Test was abandoned due to the poor quality of the surface, Cook was again beleaguered by his perennial problem: he scored two half centuries against opening partner Strauss's 169. He seemed to have put it behind him in the first innings of the next Test, however, as he and Strauss put on a record opening stand of 229. Strauss was bowled first for 169 as Cook reached the nineties but fell shortly thereafter for 94. After two days' batting on a benign pitch, the West Indies declared on 749 for nine in response to England's 600 for six. Put back in with one day to spare, Strauss fell for 33, but, after 38 innings' and fifteen months' waiting, Cook finally arrived at his eighth Test century, and went on to pass his highest score with an unbeaten 139 before play ended in a draw. During this innings, Cook also became the youngest Englishman to pass 3,000 Test runs.\n\nEngland returned home, only to face the West Indies once more. The Second Test took the sides to the Riverside in Durham where, on a benign surface, Cook battled through the first day. After Strauss fell in the morning session, Cook began a partnership with Ravi Bopara, who had recently been promoted to third in the batting order. Over the first day, the two navigated a slow partnership, both strike rates remaining under 55, but, once Cook reached his ninth Test century, Bopara matched it with his own, culminating in a 213-run partnership at Bopara's fall in the closing overs of the day; Cook ended unbeaten on 126. After the second day of play was completely washed out, Cook recorded his first Test 150 and subsequently his then highest score of 160.\n\nOmitted from the World Twenty20 competition, Cook returned to Essex for two moderate county matches but impressive Twenty20 games. Despite being the only Englishman to score a century, or even more than 50, in the first innings of England's warm up match against Warwickshire, in the first Ashes Test at Cardiff, Cook was the lowest scoring recognised batsman, scoring 10 and 6 – caught in the gully in the first innings, and trapped LBW by Mitchell Johnson in the second. Cook bounced back in the second Test at Lord's, batting through to the afternoon session, as he and his captain Andrew Strauss (who scored 161) set the record for the highest opening English partnership at Lord's with 196, Cook initially scored faster than Strauss but fell short of another Lord's century, trapped again by Johnson for 95. This partnership, along with Strauss' anchoring throughout the innings, led England to a total of 425 and enabled them to gain a 210-run first-innings lead, aided by three catches from Cook off James Anderson and Stuart Broad. Batting quickly in the second innings to force victory, Cook scored 32 from 54 balls before again falling LBW but providing enough for England to cement their first victory over Australia at Lord's since 1934 and second since 1896.\n\nAfter this high, the series took a severe downturn for Cook as his only appearance in the third Test was a duck. With no second innings to redeem himself, pressure began to mount on Cook for the fourth Test at Headingley where he anchored himself through half the team before being dismissed half-way through the first innings for only 30, a score which would only be topped by wicket-keeper Matt Prior as England collapsed to Australia's seam attack, bowled out for 102. Though the team batted better in the second innings Cook again was the fifth man out for another 30 as England succumbed to an innings defeat, with Australia levelling the series needing only to draw at the Oval to retain the Ashes. During the fortnight break Cook was among a quintet of players released into the County Championship to increase their form alongside. In the first-class match against Middlesex both he and Bopara failed in the first innings, with scores of 4 and 1, but Cook top scored in the second innings with 64 to push Essex towards victory. Of the five released, Cook was among three picked for the final and decisive Oval Test and didn't start well being dismissed with only 12 runs on the board, ten of them his. However, in the field Cook was part of Australia's first innings collapse, taking two catches off Graeme Swann to dismiss the top scoring opener Simon Katich and the penultimate wicket of Stuart Clark. Working with a 172 run lead on the second evening, Strauss and Cook's steady partnership was ended prematurely with Cook dismissed for 9 in his final innings of the series. Despite this Cook ended the series on something of a high in his fielding position at short leg, taking a catch off Steve Harmison's second wicket in two balls for the penultimate wicket and then taking the winning catch of a leading edge from the defiant Michael Hussey for 121 off Swann to seal the Ashes victory.\n\nCook made his return to international Twenty20 cricket during the tour of South Africa in 2009–10. After scoring 11 runs in the first match, Cook was handed the captaincy after Paul Collingwood picked up an injury prior to the second match but led them to an 84 run loss after posting only 26. In the second Test he scored a patient 118 after being saved by a third umpire referral at 64. This, along with a century from Ian Bell, gave England their only Test win of the drawn series with an innings margin. Despite a meagre performance in the rest of the series, it was quickly announced that England's 2010 tour against Bangladesh would see Strauss rested, with Cook taking on the captaincy role in the Test and One-Day teams as, what national selector Geoff Miller, \"an audition for future engagements\".\n\nIn his first Test as captain in Chittagong, Cook led the team to a win, despite a strong rearguard from Bangladesh, with the top score in both innings. Scoring a century in the first, in the second innings he accumulated 4,000 Test which coincided with teammate Collingwood achieving the same. At 25 years, 79 days Cook became the youngest Englishman to reach this amount and the second youngest worldwide after Indian veteran Sachin Tendulkar who was 24 years, 224 days old. In the second Test, Cook scored the winning runs in a nine wicket win, having scored another century. By virtue of being captain, Cook returned to England's ODI squad for the first time since 2008 and led the team as an opening batsmen to a three win whitewash with respectable scores.\n\nAfter England's successful tour of Bangladesh, Bangladesh came to tour England with Strauss returning as captain and Cook being omitted once more for the short format. Cook was unable to reproduce the good from he showed as captain, making scores of seven and 23 in the first Test before being dismissed for 29 in the second Test between the two sides.\n\nLater in the summer Pakistan toured England also. In the first Test Cook was unimpressive, making scores of 8 and twelve, although England went on to win the match by 354 runs. Cook's form did not improve in the next match where he made scores of 17 and four. It took until the fifth Test of the summer and the third Test against Pakistan for Cook to pass 50, scoring 110 in a losing cause against Pakistan. Before then, he had come in for much scrutiny, especially regarding his technique outside off-stump, and many considered his place to be under-threat. His timely century secured his place for the last Test, although he only scored 10 in an innings win by England, further putting his place into question heading into the winter tour of Australia.\nAlthough there were still concerns about Cook's form and technique ahead of the 2010-11 Ashes series, Cook answered his critics in the best way possible. Following a century in one of the warm-up games, Cook opened his series account with 67 as England won the toss and batted at the Gabba in Brisbane. After surrendering a first-innings deficit of 221, Cook fought back with fellow-opener Strauss and Jonathan Trott. Strauss scored 110 as England scored 188 for the first wicket. With this partnership, Cook and Strauss became England's highest scoring opening partners across their four years together, beating an eighty-year-old record set by Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe; albeit taking 44 more innings to do so. Cook was joined by Trott and they scored an unbeaten partnership of 329; Cook recorded his first double-century in first-class cricket, finishing on 235 not out, and Trott scored 135 not out before England declared on 517–1. Cook's 235* overtook Don Bradman's record score at the ground and several other records were set in that innings.\n\nIn the second Test at Adelaide, Cook scored another century, his 15th, which saw him match Bradman in scoring 15 centuries before his 26th birthday. Cook broke Wally Hammond's record of runs scored without being out and Nasser Hussain's record of most minutes at the crease without being out, before being caught behind off an inside edge for 148 after over 1,000 minutes of being at the crease.\n\nCook, along with his teammates in a losing effort, performed poorly in the third Test but contributed to an innings victory in the fourth, becoming the series' leading run scorer after scoring 82. In the fifth and final Test, Cook twice survived being given out by debutant Michael Beer, the first from a no ball and the second (at 99 runs) after the third umpire confirmed the onfield decision that the ball had not carried. Eventually caught by Michael Hussey, his score of 189 saw him reach 5,000 Test runs in his career while in the series alone he amounted over 36 hours at the crease, a world record in a five Test series and an English record even including six Test series, as well as scoring 766 runs to become England's second highest series scorer behind 906 by Wally Hammond 80 years previous. At the end of the final Test, Cook was presented with both the Man of the Match and Man of the Series awards.\n\nFollowing England's quarter-final departure from the 2011 World Cup, Andrew Strauss resigned the ODI captaincy and Cook was named his successor, despite not having featured in an ODI since leading the side in Bangladesh. In addition to Cook's promotion, seam bowler Stuart Broad was named captain of the Twenty20 side and England went into the home series with Sri Lanka with different captains for each format of the game.\n\nIn the Test series against Sri Lanka Cook made 133 in the first Test of the series to help England take a 1–0 lead. His good form continues into the next match where he made scores of 96 and 106. In the final match of the series Cook made 55 in his only innings of the match, meaning he had scored two centuries and two half centuries in his four innings. Cook's first game as full-time captain against Sri Lanka at the Oval saw England victorious by 110 runs. England went on to win the series 3–2, with Cook top scoring for England in the series with 298 runs in five matches. This performance also led to an ODI player of the series award.\n\nCook was expected to be a key player when England met India, with the series winners taking over the world number one spot. Although Cook failed to make a significant score in the first game, England won the match to go 1–0 up. Cook only scored seven runs in the entire match in the next game, although England again won to go 2–0 up. In the third match of the series Cook hit a brilliant 294 to help England win the game by an innings and clinch the World's number one spot. In the final match of the series he made 34 as England won the series 4–0. In the second ODI Cook made an unbeaten 80 to help guide England to victory. After making scores of 23 and 12 in the next two matches, Cook finished off the series in good form, making 50 in the final game as England won by six wickets.\n\nFor his performances in 2011, he was named in the World Test XI by the ICC and Cricinfo.\n\nEngland then travelled to India for a limited overs series overseas. Cook scored 60 in the first match but England lost by 126 runs. He scored just 13 runs in the next three games, which included being dismissed for a duck. In the final match of the series he returned to form, making 60. However, England again lost and suffered a 5–0 series defeat.\n\nIn the winter of 2012, England struggled in Test matches in the sub continent. They were beaten by Pakistan in the first match of the series, with Cook being dismissed for single figures in both innings. He made 94 in the next game, the only time he passed 50 in the tour, but it was not enough to prevent England losing the match and going 2–0 down. Cook was out cheaply in the first innings as England were again bowled out for less than 200, and although he made 49 in the next innings it wasn't enough to prevent another England defeat.\n\nIn the first Test against Sri Lanka England's form showed no sign of improving and they lost the first match of the series, with Cook being dismissed for a duck in the first innings. With the pressure on England going into the final match of the two Test series, Cook returned to his best, making 94 in the first innings before hitting an unbeaten 49 to help England level the series at 1–1.\n\nBack at home against the West Indies, Cook continued to perform well, hitting a half century in the first match of the series. England went on to win the match by five wickets. They also won the next match of the series, with Cook performing well and making an unbeaten 43 in England's second innings to help guide them to victory. The final match of the series ended in a draw. After being dismissed for a duck in the first ODI, Cook made a superb 112 in the second to help England win the match by 8 wickets.\n\nEngland struggled in the three match series against South Africa, eventually losing the series 2–0. Cook started the series well, making yet another century in the first innings of the first match between the two sides. However, he was dismissed for a duck in the second innings as South Africa took a 1–0 lead. The next match ended in a draw, with Cook making decent contributions, despite failing to pass fifty. The third match was over shadowed when Kevin Pietersen was dropped following an argument with senior England players. Cook scored just ten runs in the match as England lost to lose the series 2–0 and lose their spot at the top of the Test rankings. Cook had an unsuccessful ODI series, the only 50 he made coming in the final match of the series. England lost the match and series finished 2–2.\nOn 29 August 2012, Cook became England's Test captain after previous Test captain Andrew Strauss retired from all forms of cricket.\n\nCook, who captained England in Bangladesh for two Tests in a previous series, took charge of England for the Test series against India in the winter of 2012. In each of the first three Tests – the first a defeat and the second a ten-wicket victory – he scored a century. This, together with a century in each of the aforementioned two Tests in Bangladesh, gave Cook five centuries in five Tests as captain, a record number. His scores on the tour also included 119 and 97 in the warm-up matches. The ten-wicket victory in the second Test was lauded by the media as one of England's greatest victories, and Cook's run of hundreds brought him level with the English Test record for most centuries. On 6 December 2012, Cook became England's leading scorer of centuries after making a hundred against India in Kolkata.\n\nOn 7 December 2012 he captained England to its first Test series victory on Indian soil since 1984–85, as well as overtaking Mike Gatting as England's highest ever run scorer in India For his performances in 2012, he was named both in the World Test XI and ODI XI by the ICC\n. He was also named in the World Test XI by the Cricinfo.\n\nCook continued his impressive form in the ODI series, scoring 75 in the first match, which helped England win the game. Cook was less impressive in the next two games as India took a lead in the series after winning both games. Cook made 74 in the fourth game but England still lost and India took an unassailable 3–1 series lead. England won the last game meaning the series had finished 3–2 to India, meaning the tour was seen as a success and the transition from Strauss to Cook was seen as a smooth one.\n\nAfter the tour of India, Cook led England in New Zealand. In the second ODI, Cook hit 78 to guide England to victory and level the series 1–1. England clinched the series by winning the decider, in which Cook made 46 to secure the series for England. In the first Test match, Cook made a century to help England battle to a draw after a poor showing in the first innings. Cook was not at his best in the final two games of the two, although the nature of the wickets meant that the batsmen found it easy to score runs, and so the series ended 0–0. Despite the pitches, many had expected England to win the series and the draw was seen as a disappointment.\n\nCook led England in the 2013 Champions trophy, and they won their first game against Australia. It was also Cook's first game as captain against Australia. Cook made 59 against Sri Lanka, but England lost the game meaning they were not assured of their place in the next round. Cook top scored with 64 as England narrowly beat New Zealand to book their place in the semi final. After beating South Africa in the semi finals, England played India in the final in what turned out to be a rain affected match. Despite restricting India to 129 in 20 overs, England lost the match by 5 runs, leaving them as runners up. Cook was named as part of the 'Team of the Tournament' by Cricinfo.\n\nIn the first Test against New Zealand on home soil, Cook got made good starts in both innings but was unable to convert these scores past fifty. Despite this England won the Test match. In the second match, Cook returned to form, making 130 and leading England to a 2–0 series win. This meant that England remained undefeated in Test series under Cook, winning two and drawing one. Cook played in the ODI series, despite calls for him to be rested ahead of the Ashes. He made scores of 30, 34 and 0 in the three match series, with England losing 2–1.\n\nThe 2013 home Ashes series marked Cook's first Ashes series as captain. England went into the series as strong favourites, with Australia recently having parted company with their coach. England won the first Test, with Cook making 50 in England's second innings to help them set Australia a competitive target to win the game. They were bowled out for 296, meaning England won the match by 14 runs. Although Cook only managed 20 runs in the next match, England cruised to victory, winning by 347 runs. The third match ended in a draw, with Cook scoring 62 in the first innings, but being dismissed for a duck in the second. The fourth Test saw England win the series after winning the match and taking a 3–0 series lead. The final match ended in a draw, with Cook failing to pass fifty in either of his innings. Despite this, Cook was generally praised for the way he had led the side. In the ODI series, Cook and Flower decided to rest several of England's Test players to ensure they were fit for the series in Australia. Cook himself played no part in the series, being replaced in the side by Michael Carberry.\n\nEngland and Cook suffered a complete whitewash when they travelled to Australia for the 2013–14 Ashes series. They were heavily defeated in the first Test, losing by 381 runs. Cook top-scored in England's second innings with 65 but it wasn't enough as England slumped to defeat. The second match saw a similar humiliation as England lost by 218 runs. England surrendered the urn after losing the third Test, giving Australia a 3–0 series lead. Cook made 72 in the first innings but was dismissed for a duck in the second as England lost their third straight match by over 100 runs. The fourth Test saw Cook make another 50, but it wasn't enough to prevent another heavy defeat. England lost the final match and the series 5–0, with questions being asked of Cook's captaincy. Cook captained England in the ODI series but was unable to make a big contribution as England went 2–0 down. Cook scored 35 in the third match as England finally won their first game of the tour. However, they went on to lose the series 4–1. Upon returning from Australia, Andy Flower resigned but Cook vowed to continue as captain and was later backed by the ECB to help to mould a new England team.\n\nFor his performances in 2013, he was named as captain of the World Test XI by the ICC.\n\nCook continued in his role as captain for the home series against Sri Lanka. In the first ODI of the series he made just 11 runs. He followed this up with an unbeaten 30 in the third match and guided England to a ten wicket victory. He was out for just one in the next match as Sri Lanka levelled the series at 2–2. In the deciding match Cook made 56, his first half century of the summer, although it was not enough to prevent England losing the series 3–2. Cook continued to struggle for form in the Test series against Sri Lanka, scoring 17 and 28 as England drew the game. Cook was also criticised for not declaring earlier and not giving his bowlers enough time to win the game. England lost the next match, with Cook again failing to pass fifty in either innings, with his high score in the match being 33 in the second innings.\n\nCook went into the Test series against India under pressure following the defeat to Sri Lanka. In the first Test he scored just five runs. However, as the match edged towards a draw, he collected his maiden Test wicket of Ishant Sharma when he was bowling medium pace. Cook's poor form continued in the second Test when he made scores of 10 and 22 as England lost the game to go 1–0 down in the series. On 27 July, in the third Test against India at the Rose Bowl, Cook scored 95 in the first innings which showed that he was getting back in form with confidence before getting out to Ravindra Jadeja. He then went on to score 70 not out in second innings before declaring as England won the match to level the series. Although he only made 17 in the next match, his captaincy was praised as England won the game by an innings to take a 2–1 series lead. Cook made 79 in the final match of the series, which England again won to seal the series 3–1. Following the win, Cook revealed he had considered his position as captain but was convinced by his wife to continue. After the first match of the ODI series was rained off, Cook made 19 in the second ODI as England suffered a defeat. They went 2–0 down in the series after losing the next game, although Cook batted well, making 44. He made just 9 in the next match as India clinched the series 3–0. Following the defeat questions were asked over Cook's role in the ODI team. However, the team bounced back to win the final game of the series in convincing fashion, with Cook making 46.\n\nCook captained England for the ODI tour of Sri Lanka. However, he did not perform well in the first two matches, making scores of 10 and 22 as England lost both games. England won the third match, with Cook making 34, although he was later banned for the next game due to a slow over rate. In the fifth match he scored 20, as England won to keep the series alive. However, they lost the last two games, with Cook making scores of 1 and 32. The 5–2 series defeat lead to questions over Cook's leadership of the team.\n\nOn 19 December 2014, Cook was removed as one-day captain, and replaced by Eoin Morgan. This was primarily due to his poor form in ODI cricket.\n\nCook continued his captaincy of the Test team, having not scored a century since May 2013. In the first Test of the three-Test series, Cook registered scores of only 11 and 13, in an otherwise strong performance from England. The match finished in a draw. Cook took advantage of favourable batting conditions in the following Test, making 76 in an opening partnership of 125 in England's first innings with Jonathan Trott. It was England's first century opening partnership since March 2013, and Cook's innings took him past Alec Stewart to become England's second-highest run-scorer in Tests. In the second innings, Cook made 59* in a comfortable run chase to win the Test by nine wickets and help England to secure 1–0 lead in the three match series. In the third Test in Barbados, Cook scored 105 in England's first innings, his first Test century in almost two years. However he made only 4 in the second innings, as England slumped to 123 all out. West Indies comfortably chased the runs they needed to gain a victory, making the final result for the series 1–1.\n\nThe English team then welcomed the Black Caps in May, with the first Test of the two-match series at Lord's. In the first Test, Cook continued his resurgence with his 27th century in Tests, scoring 162 in the second innings as England ultimately made 478 all out. England went on to win the game by 124 runs to go 1–0 up in the series. Cook continued his good form in the second Test. He made 75 in England's first innings as they posted 350 to equal New Zealand's first innings score. New Zealand were able to build up a big lead in their second innings, and although Cook made 56 in the final innings in the match, England lost the match by 199 runs and the series finished tied at 1–1. During the second Test, he became England's leading run scorer in Test matches, as well as the first England player to score 9,000 runs in Tests and the first to score 1,000 Test runs against five different nations.\n\nCook captained England in the 2015 Ashes series, and although England won the first game, Cook could only manage scores of 20 in the first innings and 12 in the second. England lost the second Test by 405 runs, but Cook was one of the few England batsman to show any resistance, scoring 96 in England's first innings. With the series level Cook made 34 in England's first innings of the third Test and England went on to win the game by eight wickets. England won the fourth Test by an innings and 78 runs, meaning Cook only needed to bat once, scoring 43 in England's first innings. With the Ashes won, Cook was praised for his captaincy and he gave an emotional interview following the victory. England lost the final match of the series, but Cook was again one of few England batsmen to show any resistance with the bat as he scored 85 in their second innings. Despite the loss, England won the series 3–2 and Cook celebrated his second Ashes win as captain.\n\nCook scored his third double-century and 28th Test ton (263) against Pakistan in first Test at Abu Dhabi in October 2015 in 836 minutes: the longest innings by an Englishman and 3rd longest of all time, facing 528 balls. In doing so he also became the all-time highest non-Asian run scorer in Asia, overtaking Jacques Kallis' 2,039 runs. Despite Cook's brilliant innings, England were unable to force a victory, running out of time after bad light stopped play. In the second Test Cook scored 65 in the first innings as England posted 242. With England chasing down a big target to win in the second innings, Cook could only manage 10 and Pakistan won the match by 127 runs. England need to win the third Test to have any chance of drawing the series and despite taking a first innings lead which Cook contributed 49 to, Pakistan batted well in the second innings and England were dismissed for 256 in their second innings, meaning the lost the series 2–0, despite Cook scoring 63.\n\nFor his performances in 2015, he was named as captain of the World Test XI by the ICC. He was also named in the Test XI by ESPNCricinfo and Cricbuzz.\n\nIn the Test series against South Africa, Cook made a duck in the first innings of the first Test, but England recovered to post 303. England went on to win the game by 241 runs thanks to a strong bowling performance. In the second Test Cook again failed to make a major impression, scoring just 35 runs in the entire match in what proved to be a high scoring draw. Cook started to show some form in the third Test. He scored 43 in England's second innings total of 74–3, as England won the game by seven wickets after dismissing South Africa for just 83 in their second innings. In the final Test of the series, which England had already won, Cook made 76 in the first innings. However, England collapsed in the second innings and only made 101, with Cook being dismissed for five. Despite this, England won the series 2–1 with Cook captaining England to the historic victory.\n\nIn the first Test against Sri Lanka, Cook could only make 16 but England went on to win the match by an innings and 88 runs. In the second Test, left handed batsman created history on 30 May 2016 in the second Test against Sri Lanka to become the youngest batsman to score 10000 Test runs beating Sachin Tendulkar's 11-year-old record. The 31-year-old broke the record on the fourth day of the second Test match against Sri Lanka at Chester Le Street. He became the 12th international cricketer to reach the landmark and the first Englishman. He scored 47 in England's second innings to help England to a convincing nine wicket victory. In the first innings of the third Test, he scored 85 to help England to 416. He came in down the order for England's second innings after being injured in the field and made an unbeaten 49. Rain on the final day meant the match finished in a draw, with England winning the series 2–0.\n\nCook broke India great Sunil Gavaskar’s record of 9,607 for the most runs as a Test opener while making 81 against Pakistan in the first Test at Lord's. However, Cook could only make eight in the second innings and England lost the opening Test by 75 runs. On 22 July 2016, Alastair Cook equalled Don Bradman's record of having hit 29 Test centuries when he scored 105 on the opening day of the 2nd Test against Pakistan at Old Trafford. He chose not to enforce the follow-on when England were far ahead in the second Test – but was vindicated by an England victory, with Cook scoring an unbeaten 76 in England's second innings. In the third Test he made scores of 45 and 66 and England won by 141 runs to go 2–1 up in the series. However, England lost the final match, with Cook scoring 35 in the first innings before making seven in the second innings as England lost by 10 wickets and the series ended in a 2–2 tie.\n\nIn the first Test against Bangladesh, Cook scored 4 in the first innings and then made 12 in the second. Despite his low scores, England won by 21 runs. In the second Test Cook made 14 in the first innings, and although he made 59 in the second, England were bowled out for 164 to lose the match by 108 runs and draw the series 1–1.\n\nIn the first Test against India Cook made 21 in the first innings before making 130 in England's second innings total of 260/3, although England were unable to force a victory, with the match ending in a draw. In the second Test he made 2 in the first innings, before going on to score 54 in England's second innings total of 158, as England lost by 246 runs. In the third Test, Cook made 27 in the first innings before making 12 in the second innings, as England lost the match by eight wickets.

In the final Test, Cook made 10 in the first innings as England scored 477, but India gained a first innings lead after scoring 759/7. Cook made 49 in England's second innings as they were dismissed for 207 to lose by an innings and 75 runs. A month and half after the end of the series, Cook stood down as Test captain, having captained the team in an English record of 59 Tests.\n\nFor his performances in 2016, he was named as captain of the World Test XI by the ICC.\n\nThe first Test at Lord's was Cook's first under the new captain, Joe Root. Cook didn't score a century in the series but was reliable with three 50s. England won the 4 Test series 3–1 with the only loss at Trent Bridge. Cook's top scored in the second innings there with 42, with no other England batsmen offering much resistance.\n\nCook's form slump that had continued through the 2017-18 Ashes, where he had not scored a half-century in 10 innings, finally came to an end with 104* from 166 balls by the end of day two of the Boxing Day Ashes Test in Melbourne. He went on to carry his bat with a double century and put England into a lead of over 100, finishing with 244 not out, the highest Test score by an opener who has carried the bat. In December 2018 this record was bettered by New Zealand's Tom Latham, in his score of 264* vs Sri Lanka.\n\nAfter a score of 70 of the first match of the home series against Pakistan, Cook had another slump in form, scoring a total of 155 more runs in 5 further matches Pakistan and India.\nOn 3 September 2018, after the conclusion of the fourth Test, Cook announced that his twelve-year international career would end at the conclusion of the series against India. On the fourth day of the fifth Test (after resuming on an overnight score of 46*), Cook made a score of 147 and in doing so became the fifth batsman to score a century in his first and last Test match and the second batsman to score twin fifties in his first and last Test. When he reached 76 during the innings, he overtook Kumar Sangakkara to become the fifth highest run scorer and the highest scoring left-hander in Test history.\n\nCook has written a column in \"The Daily Telegraph\" and \"Metro\". He used his skill with the saxophone to contribute to Freefonix, a CBBC animated series with music-based adventures.

He returned to Portugal and received professional coaching at SC Farense. Vaz Tê played youth football with his local club Real Massamá, a team which also included Manchester United winger Nani. Nani went to play for Sporting CP while Vaz Tê left for England to play for Bolton Wanderers. They also represented the Portugal Under-21s.\n\nVaz Tê went on trial with Bolton Wanderers in 2003 and he was signed on a three-year youth academy contract. He made such an impression at youth level that Vaz Tê quickly found himself part of the Bolton first-team squad. He made his debut in their FA Cup tie with Tranmere Rovers in January 2004. Just over two months later, he made his Premier League debut in a 2–0 defeat at Middlesbrough. He made his first full start in the game with Manchester United at Old Trafford in December 2004.\n\nIn 2005–06, Vaz Tê was again involved in first-team action, starting 7 games and coming on as a substitute in another 22. He scored 6 goals in all competitions, one of which a late equaliser shortly after coming on as a substitute on 24 November 2005, at Vitória de Guimarães. In March 2007, Vaz Tê joined Hull City on a month's loan from Bolton.\n\nHe had an unlucky beginning to the 2007–08 season, damaging his ligaments on the opening day. He only appeared in one more game throughout that season, a 0–1 defeat to Sporting Lisbon in the UEFA Cup in which Bolton Manager Gary Megson played mostly a reserve team. In August 2008, there was confusion regarding the player, when it was widely reported that he had signed for Racing de Santander on loan as part of a swap deal that would see fellow striker Euzebiusz Smolarek go the other way. However, although Smolarek did join Bolton, the Portuguese striker also remained at the club. He made only two appearances in the 2008–09 season and none in the 2009–10 season, as he required four operations on his right knee and one on his left knee. On 11 May 2010, Vaz Tê was released by Bolton Wanderers.\n\nOn 30 June 2010 it was reported that Vaz Tê had signed a three-year deal with Greek Super League club Panionios. In December 2010, after less than six months in Greece, it was announced that Vaz Tê and Panionios had come to an agreement to mutually terminate his contract. Panionios had suffered financial problems, which meant that Vaz Tê went four months without receiving any pay.\n\nVaz Tê went on trial with Scottish Premier League club Hibernian in February 2011 and manager Colin Calderwood stated that both parties were in discussions about a contract. The signing was confirmed on 28 February. Vaz Tê made his debut for the club in a 1–1 draw against St Johnstone on 5 March as a substitute. He scored one goal for Hibs, in an Edinburgh derby against Hearts. His contract was not renewed at the end of the season. Vaz Tê later said that he had played for Hibs for \"no money\", but had chosen to go there due to the \"visibility\" of Scottish football in neighbouring England.\n\nVaz Tê went on trial with Football League Championship club Barnsley in July 2011, every other Championship club having rejected that opportunity. He impressed the club management and scored a goal in a friendly against Grimsby Town. On 3 August 2011 he agreed a contract with Barnsley until the end of the 2011–12 season. He scored his first goal for Barnsley in a 2–0 win against Burnley on 18 October 2011. Vaz Tê scored his fifth Barnsley goal on 6 December 2011 against Crystal Palace after only 8.5 seconds, the fastest goal in Barnsley history. He scored again later in the game to give Barnsley a 2–1 win. On 31 December, Vaz Tê scored a hat-trick in a 4–1 win against Leeds United, after coming on as a substitute. \"Sky Sports\" reported on 1 January 2012 that Vaz Tê had rejected Barnsley's offer of a new contract. He scored both of the Barnsley goals in a 4–2 defeat against Swansea City in an FA Cup third round tie.\n\nVaz Tê signed for then Championship club West Ham United on 31 January 2012, for an undisclosed fee on a -year deal with an option for a third year. Vaz Tê made his debut for the club, coming on as an 89th-minute substitute for Carlton Cole in the London derby against Millwall on 4 February. The game finished 2–1 to West Ham United. On 21 February 2012, Vaz Tê scored his first goal for the Hammers, in a 4–1 victory at Blackpool. Nicky Maynard and Gary O'Neil also scored their first professional goals for the club. Vaz Tê scored his first hat-trick for West Ham on 14 April 2012, in West Ham United's 6–0 home victory against Brighton & Hove Albion. West Ham finished 3rd behind Southampton entering the play-offs against Cardiff City. They won the first leg at the Cardiff City Stadium 2–0 and the second leg 3–0 at the Upton Park, with Vaz Tê scoring the second goal of the second game. West Ham progressed to the play-off final with a 5–0 aggregate victory. In the play-off final at Wembley on 19 May 2012, Vaz Tê scored the winning goal in the 87th minute. It was the 24th goal Vaz Tê had scored in the 2011–12 season.\n\nHe was in the starting line-up from the beginning of the 2012–13 season scoring his first Premier League goal for West Ham in their 2–1 away win at QPR on 1 October 2012. In the very next game, on 6 October 2012 at home to Arsenal, Vaz Tê dislocated his shoulder, an injury which kept him out of the team for nearly 3 months. Vaz Tê returned to the side on 29 December in an away game at Reading, he was brought on with 23 minutes remaining and his side down 1–0 and went on to miss a glaring opportunity to draw the match, as West Ham lost. Sam Allardyce said it was one of the greatest ever chances to score in the Premier League and the Portuguese striker agreed, and apologised to the Hammers fans.\n\nHe started the 2013–14 season as a 90th-minute substitute, replacing Joe Cole, in a 2–0 home win against Cardiff City. He scored his first goal of the season in a League Cup second round fixture against Cheltenham Town on 27 August 2013, when he scored the opening goal from a free-kick in 42nd minute of the match, which ended a 2–1 win for West Ham. He later received a \"Goal of the Month\" club award for that goal.\nAfter the Cheltenham win, on 28 August 2013, Vaz Tê handed in a transfer request. His statement regarding this said, \"The statistics are evident to all but, despite this, it has been made obvious to myself and my representatives that I am not in the manager's plans. Therefore, it is with a heavy heart that I submit a transfer request and look to join a club where my approach to the game will be appreciated.\" He has remained at West Ham for at least until the winter transfer period and has committed himself to the club. Following his transfer request Vaz Te played four games in September 2013, scoring once and three games in October scoring twice, in games against Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City. These proved to be his last goals for the club. In his next game, on 27 October 2013, he dislocated his shoulder against Swansea City. He did not return to the first team until 15 April 2014 when he played 12 minutes against Arsenal in a 1–3 defeat.\n\nIn the 2014–15 season he was rarely picked by manager Sam Allardyce making only four league appearances and one in the League Cup. His last game came on 22 November 2014 in a 2–1 away defeat to Everton and on 17 January 2015, his contract was terminated by the club.\n\nOn 18 January 2015, Vaz Tê joined Turkish Süper Lig side Akhisar Belediyespor on a six-month contract. He played just 14 games; scoring on five occasions.\n\nOn 13 November 2015, Vaz Tê signed for Charlton Athletic on a free transfer until the end of the season. However, he was released from his contract in February 2016.\n\nOn 14 July 2017, Vaz Tê transferred to Chinese Super League side Henan Jianye. Vaz Tê transferred to China League One side Qingdao Huanghai in February 2019. \n\nIn the summer of 2005, Vaz Tê took part in the annual Toulon tournament scoring a hat-trick for Portugal U-20s, in their game with South Korea. He then played regularly for the Portugal under-21 team. Vaz Tê could still play for Guinea-Bissau, as he has not yet been selected by Portugal.\n\nWest Ham United\n\nQingdao Huanghai\n\n"}
{"id": "2156468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156468", "title": "Bone pain", "text": "Bone pain\n\nBone pain (also known medically by several other names) is pain coming from a bone. It occurs as a result of a wide range of diseases and/or physical conditions and may severely impair the quality of life. \n\nBone pain belongs to the class of deep somatic pain, often experienced as a dull pain that cannot be localized accurately by the patient. This is in contrast with the pain which is mediated by superficial receptors in, e.g., the skin. Bone pain can have several possible causes ranging from extensive physical stress to serious diseases such as cancer.\n\nFor many years it has been known that bones are innervated with sensory neurons. Yet their exact anatomy remained obscure due to the contrasting physical properties of bone and neural tissue. More recently, it is becoming clear what types of nerves innervated which sections of bone. The periosteal layer of bone tissue is highly pain-sensitive and an important cause of pain in several disease conditions causing bone pain, like fractures, osteoarthritis, etc. However, in certain diseases the endosteal and haversian nerve supply seems to play an important role, e.g. in osteomalacia, osteonecrosis, and other bone diseases. Thus there are several types of bone pain, each with many potential sources or origins of cause.\n\nA number of diseases can cause bone pain, including the following:\n\n\nCommon causes of bone and joint pain in adults, such as osteoarthritis and gouty arthritis are rare in children, as these diseases are a sequelae of chronic wear and tear for several years.\n\nPain caused by cancer within bones is one of the most serious forms of pain. Because of its severity and uniqueness with respect to other forms of pain, it is extensively researched. According to studies of bone cancer in mouse femur models, it has been determined that bone pain related to cancer occurs as a result of destruction of bone tissue. Chemical changes that occur within the spinal cord as a result of bone destruction give further insight into the mechanism of bone pain.\n\nMetastatic cancer cells often establish themselves within the skeleton. When the cancer cells have metastasized, the mechanical dynamics of the bone matrix become weaker as skeletal strength decreases. This leads to several other complications throughout the body including pain, thus decreasing the patient’s quality of life.\n\nBone tumors are composed of a conglomeration of cell types including cancer and immune system cells. Often tumor cells secrete growth factors which activate receptors close to primary afferent neurons. Activation of these neural receptors is a contributing factor to pain sensation. Additionally, inflammatory lipids called prostaglandins, which are produced at high rates by cancer cells within tumors, activate nociceptors when they bind together.\n\nStimulation of specialized pain-sensitive nerve fibers (nociceptors) that innervate bone tissue leads to the sensation of bone pain. Bone pain originates from both the periosteum and the bone marrow which relay nociceptive signals to the brain creating the sensation of pain. Bone tissue is innervated by both myelinated (A beta and A delta fiber) and unmyelinated (C fiber) sensory neurons. In combination, they can provide an initial burst of pain, initiated by the faster myelinated fibers, followed by a slower and longer-lasting dull pain initiated by unmyelinated fibers.\n\nNociceptors responsible for bone pain can be activated via several mechanisms including deterioration of surrounding tissue, bone destruction, and physical stress which shears the bone, vascular, muscle, and nervous tissue.\n\nThe use of anesthetics within the actual bone has been a common treatment for several years. This method provides a direct approach using analgesics to relieve pain sensations.\n\nAnother commonly used method for treating bone pain is radiotherapy, which can be safely administered in low doses. Radiotherapy utilizes radioactive isotopes and other atomic particles to damage the DNA in cells, thus leading to cell death. By targeting cancer tumors, radiotherapy can lead to decrease in tumor size and even tumor destruction. A form of radiotherapy that is often used in cases of bone cancer is systemic radioisotope therapy, where the radioisotopes target sections of the bone specifically undergoing metastasis. \nIn the case of bone fractures, surgical treatment is generally the most effective. Analgesics can be used in conjunction with surgery to help ease pain of damaged bone.\n\nMouse and other animal models are being heavily used to determine the neuron tissue densities in bone and mechanisms for maintenance of bone pain. This information is pertinent to determining the biological and physiological components of pain in the bone. By creating a detailed map relating the types of nerves going through the different sections of bone, it is possible to pin-point locations in the bone that are at a higher risk of being susceptible to bone pain.\n\nTreatments focusing on biological components such as cannabinoid receptors are being tested for effectiveness. Through testing in mouse models, it has been shown that activation of the CB-1 receptor helps reduce reactions associated with acute pain, indicating that it alleviates bone pain. Thus, a new target for potential treatments is activation of the CB-1 receptor.\n\nModern research and techniques are attempting to provide longer-lasting and more effective methods of treating bone pain by developing and applying new physiological knowledge of nervous tissue within the bone. If thorough understanding of the intra-neuronal mechanisms relating to pain can be developed, then new and more effective treatment options can be created and tested. Thus, it is critical to fully understand the mechanism which dictates bone pain.\n\nBone pain is also known by the following names:\n"}

{"id": "2156477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156477", "title": "Dental papilla", "text": "Dental papilla\n\nIn embryology and prenatal development, the dental papilla is a condensation of ectomesenchymal cells called odontoblasts, seen in histologic sections of a developing tooth. It lies below a cellular aggregation known as the enamel organ. The dental papilla appears after 8–10 weeks intra uteral life. The dental papilla gives rise to the dentin and pulp of a tooth.\n\nThe enamel organ, dental papilla, and dental follicle together forms one unit, called the tooth germ. This is of importance because all the tissues of a tooth and its supporting structures form from these distinct cellular aggregations. Similar to dental follicle, the dental papilla has a very rich blood supply and provides nutrition to the enamel organ.\n\nFormation of dental papilla occurs in the Cap stage of Odontogenesis.\n\nThe cap stage is the second stage of tooth development and occurs during the ninth or tenth week of prenatal development. Unequal proliferation of the tooth bud forms a three-dimensional cap shape. Overlying this cap structure is the ectomesenchyme, which is attached to the mesodermal tissue known as the dental papilla superiorly, and lies within the epithelial concavity.\n\nVarious types of differentiation occur at this stage; such as cytodifferentiation, histodifferentiation and morphodifferentation. Histodifferentiation is the differentiation of different tissue types during the development of an embryo/ undifferentiated group of cells. Furthermore, morphogenesis is a predominant physiological process during the cap stage. This is due to formation of primordium of the tooth. The primordium contains each of the primordial tissue types, essential for the development of successive teeth. These primordial tissues together form the enamel organ, dental papilla and dental sac.\n\nAlso during the cap stage is the formation of a depression within the deepest part of each tooth bud of the dental lamina. The dental lamina is a band of epithelial tissue which connects the developing tooth bud to the oral epithelium. The dental lamina eventually disintegrates into small clusters of epithelium and is reabsorbed. The dental lamina is first evidence of tooth development and begins at the sixth week in utero.\n\nThis is responsible for the cap like structure of the enamel organ. It is important to note that enamel is an ectodermal product as it is originally derived from ectoderm which is the outermost of the three germ layers of the forming embryo. The other two are: the mesoderm and the endoderm. It gives rise to the nervous system, sense organs, outer layer of the skin, teeth and the membrane lining the oral cavity (mouth).\n\nA section of the ectomesenchyme (a group of tissue made up of neurocrest cells which are present in the initial development of an embryo. This forms the hard and soft tissues of the neck and skull), condenses into a mass within the concavity of the cap of the enamel organ. This mass is now considered the dental papilla. Note that dental papilla is originally derived from ectomesenchyme. Ectomesenchyme (type of mesenchyme) is derived from neural crest cells (NCCs). A basement membrane exists between the enamel organ and dental papilla which will be the site of the future dentinoenamel junction. The dentinoenamel junction is the surface at which the enamel and the dentin of the crown of a tooth are joined.\n\nThe existing ectomesenchyme around the outside of the cap of the enamel organ then condenses into the dental sac. A basement membrane separate the enamel organ and the dental sac. The dental sac produces the periodontium in future development. The periodontium is the tissue that surrounds and supports the teeth. It includes the connective tissue and overlying keratinised membrane lining the oral cavity that surrounds the teeth, the periodontal ligament, cementum which provides a protective covering for the root surface and supporting alveolar bone\n\nThis is the fourth stage of tooth development which occurs between the eleventh and twelfth week of prenatal development. During this stage of Odontogenesis, the epithelial tooth germ forms a bell - shaped structure in the labio - lingual section and is characterised by the formation of the dental sac. The peripheral cells of the dental papilla undergo differentiation, growing larger in size and taking a columnar (uni-layered) form and are now referred to as Odontoblasts (the outer part of the dental pulp). This differentiation begins at the apex of the dental papilla, gradually extending downwards. This differentiation occurs to supplement the development of the dental sac which is responsible which is responsible for cementum, periodontal ligament and the alveolar process.\n\n- Inner\n\n\n-Outer\n\n\n-Stratum\n\nIs concerned with:\n\n\nDuring the apposition stage the enamel, dentin and cementum are secreted in successive layers. The mesenchymal tissue of dental papilla and dental sac and the ectodermal tissue of enamel undergo induction. The outer cells of dental papilla are induced by preameloblasts (cells within the enamel from which a cell that takes part in forming dental enamel develops) to differentiate into odontoblasts (dentin-secreting cells). The odontoblasts undergo differentiation and repolarization and result in formation of the dentin matrix/pre-dentin (the innermost section of the dentin, which is not mineralized and located adjacent to pulp tissues in the crown area and root area). The central cells of dental papilla form the primordium of the pulp during root development. These cells then become surrounded by newly formed dentin..\n\nEctomesenchymal cells will multiply continuously in a localized area such that when the bell stage of development is reached, both the epithelial component and the ectomesenchymal component will seem to have been surrounded by something that presents as a fibrous sac. Therefore, among a complicated mass of highly differentiated cells, it would appear to have three major components, which are:\n\n1) \"The Dental Follicle\" → The ectomesenchymal cells which are part of the fibrous sac that have been formed\n\n2) \"The Dental Papilla\" → The ectomesenchymal cells which are lying deep to the enamel organ\n\n3) \"The Enamel Organ\" → purely the epithelial component\n\nThe tissues which have been derived from each of the three components are as followed:\n\n1) \"The Dental Follicle\" → will develop to become the periodontal ligament, the cementum and the alveolar bone\n\n2) \"The Dental Papilla\" → will develop to become the dental pulp and the dentine\n\n3) \"The Enamel Organ\" → will develop to create the enamel solely\n\nIt is important to note that till this point, no dental tissues have been created yet.\n\nWhen all of the individual components of the tooth germ have become developed, the entire cell mass would have appeared to have migrated deeper into the underlying connective tissues. This phenomenon, which will continue throughout the whole life of the teeth, is most possibly due to the cell mass moving towards a rich blood supply that can be found in the deeper parts of the mandible (lower jaw) and the maxilla (upper jaw) The probable need for a rich blood supply would seem to show that the cell mass will soon be highly productive in the formation of dental tissues. Therefore, when the late bell stage of the tooth germ development has been reached, most of the cells would have been differentiated to an apparent endpoint where the cells will now begin their formative role when the first three stages of the tissue development are almost completed, and the tissues can now start to begin secreting.\n\nClusters of blood vessels are found branching out around the tooth germ in the dental follicle and going into the dental papilla during the cap stage. In the dental papilla the number of blood vessels increase and the matrix deposition will begin once the maximum is reached during the bell stage. Blood vessels going into the dental papilla are formed into groups that coincides with the positions of where the roots will develop in future. As time passes, the viability of the tissue is affected as the blood supply becomes steadily reduced in stages and the volume of pulpal tissue starts decreasing too.\n\nDuring the bud to cap stage of tooth development, the pioneer nerve fibers head towards the developing tooth. The nerve fibers will branch out and create a rich plexus around the tooth germ in that structure as the dental follicle is the clear target of these dental nerve fibers. The dental follicle is a fibrous sac that surrounds the odontogenic organ and developing tooth. The plexus is a system of connections of blood vessels, nerves, or lymphatic vessels. The plexus of Raschkow is a network of nerves immediately beneath the odonblast layer of the dentine, first described by J. Raschkow in 1835. However, the nerve fibers will only begin entering the dental papilla (pulp) when Dentinogenesis starts. The timing is not similar to the establishment of the neural supply and the papillary vascular supply even though a feasible relationship has been assumed between the developing nerve and blood supplies. Furthermore, histo-chemistry studies have shown that in the makeup of pioneer nerve fibers heading towards the tooth germ, automatic nerve fibers are not present. Therefore, the starting innervation of the developing teeth is involved with the sensory innovation of the future periodontal ligament and pulp. Nerve fibers never enters the enamel organ.\n\nNerve-related signaling molecules, such as Glial cell line-derived growth factor, Neurotrophin and semaphoring are among the few which have been studied during the tooth development process. Of which, the verve-related signaling molecules seems to show a trend that suggest an early implication of innervation of tooth development. Similar to how many molecules are able to stimulate axonal growth or migration, various molecules are also within the bounds of possibility of being involved in the initial innervation of the tooth germ.\n\nIt is paramount to understand how odontoblast differentiate from ectomesenchymal cells to allow comprehension and explanation of normal development and to be able to affect their recruitment when needed to start repairing the dentin.\n\nGrowth factors in the cells of the inner enamel epithelium and expressions of signaling molecules bring about the differentiation of odontoblast through normal development of the dental papilla. Exhibiting a central nucleus and few organelles, the dental papilla cells are small and undifferentiated. At this stage, the cells are separated by an acellular zone, that consist of some fine collagen fibrils, from the inner enamel epithelium. Changes will also start occurring in the adjacent dental papilla, very quickly after reversed polarity of the cells of the inner enamel epithelium. To contain increasing amounts of protein-synthesizing organelles, odontoblasts as their cytoplasm ( the liquid inside a cell but outside the nucleus) increases in volume after the ectomesenchymal cells beside the acellular zone rapidly enlarge and elongate to become preodontoblasts. When the odontoblasts differentiate and increase in size to occupy the acellular zone between the dental papilla and the inner enamel epithelium, the zone slowly is removed. With their nuclei positioned away from the inner enamel epithelium, these newly differentiated cells are distinguished by being highly polarized.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2156483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156483", "title": "Joseph E. Levine", "text": "Joseph E. Levine\n\nJoseph Edward Levine (September 9, 1905 – July 31, 1987) was an American film producer. At the time of his death it was said he was involved in 497 films as a producer, distributor or financier. These included \"Two Women\", \"Contempt\", \"The 10th Victim\", \"Marriage Italian Style\", \"The Lion in Winter\", \"The Producers\", \"The Graduate,\" \"The Night Porter\", \"A Bridge Too Far\" and \"Carnal Knowledge\". Levine was also responsible for the US releases of \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters!\"; \"Attila\"; and \"Hercules,\" which helped revolutionize US film marketing.\n\nLevine was born in a slum in Boston, Massachusetts, on September 9, 1905. The youngest of six children of a Russian-Jewish immigrant tailor, Joe did whatever work he could to help support his mother, a widow who had remarried only to have her second husband abandon her. This led Joe (in his later years) to tell an interviewer that he had known (in his words) \"not one happy day\" growing up. At 14 years of age he was hired for full-time work in a dress factory and left school, never to re-enroll.\n\nIn the 1920s in partnership with two of his older brothers, Joe opened a basement dress shop, whose stock the Levine brothers obtained on consignment. Nan Robertson's obituary of him for the New York \"Times\" notes that he \"briefly drove an ambulance, manufactured little statues of Daddy Grace, a black evangelist, and operated the Cafe Wonderbar in Boston's Back Bay\" during this period and during the early and middle 1930s.\n\nIn 1937, Levine encountered Rosalie Harrison, then a singer with Rudy Vallee's band, and left the restaurant business for her; within a week of their engagement, at Harrison's insistence, Levine sold the Cafe Wonderbar. They married the following year and moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where Joe bought, and commenced to run, a movie house. Eventually, he became a successful, if small-time, distributor and exhibitor throughout New England, buying \"decrepit\" Westerns at low rates for his movie houses.\n\nOne of Levine's most unusual successes was \"Body Beautiful,\" a sex-hygiene film which he saw drawing a line of prospective ticket-buyers who were braving a snowstorm to that end. He later remembered buying it to show in his theaters because \"it made me sick.\"\n\nThe Second World War led Levine to run an almost jingoistic promotion of the film \"Ravaged Earth,\" which had been shot in China. Renting the Shubert Theater in his native Boston, he spent large sums of his own money on advertisements for the film that he wrote himself; these reflected the anti-Japanese sentiments of the times and used language that would later be considered offensive. Robertson's obituary quotes one of the slogans as reading: \"Jap Rats Stop at Nothing - See This. It Will Make You Fighting Mad.\"\n\nLevine discovered that double features with the same cast members or similar titles brought in higher box-office revenues; this led him to present two films together because they had similar titles. When, in 1956, he bought the Australian film \"Walk Into Paradise,\" its low box-office revenues led him to change the title to \"Walk Into Hell,\" which gave it box-office success.\n\nIn 1956, the year he brought \"Walk Into Paradise\" to the United States under the title \"Walk Into Hell,\" Levine founded Embassy Pictures Corporation, an independent studio and distributor which became responsible for such films as \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters!\" in 1956, \"Attila\" and \"Hercules,\" both in 1958, \"The Carpetbaggers,\" \"Harlow,\" \"The Graduate,\" \"A Bridge Too Far\" and \"The Lion in Winter\".\n\nLevine's Embassy Pictures began dealing in art films, often European ones, in the 1960s. During that decade, he reached the peak of his career and his prestige, which he was able to sustain into the 1970s.\n\nIn 1961, Levine bought North American distribution rights for \"Two Women\" after seeing no more than three minutes of its \"rushes.\" He was not credited as the \"executive producer\" of \"Two Women,\" which was based on a novella written by Alberto Moravia, had been directed by Vittorio de Sica, and starred Sophia Loren and Eleanora Brown, who acted out the respective roles of a mother and her young daughter whom World War II had displaced from their home. One segment of it showed Moroccan soldiers raping the mother and the daughter.\n\nLevine's promotional campaign focused on one still photograph, which showed Loren, as the mother, wearing a torn dress, kneeling in the dirt, and weeping with rage and grief. Predicting that she would win the Academy Award for her performance, Levine brought Loren to the United States for interviews, bought space for, and placed, large advertisements in newspapers, and saw to it that \"Two Women\" appeared in the cities of residence of Academy Award jury members.\n\nLevine's efforts paid off when Loren became the first cast member of a foreign-language film to win the Academy Award for best actress. It came to be said of him that he \"nursed\" \"Two Women\" towards its ultimate popularity and success.\n\nLevine became famous in the industry for his massive advertising campaigns, starting with \"Hercules\" in 1959. He is also responsible for having brought the Japanese film \"Gojira\" to the American general public under the title \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters!\" in 1956. Levine had hired Terry Turner, who had been a former RKO Pictures exploitation expert of the late 1920s and 1930s, where he had exploited \"King Kong\" amongst other films. Levine's and Turner's exploitation campaigns were designed to appeal both to the general public and to the film industry and exhibitors.\n\nIn 1964, Levine received the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in recognition of his lifetime achievement in motion pictures.\n\nLevine sold Embassy to Avco for $40 million. He later called this a \"horrible mistake which made me rich\".\n\nLevine died on July 31, 1987, in Greenwich, Connecticut, at the age of 81. His known survivors, in addition to his widow Rosalie, included his son Richard Levine, who then lived in Greenwich, his daughter Tricia Levine, and two grandchildren, whose names the writer of his August 1 obituary in \"The New York Times,\" Nan Robertson, did not provide.\n\n\"I have a knack for betting on unknown directors and actors and getting my money's worth,\" said Levine.\n\nLevine said his favorite of his films was \"The Lion in Winter\" (1968).\n\n\n\n\n\"\"You can fool all of the people if the advertising is right.\"\"\n\n"}

He currently works for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre in Mexico and has previously worked for AAA in Mexico, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, in the United States and New Japan Pro Wrestling in Japan. Soria is a second-generation professional wrestler; his father, Rubén Soria, was an active wrestler from 1963 to the 1970s.\n\nWorking as Shocker, he has held the CMLL World Tag Team Championship on three occasions, with Negro Casas, Mr. Niebla and L.A. Park. He is also a former holder of the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship, the NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship (twice) and the NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship. He has won the Gran Alternativa tournament in 1995, the Copa de Arena México in 2001, La Copa Junior in 2005 and CMLL Copa Revolución Mexicana in 2011.\n\nHe is talked about in a Netflix movie \"Lucha Mexico\". He appears in the first season of \"An Idiot Abroad\", where Karl Pilkington was sent by show producers Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant to Mexico to see one of the Seven Wonders of the World, Chichen Itza. While he was there, he was tasked with learning how to wrestle. Soria was his trainer.\n\nJosé Luis Jair received his initial professional wrestling training from the highly respected pro wrestling trainer Diablo Velasco as well as his father, Ruben Soria, prior to his in-ring debut. He worked his first match on October 16, 1992, using the ring name Shocker, an \"enmascarado\" or masked wrestler. He later trained under then-Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre lead trainer El Satánico.\n\nShocker began working for CMLL in 1994, and by 1995, he slowly began receiving a push from the promoters when he won the Gran Alterntiva tournament along with his partner, Silver King, in 1995. He capped off the year by defeating veteran Kahoz for his mask in a Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match on December 15. The push continued when he won the NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship, defeating Black Warrior for the championship in 1997.\n\nIn 1998, he began teaming regularly with Mr. Niebla, and together they won the CMLL World Tag Team Championship. The two later had the championship taken away from them when Mr. Niebla suffered a severe injury. In 1999, Shocker's career was further elevated when he turned heel and began storyline feud with Mr. Niebla. The feud culminated in a match at the CMLL 66th Anniversary Show, where Shocker and Mr. Niebla were paired up for a \"Parejas Suicidas\" (\"Suicide Pairs\") match against another pair of feuding partners, Atlantis and Villano III. The rules were that the losing team had to face each other immediately after losing the match in a mask vs. mask match. Shocker and Niebla lost the match and Shocker lost the subsequent \"Lucha de Apuesta\" match, losing his mask as a result.\n\nAfter losing his mask, Shocker was pushed even more, capitalizing on his good looks. He took the nickname \"\"1000% Guapo\"\", or \"1000% Handsome\". He joined up Bestia Salvaje and Scorpio Jr. to form \"Los Guapos\" (\"The Hansome Ones\") in 2000. Shocker later had a falling out with his tag team partners, and he had a heel vs. heel feud along with partners like \"Los Capos\" (Cien Caras, Universo 2000 and Máscara Año 2000) and El Satánico. In 2003, he started a new version of Los Guapos with frequent tag team partner Máscara Mágica and El Terrible and feuded with the original \"Guapos\" members Bestia Salvaje, Scorpio Jr. and Emilio Charles Jr. who were now wrestling as \"Los Talibanes\" (\"the Taliban\").\n\nThe feud peaked with a six-man cage match where El Terrible defeated Bestia Salvaje, forcing him to be shaved bald as a result. By 2004, Shocker was a full-time babyface teaming with L.A. Park and trading the CMLL World Tag Team Championship with Último Guerrero and Rey Bucanero. In June of that year, El Terrible broke away from \"Los Guapos\" and won the hair of Máscara Mágica. Terrible's replacement, Alan Stone hardly teamed with Shocker and Máscara Mágica afterward, and \"Los Guapos\" was effectively ended by the end of 2004. For most of the summer, he joined up with Perro Aguayo Jr. and Negro Casas in a feud against Pierroth Jr., Vampiro Canadiense and Tarzan Boy. The feud ended in a steel cage match where Perro Aguayo Jr. defeated Negro Casas for his hair. In 2005, he started out the year well winning the \"La Copa Junior\", a trophy for second-generation wrestlers with a finals win over Dr. Wagner Jr..\n\nIn April 2005, Shocker joined Total Nonstop Action Wrestling based in Orlando, Florida, around the same time Mexican TNA regular Héctor Garza, who was blocked from entering the United States after steroid problems. In one of his early matches with TNA, Shocker unsuccessfully challenged Christopher Daniels for the TNA X Division Championship at TNA's Hard Justice pay-per-view. In 2006, TNA made Shocker the captain of Team Mexico, which also included Puma, Magno and Incognito for the 2006 TNA World X Cup Tournament. Shocker and Magno defeated the team of Eric Young and Johnny Devine from Team Canada, but in the end the team came in third in the standings after being unsuccessful in the World X Cup finals at TNA's 2006 Sacrifice PPV. The tournament final turned out to be Shocker's last match with the company.\n\nWhile working for TNA, Shocker decided to leave CMLL, after having worked for them for 10 years, to work for CMLL's Mexican AAA alongside wrestlers such as Vampiro. In AAA, he started a feud with Cibernético, with the storyline being started when Cibernético attacked Shocker's father who was at ringside for one of Shocker's matches.\n\nThe feud reached its high point with a four-way \"Lucha de Apuestas\" match that included Shocker, Cibernético, Latin Lover and Chessman. The match was a steel cage match, with the added stipulation that the cage was supposedly electrified. The four faced off in the main event of AAA's 2005 \"Verano de Escándalo\" (\"Summer of Scandal\") PPV and saw Chessman lose the match to Latin Lover, while Shocker escaped the match without losing his hair.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the storyline with Cibernético, Shocker turned \"rudo\", attacking veteran Sangre Chicana. The storyline was that Shocker claimed that he was the real \"Amo de escandalo\" (\"Master of Scandal\"), which was Chicana's nickname at that point. The two faced off in a hair vs. hair match at the \"El Toreo de Cuatros Caminos\" bullfighting arena in Naucalpan, State of Mexico, with Shocker defeating Sangre Chicana in the semi-main event of the 2005 \"Guerra de Titanes\" (\"War of the Titans\").\n\nIn 2006, Shocker formed \"Los Guapos VIP\" in AAA, consisting of himself, Scorpio Jr. and Zumbido. The trio participated in a four-way trios match at the 2006 \"Rey de Reyes\" (\"King of Kings\") show, but were eliminated before the end of the match. \"Los Guapos\" later expanded with Alan Stone, allowing them to wrestle The Black Family (Chessman, Dark Ozz, Dark Cuervo and Dark Escoria) for the Mexican National Atómicos Championship on March 19, 2006, but were unsuccessful. In August 2006, Shocker left AAA.\n\nShocker jumped ship from AAA back to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre again in 2007. That same year, he teamed with Perro Aguayo Jr. and Héctor Garza in a failed bid to win the vacant CMLL World Trios Championship from Último Guerrero, Tarzan Boy and Atlantis in Mexico City on September 29, 2006. In early 2007, he entered a championship tournament for the vacant NWA International Junior Heavyweight Championship and lost to Hirooki Goto at the tournament finals in Mexico City on March 4. He and Dr. Wagner Jr. lost to Perro Aguayo Jr. and Héctor Garza in a match for the vacant WWA World Tag Team Championship in Tijuana on January 31, 2008.\n\nShocker has defeated a number of wrestlers in \"Luchas de Apuestas\" (bet matches), including Máscara Año 2000, Tarzan Boy, Vampiro Canadiense, Halloween, Kenzo Suzuki, Marco Corleone, Emilio Charles Jr., Bestia Salvaje, Mazada, Nosawa, Sangre Chicana, Rey Bucanero, and Black Warrior. On December 14, 2010, Shocker defeated El Texano Jr. to win the NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship, which predecessor, the NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship, he had already held twice before.\n\nHowever, just five days later, he suffered a patellar tendon rupture and a meniscal tear in his knee that required surgery and would sideline him for 12 to 16 weeks. On May 26, 2011, Shocker was stripped of the NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship. He would finally make his CMLL in-ring return on July 24. On November 16, Shocker formed a new group with Metro and CMLL newcomers Titán and Tritón. The group dissolved soon after being announced as Shocker was injured and Metro adopted a new ring persona, Diamante Azul.\n\nIn late 2012, the long-dormant rivalry between Shocker and his former tag-team partner Mr. Niebla rose to the surface again as the two began to work on opposite sides of a number of matches, with increasing intensity and animosity from both wrestlers. The two were paired up for the 2013 \"Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles\" as a way to continue the storyline. The team worked together without too many problems in the initial rounds as they defeated the teams of Marco Corleone and Kraneo and the team of Máscara Dorada and Mephisto to qualify for the semi-finals. In the semi-finals they lost to eventual tournament winners La Sombra and Volador Jr.. Following the loss, Shocker and Mr. Niebla argued and almost came to blows over who was responsible for losing the match. On July 19 at \"Infierno en el Ring\", Shocker won Mr. Águila's hair in a ten-man steel cage \"Lucha de Apuestas\". In early 2014, Shocker turned \"rudo\", just so he could feud with Rush.\n\nOn March 21, 2014, at \"Homenaje a Dos Leyendas\", Shocker lost his hair for the first time, when he was defeated by Rush in a \"Lucha de Apuestas\". On June 13, Shocker and Negro Casas defeated Rush and La Máscara to win the CMLL World Tag Team Championship. On April 3, 2015, Shocker, El Terrible and Rey Bucanero formed a new trio named (\"Terriblemente Guapo y un Rey\", \"Terribly Handsome King\").\n\nIn early 2016, Shocker suffered an injury that would require surgery and keep him out of the ring for almost six months. CMLL opted to not strip Shocker and Casas of the tag team championship during the long period of inactivity, which meant that there was eight months between the team defending the championship. Shocker and Casas successfully defended the championship against Atlantis and Diamante Azul on June 5, La Máscara and Sharlie Rockstar on July 18, and Místico and Volador Jr. on September 19, 2016. On February 14, 2018, CMLL vacated the CMLL World Tag Team Titles due to lack of defences since 2016.\n\n"}

Polish-Lithuanian army under Stefan Czarniecki and Paweł Jan Sapieha forced a Russian retreat through a carefully planned Polish hussar ambush and several tactically effective flanking maneuvers. The Russian defeat also meant they had to abandon the Siege of Lyakhavichy (Lachowicze).\n\nIn late June 1660, after the Treaty of Oliva, a Lithuanian army commanded by Paweł Jan Sapieha attacked Russians, who occupied most of the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Lithuanians were supported by Polish units under Stefan Czarniecki, and their target was to end the siege of Lachowicze. Polish - Lithuanian units, which altogether had 13,000 men and 2 cannons, set off from Słonim. Facing them was a Russian army under Ivan Andreyevich Khovansky (Tararui), who had unknown number of soldiers (some estimates claim 24,000; while some claim only 8,500).\n\nOn the morning of 28 June Polish front units, marching towards Baranowicze, crossed the Połonka river, east of the town of Połonka. Here, Poles encountered a Russian unit, and a skirmish began. When main Russian forces arrived, the Poles withdrew behind the river, and Polish - Lithuanian army began preparations for the battle. Poles were placed on the right flank, Lithuanians on the left, while central front was protected by mixed, Polish-Lithuanian units, together with artillery.\n\nFirst to attack were the Russians, who stormed the Polonka river levee. They were met with a heavy fire of the Polish-Lithuanian dragoons, and then a Polish hussar unit counterattacked, pushing the Russians back to their starting positions. Khovansky then decided to attack Lithuanian flank, using his cavalry. The Lithuanians, however, fiercely resisted the assault, and did not retreat to the river swamp.\n\nWhen dragoons of Stefan Czarniecki captured eastern bank of the levee, whole Polish - Lithuanian army carried out a frontal assault. Cavalry unit of Colonel Gabriel Wojnillowicz, which had been hidden behind Polish lines, bypassed the swamp and attacked left wing of the Russians. The Polish hussars and \"pancerni\" cavalry forced the Russian foot out of prepared positions, while the Commonwealth cavalry on the right attacked the Russian rear, which drove off the Muscovite horse and left the Russian infantry exposed. The Russians retreated towards Polock, and on the way they were chased by the Lithuanians, who killed hundreds. Khovansky himself managed to survive, together with a small cavalry group. Russian infantry, which remained at the battleground, was massacred or captured by the Commonwealth forces.\n\n"}

On cable, the station is available on Comcast Xfinity channels 13 and 433, and on EPB Fiber Optics channels 12 and 312 in the Chattanooga area. Although parts of the Chattanooga market are in the Central Time Zone, all schedules are listed in Eastern Time.\n\nThe station signed on the air on April 25, 1954, carrying programming from all four networks, though it has always been a primary CBS affiliate. It was owned by Joe Engel, who owned the Chattanooga Lookouts minor league baseball team as well as WDEF radio (1370 AM, now WXCT) and WDEF-FM (92.3). It took the CBS affiliation from WROM-TV (now WTVC, (hannel 9). It lost NBC to WRGP-TV (now WRCB-TV) in 1956, and lost ABC to WTVC (the former WROM) in 1958. During the late 1950s, the station was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network.\n\nRoy H. Park bought the WDEF stations in 1963. His media interests eventually became known as Park Communications, which was bought by Media General in 1997. In 2006, Media General sold the station to Morris Multimedia.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWDEF-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 12, on February 17, 2009, the original target date in which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 47 to VHF channel 12 for post-transition operations. Immediately before the shutdown, anchor Joe Legge gave a brief retrospective of the station's history as well as the farewell message for all analog viewers. The message ended with images of the past newscasts.\n\nSyndicated programming on WDEF includes \"Judge Judy\" and \"The Andy Griffith Show\". \n\nIn its early years, WDEF was locally oriented, offering a mix of children's shows, talk and variety programs, including \"Point of View\", one of the longest–running local public affairs programs in the United States.\n\nWDEF has been the local home of Tennessee Titans (based in Nashville) games since 1998 (when the team was still called the Oilers). This comes with its CBS affiliation, as CBS carries all National Football League games played in the afternoon that feature a road team from the American Football Conference, which the Titans play in.\n\nOn April 4, 2009 beginning with the station's 11 p.m. newscast, WDEF-TV became the first station in the Chattanooga market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition.\n\n"}

The film was released in the United States on January 12, 1996.\n\nSimilar to \"I'm Gonna Git You Sucka\", the film spoofs a number of African-American, coming-of-age, hood films such as \"Juice\", \"Jungle Fever\", \"South Central\", \"Higher Learning\", \"Do the Right Thing\", \"Poetic Justice\", \"New Jack City\", \"Dead Presidents\", \"Friday\", and most prominently \"Boyz n the Hood\", \"Menace II Society\" and \"Above the Rim\". The film's title borrows phrases from some of those films, and some of the actors who starred in those movies appear in the film, in some cases appearing in similar roles or scenes as the films being parodied.\n\nAshtray, Tray for short, is sent to the inner city to live with his father. Tray gets an education about life on the streets from his psychotic, gun-toting cousin Loc Dog, pot smoking foul mouthed Grandma, underage Pops, and gang members Preach, and Crazy Legs. At a picnic Tray falls for the infamous Dashiki, who has 7 Kids, much to the distaste of ex-convict Toothpick. While Ashtray and Loc Dog head to buy some snacks, Toothpick and his posse confront Ashtray and hold him at gunpoint, until Loc Dog threatens them with a missile mounted in the back of his van, stamped with the letters “USSR” Loc Dog claims it is in fact a nuclear device. Toothpick and his gang then flee the scene.\n\nLoc Dog and Ashtray get harassed in a Korean store by the owners and Loc Dog shoots at the owners when a remark is made about his mother. The two are then confronted by 'The Man' (a mysterious white, government figure) who kills the Koreans and tosses them his gun to frame them and leaves.\n\nMeanwhile, Ashtray and Loc Dog's Grandma ride to church and another elderly woman disses her, resulting in a breakdancing contest that Grandma wins.\n\nAshtray visits Dashiki where they engage in sexual intercourse and Dashiki immediately claims he has impregnated her. Feeling like he's not responsible enough to be the father, Dashiki kicks him out. Someone from Toothpick's posse threatens Ashtray, Loc Dog, Preach, and Crazy Legs. Loc Dog knocks him out as he and Preach proceed to stomp him, flattening him (literally). The quartet decides to get protection from their friend Old School.\n\nThis tactic fails as Toothpick performs a drive-by shooting and Crazy Legs is injured. With Crazy Legs hospitalized, himself and Loc Dog being arrested, and the Korean store shooting, Tray decides to confront Dashiki and be the father. Dashiki agrees to give Tray another try and they decide to leave the hood as planned.\n\nAshtray then reads a bedtime story to his Pops who is too young to go to a party in which causes him to ejaculate before going to sleep. At the party, Loc Dog meets Keisha, whom he then takes her to his mail truck to drink and have sex. During sexual intercourse, Keisha turns into a demonic monster, strips Loc Dog naked while he tries to run away and forces him to have sex with her while he screams.\n\nAshtray and Loc Dog talk about Ashtray's departure as Toothpick and his posse prepare for another drive-by. He and Loc Dog clash as Ashtray is shot. As Loc and Toothpick continue to exchange gunfire, Grandma pops out of the dumpster and shoots Toothpick's car. Toothpick is flung out and he lands on a cop car. Preach and Dashiki find Ashtray hurt and he regains consciousness and kisses Dashiki. A woman finds Toothpick (who turns out to be his mother) and beats him with his shoe for stealing from her in the past. Afterwards, Toothpick and his gang are presumably arrested.\n\nAfterwards, everyone goes their separate ways: Ashtray and Dashiki marry and enjoy their lives, Loc Dog becomes a host and introduces himself with extreme profanity, Preach and his crush settle down and perform sexual intercourse, Crazy Legs becomes a dancer as he had dreamed of, and Grandma is, as Ashtray puts it, \"still Grandma\" (showing her smoking marijuana).\n\n\n\"Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in The Hood\" collected $8,112,884 from 1,010 theatres its opening weekend, opening at #2 at the box office, averaging $8,032 per theatre. By the end of its theatrical run, the film domestically grossed $20,109,115.\n\nThe movie was met with a negative response from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 31% based on 26 reviews.\n\nThe soundtrack was released on January 9, 1996 by Island Records. It peaked at #18 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and #3 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. AllMusic rated this soundtrack three out of five stars.

On the maternal side he was the great-grandson of Roger Sherman, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the United States Constitution. His mother, Mary Evarts, was a daughter of Jeremiah Evarts and a sister of William M. Evarts, US Secretary of State, US Attorney General and a US Senator from New York. His father, David Greene, was for twenty years the corresponding secretary of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. In his eighth year the family moved to Westborough, Massachusetts, and two years later to Windsor, Vermont.\n\nHe graduated from Dartmouth College in 1859. During his college life, being largely dependent upon his own exertions for support, he taught school in vacations at Windsor in the winter of 1857/58, and at Falmouth, Massachusetts in the winter of 1858/59. Soon after his graduation he began the study of law in the office of Evarts, Southmayd & Choate, in New York City. In this office as student, and afterward as managing clerk, he gained preliminary legal training. In May 1862, in New York City, he was admitted to practice, but he soon abandoned his professional career and to enter the Union army.\n\nIn September 1862, he enlisted under commission as 2d Lieutenant of Company I, 3d Missouri Infantry; in March following he was promoted to 1st Lieutenant of the same company, and still later, in 1863, was made captain of Company C, 51st U. S. Colored Infantry., serving until honorably discharged by acceptance of his resignation in November 1865. He also served during this period as judge advocate of the District of Vicksburg at the close of 1864 and beginning of 1865, and judge advocate of the Western Division of Louisiana from June 1865, until retirement from service. He received a gunshot wound through the right arm in the general assault on Vicksburg while in command of his company on May 22, 1863. Just before his military service, Judge Greene was offered the position of Assistant United States District Attorney for the Southern District of New York, but declined the office.\n\nIn January 1866, he resumed a legal practice in Chicago, occupying the same office with Perkin Bass, then United States attorney, with whom he was associated in practice.\n\nHe remained in Chicago until his appointment by President Ulysses S. Grant to associate justice of the Supreme Court of Washington Territory, 1870-79. He settled at Olympia, and in 1880 he was commissioned chief justice, at which time he moved to Seattle. In 1883 he was re-appointed chief justice and served until the close of his term in March 1887. In March 1887, he formed a professional copartnership with Honorable Cornelius H. Hanford, who later became a United States District Judge for the District of Washington, and Honorable John H. McGraw, who became Governor of the State of Washington, under the firm name of Greene, Hanford & McGraw; afterward, in August, the firm was enlarged by the addition of another member, Joseph F. McNaught, Esquire, under the firm name of Greene, McNaught, Hanford & McGraw.\n\nIn July 1888, the partnership was dissolved by mutual consent, all the partners retiring from practice, the senior partner on account of temporary ill-health, Messrs. McNaught and McGraw to enter other pursuits and Judge Hanford to become chief justice of the Supreme Court of Washington Territory. In 1889 Judge Greene resumed the practice of law, and in 1890 formed a partnership with L. Theodore Turner of Seattle, under the firm name of Greene & Turner. In 1889 he was trustee and secretary of the Seattle Investment Co. In 1890 he became trustee and secretary of the Seattle Trust Co, and trustee and vice president of Rainier Power and Railway Co., 1890-1893.\n\nGreene was identified with the Republican Party until the year 1888, when he joined the Prohibition movement. He was a Prohibition Party candidate for US Congress from Washington, 1888; and the Prohibition candidate for Governor of the State of Washington, 1892.\n\nReligiously, his parents being Congregationalists, his first church connection was with the church of that denomination in Windsor, where his membership remained until after the war. Then he united with the New England Congregational Church of Chicago. Afterward he was a constituent and prominent member of the Lincoln Park Church. On removal to Olympia he joined the Baptist church.\n\nJudge Greene was married August 17, 1866, at Whitewater, Wisconsin, to Grace, daughter of Jesse and Rhoda (Brockett) Wooster of Naugatuck, Connecticut. They had four children: Agnes Margaret, born October 18, 1868; Roger Sherman, born September 29, 1870; Grace Evarts, born January 15, 1875, and Mary Rhoda, born July 27, 1876.\n\nJudge Greene is interred at Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park in Seattle, Washington.\n\n"}

{"id": "2156519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156519", "title": "Le Locle", "text": "Le Locle\n\nLe Locle (German: Luggli) is a municipality in Le Locle District in the Canton of Neuchâtel in Switzerland.\n\nIt is situated in the Jura Mountains, a few kilometers from the city of La Chaux-de-Fonds.\nIt is the third smallest city in Switzerland (in Switzerland a place needs more than 10,000 inhabitants to be considered a city).\n\nLe Locle is known as a center of Swiss watchmaking, even cited as the birthplace of the industry, with roots dating back to the 1600s. The municipality has been home to manufactures such as Favre-Leuba Mido, Zodiac, Tissot, Ulysse Nardin, Zenith, Montblanc, Certina as well as Universal Genève, before the latter company relocated to Geneva. The town's history in watchmaking is documented at one of the world's premier horological museums, the Musée d'Horlogerie du Locle, Monts Castle, located in a 19th-century country manor on a hill north of the city Restored historic underground mills (grainmill, oilmill, sawmill) can be seen in a cave located about one kilometer () west of the city center.\n\nThe name of the town derives from the word for \"lake\" or \"trou d´eau\".\n\nLe Locle, as well as La Chaux-de-Fonds, owes its survival to the manufacturing and exports of watches. The industry of watch making was brought to Le Locle in the 17th century by Daniel JeanRichard, a self-taught watchmaker who encouraged the farmers of the area to start manufacturing watch components for him during the long winters. In the 20th century, the micro-mechanical industry was added.\n\nThe watchmaking cities of Le Locle and La Chaux-de-Fonds have jointly received recognition from UNESCO for their exceptional universal value.\n\nDue to the altitude (around ) and the lack of water (porous limestone underground) the land is ill-suited to farming. Planning and buildings reflect the watch-making artisans' need for rational organization. They were rebuilt in the early 19th Century, after extensive fires.\n\nAlong an open-ended scheme of parallel strips on which residential housing and workshops intermingle, their town planning reflects the needs of the local watch-making culture that dates back to the 17th century, and which is still alive today. Both towns present outstanding examples of mono-industrial manufacturing towns, which are still well-preserved and active. Their urban planning has accommodated the transition from the artisans’ production of a cottage industry to the more concentrated factory production of the late 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nKarl Marx described La Chaux-de-Fonds as a “huge factory-town” in \"Das Kapital\", where he analyzed the division of labour in the watch-making industry of the Jura.\n\nIt is the tenth Swiss site to be awarded World Heritage status, joining others such as the Old City of Bern, the Rhaetian Railway, and the Abbey and Convent of St. Gall.\n\nLe Locle is first mentioned in 1332 as \"dou Locle\".\n\nThe earliest traces of human settlements come from the end of the Mesolithic period (6000–5000 BC) in shelter in the Col des Roches. The site includes the oldest pottery found in the Canton of Neuchâtel, along with many tools, the molar of a mammoth and deer and wild boar bones. The shelter was discovered in 1926 by a customs official and was the first site of its kind studied in Switzerland.\n\nHowever, between 4000 BC and the Middle Ages nothing is known about the Le Locle area.\n\nIn 1150 the valley, in which Le Locle would later be built, was granted by Renaud and William Valanginian to the abbey of Fontaine-André. In 1360, John II of Aarberg, the Lord of Valanginian, received Le Locle as a fief from Count Louis of Neuchâtel. The heavily wooded portion of the Jura Mountains around Le Locle, were cleared by colonists who later received the status of free peasants. These first free farmers received a charter in 1372 which codified their rights and freedoms. At the beginning of the 15th century, this charter was reconfirmed during the foundation of the Mairie or town government. The inhabitants of Le Locle were given the right to own land that they had cleared, as long as they continued to farm it and paid taxes on it. The feudal lords granted them these freedoms to encourage settlements in the mountains. Beginning in the 14th Century Le Locle and La Sagne formed a parish together. The Church of Mary Magdalene in Le Locle was built in 1351.\n\nAs a result of increasing cross-border conflicts, in 1476, Le Locle entered into a defensive alliance with Bern.\n\nIn 1502, 37 people in Le Locle were given the opportunity to pay £1780 for the title of \"Citizen of Valangin\". These citizens had the privilege to lead the community and to choose their own mayor and bailiff.\n\nThe tower of the Church of Mary Magdalene, the landmark of the city, arose early in the 16th century. A few years after the tower was built, in 1536, Le Locle converted to the Protestant faith. This old church was rebuilt in the mid-18th century. A German church was built in 1844, but demolished in 1967. The Catholic chapel was built in 1861.\n\nIn 1592, the Valangin fiefs returned to the County of Neuchâtel, but neither the legal status of residents of the Mairie of Le Locle or its function as a district court was affected. The 1476 alliance with Bern remained in effect and during the Thirty Years' War as well as the invasion of Louis XIV in Franche-Comté, Bernese soldiers came to support the town. Le Locle sent soldiers to support their ally in 1712 during the battles of Mellingen and Villmergen.\n\nLe Locle's location near the French border meant that the town often enjoyed a close relationship with France. This was especially true during the years leading up to the French Revolution. Many residents of Le Locle met in the Jacobin club in Morteau swear their support of the Constitution of 1792. The revolutionary spirit led to conflicts between supporters of the revolution and the old government. The subsequent government repression drove many residents of Le Locle into exile in the spring of 1793. Several hundred people moved to Besançon, where they found work at the National Watch Factory which had been established by the National Convention. When they returned to Le Locle, they brought skilled watchmakers along with a republican attitude.\n\nIn 1707, the Principality of Neuchâtel went to King Frederick I in Prussia of the Berlin-based Hohenzollern, who then ruled Neuchâtel in personal union. Napoléon Bonaparte deposed King Frederick William III of Prussia as prince of Neuchâtel and appointed instead his chief of staff Louis-Alexandre Berthier. In 1814 the principality was restored to Frederick William III. A year later he agreed to allow the principality to join the Swiss Confederation, then not yet an integrated federation, but a confederacy, as a full member. Thus Neuchâtel became the first and only monarchy to join the otherwise entirely republican Swiss cantons. This changed in 1848, when the peaceful Neuchâtel Revolution started in Le Locle. The royalist forces quickly surrendered and on 28 February 1848, the flag of the Helvetic Republic, a symbol of the republic, was hoisted over the city. The new republic and canton established the Le Locle Prefecture, which existed until 1935. During the unsuccessful counter-revolution of 1856 the town was briefly occupied by the royalists.\n\nLe Locle was repeatedly burned by large fires (1683, 1765, 1833). It was rebuilt to its present appearance in the second quarter of the 19th century, as it became a center of the watch industry.\n\nBecause the small Bied river often flooded the valley, a channel was cut through the valley to the Col des Roches at the beginning of the 19th century. Until 1898 the river was used to provide power for several underground mills.\n\nThe city government established the high school in 1855 and opened a teacher training college in 1866 followed by a trade school in 1897. The watchmaking school was established in 1868 which was the foundation for the technical school established in 1901–02. This school eventually became the Engineering Department of the \"Haute école d'arts appliqués Arc\" as well as the engineering school of the inter-regional vocational education center \"Montagnes neuchâteloises\".\n\nThe city made great efforts in the construction of railways. The first line to La Chaux-de-Fonds (1857) was joined by lines to Besançon (1884) and Les Brenets (1890). Nevertheless, Le Locle suffers from a certain isolation and a large amount of traffic that is only passing through.\n\nLe Locle owes its prosperity essentially to the watch industry, in particular the manufacture of precision watches and machine tools. Daniel Jean Richard was among the pioneers who founded this branch of industry in and around Le Locle. In the Le Locle region, there were only some 77 watchmakers who were active in 1750. By 1800, that number had increased to over 800. Watchmaking began to replace agriculture and lace making as the main industries. By the end of the 18th Century the city employed about 500 lace makers.\n\nLe Locle was home to a number of famous watchmakers and inventors, including Abraham-Louis Perrelet, Jacques-Frédéric Houriet, Frédéric-Louis Favre-Bulle and David-Henri Grandjean. In the 19th century the town was known for its pocket and marine chronometers. The watchmaking industry transformed Le Locle into an industrial city. Initially all the work was done by hand in small shops, but by the last quarter of the 19th Century the first factories were built. The introduction of mechanized production, pushed the industry from completed watches toward machine tools and watch components. During the two World Wars, some plants, such as Zenith, later Dixi, specialized in the production of weapons. Watchmaking also required a number of associated artists and inventors. The bookseller and publisher Samuel Girardet (1730–1807) started decorating clock cases and eventually founded a dynasty of artists and engravers. The Huguenin became famous for their work painting clock housings and medals. Opening in 1856, the chocolate and confectionery factory Klaus operated until 1992.\n\nAs in most watchmaking cities in the Jura, the political and social life in Le Locle was heavily influenced by the ideas of radicalism, socialism and later anarchism. Professor James Guillaume proposed the creation of a section of the Workers International in 1866. German-speaking socialist organizations including the \"Grütliverein\" and the \"Arbeiterverein\" testify that by the end of the 19th Century, many workers from the German-speaking Switzerland worked in Le Locle. The Socialists organized themselves into a political party in 1897 and by 1912 were a majority in the municipality. In 1956, they allied and were supported by the Swiss Party of Labour. The Socialists lost their seat in the local government council in the 1992 elections, to the \"movement Droit de parole\", which does not have a traditional party platform. In 2004, for the first time the council was determined by a plebiscite, which gave the Swiss Party of Labour (PdA) three seats, the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland (PS) and the \"liberale Parti progressiste national\" one seat each.\n\nLe Locle is located on the Swiss side of the \"cluse\" Col des Roches, which forms the border between France and Switzerland.\n\nLe Locle has an area, , of .

Sometime in the 1930s, five families who were engaged in fishing landed in the up-end of the river, and settled in the area for easy access to the fishing grounds. The area became known for its bountiful fish catch, and therefore more people from neighboring areas also came and settled. The distinctive visual quality of the area was an endemic species of tree known as \"barobo\" (diplodiscus paniculatus), which was plentiful on the site of the settlement. Subsequently, the place became popularly known as Barobo.\nBarobo subsequently became a barrio under the municipality of Lianga. The creation of the province of Surigao del Sur under R.A. No. 2786, series of June 1960, created the municipality of Barobo on October 24, 1960, by virtue of Executive Order No. 407 issued by President Carlos P. Garcia. Thus the Municipality of Barobo was carved out (in a shape resembling that of a cigar pipe) from its mother municipality, Lianga.\n\nA native Barobohanon speaks Kamayo, a minor language spoken in the area of Barobo and also in Bislig City, San Agustin and Marihatag, Surigao del Sur province in the southern Philippines. It has 7,565 speakers (2000, WCD).

{"id": "2156522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156522", "title": "Institution (computer science)", "text": "Institution (computer science)\n\nThe notion of institution was created by Joseph Goguen and Rod Burstall in the late 1970s, in order to deal with the \"population explosion among the logical systems used in computer science\". The notion tries to capture the essence of the concept of \"logical system\".\n\nThe use of institutions makes it possible to develop concepts of specification languages (like structuring of specifications, parameterization, implementation, refinement, development), proof calculi and even tools in a way completely independent of the underlying logical system. There are also morphisms that allow to relate and translate logical systems. Important applications of this are re-use of logical structure (also called borrowing), heterogeneous specification and combination of logics. \n\nThe spread of institutional model theory has generalized various notions and results of model theory, and institutions themselves have impacted the progress of universal logic.\nThe theory of institutions does not assume anything about the nature of the logical system. That is, models and sentences may be arbitrary objects; the only assumption is that there is a satisfaction relation between models and sentences, telling whether a sentence holds in a model or not. Satisfaction is inspired by Tarski's truth definition, but can in fact be any binary relation.\nA crucial feature of institutions is that models, sentences, and their satisfaction, are always considered to live in some vocabulary or context (called signature) that defines the (non-logical) symbols that may be used in sentences and that need to be interpreted in models. Moreover, signature morphisms allow to extend signatures, change notation, and so on. Nothing is assumed about signatures and signature morphisms except that signature morphisms can be composed; this amounts to having a \ncategory of signatures and morphisms. Finally, it is assumed that signature morphisms lead to translations of sentences and models in a way that satisfaction is preserved. While sentences are translated along with signature morphisms (think of symbols being replaced along the morphism), models are translated (or better: reduced) against signature morphisms: for example, in case of a signature extension, a model of the (larger) target signature may be reduced to a model of the (smaller) source signature by just forgetting some components of the model.\n\nFormally, an institution consists of\n\n\nsuch that for each formula_5 in formula_1 the following satisfaction condition holds:\n\nformula_20 if and only if formula_21\n\nfor each formula_22 and formula_23.\n\nThe satisfaction condition expresses that truth is invariant under change of notation \n(and also under enlargement or quotienting of context).\n\nStrictly speaking, the model functor ends in the \"category\" of all large categories.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Economic pressures felt immediately by its local stakeholders; controversially and concurrently, the Philippine political machinery intervened at the national stage. Short-lived environmental court sanctions was then rescinded later that same year due to an injunctive relief from \"filed motions and appeal for reconsideration\" allowing mining re-operations that environmental group Caraga Watch vehemently contested as \"inutile and bankrupt mining law and policies;\" further prompting for pre-emptive, sensible environmental watch and on-going national/local discussions before waking-up to extractive gas drill operations in its shorelines.\n\nThe ideal candidate site of proposed wind power projects is located approximately 300 meter masl in the mining area near Carrascal.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nHinatuan is approximately 44 kilometers (27 miles) north of Bislig, a component city in the same province.\n\nPre-spanish Era\n\nThe history of Hinatuan in the annals of historical heritage can be traced back from the time of the Spaniards in this part of Mindanao. The intermingling of tribes such as the Manobos, the Mansakas, Subanons and the Mandayas through assimilation and amalgamation leads to the final unification of a group of people who settled in the old town site known as Da-an Lungsod. Being the first and the earliest settlement, it was later identified as part of the province of Caraga under the administration of the politico - militar of Encomienda Bislig.\n\nThe name Hinatuan, originally derived from the word \"\"Hato\"\" and later called \"\"Hatudan\"\" was handed down from generation to generation through oral version. These words have two versions - \" Hato \" in the native dialect simply connotes a method of preserving fish, the place being abundantly noted for fish. In fact, fishing is the major occupation of the inhabitants. To denote a place , a suffix \" an \" was added to \" Hato \" to become \" Hatuan \"meaning a place where to preserve fish.\n\nSpanish Era\n\nIn 1856, the town was transferred to its present site, formerly known as \"\"Hinatudan\"\" now known as Hinatuan as ordered by the higher Spanish authorities. A political government was set up with Raymundo Bandola, the first captain known as defender of the town against the Moro piracy. He was followed by Capitanes Edobigito Lindo, Atanacio de Castro, Tomas Luna, Fernando Nazareno and Teodoro Villaluz. Eugenio Villaluz was accredited the last capitan under the Spanish regime, the first and last captain under the First Philippine Republic, and the first presidential appointee under the American regime. These mentioned capitanes contributed much to the building of the physical set up of the town.\n\nThe appointed presidents following Eugenio Villaluz were : Mariano Verano, Pablo Evangelio, Nicomedes Villaluz and Ex-Captain Fernando Nazareno. Domingo Balbuena was the first president - elect and followed by Florencio Villaluz, Antonio Picazales,Victoriano Evangelio, Modesto Raura and Damian Siano. Again, these town executives were responsible for the expansion of the town to a larger area.\n\nJapanese Era\n\nWorld War II broke out. A few months later, a strong typhoon hit Hinatuan. Heavy damages inflected to both private and public properties especially to buildings, coconut plantations and other potential crops, forest reserves, and machineries and equipment of the Portlamon Lumber Company. Guerilla activities then sprung up to lessen the influence and strength of the Armed Forces of the Empire of Japan and to prepare the people for liberation of the country by the allied forces.\n\nPost War\n\nAfter the war, Elpedio Chavez was appointed mayor of the town. He was later followed by the first-elect, Mayor Tito Cañedo, Sr., under the Republic of the Philippines. He helped much in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the town. He was followed by Mayor Joaquin Villaluz , Segundo Cuyno, Sr., Candelario Viola, Sr., Jose Pepino, Sr., the mayor under the Martial Law period, LADP scholar Atty. Candelario J. Viola, Jr., Cristina M. Camba, Dr. Alicia V. Momongan and the incumbent Mayor Shem G.

Indeed, it was Paradise where nature remained undisturbed.\n\nThen men settled along the cove near river in the south. It was said that these early inhabitants were the Manobos who were ruled by a Chieftain (Datu). Their clothes were made of woven abaca fiber and adorned themselves with multi-colored beads. Land and water resources were abundant, hence they love to hunt in the forest, gather shells along the shores and fish in the rivers. there was peace and harmony among the early inhabitants. They were happy and contended. Later however, as their tribes increased their descendants thought of moving to surrounding areas, so there was rivalry as to who will own choice pieces of land. Whenever disputes overland ownership and quarrel among themselves occurred, it was settled in a duel alongside the river in the North. Whoever won was proclaimed a \"Daugan\" o \"Mananaog\" by the Chieftain (Datu). The place became popular, hence \nthe river was named Pananag-an.\n\nPeople going to the other side of the river have to wade across it slowly as the current was swift, it always took them such time to reach the other side of the river and they often say to themselves \"Langan Pagtabok\" of \"Malangan Kita\" (It delays to cross or we will be delayed). One day, as the old folks claimed, a foreigner passed by the place. After having crossed the river, he asked the people the name of the place. Thinking that the stranger was asking what they were doing, they answered \"Langan pagtabok\". The foreigner heard \"Langan\" and thought it was the name of the place, then people started calling the whole settlement \"Langan\". Later, with he influence of the Spanish \"Li\" alphabet, Langan was pronounced \"Liangan\". As generations passed, the final \"N\" in Llangan was dropped and the \"Ll\" sound was changed to \"Li\", hence says that is how Lianga got its name.\n\nLianga is one of the oldest towns of the province of Surigao del Sur by virtue of Executive Order No. 27 on October 17, 1919. The municipality of Lianga is centrally located in the province of Surigao del Sur. It is situated along the Lianga Bay facing the Pacific Ocean and cradled by its shorelines and the Diwata Mountains. Its latitude is 30 and longitude is within 12635 and is bounded on the North by Municipality of San Agustin, on the South by the Municipality of Barobo, on the West by province of Agusan del Sur and the East lies the Pacific Ocean. It is 90.0 kilometers to the south of Tandag City, the Capital of the Province, 237 kilometers from the City of Davao, 121 kilometers from the Butuan City and 16 kilometers from Prosperidad, the Capital Town of Agusan del Sur (via Lianga–Los Arcos Road).\n\nIn the history of CARAGA Region, Lianga was part of the encomienda way back in 1655 under the command of Sergeant Martin Sanchez dela Cuesta. this encomienda covered Palaso (Cantilan). Tandag as its capital, Tago, Marihatag and Lianga. From 1904 to 1936, the Head of the Town was called President, per record obtained, the first elected President of Lianga was Cornelio Layno, whose two-year term covered the period from 1904 to 1906. The first elected Mayor was Otilio Navarro who served from 1937 to 1940. From then on, there were seven (7) elected Mayors of Lianga from 1941 up to the present. Within these periods, two became Mayors by succession, another two by appointment.\n\nAlmost half a century ago, the territorial land area of Lianga was vast, considering the fact that the present municipalities of San Agustin, Marihatag and Barobo were once a part of Lianga. The births of these three municipalities were the results of political subdivisions authored by the political leaders of the undivided Surigao. San Agustin formerly called (Oteiza) was the first daughter municipality of Lianga created under Executive Order No. 445 in 1951, during the Presidency of then Elpidio Quirino. The Governor of Surigao that time was late Vicente L. Pimentel. Four years later, the Municipality of Marihatag was created under Republic Act No. 1261 on June 10, 1955. As the population of Lianga increased, it was not spared from further political subdivision. The Electorate in the southern barrios of Lianga moved for the creation of another municipality, called the Municipality of Barobo as the seat of the Municipal government. The creation of the Municipality of Barobo was made through Executive Order no. 407 and 2786 on October 24, 1960. Of the three municipalities created from the municipality of Lianga, Marihatag has the largest land area. It is sad to note that among these four municipalities formerly referred to as the \"BLOM\" Area (for Barobo, Lianga, Oteiza, and Marihatag) Lianga, the mother municipality has the smallest land area with only 15,000 hectares.\n\nSignificant development in Lianga has been noted since 1960 with the creation of Surigao del Sur as a Province (Republic Act 2786).\nIt was more evident in the 70's to 80's when the coastal barangay of Diatagon [Jiatagon] became the hub of socio–economic activities with the Lianga Bay Logging Company Incorporated [LBLCI] which was a rich source of income. The town of Lianga, too that time started to gain a breakthrough not only in the infrastructure projects such as roads and government buildings but also in income derived from taxes especially from forest products utilized by the wood processing plant of LBLCI. Barangay Saint Christine has become the minor urban center and Lianga was classified as the influence center of the satellite municipalities of San Agustin, Marihatag, and Barobo.\n\nLianga is relatively urbanized area where 13,830 or 55.30% of the total population live in three urban centers of Barangays Poblacion, Saint Christine, and Diatagon [Jiatagon] and 11,175 or 44.70% lives in the remaining rural barangay with a municipal population density equivalent to 98.70% person/km. \nThe economic situation in the municipality poses great challenges to its leader and people. Its economy remains predominantly agricultural. It is gifted by its geographic location but is not adequately blessed by nature with substantial endowment necessary to propel itself into a developing economy. The major crop is Coconut, covering an area of 4,236 hectares. Rice ranks second with an area of 1,890 hectares. Other crops are Corn, Banana, and Abaca. The Poblacion and Barangay Diatagon [Jiatagon] are the trading centers with most of the commodities coming from Davao, Butuan, and Surigao. The poor road condition limits the economic activities in the area.\n\nInatu Festival – \"Inatu\" is from the kamayo language means \"our very own\". Celebrated every January.\n\n\nThere are several Lumad Community schools built by Lumad tribe themselves. These schools are built due to the neglect of the government in providing education to the indigenous peoples.\n\n\nThese Lumad schools have been in the vanguard in fighting for the ancestral lands and the rights of the Lumad. And this has become a problem for the mining and logging companies wanting to grab the lands; which is why these schools are constantly being attacked by the paramilitary, the military and the government itself.\n\n2015 Lianga Massacre\n\nOn September 1, 2015, executive director of ALCADEV Inc was killed right inside the school premises while two other Lumad leaders, Dionel Campos and Datu Bello Sinzo were killed in front of the community by the AFP-backed paramilitary group Magahat-Bagani. \nNational Literacy Awards\nThese Lumad schools in Lianga have been awarded the Most Outstanding Literacy Program of Caraga region and in the Philippines for several years. This award is given by the Department of Education - Literacy Coordinating Council.\n\nControversy\n\nThere are allegations that both schools are not recognized by the Department of Education thus their curriculum are not accredited. In effect, students who would like to transfer to other DepEd recognized school is a big challenge continuing the year level of the student. If student would like to move to high school or college is not possible.\n\n\nAnd many many more.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nMadrid was named after the capital city of Spain, Madrid. It has 14 barangays and two comprising the Poblacion: Linibunan and Quirino.\n\nThe municipality of Madrid lies in the northern part of the province, in the cluster known as CarCanMadCarLan area. It is bounded in the east by the Pacific Ocean, the Diwata Mountain in the west, the municipality of Cantilan in the north and Lanuza in the South. It is about from the capital town of Tandag, the seat of the provincial government of Surigao del Sur, and from the city of Surigao. Madrid is a narrow land along the coast of Surigao del Sur with an area of , representing 3.17 per cent of the province total land area of 445,216 hectares.\n\nMadrid has four kinds of soil type. Of the total land area, mountain soil undifferentiated comprises 9,413 hectares or 66.65 percent; San Manuel silt loam with 4,617 hectares or 32.69 percent; Matho loam has an area of 62 hectares and 30 hectares of Kabatohan loam.\n\nApproximately 5,210 hectares or 36.89 percent of the total land area is classified under 0–3% slope; 406 hectares or 2.87 percent under 3–5% slope; 1,009 hectares or 7.15 percent under 5–8% slope; 1,283 hectares or 9.09 percent under 8–15% slope and 6,214 hectares or 44.00 percent falls under 15%- above slope classification.\n\nMadrid is politically subdivided into 14 barangays.\nMadrid, like the whole island of Mindanao is considered having a tropical climate, with an average monthly precipitation of 308.66 mm (12.5 inches). The town is classified as under the type II climate classification. However, its wettest season fall between the months of November until March. Dry season start between April to September with brief afternoon showers and thunderstorms locally called sobasco.\n\nThe early beginning of the history of Madrid is described to be a typical one of a community development on the edge of a river, this river is presently called Carac-an and said to be once abundant of fish, shrimps, and other creatures, which served as are reliable source of food for the early inhabitants. The river runs in the Southern boundary of the municipality and it is now the main source of irrigation water supplying all irrigable lands of Madrid and the neighboring municipality of Cantilan.\n\nThe original name of Madrid was “Linibunan” a Visayan term describing a place covered by soil deposits which has been transported by force of nature. Linibunan came to be settled with more people when the Carac-an River gradually changed its course.\n\nThe growing community of Linibunan had been the object concern of the Municipality of Cantilan being parts of the territorial jurisdiction. Having recognized Linibunan to attain the qualification of a barrio, the Municipality Government of Cantilan, granted its creation as a barrio in the year 1911.\n\nReligion, particularly Roman Catholic, had been the predominated the spiritual life of the people from the beginning and to the presents. The Catholic faith had been nurtured through the years under the administration of the missionary center, which was established in the year 1951. There were no recorded obstacles in the propagation and preservation of the Catholic faith for the fact that most Visayans composing the majority of the inhabitants were Catholic.\n\nOn June 13, 1913, the missionary authorities in Cantilan created the parish in Linibunan and assigned a parish priest named Fr. Garcia. Father Garcia contributed significantly to the historical making of the Municipality of Madrid, because he was responsible for changing the name Linibunan to Madrid, after the capital city of Spain. From then on, church documents bore the name Madrid Parish and gradually the name Linibunan became extinct. The name Madrid was officially recognized as the name of a new Municipality of Cantilan as embodied in Executive Order No. 561, dated February 2, 1953.\n\nThe Municipality of Madrid was once a part of Cantilan town. It was only declared Municipality on February 2, 1953. Madrid is blessed to have the Carac-an River. This River serves as the main source of sand and gravel to the entire CarCanMadCarLan region, as well as its watershed. Carac-an River will soon be a major source of power via the proposed construction of a mini hydropower plant. It is also a popular site for camping, and the provincial jamboree is often held here. One of the longest bridges in Mindanao is also located here.\n\nChristianity first came into this part of Mindanao when in 1598, a Portuguese ship under Captain Francisco de Castro accidentally drifted into the east coast of Mindanao, part of the third district known as the District of Caraga which covered the present provinces of Surigao del Sur, Surigao del Norte, Agusan Provinces and a part of Davao. On board the ship were two Jesuit missionaries, Fr. Valerio Ledesma, S.J., and Manuel Marino, a lay brother, who preached the gospel and baptized the inhabitants. But, it was only in 1596 that the first batch of Jesuit missionaries stationed themselves permanently in Butuan, at the town of Buenavista, and from there, they established mission posts in nearby areas. They were followed by the Recollects and then by the Benedictines.\n\nThe first center of Christianity in this part of Mindanao was Tandag, which was established in 1622; Siargao in 1623; Bislig in 1624; Surigao in 1754 and in Cantilan in 1851.\n\nWhen Cantilan was established as the first center of missionary activity in 1851, Madrid was only a remote small sitio of Cantilan with few scattered houses. The small group of inhabitants in the area kept on clearing the land and planted it with various crops, predominantly rice. As a result of their hard and painstaking labor, the land became livable. The fertility of the soil and the proximity of the river began to attract people from the nearby places. Years after, they organized themselves and declared independence from the municipality of Cantilan.\n\nNotable pioneers in the region were Rufino Urbiztondo, Cosme Frias, Andres Roy, Jorge Arpilleda, Antonio Malayao, Antonio Taguines, Geronimo Rubi, Isidro Uriarte, Enrique Guillen, Pedro Uriarte, Tomas Frias, Andres Arnan, Mariano Cuartero, and others. The settlement continued to attract people; his constant coming of immigrants and intermarriages among inhabitants increased considerably the population until finally, the local leaders found it for to convert the sitio into a barrio. Under the leadership of Rufino Urbiztondo, Linibunan, as the place was known, became a barrio of Cantilan with him as its first Teniente del Barrio. Linibunan means \"water-covered lowland\". Digging around the place will attest to the fact that the topsoil in the area was deposited by floodwaters during the rainy season.\n\nThe early inhabitants of the place were religious people. Most of them were Christian and the missionaries based in Cantilan who visited the barrio once in a while to attend to their religious needs. In 1901, the people thought of Christianizing the name of their barrio. Fr. Paulino Garcia who was then the parish priest of Cantilan and a Spaniard by nationality, suggested that the barrio be named Madrid reminiscing of the Spanish capital. The people readily accepted the suggestion and since then, Linibunan was changed to Madrid.\n\nFor a decade, progress seemed slow, but then immigrants from other neighboring islands came, especially from Bohol, seeking good fortune in the reputed Land of Promise. A handful of Chinese came and engaged in business and trade with the natives. Due to its favorable geographical location, Madrid became the center of trade and commerce in the area. With the rapid growth of commerce and trade, population also increased. Business enterprises boomed and people started making permanent residences in the town. Then the local leaders became aware that Madrid can now qualify into a municipality. Headed by then Teniente del Barrio Sotero Irrizari, the Barrio Council and other Civic Leaders passed a resolution asking the President of the Philippines to elevate Madrid into a municipality. With the help of the Provincial Board, the cherished dream of the people of Madrid become a reality when President Elpedio Quirino issued Executive Order No. 561 making Madrid as one of the municipalities of Surigao del Sur on February 2, 1953. The municipality was inaugurated on July 4, 1953 amidst great splendor.\n\nIt maybe well to mention that when Madrid became a municipality on February 2, 1953 by virtue of Executive Order 561, there was some kind of controversy as to who will be the first mayor. However, a long and protracted legal battle, the courts settled the controversy and proclaimed Guillermo Arpilleda as the first mayor of Madrid.\n\nMadrid today has a total of fourteen (14) barangays and a population of around 14,500 people. Classified as a 5th class municipality, it is the commercial hub of the CarCanMadCarLan area.\n\nThe alluring Town of Madrid was once a barrio of Cantilan. It was created into a municipality on February 2, 1953 by virtue of the Executive Order No. 561. As early as the 1950s settlements was so vibrant for such reason as it was separated from Cantilan. Data shows that upon the conduct of 1960 census, the town posted 8198 people. The population grew at the average growth rate of 3.038 percent, and the 1970 census recorded a total of 11,059 people. A sudden drop in population was experienced, with the 1975 census counting 10,627 people, the lowest among the recorded censuses. The decrease in population was attributed to an insurgency in the hinterland barangays of Madrid. Peace and order was slightly stabilized in the 1980s, resulting in an increase in population at 3.329 percent growth rate. The 1980s were a highly productive decade wherein agricultural activities, and therefore the population, increase. As younger generations leave in search of better academic pursuits, the average growth rate has leveled at 0.023 percent, and population growth models predict an average of 15 people added annually to the total municipal population.\n\nMore than 53 percent of the total municipal population falls within age-bracket of 15 to 64 years old and more than 40 percent of the total population is between 1 and 14 years old, with only about 5 percent of the population over 65 years of age. According to the 1995 census, there were 97 males for every 100 females.\n\nMore than 72 percent of the total municipal population belongs to the age bracket of more than 10 years old or it can be expressed numerically as 9,456 people. More than 53 percent of the household population ages more than 10 years old are legally married. It can be noted that there were more female population who are legally married than the male population by 51 percent. Married population is concentrated between the age-bracket of 25 to 34 years old and this suggest for a higher fertility and an expected population growth. On the other hand, single individuals comprised 41 percent of the total population. For 3880 single individuals, males dominated this status than the females. Single population group concentrated between the age-bracket of 10 to 19 years old and slowly declining towards 20 years and more. More than 6 percent of the remaining population ages more than 10 years old belonged to widow, separated/divorced, common law/live-in and others.\n\nThere are four major dialects been spoken in the town. More than 97 percent of the total household population speak Surigaonon. More than 1.8 percent speak Manobo.\n\nThe town is dominated by Roman Catholic by more than 87 percent. There are other religious sects present in the area as such Aglipayans, Iglesia ni Cristo, UCCP, Islam and other Protestants groups.\n\nAbout 8,434 people who are considered as productive population ages more than 15 years old, more than 63 percent are in the labor force. More than 92 percent of the household populations who are in the labor force are employed and roughly 8 percent are considered as unemployed. The remaining 36 percent of the total household population considered as productive individuals are not in the labor force.\n\nMadrid is not actually identified as a major tourist destination of the Province of Surigao del Sur due to the lack of existing attractions, facilities and amenities. Tourism related activities have never been developed nor given as top priority project because of strong competition from the neighboring towns. Despite of the limited contribution of tourism industry to the local economy, the town possesses different scenic spots awaiting for development, such as the following:\n\nAll of these mentioned attractions do not have acceptable facilities and utilities except for some native cottages available at the beaches. Most of the identified tourist spots do not have accessibility. Transportation and mobility is one of the major problems that prevents visits from local and foreign visitors.\n\nThere are 2 levels of education present in Madrid namely, elementary and secondary educational level only. Higher education or college school can be availed in Cantilan but most of the local students prefer to study in Cebu or neighboring provinces.\n\nThere are 12 complete elementary schools and 1 primary school in Madrid located in every barangay of the town. Each school varies from one to another in terms of facilities and area of school site. Patong-Patong Elementary School has the largest area of more than 1.7 hectares while Magsaysay Elementary School has less than a half-hectare in area. Madrid Central Elementary School has the most number of school facilities to include shop, library, administrative office, clinic, comfort rooms, playground and science room, while the rest of the elementary schools do have 2 to 3 facilities available.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the household population of more than 10 years old are literate and the prevalence of illiteracy of the town barely reaches 5 percent. For a total of 11,023 population ages more than 5 years old, it was noted that 2.8 percent of the population do not have any grade completed. Another 1.9 percent has completed pre-school and more than 56 percent completed elementary education. There are 25 percent of the populations having high school education and only 48 percent of that completed their high school education. There are 218 individuals who have a post secondary education and only 6 percent of that is still undergrads. There are 763 individuals who are college undergrads while 494 are academic degree holders and only an estimated of 16 individuals who have past baccalaureate as the highest grade completed.\n\nThere are 327 registered births in Madrid for the year 2000 placing the Crude Birth Rate (CBR) at 23 per 1000 population. Using the current population of 14,066 mortality or deaths reported during the year was 90. 40 of which are females and 50 males and 8 of those deaths are infants. No maternal death was reported. CDR (Crude Death Rate) for the year was recorded at 6 per 1,000 population. Leading causes of deaths are Pneumonia, Hypertensive Vascular Diseases, Pulmonary Tuberculosis, Cancer and Accidents. Leading causes of morbidity for the also include Pneumonia, Bronchitis, PTB, Hypertension and Diarrhea.\n\nThere are 9 personnel manning the Municipal Health Office, 1 Physician (Municipal Health Officer), 1 Public Health Nurse, 1 Medical Technologists, 4 Midwives and 2 Sanitary Inspectors. The Municipal Health Office is backed up by the presence of Madrid District Hospital located in the poblacion, which serves as its core referral hospital.\nNutrition - Madrid has a very high incidence of malnutrition in the year 2000 with a prevalence rate of 6.6. Out of the 2,665 preschool children weighed, 20 were severely underweight, 156 moderately underweight and 917 mildly underweight.\n\nThe manner of garbage disposal in the area varies from one barangay to the other. The most common are burning, burying and composting. Ninety percent (90) of the 2,862 households have sanitary toilets of which 6.6 percent are of unsanitary type and 3.4 percent without toilet. Eighty one percent (81%) has access safe water supply while 18.7 percent has doubtful source.\n\n"}

Through a support of several historical accounts, archaeologists and historians believed that the gold items were associated between 10th to 13th century used by pre-colonial Filipinos, years before Spaniards came to the country. Some of the golden artifacts, jewelries and ornaments, dubbed as the \"Surigao Treasures\", were then sold to and currently exhibited at the Ayala Museum in the city of Makati, Philippines and some pieces at the Central Bank of the Philippines. Morales' discoveries were then considered one of the first proofs that gold was an important link between the early people of pre-colonial Philippines and the neighboring Southeast Asian countries.\n\nSan Miguel is politically subdivided into 18 barangays.\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nTago is located in the central part of Surigao del Sur facing the Pacific Ocean. It lies between 126 degrees 12 minutes longitude and 9 degrees minutes north latitude. It is bounded on the north by the Capital Town of Tandag, on the north-west by Municipality of Lanuza, on the west by Municipality of San Miguel, on the southeast by the Municipality of Bayabas and on the south by the Municipalities of Cagwait and Marihatag.\n\nTago sits on a 343.52 km² of land which is about 7.55% of the total area of Surigao del Sur. In terms of area, Barangay Cabangahan is the largest with 20% of Tago’s land area while Barangay Purisima is the smallest with 1.51%.\n\nTago’s soil types vary; along the shoreline is sandy. Barangays Victoria and Dayoan have Bantug clay; Barangays Gamut, Kinabigtasan, Sumo-Sumo, Adlay and Anahao Daan have Butuan clay; while Bajao, Alba, Cayale, Bangsud and Anahao Bag-o have silt loam. Matho clay can be found in most of the mountain ranges from the seashore to the boundaries of Tandag-Tago and Tago-San Miguel.\n\nRoughly 50% of Tago’s land area is relatively flat terrain (0-3%) while roughly 30%, mostly in the north-western portion, are steep mountains.\n\nGenerally, Tago falls under the normal climate with rainy season occurring from November to March and dry season from April to October. The hottest months are July and August. The planting season usually takes place in November to late January.\n\nTago is politically subdivided into 24 barangays.\n\nThe Municipality of Tago was born thrice because of the precariousness of political times back then. It saw the light of day for the first time in 1865 under the Maura Law of the Spanish Regime that lasted for three years. Tago must have reverted to its barrio status because records had it that for the second time, it regained its municipal status on 23 August 1883, just after it transferred from the so-called Daan Lungsod (Old Town), which was perennially flooded, to the place called Laguna. When the Philippine Revolution broke out in 1896, Tago was again reverted to its barrio status.\n\nAbout the middle of the First World War, the people of Tago grew politically minded and in the summer of 1916, important leaders of then Barrio of Tago like Catalino Pareja, Calixtro Espinoza, Simon Luna, Miguel Montero, Juan L. Garcia, Feleciano Arquiza, Juan Pimentel, Lorenzo Elizalde, Canuto Consuegra, Lino Montero, Isidro Garcia, Pastor Cabrera, Bernardo Falcon, Felipe Lozada and Felix Rodrigues were determined to wrestle Tago’s political independence away from the mother Municipality of Tandag.\n\nThis breed of local leaders then submitted a duly signed petition to the Municipal Council of Tandag. But wanting the petition to gain more support, Catalino Pareja, along with councilors Lino Montero, Isidro Garcia and Zacarias Espinoza, sent the resolution directly to the Provincial Board of Surigao which in turn endorsed it to the Governor General in Manila.\n\nThe crude transportation system during that time made the Provincial Governor Ricardo Gonzales incur delays in sending the petition to Governor General Francis Burton Harrison. But faced with numerous pressing matters to attend to, Harrison issued Executive Order No. 41 only on 6 November 1918, thus converting Tago, for the third time, from being a barrio to a newborn town.\n\nAppointed Municipal President effective 1 January 1919 was then Councilor Catalino Pareja with Calixtro Espinoza as Vice Municipal President while Messrs. Feleciano Arquiza, Juan L. Garcia, Lorenzo Elizalde and Canuto Consuegra were appointed as Municipal Councilors. On the same year, the first election was conducted and Catalino Pareja and Lino Montero were elected as Municipal President and Vice Municipal President respectively.\n\nReverend Father Nose Croonin was Tago’s Parish Priest at that time.\n\nDuring much of World War II Tago remained free from Japanese occupation. In late April 1944 the Japanese occupied Tago. The Japanese caused much damage there when their first patrol entered town. In early May guerrillas affiliated with the 10th Military District of the U.S. Army attacked the Japanese. Eight Japanese were killed, but the guerrillas were unable to dislodge them.

It was located in the western part of the Gippsland region, which extends for the length of Victoria's eastern Bass Strait coastline. It included the outer south-eastern Melbourne suburb of Pakenham, and also included the towns of Warragul, Moe, Wonthaggi, Leongatha and Foster. It stretched from Mount Baw Baw and the Baw Baw National Park in the north to Wilsons Promontory, and the Wilsons Promontory National Park in the south. It was the southernmost electoral division in continental Australia. It was replaced by the Division of Monash in 2019.\n\nThe Division was proclaimed at the redistribution of 11 May 1949, and was first contested at the 1949 election. It was named after Angus McMillan, a mass murderer and early European explorer in the Gippsland region responsible for the Gippsland massacres. The seat traded hands between the conservative parties from its creation until Labor finally won it in 1980. The Division has changed hands five times in the last seven Federal elections. The change at the 2004 election was attributed to the redistribution of 29 January 2003, which removed the traditionally Labor-voting cities of Traralgon and Morwell from the Division. This allowed Liberal Russell Broadbent to win the seat once again; he had previously held it from 1996 to 1998. Broadbent was re-elected in the 2007 election.\n\nThe 1972 federal election saw Country Party candidate Arthur Hewson win the seat from third place and a primary vote of 16.6%. This is the lowest primary vote for a winning candidate in any federal election; Hewson overtook the Liberal candidate on preferences from the Democratic Labor Party and disendorsed sitting Liberal MP Alex Buchanan, and then defeated the Labor candidate on Liberal preferences.\n\nThe division was renamed to the Division of Monash in 2018.\n\n"}
{"id": "2156552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156552", "title": "The Deep Blue Good-by", "text": "The Deep Blue Good-by\n\nThe Deep Blue Good-by is the first of 21 novels in the Travis McGee series by American author John D. MacDonald. \n\nCommissioned in 1964 by Fawcett Publications editor Knox Burger, the book establishes for the series an investigative protagonist in a residential Florida base. All titles in the 21-volume series include a color, a mnemonic device which was suggested by his publisher so that when harried travelers in airports looked to buy a book, they could at once see those MacDonald titles they had not yet read. (MacDonald also included color in a further two unrelated novels: \"A Flash of Green\" and \"The Girl, the Gold Watch & Everything\".)\n\nMacDonald was also quoted stating that he considered all the novels in the McGee series as one long story in many installments on the life and times of Travis McGee. As such, \"The Deep Blue Good-by\" is a good starting point for new readers interested in the series. While each of the 21 novels adds more information on the history, background and psyche of McGee, one of the more interesting aspects of the series is seeing him mature, evolve and age through the decades. At the same time, we see the American culture change, from the Kennedy years in \"The Deep Blue Good-bye\" through the upheaval of hippie counterculture and the sexual revolution of the late 60s and 70s until the last book in the series at the end of the Reagan years in the mid-80s. As a chronicler of the cultural zeitgeist, MacDonald has been compared favorably with Charles Dickens. Reading the McGee novels in sequence therefore gives the reader a fascinating experience of seeing McGee change through the decades as American culture also changes.\n\nWhen MacDonald created the character, he was to be called Dallas McGee, after the city, but after the Kennedy assassination he decided that name had too many negative connotations. He was searching for a first name for McGee when a friend suggested that he look at the names of the many Air Force bases in California. MacDonald's attention was caught by Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, and so he named his character Travis.\n\nMcGee first appeared in the 1964 novel The Deep Blue Good-by and was last seen in The Lonely Silver Rain in 1985. In 1980, the McGee novel \"The Green Ripper\" won the National Book Award.\nThe McGee novels feature an ever-changing array of female companions, some particularly nasty villains, exotic locales in Florida, Mexico, and the Caribbean, and appearances by a sidekick known only as \"Meyer,\" a Ph.D. economist of international renown.\n\nAs Sherlock Holmes had his well-known address on Baker Street, McGee had his trademark lodgings on his 52-foot (16 m) houseboat, the Busted Flush, named for the poker hand that started the run of luck in which he won her. She is docked at Slip F-18, Bahia Mar marina, Fort Lauderdale, Florida. McGee also owns a custom vintage Rolls-Royce that had been converted into a pickup truck long before he bought it, and painted \"a horrid electric blue\" by the same hand that did the conversion. McGee named it \"Miss Agnes\", after one of his elementary school teachers whose hair was the same shade.\n\nMcGee's business card reads \"Salvage Consultant\", and most business comes by word of mouth. His clients are usually people who have been deprived of something important and/or valuable (typically by unscrupulous or illegal means) and have no way to regain it lawfully. McGee's usual fee is half the value of the item (if recovered). McGee works when he has to, almost always only taking jobs when his supply of money (kept in an ingenious \"hidey-hole\" aboard the \"Flush\") is low. In one tale, however, McGee avenges the murder of a long-time friend. In another, he is asked by the daughter of a friend to find out why her husband is trying to kill her. While he can be mercenary at times, he is not a mercenary.\n\nPhysically, McGee is a tall, tanned, sandy-haired man with pale grey eyes. Several books hint (or explicitly state) that he is a U.S. Army veteran of the Korean War. However, later books are less precise about exactly when he served. In \"The Green Ripper\", one of the later novels, there are implications that his military service was during the Vietnam War rather than Korea. In \"The Lonely Silver Rain\" he visits a bank safe-deposit box in which he keeps a few precious keepsakes including photos of his father, mother, and brother, \"all long dead,\" and he mentions that the box also contains his Silver Star, Purple Heart, and honorable discharge certificate, all awarded by the U.S. Army to \"Sergeant McGee\". He also has a daughter named Jean, unknown to him until she reveals herself in \"The Lonely Silver Rain\" as the result of a long-ago love affair. He was a stand-out college football player (at tight end) but says in \"A Deadly Shade of Gold\" that he never played professional football due to a knee injury. However, in \"The Turquoise Lament\" he admits to a sports-trivia fan that he played professional football for a couple of seasons before his knees were wrecked in a tackle by an opponent from the Detroit Lions. Psychologically he's an introspective and mysterious person.\n\nDespite his age (unknown), he retains the quickness and agility of a professional athlete. He stands 6'4\" (1.95 m) tall and, although deceptively unimposing at his \"fighting weight\" of 205 lbs. (93 kg), he is much stronger than he looks, with thick wrists and long arms; occasionally, a more perspicacious adversary notes these features when deciding whether to tangle with him. McGee purposely cultivates an image of being uncoordinated, shambling, and clumsy, but has superb reflexes and muscle memory. He has a 33-inch waist, wears a size 46 long jacket, and a shirt with a 17½\" neck and 34\" arms. McGee often discusses his fitness regimen, usually in terms of regaining his fitness after a lazy period: swimming and sprinting are frequently mentioned. At one time he was a pipe smoker, but eventually gave it up in order to maintain his physical fitness. As a martial art strategy, he often covers his face and blocks punches with his arms and elbows to lull and tire his opponent while studying that opponent's fighting style. In the final novel, McGee is described as practicing the Chinese art of T'ai chi ch'uan.\n\nHowever, unlike other fictional detectives such as Raymond Chandler's jaded and world-weary Philip Marlowe, McGee clings to what is important to him: his senses of honor, obligation, and outrage. In a classic commentary in \"Bright Orange for the Shroud\", McGee muses,\n\nNow, of course, having failed in every attempt to subdue the Glades by frontal attack, we are slowly killing it off by tapping the River of Grass. In the questionable name of progress, the state in its vast wisdom lets every two-bit developer divert the flow into drag-lined canals that give him \"waterfront\" lots to sell. As far north as Corkscrew Swamp, virgin stands of ancient bald cypress are dying. All the area north of Copeland had been logged out, and will never come back. As the glades dry, the big fires come with increasing frequency. The ecology is changing with egret colonies dwindling, mullet getting scarce, mangrove dying of new diseases born of dryness.\n\nThis was in a paperback originally published in 1965 when the general public was still not conversant with the concept of environmentalism.\n\n\"The Deep Blue Good-by\" introduces readers to McGee, his place of residence, the \"Busted Flush\" (a houseboat he won in a poker game), and its mooring place, slip F-18 at the Bahia Mar Marina in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In the early chapters we learn that McGee is a bachelor, a man who can be friends with ladies as well as have a passion for them, and a man of principle (although they are somewhat at the mercy of his uncertain emotional condition and his circumstances at the moment; in McGee's own words, \"Some of them I'll bend way, way, over, but not break.\").\n\nAnother feature of the McGee series is the seemingly unending parade of colorful and invariably evil villains whom McGee must contend with in order to make a recovery for his clients. In this first story the antagonist is Junior Allen, a smiling, seemingly friendly man, large, \"cat quick\", powerful, and pathologically evil. The story begins with a fortune smuggled home after World War II by a soldier who was a native of the Florida Keys. This soldier killed another soldier just prior to his discharge, went on the run back to the Keys, and buried his treasure there. He was later captured by the U.S. Army and sent to a military prison, where he met Junior Allen. Allen discovered vague details about the fortune hidden in the Keys and after his release from prison went there to find it. The story depicts the psychotic behavior of Allen as he evolves from thief to serial rapist to murderer. We see McGee's savvy, guile, and physical prowess as he works methodically to locate Allen and eventually make the recovery. As is thematic in many of the McGee books, however, he pays a heavy price for the successful recovery. Throughout the series, in fact, it is debatable as to whether McGee ever makes a recovery in which the gain outweighs the costs.\n\nThe \"Deep Blue Good-by\" occurs when some of the blue gem stones that McGee is trying to recover are spilled on a boat during a scuffle with Junior Allen and fall to the bottom of the ocean. The title phrase is not used in this book, although all of the book phrases are used starting in his third book, \"A Purple Place for Dying.\" \n\nIn the end, Travis McGee recovered five gem stones for about $22,668. McGee took $1,668 for expenses and $1,000 as a recovery fee from Cathy Kerr.\n\nWhen Travis McGee arrived on the big screen in 1970 with \"Darker Than Amber\", starring Rod Taylor, the film received favorable reviews from Roger Ebert and other critics, but the film did not develop into a series. Other actors considered for the role were Jack Lord and Robert Culp. John McDonald's favourites were Steve McQueen or Vic Morrow.\nThe 1983 TV movie \"Travis McGee: The Empty Copper Sea\" starred Sam Elliott. It relocated McGee to California, abandoning the Florida locales central to the novel.\n\nIn 1967, author MacDonald refused permission for a television series about Travis McGee, believing that people would stop reading the novels were Travis McGee regularly on television.\n\nA film version of \"The Deep Blue Good-by\", directed by Oliver Stone with Leonardo DiCaprio as Travis McGee, was in development with a tentative release date of 2011 or 2012. In April 2010, it was announced that the film's title was changed to \"Travis McGee\". In April 2011, it was announced that Paul Greengrass was interested in directing the film. As of February 2014, this has not materialized and the film remains listed as in development. On March 4, 2014, James Mangold was attached to direct the film which DiCaprio will produce with Jennifer Davisson-Killoran and Amy Robinson. Dana Stevens and Kario Salem wrote the first draft. On July 15, Christian Bale was attached to play the title role for the film \"The Deep Blue Good-by\" with screenplay by Dennis Lehane. On February 25, 2015, it was reported that Rosamund Pike had landed the female lead in the film. On August 24, the production was shelved due to Bale's knee injury.\n"}

The \"lightweight\" in LMAP essentially stands for \"no crypto\", as opposed to DomainKeys and its successor, DKIM. In March 2004, the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF held a BoF on these proposals. As the result of that meeting, the task force chartered the MARID working group.\n\nMicrosoft's Caller-ID proposal was a late and highly controversial addition to this mix. It came with the following features:\n\n\nThe working group decided to postpone the question of RFC 2821 SMTP identities - i.e. MAIL FROM covered by SPF, or HELO covered by CSV and SPF - in favour of RFC 2822 identities covered by Caller-ID's and later Sender-ID's Purported Responsible Address (PRA). The WG arrived at a point where sender policies could be split into different \"scopes\", like the 2821 MAIL FROM or the 2822 PRA. The MARID spf2.0 syntax also allowed to join different \"scopes\" into one policy record, if the sets of \"permitted IPs\" are identical, as is often the case.\n\nLess than a week after the publication of a first mfrom or MAIL FROM draft, the WG was terminated unilaterally by its leadership. MARID existed only seven months, and no RFCs were published.\n\nThe responsible IETF Area Director agreed to sponsor the publication of some of the unfinished MARID discussions as IETF experiments; these happened in 2005, as both the pre-MARID SPF and Sender ID were approved as experimental RFCs. The latter is to a certain degree a result of MARID, growing out of the Caller-ID proposal.\n\nThe ongoing disputes on technical issues and incompatibilities in Sender ID resulted later in appeals to the IESG and the IAB.\n\n"}

A bun can be secured with a hair tie, barrette, bobby pins, one or more hair sticks, a hairnet, or a pen or pencil. Hair may also be wrapped around a piece called a \"rat\". Alternatively, hair bun inserts, or sometimes rolled up socks, may also be used to create donut-shaped buns. Buns may be tightly gathered, or loose and more informal.\n\nDouble or pigtail buns are often called , which is also a type of Japanese dumpling (usually called \"dango;\" the \"o-\" is honorific).\n\nThe term was popularized by the anime and manga series \"Sailor Moon\", whose eponymous heroine and other characters wear their hair in this style. The term \"odango\" in Japanese can refer to any variety of bun hairstyle.\n\nIn China, the hairstyle is called niújiǎotóu (牛角头). It was a commonly used hairstyle up until the early 20th century, and can still be seen today when traditional attire is used. This hairstyle differs from the odango slightly in that it is gender neutral; Chinese paintings of children have frequently depicted girls as having matching ox horns, while boys have a single bun in the back.\n\n\"\" had Rey debut a \"triple bun\" hairstyle.\n\nMen in China wore their hair in a topknot bun as early as 200BC as depicted on the terracotta soldiers. They were worn until the end of the Ming Dynasty in AD 1644, after which the Qing Dynasty government forced Han Chinese to adopt the queue hairstyle (queue order).\n\nMen of the Joseon Era of Korea wore the sangtu as a symbol of marriage. 16th century Japanese men wore the chonmage for samurai warriors and sumo wrestlers. In the west, topknots were frequently worn by \"barbarian\" peoples in the eyes of the Romans, such as the Goths, Vandals, and most importantly, the Lombards. Later, the hairstyle survived in the pagan Scandinavian north (some believe the topknot hairstyle contains elements of Odinic cult worship) and with the eastern nomadic tribes such as the Bulgars, Cumans and Cossacks. Paul the Deacon, in his description of the traditional barbarian style of the Lombard nation, describes their hair thus so, \"they uncovered the flesh of their heads by shaving all around the neck, sides, and back of the head until the nuchal zone. The hair on the top, left long, was parted in the middle and hung down to the corners of their mouths.\" (HL IV.22). This perfectly describes the modern western top knot as it appears untied.\n\nHistorical and iconic examples of men with long hair using this style as practicality include:\n\nThe rishi knot is a topknot worn by Sikh boys and men as a religious practice, in which the hair is formed into a bun. In the Sikh tradition, a turban is then worn atop the bun. This hairstyle is also known as \"joora\", and was traditionally worn by Hindu monks known as rishis.\n\nThe man-bun is a topknot worn by long-haired men in the Western world who do not wish to sport the traditional trend of short back and sides. In London, the modern man bun style may have begun around 2010 although David Beckham sported one earlier. The first Google Trends examples started to appear in 2013, and searches showed a steep increase through 2015. Some of the first celebrities to wear the style were Jared Leto, Joakim Noah, Chris Hemsworth, Leonardo DiCaprio and Orlando Bloom. The hairstyle is also associated with Brooklyn hipsters.\n\n\n"}

The tour was formed in 2006, as the successor to the Indian PGA Golf Tour, which ran from 1997 to 2006.\n\nThe PGTI serves as a feeder tour for higher level tours such as the Asian Tour. Many Indian players have become members of the Asian Tour, while a small number have joined the world's leading two tours, the European Tour and the United States-based PGA Tour.\n\nThe PGTI became a member of the International Federation of PGA Tours in 2009, but its events do not carry World Ranking Points unless they are co-sanctioned by tours that are included in the world ranking system. In July 2018, the OWGR announced that the PGTI would receive world ranking points in its own right starting in 2019, awarding five points for a 72-hole event.\n\nIndia's Royal Calcutta Golf Club was founded in 1829 and is usually regarded as the oldest outside the United Kingdom. In the early years Indian golf with dominated by British players and it was not until 1949 that Mohinder Bal became the first Indian to win the All-India Amateur Championship. The Indian Golf Union (IGU) was founded in 1955 to take over responsibility for Indian Golf, which had previously been largely in the hands of the Royal Calcutta Golf Club. The sport was still dominated by amateurs at that point, but most of them were now Indian.\n\nIn 1957 the IGU started a training program for caddies and professionals. In 1964 the Indian Open (open that is to both amateurs and professionals), was established and it soon replaced the All-India Amateur as the leading golf tournament in the country. Australian and five time British Open champion Peter Thomson used to stop over in India on his way from Australia to Europe, and he won the Indian Open in 1964, 1966 and 1976. Major Billoo Sethi, an amateur, was the first Indian to win this tournament in 1965. In 1970 the Indian Open became part of the Asian Golf Circuit, the predecessor of the Asian Tour. In 1991 Ali Sher a professional golfer won the Indian Open, which made professional golf a much more attractive career option in India.\n\nThe Professional Golfers Association of India was founded in 1988, and several additional professional events were founded in India in the 1990s. From 1997 to 2006, the Indian Golf Tour was managed by Tiger Sports Marketing on behalf of the PGA of India. Total prize money for the 2004/05 season was 30,500,000 Indian rupees ($698,260 at 31 December 2004 exchange rate). There were around 20 events in the season, including tournaments in Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.\n\nIn October 2006 a group of leading Indian golfers including Jyoti Randhawa and Gaurav Ghei announced that they were setting up a new tour. This followed a dispute between the Professional Golfers Association of India and Tiger Sports Marketing, the organisers of the Indian Golf Tour. The BBC reported that it was not clear whether this tour would simply take the place of the existing tour, or whether rival tours might develop. In the event, the new tour, the Professional Golf Tour of India, took over as India's sole domestic professional tour, though Tiger Sports Marketing remained involved in other aspects of Indian golf.\n\nThe PGTI's schedule expanded rapidly in its first few seasons. In 2010 there were twenty-five events on the main schedule, including two co-sanctioned with the Asian Tour and one co-sanctioned with the European Tour, plus seven events on the Feeder Tour, which debuted that year. In 2011 the tour will co-sanction an event with the European Tour's developmental circuit, the Challenge Tour, for the first time.\n\nIn the ongoing power struggle between the Asian Tour and OneAsia for control of men's professional tournament golf in Asia, the PGTI has so far leant towards the former. The PGTI's president, Gautam Thapar, became a member of the Asian Tour's board in 2009, and as of 2011 India has not hosted any OneAsia events.\n"}

In 2004 he appeared in the film version of Wataya Risa's novel \"Insutooru\", and in 2005, he played an Edo period recovering drug addict in the absurdly comical film \"Mayonaka no Yaji-san Kita-san\", based on a comic book.\n\nNakamura was arrested in January 2005 in Tokyo's Bunkyō-ku for punching a police officer after a taxi driver claimed he did not pay his fare while intoxicated in what could be the first arrest of a kabuki actor since the arrest of Ichikawa Gonjūrō for a murder charge in 1871. The subsequent controversy after the arrest barred Nakamura from participating in the celebration of his father's \"shūmei\" (naming ceremony) in March 2005.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Together the Canadian Council of Churches represents more than 85% of the Christians in Canada. The Canadian Council of Churches was founded in 1944.\n\nThere are now 25 member churches in the Canadian Council of Churches:\n\nAffiliate Members:\n\nThe Council, with headquarters in Toronto, is governed and supported by its members through a semi-annual Governing Board. The current General Secretary of the Council is the Rev. Dr. Karen Hamilton. Officers and staff of the Council are drawn from the whole diversity of traditions represented by the member churches. Two commissions coordinate a large portion of its work: \"Justice and Peace\" and \"Faith and Witness\".\n\nThe Commission on Justice and Peace provides a forum for sharing information and concerns among those involved in ecumenical work on peace and social justice in Canada and the world. It facilitates biblical and theological reflection on peace and social justice and cooperation of the churches on related concerns. Some of the key issues with which this commission is concerned include Peace and Disarmament, Faith and the Economy, Poverty in Canada, HIV/AIDS, Undoing Racism, Human Trafficking in Canada, Strengthening Public Health Care in Canada, and Canada's Role in Afghanistan, as well as ongoing discussions on human rights and just peacemaking.\n\nThe purpose of the Commission on Faith and Witness is to provide a meeting-place and a lively and fertile ground for reflection and work among Christians of different families. Together, the various denominations represented work to reflect theologically on matters of concern in the present day, and on questions of historical interest to the churches. They also periodically publish resources on topics chosen by the churches, such as The Bruised Reed: Christian Reflections on Suffering and Hope (2010), as well as coordinating the churches' participation in interfaith dialogue, with involvement on the Canadian Christian Jewish Consultation and National Muslim Christian Liaison Committee, among other bodies. Each member church provides at least one representative to the Commission. Topics that are explored by this commission include baptism, marriage, euthanasia, and Christian perspectives on suffering and hope.\n\nThrough the ecumenical movement, which arose in Canada in the twentieth century, the Canadian Council of Churches seeks unity for the divided church and seeks to remind Christians that they share Christ's mission for reconciliation, peace, dignity and justice for the whole community.\n\nSome of the work done by the Council and the Member Churches working together includes:\n\n\nThe Canadian Council of Churches is registered with the United Nations and participates in world conferences and commissions on such issues as funding for development, refugee settlement and human rights. The Council is also a participant in the annual World Religious Leaders Summit, in parallel with the G8/G20 political summits each year. In 2010, the Council also provided leadership for this event, when the international summit was hosted by Canada in Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group. WTVC's studios are located on Benton Drive in Chattanooga, and its transmitter is located on Signal Mountain in the town of Walden. \n\nSinclair also manages Chattanooga-licensed This TV affiliate/Comet-operated station WDSI-TV, channel 61 (owned by New Age Media) and Cleveland-licensed CW/MyNetworkTV/MeTV affiliate WFLI-TV, channel 53 (owned by MPS Media) under a master service agreement. WDSI and WFLI maintain separate facilities on East Main Street (SR 8/US 41/US 76) in Chattanooga's Highland Park section; master control and some internal operations for the two stations are based at WTVC's studios.\n\nIn addition to its main digital signal, WTVC can be seen off-air on a low-powered Class A repeater, WPDP-CD (virtual channel 25, UHF digital channel 33). Licensed to Cleveland and owned by New Age Media, this station has a transmitter on Oswald Dome in unincorporated Polk County (northeast of Benton) in the Cherokee National Forest.\n\nOn Comcast Xfinity cable systems, WTVC is available on channels 10 and 431, while WTVC-DT2 is carried on channels 11 and 434. EPB Fiber Optics carries WTVC on channels 9 and 309 and WTVC-DT2 on channels 7 and 307. Although parts of the Chattanooga market are in the Central Time Zone, all schedules are listed in Eastern Time.\n\nThe station signed on-the-air in 1953 as WROM-TV, an NBC affiliate licensed to Rome, Georgia, with signal coverage that originally favored Chattanooga. It transmitted a full-powered analog signal on VHF channel 9 at 316,000 watts from a tower on Horseleg Mountain west of Rome. WROM-TV also had secondary affiliations with CBS, ABC, and the DuMont Television Network. The station lost CBS when WDEF-TV signed on in 1954. WROM-TV then carried NBC, ABC, and DuMont until 1956 when Dumont went off-the-air and WRGP-TV (now WRCB-TV) signed on and took the NBC affiliation. At that time, ABC opted to end its affiliate relationship with WROM-TV and secure secondary affiliations with WDEF and WRGP because WROM-TV's low-power signal only reached the south suburbs of Chattanooga.\n\nWROM-TV continued as an independent station until late 1957. During its tenure as a Rome station, it claimed to be \"Dixie's Largest Independent.\" The station ran a late-afternoon and prime-time schedule of old movies, \"hillbilly\" music performances (which were common on Southern TV stations in the 1950s) and occasionally, ABC TV network fare such as \"Omnibus\".\n\nMartin Theaters (forerunner of Carmike Cinemas) bought the station in 1957 and in December of that year, took it off the air to move the transmitter north to Chattanooga. Martin Theaters had petitioned the FCC for permission to move WTVM in Columbus, Georgia to channel 9. However, FCC rules mandated a certain amount of separation for stations on the same channel, and WROM provided a strong grade B signal to Columbus. The FCC normally did not allow common ownership of two stations with overlapping signals, and found that the overlap between WROM and WTVM would have been too great. The move to Chattanooga by WROM-TV satisfied the co-channel restriction.\n\nThe Chattanooga-Columbus channel reallocation was part of the last huge FCC national analog channel reallocation that saw stations in the Southeast switch frequencies not only in Chattanooga and Columbus, but also in Dothan and Montgomery, Alabama; Greenwood, Tupelo, and Laurel, Mississippi; Florence, South Carolina and High Point, North Carolina.\n\nIronically, Rome lost a second television frequency 40 years later, when WZGA (UHF channel 14, now Ion Television O&O WPXA-TV) moved its operations to Atlanta after several years of operation. However, unlike WROM-TV, channel 14 still has its license in Rome. WROM is still on the air on AM 710. WPXA (now carried on digital channel 31, but still virtually mapped to 14) is still licensed to Rome, while a digital fill-in translator for WSB-TV from Atlanta is licensed to Rome on digital channel 14, but mapped virtually to channel 2.\n\nChannel 9 returned to full-power as ABC affiliate WTVC in Chattanooga on February 11, 1958. It still operates under the original license for WROM-TV. Chattanooga also became one of the smallest television markets in the country to have three VHF stations. WTVC is the only station in Chattanooga to have never had a secondary affiliation with another network.\n\nWTVC developed a strong reputation for local programming in its early years. Among the shows that WTVC pioneered was the children's educational show \"Funtime\" with Marcia Kling. \"Shock Theater\" which aired on Saturday nights developed a cult following with WTVC Programming Director Tommy Reynolds dressed up as Dracula with the moniker \"Doctor Shock\" alongside his irreverent sidekick \"Dingbat\". \"The Bob Brandy Show\" which aired in the afternoons featured cartoons and kids activities hosted by WTVC advertising executive Bob Brandy, his wife Ingrid, and their horse Rebel.\n\nIn 1969, Martin Theaters was sold to Augusta, Georgia businessman J.B. Fuqua. Fuqua also owned WJBF-TV in Augusta, WTVW in Evansville, Indiana, and KTHI-TV (now KVLY-TV) in Fargo, North Dakota. Over the next few years each station was sold with WTVC being purchased in 1980 by the Belo Corporation of Dallas, Texas. In 1984, Freedom Communications bought the station along with KFDM in Beaumont, marking the newspaper chain's second television acquisition. Belo put WTVC and KFDM on the market after it announced plans to purchase Corinthian Broadcasting from Dun & Bradstreet so that the company could comply with the FCC-mandated ownership limit of five VHF television stations which was in effect at the time.\n\nWhen WTVC moved its operations to Chattanooga, it opened a studio near its transmitter on Signal Mountain. In 1960, it moved to new facilities in the Golden Gateway Shopping Center in downtown Chattanooga next to a Zayre department store. Over the years, however, the station outgrew the building. In January 2000, WTVC moved into new digitally-equipped studios located adjacent to the Highway 58 / Highway 153 interchange.\n\nFreedom announced on November 2, 2011 that it would bow out of television and sell its stations, including WTVC, to Sinclair Broadcast Group. The group deal closed on April 2, 2012.\n\nFollowing the purchase of non-license assets from Fox affiliate WDSI-TV by Sinclair, its Fox affiliation and programming moved to WTVC's second digital subchannel.\n\nDuring a transition process that was completed on October 31, 2015, WTVC's second digital channel simulcast WDSI. On that date, when Sinclair launched their new network Comet, the Fox schedule and the intellectual unit for WDSI's main signal moved permanently to WTVC-DT2 under the on-air moniker Fox Chattanooga. The programming on This TV which had been on WTVC-DT2 moved to WDSI's main signal, with Comet launching on WDSI-DT2; the MyNetworkTV subchannel was moved to WFLI-DT2, with the MeTV signal which had been carried on that slot moved to WFLI-DT3. Cable, satellite, and EPB viewers saw no change in any channel slots, as WTVC-DT2 took over the former channel slots for WDSI's main signal.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nOn December 16, 2014, WTVC added a 24/7 local weather channel, affiliated with WeatherNation TV on digital channel 9.3. WeatherNation was dropped in favor of TBD Network on June 1, 2017.\n\nWTVC shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 9, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 35 to VHF channel 9 for post-transition operations.\n\nCurrently, WTVC airs 33½ hours of news each week (with 5½ hours each weekday and three hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). In the event of special sports coverage overlapping news time, the station streams a live newscast on its website. The station also airs a public affairs show, \"This-N-That\". Longtime personality Don Welch hosted the show until his retirement in 2014. James Howard now hosts the show that airs at 12:30 weekdays, which has a weather segment and news updates whenever necessary.\n\nThrough the late-1960s and mid-1970s, WTVC branded its newscasts under the \"Eyewitness News\" label. In 1975, this switched to \"Action News\". In the late-1980s, it was one of the first stations in the country to adopt the \"NewsChannel\" branding.\n\nIn the early 1990s, WTVC produced a 10 p.m. newscast for then-independent WFLI-TV but that was eventually cancelled. In 1994, the station began airing a nightly 10 o'clock broadcast on Fox affiliate WDSI-TV using station meteorologists, sports anchors, news reporters and news video, while WDSI provided separate news anchors. In 2000, that station launched its own news department and aired local news on weekday mornings, weekday afternoons at 4, and nightly at 10. In 2004, the news department at WDSI closed down and a news share agreement with WTVC was re-established. Since then, this station has been producing \"Fox 61 First at 10\" on WDSI. With the acquisition of WDSI-TV's non-license assets and Fox programming, the 10 p.m. newscast is now branded \"First at 10 on Fox Chattanooga\".\n\nFrom the 1960s through the 1970s, WTVC newscasts were usually in last place, but it was not until new owners Belo took over, that the ratings began to favor WTVC. Since the mid-1980s, WTVC had waged a spirited battle with WRCB for first place in the local news ratings weekdays, while WDEF has usually trailed both stations. On March 1, 2014, WTVC launched the area's second-only weekend morning newscast. Named \"Good Morning Chattanooga Weekend\", the broadcasts air from 6:00-7:00 and from 8:00-9:00 a.m. The weekend editions of \"Good Morning America\" are aired between the newscasts at 7:00 a.m.\n\n"}

{"id": "2156600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156600", "title": "Rikki Clarke", "text": "Rikki Clarke\n\nRikki Clarke (born 29 September 1981) is an English cricketer, currently playing for Surrey. He was educated at Broadwater School and then Godalming College. Clarke began his career as a professional cricketer with Surrey in 2000, making his list A debut in 2001 and First Class debut in 2002, and the following year made his One Day International debut for England; later in 2003 he played his first Test match. Between 2003 and 2006 he played two Tests, both against Bangladesh and 20 ODIs. At the end of 2007 Clarke left Surrey to become Derbyshire's club captain after feeling a change was needed, hoping he could impress the England selectors with his leadership. Before the end of the 2008 season he stepped down as captain because the job was negatively affecting his own performance, and after a single year at the club he left to join Warwickshire for the start of the 2009 season.\n\nAfter some fine performances in Surrey's championship-winning Second XI team in 2001, Clarke quickly established himself in the first team the following season. He made an unbeaten 107 against Cambridge UCCE in his debut first-class innings and also scored 153 not out against Somerset, ending the season 711 runs at an average of over 50. He was awarded the Cricket Writers' Club's Young Cricketer of the Year award and the NBC Denis Compton Award for his achievements in 2002.\n\nHis domestic form suffered in 2004 as he could manage a first-class batting average of only 31.17 and just nine wickets all season. His one-day performances were even worse, as he passed fifty just once in 11 innings. In a 50 overs a side match played on 29 April Clarke hit 82 runs off only 28 balls. It included 9 Fours and 6 Sixes. It helped Surrey get to 494–5 against Gloucestershire.\n\nIn 2006 Clarke was made the club's vice-captain, with the aim of giving him some experience of leadership to prepare him to take over the captaincy from Mark Butcher, and later that year he led Surrey in the Twenty20 Cup. In May the England Cricket Board named a 25-man development squad for international players and those considered close to playing for England; Clarke was included in the squad for the first time. Despite his inclusion he was overlooked by England during the summer while players from outside the squad were drafted in to play for England's struggling ODI side. In the 2007 season, Clarke played only ten first-class matches for Surrey, scoring 301 runs and taking 15 wickets.\n\nIn October 2007, it was announced Clarke had signed for second division Derbyshire as captain for the 2008 season, after having attracted offers from a number of clubs. The move came after Clarke turned down a 2-year extension with Surrey with him feeling a change was needed. Clarke said of the move:\n\nClarke hoped that the move to Derbyshire would improve his chance of being selected for England. Despite Clarke's high hopes, he experienced a poor run of form in the 2008 season that led to him quitting the captaincy. When he made his decision, he was averaging 21 with the bat and 38 with the ball from eight first-class matches. The only first-class half century of his tenure as captain was a score of 81 against Warwickshire in May. At one point, his form was so bad that he dropped himself.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful year at Derbyshire, Clarke signed a three-year deal with Warwickshire in September 2008. Warwickshire had been interested in Clarke for a long time and Ashley Giles, the club's director of cricket, said:\n\nAt the end of the 2008 season, Warwickshire secured promotion to the first division of the County Championship. Clarke came into prominence in a game in late April 2009 against Hampshire at Edgbaston. Clarke took 2/63 in the Hampshire first innings, and then went on to score a lusty 112 from 86 balls in a Warwickshire reply of 630/8 declared. During a match against Kent in May 2010, Clarke took his first ever five-wicket haul in first-class cricket, taking 6/63. Playing in 15 County Championship matches that season, Clarke took 32 wickets at an average of 23.21, and managed 673 runs at average of 29.26 with one century.\n\nIn a County Championship match in April 2011 Clarke took the second five-wicket haul of his first-class career, taking 5/10 in the second innings as Warwickshire bowled out Somerset for 50 runs to complete an innings victory. Later that year Warwickshire awarded Clarke his cap. During a County Championship fixture against Lancashire in August, Clarke took nine catches, equalling the record held by Wally Hammond for most catches in a match by a non-wicketkeeper. Clarke's contract with the club was due to expire at the end of the season, and Sussex took the opportunity to approach Clarke and offer him a contract. Though Warwickshire had offered him a new two-year deal it was expected that he would join Sussex, where he would bat higher up the order in one-day matches, though he turned down their offer in September. Soon after he struck his only first-class century of the season, managing 126 runs off 101 balls against Nottinghamshire. He finished the season with 558 runs from 15 matches at an average of 26.57, and aside from his hundred against Nottinghamshire towards the end of the season scored two half-centuries.\n\nClarke scored a century against Lancashire in the 2012 County Championship; coming in to bat with the score on 81/7, Clarke built a partnership of 224 runs with Darren Maddy, four runs short of Warwickshire's record for the 8th wicket.\n\nSome more good performances in the early part of 2003 brought Clarke his England debut, for the One Day International against Pakistan at Old Trafford. Although he took a wicket with his first ball in ODIs (the first Englishman to achieve this feat for three decades) he had a poor match overall, being bowled behind his legs for a duck after playing a totally misjudged sweep and conceding 41 runs from his 7.2 overs. He was retained for the rest of the summer's ODIs despite a total of just three wickets and a high score of only 37.\n\nA groin injury to Andrew Flintoff led to Clarke being drafted into the squad for the 2003/04 tour of Bangladesh and on this tour he made his Test debut, at Dhaka. An undistinguished match was followed by a better performance at Chittagong where he made 55 in the first innings and a quickfire 27 from 16 balls in the second helped set up England's match-winning declaration. He also picked up three wickets, returning a notable analysis of 7–4–7–2 in the Bangladeshis' first innings. He played in only the first of the ODIs against Sri Lanka, a disastrous ten-wicket defeat, and was not selected for any other international games on that tour.\n\nAt the end of that winter, England toured the West Indies, and Clarke was picked for five of the seven ODIs. He failed completely, not reaching double figures in any of his four innings and taking 3–108 from the 18 overs he was allowed. By the time the tour finally finished in early May, Clarke's international career looked in serious jeopardy, but he was given one more chance by injuries to Flintoff and Marcus Trescothick early in the summer of 2004. Clarke was included for the Leeds ODI against the West Indians, but another failure (conceding 30 runs from four overs) followed, and the selectors had seen enough: Clarke was dropped and has not played for England since.\n\nHe enjoyed a better 2005, however, and earned a trip to the Academy.\n\nHowever, in 2006 his luck changed. After averaging 64.66 (including a career best 214) he was drafted into England's one-day squad to play Pakistan. Despite a decent 39 in difficult conditions at Lords he failed with the bat only scoring 45 runs in 3 matches. Like in the West Indies he bowled poorly, overall conceding 64 runs of 10.5 overs with only 1 wicket. He was included in the 2006 Champions Trophy but did not play. He also failed to make the England 'A' tour.\n\nThought to be a big talent, Clarke has so far failed to perform to the level expected by his admirers.\n"}
{"id": "2156608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156608", "title": "Rodney Bewes", "text": "Rodney Bewes\n\nRodney Bewes (27 November 1937 – 21 November 2017) was an English television actor and writer who portrayed Bob Ferris in the BBC television sitcom \"The Likely Lads\" (1964–66) and its colour sequel \"Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?\" (1973–74). Bewes' later career was of a much lower profile, but he continued to work as a stage actor.\n\nBewes was born in Bingley in the West Riding of Yorkshire, to Horace, an Eastern Electricity Board showroom clerk, and Bessie, who was a teacher of children with learning difficulties. His family lived for a few years in the Crossflatts district of Bingley, before they moved to Luton, where he attended Stopsley Secondary School. Because of his early ill-health (he suffered from asthma and bronchitis), one of the reasons the family moved, his mother tended to keep him off school. His illness receded, and the family eventually returned to the north.\n\nHaving seen an advertisement in the \"Daily Herald\", Bewes auditioned for the title role in \"Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School\" just before he turned 13, and was in the last two short-listed for the role, losing to Gerald Campion. However, he did appear in two early television roles for the BBC, \"Mystery at Mountcliffe Chase\" and \"The Pickwick Papers\" (both 1952). At 14, he moved to London to attend RADA's preparatory school.\n\nAfter two years of national service in the RAF, Bewes attended RADA. He was working nights in hotels, doing the washing-up, to finance his studies at RADA during the day, and hence was frequently to be found asleep in class. He was expelled during his final year.\n\nBewes began appearing in repertory theatre and obtained parts in the television drama series \"Dixon of Dock Green\" (1962) and \"Z-Cars\" (1963). He also appeared in the film version of \"Billy Liar\" (1963) as Arthur Crabtree, alongside his close friend Tom Courtenay. The two men shared a flat at the time; Bewes, having seen Courtenay's script, independently and successfully approached the casting director for the part. The following year his northern working-class background and natural northern accent stood him in good stead, landing him the role of Bob Ferris in \"The Likely Lads\" (1964–66) after Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais had seen him in \"Billy Liar\".\n\nIn \"The Likely Lads\" Ferris was the more ambitious of two Newcastle factory workers, with Terry Collier (James Bolam) being his lazy and more cynical friend. The series, at first broadcast on the newly launched BBC2, proved successful both critically and in the ratings when it was shown on the BBC1 and ran for three series. Between his two spells as a 'Likely Lad', Bewes also appeared in \"Man in a Suitcase\" (1967), \"Father, Dear Father\" (1968) and as \"Mr Rodney\" on \"The Basil Brush Show\" (1968–69). He starred in his own ITV sitcom \"Dear Mother...Love Albert\" (later known as \"Albert!\", 1969–72), which he created and co-wrote with Derrick Goodwin.\n\nBewes appeared in the 1969 theatrical production of \"She Stoops to Conquer\" as Tony Lumpkin. He also appeared in the film \"Spring and Port Wine\" (1970) which starred James Mason, and played the Knave of Hearts in \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" (1972). Bewes and Bolam reunited for the sequel that continued the Bob and Terry saga, \"Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?\" (1973–74), which by common consent surpassed the original. It ran for two series of 13 episodes, followed by a Christmas special in 1974. The original series was adapted for radio (1967–68) as was the sequel (1975), and a cinema spin-off (\"The Likely Lads\", 1976) also followed.\n\nBewes' later film roles included \"Jabberwocky\" (1977), \"Unidentified Flying Oddball\" (1979) and \"The Wildcats of St Trinian's\" (1980). Although better known for his comedy and light entertainment roles, viewers were given an opportunity to see Bewes' serious acting ability in a made-for-TV film adaptation of John Ford's 17th century play, \"'Tis Pity She's a Whore\" (1980). Despite a guest role in the \"Doctor Who\" serial \"Resurrection of the Daleks\" in 1984, his television career had largely ended by the mid-1980s.\n\nOn the West End stage, Bewes appeared in the play \"Middle-Age Spread\" and \"Funny Money\", a farce by Ray Cooney.\n\nIn 1981, he starred in \"A Very Private Man\" on BBC Radio. During 1982, he served as spokesman for the now defunct trade organisation the British Onion Marketing Board, appearing in a number of print advertisements during the year.\n\nBewes remained active as a stage performer in the 1990s and later with one-man versions of \"Three Men in a Boat\" and \"Diary of a Nobody\", both of which shows he toured extensively in the UK. \n\nBewes final appearance on television was in 2009 when he played retired bank manager Edward Walton in the \"Heartbeat\" episode \"Ties That Bind.\"\n\nIn July 2013, he was The Marshal (Philippe Pétain) in the Southwark Playhouse production of Peter Ustinov's \"The Moment of Truth\". He was back in Edinburgh again in 2015 for an autobiographical show, \"An Audience with Rodney Bewes... Who?\"\n\nBewes' autobiography, \"A Likely Story\", was published in September 2005. In the autobiography, and on Michael Parkinson's BBC Radio 2 show in 2005, he stated that his \"Likely Lads\" co-star James Bolam had not spoken to him for the past 30 years. It had been assumed for years that Bolam and Bewes were friends off-screen as well as on; a pretence they kept up because their public expected it. However, they had comprehensively fallen out when Bewes indiscreetly related a personal anecdote about Bolam in a 1976 press interview, and had not spoken since. He blamed Bolam's fear of having his privacy invaded, and of being eternally typecast, leading to his refusing to allow repeats of \"The Likely Lads\". The final breach, said Bewes, occurred when, having told an anecdote about the birth of his own triplets, he followed on with a story of how Bolam's wife, Sue, had told him she was pregnant while he was driving, and he almost crashed the car. Bewes repeated this story, thinking it was already public knowledge; but then, on realising he might have crossed a line, phoned Bolam to forewarn him of the article, and got a frosty reaction. \"There was this dreadful silence. He put the phone down. I called him back, he didn't answer. He hasn't spoken to me since.\"\n\nIn 2010, Bewes also complained about his former co-star's refusal to allow \"The Likely Lads\" to be repeated on network television (both must give approval), preventing him earning anything from the repeats; \"he must be very wealthy; me, I've just got an overdraft and a mortgage\". Shortly before he died, in an interview with the \"Daily Mirror\", Bewes once more lamented the loss of his friendship with Bolam. Bolam, however, denied such a rift ever existed, stating after Bewes' death that they \"didn't talk for 40 years because of their busy schedules rather than resentment\", and he had \"nothing but fond memories\" of Bewes.\n\nBewes died on 21 November 2017, six days before his 80th birthday, in his seaside home at Cadgwith in Cornwall.

Malmö FF are the holders of the record of most titles with 20 Swedish championships. After winning the 2017 Allsvenskan, Malmö FF are also the reigning Swedish football champions. The title has been contested since 1896 in varying forms of competition. The first Swedish Champions, Örgryte IS, were declared in 1896 when the club won the cup tournament Svenska Mästerskapet. This happened before there existed any Swedish national association, which was not created until 1904. The winners of Svenska Mästerskapet between 1896 and 1904 have retroactively been declared holders of the title by the Swedish Football Association (SvFF). After the creation of the SvFF, the title continued to be held by the winners of Svenska Mästerskapet until 1925, even though a Swedish first national league, Svenska Serien, started in 1910. Svenska Mästerskapet was discontinued in 1925.\n\nIn 1924–25, a new Swedish national league was created, Allsvenskan, but the Swedish Champions title wasn't awarded to the winners of that league until 1930–31. Since then, the winners of Allsvenskan are considered Swedish Champions, with a few exceptions. Between 1982 and 1990, the title was given to the winners of a play-off held after Allsvenskan was finished, and the following two years, 1991 and 1992, the title was given to the winners of Mästerskapsserien, a continuation league with the best teams from Allsvenskan.\n\nThe current trophy, Lennart Johanssons Pokal, has been awarded since 2001 with Hammarby IF being the first winners. Johansson himself handed out the trophy in Sundsvall on 27 October 2001. The first trophy which was in use from 1904 to 2000 was named von Rosen's Pokal after the first chairman of the Swedish FA Clarence von Rosen. However, in November 2000 it was discovered that von Rosen had been active in the Swedish national socialist movement during World War II which prompted the FA to give up using the old trophy.\n\nA total of 19 clubs have been crowned Swedish champions from Örgryte IS in 1896 until Malmö FF in 2017. A total of 117 Swedish championships have been awarded. Malmö FF is the most successful club with 20 Swedish championships.\nThe 19 title-winning clubs have come from a total of 13 cities. The most successful city is Gothenburg.\nThe Swedish championship has been won by 19 clubs from nine counties. The most successful county is Västra Götaland.\n\n"}

The opposite practice is hyperdescent, in which children are assigned to the race that is considered dominant or superior.\n\nParallel practices include patrilineality, matrilineality and cognatic descent, which assign race, ethnicity, or religion according to the father, mother, or some combination, without regard to the race of the other parent. \n\nAttempts to limit (or eliminate) mixed-race populations by legal means are defined in anti-miscegenation laws, such as passed by various states in the United States.\n\nWhile customs, practices and systems of belief emphasizing the value of purity of descent are arguably as old as mankind, few societies systematically codified them, or legally enforced their outcome. Practices were enforced in communities. Such was the case in classical Greece – which made clear distinctions between Greeks and Barbarians. The Roman Republic had a different pattern. While it was expansionist, and militarily and culturally aggressive, it actively encouraged the Romanisation of client kingdoms, which included intermarriage of Romans with their elite citizens and making this class citizens of Rome as reward and as exemplars.\n\nThe North American practice of applying a rule of hypodescent began during colonial times when indentured servants and transported convicts working at the direction of the colonists and colonial authorities were joined by Africans that from 1619 on were first taken first from Spanish and then more and more from English or British slave ships. But while the freed captives were Christians, these individuals were classified as indentured workers.\n\nVirginia formally enacted a 'slave code' in 1705. There is documentary evidence from the 1650s that some Virginia Negroes were serving lifelong terms of indenture. In the 1660s the Assembly stated that \"any English servant that shall run away in company with any Negroes who are incapable of making satisfaction by addition of time shall serve for the time of the said Negroes absence\", indicating Negroes could not 'make satisfaction' by serving longer if recaptured. This device gave legal status to the practice of lifetime enslavement of persons of African descent; in subsequent statutes the legislature defined conditions of lifetime servitude.\n\nBut in 1655 Elizabeth Key Grinstead, a mixed-race woman, fought and won the first freedom suit in Virginia. Her English father had acknowledged her as his daughter, had her baptised as Christian, and, falling ill, established a legal guardian to care for her after his death, arranging a limited-term indenture for her as a girl. But the guardian sold her indenture and left the colony, and the next master did not free her. When he died, his estate claimed her and her son as slave property.\n\nHowever, following Key's victory, Virginia established the principle in law in 1662 of \"partus sequitur ventrem\", from Roman law; that is, children born in the colonies would take the social status of their mothers. This meant that all children born to enslaved women would be born into slavery, regardless of their paternity and race. This was in contrast to English common law, by which the status of children of English subjects was determined by the father.\n\nAs slavery became a racial caste system, persons of only partial African ancestry and majority European ancestry were born into slavery. African descent became associated with slavery. By hypodescent, persons of even partial African ancestry were classified socially below whites. By the late 18th century, there were numerous families of majority-white slaves, such as the mixed-race children born to the slave Sally Hemings and her master Thomas Jefferson. She was three-quarters white and the half-sister of his late wife; their children, born into slavery, were seven-eighths white. Jefferson gave the four surviving children their freedom as adults; three assimilated into white society.\n\nThe Southern author Mary Chesnut wrote in her famous \"A Diary from Dixie\", of the Civil War-era, about the hypocrisy of a man's recognizing white women's children among the slaves in every household but his own.\n\nFanny Kemble, the British actress who married an American slaveholder, wrote about her observations of slavery as well, including the way white men sexually abused slave women and left their mixed-race children enslaved.\n\nSometimes the white fathers freed the children and/or their mothers, or provided education or apprenticeship, or settled property on them in a significant transfer of social capital. Notable antebellum examples of fathers who provided for their mixed-race children were the fathers of Charles Henry Langston and John Mercer Langston and the father of the Healy family of Georgia. (Each had a common-law marriage with a woman of partial African descent.) Other mixed-race children were left enslaved; some were sold away by their fathers.\n\nResearch by historians and genealogists has shown that unlike the above examples, most free African Americans listed in the first two US censuses in the Upper South were descended from relationships or marriages in colonial Virginia between white women, indentured servant or free, and African or African-American men, indentured servant, free or slave. Their unions reflected the fluid nature of relationships among the working classes before slave caste was hardened, as well as the small households and farms within which many people worked. The children of white mothers were born free. If they were illegitimate and mixed race, they were apprenticed in order to avoid the community being burdened with upkeep, but such persons gained a step in freedom.\n\nBy the turn of the nineteenth century, many of these families of free African Americans, along with European-American neighbors, migrated to frontier areas of Virginia, North Carolina, and then further west. Such families sometimes settled in insular groups. Mixed-race people of African-European descent are believed to have been the origin of some isolated settlements, which have long claimed or were said to be of American Indian or Portuguese ancestry. As an example, a 21st-century DNA study of a group of Melungeon families in Tennessee and Kentucky, long rumored to be descendants of Turks or Native Americans, showed they were overwhelmingly of African and European ancestry.\n\nBy the late 1870s, conservative white Democrats regained power in state legislatures across the South, even in areas where there were black majorities, largely by a process of violence and intimidation of black Republicans. The Democrats gradually imposed white supremacy in law and practice. From 1890 to 1908, beginning with Mississippi, the state legislatures passed new constitutions and laws that created barriers to voter registration by such means as the poll tax, literacy tests, record requirements and others. The number of voters on the rolls fell drastically and most blacks and many poor whites were disenfranchised for decades. The whites also passed Jim Crow laws, such as racial segregation of public facilities.\n\nAfrican Americans and whites established the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1909 to fight against legal discrimination and disenfranchisement. Each time they won a court case, for instance, against the use of white primaries, white-dominated legislatures would pass new laws to exclude blacks from the political system.\n\nIn the 20th century, under influences of eugenics and racial discrimination, states enacted laws classifying persons as black who had any traceable evidence (or perception of any African ancestry). Under Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924, the 'One-drop' rule defined as black a person with \"any\" known African ancestry, regardless of the number of intervening generations.\n\nThe same Act established a binary classification system for vital records, classifying persons as 'white' or 'black' (Negro at the time). The latter was effectively a 'catch all' term for all people of color. Native Americans were classified as colored, l attitude to \"all\" races other than white.\n\nIn its most extreme form in the United States, hypodescent was the basis of the \"one drop rule\", meaning that if an individual had any black ancestry, the person was classified as black. Laws were passed in southern states and others in the early 20th century, long after the end of slavery to define white and black, under associated laws for segregation: Tennessee adopted such a \"one-drop\" statute in 1910; Louisiana; Texas; Arkansas in 1911; Mississippi in 1917; North Carolina in 1923; Virginia in 1924; Alabama and Georgia in 1927; and Oklahoma in 1931.\n\nDuring this same period, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Utah retained their old \"blood fraction\" statutes \"de jure\", but amended these fractions (one-sixteenth, one-thirtysecond) to be equivalent to one-drop \"de facto.\"\n\nBy 1924 many \"white\" people in Virginia would have had some African and/or Native American ancestry, given the mixing over the centuries. At the same time that Virginia was trying to harden racial caste, African Americans were organizing to overturn segregation and regain civil rights, that had been lost to Jim Crow laws and disfranchisement of the majority of the black community.\n\nBy the early 1940s, of the thirty U.S. states that had anti-miscegenation laws, seven states (Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Montana, Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia) had adopted the one-drop theory for rules prohibiting interracial marriages. This was part of a continuing social hardening of racial lines after the turn of the century, when southern states imposed legal segregation and disfranchised African Americans.\n\nOther states applied the hypodescent rule without carrying it to the \"one-drop\" extreme, using instead a blood quantum standard. For example, Utah's anti-miscegenation law prohibited marriage between a white and anyone considered a negro, mulatto, quadroon (one-fourth black), octoroon (one-eighth black), Mongolian, or member of \"the Malay race\" (here referring to Filipinos). No restrictions were placed on marriages between people who were not \"white persons\". The law was repealed in 1963.\n\nIn the United States, hypodescent has often defined children of mixed-race couples as black when one parents is classified as \"black\", or either is thought to have African descent. That practice seems to be diminishing.\n\nPresident of the United States Barack Obama is often referred to as the first Black or African-American President. He has said as a youth that he chose to identify as black and worked in community organizing in a black community. His mother and her parents were of European descent; his father and his family are sub-Saharan African from Kenya. But, in a case exemplifying the complex racial history of the United States, Obama is believed to be descended through his maternal line from John Punch, the first African documented historically as a slave in Virginia.\n\nThe genealogical company Ancestry.com sponsored a study of his family history and documented this connection. Punch's descendants increasingly married white and are believed to have been accepted as white by the early 18th century.\n\nSince the 1960s particularly and the rise of the Black Power movement, many members of the African-American community have emphasized that mixed-race individuals of African descent should identify as black in order to maximize their political power as a group in the United States. Leaders say they were historically discriminated against as black by whites, so should identify as black to assert their power in number.\n\nIn the US, people have historically less consistently apply hypodescent in intermarriage between whites and persons of other racial groups, such as Native Americans, and Asians. There was certainly discrimination against persons of mixed European and Native American, and European and Asian ancestry, however.\n\nBut hypodescent is not practiced only by persons of European ancestry. In Omaha, Nebraska, whites have celebrated Logan Fontenelle, a mixed-race man of the late 19th century who served as interpreter for a major treaty between the Omaha Nation and the United States that ceded most of their land before they moved to a reservation. Whites referred to Fontenell as chief of the Omaha, and he was one of the signatories of the treaty along with Omaha chiefs, perhaps because he spoke English. Whites named various places in the city of Omaha after Fontenelle.\n\nBut among the Omaha, Fontenelle was considered a \"white man\" because his father was white, and he was never recognized as a recognized chief. As the Omaha had a patrilineal kinship society, hereditary chieftainship and descent were passed through the male line. A person whose father was white was not considered Omaha unless he was formally adopted by a male Omaha member.\n\nEvolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, in \"\" (2004), observes in passing that in the United States and Great Britain, societies have developed something like \"genetic dominance\" in our use of language to identify children from mixed-race unions. He notes first, that people seem to be eager to embrace racial classification, even when talking about people of obviously mixed parentage; and second, that we tend not to describe people as of mixed race. Mixed-race children of European-African unions tend to be identified as \"black\", in what Dawkins calls a \"cultural or memetic dominant\". He opines that this may be a cross-cultural practice with a biological basis; that perhaps humans are genetically wired to recognize and differentiate among minor superficial differences. This is in contrast to what humans share in the \"unusually high level of genetic uniformity in the human species\" (compared to for example, chimpanzee subspecies). Scholars speculate about the evolutionary purpose of such differentiation served; it may have contributed to group solidarity when social groups were small tribes of hunter gatherers, lived further apart in different regions, and were divided by many cultural factors. He suggests that such differentiation may be an \"information-rich way to classify people\".\n\nBoth African-American and white authors have explored issues related to mixed race and hypodescent in fiction and non-fiction.\n\nIn the novel \"Pudd'nhead Wilson\", by Mark Twain, the character of the enslaved woman Roxy is described as \"Negro\", although she has considerable white ancestry and could pass for white. Her son is born into slavery and is 1/32 part black. He is mistakenly switched in infancy with the white son of the master's household, and each grows up to fulfill his social role.\n\nThe US late-19th century author Charles Chesnutt, who grew up free in Ohio and was of mixed African-European ancestry, wrote numerous stories set in the post-Civil War South. He explored the issues encountered by persons of mixed race, in some cases relating what became known as the tragic mulatto genre.\n\n\"Passing\" is a 1929 novel by Nella Larsen, dealing with mixed-race African-American women who choose alternate paths for marriage and identity.\n\nIn the musical \"Show Boat\" (1927), a white man is married to a mixed-race woman passing for white. He is accused by the sheriff of violating the state's anti-miscegenation laws. The white man pricks his wife's finger with a knife, swallows a drop of blood, then tells the sheriff \"I'm no white man – I've got negro blood in me.\" The sheriff lets him off.\n\nSinclair Lewis's novel \"Kingsblood Royal\" uses hypodescent and the \"one drop\" principle as principal plot elements.\n\nNumerous memoirs have been published by African Americans who explore growing up as mixed race with a white parent, such as \"\" by James McBride. Bliss Broyard, in \"\", wrote about her father Anatole Broyard's decision to live and work as a writer, rather than a black writer, largely separating from his mixed-race, Louisiana Creole family. He married a white woman of Swedish descent and their children appear white.\n\nIn his self-published book \"Hypodescent - Discovering You Are Not Black: A Memoir\" (2010), Logan Allerton, adopted as an infant, describes being classified at birth as African American because of his darker skin. He was adopted and raised by an African-American family in Chicago, where he was often questioned as a child about his ethnic identity. Later in life, based on research and DNA testing, he learned that his biological ancestry was European.\n\n\n"}

He worked briefly in both Europe and South Africa before emigrating to Palestine in 1905 and establishing a school of Jewish music there in 1919. In 1922 he moved to Cincinnati, Ohio to take a position as professor of Jewish music at Hebrew Union College. He died in Johannesburg, South Africa, where he also supported the establishment of South African Progressive Judaism.\n\nIdelsohn is generally acknowledged as the “father” of modern Jewish musicology. During his time in Jerusalem, he noted a great diversity of musical traditions among the Jews living in the region. Idelsohn examined these traditional melodies and found recurring motifs and progressions that were not found in any other national music. This suggested a common origin for musical phrases that went back to Israel/Palestine in the first century C.E. He found that these motifs fell into three distinct tonal centers, which corresponded to the Dorian, Phrygian, and Lydian modes of the ancient Greeks. Each of these modes elicited a distinct psycho-emotional response. The Dorian Mode was used for texts of an elevated and inspired nature; the Phrygian for sentimental texts, with their very human outbreaks of feeling, both of joy and grief; and the Lydian was used in composing music for the texts of lamenting and confessions of sins. Idelsohn further categorized and defined these motives as ones that either prepared a musical phrase, began it, or concluded it.\n\nHis works include the monumental \"Thesaurus of Hebrew Oriental Melodies\" (10 volumes, 1914–1932) and \"Jewish Music\" (1929). He is considered to be the author of the lyrics of the famous Jewish folk song \"Hava Nagila.\"\n\nHe is the maternal grandfather of Joel Goodman Joffe (Baron Joffe).\n\n"}

Later, rival kings produced differing definitions. Domnall's legal men, for example, claimed that a High King \"with opposition\" was the king of a province who could lead his army throughout Ireland without defeat, and this Domnall could do. The supporters of his southern rival, Muirchertach Ua Briain of Munster, disagreed, and said a High King \"without opposition\" should control three great port cities of Ireland: Dublin, Waterford, and Limerick, cities over which Muirchertach exercised some control.\n\nRegardless of legal frictions, he was the first king to construct something resembling an over-lordship of Ireland after the death of Máel Sechnaill was Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó of the Uí Cheinnselaig. King of Leinster and the Foreigners in his obituary, Diarmait was more than this, the effective ruler of much of Ireland. His son Murchad ruled Dublin, Toirdelbach Ua Briain in Munster was his client, and Niall mac Eochada of Ulster was his ally. Diarmait's career ended with his death in battle, attempting to subjugate the heirs of Máel Sechnaill, on Tuesday 7 February 1072.\n\nDiarmait's position was quickly taken by his former ally Toirdelbach Ua Briain. Ua Briain installed his son, Muirchertach in Dublin, and campaigned in Ulster. In Leinster and Connacht he pursued a policy of setting rival families against each other. Domnall Ua Lochlainn, on his coming to power in 1084, was left undisturbed by Ua Briain, who fell ill the following year and died in 1086, aged 77. At his death, even the partisan northern annals recognized Toirdelbach Ua Briain as king of Ireland.\n\nDomnall was the son of a certain Ardgar son of Lochlann. Genealogical compilations, such as that surviving in the Rawlinson B.502 manuscript trace Domnall's ancestry back, through the High King Domnall ua Néill, and his father the heroic Muirchertach of the Leather Cloaks, to Niall Glúndub. It appears subtly different in the \"Book of Leinster\". Rather than being the descendants of Lochlann, grandson of Domnall ua Néill, the Meic Lochlainn appear to have been descended from another Lochlann, Lochlann mac Maíl Sechnaíll, a descendant of Niall Glúndub's less renowned brother Domnall Dabaill. Nonetheless, the Meic Lochlainn were members of the Cenél nEógain branch of the Uí Néill, and could rightly claim famous ancestors. Under Domnall, the Cenél nEógain were again a significant force in Irish politics.\n\nIn the years before Domnall, the Cenél nEógain had been largely bereft of effective leadership, so much so that Conchobar Ua Briain of Munster, cousin and bitter enemy of Toirdelbach, had been invited to take the kingship of the Tulach Óc branch of the kindred, and following Conchobar's murder with his wife in 1078, his brother Cennétig was invited to succeed him.\n\nDomnall became king of Ailech in 1083 and began his reign in traditional fashion, with an inaugural raid—\"crech ríg\"—against the Conaille Muirthemne (in the region of modern Dundalk, County Louth). The \"Annals of Ulster\" state that Domnall \"carried off a great prey of cattle and gave stipends from that prey to the men of Fernmag [the people and land from whom modern County Fermanagh was named]\".\n\nHowever, Muirchertach Ua Briain the new king of Munster (a matrilineal kinsman of Toirdelbach), moved to oppose the rule of Meic Lochlainn between 1101 and 1119.\n\nDomnall's glowing obituary in the \"Annals of Ulster\" reads as follows:Domnall son of Ardgar son of Lochlann, over-king of Ireland, pre-eminent among the Irish in form and lineage, in sense and valour, in happiness and prosperity, in giving valuables and food, died in Daire Coluim Cille in the thirty-eighth year of his reign, the seventy-third year of his age, on Wednesday night, the fourth of the Ides [i.e. 10 February 1121] and the eighteenth of the moon, the feast of Mo-Chuaróc the wise.\n\n"}

{"id": "2156650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156650", "title": "Regnal year", "text": "Regnal year\n\nA regnal year is a year of the reign of a sovereign, from the Latin \"regnum\" meaning kingdom, rule. Regnal years considered the date as an ordinal, not a cardinal number. For example, a monarch could have a first year of rule, a second year of rule, a third year of rule, and so on, but not a zeroth year of rule. \n\nApplying this ancient epoch system to modern calculations of time, which include zero, is what led to the debate over when the third millennium began. Regnal years are \"finite era names\", contrary to \"infinite era names\" such as Christian era, Jimmu era, Juche era, and so on.\n\nIn ancient times, calendars were counted in terms of the number of years of the reign of the current monarch. Reckoning long periods of times required a king list. The oldest such reckoning is preserved in the Sumerian king list. Ancient Egyptian chronology was also dated using regnal years. The Zoroastrian calendar also operated with regnal years following the reform of Ardashir I in 3rd century.\n\nThe Canon of Kings is a list that dates the reigns of various Babylonian, Persian, Macedonian, Egyptian, and Roman monarchs, that was used by ancient astronomers as a way to date astronomical phenomena. The Liberian Catalogue is a similar list of popes of Early Christianity, that was used to date early events in the religion's history.\n\nRegnal years were generally used for year marking in East Asia before the advent of era names. In China, the first continuous use of era names was in 140 BC, during the rule of the Emperor Wu of Han. Prior to that, years were usually marked as regnal years of the monarch.\n\nSince 140 BC, era names served as titles for the purpose of numbering and identifying years. Era names were used for over two millennia by Chinese emperors and are still used in Japan.\n\nThe Lanfang Republic era, Republic of Formosa era and Republic of China calendar are systems adapted from the traditional era name system, but they are not effectively era names. The and Juche era are based on the year of birth of the thinker or eternal president. The , and kōki were counted in terms of the number of years of the reign of the first monarch.\n\nAs a result of Chinese cultural influence, other polities in the Sinosphere—Korea, Vietnam and Japan—also adopted the concept of era name as a result of Chinese cultural influence.\n\nAbolished era names may be reused, for example as a means of claiming or denying political legitimacy. An example of this is, that when the Yongle emperor usurped the throne from his nephew he dated the year of his accession as \"洪武三十五年\", the 35th year of his father, the Hongwu Emperor's reign, i.e. 1402. Hongwu had in fact died in 1398, and the short reign of the Jianwen Emperor, who ruled between 1398 and 1402 was written out of the official record. However, they would sometimes still be used. 景初四年 (240) was used on Japanese bronze mirrors. 廣德四年 (766) and 建中八年 (787) were used in a Western Regions tomb and a document. Kuchlug did not change the era name.\n\nAfter the Ming Dynasty fell, the Joseon Dynasty still used Chongzhen, and the Kingdom of Tungning still used Yongli regnal years, thus denying the legitimacy of the Qing dynasty, and showing continued allegiance to the Ming regime. \n\nThe short lived , post Zhang Xianzhong, used the Ganzhi calendar without era names. Overseas Chinese used Longfei (龍飛) or Tianyun (天運).\n\nChinese era names (年號, niánhào) were used since 140 BC. Until 1367 AD several were used during each emperor's reign. From 1368 AD until 1912 AD only one era name was used by each emperor, who was posthumously known by his era name, which meant that the era name became equivalent to a regnal year. The tradition of Chinese era names survives in the Republic of China's Minguo calendar, with \"Minguo\", the Chinese for Republic, taking the place of the era name.\n\nThe official Japanese system or numbers years from the accession of the current emperor, regarding the calendar year during which the accession occurred as the first year. The system was in use sporadically from 645 and continuously from 701. Until 1867 several era names were used during each emperor's reign. From 1868 only one has been used by each emperor. Since 1868 each emperor has been known posthumously by his era name.\n\nThe current emperor, Naruhito succeeded to the throne on 1 May 2019, after his father Akihito abdicated the throne, citing age and poor health. The name of his era is Reiwa, which was formally announced by the Government of Japan a month before Naruhito succeeded the throne, on 1 April 2019. Therefore, 1 May 2019 is considered the beginning of the Reiwa 1.\n\nThe former emperor, Akihito, succeeded the throne on 7 January 1989 on the death of his father Emperor Shōwa, with the name Heisei decreed as the name of his regnal era by the Cabinet. Thus the year 1989 corresponds to .\n\nThe use of era names was common throughout the various historical states that occupied the Korean peninsula. Korean endemic eras were used from 391 to 1274 and from 1894 to 1910. During the later years of the Joseon Dynasty, years were also numbered from the founding of that dynasty in 1393. From 1952 until 1961, years were numbered in Dangi in South Korea, counting from the legendary founding of Gojoseon in 2333 BC.\n\nDuring the Joseon Dynasty, Korea used Chinese era names as a demonstration of its respect and loyalty to Ming and Qing dynasty of China. Even after the Ming Dynasty was replaced by Qing, Koreans continued to use the Ming era names, using the era name of the last Ming emperor, the Chongzhen Emperor, after his death in 1644, and continued to do so for nearly 200 years. However, this was done mostly privately, because of the pressure exerted by the Qing government.\n\nThe tradition of Korean era names survives in the North Korean Juche calendar, with Juche year 1 being 1912 the year of the birth of Kim Il-sung.\n\nRegnal years continues to see limited use in the Commonwealth realms, a group of sixteen sovereign states that share the same monarch. The present conventions for regnal years in the Commonwealth realms originates with the Kingdom of England, which used regnal years to date its public documents. The start of a new regnal era in the English regnal dating system originally began on the date of the monarch's coronation. However, the system was changed in 1307 to begin on the date the monarch succeeds the throne, beginning with the ascension of Edward II. \n\nThe regnal years used throughout the Commonwealth realms are identical to one another, as they share the same line of succession. The present monarch, Elizabeth II, became the sovereign on 6 February 1952, after the death of her father George VI. Thus, 6 February 1952 is considered the beginning of the year 1 Eliz. 2; with the last day of each Eliz. 2 regnal year being 5 February. \n\nThe regnal dating system is used in the numbering system for all Acts of the Parliament of Canada. All Acts are given an individual chapter number, assigned by its numeric order of when it received royal assent, along with the regnal year, and the name of the reigning Monarch of Canada. The use of regnal years in legal citations is acceptable in Canadian legal practices, although usage of the Gregorian calendar is more common.\n\nThe use of the regnal year was used throughout the legislative sessional volumes of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, until it was replaced by the calendar year in 1949. However, the regnal year continues to be used on the title pages of the legislature's sessional volumes.\n\nThe use of regnal years in the United Kingdom originated in England, a country of the United Kingdom. The regnal dating system was used to date documents of parliamentary sessions until 1963, when it began to date its documents using the Gregorian calendar. The change to the Gregorian calendar was legislated under the \"Acts of Parliament Numbering and Citation Act 1962\".\n\nWhile not strictly a regnal year, time in the United States of America can be derived from the Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776). For example, the U.S. Constitution is dated as signed in \"the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and Eighty seven and of the Independence of the United States of America the Twelfth,\" and Presidential proclamations will often be ended \"IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this [ordinal] day of [month], in the year of our Lord [year], and of the Independence of the United States of America the [year].\" 2020 is the year of the Independence of the United States of America on and after July 4 of that year. Time is also sometimes reckoned in terms (and sessions, if necessary) of Congress; e.g. House of Representatives Bill 2 of the 112th Congress is dated \"112th CONGRESS, 1st Session\".\n"}

He was gone for five years. In 1856-57 he visited the Cape of Good Hope, travelling as far east as Algoa Bay, and subsequently wrote a treatise on South African fish (1861). \n\nHe served as the French consul in Bahia in 1848; in Siam from 1848 until 1862, and in Melbourne, Australia from 1864 to 1877.\n\nThrough no fault of his own, Castelnau's name is attached to an Australian hoax. \"\"Ompax spatuloides\" \", a supposed ganoid fish said to have been discovered in 1872 and named by Castelnau, was a joke originally directed at Karl Staiger, the director of the Brisbane Museum. Staiger forwarded a sketch and description of the made-up fish to Castelnau, who duly described it.\n\nCastelnau is commemorated, among others, in the scientific name of a species of Australian gecko, \"Oedura castelnaui\", of a species of ground beetle, \"Megacephala castelnaui\", a species of scarab beetle, \"Hybosorus laportei\", an aphid \"Cinara laportei\", and of the spotback skate, \"Atlantoraja castelnaui\".\n\n\n"}

Instead, the enamel still has the same arrangement of enamel rods.

It is one of the works which he published under his own name, as opposed to his more famous \"pseudonymous\" works. \"Works of Love\" deals primarily with the Christian conception of ' love in contrast with erotic love (') or preferential love (\"\") given to friends and family. Kierkegaard uses this value/virtue to understand the existence and relationship of the individual Christian. Having helped found Existentialism, he uses it and a high-level of theology citing the scriptures of the Christian Bible. Many of the chapters take a mention of love from the New Testament and center reflections about the transfer of individuals from secular modes (the stages of the aesthetic and ethical) to genuine religious experience and existence. Since human experience is a key to understanding Kierkegaard, the actual relationships and experiences of disciples and of Christ are characterized here as tangible models for behavior.\n\nKierkegaard as a Christian ethicist (represented by this work) is likely to be considered distinct from many ways in which the religion's mainstream seems to function from the viewpoint of an outside observer. This is not only a function of Christian existentialism but also of his time period and political events occurring in his native Denmark.\n\n\nThe \"Works\" as Kierkegaard himself states are Christian reflections and not discourses.

Published in 2001, it is a pastiche of the science fiction story \"Flowers for Algernon\". \"Flowers for Rhino\" appeared in \"Spider-Man's Tangled Web\" #5–6.\n\nRhino, a brutish and dimwitted enemy of Spider-Man, suffers a mid-life crisis after he attempts to rescue Stella, the beautiful daughter of a mob boss, who coldly informs him after he is hired as a full-time bodyguard on the grounds that he is too stupid to be a serious romantic or business threat. Recalling a recent meeting with the doctors who created his latest suit, he undergoes a brain operation that turns him into a super genius.\n\nWith his new intellect, he quickly demonstrates a change in his usual methods, allowing him to defeat Spider-Man, subsequently running away with Stella to start his own crime organization. With his new intellect, he writes a novel, gets a restraining order that prevents Spider-Man from attacking him, sets up a crime syndicate (with the aid of such other criminals as the Mad Thinker, after breaking them out of prison), and even rewrites \"Hamlet\". Unfortunately, it has the side effect of making the subject so intelligent that he is no longer able to fully enjoy life, with Rhino driving Stella away because he finds her too dimwitted to attract his attention. Finally reaching a point where he finds no real meaning in life, Rhino hands Spider-Man, having deduced his identity via an equation he developed that allows him to calculate the secret identities of superheroes, information with which he can bring down Rhino's crime empire.

More than half of the land used to be part of the Peel, an area of vital importance for the local farmers. The presence of wide areas of moorland led to the development of sheep farming and related cottage industries, such as the production of yarn, cloth and hats. Sheep produced an average of 2,5 kilograms of wool each per annum, and were therefore a welcome source of secondary income, quite apart from the droppings that they left on the land. At that time sheep were not reared for their meat.\n\nHowever, the French soldiers who were stationed in Venray from 1794 to 1814 were enthusiastic mutton eaters, and this gave the farmers cause to take another look at the economic value of their animals.\n\nAround 1809 some of the sheep farmers had the idea of driving their sheep to Paris, at that time the capital city of the empire to which they belonged, and offering them for sale. When it became known that this trade was profitable, others soon followed in the pioneers' footsteps. Five farmers pooled their interests and founded a partnership, \"De Grote Compagnie\" (The big company), which set up an organized trade route between Venray and Paris, with fixed staging posts along the way.\n\nThe drive on foot to the markets of Paris took two weeks on average, and ran south of the Peel to Antwerp, and then through the lush pastures along the Schelde to northern France. The herds were collected together in the border village of Warcoing before undertaking the last stage of their journey to Paris.\n\nInitially the partners only drove their own sheep, but within a few years there was a network of buyers in The Netherlands, and Venray became the focus of a trade which saw tens of thousands of sheep being sent to France each year, not only by \"De Grote Compagnie\", but also by five smaller enterprises.\n\nUnder the Raets, Poels, Camps, Trynes and Vorstermans families the business flourished to such a degree that in 1845 a second outlet market, London, was opened up, to which the sheep were transported from ports such as Harlingen, Medemblik, Rotterdam, and Vlissingen.\n\nDutch sheep farmers were meanwhile unable to cope with the demand, so that ever increasing numbers of German sheep were being bought, and when even this source proved inadequate, representatives of the company travelled to the Ukraine, Denmark and Iceland in circa 1875, and in 1891 a trading office was opened in Buenos Aires, which arranged for the transport of not just live sheep, but also deep-frozen meat to Europe. At the beginning of the 20th century, the meat trade in the slaughterhouses of Paris, London and Antwerp was dominated by Venray businesses, and until the outbreak of World War II they were the most important producers of bacon and tinned ham in Poland, Hungary, and Canada.\n\nAlthough the smaller sheep companies folded one by one after 1900, \"De Grote Compagnie\" remained in existence until 1951, when representatives of the eleven participating families from a number of different countries held their final annual gathering in the high-class Swan Hotel in Venray, at the card table of which, 150 years earlier, their joint company had been founded. In the intervening time this initiative had given rise to a host of independent companies. At this gathering the final collective bank balance, a sum of 5,000 guilders, was presented to the parochial church of Venray to finance a new choir stall, which since then serves as a reminder of a unique example of Limburg enterprise.\n\n"}

WMA was formally established on September 18, 1947 and has grown in 2018 to 113 national medical associations and more than 10 million physicians.\n\nThe WMA provides a forum for its member associations to communicate freely, to co-operate actively, to achieve consensus on high standards of medical ethics and professional competence and to promote the professional freedom of physicians worldwide. With this unique partnership, WMA aims to facilitate high-caliber, humane care to patients in a healthy environment, enhancing the quality of life for all people in the world.\n\nThe purpose of the WMA is to serve humanity by endeavoring to achieve the highest international standards in Medical Education, Medical Science, Medical Art and Medical Ethics, and Health Care for all people in the world.\n\nThe WMA was founded on 18 September 1947, when physicians from 27 different countries met at the First General Assembly of the WMA in Paris. This organization was built from an idea born in the House of the British Medical Association in 1945, within a meeting organized in London to initiate plans for an international medical organization to replace l'Association Professionnelle Internationale des Médecins\", which had suspended its activities because of World War II.\n\nIn order to facilitate financial support from its member associations, in 1948, the executive board, known as the Council, established the Secretariat of the WMA in New York City in order to provide close liaison with the United Nations and its various agencies. The WMA Secretariat remained in New York City until 1974 when for reasons of economy, and in order to operate within the vicinity of Geneva-based international organizations (WHO, ILO, ICN, ISSA, etc.) it was transferred to its present location in Ferney-Voltaire, France.\nThe WMA members gathered in an annual meeting, which from 1962 was named \"World Medical Assembly.\"\n\nSince its beginning WMA has shown concern over the state of medical ethics in general and over the world, taking the responsibility for setting ethical guidelines for the world physicians. A modernized wording of the ancient oath of Hippocrates was sent for consideration at the II General Assembly in Geneva in 1948. The medical vow was adopted and the Assembly agreed to name it the \"Declaration of Geneva.\"\n\nAlso in the same II General Assembly a report on \"War Crimes and Medicine\" was received. This prompted the Council to appoint another Study Committee to prepare an International Code of Medical Ethics, which after an extensive discussion, was adopted in 1949 by the III General Assembly.\n\nEven after the adoption of these two documents, WMA was constantly being informed about violations of medical ethics, crimes committed by doctors in time of war, unethical human experimentation, among several other problems in the field of medical ethics and medical law. This information caused the Council to establish a permanent Committee on Medical Ethics in 1952, which has been working actively ever since, as one can see from the declarations or statements of the WMA and their continuous updates.\n\nDuring the World Medical Association General Assembly in Reykjavik in early October 2018, members of the Canadian Medical Association stated that parts of the speech by WMA's incoming president Leonid Eidelman had been plagiarized from a speech made in 2014 by Chris Simpson (cardiologist) who was then the president of CMA. Current president Dr. Gigi Osler told the group that part of the address was \"copied word for word\" from Simpson's speech. \"Multiple other parts of the speech were also copied from various websites, blogs and news articles, without proper appropriate attribution to the authors\", she latter added in a statement. A motion by Canada at the Assembly to call on Eidelman to resign was not successful. On 6 October, the CMA resigned; their press release stated that the decision was made because WMA was not upholding ethical standards.\n\nIn an email to The Canadian Press, WMA spokesman Nigel Duncan said that Eidelman's speech had been written by others and that he did not know that it might contain plagiarism. A WMA source also told The Canadian Press that Eidelman apologized at the general assembly, after the Canadian delegates had departed; he \"acknowledge[d] that part of his speech was taken from Simpson\", and most delegates \"accepted his apology\" for the mistake.\n\nThe main decision-making body of the WMA is the General Assembly, which meets annually and is formed by delegations from the National Member Associations, officers and members of the Council of the WMA, and representatives of the Associate Members (Associate Members are individual physicians who wish to join the WMA).\n\nThe Assembly elects the WMA Council every two years with representatives drawn from each of the six WMA regions, namely Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America and the Pacific. It also elects the WMA president annually, who is the Ceremonial Head of the WMA. The President, President Elect and Immediate Past President form the Presidium that is available to speak for the WMA and represent it officially.\n\nEvery two years, the WMA Council, excluding the Presidium, elects a Chairperson who is the political head of the organization.\nAs Chief Executive of the operational units of the WMA, the Secretary-General is in full-time employment at the Secretariat, appointed by the WMA Council.\n\nThe WMA Secretariat is situated in Ferney-Voltaire, France, adjacent to the City of Geneva.\n\nEnglish, French, and Spanish are the official languages of the association since its creation.\n\nThe WMA have the following status of membership:\n\nSee more information on Membership by clicking on the following link (WMA Membership):\n\nThe WMA is active in several areas of action, but mainly in:\n\nIn what concerns Ethics, the WMA has various Declarations, Resolutions and Statements with which tries to help to guide National Medical Associations, governments and international organizations throughout the world.

Comey had been a registered Republican for most of his adult life; in 2016, he described himself as unaffiliated.\n\nComey was the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York from January 2002 to December 2003, and the United States deputy attorney general from December 2003 to August 2005 in the administration of President George W. Bush. In August 2005, Comey left the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and became a senior vice president of Lockheed Martin as general counsel while based in Bethesda, Maryland. In 2010, he became general counsel at Bridgewater Associates, based in Westport, Connecticut. In early 2013, he left Bridgewater to become a senior research scholar and Hertog fellow on national security law at Columbia Law School. He served on the board of directors of HSBC Holdings until July 2013.\n\nIn September 2013, President Barack Obama appointed Comey to the position of Director of the FBI. In that capacity, he was responsible for overseeing the FBI's investigation of the Hillary Clinton email controversy. His role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election was highly controversial. Many Clinton supporters claim his decisions not long before the 2016 election might have cost her the presidency, particularly his decision to reopen the investigation into Clinton's emails less than two weeks before the election. Comey also received heavy criticism from Republicans after it was revealed that he had begun drafting an exoneration letter for Clinton before the investigation was complete. On June 14, 2018, DOJ inspector general Michael E. Horowitz released his report on the FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, which criticized Comey's actions during the 2016 election.\n\nPresident Donald Trump fired Comey on May 9, 2017. Statements from Trump and the White House suggested that Comey had been fired to ease the \"pressure\" Trump was under due to the Russia investigation. Later that month, Comey arranged for a friend to leak to the press a memo he had written after a February 14, 2017 private meeting with the president. It said Trump had asked him to end the FBI's investigation into Michael Flynn, the former national security advisor. The dismissal, various memos detailing meetings with Trump, and Comey's subsequent Congressional testimony in June that same year were interpreted by some commentators as evidence of obstruction of justice by the president and became part of the Mueller investigation. Inspector General Horowitz found that Comey violated FBI policy regarding the memos, but the Department of Justice declined to prosecute Comey. \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\" reported on November 22, 2019 that a forthcoming Horowitz report did not find Comey engaged in politically biased actions against Trump.\n\nComey was born on December 14, 1960, in Yonkers, New York, to parents Joan Marie Comey (née Herald) and J. Brien Comey. His grandfather, William J. Comey, was an officer and later commissioner of the Yonkers Police Department. The family moved to Allendale, New Jersey, in the early 1970s. His father worked in corporate real estate and his mother was a computer consultant and homemaker. Comey is of Irish heritage. He attended Northern Highlands Regional High School in Allendale; in 1977 he and his brother were victims of a home invasion by a criminal called \"The Ramsey Rapist\". Comey graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1982, majoring in chemistry and religion. His senior thesis analyzed the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr and the televangelist Jerry Falwell, emphasizing their common belief in public action. He received his Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of Chicago Law School in 1985.\n\nAfter law school, Comey was a law clerk for United States district judge John M. Walker Jr. in Manhattan. Then, he was an associate for Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher in their New York office. He joined the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, where he worked from 1987 to 1993. While there, he was Deputy Chief of the Criminal Division and helped prosecute the Gambino crime family.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2001, Comey was Managing Assistant U.S. Attorney in charge of the Richmond Division of the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. In 1996, Comey acted as deputy special counsel to the Senate Whitewater Committee. He also was the lead prosecutor in the case concerning the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia. While in Richmond, Comey was an adjunct professor of law at the University of Richmond School of Law.\n\nComey was the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, from January 2002 to the time of his confirmation as Deputy Attorney General on December 11, 2003. Among his first tasks was to take over the investigation into President Bill Clinton's controversial pardon of Marc Rich, which Comey concluded involved no illegality. In November 2002, he led the prosecution of three men involved in one of the largest identity fraud cases in American history. The fraud had lasted two years and resulted in thousands of people across the country collectively losing over $3 million. He also led the indictment of Adelphia Communications founder John Rigas for bank fraud, wire fraud, and securities fraud. Rigas was convicted of the charges in 2004 and in 2005, was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison. Adelphia Corporation was forced to file for bankruptcy after it acknowledged that it took $3.3 billion in false loans. It was \"one of the most elaborate and extensive corporate frauds in United States history\".\n\nIn February 2003, Comey was the lead prosecutor of Martha Stewart, who was indicted on the charges of securities fraud, obstruction of justice, and lying to an FBI agent. She sold 3,928 shares of ImClone Systems, thereby avoiding a loss of $45,673. The next day, the Food and Drug Administration refused to accept the company's application for Erbitux. In March 2003, he led the indictment of ImClone CEO Samuel Waksal, who pleaded guilty for avoiding paying $1.2 million in sales taxes on $15 million worth of contemporary paintings. The works were by Mark Rothko, Richard Serra, Roy Lichtenstein, and Willem de Kooning. In April 2003, he led the indictment of Frank Quattrone, who allegedly urged subordinates in 2000 to destroy evidence sought by investigators looking into his investment banking practices at Credit Suisse First Boston. In November 2003, he led the prosecutions in \"Operation Wooden Nickel\", which resulted in complaints and indictments against 47 people involved in foreign exchange trading scams.\n\nComey appointed Patrick Fitzgerald to be the special counsel to head the grand jury investigation into the Plame affair after Attorney General John Ashcroft recused himself.\n\nIn early January 2006, \"The New York Times\", as part of its investigation into the Bush administration's warrantless domestic surveillance program, reported on an incident in which Comey and other Justice Department officials refused to certify the legality of central aspects of the National Security Administration (NSA) program. The DOJ had issued a finding that the domestic wiretapping under the Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP) was unconstitutional if such were done without a court warrant. Under White House procedures, Justice Department approval was required in order for the program to be renewed. In early March 2004, Federal Bureau of Investigation director Robert S. Mueller III and Comey had prepared their resignations if the White House overruled the DOJ's finding that the program was unconstitutional.\n\nOn March 10, 2004, while the issue was still pending, United States attorney general John Ashcroft was recovering in the intensive care unit at the George Washington University Hospital after gall bladder surgery. His wife was with him. He had recused himself from any Justice Department decisions while recovering, designating Comey as Acting Attorney General. In his hospital room he was visited by White House officials Alberto Gonzales and Andrew Card, who pressured him to sign papers reauthorizing the domestic surveillance program. Alarmed by the situation, his wife called for Comey to join them, and he summoned FBI director Mueller and two other DOJ officials, Jack Goldsmith and Patrick Philbin. None of the four would agree to reauthorize the program, and Ashcroft refused to take any action while he was recused. In Goldsmith's 2007 memoir, he said Comey had come to the hospital to support Ashcroft in withstanding pressure from the White House. Comey later confirmed these events took place in testimony to the United States Senate Judiciary Committee on May 16, 2007. FBI director Mueller's notes on the March 10, 2004, incident, which were released to a House Judiciary committee, confirms that he \"Saw (the) AG, John Ashcroft in the room (who was) feeble, barely articulate, clearly stressed.\"\n\nComey and Mueller cancelled their plans to resign after meeting on March 12, 2004, directly with President Bush, who directed that requisite changes be made to the surveillance program.\n\nWhen Comey was Deputy Attorney General in 2005, he endorsed a memorandum that approved the use of 13 so-called \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" that included waterboarding and sleep deprivation for up to , which would be used by the CIA when interrogating suspects. Comey objected to a second memorandum, drafted by Daniel Levin and signed by Steven G. Bradbury, which stated that these techniques could be used in combination. Comey was one of the few members of the Bush administration who had tried to prevent or limit the use of torture.\n\nDuring his 2013 confirmation hearing, Comey stated that in his personal opinion, waterboarding was torture, the United Nations Convention against Torture was \"very vague\" and difficult to interpret as banning the practice. Even though he believed the practice was legal at the time, he strongly disagreed with the techniques and as a matter of policy, he opposed implementing them. His objections were ultimately overruled by the National Security Council.\n\nComey left the Department of Justice in August 2005. In August 2005, it was announced that Comey would enter the private sector, becoming the general counsel and senior vice president for Lockheed Martin, the U.S. Department of Defense's largest contractor. Comey's tenure took effect on October 1, 2005, serving in that capacity until June 2, 2010, when he announced he would leave Lockheed Martin to join the senior management committee at Bridgewater Associates, a Connecticut-based investment management firm. Comey received a three million dollar payout from Bridgewater, his net worth estimated at 14 million dollars.\n\nOn February 1, 2013, after leaving Bridgewater, he was appointed by Columbia University Law School as a senior research scholar and Hertog fellow on national security law. He was also appointed to the board of directors of the London-based financial institution HSBC Holdings, to improve the company's compliance program after its $1.9 billion settlement with the Justice Department for failing to comply with basic due diligence requirements for money laundering regarding Mexican drug cartels and terrorism financing. Since 2012, he has also served on the Defense Legal Policy Board.\n\nIn May 2007, Comey testified before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and the House Judiciary subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law on the U.S. attorney dismissal controversy. His testimony contradicted that of former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who had said the firings had been due to poor performance on the part of some of the dismissed prosecutors. Comey stressed that the Justice Department had to be perceived as nonpartisan and nonpolitical to function.\n\n\"Politico\" reported in May 2009, White House officials pushed for Comey's inclusion on the short list of names to replace Associate Justice David Souter on the U.S. Supreme Court. \"Politico\" later reported liberal activists were upset about the possibility of Comey's name being included. John Brittain of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law stated, \"[Comey] came in with the Bushies. What makes you think he'd be just an inch or two more to the center than [John] Roberts? I'd be greatly disappointed.\"\n\nIn 2013, Comey was a signatory to an \"amicus curiae\" brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the \"Hollingsworth v. Perry\" case.\n\nThe May 2013 reports became official the following month when President Barack Obama revealed that he would nominate Comey to be the next director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, replacing outgoing director Robert Mueller. Comey was reportedly chosen over another finalist, Lisa Monaco, who had overseen national security issues at the Justice Department during the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012.\n\nOn July 29, 2013, the Senate confirmed Comey to a full ten-year term as FBI director. He was confirmed by a vote of 93–1. Two senators voted present. He was sworn in as FBI director on September 4, 2013. Comey was dismissed by President Donald Trump on May 9, 2017.\n\nIn February 2015, Comey delivered a speech at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., regarding the relationship between police and the African-American community. He said that, \"At many points in American history, law enforcement enforced the status quo – a status quo that was often brutally unfair to disfavored groups,\" mentioning as an example his own Irish ancestors, who he said had, in the early 20th century, often been regarded by law enforcement as drunks and criminals. He added, \"The Irish had some tough times, but little compares to the experience on our soil of black Americans,\" going on to highlight current societal issues such as lack of opportunities for employment and education which can lead young black men to crime. Comey stated:Police officers on patrol in our nation's cities often work in environments where a hugely disproportionate percentage of street crime is committed by young men of color. Something happens to people of good will working in that environment. After years of police work, officers often can't help be influenced by the cynicism they feel. A mental shortcut becomes almost irresistible.\n\nIn October 2015, Comey gave a speech in which he raised concerns that body worn video results in less effective policing; this opinion contradicted the President's public position. Days later, President Obama met with Comey in the Oval Office to address the issue.\n\nIn an October 23 speech at the University of Chicago Law School, Comey said:I remember being asked why we were doing so much prosecuting in black neighborhoods and locking up so many black men. After all, Richmond was surrounded by areas with largely white populations. Surely there were drug dealers in the suburbs. My answer was simple: We are there in those neighborhoods because that's where people are dying. These are the guys we lock up because they are the predators choking off the life of a community. We did this work because we believed that all lives matter, especially the most vulnerable.\n\nIn April 2015, Comey spoke at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, arguing in favor of more Holocaust education. After \"The Washington Post\" printed a version of his speech, Anne Applebaum wrote that his reference to \"the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary\" was inaccurately saying that Poles were as responsible for the Holocaust as Germans. His speech was also criticized by Polish authorities, and Stephen D. Mull, United States ambassador to Poland, was called to the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Applebaum wrote that Comey, \"in a speech that was reprinted in \"The Post\" arguing for more Holocaust education, demonstrated just how badly he needs it himself\".\n\nAmbassador Mull issued an apology for Comey's remarks. When asked about his remarks, Comey said, \"I regret linking Germany and Poland ... The Polish state bears no responsibility for the horrors imposed by the Nazis. I wish I had not used any other country names because my point was a universal one about human nature.\"\n\nIn June 2015, the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced that it had been the target of a data breach targeting the records of as many as four million people. Later, Comey put the number at 18 million. The \"Washington Post\" has reported that the attack originated in China, citing unnamed government officials. Comey said: \"It is a very big deal from a national security perspective and from a counterintelligence perspective. It's a treasure trove of information about everybody who has worked for, tried to work for, or works for the United States government.\"\n\nOn July 10, 2015, the FBI opened a criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was Secretary of State. On June 29, 2016, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton met aboard her plane on the tarmac of the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, leading to calls for her recusal. Lynch then announced that she would \"fully\" accept the recommendation of the FBI regarding the probe. On July 2, FBI agents completed their investigation by interviewing Hillary Clinton at FBI headquarters, following which Comey and his associates decided there was no basis for criminal indictments in the case.\n\nOn July 5, 2016, Comey announced the FBI's recommendation that the United States Department of Justice file no criminal charges relating to the Hillary Clinton email controversy. During a 15-minute press conference in the J. Edgar Hoover Building, Comey called Secretary Clinton's and her top aides' behavior \"extremely careless\", but concluded that \"no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case\". It was believed to be the first time the FBI disclosed its prosecutorial recommendation to the Department of Justice publicly. On July 7, 2016, Comey was questioned by a Republican-led House committee during a hearing regarding the FBI's recommendation.\n\nOn October 26, 2016, two weeks before the presidential election, Comey learned that FBI agents investigating an unrelated case involving former congressman Anthony Weiner had discovered emails on Weiner's computer between his wife, Huma Abedin, and Hillary Clinton. Claiming he believed it would take months to review Weiner's emails, Comey decided he had to inform Congress that the investigation was being reopened due to new information. Justice Department lawyers warned him that giving out public information about an investigation was inconsistent with department policy, but he considered the policy to be \"guidance\" rather than an ironclad rule. He decided that to not reveal the new information would be misleading to Congress and the public. On October 28, Comey sent a letter to members of Congress advising them that the FBI was reviewing more emails. Members of Congress revealed the information to the public within minutes. Republican and Democratic lawmakers, as well as the Clinton and Trump campaigns, called on Comey to provide additional details.\n\nThe Clinton campaign and numerous former officials and other commentators criticized his decision to announce the reopened investigation. Law professor Richard Painter filed complaints with the United States Office of Special Counsel and the United States Office of Government Ethics over Comey's letter to Congress.\n\nThe investigators received additional resources so they could complete their review of the new emails before Election Day, and on November 6, 2016, Comey wrote in a second letter to Congress that \"Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July\".\n\nComey was broadly criticized for his actions from both the right and the left. According to the Clinton campaign, the letters effectively stopped the campaign's momentum by hurting Clinton's chances with voters who were receptive to Trump's claims of a \"rigged system\". Polling authority Nate Silver commented on Twitter that Comey had a \"large, measurable impact on the race.\" Other analysts, such as Democratic strategist David Axelrod, said that Comey's public actions were just one of several cumulative factors that cost Clinton the election. On May 2, 2017, Hillary Clinton told CNN's Christiane Amanpour: \"I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off.\" On May 3, 2017, Comey testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that it \"makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election,\" but that \"honestly, it wouldn't change the decision\" to release the information.\n\nOn January 12, 2017, the United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General announced a formal investigation into whether the FBI followed proper procedures in its investigation of Clinton or whether \"improper considerations\" were made by FBI personnel.\n\nOn July 27, 2017, the House Judiciary Committee decided to request documents related to Comey, including the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton, Comey's conduct during the 2016 election, and his release of his memo to the press. The committee's Republicans also wrote a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions asking him to appoint a second special prosecutor to investigate these issues.\n\nIn September 2017, two Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), alleged that Comey planned to exonerate Hillary Clinton in her email scandal long before the agency had completed its investigation. The story was confirmed by the FBI in October, which released a Comey memo dated May 2. Comey interviewed Clinton as part of his investigation on July 2. Former FBI official Ron Hosko reacted saying, \"You tend to reach final conclusions as the investigation is logically ended. Not months before.\" Donald Trump called it \"disgraceful.\" In contrast, former Department of Justice spokesman Matthew Miller wrote on Twitter, \"The decision is never 'made' until the end, even when there's a 99% chance it is only going to go one way.\"\n\nComey's original draft of the exoneration stated that Clinton had committed \"gross negligence,\" which is a crime. However, the language was later changed to \"extreme carelessness.\" In December, it was revealed that the change had been made by Peter Strzok, an FBI official who would later join Mueller's probe and be dismissed after exchanging private messages with an FBI lawyer that could be seen as favoring Clinton politically.\n\nOn June 14, 2018, Inspector General Michael Horowitz issued his report criticizing Comey's handling of the Clinton email probe as \"insubordinate\". Specifically, he stated that Comey made \"a serious error in judgment\", \"usurped the authority of the Attorney General,\" \"chose to deviate\" from established procedures, and engaged \"in his own subjective, ad hoc decision making\" by publicly announcing that he wouldn't recommend any charges in the Clinton email investigation in July 2016 and later by sending a letter to Congress about reopening the case. The report found no evidence of political bias, although other high-ranking FBI officials showed \"willingness to take official action\" to negatively impact the Trump campaign.\n\nOn July 5, 2016, the day of Comey's press conference, the FBI acquired the Donald Trump-Russia dossier by Christopher Steele. In late July, the FBI opened an investigation into the Trump campaign. Comey asked President Obama for permission to write an op-ed, which would warn the public that the Russians were interfering in the election. The president denied the request. CIA director John O. Brennan then gave an unusual private briefing on the Russians to Senate minority leader Harry Reid; Reid then publicly referred to the briefing. Comey, however, refused to confirm—even in classified congressional briefings—that the Trump Campaign was under investigation. In early October, meetings were held in the White House Situation Room; National Security Advisor Susan Rice argued that the information should be released, while Comey argued that disclosure was no longer needed.\n\nIn January 2017, Comey first met Trump when he briefed the president-elect on the Steele dossier. On January 27, 2017, Trump and Comey dined alone at the White House. According to Trump, Comey requested the dinner so as to ask to keep his job and, when asked, told Trump that he was not under investigation. Trump has stated that he did not ask Comey to pledge his loyalty. However, according to Comey's associates, Trump requested the dinner, asked Comey to pledge his loyalty, twice, to which Comey replied, twice, that he would always be honest, until Trump asked him if he would promise \"honest loyalty\", which Comey did.\n\nOn February 14, the day after President Trump fired Michael T. Flynn, Comey met with the president during a terrorism threat briefing in the Oval Office. At the end of the meeting Trump asked the other security chiefs to leave, then told Comey to consider imprisoning reporters over leaks and that \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.\" Comey, as is usual, immediately documented the meeting in a memo and shared it with FBI officials. In his congressional testimony, Comey clarified that he took Trump's comment to be \"an order\" to drop the Flynn investigation, but \"that he did not consider this an order to drop the Russia investigation as a whole.\"\n\nOn March 4, Comey asked the Justice Department for permission, which was not given, to publicly refute Trump's claim that his phones had been wiretapped by then-President Obama.\n\nOn March 20, in testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, Comey confirmed that the FBI has been investigating possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia and whether any crimes were committed. During the hearing, the White House Twitter account posted \"The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence the electoral process,\" which Comey, when he was read the tweet by Congressman Jim Himes, directly refuted. Comey also refuted the President's Trump Tower wiretapping allegations, testifying \"I have no information that supports those tweets, and we have looked carefully inside the FBI.\"\n\nU.S. representative Chris Stewart (R-UT) asked Comey in the hearing: \"Mr. Clapper then went on to say that to his knowledge there was no evidence of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. We did not conclude any evidence in our report and when I say 'our report,' that is the NSA, FBI, and CIA with my office, the director of national intelligence said anything – any reflection of collusion between the members of Trump campaign and the Russians, there was no evidence of that in our report. Was Mr. Clapper wrong when he said that?\" Comey responded: \"I think he's right about characterizing the report which you all have read.\" Press Secretary Sean Spicer and a White House tweet then highlighted this testimony as proof that Clapper was \"right\" there was no evidence of collusion, causing Clapper to release a statement clarifying he had been referring to the evidence as gathered in January and that more investigation is needed.\n\nOn May 3, in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Comey said that Russia is the \"greatest threat of any nation on Earth ... One of the biggest lessons learned is that Russia will do this again. Because of 2016 election, they know it worked.\" He also said that Russia should pay a price for interfering.\n\nIn early May, a few days before he was fired, Comey reportedly asked the Justice Department for a significant increase in funding and personnel for the Russia probe. On May 11, 2017, Acting FBI director Andrew McCabe said to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that he was unaware of the request and stated, \"I believe we have the adequate resources to do it and I know that we have resourced that investigation adequately.\"\nComey had been scheduled to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on May 11, but after he was dismissed on May 9, committee chair Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) said that acting FBI director Andrew McCabe would appear instead. Comey spoke before the committee on June 8. His prepared opening statements were pre-released by the Intelligence Committee on their website one day before the official hearings.\n\nIn his July 2013 FBI confirmation hearing, Comey said that the oversight mechanisms of the U.S. government have sufficient privacy protections. In a November 2014 \"New York Times Magazine\" article, Yale historian Beverly Gage reported that Comey keeps on his desk a copy of the FBI request to wiretap Martin Luther King Jr. \"as a reminder of the bureau's capacity to do wrong\".\n\nIn 2016, Comey and his agency were criticized for their request to Apple Inc. to install a \"back door\" for U.S. surveillance agencies to use. Former NSA and CIA director Michael Hayden stated: \"Jim would like a back door available to American law enforcement in all devices globally. And, frankly, I think on balance that actually harms American safety and security, even though it might make Jim's job a bit easier in some specific circumstances.\" Comey, speaking at a cybersecurity conference in 2017, told the audience, \"There is no such thing as absolute privacy in America; there is no place outside of judicial reach.\"\n\nPresident Trump formally dismissed Comey on May 9, 2017, less than 4 years into his 10-year term as Director of the FBI. Comey first learned of his termination from television news reports that flashed on screen while he was delivering a speech to agents at the Los Angeles Field Office. Sources said he was surprised and caught off guard by the termination. Comey immediately departed for Washington, D.C., and was forced to cancel his scheduled speech that night at an FBI recruitment event. Trump reportedly called Deputy Director Andrew McCabe the next day, demanding to know why Comey had been allowed to fly back to Washington on an FBI jet after he had been fired.\n\nOn May 10, Comey sent a letter to FBI staff in which he said, \"I have long believed that a president can fire an FBI director for any reason, or for no reason at all. I'm not going to spend time on the decision or the way it was executed. I hope you won't either. It is done, and I will be fine, although I will miss you and the mission deeply.\" In the absence of a Senate-confirmed FBI director, McCabe automatically became Acting Director.\n\nThe White House initially stated the firing was on the recommendation of United States attorney general Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, to both of whom Comey reported. Rosenstein had sent a memorandum to Sessions, forwarded to Trump, in which Rosenstein listed objections to Comey's conduct in the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. It allowed the Trump administration to attribute Comey's firing to Rosenstein's recommendation about the Clinton email controversy. It was later revealed that on May 8, Trump had requested Sessions and Rosenstein to detail in writing a case against Comey. Rosenstein's memo was forwarded to Trump on May 9 and was then construed as a recommendation to dismiss Comey, which Trump immediately did. In Trump's termination letter to Comey, he attributed the firing to the respective letters from Sessions and Rosenstein. On May 10, Trump told reporters he had fired Comey because Comey \"wasn't doing a good job.\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders added that the FBI rank and file had lost faith in Comey and that she had \"heard from countless members of the FBI ... grateful and thankful for the president's decision.\"\n\nBy May 11, however, in a direct contradiction of the earlier statements by the White House, Vice President Mike Pence, and the contents of the dismissal letter itself, President Trump stated to Lester Holt in an NBC News interview that Comey's dismissal was in fact \"my decision\" and \"I was going to fire [Comey] regardless of recommendation [by Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein].\" Trump later said of the dismissal \"when I decided to just do it [fire Comey], I said to myself, I said 'You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.'\" In the same televised interview, Trump labelled Comey \"a showboat\" and \"grandstander\".\n\nOn May 19, the \"New York Times\" published excerpts of an official White House document summarizing Trump's private meeting, the day after the firing, with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, in the Oval Office. Trump told Kislyak and Lavrov that he \"just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job.\" Trump added: \"I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off\", further adding \"I'm not under investigation.\"\n\nAccording to reports, Trump had been openly talking to aides about finding a reason to fire Comey for at least a week before both the dismissal and the request of memoranda from Sessions and Rosenstein the day prior. Trump was angry and frustrated when, in the week prior to his dismissal, Comey revealed in Senate testimony the breadth of the counterintelligence investigation into Russia's effort to sway the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He felt Comey was giving too much attention to the Russia probe and not enough to internal leaks to the press from within the government. Shortly before Comey was fired, he had requested additional money and resources to further expand the probe into Russian interference into the Presidential election. Trump had long questioned Comey's loyalty to him personally and Comey's judgment to act accordingly. Moreover, Trump was angry that Comey would not support his claim that President Barack Obama had his campaign offices wiretapped.\n\nOn May 16, 2017, it was first reported that Comey had prepared a detailed set of notes following every meeting and telephone call he had with President Trump.\n\nOn May 12, Trump tweeted \"James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!\", which the media, political and legal analysts, as well as opposition politicians, interpreted as a threat to Comey. On June 8, when asked by the Senate Intelligence Committee about the existence of tapes, Comey replied \"Lordy, I hope there are tapes!\" He added that he would have no problem with the public release of any recordings.\n\nOn June 22, after the House Judiciary committee threatened the White House with a potential subpoena for the alleged tapes, Trump issued a tweet stating \"I have no idea [...] whether there are 'tapes' or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings.\" Hours later, when asked to clarify the non-denial denial wording of Trump's tweet regarding the tapes, Principal Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated that Trump's tweet was \"extremely clear\" and that she did \"not have anything to add.\" Questions raised for clarification on Trump's tweet centered principally around whether Trump ever had knowledge of said tapes having ever existed and whether he is simply no longer privy to the knowledge of whether said tapes still exist; whether Trump currently has or ever had knowledge of a person or persons other than Trump having made said tapes or recordings; and whether Trump currently has or ever had knowledge of a person or persons other than Trump currently having or previously having had in their possession said tapes or recordings. U.S. representative Adam Schiff (D-CA), stated that Trump's tweet \"raises as many questions as it answers,\" and that in any event, the tweet did not comply with the June 23 deadline, and that Schiff would move forward with subpoenas for the tapes, adding that \"[r]egardless of whether the President intends his tweets to be an official reply to the House Intelligence Committee, the White House must respond in writing to our committee as to whether any tapes or recordings exist.\"\n\nOn October 4, 2019, allegations of a possible White House recording system resurfaced after House Democrats, who have controlled US House of Representative since the 2018 election, issued a subpoena for White House documents, including any possible audio tapes, following the Trump–Ukraine scandal, setting the stage for a legal battle which could go as far as the US Supreme Court.\n\nComey's termination was immediately controversial. It was compared to the Saturday Night massacre, President Richard Nixon's termination of special prosecutor Archibald Cox, who had been investigating the Watergate scandal, and to the firing of Acting Attorney General Sally Yates in January 2017. Many members of Congress expressed concern over the firing and argued that it would put the integrity of the investigation into jeopardy. Critics accused Trump of obstruction of justice.\n\nIn the dismissal letter, Trump stated that Comey had told him \"on three separate occasions that I am not under investigation.\" Fact checkers reported that while they had no way of knowing what Comey may have told Trump privately, no such assertion was on the public record at that time of Comey directly stating that Trump was not personally under investigation. However, in later Congressional testimony, Comey confirmed that on three occasions he volunteered to Trump that the latter was not personally under FBI investigation.\n\nAccording to Comey associates interviewed by news organizations, Trump had asked Comey in January to pledge loyalty to him, to which Comey demurred, instead offering him \"honesty\". Comey indicated he was willing to testify about his dismissal but only in an open hearing. He declined an invitation from the Senate Intelligence Committee to testify before a closed-door session.\n\nOn May 11, Acting Director McCabe testified before the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that \"Director Comey enjoyed broad support within the FBI and still does\" and that \"the vast majority of FBI employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey\". This contradicted White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who said she had heard from \"countless\" FBI agents in support of the firing.\n\nOn May 16, \"The New York Times\" revealed the existence of a memo Comey had written after a February 14 meeting with Trump. It said that Trump had asked him to drop the FBI's investigation into Mike Flynn, who had been fired as National Security Advisor the day before. Comey later explained that he had arranged, through a friend, for the memo to be shared with the press in hope it might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.\n\nOn June 8, 2017, Comey gave public testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee about his firing. When asked why thought he had been fired, he said he had been confused by the shifting explanations for it but that \"I take the president at his word that I was fired because of the Russia investigation.\" He said that he had made contemporaneous notes about several of his conversations with the president because \"I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting so I felt the need to document it.\" He said he had not done so with the two previous presidents he had served.\n\nOn April 19, 2018, the Justice Department released 15 pages of documents to Congress which comprise partially declassified that Comey made after his meetings with Trump. The memos were released by Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd in both a classified and unclassified versions. The unclassified version was obtained by Mary Clare Jalonick of the Associated Press on April 19 and published the next day.\n\nIn June 2018, DOJ inspector general Michael Horowitz told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had received a referral from the FBI regarding Comey's release of his Trump meeting memos to Daniel Richman, parts of which were classified \"confidential\" after the fact. The DOJ decided in July 2019 to not prosecute Comey, with Fox News quoting one official saying, \"Everyone at the DOJ involved in the decision said it wasn't a close call. They all thought this could not be prosecuted.\"\n\nIn a second report released August 29, 2019, IG Horowitz found that Comey violated agency policies when he retained a set of memos he wrote documenting meetings with President Donald Trump early in 2017, and caused one of them to be leaked to the press. Though Comey is said by the report to have set a \"dangerous example\" for FBI employees in an attempt to \"achieve a personally desired outcome,\" the Inspector General has found \"no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the memos to members of the media\", and the Department of Justice declined to prosecute Comey.\n\nMacmillan Publishers' Flatiron Books announced in August 2017 that it had acquired the rights to Comey's first book, \"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership\", in which he discusses ethics, leadership, and his experience in government. Several publishers had submitted bids in an auction conducted by literary agency Javelin. The release date was moved up from May 1, 2018 to April 17, 2018, due to scrutiny faced by the FBI during the Special Counsel investigation. A month before the book was released, presale orders made it the top seller on Amazon. The boom was attributed to a series of Twitter attacks on Comey by Trump, in which Trump claimed that Comey \"knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!\" In response, Comey tweeted, \"Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon. And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.\" Comey's autobiography was well-received, with \"The New York Times\" calling it \"very persuasive\" and describing the book as \"absorbing\" in its book review, stating \"Comey's memoir offers visceral details on a president untethered to truth.\" Comey confirmed that the Twitter account @projectexile7 (later changed to @formerbu), which uses \"Reinhold Niebuhr\" as its display name, is operated by him. Additionally, Comey has written the foreword for a forthcoming biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt entitled \"A Christian and a Democrat: A Religious Biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt\" published by William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, Comey gave the convocation speech and a series of lectures at Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C., In the fall of 2018, Comey returned to his alma mater, the College of William & Mary, to teach a course on ethical leadership. He became an executive professor in education, a non-tenured position at the College. Comey joined assistant professor Drew Stelljes to teach the course during the 2018–2019 academic year.\n\nIn February 2019, in the midst of controversy surrounding a blackface picture in new Virginia governor Ralph Northam's medical school yearbook, and a national debate about the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials, Comey published an op-ed in the \"Washington Post\", suggesting that Virginia should get rid of the Confederate statues in Richmond: \"Expressing bipartisan horror at blackface photos is essential, but removing the statues would show all of America that Virginia really has changed.\"\n\nIn a May 2019 op-ed published in the \"New York Times\", as Attorney General William Barr was scheduled to be questioned in congressional hearings, Comey wrote: \"Accomplished people lacking inner strength can't resist the compromises necessary to survive Mr. Trump and that adds up to something they will never recover from. It takes character like Mr. Mattis's to avoid the damage, because Mr. Trump eats your soul in small bites.\" He concluded with, \"Of course, to stay, you must be seen as on his team, so you make further compromises. You use his language, praise his leadership, tout his commitment to values. And then you are lost. He has eaten your soul.\"\n\nComey was a registered Republican for most of his life. He donated to Senator John McCain's campaign in the 2008 presidential election and to Governor Mitt Romney's campaign in the 2012 presidential election. He disclosed during congressional testimony in July 2016 that he was no longer registered with any party. In an interview with ABC News in April 2018, Comey said that the Republican Party \"left me and many others,\" and that \"these people don't represent anything [he believes] in.\" In July 2018, Comey urged voters to vote for Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterm elections through Twitter. He wrote, \"This Republican Congress has proven incapable of fulfilling the Founders' design that 'Ambition must ... counteract ambition.' All who believe in this country's values must vote for Democrats this fall. Policy differences don't matter right now. History has its eyes on us.\" He donated to the campaign of Virginia Democratic candidate Jennifer Wexton in the 2018 elections and canvassed for Wexton. He supports Joe Biden for president in 2020.\n\nComey is of Irish descent and was raised in a Roman Catholic household but now belongs to the United Methodist Church, where he has taught Sunday school. He is tall.\n\nComey and his wife, Patrice Failor, are the parents of five children, and a son who died in infancy. He has said that he learned to make something good happen after a tragedy. They have also been foster parents.\n\nTheir oldest daughter, Maurene, graduated from Harvard Law School in 2013 and is currently an assistant U.S. attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.\n\n\n\n"}

Exiting Saint Croix, the highway crosses Route 630 as it begins to parallel a rail line belonging to the New Brunswick Southern Railway through rural York County.

The highway turns more northerly through town then turns to the south before straightening out more in a more northeasterly direction again, entering more woodlands. Route 4 traverses the small community of Christie Ridge before terminating at an intersection with Route 3 in Thomaston Corner.\n\nBetween McAdam and St. Croix, Route 4 follows the bed of one of New Brunswick's first railways, a wooden line built by a lumberman named Todd who wanted to transport his logs to the Saint Croix River.

In 1997, the station was sold to Lambert Broadcasting, LLC. It added The WB in 1999 as a secondary affiliation; two years later, WFLI dropped UPN and became a full-time WB affiliate. The Meredith Corporation acquired WFLI in 2004.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2003, the station sold late-night Saturday paid programming time to an independent producer, out of which eventually arose the format and style of Fuel TV (now Fox Sports 2), which went by that name on WFLI.

The Woods family has a strong tradition of service at the College of Arms. Albert Woods was the son of Sir William Woods, Garter King of Arms from 1838 until his death in 1842. Likewise, the grandson of Albert Woods was Sir Gerald Woods Wollaston, who also rose to the rank of Garter King of Arms and served there from 1930 until 1944.\n\nWoods' first heraldic appointment came in 1837 when he served as Fitzalan Pursuivant of Arms Extraordinary at the coronation of Queen Victoria. In 1838 Woods became a member of the chapter of the College of Arms when he was appointed Portcullis Pursuivant of Arms in Ordinary. After a short appointment as Norfolk Herald of Arms Extraordinary, Woods was promoted to the office of Lancaster Herald of Arms in Ordinary in 1841. He held this position until 1869, when he was appointed Garter Principal King of Arms, a position he held until his death 35 years later.\n\nFrom 1866, Woods was registrar of the College of Arms. At his appointment as Garter Principal King of Arms, he was also named the King of Arms of the Order of St Michael and St George. In 1878, he was made registrar of the Order of the Star of India and the Order of the Indian Empire. He officiated at the coronations both of Queen Victoria and of Edward VII.\n\nWoods's eye for heraldic design has been deprecated by some heraldists. In his \"Complete Guide to Heraldry\", Arthur Fox-Davies refers to his designs as \"wretched\", \"unsuitable\" and \"abortions\". He is particularly critical of the crests granted by Woods, which frequently incorporated tree trunks, either in front of the crest or underneath it, a practice Davies considered unheraldic.\n\nWoods was responsible for the compilation of the important unpublished ordinary of arms (a systematic register of coats of arms) known as \"Garter's Ordinaries\". He began work on it in 1842 and continued until his death in 1904. By that date the ordinary comprised two series, one of five and the other of six volumes, plus indexes. Following his death it was donated to the College of Arms by his grandson, Gerald Woods Wollaston: since then, subsequent Garter Kings of Arms have added to it and kept it up to date by including within it new grants of arms. It remains in use: Sir Anthony Wagner has described it as \"an indispensable tool at the College\".\n\n\n\n"}

The first of the family, the EF 24–70mm f/2.8L, was introduced in 2002 to replace the well-regarded 28–70mm f/2.8L. Two later versions were announced in 2012. The first of these, the EF 24–70mm f/2.8L II, was announced by Canon in February, but would not ship to customers until September of that year. This lens replaced the Mk I, and had an MSRP of US$2299 when introduced. The latest member of the family is the EF 24–70mm f/4L IS USM, which became available in January 2014. The f/4 version, which is the first of the family to include image stabilization, was initially reported to be the standard kit lens for the Canon EOS 6D, but did not appear in 6D kits in most markets until late 2014, and 5D Mark IV kit in 2016.\n\nLike its predecessor, the f/2.8 Mk I lens was often considered to have excellent contrast, color rendition and decent sharpness wide open. However, some samples of this lens have also been reported to exhibit deficiencies and operational problems not present in the older 28–70mm lens, including poor sharpness and/or chromatic aberration. According to the head of a US lens rental firm, the f/2.8 Mk I lens \"definitely has some reliability issues and a lot of copy-to-copy variation, at least some of which relate to its design.\"\n\nEarly reports on the f/2.8 Mk II indicated significant improvement in optical quality. The aforementioned rental firm head stated, \nAll versions of the lens include sealing against dust and water, although they are not waterproof. The f/2.8 Mk I includes an 8-bladed curved diaphragm, while both the f/2.8 Mk II and f/4 include a 9-bladed curved diaphragm. The diaphragm of the f/2.8 Mk I remains nearly circular from f/2.8 to f/5.6, according to the Canon Press release from 2002. Characteristic of zoom lenses, it exhibits some barrel distortion at its shortest focal length.\n\nAn unusual aspect of the f/2.8 Mk I lens (and the 28–70mm f/2.8L) is that its barrel extends as it zooms toward its shortest focal length. When used with the supplied lens hood, which attaches to a non-moving part of the lens, this extension results in a properly matched shade at every angle of view. Most zoom lens hoods are designed for only the widest angle of view, offering progressively inadequate shade at longer focal lengths.\n\nThis reverse zoom is illustrated with the following two pictures:\nAt the telephoto end (70 mm), the end of the lens is the most retracted providing the most shade protection from the lens hood.\nAt the widest end (24 mm), the end of the lens is the most protruding providing the least shade protection from the lens hood.\n\nThe f/2.8 Mk II lens, however, has a more conventional design, with the barrel extending as the focal length increases. The lens hood is much shorter than that of the Mk I version. The f/4 lens shares the same conventional design.\n\nThe f/2.8 versions are not true 1x macro lenses (1:1); the f/2.8 Mk I has a maximum magnification of only 0.29x and the f/2.8 Mk II has 0.21x. The f/4 lens, while also not a true macro lens, is considerably closer to being in that category.

Robert Wodrow was born at Glasgow, where his father, James Wodrow, was a professor of divinity. Robert was educated at the university and was librarian from 1697 to 1701. From 1703 till his death, he was parish minister at Eastwood, near Glasgow. He had sixteen children, his son Patrick being the \"auld Wodrow\" of Burns's poem \"Twa Herds\".\n\nRobert Wodrow was the youngest son of James Wodrow, Professor of Divinity, at the University of Glasgow. He was born in the Trongate there, April (or September) 1679. At the very hour of his birth, soldiers under warrant of the Privy Council, were searching the house to seize his father, but the \nlatter, having exchanged clothes with the physician's man-servant, succeeded in escaping. Wodrow entered the University of Glasgow in 1691, and graduated with an M.A. on 18 January 1697. He served as chaplain in the house of his kinsman, Sir John Maxwell of Pollok, and for several years he was librarian to the University of Glasgow. On 6 January 1703, he was licenced by the Presbytery of Paisley, and ordained to Eastwood on 28 October of that year. In 1707 he was one of a Committee of Presbyterians appointed to consult and act with the Commission in Edinburgh as to the best means of averting the evils with which the Union of the Kingdoms seemed to threaten the church and people \nof Scotland. On the accession of George I. in 1714, he was principal correspondent and adviser of the five ministers sent by the Assembly to London to plead the rights of the Church, and particularly to \npetition for the abolition of patronage. He assisted Principal Hadow in drawing up the Act of Assembly (1731) for the filling up of vacant parishes, the passing of which in the following year gave rise to \nthe Associate Presbytery. He declined calls to Glasgow in 1712, to Stirling in 1717, and again in 1726. He died on 21 March 1734. An enthusiastic collector of information on the history and personal ministry of the Church, he left behind him a vast accumulation of interesting and illuminative MSS. many of which were printed by the Wodrow Society (1841–50), the Maitland and other Clubs. The Wodrow MSS. are preserved in the Advocates Library, and the Library of the University of Glasgow\n\nHe married November 1708, Margaret (died 27 January 1758), widow of Ebenezer Veitch, minister of Ayr, and daughter of Patrick Warner of Ardeer, minister of Irvine, and had issue Janet, born 1710, buried 5 April 1773 [\"Her days and nights were devoted to the poor, to whom she gave her personal but unostentatious attendance\"]; Robert, his successor in Eastwood; Patrick, minister of Tarbolton; James, minister of Stevenston; Alexander, settled in America, had an estate there, and died about the end of the first American War; Mary, died unmarried; Margaret (married Matthew Biggar, minister of Kirkoswald) ; Marion, died unmarried; Martha, and six others died early.\n\nWodrow's major work, \"The History of the Sufferings of the Church of Scotland from the Restoration to the Revolution\", was published in two volumes in 1721–1722 (new ed. with a life of Wodrow by Robert Burns, DD, 1807–1808). This recorded and denounced the persecution of the Covenanters after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, including what he called \"The Killing Times\" . He was one of the first historians to use \"publick records, original papers, and manuscripts of that time\" and included many first hand accounts of this period in the history of the Church of Scotland, producing a martyrology that the church would turn to again at times of suffering. The work was approved by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and dedicated to George I, who recognised its semi-official character by, on 26 April 1725, authorising the payment out of the exchequer of 100 guineas to Wodrow.\n\nAs an apprentice, the soon-to-be prominent London bookseller Andrew Millar sent Wodrow book price-lists. As a friend of Millar's father, Wodrow may have helped to apprentice Millar to James McEuen, who was also his friend.\n\nWodrow also wrote a \"Life\" (1828) of his father. He left two other works in manuscript: \"Memoirs of Reformers and Ministers of the Church of Scotland\", and \"Analecta: or Materials for a History of Remarkable Providences, mostly relating to Scotch Ministers and Christians\". Of the former, two volumes were published by the Maitland Club in 1834–1845 and one volume by the New Spalding Club in 1890; the latter was published in four volumes by the Maitland Club in 1842–1843.\n\nWodrow left a great mass of correspondence, three volumes of which, edited by Thomas McCrie, appeared in 1842–1843. The Wodrow Society, founded in Edinburgh to perpetuate his memory, was in existence from 1841 to 1847, several works being published under its auspices.\n\n\n\n"}

Her most notable positions were Vice President for Action of The National Organization of Women (NOW) starting in 1990 and Director for the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy.\n\nDempsey earned her B.A in Sociology from the College of New Rochelle in 1967, which was a private, all women's Catholic college. It is known as the first Catholic women's college in New York State when it was founded in 1904. In the Fall of 2016, the College of New Rochelle admitted men for the first time. Later she earned her Juris Doctor from Rutgers University Law School. As a young student, she began her activist career speaking out during the civil rights movement in the 1960s and participating in anti-war protests.\n\n\nDempsey studied law and worked in the criminal justice system. She practiced law for 12 years in New Jersey, where she founded the feminist law firm McGahen, Dempsey and Case. She became interested in the women's movement in the 1960s because it affected her and every other woman. She came across NOW in 1970 and has played an active role in the organization since. She played a vital role in the chartering of the New Jersey Chapter of NOW in 1973 where she served as their first president. She says, \"[NOW] came along at a time in my life when I had little children, and I needed to connect with some meaningful movement.\"\n\nNOW was founded in June 1966. It started as 28 women who attended the Third National Conference of Commissions on the Status of Women in DC. Today, NOW is the largest women's rights organization in the U.S. NOW has worked toward women's equality and dignity. To do so, they have gone up against issues such as discrimination in education, credit, and employment. NOW also works to help the reputation of women who choose to stay at home, and have helped to elevate their voices. NOW has also fought for the rights of women in marriage and divorce.\n\nDempsey was Vice President of the organization during a tumultuous time for women's rights, and was at the forefront of many key feminists movements.\n\nDuring her time with NOW, she travelled around the country on a speaking tour to talk about feminist issues. Some colleges on this tour included Penn State, Franklin and Marshall College, the University of Pennsylvania, Haverford College, and Carnegie Mellon University. A main topic during this tour was the wage gap for women. At this time women were making 58% of what men made, so it was at the forefront of NOW's work.\n\nDempsey was also Vice President of NOW when Justice Clarence Thomas was nominated as a Supreme Court Justice. She was quoted saying that Thomas' hearing was a \"collective click\" for women all over the nation.\n\nDempsey helped plan the \"We Won't Go Back!\" March for Women's Lives in Washington DC that took place on April 5, 1992. This march was sponsored by NOW, and advocated for abortion rights in America. This walk had over half a million attendees, and was organized to impress lawmakers and the public during a time when the Supreme Court was hearing a case that had the ability to severely limit women's rights. The New York Times wrote an article that day outlining the dangers of the Supreme Court Case.On April 22, the High Court will hear arguments on a Pennsylvania law that seeks to limit access to abortion through a variety of regulations, including a 24-hour waiting period and a requirement that women seeking abortions notify their husbands. Many people on both sides see that case as a potential vehicle for overturning Roe v. Wade. Meanwhile, some states have adopted even stricter limits.The Supreme Court case \"Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Robert P. Casey\" was a landmark case that reaffirmed \"Roe v. Wade\" to secure abortion rights to women. This case sparked the March on Washington, and attracted many women, including celebrities and students from around the nation. A similar march took place in Los Angeles a week later.\n\nIn 1991, there were roughly 1 million incidents reported of domestic violence towards women, and another 3 million incidents were predicted as unreported. Domestic violence had become so common in society at the time that it had been named the top health risk against women. She was a founding member of \"New Jersey Women Take Back the Night,\" an organization that helped to generate public awareness for violence against women. This group also lobbied legislators to gain support for the movement to stop violence against women, and create laws to protect women. This was the start to the idea of the Violence Against Women Act. She has also supported women who have faced domestic violence through her work to create a battered women's shelter in New Jersey called Womanspace.\n\nBeing an openly gay women, she also advocated for gay rights. During this time, gay couples were not able to have the same rights and privileges as heterosexual married couples. This meant they were barred from the hospital rooms where their partners were being treated, or they were thrown out of their houses after their partners' death. They did not have the same protections as their heterosexual counterparts. Dempsey was a lawyer in many cases revolving around these issues, and fought for equal rights for gay people. She also chaired a coalition to pass lesbian and gay rights legislation in New Jersey.\n\nDempsey traveled to Tokyo in 1996 to raise awareness about a sexual harassment issue between Mitsubishi and hundreds of women that were employed by them. Dempsey was doing a lot of talking during her trip with many officials from Tokyo including Mitsubishi Motors representatives. With her help and others, the EEOC, sued Mitsubishi which eventually agreed to pay $34 million in a settlement.\n\nDempsey was born in Connecticut in 1946, and earned her bachelor's degree in New York before moving to New Jersey for law school. She did most of her activist work out of New Jersey, and raised her two children there as well who were born in 1971 and 1972.\n\nShe gained national media attention after gaining full custody of her two children even though she was openly gay in 1979. This made it easier for future homosexual couples looking to gain legal custody of their children. She and her long-time partner, Kim Costanza, owned a gay restaurant, bar and guest house in Pass-A-Grille, Florida that has since been closed.\n"}
{"id": "2156756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156756", "title": "Tan line", "text": "Tan line\n\nA tan line is a visually clear division on the human skin between an area of pronounced comparative paleness relative to other areas that have been suntanned by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The source of the radiation may be the sun, or artificial UV sources such as tanning lamps. Tan lines are usually an inadvertent result of a work environment or of recreational activities, but are sometimes intentional. Many people regard visible tan lines as un-aesthetic, and seek to avoid tan lines that will be visible when regular clothes are worn.\n\nA \"farmer's tan\" (also called \"golfer's tan\" or \"tennis tan\") refers to the typical tan lines developed by regular outdoor activity when wearing a short sleeve shirt. The farmer's tan usually starts with a suntan covering the exposed parts of the arms and neck. It is distinct in that the shoulders, chest, and back remain unaffected by the sun. Tennis and golf additionally cause recognizable tans on the middle section of the legs, due to the wearing of shorts and socks for prolonged hours in the sun.\n\nThe \"Texas tan\" is similar, with the exception that the shoulders are also affected by the sun, caused by working outdoors while wearing a sleeveless shirt.\n\nSome of the common tan lines associated with a farmer's tan include:\n\nA \"driver's tan\" (or similar terms such as \"trucker's tan\" or \"taxi driver's arm\") is a tanning pattern where one arm from the sleeve downward is tanned significantly more than the other arm, due to extensive driving of a motor vehicle with the window down. \n\nA \"sandal tan\" is a set of distinctive tan lines on the feet, resulting from the straps of sandals worn throughout the summer by such different professions as lifeguards and monks.\n\nWearing a bikini in the sun results in the uncovered skin becoming suntanned and creates a \"bikini tan\". These tan lines separate pale breasts, crotch, and buttocks from otherwise tanned skin. \"Racing stripes\" may refer to the portion of a bikini tan line exposed when wearing one-piece swimwear.\n\nA \"biker's tan\" is a tan line three-quarters up each leg, where lycra bike shorts would normally begin to cover. Depending on the activity, the inner side of the arms may be paler than the outer side. Unless the biker uses cycling gloves made to allow tanning, the area on the back of each hand will usually not be tanned.\n\nRaccoon-like tan lines can emerge around the eyes after wearing goggles, common among industrial workers (wearing safety glasses), skiers, snowboarders, and swimmers.\n\n\nOne of the common uses for tanning beds is the option of tanning completely nude to reduce the appearance of tan lines. In contrast, some people prefer to have tan lines, and will wear undergarments or swimwear with the deliberate purpose of creating a sharply defined tan line.\n\nAdditionally, \"tanning stickers\" can be purchased that attach to the skin while tanning. Common designs are a heart, Playboy bunny, and dolphins; but many different designs exist. These are typically sold on a roll of 500 to 1000 as single-use, disposable stickers. People can place the sticker on the same area each time they tan (indoors or outdoors) and this will leave the covered area pale, while the rest of their skin tans normally. This allows individuals to see their tanning progress, and allows others to see as well if the \"tan tattoo\" is in an exposed area.\n\nIt is also possible to use sunscreen to create intentional tan lines that form patterns or words, to make a statement or simply create a design.\n\nThe wearing of clothes while tanning results in creation of tan lines, which many people regard as un-aesthetic. Many people want to avoid tan lines on those parts of the body which will be visible when they are fully clothed. Some people try to achieve an all-over tan or to maximize their tan coverage. To achieve an all-over tan, tanners need to dispense with clothing; and to maximize coverage, they need to minimize the amount of clothing they wear while tanning. For women who cannot dispense with a swimsuit, they at times tan with the back strap undone while lying on the front, or removing shoulder straps, besides wearing swimsuits which cover less area than their normal clothing. Any exposure is subject to local community standards and personal choice. Some people tan in the privacy of their backyard where they can at times tan without clothes, and some countries have set aside clothing-optional swimming areas (popularly known as nude beaches), where people can tan and swim clothes-free. Some people tan topless, and others wear very brief swimwear, such as a microkini or thong.\nA 1969 innovation is tan-through swimwear, which uses fabric perforated with thousands of micro holes that are nearly invisible to the naked eye, but which transmit enough sunlight to approach an all-over tan, especially if the fabric is stretched taut. Tan-through swimwear typically allows more than one-third of UV rays to pass through (equivalent to SPF 3 or less), and an application of sunscreen even to the covered area is recommended.\n"}

However, the numeric designation is strictly coincidental, and Route 16 is not part of that route.\n\nRoute 16 begins in Aulac at a T intersection with the Aulac Road; this road having been the original alignment of Route 2 until a 4-lane alignment opened in the early 1990s. Approximately east of Aulac Road, Route 16 interchanges with Route 2 in a cloverleaf interchange, one of only three grade-separated interchanges on the entire route.\n\nRoute 16 continues east from Aulac as an uncontrolled access 2-lane highway passing through the following communities in rural Westmorland County while paralleling the New Brunswick-Nova Scotia inter-provincial border: Point de Bute, Upper Point de Bute, Jolicure, Halls Hill, and Baie Verte Road.\n\nThe first major intersection on Route 16 east of Aulac is a T intersection with Main Street just west of the community of Baie Verte. Main Street is a former alignment of Route 16 and connects with Route 970 in the community of Baie Verte; this alignment was bypassed during a realignment of Route 16 around Baie Verte and Port Elgin in the 1960s.\n\nRoute 16 continues east on this bypass alignment through Coburg before entering Port Elgin where it interchanges directly with Route 970 and the eastern terminus of Route 15 in a roundabout interchange called the Port Elgin Rotary. The 1960s bypass reconnects with the original alignment of Route 16 at a T intersection with East Main Street on the east side of Port Elgin.\n\nRoute 16 continues east from Port Elgin as an uncontrolled access 2-lane highway passing through the following communities on the Cape Tormentine peninsula: Timber River (where it intersects Route 960), Hardy, Melrose, and Malden.\n\nAt Malden the highway intersects with Immigrant Road in a T intersection. Immigrant Road serves Bayfield and Cape Tormentine and is the original alignment of Route 16 from Malden to Cape Tormentine before the Confederation Bridge opened on May 31, 1997.\n\nFrom Malden to the eastern terminus at the abutment of the Confederation Bridge in Cape Jourimain, Route 16 is a controlled access 2-lane highway running on a alignment that opened in 1997. It intersects Route 955 in a grade-separated diamond interchange approximately west of Bayfield.\n\nThe final interchange on Route 16 is also grade separated and provides access to the Cape Jourimain Nature Centre approximately west of the Confederation Bridge. Traffic leaves Route 16 when entering the Confederation Bridge to cross the Northumberland Strait to Prince Edward Island before continuing on Trans-Canada Highway Route 1.\n\nPort Elgin is the only major community along the route.\n\nThis highway has been part of the New Brunswick highway network since the Canadian National Railways ferry service from Cape Tormentine NB to Borden PEI began accepting automobiles in the 1920s.\n\nThe original section from Aulac to Baie Verte was known as the Baie Verte Road, the section through Baie Verte and Port Elgin was known as Main Street, the section from Port Elgin to Bayfield was known as the Immigrant Road, and the section from Bayfield to Cape Tormentine (now part of Route 955) was known as the Bayfield Road. The Trans-Canada Highway and Route 16 designation was applied in the 1960s after the Bayfield and Baie Verte/Port Elgin realignments.\n\nThere have been three major realignments to the route:\n\n"}

In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Smertrios for this planet. The winning name was submitted by the Club d'Astronomie de Toussaint of France. Smertrios was a Gallic deity of war.\n\nThe planet was discovered by the N2K Consortium in 2005, which searches stars for closely orbiting giant planets similar to 51 Pegasi b using the highly successful radial velocity method. The spectrum of the star was studied from the Keck and Subaru Telescopes. After the planet was first detected from the Doppler effect it caused in the light of the host star, it was studied for transits at the Fairborn Observatory. A tiny decrease of light (0.003 magnitudes) was detected every time the planet was transiting the star, thus confirming its existence.\n\nAlthough the change of brightness caused by the transiting planet is tiny, it is detectable by amateur astronomers, providing an opportunity for amateurs to make important astronomical contributions. Indeed, one amateur astronomer, Ron Bissinger, actually detected a partial transit a day before the discovery was published.\n\nThe planet's orbit is probably circular (within one standard deviation of error).\n\nThe planet orbits the star in a so-called \"torch orbit\". One revolution around the star takes only a little less than three Earth days to complete. The planet is less massive than Jupiter (0.36 times Jupiter's mass, or 114 times Earth's mass) but more massive than Saturn. The temperature of the planet was initially estimated on the basis of 0.3 Bond albedo to be about 1540 K, above the predicted temperature of HD 209458 b (1400K), which had inaugurated the category of Chthonian \"hell planet\". Its day-side brightness temperature was subsequently directly measured as 2,300 ± 200 K by comparing the combined emissions of star and planet at 8 μm wavelength before and during a transit event. This is around the boiling point of silicon and well above the melting point of iron.\n\nThis planet's albedo has not been measured directly. The initial estimate of 0.3 had come from averaging Sudarsky's theoretical classes IV and V. The planet's extremely high temperature has forced astronomers to abandon that estimate; now, they predict that the planet must absorb essentially all of the starlight that falls on it — that is, effectively zero albedo like HD 209458 b. Much of the absorption takes place at the top of its atmosphere.\n\nBetween that and the hot, high-pressure gas surrounding the core, a stratosphere of cooler gas was once predicted but has not been observed. The atmosphere is likely high in carbon monoxide and dioxide.\n\nThe outer shell of dark, opaque, hot clouds are usually thought to be vanadium and titanium oxides (\"pM planets\"), but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out as yet.\n\nThe planet-star radius ratio is 0.05158 +/- 0.00077. Currently what limits more precision on HD 149026 b's radius \"is the uncertainty in the stellar radius\", and measurement of the stellar radius is distorted by pollution on the star's surface.\n\nEven allowing for uncertainty the radius of HD 149026 b is only about three quarters that of Jupiter (or 83% that of Saturn). HD 149026 b was the first of its kind: HD 149026 b's low volume means that the planet is too dense for a Saturn-like gas giant of its mass and temperature.\n\nIt may have an exceptionally large core composed of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium: the initial theoretical models gave the core a mass of 70 times Earth's mass; further refinements suggest 80-110 Earth masses. As a result, the planet has been described as a \"super-Neptune\", in analogy to the core-dominated outer ice giants of our solar system, though whether the core of HD 149026 b is mainly icy or rocky is not currently known. Robert Naeye in \"Sky & Telescope\" claimed \"it contains as much or more heavy elements (elements heavier than hydrogen and helium) than all the planets and asteroids in our solar system combined\". In addition to uncertainties of radius, its tidal heating over its history needs be taken into account; if its current orbit is circular and if that had evolved from a more eccentric one, the extra heat increases its expected radius per its model and thereby its core radius.\n\nNaeye further speculated that the gravity could be as high as ten \"g\" (ten times gravity on Earth's surface) on the surface of the core.\n\nThe discovery was advocated as a piece of evidence for the popular solar nebula accretion model, where planets are formed from the accretion of smaller objects. In this model, giant planet embryos grow large enough to acquire large envelopes of hydrogen and helium. However, opponents of this model emphasize that only one example of such a dense planet is not proof. In fact, such a huge core is difficult to explain even by the core accretion model.\n\nOne possibility is that because the planet orbits so close to its star, it is — unlike Jupiter — ineffective in cleansing the planetary system of rocky bodies. Instead, a heavy rain of heavier elements on the planet may have helped create the large core.\n\nCareful radial velocity measurements have made it possible to detect the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect, the shifting in photospheric spectral lines caused by the planet occulting a part of the rotating stellar surface. This effect allows the measurement of the angle between the planet's orbital plane and the equatorial plane of the star. In the case of HD 149026 b, the alignment was measured to be +11° ± 14°. This in turn suggests that the formation of the planet was peaceful and probably involved interactions with the protoplanetary disc. A much larger angle would have suggested a violent interplay with other protoplanets. As of August 2008 this is still the canonical measurement.\n\n\n"}

His most notable work focuses on scenes of Native American life, particularly of the Pueblo Indians.\n\nUfer was born in Germany and moved with his family to Louisville, Kentucky in 1880 where Ufer grew up. After an apprenticeship as a lithographer, he went to Europe where he was a traveling journeyman. Like many of his fellow artists with ties to Indianapolis's German-American community, he went to Germany to study; he trained in Hamburg and Dresden. When he returned to America, he worked as a printer in Chicago and taught school, and later took classes in fine arts. After a brief time in Chicago, he returned to Munich in 1911 for further study as an artist. Upon his return to the US, he traveled to Taos in 1914. There he became one of the \"Taos Ten\", and associated with the Taos Society of Artists. In 1917 Ufer served as president of Chicago's Palette and Chisel, Academy of Fine Arts.\n\nIn addition to his art, Ufer is known for his social activism. He helped victims of the 1918 flu epidemic being treated in the local schoolhouse and collected money for miners on strike in Madrid, New Mexico. He was also a member of the International Workers of the World and follower of Leon Trotsky.\n\nUfer died from appendicitis. At his request, he was cremated and his ashes were spread in an \"arroyo\" (creek) near Mabel Dodge Luhan's house in Taos.\n\nIn the 1920s, Ufer's work garnered critical and commercial success. He showed at the Carnegie International, and became an Academician of the National Academy of Design. Ufer's New Mexico paintings are characterized by genre scenes of Native American life and landscapes executed in a high-keyed palette. One of his favorite models was a Taos Indian named Jim Mirabal who was often referred to as \"Ufer's Jim.\"\n\nMuseums with his work include the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, New Mexico Museum of Art, Taos Art Museum (at Fechin House) and the Indianapolis Museum of Art.\n\n\n"}

ACICS was established in 1912. It accredited 245 institutions of higher education offering undergraduate and graduate diplomas and degrees in both traditional formats and through distance education. ACICS is incorporated in Virginia and operates from offices in Washington, D.C. Concerns about the quality of its accreditation led the U.S. Department of Education to withdraw the accreditor's recognition in 2016. A subsequent lawsuit and review led the next Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, to retain the institution's recognition (although the Council for Higher Education Accreditation withdrew the organization's membership).\n\nACICS was established upon the request of Benjamin Franklin Williams, President of Capital City Commercial College of Des Moines, Iowa. Upon the meeting of 22 school administrators, who met in Chicago, Illinois, on December 12, 1912, the original alliance formed the basis of National Association of Accredited Commercial Schools (NAACS), which was later renamed ACICS.\n\nThe scope of ACICS' recognition by the Department of Education and CHEA is defined as accreditation of private post-secondary educational institutions, both for-profit and non-profit, offering nondegree programs or associate degrees, bachelor's degrees and master's degrees in programs \"designed to train and educate persons for professional, technical, or occupational careers.\"\n\nAs an accreditor for many for-profit colleges, ACICS provided information during U.S. Congressional investigations of for-profit education in 2010. ACICS reported that the institutions it accredits are required to demonstrate a student retention rate of at least 75 percent. Retention rates are calculated within a single academic year.\n\nIn 2015, ACICS fell under significant scrutiny after the collapse of Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit institution that was accredited by ACICS until its sudden demise. A subcommittee of the United States Senate requested information from ACICS in November 2015. Five months later, twelve state attorneys general requested that the U.S. Department of Education withdraw recognition from ACICS as a federally-recognized accreditor. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau petitioned a federal court to order ACICS to make available information about \"its decision to approve several controversial for-profit college chains\", and the president of the organization, Al Gray, resigned.\n\nScrutiny continued in 2016 and intensified after another large chain of for-profit institutions accredited by ACICS, ITT Technical Institute, came under fire by state and federal agencies; the chain closed in 2016 and filed for bankruptcy. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a prominent critic of ACICS, released a report critical of the accreditor in June. Several days later, the U.S. Department of Education formally recommended that the accreditor's recognition be withdrawn. In September 2016, the chief of staff to the U.S. education secretary wrote in a letter to ACICS: \"I am terminating the department's recognition of ACICS as a national recognized accrediting agency. ... ACICS's track record does not inspire confidence that it can address all of the problems effectively.\" The company immediately announced that it would appeal the decision within the 30 days allowed for appeal, to Education Secretary John King Jr. ACICS unsuccessfully appealed the decision and subsequently sued the Department of Education. Although Secretary of Education King finalized the process of revoking the U.S. Department of Education's recognition of ACICS as an accreditor in December 2016, ACICS's lawsuit resulted in a judge ordering Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to review the decision in March 2018 as King did not take into account all of the evidence; DeVos subsequently restored the accreditor's recognition by the Department of Education.\n\nAlthough the Department of Education continued to recognize the accreditor, many institutions left the organization while its status was in question. At the same time, many institutions formerly accredited by ACICS closed. This loss in membership, combined with the legal costs associated with the lawsuits and legal proceedings, placed the organization into financial difficulties including a $2.1 million deficit in 2019. Although the Department of Education restored its recognition of ACICS following its lawsuit, CHEA did not and ACICS withdrew its application to CHEA in early 2020.\n\nWhether ACICS deserves to be accredited has again been called into question by an investigation by \"USA Today\" that found that ACICS had accredited a school, Reagan National University, that appears to be a sham. According to this report, Reagan National University has no campus, faculty, current students, or alumni.\n\n"}

The station is owned by New Age Media, which also operates Cleveland-licensed dual CW/MyNetworkTV affiliate WFLI-TV (channel 53) under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with owner MPS Media, LLC. Both stations, in turn, are operated under a master service agreement by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, making them sisters to Chattanooga-licensed dual ABC/Fox affiliate WTVC (channel 9).\n\nWDSI and WFLI share studios on East Main Street (SR 8/US 41/US 76) in Chattanooga's Highland Park section; master control and some internal operations for the two stations are based at WTVC's facilities on Benton Drive in Chattanooga. WDSI-TV's transmitter is located on Signal Mountain in the town of Walden.\n\nThe station signed on the air on January 24, 1972 with the call letters WRIP-TV. It aired an analog signal on UHF channel 61. It was Tennessee's second independent outlet having launched a little over nine months after the state's first Independent, WMCV in Nashville, went off the air but only to return in 1976 as WZTV. It is the state's oldest television station in continuous operation to have never had affiliation with any of the big three networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC). The station was owned by Jay Sadow.\n\nInitially, WRIP was positioned as an all-movie station. Therefore, early programming on WRIP included older movies from the 1930s to early 1960s for most of its broadcast day along with some theatrical cartoons and shorts. These selections included \"Little Rascals\", \"Three Stooges\", and \"Looney Tunes\". The station was on-the-air for about twelve hours a day signing on at noon. By the summer the station was on 19 hours a day signing on at 7 a.m.\n\nThe station was plagued by financial problems for several reasons. It was a UHF station serving a small market in a very mountainous area. In analog days, UHF stations, especially those on high channel numbers, usually did not get good reception more than about away in rugged terrain. Also, the station was losing money because it overspent on movie packages. The station was locally owned and its owner did not have the money to spend on any other programming investments. In the course of 1973, WRIP-TV gradually shifted to a somewhat traditional independent station schedule of programs but with a low-budget approach.\n\nBy 1974, it added low-budget cartoons, low-budget syndicated shows such as wildlife and sporting shows, and locally based religious shows. That year, the station completely eliminated movies as well as cutting hours on the air, signing on at 3 p.m. and off the air by midnight. In the fall of 1974 it expanded the broadcast day slightly and added a run of the ninety-minute edition of \"The 700 Club\" in 1975 and two runs of the two-hour version of the \"PTL Club\". The station then began selling huge blocks of time to mostly churches in the local area cutting back more on low-budget secular shows.\n\nBy 1976, the station was running mostly Christian programs about twelve hours a day along with some low-budget secular programs such as children's programs (including \"The New Zoo Revue\", \"Devlin\", and \"Gigantor\"), outdoor sporting and hunting shows, \"The Mike Douglas Show\", as well as some low budget instructional shows about four hours a day. The station was basically profitable by selling thirty- and sixty-minute blocks of time most of the day to local religious broadcasters.\n\nBy 1978, WRIP was running Christian programs (both local and syndicated) for all except a couple of hours a day. The station produced and scheduled many hours per day of programs from local churches. By 1980, it was running nearly all religious shows (again half local and half syndicated) with an hour or so a day set aside for a couple of secular shows. In fall 1981, it began adding additional secular shows in the 3 to 6 p.m. time slot, bringing back \"Gigantor\" and \"Bullwinkle\" as well as youth-appeal shows such as \"Super Friends\", \"Little Rascals\", \"McHale's Navy\", \"Make Room For Daddy\", \"The Brady Bunch\", and\" Leave It To Beaver\", among others. Weekends, the station added shows like \"The Hardy Boys\", \"Those Amazing Animals\", \"America's Top 10\", and others. In winter 1982, the station expanded secular programming to the 2 to 8 p.m. weekday timeslots as well as the 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. time slot. Shows added included off network dramas such as \"Kojak\", \"Star Trek\"; sitcoms such as \"I Love Lucy\", and \"Munsters\" along with some movies. The station was about half religious and half secular. That summer, the station added a prime time movie and was secular from about 1 p.m. to 1 a.m. That fall, more cartoons such as \"Scooby-Doo\", \"Bugs Bunny\", \"The Flintstones\" were added along with some more movies and by now the station was two-thirds secular and one-third religious. For the first time since the mid-1970s, the station was secular a few hours a day on Sundays as well.\n\nIt seemed like it was being spruced up for a sale, because in January 1983, Jay Sadow sold the station to Roy Hess. The station immediately changed its call sign to the current WDSI-TV. It modified its then-hybrid religious/general entertainment format (which was leaning more on entertainment for the first time since about 1975) adding cartoons in the 7 to 9 a.m. time slot. The religious shows remained in the late mornings, but in the early afternoons, more old movies were added along with holdover classic sitcoms. Cartoons, older sitcoms, and drama shows continued in the late afternoons and early evenings. A prime-time movie was also added along with some older shows late at night. The station was on-the-air about twenty hours a day by then. Its on-air branding at that time was \"Watch What We're Doing Now\".\n\nWDSI provided, free of charge, UHF antennas (which customers could obtain at local convenience stores) so viewers could watch the station. At that time, many households in the Chattanooga media market were still not wired for cable. After the overhaul in programming, the station was sold to Donatelli and Klein in 1985. Stronger, more recent sitcoms such as \"Benson\", \"M*A*S*H\", and better movies were added to the schedule and the religious shows were scaled back even more becoming relegated only to Sunday mornings. On October 9, 1986, WDSI became a charter affiliate of Fox beginning with \"The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers\", remaining with the network until October 2015. It was a typical Fox station at that time running a blend of newer cartoons, recent off network sitcoms, classic cartoons, old sitcoms, old movies, and drama shows. The station was becoming one of the strongest independents in Tennessee, the polar opposite of what it was just five years before.\n\nIn 1993, the station was sold to Pegasus Communications. As time went on due to changes in the industry, classic sitcoms and movies were gradually replaced by more modern talk/reality programs and court shows. Cartoons began to fall off the schedule from 1999 until 2002 and replaced by more first run reality programs. In 2002, WDSI began broadcasting a digital signal on UHF channel 40. On September 5, 2006, the station launched Fox's new sister network MyNetworkTV on a new second digital subchannel. It was not until March 2009 that WDSI-DT2 was added to area digital cable systems.\n\nPegasus sold most of its stations, including WDSI, to investment group CP Media, LLC on January 4, 2007; with the sale consummated on March 31. CP then formed New Age Media as the parent company for the former Pegasus stations.\n\nSinclair Broadcast Group purchased the non-license assets of WDSI-TV and WFLI-TV from New Age Media for $1.25 million in September 2015.\n\nDuring a transition process that was completed on October 31, 2015, WTVC's second digital channel simulcast WDSI. On that date, when Sinclair launched their new network Comet, the Fox schedule and the intellectual unit for WDSI's main signal moved permanently to WTVC-DT2 under the on-air moniker \"Fox Chattanooga.\" The programming on This TV which had been on WTVC-DT2 moved to WDSI's main signal, with Comet launching on WDSI-DT2; the MyNetworkTV subchannel was moved to WFLI-DT2, with the MeTV signal which had been carried on that slot moved to WFLI-DT3. Cable, satellite, and EPB viewers saw no change in any channel slots, as WTVC-DT2 took over the former channel slots for WDSI's main signal.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWDSI-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 61, on January 19, 2008. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 40. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 61, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition. WDSI moved to channel 14 on September 1, 2018.\n\nDuring the early-1990s, ABC affiliate WTVC produced Chattanooga's first nightly prime time newscast at 10 p.m. on then-Independent station WFLI through a news outsourcing arrangement. The show was eventually cancelled for an unknown reason. In 1996, WTVC established a second broadcast in prime time at 10 p.m. on WDSI through another news share agreement. This time around, the ABC affiliate provided its own meteorologists, sports anchors, and news reporters while WDSI featured its own news anchors based at its separate studios.\n\nAlthough the newscast was produced with assistance from WTVC, WDSI aired the local news segment from an expanded facility at its own studios. Eventually in 2000, the operation would be expanded into a full local news department competing with the area's big three outlets. WDSI launched its own news department with local news offered on weekday mornings, weekday afternoons at 4, and every night at 10. This would remain the case until 2004 when WDSI reduced its operations and re-established a news outsourcing arrangement with WTVC, which was maintained until Sinclair and WTVC obtained full ownership of the WDSI-DT1 schedule and intellectual unit in October 2015.\n\n"}

Florida, 379 U.S. 184 (1964), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court ruled unanimously that a cohabitation law of Florida, part of the state's anti-miscegenation laws, was unconstitutional. The law prohibited habitual cohabitation by two unmarried people of opposite sex, if one was black and the other was white. The decision overturned \"Pace v. Alabama\" (1883), which had declared such statutes constitutional. It did not overturn the related Florida statute that prohibited interracial marriage between whites and blacks. Such laws were declared unconstitutional in 1967 in \"Loving v. Virginia\".\n\nIn 1962, Dewey McLaughlin, a Miami Beach hotel porter originally from Honduras, and Connie Hoffman, a Caucasian waitress, were an unmarried couple living together in a Miami Beach apartment located at 732 2nd Street. Their landlady, Dora Goodnick, had rented the apartment only to Hoffman, and, when she found out about McLaughlin, she did not want the interracial unmarried couple living in the apartment. In an effort to get them out, Goodnick complained to the Miami Beach police that Hoffman's son was wandering the streets after midnight. Police investigated the matter, and, after the couple admitted that they were unmarried and lived together, they were charged in Florida state court with the crime of a black man and a white woman habitually living in and occupying in the nighttime the same room. A jury trial resulted in a verdict of guilt, a sentence of thirty days in the county jail, and a fine of $150 for each defendant.\n\nSection 798.05 of Florida statutes read: \"Any negro man and white woman, or any white man and negro woman, who are not married to each other, who shall habitually live in and occupy in the nighttime the same room shall each be punished by imprisonment not exceeding twelve months, or by fine not exceeding five hundred dollars.\"\n\nThis law was a part of the adultery and fornication laws of Florida. While all the other sections of this chapter required proof that sexual intercourse took place, Section 798.05 required only cohabitation. The law specifically prohibited a couple in which \"one is white and the other is black\". It did not apply to any other racial groups or combinations. It was part of Florida's anti-miscegenation laws prohibiting marriage, cohabitation, and extramarital sex between whites and blacks, and addressed only relationships between whites and non-whites. Similar anti-miscegenation laws were enforced in many states into the 1960s, and by all Southern states until 1967, when all remaining state bans on interracial marriage between whites and non-whites were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in \"Loving v. Virginia\".\n\nJustice White in his majority opinion held that the law, as it made a special case for couples of these two specific races, bore a \"heavier burden of justification\". Florida had not demonstrated any reason that made such a race-specific prohibition necessary.\n\nJustice Harlan, in his concurrence, emphasized the \"heavier burden\" requirement that White described and wrote that the law should pass a \"necessity test\", which is very stringent and applied to free speech cases.\n\nJustices Stewart and Douglas joined in an even stronger concurrence and denied even the \"possibility\" of an \"overriding statutory purpose\" that would justify such a law. Stewart wrote, \"We deal here with a criminal law which imposes criminal punishment. And I think it is simply not possible for a state law to be valid under our Constitution which makes the criminality of an act depend upon the race of the actor. Discrimination of that kind is invidious per se.\"\n\nThough the state claimed that Section 798.05 (prohibiting cohabitation) was ancillary to Section 741.11 (prohibiting intermarriage), the Court did not consider the latter statute, and it remained in force until \"Loving v. Virginia\" (1967).\n\n"}

He was influenced by G.E. Moore, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Sigmund Freud, and in turn explained and extended their work.\n\nWisdom was educated at Aldeburgh Lodge School, Suffolk, and Fitzwilliam House, Cambridge, where he graduated with a first-class BA degree in Moral Sciences in 1924. He is not to be confused with the philosopher John Oulton Wisdom (1908–1993), his cousin, who shared his interest in psychoanalysis.\n\nBefore the posthumous publication of Wittgenstein's \"Philosophical Investigations\" in 1953, Wisdom's writing was one of the few published sources of information about Wittgenstein's later philosophy.\n\nHis article \"Philosophical Perplexity\" has been described as ‘something of a landmark in the history of philosophy’ being ‘the first which throughout embodied the new philosophical outlook’.\n\nAccording to David Pole \"in some directions at least Wisdom carries Wittgenstein's work further than he himself did, and faces its consequences more explicitly.\"\n\nWisdom was for most of his career at Trinity College, Cambridge, and became Professor of Philosophy at Cambridge University. Near the end of his career he was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Oregon. He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1950 to 1951.\n\nHis famous \"Parable of the Invisible Gardener\" is a dialectic on the existence or absence of God.\n\nThe first recorded use of the term \"analytic philosophers\" occurred in Wisdom's 1931 work, \"Interpretation and Analysis in Relation to Bentham's Theory of Definition\", which expounded on Bentham's concept of \"paraphrasis\": \"that sort of exposition which may be afforded by transmuting into a proposition, having for its subject some real entity, a proposition which has not for its subject any other than a fictitious entity\". At first Wisdom referred to \"logic-analytic philosophers\", then to \"analytic philosophers\". According to Michael Beaney, \"the explicit articulation of the idea of paraphrasis in the work of both Wisdom in Cambridge and Ryle in Oxford represents a definite stage in the construction of analytic philosophy as a tradition\".\n\nHe was cremated and his ashes were buried at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge.\n\n\n"}

In his \"atelier\" large altar-pieces and other sacred paintings were executed, and also elaborate carved painted wood retables, consisting of crowded subjects in high relief, richly decorated with gold and colour.\n\nWolgemut was a leader among the artists reviving the standards of German woodcut at this time. The production of woodcuts was a large part of the work of the workshop, the blocks being cut from Wolgemut's designs. They were mostly made to supply the many publishers in Nuremberg with book illustrations, with the most attractive also being sold separately. Wolgemut's woodcuts followed the advances in engraving, depicting volume and shading to a much greater extent than before. Many are remarkable for their vigour and clever adaptation to the special necessities of the technique of woodcut. Nonetheless, they were very often hand-coloured before or after sale. His pupil Dürer was to build on and to so surpass his achievement that it is often overlooked.\n\nWolgemut's paintings show Flemish influence, and he may have traveled within Flanders (modern Belgium and surrounding areas).\n\nWolgemut trained with his father Valentin Wolgemut (who died in 1469 or 1470) and is thought to have been an assistant to Hans Pleydenwurff in Nuremberg. He worked with Gabriel Malesskircher in Munich early in 1471, leaving the city after unsuccessfully suing Malesskircher's daughter for breach of contract, claiming she had broken off their engagement. He then returned to his late father's workshop in Nuremberg, which his mother had maintained since Valentin's death.\n\nIn 1472 he married Pleydenwurff's widow and took over his workshop; her son Wilhelm Pleydenwurff worked as an assistant, and from 1491 a partner, to Wolgemut. Some consider Wilhelm a finer artist than Wolgemut, however he died in January 1494, when he was probably still in his thirties. Wilhelm's oeuvre remains unclear, though works in various media have been attributed to him.\n\nTwo large and copiously illustrated books have woodcuts supplied by Wolgemut and his stepson Wilhelm Pleydenwurff; both were printed and published by Germany's largest publisher, the Nuremberger Anton Koberger, who was also Dürer's godfather. The first is the \"Schatzbehalter der wahren Reichthumer des Heils\" (1491); the other is the \"Historia mundi\", by Schedel (1493), usually known as the \"Nuremberg Chronicle\", which is highly valued, not for the text, but for its remarkable collection of 1,809 spirited illustrations. Wolgemut and Wilhelm Pleydenwurff were first commissioned to provide the illustrations in 1487-1488, and a further contract of 29 December 1491 commissioned manuscript layouts of the text and illustrations. A further contact of 1492 stipulated that Koberger should provide a locked room for the blocks to be kept safely. A drawing by Wolgemut for the elaborate frontispiece, dated 1490, is in the British Museum. As with other books of the period, many of the woodcuts, showing towns, battles or kings were used more than once in the book, with the text labels merely changed. The book is large, with a double-page woodcut measuring about 342x500mm.\n\nThe earliest known work by Wolgemut is a retable consisting of four panels, dated 1465, now in the Munich gallery, a decorative work of much beauty. In 1479 he painted the retable of the high altar in the church of St Mary at Zwickau, which still exists, receiving for it the large sum of 1400 gulden. One of his finest and largest works is the great retable painted for the church of the Augustinian friars at Nuremberg, now moved into the museum; it consists of a great many panels, with figures of locally venerated saints.\n\nIn 1501 Wolgemut was employed to decorate the town hall at Goslar with a large series of paintings; some on the ceiling are on panel, and others on the walls are painted thinly in tempera on canvas. As a portrait-painter he enjoyed much repute, and some of his works of this class are very admirable for their realistic vigour and minute finish.\n\nOutside Germany Wolgemut's paintings are scarce: the Royal Institution at Liverpool possesses two good examples--\"Pilate washing his Hands\", and \"The Deposition from the Cross\", parts probably of a large altar-piece. During the last ten years of his life Wohlgemut appears to have produced little by his own hand. One of his latest paintings is the retable at Schwabach, executed in 1508, the contract for which still exists. He died at Nuremberg in 1519.\n"}

{"id": "2156837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156837", "title": "Colegio Cesar Chavez", "text": "Colegio Cesar Chavez\n\nColegio Cesar Chavez (Spanish for \"Cesar Chavez College\") was an American college-without-walls in Mount Angel, Oregon (the concept of college without walls is explained more below.) The college was named after Mexican American civil rights activist César Chávez. Colegio was established in 1973 and closed its doors in 1983. Colegio was the first accredited, independent four-year Chicano/Latino college in the United States. In 1975 it was granted candidacy status from the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges. In 1977, Colegio granted degrees to 22 graduates, a number exceeding the combined number of Chicanos who graduated that same year from University of Oregon and Oregon State University. In his book \"\", author Carlos Maldonado writes that Colegio Cesar Chavez was one of the few institutions that was named after Cesar Chavez during his lifetime.\n\nFor many members of the Colegio community, the most memorable campus event occurred on May 16, 1974, when Cesar Chavez paid his first visit to the college... More than 600 people, mostly Mexican Americans, crowded into Guadalupe Hall to see and hear Chavez... Chavez devoted most of his speech to the union’s fight with the growers, making his case for the boycott. But he also talked about Colegio, confessing that, if someone had told him five years earlier that Mexican Americans would have established their own college in Oregon, he ‘would have thought they were crazy.’ ‘Who knows?’ he added. ‘Maybe tomorrow there will be mariachi music in the White House.’ \n\nColegio Cesar Chavez evolved from various other collegial institutions that had existed in Mount Angel, Oregon for nearly a century. In 1888, the Catholic Order of the Benedictine Sisters founded Mt. Angel Academy. The Academy was originally a female charter academy but later evolved into a normal school in 1897 to train women for careers in education. In 1947, Mt. Angel Normal School was renamed Mt. Angel Women's College and, with accreditation from the Northwest Accrediting Association, it granted a Bachelor of Science degree in elementary education. In 1957, Mt. Angel Women's College became coeducational and was renamed Mt. Angel College.\n\nBy 1966 Mt. Angel College was facing financial problems for which it received two federal loans which it used to expand the campus. Within the next seven years, Mt. Angel College found itself burdened by a one million dollar debt and low student enrollment. In 1977, Ernesto Lopez became Dean of Students of Mt. Angel College and Sonny Montes became Director of Ethnic Affairs and minority recruiter. By 1972, Mt. Angel College had a student body of only 250, only 37 of whom were of Mexican American descent.\n\nCiting the Mt. Angel College's financial instability and low enrollment, the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges withdrew the college's accreditation. In light of such bleak signs, most students and staff left the college. Sonny Montes, Ernesto Lopez, and four others decided to attempt to salvage the college by redirecting its focus. On December 12, 1973, Mt. Angel College was renamed Colegio Cesar Chavez. In 1975, Colegio was granted accreditation candidacy from the same association that had withdrawn Mt. Angel College's accreditation. Colegio aimed to create a four-year college completely under the control of a staff chiefly of Mexican American, or Chicano, descent. Colegio was also structured on an experimental educational model known as a \"college without walls\" program.\n\nPrevious to settling on the name \"Colegio Cesar Chavez\", staff had considered three other names for the college: \"Colegio Che Guevara\", \"Colegio Ho Chi Minh\", and \"Colegio Virgen de Guadalupe\". César Chávez's name was chosen because he was one of the key figures in the Chicano movement, often organizing boycotts and protests for farm workers in California and eventually throughout the entire Pacific Northwest. The majority of Mexican Americans in the Pacific Northwest had migrated to the region during the World War II era in search of work as farm laborers.\nThe students were able to get Cesar Chavez's help in renegotiating the debt with HUD. The Chicano militants put together a staff and recruited students. Together, they were making ends meet and had gotten past the first steps toward full accreditation. As a volunteer, I helped them in obtaining a Dean's Grant for bilingual education. I also began an international education course of study with Mexico at the Colegio.|Jose Angel Gutierrez \n\nColegio Cesar Chavez operated under the \"El Colegio Sin Paredes\" (\"The College Without Walls\") model. This model granted students the ability to actively engage with their community, to maintain control of their own education, and to combine their classroom studies with experience outside of the classroom.\n\nThe College Without Walls Program had been established by the Union for Experimenting Colleges and Universities. This format allowed for the inclusion of a wide range of age groups, encouraged the participation and collaboration of students, staff, and administrators in creating and implementing the curriculum. Alternative means of evaluation was also encouraged. In this program, instructors were redefined as facilitators in the learning process. Additionally, Colegio staff, administration, and students relations were structured in accordance to a framework that Colegio termed \"La Familia,\" meaning \"The Family\". To that end, the \"family\" members were encouraged to participate in the decisions affecting the college. Such a framework inevitably required for students to be self-motivated and to initiate and pursue an independent course of education.\nColegio's core educational foundation consisted of work in four areas: Social Science (Anthropology, Economics, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology); the Humanities (Literature, History, Arts, Philosophy, Language); Natural Sciences and Mathematics; oral and written bilingual Communications. Each student was required to complete fifteen credit hours in each area, totaling 60 credit hours. Credit transfers from parallel areas was allowed. Students could also receive credit for prior learning.\n\nFrom its inception, the leadership of Colegio Cesar Chavez was in a constant state of flux. In its brief ten years, Colegio was served by four administrations. Each administration faced substantial institutional crises. In 1973, Ernesto Lopez, former Academic Dean and Acting President of Mt. Angel College, became Colegio's first President. Lopez retained this position for only one year. After the departure of Lopez, the position of administrative head was altered into a co-directorship. Sonny Montes was named Director of Administration. Jose Romero was named Director of Academics. The split into two co-directors was made in an attempt to relieve the overwhelming duties that Lopez had faced.\n\nSonny Montes did not possess an advanced degree, as had Lopez, and he had far less experience working in higher education than had Lopez. Montez' organizing abilities and many contacts within the Chicano Movement were compensations. It was during the joint Montes-Romero administration that Colegio Cesar Chavez received accreditation candidacy on June 18, 1975, from the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges. Sonny Montes retired as Colegio administrator in October 1977, citing personal and economic concerns. He was extended an invitation to serve on Colegio's board, which he accepted.\nSalvador Ramirez followed Sonny Montes, becoming Colegio's top administrator in 1977. Ramirez, who held a master's degree in history, had served Colegio as history teacher since mid-1976. His previous work experience included employment with University of Colorado at Boulder and Washington State University. During Ramirez' tenure, Colegio finalized its negotiations with HUD. Ramirez resigned from his position at Colegio in 1979.\n\nIrma Flores Gonzales , previously a member of both Colegio's board and staff, became president of Colegio in 1979. Gonzales held a B.A. in education and a M.A. in psychology. It was during Gonzales' time as president that Colegio faced its greatest challenges: difficulty in developing and maintaining a financial base; preparing Colegio for accreditation by June 1981; and expanding college enrollment. During Gonzales' time as president, Colegio staff succumbed to infighting. By this point, many activists within the Chicano Movement had become disillusioned with Colegio. Gonzales was Colegio's last president.\n\nOne of the larger paintings at the colegio depicts a seemingly endless abundantly fertile field. As with so many of the murals, the sun is a significant component; here, it plays just beyond the horizon, with the overall warmth and seductiveness of the image suggesting the promise of an imminent sunrise rather than a sunset. The scene is viewed through a golden portal set on a patio in the foreground and may represent, as PSU’s (Tony) Cabello suggests, the opportunity that is possible for the immigrant to el norte. The painting abuts another portal – the main entrance to the colegio building – providing an ironic contrast to the short-lived promise of opportunity embodied in the colegio’s operation.\n\nColegio Cesar Chavez's main campus building was the two-story administrative building called Huelga Hall. (\"Huelga\" [pronounced \"welga\"] is Spanish for \"strike\".) When it was a part of Mount Angel College, Huelga Hall was known as Marmion Hall and was used as the campus dormitory for women. Huelga Hall was the hub of campus activity and was where most classes were held. The walls of Huelga Hall were covered with large Mexican-themed murals, some in the style of Diego Rivera, others being transcriptions of ancient Aztec artwork. In the main reception room there was a mural of Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara near the fireplace. To the north of Huelga Hall stood two buildings that served as dormitories for Colegio students.\n\nColegio also owned two homes. Directly behind Huelga Hall was the Art Building. The Art Building was a two-story farm house in the Victorian style. It had been built in the mid-1900s by the Bernt family of Mt. Angel. When Mount Angel College took possession of the Bernt house, it was renamed Studio San Benito. Under Colegio's ownership, the house was referred to as the Art Building. The Art Building lay vacant and unused for most of Colegio's existence until when in 1980 it was occupied by the family of Arthur Omar Olivo. Mr. Olivo was the grounds keeper and facilities maintenance manager of Colegio César Chávez. After a falling out with Colegio president Irma Gonzales, the Olivo family vacated the Art Building in 1982 shortly before Colegio's closure. Beside the Art House stood another two-story house that was referred to as the Pottery Building. Both the Pottery Building and the Art Building were demolished in the mid-1980s.\n\nOn the other side of Main Street, across from Huelga Hall, Colegio maintained Guadalupe Hall, a building named in honor of Our Lady of Guadalupe.\n\nAfter the closure of Colegio Cesar Chavez, the facilities and grounds were left unused and abandoned for several years. Eventually, a private benefactor purchased the former Colegio grounds and facilities and donated it back to its pre-Colegio owners, the Benedictine Sisters of Mt. Angel. Today, the former Colegio grounds and facilities are used as St. Joseph Shelter. Shortly after reclaiming ownership of the former Colegio building, the Benedictine Sisters had all but one Colegio-era mural painted over. The one remaining mural is titled \"College Without Walls\" and was created by Daniel Desiga. The mural depicts an arch entry overlooking a vast strawberry field. The arch has been interpreted as representing the college without walls program of Colegio, and the vast strawberry field in the background is likely a reference to the field workers and the fact that many Colegio teachers and students had either worked in the fields or were from families who had survived by means of field work.\n\nIn his book \"\", to date the only full-length book about Colegio, author Carlos Maldonado writes that Colegio was often referred to as \"the longest running death in history\", and that study of Colegio Cesar Chavez will \"help promoters of new ethnic institutions to raise questions of feasibility, anticipate problems, and provide direction in the establishment of new and more sophisticated institutions.\" Maldonado claims that Colegio's staff was small and relatively inexperienced and therefore unprepared for the challenges of starting a new college. Eventually the staff succumbed to infighting. Maldonado also claims that it was difficult to foster an on-campus sense of community among staff and students because Colegio was a college-without-walls program. The author notes that Colegio was founded during a time of downturn in activism in the Chicano Movement. Colegio was founded during a period of growing political conservatism marked by less federal support for cultural programs. Colegio was founded in a small rural town whose population largely disliked Colegio's predecessor of Mount Angel College and therefore saw Colegio as an extension of Mount Angel College. The surrounding community was relatively prejudiced against Mexican Americans. Lastly, Colegio was named in honor of a man many local farm owners found controversial. \nOn its website the Oregon Historical Society writes, \"Structured as a 'college-without-walls,' more than 100 students took classes in Chicano Studies, early childhood development, and adult education. Significant financial and administrative problems caused Colegio to close in 1983. Its history represents the success of a grassroots movement.\" \n\nCesar Chavez's United Farmworkers union is not present in the state of Oregon. Instead, the main union for farm workers in the state of Oregon is Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste. The meetings which led to the formation of PCUN were held at Colegio Cesar Chavez. PCUN's founder, the late Cipriano Ferrel, attended Colegio Cesar Chavez.\n\nIn 2009, Oregon Public Broadcasting published an article titled \"What is Cesar Chavez's Connection to Oregon?\" The article centers on the controversial public debate at the time regarding whether a Portland street should be named in honor of Cesar Chavez. Those opposed to honoring Chavez with a Portland street had occasionally argued that the activist had no presence in the state. The article contains an interview with a man who assisted Chavez during a public address he made at the state Capitol in Salem, Oregon. The article concludes with an interview with Joseph Gallegos, an early faculty member of Colegio Cesar Chavez who claims that during the 1970s and 1980s \"the Colegio was a critical symbol of our presence, the Latino presence here in the state, and also I think trying to bring attention to the problem the Colegio was trying to address, that Latinos were not getting through the four-year institutions.\" \n\nVictor Paredes wrote that Cesar Chavez cared deeply about education, and that \"Thus the greatest honor he may have received during his lifetime was the opening of the Colegio Cesar Chavez in Oregon.\" \n\n\nOregon State University maintains and displays the Colegio Cesar Chavez Collection. The collection consists of documents and photographs pertaining to the life and work of Arthur Omar Olivo. Mr. Olivo had been born in a migrant camp in Texas to parents from Mexico. Later, the family would move to San Jose, California where Mr. Olivo would work for an organization called Center for Employment Training, a job training program whose students are mostly Latino and which was funded in part by the Cesar Chavez's United Farm Workers union. It was during this period, in the 1960s and 1970s, that Mr. Olivo came to be friends with Cesar Chavez. In the late 1970s, Mr. Olivo moved his family to the state of Oregon in order to found an Oregon branch of Center for Employment Training. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Mr. Olivo was involved with Colegio Cesar Chavez as both a student and as facilities manager, and he and his family also lived on the college grounds in Mount Angel, Oregon. Items from the Colegio Cesar Chavez collection are available for individual research and are occasionally on display at OSU events regarding the Multicultural Archives.\n\nFour candids of a poetry reading by Chicano poet Alurista at Colegio César Chávez, circa 1981.

Daniel Crosby Greene. He was also the brother of diplomat Roger Sherman Greene II, the nephew of famed historian Evarts Boutell Greene, and his grandmother was the sister of former US Senator, US Secretary of State, and US Attorney General William William Maxwell Evarts. The great-nephew of US Senator George Frisbie Hoar, US Senator and Connecticut Governor Roger Sherman Baldwin, US Attorney General and Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar, as well as the nephew of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Washington Territory, Justice Roger Sherman Greene.\n\nGreene graduated from Harvard College by 1897 and became secretary to Harvard University's president and the Harvard Corporation from 1901-1910. This gave him contacts with Wall Street which made him general manager of the Rockefeller Institute from 1910-1912. Later, Greene became an assistant to John D. Rockefeller in philanthropic work for two years, then trustee to the Rockefeller Institute, to the Rockefeller Foundation, and finally to the Rockefeller General Education Board until 1939.\n\nFor fifteen years (1917-1932) he worked for the Boston investment banking firm of Lee, Higginson & Co; most of those years serving as its chief executive officer, as well as with its London branch. He was executive secretary of the American section of the Allied Maritime Transport Council stationed in London, England 1918. He lived in Toynbee Hall, the world's first settlement house. This brought him in contact with the Round Table Group in England, a contact which was strengthened in 1919 when he became secretary to the Reparations Commission at the Paris Peace Conference. Accordingly, on his return to the United States he was one of the early figures in the establishment of the Council on Foreign Relations which served as the New York branch of the Lionel Curtis Institute of International Affairs.\n\nAs an investment banker, Greene is mainly remembered for his sales of millions of dollars of the fraudulent securities of the Swedish match king, Ivar Kreuger. That Greene offered these to the American investing public in good faith is evident from the fact that he put a substantial part of his own fortune in the same investments. As a consequence, Kreuger's suicide in Paris in April 1932 left Greene with little money and no job. He wrote to Lionel Curtis asking for help and was given, for two years, a professorship in international relations at Aberystwyth, Wales. The Round Table Group controlled the professorship from its founding by David Davies 1919, though Davies had broken with the Round Table because of its subversion of the League of Nations and European collective security.\n\nOn his return to America in 1934, Greene also returned to his secretaryship of the Harvard Corporation and became, for the remainder of his life, a trustee and officer of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Gardner Museum in Fenway Court, the New England Conservatory of Music, the American Academy in Rome, the Brookings Institution, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the General Education Board (only until 1939). He was also the director of the Harvard University's year-long 1936 wikt:Tercentenary Celebration.\n\nGreene is of much greater significance in indicating the real influences within the Institute of Pacific Relations than any Communists or fellow travelers. He wrote the constitution for the IPR in 1916. For years he was the chief conduit for Wall Street funds and influence into the organization. Additionally, Greene was treasurer of the American Council for three years and chairman for three more, as well as chairman of the International Council for four years.\n\nHe became involved with the Round Table Groups, which were semi-secret discussion and lobbying groups organized by Lionel Curtis, Philip Henry Kerr (Lord Lothian), and (Sir) William S. Marris in 1908-1911. This was done on behalf of Lord Milner, the dominant Trustee of the Rhodes Trust in the two decades 1905-1925. The original purpose of these groups was to seek to federate the English-speaking world along lines laid down by Cecil Rhodes (1853-1902) and William T. Stead (1849-1912), and the money for the organizational work came originally from the Rhodes Trust. By 1915 Round Table groups existed in seven countries, including England, South Africa, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and a rather loosely organized group in the United States (George Louis Beer, Walter Lippmann, Frank Aydelotte, Whitney Shepardson, Thomas W. Lamont, Erwin D. Canham of the Christian Science Monitor, and others). The attitudes of the various groups were coordinated by frequent visits and discussions and by a well-informed and totally anonymous quarterly magazine, The Round Table Journal, whose first issue, largely written by Philip Kerr, appeared in November 1910.\n\nThe leaders of this group were: Milner, until his death in 1925, followed by Curtis (1872-1955), Robert H, (Lord) Brand \" (brother -in-law of Lady Astor)\" until his death in 1963, and now Adam D. Marris, son of Sir William and Brand's successor as managing director of Lazard Frères bank. The original intention had been to have collegial leadership, but Milner was too secretive and headstrong to share the role. He did so only in the period 1913-1919 when he held regular meetings with some of his closest friends to coordinate their activities as a pressure group in the struggle with Wilhelmine Germany. This they called their \"\"Ginger Group.\"\" After Milner's death in 1925, the leadership was largely shared by the survivors of Milner's \"\"Kindergarten,\"\" that is, the group of young Oxford men whom he used as civil servants in his reconstruction of South Africa in 1901-1910. Brand was the last survivor of the \"\"Kindergarten\"\"; since his death, the greatly reduced activities of the organization have been exercised largely through the Editorial Committee of The Round Table magazine under Adam Marris.\n\nMoney for the widely ramified activities of this organization came originally from the associates and followers of Cecil Rhodes, chiefly from the Rhodes Trust itself, and from wealthy associates such as the Beit brothers, from Sir Abe Bailey, and \"(after 1915)\" from the Astor family. Since 1925 there have been substantial contributions from wealthy individuals and from foundations and firms associated with the international banking fraternity, especially the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust and other organizations associated with J. P. Morgan, the Rockefeller and Whitney families, and the associates of Lazard Frères and of Morgan, Grenfell & Company.\n\nJerome Davis Greene was a partner in Lee, Higginson & Co., Secretary to the Corporation, Harvard University, 1905-1910 & 1934-1943; Joint Secretary of the Reparations Committee at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919; Secretary and Trustee, the Rockefeller Foundation, 1913-17 & 1928-1939; Chairman, Council Institute of Pacific Relations, (1929–32); a Trustee, the Brookings Institution of Washington D.C., 1928-1945.\n\n"}

She sang in her parents' church as a child, and in high school she performed at school shows and family gatherings.\n\nIn 1976, while attending West Virginia University, she joined a bluegrass band, and two years later dropped out of school to move to Nashville. During this time, Mattea also listened to folk and bluegrass, which she would later say \"formed [her] roots\" as an artist. She worked as a tour guide at the Country Music Hall of Fame, and then as a secretary and a waitress, in order to support herself while working as a demo singer. Songwriter, publisher, and record producer Byron Hill discovered her and helped her sign to Mercury Records in 1983.\n\nMattea's self-titled debut came out in 1984, with Hill and Rick Peoples as the album's producers. Mattea later noted that \"there were no budgets\" when she was recording the album, as she was unable to afford a $75 makeup session, and the front cover featured her wearing a jacket which she had purchased at Kmart. Even so, four of its singles made the Hot Country Songs charts, starting with \"Street Talk\", which charted at No. 25. Mattea had originally recorded a demo of the song with the intent of having Terri Gibbs record it, but Mattea kept it for herself when Gibbs declined the song. Followup \"Someone Is Falling in Love\" (written by Pebe Sebert) made it to No. 26 on the same chart, while \"You've Got a Soft Place to Fall\" and \"That's Easy for You to Say\" fell short of the top 40. Other notable cuts on the album included \"God Ain't No Stained Glass Window\", which was released as a 12\" promotional single for the Christmas season; a cover version of Barry Manilow's 1981 hit \"Somewhere Down the Road\"; and \"(Back to the) Heartbreak Kid\", which later became a Top 10 hit on the country charts for Restless Heart in late 1985 to early 1986. Allmusic reviewer William Ruhlmann wrote of the album that it was \"a fairly representative sampling of Nashville formula country writing\", while praising the \"feisty\" nature of \"Street Talk\" and Mattea's vocals on \"Heartbreak Kid\". \"People\" reviewer Ralph Novak compared Mattea's voice favorably to Anne Murray and said that \"Mattea may not have the most revolutionary sound around, but her material is especially good.\"\n\nHer second album, \"From My Heart\", was also her first under the production of Allen Reynolds, who is best known for his work with Crystal Gayle and Garth Brooks. Released in 1985, it produced the chart singles \"It's Your Reputation Talkin'\", \"He Won't Give In\", and \"Heart of the Country\", which peaked at numbers 34, 22, and 46 respectively on Hot Country Songs. It also featured a cover of Elton John's \"Ball and Chain\", from his 1982 album \"Jump Up!\" Ruhlmann found this album superior to its predecessor, stating that Reynolds \"seems to have shaped the song selections to the singer's talents and given her the opportunity to sing in a more individual manner.\" A review of the album in \"Billboard\" was also positive, noting the \"more focused direction and a simpler, purer sound\".\n\n1986's \"Walk the Way the Wind Blows\" was, according to Allmusic, \"her breakthrough both critically and commercially\". Four singles were released from the album. First was \"Love at the Five and Dime\", written and originally recorded by Nanci Griffith on her 1986 album \"The Last of the True Believers\". Following it were \"Walk the Way the Wind Blows\", \"You're the Power\", and \"Train of Memories\". All four of these songs reached the top 10 of the country music charts between 1986 and 1987. The B-side to \"You're the Power\" was a rendition of \"Song for the Life\", written by Rodney Crowell and later a top 10 hit for Alan Jackson in 1995. Contributing musicians on \"Walk the Way the Wind Blows\" included Béla Fleck, Don Williams (who sang background vocals on \"Love at the Five and Dime\"), Wendy Waldman, and Vince Gill. \"Billboard\" praised \"Walk the Way the Wind Blows\" as \"Mattea's most country effort to date\". An uncredited review in \"Stereo Review\" (now \"Sound & Vision\") stated that \"if every country album were as tasteful and well executed as \"Walk the Way the Wind Blows\"...the reviewer's life would be a happy one indeed\", while rating the performance and recording as \"perfection\". Thom Jurek felt that the album's uptempo cuts were stronger than its ballads, noting that \"Her ballad singing hadn't gotten to the place it did just three years later\" while praising her performances on the more upbeat tracks and on \"Love at the Five and Dime\".\n\nMattea had her first No. 1 single in late 1987 to early 1988 with \"Goin' Gone\". Co-written by Pat Alger and Fred Koller, this song also previously appeared on \"The Last of the True Believers\". Mattea's version was the lead single to her fourth album \"Untasted Honey\". Following it was \"Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses\", which became her longest-tenured No. 1 single when it spent two weeks in that position. \"Untold Stories\" and \"Life as We Knew It\" were also released from the album, with both reaching the No. 4 position of the country charts. The album also featured bluegrass musician Tim O'Brien, who wrote both \"Walk the Way the Wind Blows\" and \"Untold Stories\", as a duet partner on the track \"The Battle Hymn of Love\". Jurek noted the album's bluegrass influences with favor, while comparing \"Untold Stories\" to the work of Bill Monroe and praising the lyrics of \"Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses\". \"People\" magazine's review of the album stated that \"it’s just Mattea, sounding warm, strong, smart and generally splendid,\" also commending the lyrical storytelling of \"Life as We Knew It\" and \"Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses\".\n\nIn 1989, she released \"Willow in the Wind\". This album's first two singles, \"Come from the Heart\" (previously recorded by Don Williams on his 1987 album \"Traces\") and \"Burnin' Old Memories\", also topped the country charts. After it came the top-ten Hot Country Songs hits \"Where've You Been\" (co-written by Mattea's husband, Jon Vezner) and \"She Came from Fort Worth\", the latter of which was a No. 1 single on the \"Radio & Records\" and \"Gavin Report\" country music charts. This album featured backing vocals from Craig Bickhardt, Riders in the Sky, Jim Photoglo, and Claire Lynch, with musical contributions from Mark O'Connor, Charlie McCoy, Jerry Douglas, and Ray Flacke. Jurek called it \"the first completely realized project of her career\", and highlighted Laurie Lewis's \"Love Chooses You\" as its strongest cut. An uncredited review from \"People\" was positive, stating that \"she’s still not one to rock and roll, but this album has a fair share of swingy, blue-newgrass tracks\", and that \"Mattea sounds warm and relaxed\". Comparing Mattea's vocals to Linda Ronstadt and Jennifer Warnes, Randy Lewis of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that \"she treats the songs, most of which are about lives in transition, with the requisite humility and honesty so their simple charms are not inflated into stentorian Author's Messages\". Mattea won the Country Music Association's Female Vocalist of the Year award in both 1989 and 1990, and a Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance in 1990 for \"Where've You Been\".\n\nLater in 1990, Mattea released her first greatest hits album, \"A Collection of Hits\". The album included eight of her previous singles, plus \"The Battle Hymn of Love\" from \"Untasted Honey\" and the new recording \"A Few Good Things Remain\". Both were released as singles in 1990 and reached the Top 10 of Hot Country Songs, with \"The Battle Hymn of Love\" representing O'Brien's only chart entry to date. \"A Few Good Things Remain\" was also featured on her next studio album, 1991's \"Time Passes By\". This project produced three singles: the title track reached Top 10, but \"Whole Lotta Holes\" and \"Asking Us to Dance\" were less successful. The album included Celtic music influences and was partially recorded in Scotland. Reynolds continued to serve as producer for this album except for the closing track, a cover of \"From a Distance\", which Mattea and Vezner produced with Dougie MacLean. Contributors on backing vocals included Trisha Yearwood (on \"Time Passes By\"), The Roches (on \"Whole Lotta Holes\"), Emmylou Harris, Craig Bickhardt, and Ashley Cleveland. Rating it \"A\", Alanna Nash of \"Entertainment Weekly\" called the album \"a quiet, reflective acoustic collection.\" Brian Mansfield noted in Allmusic that it was \"her most ambitious album\" and had \"impeccably chosen songs\".\n\n1992's \"Lonesome Standard Time\" produced a No. 11 country hit in its title track, plus the Top 20 \"Standing Knee Deep in a River (Dying of Thirst)\", but followups \"Seeds\" and \"Listen to the Radio\" became her first singles since 1985 not to enter the country Top 40. This was also her first album to be produced by Brent Maher, best known for his work with The Judds. Nash rated it \"B\", saying that \"not even the driving bluegrass of the title tune is enough to transcend the album’s ultrareflective mood. Mattea’s husky mezzo-soprano remains a thrilling instrument, however\". \"CD Review\" noted that the album seemed \"familiar\" despite the change in producers and session musicians: \"a couple of whimsical numbers, a couple of bluesy laments for love gone wrong, a let's-get-away-from-it-all love song\" while praising the lyrical content of \"Standing Knee Deep in a River\" and \"Seeds\". In June 1992, Mattea was required to undergo vocal rest and surgery due to \"repair years of overuse\" on her vocal cords. After recovering, she issued her first Christmas album, \"Good News\", in September 1993. It featured largely original compositions, plus renditions of the hymn \"Brightest and Best\" and the contemporary Christian tune \"Mary, Did You Know?\" Thom Jurek wrote of its sound, \"This doesn't feel like any Christmas record you've ever heard before...It sounds like a well-crafted, gorgeously wrought folk/country/Celtic-flavored Kathy Mattea record.\" This album won that year's Grammy Award for Best Southern, Country or Bluegrass Gospel Album. Maher again served as producer, with further production from Reynolds on one track.\n\nMattea released \"Walking Away a Winner\" in 1994. Produced by Josh Leo, the album was more rock and pop influenced than its predecessors, with Thom Jurek of Allmusic comparing its sound to Mary Chapin Carpenter and Bonnie Raitt. Nash noted the \"bigger\" sound of the album, but praised its \"style and substance\". The title track charted at No. 3 on the country charts in 1994, representing her last Top 10 hit; following it were \"Nobody's Gonna Rain on Our Parade\", \"Maybe She's Human\", and \"Clown in Your Rodeo\". The album featured backing vocals from Lisa Angelle, Karla Bonoff, Andrew Gold, and Hal Ketchum. Also in 1994, Mattea had a cameo in the movie \"Maverick\", whose soundtrack also featured her as one of several lead vocalists on a multi-artist rendition of \"Amazing Grace\".\n\nMattea spent the entirety of 1996 off the charts before returning with \"Love Travels\" in 1997. Its lead single was \"455 Rocket\", which charted at No. 21, followed by the title track at No. 39. Mattea noted that in the process of recording \"455 Rocket,\" the band recorded multiple takes but chose to keep the first one because \"no one thought they were being recorded, and everyone was just playing with abandon.\" Musicians on this album included bassist Hutch Hutchinson, drummers Abe Laboriel Jr. and Jim Keltner, and guitarist Duke Levine; contributing backing vocalists included Kim Richey, Michael McDonald, Suzy Bogguss, Jonatha Brooke, and Mary Ann Kennedy. Lionel Cartwright wrote \"If That's What You Call Love\", which also featured him on piano and background vocals, and Phil Keaggy played guitar on the closing track \"Beautiful Fool\". Thom Owens of Allmusic stated that \"though the glossy production may put off some of her old country-folk fans, \"Love Travels\" is a typically tasteful and compelling record\". Bob Cannon of \"Entertainment Weekly\" praised the inclusion of Gillian Welch and Cheryl Wheeler songs, calling it \"her most mature and focused work yet.\"\n\nHer last Mercury album was \"The Innocent Years\" in 2000. Before the album's release, Mattea returned to West Virginia to care for her father, who had been diagnosed with colon cancer. She said that this resulted in a very intermittent recording process, but also informed the album's content; she told \"Country Standard Time\", \"I spent a lot of time thinking about what's important to me. I think this is an album about those things.\" Although Mattea rarely writes her material, she wrote two songs on the album with Vezner. The album's final track, a novelty song called \"BFD\", was included as a bonus track because it was popular with fans, but she was unsure of how to sequence it with the rest of the album. \"The Trouble with Angels\" and \"BFD\" made the Hot Country Songs charts in 2000, although neither made Top 40. \"Country Standard Time\" reviewer Eli Messinger wrote that \"though the smooth sound and heart-on-her-sleeve lyrics may not be for the country roots fan...Mattea's superb voice and mature readings are clearly the work of an accomplished artist chasing her musical muse.\"\n\nFor 2002's \"Roses\", Mattea moved to Narada Productions. She said that she chose to work with this label after leaving Mercury because she felt that the label would \"give [her] alternative marketing ideas\" and \"didn't see [her] musical restlessness as a liability\". She said that she wanted to keep a contemporary folk and Celtic influence. Mattea supported the album with a tour largely focused on performing arts centers. Narada serviced \"They Are the Roses\" to Adult Contemporary and country stations, and \"I'm Alright\" to Adult album alternative and Americana music formats. Maria Konicki Dinoia wrote in Allmusic that \"she pushes the envelope, bringing to the forefront the blending of the Scottish/Irish music found in small doses on her last few albums.\" One year later, she released her second Christmas disc, \"Joy for Christmas Day\", which continued in her Celtic music influences. This album was inspired by her annual Christmas tours that she had done ever since the release of \"Good News\".\n\nHer third overall album for Narada was 2005's \"Right Out of Nowhere\". Produced entirely by Mattea, the album included covers of The Rolling Stones' \"Gimme Shelter\" and Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Down on the Corner\", along with a rendition of the spiritual \"Wade in the Water\". Allmusic and \"Country Standard Time\" both reviewed these covers in particular with favor, with the latter's Dan MacIntosh also noting that \"Mattea chooses songs that are mostly optimistic, even though hers is a kind of hard-won optimism.\"\n\nThe bluegrass album \"Coal\" followed in 2008. Mattea released this album independently on her own Captain Potato Records. Mattea said that she chose to do an album themed to coal mining after the Sago Mine disaster, and worked with country and bluegrass singer Marty Stuart as her producer. She said that she was unsure about recording the song \"Black Lung\" until Stuart noted that the recording engineer on the session had gotten emotional and begun to cry during her take on the song. A second album of bluegrass-influenced and primiarly coal mining-themed songs, \"Calling Me Home\", followed in 2014 on Sugar Hill Records.\n\nIn 2018, Mattea announced a new album, \"Pretty Bird\", which was released independently with Tim O'Brien serving as producer. The album's first single is a cover of Martha Carson's \"I Can't Stand Up Alone\", recorded as a tribute to Jesse Winchester. Also included on the album are covers of The Wood Brothers' \"Chocolate on My Tongue\", Bobbie Gentry's \"Ode to Billie Joe\", and Joan Osborne's \"St. Teresa\", the last of which is the album's second single.\n\nMattea participated in several collaborative works, primarily in the 1990s. In March 1991, Mattea was one of several artists on \"Voices That Care\", a charity single to help boost the morale of U.S. troops involved in Operation Desert Storm. Dolly Parton's 1993 single \"Romeo\" featured guest vocals from Mattea, Tanya Tucker, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Pam Tillis, and Billy Ray Cyrus. Mattea appeared on two tracks from the 1994 \"Red Hot + Country\" compilation, put out by the AIDS activism group Red Hot Organization. The first of these was a cover of \"Teach Your Children\" which also featured Suzy Bogguss, Alison Krauss, and Crosby, Stills & Nash, and the second was a duet with Jackson Browne titled \"Rock Me on the Water\". The former, credited to \"The Red Hots\", charted at No. 75 on Hot Country Songs dated for October 22, 1994. Also in 1994, Mattea sang duet vocals on Johnny Hallyday's \"Love Affair\", which made No. 35 on the French Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP) charts. In 1998, Mattea recorded a duet with Michael McDonald titled \"Among the Missing\", a charity single to help benefit the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC). It was written by Peter McCann and produced by George Massenburg, and a video of the performance was also issued on DVD. The song charted for a single week at No. 73 on Hot Country Songs dated for March 27, 1999.\n\nMattea has been married to songwriter Jon Vezner since February 14, 1988. He started a publishing company underneath the apartment in which Mattea lived in the 1980s, and the two met after he jump-started her car. Vezner wrote four of Mattea's singles: \"Where've You Been\", \"Whole Lotta Holes\", \"Time Passes By\", and \"A Few Good Things Remain\", along with singles by Diamond Rio and Clay Walker.\n\nMattea is known for her roles in AIDS activism. In 1992, many televised awards shows were handing out red ribbons to participants in honor of AIDS awareness, but the Country Music Association chose to hand out green ribbons promoting environmental awareness instead. Mattea chose to wear three red ribbons that night, each one honoring a friend of hers who had died of the disease, along with the green ribbon. A 1994 article in the \"Chicago Tribune\" noted that a Nashville newspaper interpreted a comment she had made on wearing both color ribbons as a confrontation, and that Mattea was often questioned as to whether her activism had a negative impact on sales of her then-current album. Besides her participation in the \"Red Hot + Country\" charity album series, Mattea also participated in charity concerts and made public appearances at activism campaigns. She was also the recipient of the inaugural Harvard AIDS Initiative award in 1994.\nFive of Mattea's albums are certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of 500,000 copies each, while her 1990 greatest hits album \"A Collection of Hits\" is certified platinum for sales of 1,000,000 copies.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The film follows Mansoor and Sarmad (played by Shaan and Khan), two singers whose lives change after the events of 9/11 attacks in America and misinterpreted teachings of Jihad.\n\n\"Khuda Kay Liye\" was released on 20 July 2007 in Pakistan and on 4 April 2008 in India, as well as the screenings at various international film festivals. The film subsequently won a number of awards for its acting, notably three Lux Style Awards, one Silver Pyramid Award at Cairo International Film Festival, one Roberto Rossellini Award, Italy and one Fukuoka Audience Award at Fukuoka International Film Festival, Japan. The release of the film was historic for two reasons: it was the first Pakistani film to be released in India in almost half a century, and secondly it was the first ever Pakistani film to be included in the official selection of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI).\n\nBrothers Mansoor and Sarmad are two successful singers from Lahore. Sarmad eventually is influenced by an Islamic activist Maulana Tahiri, as he begins to practice a more conservative Islamic way of living and gives up his music career as it is considered \"\"haram\"\" by the Islamic activist. Maryam (Mary), a westernised British Pakistani girl, falls in love with Dave from the British community. However this displeases her father, who is hypocritical, despite himself being in a live-in relationship with a British woman.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary's father plans to take her for a trip to Pakistan to meet Sarmad and Mansoor. While touring FATA, she gets deceived by her father to marry her cousin, Sarmad. Mary is forcefully married off to him and abandoned in their household. In an escape attempt, Mary tries to run from the village but gets caught by Sarmad. He eventually consummates their marriage by force as a sort of punishment so that Mary would not escape again.\n\nMansoor goes to a musical school in Chicago, where he meets fellow music student Janie. They fall in love with each other and Janie stops drinking alcohol for him. They eventually marry. However, shortly after the events of 9/11, Mansoor gets arrested by the FBI due to his Islamic background and is detained and tortured for a year in Guantanamo Bay detention camp.\n\nMary is rescued by Sarmad's father under the protection of the British government. A devastated Mary takes her father and cousin to court in Pakistan for justice. Wali (Naseeruddin Shah), a Maulana, then explains to the court how Islam is being misused in the name of war and hatred, bringing the religion forward in a believable and peaceful manner. Traumatised by all the suffering he has seen and caused, Sarmad withdraws the case. He also realizes the damage that he was made to inflict in the name of religion. Mary is now free and returns to the village where she was kept prisoner so she can educate the girls there. Meanwhile, Mansoor is still in FBI custody after a year of torment; the last torture session having inflicted permanent brain damage. After a failed rehab attempt, he is deported and reunited with his family in Pakistan where he begins to recover.\n\n\nShoaib Mansoor, the director of the film, developed the idea after the misconceptions about Pakistan in Pakistani diaspora and India. Mansoor stated that the film will clear the irrelevant thinking of Indians towards the Pakistani community.\n\nPrincipal photography of the film took place in Lahore, where most of the parts were filmed. Besides, the film was also shot at Chicago, London and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\n\"Khuda Kay Liye\" is one of Pakistan's highest-grossing films, with a domestic gross of $1.1 million and a worldwide gross of $2.1 million.\n\nThe music of the film was released on July 7, 2007. The soundtrack album of the film was composed and produced by Rohail Hyatt. All songs were written by Shoaib Mansoor with an exception of \"Mahi Way\" and \"Bandeya\".\n\n\n"}

Haswell-Smith refers to \"three prehistoric stone circles\" and a \"prehistoric stone circle ... beside the burn\" that had been dug up and placed there by the naturalist John Harvie Brown.\n\nHarvie Brown visited the island on July 4, 1884 and \"saw the remains of old crofts, and a curious and perfect circle of stones, lying flat on their sides with the smaller ends towards a common centre, and sunk flush with the surface of the short green sward\". Harvie Brown noted the \"highly polished surface of these nine stones when I first saw them in situ ... as if done by human hands (or feet)\". On his second visit he found the stones gone, and on his fourth visit, in 1903, he searched for the stones in the surrounding area, collected nine he was fairly sure were the originals, and placed them in a new location but in the original plan. His drawing of the time shows a feature of circa 4 m in diameter. He also noted that there were \"at least two, if not more, similar stone circles ... which were not far removed in distance from this principal circle, but these were of smaller dimensions and not formed with so perfectly flat stones\".\n\nFrank Fraser Darling, who lived on the island for a while, refers to Harvie Brown seeing \"what he thought was a stone circle\" and his reconstruction of the feature on an adjacent site: \"they lie there still, and as the sheep graze over them, they do not disappear\".\n\nJim Miller and John Bellord, two men on the run from the law, aided and abetted by Geoff Green, hid on Priest Island for nearly a year, from September 1975 until the summer of 1976. Their story made front page headlines and was the subject of two television documentaries: BBC Everyman: Miller and Bellord, in 1980 and another made by Cineflix, a Canadian film company in 2008.\n\nThe 1794 Statistical Account states that \"there is a large 'cove' on the south side of Priest Island, said to have been the alternative home of a 'Popish priest'.\" According to the \"Scotland's Places\" website (which collates information from various national databases including RCAHMS) this \"cove\" is probably one of the caves on the island, possibly at which \"has been divided by a drystone wall from floor to roof with an opening for communication between the two compartments\". They note that Fraser Darling found a midden there, although all trace of it has now gone. They make no reference to stone circles.\n\nPriest Island is the outermost and most exposed of the Summer Isles, lying about 6 km off the west coast of Wester Ross.\n\nEilean a' Chleirich is owned and managed as a nature reserve by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. It is a SSSI and a Special Protection Area. Non-avian fauna includes pygmy shrews, otters and grey seals.\n\nPriest Island supports heath communities and a small amount of woodland. Enrichment from salt spray and bird guano enables more species-rich maritime heath and cliff communities to exist around the coast. The island has one of the largest storm petrel (\"Hydrobates pelagicus\") colonies in the UK, together with other breeding seabirds.\n\nIn the summer of 1960, a group from an English school studied some of the bird life of the island. Pupils and teachers from Whitgift School in South Croydon spent 2 weeks on the island with official permission to study and ring some of the birds, such as storm petrels at night time (netting and ringing) and shags on the cliffs in daytime. They took a month's supplies with them, including food, tents and equipment totalling quarter of a ton on a trek cart pulled over from Garve Station.\n\n"}

{"id": "2156884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156884", "title": "Malocclusion", "text": "Malocclusion\n\nA malocclusion is a misalignment or incorrect relation between the teeth of the two dental arches when they approach each other as the jaws close. The term was coined by Edward Angle, the \"father of modern orthodontics\", as a derivative of \"occlusion\". This refers to the manner in which opposing teeth meet (\"mal-\" + \"occlusion\" = \"incorrect occlusion\").\n\nThe malocclusion classification is based on the relationship of the Mesiobuccal cusp of the maxillary first molar and the buccal groove of the mandibular first molar.  If this molar relationship exists, then the teeth can align into normal occlusion. According to Angle, malocclusion is any deviation of the occlusion from the ideal.  However the assessment for malocclusion should also take into account aesthetics and the impact on functionality. If these are aspects are acceptable to the patient despite meeting the formal definition of malocclusion, then treatment may not be necessary.\n\nThe aetiology of malocclusion is somewhat contentious, however, simply put it is multifactorial, with influences being both genetic and environmental.  There are 3 generally accepted causative factors of malocclusion:\n\n\nThere is not one cause of malocclusion, and when planning orthodontic treatment it is often helpful to consider the above factors and the impact they have played on malocclusion.  \n\nMalocclusion is a common finding, although it is not usually serious enough to require treatment. Those who have more severe malocclusions, which present as a part of craniofacial anomalies, may require orthodontic and sometimes surgical treatment (orthognathic surgery) to correct the problem.\n\nThe ultimate goal of orthodontic treatment is to achieve a stable, functional and aesthetic alignment of teeth which serves to better the patients dental and total health. The symptoms which arise as a result of malocclusion derive from a deficiency in one or more of these categories.\n\nThe symptoms are as follows:\n\n\nMalocclusions may be coupled with skeletal disharmony of the face, where the relations between the upper and lower jaws are not appropriate. Such skeletal disharmonies often distort sufferer's face shape, severely affect aesthetics of the face, and may be coupled with mastication or speech problems. Most skeletal malocclusions can only be treated by orthognathic surgery.\n\nDepending on the sagittal relations of teeth and jaws, malocclusions can be divided mainly into three types according to Angle's classification system published 1899. However, there are also other conditions, e.g. \"crowding of teeth\", not directly fitting into this classification.\n\nMany authors have tried to modify or replace Angle's classification. This has resulted in many subtypes and new systems (see section below: \"Review of Angle's system of classes\").\n\nA deep bite (also known as a Type II Malocclusion) is a condition in which the upper teeth overlap the lower teeth, which can result in hard and soft tissue trauma, in addition to an effect on appearance. It has been found to occur in 15-20% of the US population.\n\nAn open bite is a condition characterised by a complete lack of overlap and occlusion between the upper and lower incisors. In children, open bite can be caused by prolonged thumb sucking. Patients often present with impaired speech and mastication.\n\nThis is a vertical measurement of the degree of overlap between the maxillary incisors and the mandibular incisors. There are three features that are analysed in the classification of an overbite:\n\n\nAn average overbite is when the upper anterior teeth cover a third of the lower teeth. Covering less than this is described as ‘reduced’ and more than this is an ‘increased’ overbite. No overlap or contact is considered an ‘anterior open bite’.\n\nEdward Angle, who is considered the father of modern orthodontics, was the first to classify malocclusion. He based his classifications on the relative position of the maxillary first molar. According to Angle, the mesiobuccal cusp of the upper first molar should align with the buccal groove of the mandibular first molar. The teeth should all fit on a line of occlusion which, in the upper arch, is a smooth curve through the central fossae of the posterior teeth and cingulum of the canines and incisors, and in the lower arch, is a smooth curve through the buccal cusps of the posterior teeth and incisal edges of the anterior teeth. Any variations from this resulted in malocclusion types. It is also possible to have different classes of malocclusion on left and right sides.\n\n\nA major disadvantage of classifying malocclusions according to Angle's system is that it only takes into consideration the two-dimensional viewing along a spatial axis in the sagittal plane in the terminal occlusion, even though occlusion problems are, in principle, three-dimensional. Deviations in other spatial axes, asymmetric deviations, functional faults and other therapy-related features are not recognised. Another shortcoming is the lack of a theoretical basis of this purely descriptive classification system. Among the much discussed weaknesses of the system is the fact that it only considers the static occlusion, that it does not take into account the development and causes (aetiology) of occlusion problems and it disregards the proportions (or relationships in general) of teeth and face. Thus, numerous attempts have been made to modify the Angle system or to replace it completely with a more efficient one, but Angle's classification continues to prevail mainly because of its simplicity and clarity.\n\nWell-known modifications to Angle's classification date back to Martin Dewey (1915) and Benno Lischer (1912, 1933). Alternative systems have been suggested by, among others, Simon (1930, the first three-dimensional classification system), Jacob A. Salzmann (1950, with a classification system based on skeletal structures) and James L. Ackerman and William R. Proffit (1969).\n\nBesides the molar relationship, the British Standards Institute Classification also classifies malocclusion into incisor relationship and canine relationship.\n\nClass I:\nThe lower incisor edges occlude with or lie immediately below the cingulum plateau of the upper central incisors\n\nClass II:\nThe lower incisor edges lie posterior to the cingulum plateau of the upper incisors\n\nDivision 1 – the upper central incisors are proclined or of average inclination and there is an increase in overjet\n\nDivision 2 – The upper central incisors are retroclined. The overjet is usually minimal or may be increased.\n\nClass III:\nThe lower incisor edges lie anterior to the cingulum plateau of the upper incisors. The overjet is reduced or reversed.\n\nClass I:\nMesial slope of upper canine coincides with distal slope of lower canine\n\nClass II:\nMesial slope of upper canine is ahead of distal slope of lower canine\n\nClass III:\nMesial slope of upper canine is behind to distal slope of lower canine\n\nCrowding is defined by the amount of space that would be required for the teeth to be in correct alignment. It is obtained in two ways. 1) by measuring the amount of space required and reducing this from calculating the space available via the width of the teeth. Or 2) by measuring the degree of overlap of the teeth.\n\nThe following criteria is used:\n\n0-4mm = Mild crowding\n\n4-8mm = Moderate crowding\n\n>8mm = Severe crowding\n\nExtra teeth, lost teeth, impacted teeth, or abnormally shaped teeth have been cited as causes of crowding. Ill-fitting dental fillings, crowns, appliances, retainers, or braces as well as misalignment of jaw fractures after a severe injury are also known to cause crowding. Tumors of the mouth and jaw, thumb sucking, tongue thrusting, pacifier use beyond age three, and prolonged use of a bottle have also been identified. A small underdeveloped jaw, caused by lack of masticatory stress during childhood, can cause tooth overcrowding.\n\nIn an experiment on two groups of rock hyraxes fed hardened or softened versions of the same foods, the animals fed softer food had significantly narrower and shorter faces and thinner and shorter mandibles than animals fed hard food. Experiments have shown similar results in other animals, including primates, supporting the theory that masticatory stress during childhood affects jaw development. Several studies have shown this effect in humans. In one case, children who chewed a hard resinous gum for two hours a day, showed increased facial growth.\n\nDuring the transition to agriculture, the shape of the human mandible went through a series of changes. The mandible underwent a complex shape changes not matched by the teeth, leading to incongruity between the dental and mandibular form. These changes in human skulls may have been \"driven by the decreasing bite forces required to chew the processed foods eaten once humans switched to growing different types of cereals, milking and herding animals about 10,000 years ago.\"\n\nMalocclusion is often treated with orthodontics, such as tooth extraction, clear aligners, or dental braces, followed by growth modification in children or jaw surgery (orthognathic surgery) in adults. Surgical intervention is used only in rare occasions. This may include surgical reshaping to lengthen or shorten the jaw. Wires, plates, or screws may be used to secure the jaw bone, in a manner like the surgical stabilization of jaw fractures. Very few people have \"perfect\" alignment of their teeth with most problems being minor that do not require treatment.\n\nCrowding of the teeth is treated with orthodontics, often with tooth extraction, clear aligners, or dental braces, followed by growth modification in children or jaw surgery (orthognathic surgery) in adults. Surgery may be required on rare occasions. This may include surgical reshaping to lengthen or shorten the jaw (orthognathic surgery). Wires, plates, or screws may be used to secure the jaw bone, in a manner similar to the surgical stabilization of jaw fractures. Very few people have \"perfect\" alignment of their teeth. However, most problems are very minor and do not require treatment.\n\nWhile treatment is not crucial in class I malocclusions, in severe cases of crowding can be an indication for intervention. Studies indicate that tooth extraction can have benefits to correcting malocclusion in individuals. Further research is needed as reoccurring crowding has been examined in other clinical trials.\n\nA few treatment options for class II malocclusions include:\n\n\nLow- to moderate- quality evidence suggests that providing early orthodontic treatment for children with prominent upper front teeth (class II division 1) is more effective for reducing the incidence of incisal trauma than providing one course of orthodontic treatment in adolescence. There do not appear to be any other advantages of providing early treatment when compared to late treatment. Low-quality evidence suggests that, compared to no treatment, late treatment in adolescence with functional appliances is effective for reducing the prominence of upper front teeth.\n\nTreatment can be undertaken using orthodontic treatments using dental braces. While treatment is carried out, there is no evidence from clinical trials to recommend or discourage any type of orthodontic treatment in children. A 2018 Cochrane systematic review anticipated that the evidence base supporting treatment approaches is not likely to improve occlusion due to the low prevalence of the condition and the ethical difficulties in recruiting people to participate in a randomized controlled trials for treating this condition.\n\nThe British Standard Institute (BSI) classify class III incisor relationship as the lower incisor edge lies anterior to the cingulum plateau of the upper incisors, with reduced or reversed over jet. The skeletal facial deformity is characterized by mandibular prognathism, maxillary retrognathism or a combination of the two. This effects 3-8% of UK population with a higher incidence seen in Asia.\n\nOne of the main reasons for correcting Class III malocclusion is aesthetics and function. This can have a psychological impact on the person with malocclusion resulting in speech and mastication problems as well. In mild class III cases, the patient is quite accepting of the aesthetics and the situation is monitored to observe the progression of skeletal growth.\n\nMaxillary and mandibular skeletal changes during prepubertal, pubertal and post pubertal stages show that class III malocclusion is established before the prepubertal stage. One treatment option is the use of growth modification appliances such as the Chin Cap which has greatly improved the skeletal framework in the initial stages. However, majority of cases are shown to relapse into inherited class III malocclusion during the pubertal growth stage and when the appliance is removed after treatment.\n\nAnother approach is to carry out orthognathic surgery, such as a bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) which is indicated by horizontal mandibular excess. This involves surgically cutting through the mandible and moving the fragment forward or backwards for desired function and is supplemented with pre and post surgical orthodontics to ensure correct tooth relationship. Although the most common surgery of the mandible, it comes with several complications including: bleeding from inferior alveolar artery, unfavorable splits, condylar resorption, avascular necrosis and worsening of temporomandibular joint.\n\nOrthodontic camouflage can also be used in patients with mild skeletal discrepancies. This is a less invasive approach that uses orthodontic brackets to correct malocclusion and try to hide the skeletal discrepancy. Due to limitations of orthodontics, this option is more viable for patients who are not as concerned about the aesthetics of their facial appearance and are happy to address the malocclusion only, as well as avoiding the risks which come with orthognathic surgery.\n\nThe most common corrective treatments available are fixed or removal appliances (such as dental braces), which may or may not require surgical intervention. At this time there is no robust evidence that treatment will be successful.\n\nAn open bite malocclusion is when the upper teeth don't overlap the lower teeth. When this malocclusion occurs at the front teeth it is known as anterior open bite. An open bite is difficult to treat due to multifactorial causes, with relapse being a major concern. This is particularly so for an anterior open bite. Therefore, it is important to carry out a thorough initial assessment in order to obtain a diagnosis to tailor a suitable treatment plan. It is important to take into consideration any habitual risk factors, as this is crucial for a successful outcome without relapse. Treatment approach includes behavior changes, appliances and surgery. Treatment for adults include a combination of extractions, fixed appliances, intermaxillary elastics and orthognathic surgery. For children, orthodontics is usually used to compensate for continued growth. With children with mixed dentition, the malocclusion may resolve on its own as the permanent teeth erupt. Furthermore, should the malocclusion be caused by childhood habits such as digit, thumb or pacifier sucking, it may result in resolution as the habit is stopped. Habit deterrent appliances may be used to help in breaking digit and thumb sucking habits. Other treatment options for patients who are still growing include functional appliances and headgear appliances.\n\nIdentifying the presence of tooth size discrepancies between the maxillary and mandibular arches is an important component of correct orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning.\n\nTo establish appropriate alignment and occlusion, the size of upper and lower front teeth, or upper and lower teeth in general, needs to be proportional. Inter-arch tooth size discrepancy (ITSD) is defined as a disproportion in the mesio-distal dimensions of teeth of opposing dental arches. The prevalence is clinically significant among orthodontic patients and has been reported to range from 17% to 30%.\n\nIdentifying inter-arch tooth size discrepancy (ITSD) before treatment begins allows the practitioner to develop the treatment plan in a way that will take ITSD into account. ITSD corrective treatment may entail demanding reduction (interproximal wear), increase (crowns and resins), or elimination (extractions) of dental mass prior to treatment finalization.\n\nSeveral methods have been used to determine ITSD. Of these methods the one most commonly used is the Bolton analysis. Bolton developed a method to calculate the ratio between the mesiodistal width of maxillary and mandibular teeth and stated that a correct and harmonious occlusion is possible only with adequate proportionality of tooth sizes. Bolton's formula concludes that if in the anterior portion the ratio is less than 77.2% the lower teeth are too narrow, the upper teeth are too wide or there is a combination of both. If the ratio is higher than 77.2% either the lower teeth are too wide, the upper teeth are too narrow or there is a combination of both.\n\nOther kinds of malocclusions can be due to or horizontal, vertical, or transverse skeletal discrepancies, including skeletal asymmetries.\n\nIncreased vertical growth causes a long facial profile and commonly leads to an open bite malocclusion, while decreased vertical facial growth causes a short facial profile and is commonly associated with a deep bite malocclusion. However, there are many other more common causes for open bites (such as tongue thrusting and thumb sucking) and likewise for deep bites.\n\nThe upper or lower jaw can be overgrown (macrognathia) or undergrown (micrognathia). It has been reported that patients with micrognathia are also affected by retrognathia (abnormal posterior positioning of the mandible or maxilla relative to the facial structure). These patients are majorly predisposed to a class II malocclusion. Mandibular macrognathia results in prognathism and predisposes patients to a class III malocclusion. \n\nMost malocclusion studies to date have focused on Class III malocclusions. Genetic studies for Class II and Class I malocclusion are more rare. An example of hereditary mandibular prognathism can be seen amongst the Hapsburg Royal family where one third of the affected individuals with severe class III malocclusion had one parent with a similar phenotype \n\nThe frequent presentation of dental malocclusions in patients with craniofacial birth defects also supports a strong genetic aetiology. About 150 genes are associated with craniofacial conditions presenting with malocclusions.   Micrognathia is a commonly recurring craniofacial birth defect appearing among multiple syndromes.\n\nFor patients with severe malocclusions, corrective jaw surgery or orthognathic surgery may be carried out as a part of overall treatment, which can be seen in about 5% of the general population.\n\nMalocclusion is often hereditary but may also be acquired.\n\nThere are 3 general causative factors of malocclusion. These are skeletal factors, muscle factors and dental factors.\n\n\nThese can also be influenced by oral habits and pressure resulting in malocclusion.\n\nIn the active skeletal growth, mouthbreathing, finger sucking, thumb sucking, pacifier sucking, onychophagia (nail biting), dermatophagia, pen biting, pencil biting, abnormal posture, deglutition disorders and other habits greatly influence the development of the face and dental arches.\n\nPacifier sucking habits are also correlated with otitis media.\n\nDental caries, periapical inflammation and tooth loss in the deciduous teeth can alter the correct permanent teeth eruptions.\n\nMalocclusion can occur in primary and secondary dentition. \n\nIn primary dentition malocclusion is caused by:\n\n\nIn secondary dentition malocclusion is caused by:\n\n\n"}

Later he also took on the honorifics Amir al-Mu'minin, Khalifa, Qutb (pole of the universe), vizier of the Mahdi, \"Khalifat Khatim al-Awliya\" (successor of the seal of saints), and \"Almami\" (Imam).\n\nOmar Tall was born about 1794 in Halwar in the Imamate of Futa Toro (present-day Senegal); he was the tenth of twelve children. His father was Saidou Tall, from the Torodbe tribe, and his mother was Sokhna Adama Thiam.\nOmar Tall attended a \"madrassa\" before embarking on the Hajj in 1828, returning in 1830 as a marabout with the title \"El Hadj\" and was initiated into the Tijaniyya, and then assumed the khalifa of the Tijaniyya sufi brotherhood in the Sudan. El-Hadj took the Tijani honorific \"Khalifat Khatim al-Awliya\". This authority would become the basis of his personal authority necessary to lead Africans.\n\nWhen returning from the Hajj he camped near Damascus there he met Ibrahim Pasha, Omar Tall befriended the Pasha healed his son from a deadly fever, Omar Tall was highly inspired by the trends set by the Pasha. Settling in Sokoto from 1831-1837, he took several wives, one of whom was a daughter of the Fula Caliph of the Sokoto Caliphate, Muhammed Bello. In 1836, Omar Tall moved to the Imamate of Futa Jallon and then to Dinguiraye in 1840, in present-day Guinea, where he began preparations for his jihad. There he organized his followers into a professional army of around 50,000 strong, equipped with French weapons and western advisors. In 1852 he proclaimed a jihad against pagans, lapsed Muslims, European intruders, and the backsliding rulers of Futa Toro and Futa Jallon.\n\nOmar Tall claimed a transcendental personal authority. He denied the important of adherence to a Madhhab and favoured Ijtihad or personal religious judgment. He taught that a believer should follow the guidance of a Sufi Shaykh who has immediate personal knowledge of the divine truth. Even though Omar Tall never took the title of either Mujaddid or Mahdi, he was regarded as such by his followers. He became the torodbe ideal of religious revival and conquest of pagans.\n\nOmar Tall appealed to the populace of Futa Toro on the basis of local grievances against the military elites. His community also appealed to rootless individuals of mixed ethnic background who found new social identity and opportunities for conquest under the aegis of Islam. His Jihad began with the conquest of Futa Toro and by 1862 his empire included Timbuktu, Masina, Hamdallahi, and Segu.\n\nIn 1848, Omar Tall's Toucouleur army, equipped with French weapons, invaded several neighboring, pagan, Malinké regions and met with immediate success. Omar Tall pressed on into what is today the region of Kayes in Mali, conquering a number of cities and building a \"tata\" (fortification) near the city of Kayes that is today a popular tourist destination.\n\nIn April 1857, Omar Tall declared war on the Khasso kingdom. He came into conflict with the French who were attempting to establish their commercial supremacy along the Senegal river. Omar Tall besieged the French colonial army at Medina Fort. The siege failed on July 18 of the same year when Louis Faidherbe, French governor of Senegal, arrived with relief forces. In 1860 Omar Tall made a treaty with the French that recognized his, and his followers', sphere of influence in Futa Toro and assigned them the Bambara states of Kaarta and Segu.\n\nAfter his failure to defeat the French, Omar Tall launched a series of assaults on the Bambara kingdoms of Kaarta and Ségou (Segu). The Kaarta capital of Nioro du Sahel fell quickly to Omar Tall's mujahideen, followed by Ségou on 10 March 1861. When Segu fell, their king, Ali Diara (Bina Ali), fled to Hamdullahi taking with him the traditional idols of the royal family. \n\nWhile Omar Tall's wars thus far had been against the animist Bambara or the Christian French, he now turned his attention to the smaller Islamic states of the region. Installing his son Ahmadu Tall as imam of Segu, Omar Tall marched down the Niger, on the Massina Empire imamate of Hamdullahi. More than 70,000 died in the three battles that followed. The most decisive was at Cayawel, where Amadu III, the Masina king, was wounded. Djenné fell quickly followed by the final fall and destruction of Hamdullahi in May 1862.\n\nIn 1862, in the quest for new territory, Omar Tall and his followers invaded the Massina Empire (Masina), whose capital was at Hamdullahi. Ahmad al-Bakkai al-Kunti, of the Qadari Sufi order, led a coalition of local states to resist this invasion which Ahmad denounced as an illegitimate war of Muslims on Muslims. The coalition included, \"inter alia\", Masina and Timbuktu. \n\nOmar Tall captured Hamdullahi on 15 May 1862. Now controlling the entire Middle Niger, Omar Tall moved against Timbuktu, only to be repulsed in 1863 by a combined force of Tuaregs, Moors, and Fulas. During 1863, the coalition inflicted several defeats on Omar Tall's army, ending up killing Tall's generals Alpha Umar (Alfa 'Umar), Thierno Bayla and Alfa 'Uthman.\n\nMeanwhile, a rebellion broke out in the Masina lands led by Ba Lobbo, cousin of executed Masina monarch Amadu III. In suppressing the revolt, In the Spring of 1863, Omar Tall reoccupied the city of Hamdullahi, and in June Balobo's combined force of Fulas and Kountas besieged Omar Tall's army there. Balobo's followers captured Hamdallahi in February 1864. Omar Tall fled and managed to make it to a cave in Degembere (in the Bandiagara Escarpment) where he died on 14 February 1864.\n\nOmar Tall's nephew Tidiani Tall succeeded him as the Toucouleur emperor, though his son Ahmadu Tall, operating out of Ségou, did much of the work in keeping the empire intact. Nonetheless, the French continued to advance, finally entering Ségou itself in 1890. Omar Tall's jihad state was completely absorbed into the growing French West African empire.\n\nOmar Tall remains a prominent figure in Senegal, Guinea, and Mali, though his legacy varies by country. Where many Senegalese tend to remember him as a hero of anti-French resistance, Malian sources tend to describe him as an invader who prepared the way for the French by weakening West Africa. Omar Tall also figures prominently in Maryse Condé's historical novel \"Segu\". He remains to this day an influential figure in the Tijaniyya and other reformist movements, which stressed the importance of Muslim orthopraxy. Omar Tall's state forbade dancing, the use of tobacco, alcohol, charms, pagan ceremonies, and the worship of idols. Many un-Islamic practices were banned. These laws were also very strictly enforced, especially the ban on alcohol. Omar Tall abolished uncanonical taxes and replaced them with zakat, land taxes, and jizya. Polygamists were restricted to only four wives. Omar Tall, however, was uninterested in the logistical aspects of inculcating Islam such as building courts, madrassahs, and mosques. The primary function of Omar Tall's state was predatory warfare, slaving, the accumulation of booty, and the reform of morals.\n\nIn November 2019, the French government returned the sword of Omar Tall to the Senegalese people.\n\nThis article was originally based on a translation of the from the French Wikipedia, retrieved on July 1, 2005, which in turn cites the following sources:\n\nEnglish language sources:\n\n\n"}

He is well known for producing apparel, fragrance, accessories and home fashions for women and men. He was born in Shanghai and raised in Hong Kong. Sung is the brother of late Hong Kong actress Lydia Shum. He is also a founder of Club Monaco, a mid-priced, high-end casual clothing retailer.\n\nSung aspired to become a fine artist contrary to his parents' wishes that he pursue a traditional profession. In time, his father compromised and agreed to send him to Paris where he studied couture at the notable Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne.\n\nAfter graduating with first-place honours, Sung moved to New York City to study at the Parsons School of Design. Upon completion, he began the task of honing his talent while working as an assistant designer for a Seventh Avenue dress manufacturer.\n\nIn 1972, Alfred Sung moved to Canada. His next step was designing for a sportswear manufacturer in Toronto's garment district. After using his fashion illustration skills to supplement his income, Sung opened a tiny shop called Moon initially located on Carlton St. just east of Sherbourne in Toronto's Cabbagetown area around 1977. His loose fitting and comfortable desert colour designs were a major contrast to the black leather and skinny jeans of the prevailing Punk scene.\n\nIn 1980, Sung joined forces with Saul and Joseph Mimran to create Monaco Group Inc., the corporate entity that would develop the \"Alfred Sung\" brand and the ready-to-wear collection directed to working women. Within months, the \"Alfred Sung\" brand appeared in major department and specialty stores across Canada. In 1981, the \"Alfred Sung\" label was launched in the United States through Saks Fifth Avenue, later appearing in Macy's, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman. That same year, Sung opened his first freestanding store in Toronto's Hazelton Lanes. In 1983, Canada's national news magazine, MacLean's, proclaimed Alfred Sung as Canada's \"King of Fashion.\"\n\nIn 1986, with the launch of Parfums Alfred Sung, the Sung trademark its profile by becoming a fragrance brand. \"Sung by Alfred Sung\", the first ladies' perfume launched in 1986, was followed by \"Shi Alfred Sung\" in 2001 and \"Alfred Sung Paradise\" in 2003. In 2005 a new signature fragrance, \"Jewel Alfred Sung\" was launched.\n\nIn 1991, Sung opened a new set of free-standing stores across Canada which housed his premium denim collection for men and women, titled \"Alfred.\" During the same year, Monaco Group Inc changed its name to Mimran Group Inc. Following the success of his ready-to-wear lines, Sung developed a bridal collection sold at specialty boutiques across North America and increased the licensing of his name in several categories, including men's suiting and fragrances, eyewear, watches, furs, luggage and leather goods.\n\nAlfred Sung and the Mimrans have embarked on an aggressive fashion licensing campaign unprecedented in the Canadian fashion industry. The \"Alfred Sung\" licensed product lines include fragrance, eyewear, sunglasses, watches, bridal, jewellery and fashion accessories, men's clothing and accessories, among others. In 2005 the \"Alfred Sung Home\" collection was launched exclusively through Zellers-HBC in Canada, and includes furniture, bedding, bath, home decor, tabletop and kitchen products.

In total he played 60 matches in his Test career, captaining Zimbabwe on 21 occasions. He also played 188 One Day Internationals, being captain in 86 of them. He retired from cricket in 2003.\n\nBorn in Salisbury (now Harare), Campbell started his cricketing career as early as in school times in Eaglesvale High School, Campbell selected for the national side while he was still at the school. He scored his maiden first-class century by becoming the youngest Zimbabwean to do so.\n\nA left-handed batsman, Campbell batted in the middle order in Test cricket but usually opened in One Day International cricket. After becoming the youngest ever Zimbabwean to make a first-class century he was selected for the 1992 World Cup in Australia, aged 19. He struggled throughout but in the coming years managed to cement his spot in the national side. On the 1993–94 Pakistan tour he scored 3 half centuries against the likes of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis.\n\nIn October 1994 he fell painfully short of his maiden Test century when he was dismissed by Sri Lankan paceman Ravindra Pushpakumara for 99. This remained his highest Test score for five years until he brought up 3 figures against India at Nagpur in 2000–01. He scored one more Test century in his career, an innings of 103 the following season against the West Indies.\n\nHe was more successful in the ODI arena, making over 5000 runs and maintaining an average of over 30. His most prolific year was in 2000 when he made 960 runs at 38.40. Of his 7 hundreds, 2 of them were made against Australia.\n\nCampbell took over the captaincy of Zimbabwe in 1996. He led them to a series victory in Pakistan in 1998–99, and also led the team to the Super Six stage of the 1999 World Cup. After 3 years in charge he stood down from the captaincy for what he stated as 'personal reasons'.\n\nIn the 1998 inaugural ICC Knockout Trophy (now renamed as ICC Champions Trophy), Campbell became the first batsman to score a century.\n\nAfter not being selected for the 2003 World Cup, Campbell announced his retirement from international cricket only to reconsider when he was chosen to replace an injured Mark Vermeulen. Zimbabwe's final match of the World Cup turned out to be the final match of Campbell's career as he was never selected again for his country.\n\nIn July 2009, Campbell was re-inducted into Zimbabwe cricket after being selected chairman of their Cricket Committee, a major step in the revival of the sport in the nation. He is also the chief selector of the Zimbabwean national cricket team.\n\nCampbell worked as a selector in the cricket administration of Zimbabwe, where he resigned from the position in October 2011. He also resigned as chair of the cricket committee in 2012.\n\nIn 2015, he was appointed as the managing director of Zimbabwe Cricket, by replacing Wilfred Mukondiwa. However in July of the same year, Zimbabwean allrounder Prosper Utseya criticized Campbell's actions as the chairman, alleging that he was a victim of racism because of these actions. Due to these incidents, Campbell resigned from the chairman role as Zimbabwe Cricket's director of international cricket and commercial affairs on 22 October 2015.\n"}

Their music blends folk, swamp pop, New Orleans rhythm and blues, Louisiana blues, country, cajun/zydeco, funk, soul and gospel with harmonic vocals. Their sound is notable for the band's substitution of a tambourine player for a drummer. The subdudes formed in 1987 through a music venue in New Orleans called Tipitina's.\n\nThe Subdudes often credit their songwriting to the group as a whole, although the primary songwriters are Tommy Malone (brother of The Radiators guitarist Dave Malone) and John Magnie, both former members of Little Queenie and the Percolators. Current members of the band are Malone, vocals, acoustic, electric and slide guitars; Magnie, vocals, accordion, keyboards; Steve Amedée, tambourine, drums, other percussions, and vocals; Tim Cook, percussion, bass and vocals; and Jimmy Messa, bass and guitar. They are an Americana band with a rock-based sound that also shows soul, gospel, blues, cajun/zydeco, country, and other American roots music influences. Their former bass player was Johnny Ray Allen, who had not been with the band since their 1996 farewell tour (documented the next year on the \"Live at Last\" CD) until a brief reunion in 2014. Willie Williams also contributed to three albums: \"Annunciation\", \"Primitive Streak\" and \"Live at Last\" as a second guitarist. \"Annunciation\" (1994) was produced by legendary record producer Glyn Johns, who also produced The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Kinks, and Crosby, Stills and Nash among others.\n\nAfter regrouping in 2002 (first as The Dudes but then re-adopting the name 'subdudes' in March 2003), Bob Dylan's guitarist Freddy Koella helped produce \"Miracle Mule\". The album \"Behind the Levee\" (2006) was produced by bluesman Keb' Mo' and yielded a minor hit, \"Papa Dukie and the Mud People\" (better known by its refrain, \"Love is a Beautiful Thing\"). Released in late 2007, the album \"Street Symphony\" was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee at Blackbird Studios in March 2007 and was produced by George Massenburg, who has worked with Little Feat. Released in late 2008, \"Live at the Ram's Head\" is available on CD or as a two DVD set, with one disc being the live show from \"The Ram's Head\" in Annapolis, Maryland, and the second DVD being \"Unplugged at Pleasant Plains\", with interviews and live studio footage from the recording of \"Street Symphony\" in Nashville.\n\nMost recently (2009), the band's self-produced \"Flower Petals\" was recorded in Magnie's basement studio then mixed in Miami, Florida by The Albert Brothers and Steve Alaimo. The album was a departure for the band, being much more country-oriented than previous releases. The cover art was by William Matthews, a Denver, Colorado artist well known for his Old West-style paintings. \"Flower Petals\" was originally slated to be recorded as the follow-up to \"Miracle Mule\" in 2004 but was nixed by the band's record company at the time, Back Porch Records. Five years later, the band members financed the recording themselves then shopped around the completed tapes.\n\nThe Subdudes' stature as New Orleans musicians was reflected by their inclusion individually and as a group in the HBO series \"Treme\".\n\nAfter a hiatus starting in 2011, the original line-up reunited in March 2014, with Johnny Ray Allen on bass. Allen died on August 8, 2014 at age 56. The band has continued to tour with Tim Cook on bass.\n\n\n"}

Child-motivated absenteeism occurs autonomously, by the volition of the child. This behavior is differentiated from non-child-motivated absences in which parents who withdraw children from school or keep them home, or circumstances such as homelessness. School refusal is characterized by an emotional distress at the time of attending school and school attendance difficulties.\n\nSchool refusal behavior has no single cause. Rather it has a broad range of contributing factors that include the individual, family, school, and community. These factors can be organized into four main categories: (1) avoidance of school‐based stimuli that cause negative affect, (2) avoidance of stressful social and/or evaluative situations, (3) pursuit of attention from significant others, and/or (4) pursuit tangible reinforcers outside of school.\n\nRates of absenteeism due to school refusal behavior are difficult to quantify because the behavior manifests in a variety of ways and are defined, tracked, and reported differently among schools and school districts. The literature estimates that rates of school refusal occurs in 1–2% of the general population, and in 5–15% of clinic-referred youth samples.\n\nSchool refusal behavior is characterized by an emotional and behavioral component. The emotional component consists of severe emotional distress at the time attending school. The behavioral component manifests as school attendance difficulties. School refusal is not classified as a disorder by the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" [DSM-5].\n\nEmotional distress typically does not occur until the morning before the child is to attend school. Emotional distress is often accompanied by physical symptoms. The degree of distress children exhibit varies widely. There is also an instant return to a stable mood after the child decides not to attend school or is removed from school.\n\nSchool attendance difficulties include a broad range of behaviors. The spectrum of refusal spans from occasional reluctance to complete refusal. Students may miss the entire day, a partial day, skip class, or arrive late.\n\nBecause school refusal behavior is a multifaceted issue, there is not a single valid measure or assessment method for diagnosis. Assessment first involves measuring and evaluating the number of days the child is absent, late, or leaving school early. Parent reports and self-reports from the child regarding emotional distress and resistance to attendance are taken into account. Assessment aims to (1) confirm that the behavior represents school refusal as opposed to truancy or legitimate absence, (2) evaluate the extent and severity of absenteeism, (3) the type(s) and severity of emotional distress, (4) obtain information regarding the child, family, school, and community factors that may be contributing to the behavior, and (5) use the information obtained to develop a working hypothesis that is used for planning appropriate interventions. Tools used to obtain information about school refusal behavior include clinical behavioral interviews, diagnostic interviews, self-report measures of internalizing symptoms, self-monitoring, parent- and teacher-completed measures of internalizing and externalizing problems, review of attendance record, and systematic functional analysis.\n\nSchool refusal behavior is a heterogeneous behavior characterized by a variety of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Internalizing symptoms include anxiety (general, social, and separation anxiety), social withdrawal, fatigue, fear, and/or depression. Children may also have complaints of somatic symptoms such as headaches, stomachaches, or a sore throat. Children may also exhibit externalizing symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, sweating, diarrhea, or difficulties breathing as a result of their anxiety. Other externalizing symptoms include defiance, aggression, tantrums, clinging to a parent, refusing to move, and/or running away. If the child stays home from school, these symptoms might go away but come back the next morning before school.\n\nResearchers are motivated to assess and treat this behavior because of its prevalence and potential negative consequences.  Short-term negative consequences of school refusal for the child include distress, social alienation, and declining grades. Familial conflict and legal trouble may also result. Excessive absenteeism is commonly associated with various negative health and social problems. \n\nProblematic school absenteeism is also associated with illicit drug use (including tobacco), suicide attempt, poor nutrition, risky sexual behavior, teenage pregnancy, violence, injury, driving under the influence of alcohol, and binge drinking.\n\nSchool refusal behavior includes absenteeism due to a broad range of potential causes. School refusal can be classified by the primary factor that motivates the child's absence. The School Refusal Assessment Scale identifies four functional causes: (1) avoiding school‐based stimuli that provoke negative affectivity, (2) escaping aversive social and/or evaluative situations, (3) pursuing attention from significant others, and/or (4) pursuing tangible rewards outside of school. Categories one and two refer to school refusal motivated by negative reinforcement. Categories three and four represent refusal for positive reinforcement.\n\nThe onset of school refusal can be sudden or gradual. In cases of sudden onset, refusal often begins after a period of legitimate absence. The problem may start following vacations, school holidays, or brief illness. It can also occur after a stressful event, such as moving to a new house, or the death of a pet or relative. Gradual onset emerges over time as a few sporadically missed days become a pattern of non-attendance.\n\nThere are a broad range of risk factors, which may interact and change over time. Within the literature the risk factors are typically condensed into four categories: individual, family, school, and community.\n\nThere are a variety of primary and comorbid disorders associated with school avoidance behavior. Common diagnoses include separation anxiety disorder (22.4%), generalized anxiety disorder (10.5%), oppositional defiant disorder (8.4%), depression (4.9%), specific phobia (4.2%), social anxiety disorder (3.5%), and conduct disorder (2.8%). Negative reinforcement school refusal behavior is associated with anxiety-related disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder. Attention-seeking school refusal behavior is associated with separation-anxiety disorder. School refusal classified by the pursuit of tangible reinforcement is associated with conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder.\n\nThe primary goal of treatment for school refusal behavior is for the child to regularly and voluntarily attend school with less emotional distress. Some scholars also emphasize the importance of helping the child manage social, emotional, and behavioral problems that are the result of prolonged school nonattendance. Treatment of school refusal depends on the primary cause of the behavior and the particular individual, family, and school factors affecting the child. Analysis of the child's behavior often involves the perspective of the parent/family, school, and child. When school refusal is motivated by anxiety, treatment relies mostly on child therapy during which children learn to control their anxiety with relaxation training, enhancement of social competence, cognitive therapy, and exposure. For children who refuse school in pursuit of attention from parents, parent training is often the focus of treatment. Parents are taught to set routines for their children and punish and reward them appropriately. For children refusing school in pursuit of rewards outside of school, treatment often takes a family-based approach, using family-based contingency contracting and communication skills training. In some instances, children may also engage in peer refusal skills training.\n\nThere are no accurate figures regarding the prevalence of school refusal behavior because of the wide variation in how the behavior is defined, tracked, and reported across schools, school districts, and countries. The most widely accepted prevalence rate is 1–2% of school-aged children. In clinic-referred youth samples the prevalence rate is 5–15%. There are no known relationships between school refusal behavior and gender, income level, or race. While refusal behavior can occur at any time, it occurs more frequently during major changes in a child’s life, such as entering kindergarten (ages 5–6), changing from elementary to middle school (ages 10–11), or changing from middle to high school (age 14).\n\nThere has been little consensus on the best method for organizing and classifying children demonstrating school refusal behavior. School refusal was initially termed psychoneurotic truancy and characterized as a school phobia. The terms fear‐based school phobia, anxiety‐based school refusal, and delinquent‐based truancy are commonly were described school refusal behavior. In early studies, children were diagnosed with a school phobia when they exhibited (1) persistent difficulties attending school, (2) severe emotional upset at the prospect of going to school, (3) parental knowledge of the absence, and (4) no antisocial characteristics. This criteria was later declared inadequate in capturing the full range of school refusal behavior. While the term school phobia is still commonly employed, this anxiety-based classification is not appropriate for all cases of school refusal. School refusal is now considered an umbrella term for non-truent problematic absenteeism, regardless of the root cause.\n\n"}
{"id": "2156935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156935", "title": "Wolfdietrich", "text": "Wolfdietrich\n\nWolfdietrich is the eponymous protagonist of the Middle High German heroic epic \"Wolfdietrich\". First written down in strophic form in around 1230 by an anonymous author, it survives in four main versions, widely differing in scope and content, and largely independent of each other.\n\n\"Wolfdietrich\" is closely associated with another heroic epic poem of the same period, \"Ortnit\". The two stories have distinct (if disputed) origins but they were combined at an early stage, possibly by a single author, and appear together in most sources. In the earliest surviving version of the first story, Ortnit is killed by two dragons sent by his father-in-law after he abducts and marries his daughter; in the second, Wolfdietrich, deprived of his inheritance by two brothers and an evil counsellor, sets out to seek Ortnit's help but, finding he has been killed, avenges him by killing the dragons, he then defeats his brothers and the counsellor, and marries Ortnit's widow.\n\nWhile the earliest version is similar to other heroic epics such as the Nibelungenlied, the tale gradually accretes more episodes, becoming a popular adventure story.\n\nWith their motifs of the bride-quest, inheritance regained, faithful and faithless vassals, dragon-killing, magic suits of armour, and encounters with dwarves, witches and giants, this pair of stories remained continuously popular, repeatedly re-cast, copied and, later, printed until the early 17th century. This makes it one of the most long-lived and popular German narratives of the medieval and early modern period.\n\nThough \"Wolfdietrich\" and \"Ortnit\" do not seem originally to have been among the legends surrounding Theodoric the Great, the Dietrich of Bern cycle, Wolfdietrich became identified as the grandfather of Dietrich and material from the two stories found its way into a number of Dietrich tales, including the Old Norse Thidreksaga.\n\nThe story survives in four versions. Three of these (A,B,C) are largely independent of each other, and each gives Wolfdietrich a different birthplace. The fourth, D, is a compilation of material from versions B and C.\n\nWolfdietrich A (\"Wolfdietrich of Constantinople\") is the oldest version, written around 1230, though only surviving in a much later manuscript, the Ambraser Heldenbuch (MS A). The first 505 strophes (A1) are probably written by the same author as the version of Ortnit which precedes it in the manuscript, but the remaining 101 strophes (A2) show a more condensed narration by a continuator using material from the tradition of Wolfdietrich B. The end of the story is missing in the Ambraser Heldenbuch (it ends as Wolfdieterich's sword breaks in his fight against the dragon), but can be reconstructed from the Dresden Heldenbuch of 1472, which draws on the same source as MS A.\n\nWolfdietrich B (\"Wolfdietrich of Saloniki\") greatly expands the story of Wolfdietrich's youth.\n\nWolfdietrich C (\"Wolfdietrich of Athens\") survives only in five widely spread fragments, one of which is now missing.\n\nWolfdietrich D is the most extensive version (hence \"The Large Wolfdietrich\") and combines material from versions B and C as well as a further, unknown version related to B. With 10 manuscripts and six printed editions it is \"one of the great literary successes of the late Middle Ages\".\n\nKing Ortnit of Lambarten (Lombardy) abducts Liebgarte, the daughter of King Machorel. Under the guise of an attempt at reconciliation, Machorel sends Ortnit two dragon eggs, and the dragons terrorise the kingdom after they hatch. After a year Ortnit sets out to defeat the dragons, but is caught asleep and killed by them. His widow is forced into seclusion, to await the birth of Ortnit's avenger.\n\nWolfdietrich is born as third son to Hugdietrich, King of Greece. The king's evil counsellor Sabene persuades him that the child is the spawn of the devil, and Duke Berchtung of Meran is ordered to kill him. But Berchtung saves the child and brings about the banishment of Sabene.\n\nAfter Hugdietrich's death, Sabene returns to Constantinople and persuades the two elder brothers to banish the queen and deprive Wolfdietrich, now living in Berchtung's castle Lilienport, of his inheritance. Wolfdietrich leads a military campaign against his brothers but it fails and he is besieged in Lilienport. After four years he breaks out and makes his way to seek help from King Ortnit.\n\nHe eventually makes his way to Garte, where he finds Ortnit's widow lamenting her husband's death. He defeats the dragons, marries Liebgart, and becomes King of Lambarten.\n\nDisguised as a pilgrim, Wolfdietrich reconnoitres Constantinople, where Berchtung's sons are being held captive by his brothers. After recovering his wife, who had been abducted in the meantime, he sails to Greece, where after a successful siege of his brothers he has Sabene executed and rewards his faithful vassals. He then returns to Lambarten.\n\nVarious theories have attempted to connect Wolfdietrich (and his father Hugdietrich) with historical persons from the Germanic Migration Period:\nHowever, there is no consensus on these theories, and it can be argued that the many anti-historical elements essential to the story (rescue by wolves, magic armour, giants, dragons) suggest it combines a variety of legendary and fantastic sources divorced from any specific historical personalities. In this view \"Wolfdietrich\" is essentially a montage, which draws on not only the heroic epic, but also the chanson de geste, crusade literature, the bride-quest story, and other sources, with what Miklautsch calls a \"hybrid hero\".\n\n\"Wolfdietrich\" and \"Ortnit\" are written in a strophic form called the \"Hildebrandston\" (similar to the Nibelungenstrophe used in the Nibelungenlied and Kudrun). It consists of four long-lines: each long-line has three feet with a feminine ending, a caesura, then three feet with a rhymed masculine ending.\n\nThe strophes are marked in the manuscripts by a Lombardic capital.\n\nIn the printed Heldenbücher, the \"Hildebrandston\" is transformed into the \"Heunenweise\", an eight-line strophe: the long-line is split at the caesura and unrhymed line-endings are given rhymes, with the resulting rhyme scheme ABABCDCD. This necessarily involved considerable rewriting of the text:\nThe four versions of \"Wolfdietrich\" survive in 11 complete manuscripts and several fragments of a twelfth. In many cases \"Wolfdietrich\" (and \"Ortnit\") form part of a larger collection under the title of \"Heldenbuch\" (\"Book of Heroes\").\n\n\nThe MSS of \"Wolfdietrich B\" do not include \"Ortnit\".\n\n\nTen manuscripts from the late 15th and early 16th centuries, including\n\nIn 1479 Johann Prüss printed a Heldenbuch which included \"Ornit\", \"Wolfdietrich\" and three other works, with 230 woodcuts. The text came primarily from the source used in the Heldenbuch of Diebolt von Hanow (MS c). It was subsequently reprinted, with variations and different woodcuts, by others in 1491, 1509, 1545, 1560 and 1590.\n\nThe Strassburg Heldenbuch was used as the source for a dramatic trilogy by Jakob Ayrer published in 1618:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Since 1976, Allen has issued 12 albums and charted 14 singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. She recorded the 1983 crossover hit \"Baby I Lied\", which reached No. 4 on the country chart and No. 26 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Allen has also written No. 1 singles for herself, Janie Fricke, and John Conlee; Top 5 hits for Patty Loveless and Tanya Tucker; and a Top 10 hit for The Whites.\n\nAllen was born Deborah Lynn Thurmond in Memphis, Tennessee, United States. She was a beauty queen when she was a teenager.\n\nMusically, she was influenced by Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Aretha Franklin, Al Green, Ray Charles, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin and the current music which was being played in Memphis on WHBQ and WDIA, as well as country musicians such as Brenda Lee, Patsy Cline, Tammy Wynette, Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash. At 19, Allen moved to Nashville to begin pursuing her career in music. She worked a short stint as a waitress at the local Music Row IHOP restaurant. While there one day, Deborah met Roy Orbison and songwriter Joe Melson. Two weeks later, Orbison and Melson, who admired her spunk, decided to hire Allen to sing background on a couple of Orbison tracks.\n\nAllen also auditioned for and landed a job at the Opryland USA theme park. She was soon chosen by Opryland as a featured soloist and dancer for a state department exchange tour of Russia starring Tennessee Ernie Ford.\n\nUpon her return from Russia, Allen gravitated to the Nashville offices of Waylon Jennings, the Tompall & the Glaser Brothers and John Hartford where her close friend, Marie Barrett, worked as a secretary. There she met her soon-to-be songwriting mentor, poet, playwright, artist and songwriter Shel Silverstein. After watching her perform during a happy hour show at the Spence Manor on Nashville's Music Row, Silverstein advised Allen to pursue songwriting as an extension of her creativity and career path.\n\nAllen also began to pursue a singing career in her own right when she was chosen to be a regular on Jim Stafford's ABC summer replacement series. She went on to serve as an opening act for many of Stafford's personal appearances. Jim and producer Phil Gernhard brought Allen back to Nashville to record a CB radio novelty record called \"Do You Copy\". It was recorded live and was released as a single on Warner Bros. Records. Although she appreciated the opportunity to record with Stafford and Gernhard, Allen was disheartened that after waiting patiently for two years to record her first record, it was a novelty tune. She decided to move back to Nashville to follow her true musical direction.\n\nIn 1979, while singing at a private party, she was discovered by producer Bud Logan, who invited her to sing on five unfinished duet tracks by the late Jim Reeves. Three of these songs were \"Don't Let Me Cross Over,\" \"Oh, How I Miss You Tonight\" and \"Take Me in Your Arms and Hold Me.\" All three duets were released as singles, and made the Top 10 on the country charts for Reeves' longtime label, RCA Records. She was billed as \"The Mystery Singer\" on the first release, an innovative promotion by label head, Joe Galante.\n\nIn 1980, Allen signed with Capitol Records. Her debut album for the label was 1980's \"Trouble in Paradise.\" The album produced her initial solo hit \"Nobody's Fool\" peaking at No. 24 on Billboard country chart. Subsequent chart singles included (although none never made it on to an album) \"You (Make Me Wonder Why),\" \"You Look Like the One I Love\" (a song she had co-written) and \"After Tonight,\" co-written by Troy Seals, each peaking at #20, #33 and #82 on Billboard Country Chart. At the same time, Allen had written a song called \"Don't Worry 'Bout Me Baby\" with Bruce Channel and Kieran Kane. Although she pleaded with her record label, Capitol, to let her record it and release it as a single, they refused. With the encouragement of music publisher Don Gant, Janie Fricke's producer, Jim Ed Norman, heard \"Don't Worry 'Bout Me Baby\" and recorded it with Fricke. The single became Deborah's first No. 1 single on the Billboard charts as a songwriter.\n\nBy 1982, she had begun collaborating with Rafe Van Hoy for songwriting. The couple married that year.\n\nIn 1983, Deborah moved to RCA Records, where she achieved her greatest success, releasing the album \"Cheat the Night.\" The first single from the album, \"Baby I Lied\", became Allen's signature song and only crossover hit. The song peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard country chart and crossed over to the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, reaching No. 26 in January 1984. The song also climbed into the Top 10 of the Adult Contemporary chart. Allen followed the crossover hit with the country single \"I've Been Wrong Before\", which went to No. 1 on the Cashbox country chart and #2 on Billboard Country Chart in the spring of 1984. It also earned her nominations for the Grammy Award for Best Country Song and Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Female. Later that year, \"I Hurt For You\", also from Allen's breakthrough album, became a Top 10 country hit. In 1984, she recorded \"Let Me Be the First\", the first album to be digitally recorded in, and released from, Nashville. In 1984, Allen made the charts once again with \"Heartache and a Half\" (written by Allen with her then-husband, Rafe Van Hoy and Muscle Shoals songwriter Eddie Struzick).\n\nIn 1987, Allen released a single called \"Telepathy\" written by Prince, under the alias \"Joey Coco\". An album of the same name was also issued and was considered more pop oriented. In 1987, Allen released her last single for RCA, \"You're the Kind of Trouble\".\n\nAfter the No. 1 co-written hit, \"Don't Worry 'Bout Me Baby\" and the Tanya Tucker hit \"Can I See You Tonight\", Allen won another No. 1 for Janie Frickie, \"Let's Stop Talking About It\", as well as the No. 1 John Conlee release, \"I'm Only in It for the Love\", which she co-wrote with Kix Brooks and Van Hoy.\n\nDuring this time, Allen recorded the album \"Delta Dreamland\" which she co-produced and financed on her own. She then signed a contract with Giant Records to release the album under their label in 1993. The first single released was \"Rock Me (In the Cradle of Love)\", which charted at No. 29 on the Billboard country chart. The video of \"Rock Me\" was filmed on Allen's own 16mm Ariflex SR film camera and edited on her own Sony editing machine. Allen won the Music City Summit Award for her co-producing and co-directing. Allen also had one other charting single from the \"Delta Dreamland\" album with, \"If You're Not Gonna Love Me\".\n\nAllen's 1994 album, \"All That I Am\", which was co-produced by Allen and label head James Stroud, was also well received with her single release \"Break These Chains\".\n\nIn addition to Allen's personal albums, she contributed to the soundtrack of the 1993 film \"The Thing Called Love\" performing \"Blame It on Your Heart\" (also covered by Patty Loveless) and the Don Schlitz ballad \"Ready and Waiting\".\n\nAllen signed a co-publishing deal and record deal with Curb music publishing and Curb Records. She released one album with Curb Records in 2000, titled \"The Best Of\", that included a new version of her 1983 hit \"Baby I Lied\". Five of Allen's songs were recorded by LeAnn Rimes. Two of Allen's songs appeared on the multi-platinum \"Blue\" album and three songs on her \"Sittin' On Top of the World\" album. Allen's song \"We Can Get There\", performed by Mary Griffin, appeared in the film \"Coyote Ugly\"\".\n\nAllen\"s album \"Hear Me Now\" was released through Delta Rock Records and GMV Nashville on August 16, 2011. The first single was \"Anything Other Than Love\", co-written by Gary Burr. The album also contains Allen's song \"Amazing Graceland\", a tribute to Elvis Presley.\n\nAllen's publishing companies, Delta Queen Music and Delta Rose Music are currently co-published with partner Delta Rock Music. She is represented by Raymond Hicks of Rolling Thunder Management.\n\nIn 2013, she released her first Christmas album, \"Rockin' Little Christmas\", through Weblast Records, and played Christmas shows at the Fontanel Mansion in Nashville, that same year.\n\nOn March 22, 2019, Bill Lee, the Governor of Tennessee, officially designated June 5, 2019 as a Day of Recognition to honor Allen.\n\nIn a 2019 interview with \"Guitar Girl\", Allen shared that she was physically abused by her first husband. Allen lives in Franklin, Tennessee. She is married to music producer and promoter Raymond Hicks. Allen is a Christian.\n\n"}

The inaugural season was in 2005. Rally America was also the name given to the organization that sanctioned the championship, was briefly rebranded to RallyCar in July 2010, then reverted to Rally America the following year. 2018 was the final year that Rally America sanctioned a rally event. In 2019 Rally America briefly became a media organization with the stated goal of promoting rally in the United States before ceasing all social media posts and shutting down its web site.\n\nRally America was founded in 2002 by CPD Rally Team owner Doug Havir, who provided scoring and reporting services to the Sports Car Club of America's ProRally Championship. The two companies worked in tandem until the end of the 2004 season, when the SCCA withdrew its involvement in U.S. stage rallying. The SCCA then made the decision to sell all commercial and sanctioning rights to Rally America.\n\nIn 2005, the inaugural Rally America National Championship was run, incorporating most of the events previously sanctioned by the SCCA. In 2011, Vermont businessman Bill Fogg took over ownership of Rally America from Havir.\n\nThe points are awarded based on final position, as well as achieving a point for starting the race and one point for finishing the race. Thus, finishing a race will automatically earn the driver three points: one for starting, one for finishing, and one for coming in 10th+ place. \nRally America did not maintain manufacturer scoring or provide recognition for vehicle successes. Most cars are selected by their drivers or teams with the vast majority being entered without any special involvement by their manufacturers.\n\nSubaru was an integral part of Rally America from its inception. The Subaru WRX STi version of the Impreza vehicle, had already become the most numerous competitive rally car in North America. Subaru became a sponsor of the series and many prizes and other incentives were provided by the company both for rally in general, and Subaru driving teams in particular. A fully stocked parts truck was dispatched to all national events, offering Subaru teams unique access to parts and expertise on scene. There were discounts on parts for teams using Subaru Rally Team USA parts.\n\nMitsubishi was Subaru's primary competitor in North America, with its Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution series of cars. In the hands of competitive drivers, the Evo proved a challenge to the larger quantity of WRXs, often edging into top three finishes.\n\nFord Motor Company has had a long history in rallying item rallycross both World Rally Championship and in North America. Ford made a unique appearance in American rallying at the 2009 X Games. Driven by Tanner Foust, Ken Block and Brian Deegan, three open-class Ford Fiestas were dominant (two of the three claimed podium positions) throughout the weekend. Block, the eventual winner, praised the car, while Foust has said he would like to see a factory-backed Ford Racing team competing regularly in Rally America. For 2010, Ford announced that they would be sponsoring a Fiesta in Rally America and the X-Games.\n\nWhile not often contending for top overall spots they were good cars for those contesting the two-wheel-drive championships and for beginners. The Volkswagen Jetta, Volkswagen Golf and Volkswagen Beetle all had many appearances and much success in Rally America events.\n\nThe Scion Rally xD debuted in the two-wheel-drive category at the 2010 Oregon Trail Rally with Christopher Duplessis at the wheel. In 2011, Duplessis switched to a Ford, and the Scion xD was piloted by Andrew Comrie-Picard.\n\nIn 2009, Rally America narrowed down the number of championships. The regional rallies have many categories split into two events, such as 2 Wheel Drive being split into a separate championship for Group 2 and Group 5, as well as the addition of an Open Light. A list of the full rules can be seen at the Rally America website. \n\nThe engine is turbo charged and must be based on a production engine with the power being limited by the use of an inlet restrictor. The body must be recognizable as the original car. There is a minimum weight also enforced dependent on the engine.\n\n2.5L or less naturally aspirated 4wd production vehicles with no minimum weight. Like the open class the body must be recognizable as the original car.\n\nThe chassis generation must match the appearance and modifications of the car. Thus, one can take a chassis from a 2006 Subaru WRX and put a 2003 WRX shell around it, but all parts must be allowable for a 2003 WRX. Engine displacement cannot be more than 2.6 liter with multipliers, and a limiter is placed on any forced induction system. A minimum weight is also enforced. Many other parts can be replaced, as long as they are an option from the manufacturer.\n\nThese are based on the old FIA Group 5 and Group 2 standards. Both are limited on weight, displacement, and must be based on cars with a production of 1000 per year. Power may be sent to either the rear wheels or the front wheels.\n\n"}
{"id": "2156958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156958", "title": "Ortnit", "text": "Ortnit\n\nOrtnit is the eponymous protagonist of the Middle High German heroic epic \"Ortnit\". First written down in strophic form in around 1230 by an anonymous author, it circulated in a number of distinct versions.\n\nIn the earliest version, King Ortnit sets out on an expedition to make the daughter of the heathen King Machorel his bride. He is greatly assisted by the cunning of the dwarf Alberich, who can only be seen by the wearer of a magic ring, and by the martial prowess of the Russian king Ilyas, Ortnit's uncle. In the second part of the story, Machorel, enraged by Ortnit's abduction of his daughter, sends him, in a feigned gesture of reconciliation, two dragon eggs. When these hatch, the dragons terrorise the land. After a year's delay, Ortnit sets out to kill the dragons, but falls asleep and is killed by them.\n\nIn most of the surviving versions, this is followed by the story of Wolfdietrich, who avenges Ortnit's death and marries his widow. Though the two stories have distinct origins, they were possibly combined and integrated at an early stage. The earliest surviving versions, \"Ortnit A\" and \"Wolfdietrich A\" may be the work of a single author.\n\nThe bride-quest and dragon motifs come from older oral traditions, but a strong crusading element in the journey to the Levant and defeat of a heathen army reflects the concerns of the 13th century. There is no consensus about the origins of the figure of Ortnit himself.\n\nWith a dozen manuscripts, six printed editions and a theatrical adaptation, the story remained popular right up until the early 17th century.\n\n \n\nThe story of Ortnit survives in eight narrative versions, grouped in four main traditions:\n\nOrtnit A (also Ortnit AW, after the two manuscripts) is the oldest version, written around 1230, containing 597 strophes. A later adaptation in the Dresden Heldenbuch condenses the text to about a third of the length.\n\nOrtnit C survives only in two fragments containing around 60 strophes of \"Ortnit\" with material close to that of Ortnit A.\n\nOrtnit D, written around 1300, combines material from version C and a further, unknown version. Version D survives in four different variants from the 15th and 16th centuries: \n\nA verse drama in rhyming couplets by Jakob Ayrer published in 1618, \"Vom dem keiser Ottnit, was er biss and sein Endt erstritten und ausgericht, auff das Getreulichst der Histori nach\" is based on Ortnit D.\n\nWolfdietrich B is not accompanied by a separate \"Ortnit\" tale. Instead, the stories are integrated: Wolfdietrich meets Ortnit, defeats him in battle and gains his friendship; Ortnit later kills two giants and a dragon but is then killed in his sleep by a second dragon.\n\nI. (Strophes 1–69) In his castle at Garda, King Ortnit of Lambarten (Lombardy) tells his vassals that he means to seek a wife, and one of them, his uncle Ilyas, King of Russia, mentions the beautiful daughter of Machorel of Muntabur (Mount Tabor), a heathen king. In spite of the fact that Machorel kills any suitor for his daughter, intending to marry her himself once his wife is dead, Ortnit sets his heart on her.\n\nII. (70–212) Delayed from setting out by winter weather, he is given a ring by his mother, who tells him it will lead to adventure. Following her instructions, he rides off into the wilderness until he encounters what he takes to be a child, who can only be seen by the one wearing the ring. After they have argued and fought - the child is unexpectedly strong - the child reveals himself to be the dwarf Alberich and Ortnit's natural father (having stepped in when Ortnit's parents were unable to conceive). He gives Ortnit a suit of golden armour with magical properties and vows to accompany him.\n\nIII. (213–287) Ortnit and his army set sail from Messina and, after 10 days at sea, arrive off the coast of Tyre, Machorel's capital. Alberich gives Ortnit a magic stone which allows him to speak and understand any language, and this enables him to pose as a merchant to secure permission to dock. Ortnit wants to take the city immediately, riding through the open gates, but Alberich insists this would be dishonourable. Instead, Alberich goes to Muntabur and gives Machorel a formal challenge: to give his daughter to Ortnit or be attacked. Machorel refuses and flies into a range.\n\nIV. (288–346) That night Alberich steals hundreds of small boats from the harbour and the army uses these to land. At dawn, the alarm is given in the city and fierce fighting ensues. Alberich notices that all the city gates are open and the heathens may escape and burn the ships. Leaving Ilyas to continue the main battle, Ortnit gives chase. Returning, successful, he find that Ilyas has lost all his men, and he re-engages to avenge their deaths. With the battle over, Ilyas is shown a cellar where the remaining heathen warriors are hiding and he beheads all of them in revenge, but Ortnit prevents him from killing the woman and children. Attending to the wounded, Ortnit laments the many men he has lost.\n\nV. (347–483) At dawn, they set off for Muntabur. On arrival they pitch their tents outside the castle, but are too close and are shot at from the ramparts. That night, however, Alberich steals into the castle and throws the bows and arrows into the moat. Believing this to be the work of the devil, the heathens pressure the queen to let Ortnit have her daughter. But the king rejects the suggestion angrily. The next day, battle is joined. Distressed at the battle and the danger to her father's life, the princess prays to Apollo and Mohammed. Alberich pretends to be a messenger from (the Christian) God but even so cannot persuade the girl to marry Ortnit, until she challenges him to prove he is stronger than her gods, whereupon he shatters her shrine and throws it into the moat. The princess relents in order to spare her father, and sends her ring to Ortnit. Battle ceases and the heathens withdraw into the castle. Alberich sneaks in and brings out the princess to Ortnit, who rides off with her. As soon as her father discovers she is missing he rides in pursuit of Ortnit with his army. In the ensuing battle, the heathen army is completely destroyed, though Machorel escapes to the safety of the castle. Ortnit sets sail and, after the princess has been baptized, they marry.\n\nVI. (484–526) Machorel is visited by a huntsman, who has stolen two eggs from a dragon's cave and offers to take them to Lombardy to hatch so that they can then devastate Ortnit's land. Machorel agrees and sends the huntsman to Lombardy with gifts. Ortnit and his wife are delighted at these signs of reconciliation. After he has shown these to Ortnit, the huntsman reveals that one gift, an elephant, must be left to grow before being given. Ortnit orders the huntsman to be shown to a suitable cave in the mountains and given provisions. As the dragons grow the provisions start to become inadequate and dragons start to devastate the land in their search for food. After a year, in which knights have failed to defeat the dragons, Ortnit decides that he must take on the task himself.\n\nVII. (527–575) During an emotional parting from his wife, who tries to dissuade him, Ortnit tells her that if he fails to return, the knight who comes back with his armour, his ring and the dragon's tongue, will have avenged his death. Alberich refuses to accompany Ortnit, but warns him not to fall asleep. After a day and night wandering at random without finding the dragon, he sits down to rest but is overcome by sleep. When the dragon approaches, Ortnit's hound attempts to wake him, but without success. The dragon gulps him down whole, and, returning to its lair, feeds him to its young, who suck Ortnit out through his armour.\n\nVIII. (576–597) The hound returns to court, and the queen eventually realises that Ortnit is not following it and must be dead. This is confirmed when a vassal follows the hound to where Ortnit was killed. For two years the queen mourns and, is spite of the urging of the court, refuses to remarry unless it's to the knight who avenges Ortnit. For her refusal she is deprived of her wealth and imprisoned in a tower. The margrave takes pity on her and offers to avenge Ortnit, but only once he has a grown son to be his heir. Meanwhile, he sends food and wine to her in the tower. The story concludes with the remark that we will have to wait a long time for the dragon to be killed, as the killer has not yet been born, he who will later be the grandfather of Dietrich of Verona.\n\nThis version follows that of \"Ortnit A\" up to the point where the dragons are terrorising the country, at which point it concludes. It is followed in the manuscript and prints with the story of Hugdietrich's bride quest, which then leads into the story of Wolfdietrich, which, in this version, includes Ortnit's pursuit of the dragon and his death.\n\nAfter telling of Wolfdietrich's youth, the story introduces the emperor Ortnit, who is told by one of his courtiers of Hugdietrich, King of Greece, and his three sons, who do no fealty to Ortnit. Ortnit sends twelve counts to Hugdietrich to demand tribute. Although the sons threaten to resist violently any claim for tribute, Hugdietrich, in order to save lives, pays in gold. However, Wolfdietrich warns that when he is full grown he will challenge Ortnit.\n\nAfter Wolfdietrich has married Sigeminne, he decides to follow up his earlier threat to challenge Ortnit. He defeats Ortnit in battle, the two are then reconciled. When Sigeminne is abducted, Ortnit offers to help and they succeed in rescuing her.\n\nOrtnit returns home to find his land being terrorised by two dragons and two giants, Velle and his wife Runze. After killing the giants, he sets out to kill the dragons, but after he has killed the first with the help of an elephant, he mysteriously falls asleep. He wakes up to find himself being carried off by the dragon, and in spite of his attempts to resist he is smashed against a tree and killed.\n\nWhile the earliest manuscripts of \"Ortnit\" date from the 14th century, the language of the poem suggests composition around 1230 in an Upper German dialect. The name Machorel and the castle of Muntabur seem to be borrowed from the campaign of 1217 in the Fifth Crusade against Sultan al-Malek al-Adel and his fortress at Mount Tabor.\n\nAttempts to derive the story or the figure of Ortnit from Germanic myth or historical personages have not been successful.\nThe many German bride-quest stories, which include \"Ortnit\", König Rother, Orendel and Salman und Morolf, have their roots in late Merovingian history: chronicles contain a number of self-contained bride-quest stories, based ultimately on the Frankish King Clovis I's wooing of Clotilde in 472. All involve a hero travelling to a foreign country to win a bride.\n\nThe name Ortnit is cognate with the name Hertnið shared by five different characters in the Þiðreks saga, one of whom is defeated in a battle against a dragon. This suggests a variety of possibly unconnected Ortnit/Hertnið stories were circulating in Northern Germany. The figure of Ortnit's uncle, Ilias, is thought to be derived from the Russian folk hero Ilya Muromets. Northern Germany is the obvious location for the integration of such a character into an Ortnit story.\n\nA parallel with the chanson de geste Huon de Bordeaux has also been noted: in \"Huon\" the hero is aided by Auberon, a dwarf with supernatural powers, whose name is cognate with \"Alberich\".\n\nTaken together, all these suggest a geographical origin in Northwest Germany, but the story seems to have been constructed from a variety of elements, not simply retelling an \"Ortnit-saga\". It is unclear whether the bride-quest and dragon-killing stores first became linked in the Northwest or in Southern Germany, though it seems possible that Ortnit's failure to kill the dragon was necessitated only when his story was linked with Wolfdietrich.\n\n\"Ortnit\" and \"Wolfdietrich\" are both written in a strophic form called the \"Hildebrandston\" (similar to the Nibelungenstrophe used in the Nibelungenlied and Kudrun). It consists of four long-lines: each long-line has three feet with a feminine ending, a caesura, then three feet with a rhymed masculine ending.\n\nThe strophes are marked in the manuscripts by a Lombardic capital.\n\nIn the printed Heldenbücher, the \"Hildebrandston\" is transformed into the \"Heunenweise\", an eight-line strophe: the long-line is split at the caesura and unrhymed line-endings are given rhymes, with the resulting rhyme scheme ABABCDCD . This necessarily involved considerable rewriting of the text:\n\n\n"}
