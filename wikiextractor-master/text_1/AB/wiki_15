{"id": "1933080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933080", "title": "Viktor Ullmann", "text": "Viktor Ullmann\n\nViktor Ullmann (1 January 1898, in Teschen – 18 October 1944, in KZ Auschwitz-Birkenau) was a Silesia-born Austrian composer, conductor and pianist.\n\nViktor Ullmann was born on 1 January 1898 in Těšín (Teschen), modern Český Těšín / Cieszyn. It belonged then to Silesia in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and is now divided between Cieszyn in Poland and Český Těšín in The Czech Republic. Both his parents were from families of Jewish descent, but had converted to Roman Catholicism before Viktor's birth. As an assimilated Jew, his father, Maximilian, was able to pursue a career as a professional officer in the army of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In World War I he was promoted to colonel and ennobled.\n\nOne writer has described Ullman's milieu in these terms: \"Like such other assimilated German-speaking Czech Jews as Kafka and Mahler, Ullmann lived a life of multiple estrangements, cut off from Czech nationalism, German anti-Semitism and Jewish orthodoxy\".\n\nBeginning in 1909 Viktor attended a grammar school (\"Gymnasium\") in Vienna. His musical talents and inclinations soon gave him access to Arnold Schönberg and his circle of pupils. Upon finishing school, he volunteered for military service.\n\nAfter deployment on the Italian Front at Isonzo , he was granted study leave, which he used to start studying law at Vienna University. There he also attended the lectures of Wilhelm Jerusalem. At the beginning of 1918 he was accepted in Schönberg's composition seminar. With Schönberg he studied the theory of form, counterpoint and orchestration. Ullmann was an excellent pianist, although he had no ambitions for a career as a soloist.\n\nIn May 1919, he broke off both courses of study and left Vienna in order to devote himself fully to music in Prague. His mentor was now Alexander von Zemlinsky, under whose direction he served as a conductor at the New German Theatre of Prague (now the Prague State Opera) until 1927. In the following season, 1927–28, he was appointed head of the opera company in Aussig an der Elbe (Ústí nad Labem), but his repertoire, including operas by Richard Strauss, Krenek and others, was too advanced for local tastes, and his appointment was terminated.\n\nIn 1923 with the \"Sieben Lieder mit Klavier\" (\"7 Songs with Piano\") he witnessed a series of successful performances of his works, which lasted until the beginning of the 1930s (\"Sieben Serenaden\"). At the Geneva music festival of the International Society for New Music in 1929, his \"Schönberg Variations\", a piano cycle on a theme by his teacher in Vienna, caused something of a stir. Five years later, for the orchestral arrangement of this work, he was awarded the , named in honor of the former director of Universal Editions. In the meantime he had been appointed conductor in Zürich for two years. As a result of his interest in anthroposophy, a movement founded by Rudolf Steiner, he spent another two years as a bookseller in Stuttgart, but was forced to flee Germany in mid-1933 and returned to Prague as a music teacher and journalist.\n\nDuring this period he worked with the department of music at Czechoslovak Radio, wrote book and music reviews for various magazines, wrote as a critic for the \"Bohemia\" newspaper, lectured to educational groups, gave private lessons, and was actively involved in the program of the Czechoslovak Society for Music Education. At about this time Ullmann made friends with the composer Alois Hába, whom he had known for some time. Ullmann enrolled in Hába's department of quarter tone music at the Prague Conservatory, where he studied from 1935 to 1937.\n\nWhile his works of the 1920s still clearly show the influence of Schönberg's atonal period, especially the Chamber Symphony Op. 9, the George Songs Op. 15 and \"Pierrot Lunaire\", Op. 21, Ullmann's compositions from 1935 onwards, like the String Quartet No. 2 and Piano Sonata No. 1, are distinguished by his independent development of Schönberg's inspirations. Similarly the opera \"Fall of the Antichrist\" develops the issues raised by Alban Berg's opera \"Wozzeck\". Dissonant harmonics, highly charged musical expression, and masterly control of formal structure are characteristic of Ullmann's new and henceforth unmistakable personal style.\n\nOn 8 September 1942 he was deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. Up to his deportation his list of works had reached 41 opus numbers and contained an additional three piano sonatas, song cycles on texts by various poets, operas, and the piano concerto Op. 25, which he finished in December 1939, nine months after the entry of German troops into Prague. Most of these works are missing. The manuscripts presumably disappeared during the occupation. Thirteen printed items, which Ullmann published privately and entrusted to a friend for safekeeping, have survived.\n\nThe particular nature of the camp at Theresienstadt enabled Ullmann to remain active musically: he was a piano accompanist, organized concerts (\"Collegium musicum\", \"Studio for New Music\"), wrote critiques of musical events, and composed, as part of a cultural circle including Karel Ančerl, Rafael Schachter, Gideon Klein, Hans Krása, and other prominent musicians imprisoned there. He wrote: \"By no means did we sit weeping on the banks of the waters of Babylon. Our endeavor with respect to arts was commensurate with our will to live.\"\n\nOn 16 October 1944 he was deported to the camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where on 18 October 1944 he was killed in the gas chambers.\n\nThe work he completed in Theresienstadt was mostly preserved and comprises, in addition to choral works, song cycles and a quantity of stage music, such significant works as the last three piano sonatas, the Third String Quartet, the melodrama based on Rilke's \"Cornet\" poem, and the chamber opera \"The Emperor of Atlantis, or The Disobedience of Death\", with a libretto by Peter Kien. Its premiere was planned for Theresienstadt in the autumn of 1944, conducted by Rafael Schachter, but it is believed that the SS commander noticed similarities between the Emperor of Atlantis and Adolf Hitler and suppressed it. In fact, there is no evidence for this view. And therefore the eye-witness Herbert Thomas Mandl proves the proof, \"that the Emperor is not Hitler\". The opera was first performed in Amsterdam in 1975 in a version of the conductor Kerry Woodward. It has been broadcast by BBC television in Britain, and there have been productions in several countries. Important productions took place in Bremen and Stuttgart in 1990; American premieres took place in San Francisco in 1975 and in Brooklyn in 1977. Other works include the song-cycle \"Man and his Day\" to poems by Ullmann's friend, the poet and later historian of Theresienstadt, H. G. Adler.\n\nSince 1993 it is possible to perform the original version of the opera with the help of Karel Berman, based on his Terezin rolebook and the musicologist Ingo Schultz. This reconstructed original version of the original score has been used for the production of the opera done by the director Herbert Gantschacher for ARBOS - Company for Music and Theatre. This production used also Ullmann's original title \"The Emperor of Atlantis or The Disobedience of Death\" and has been recorded by the Prague label STUDIO MATOUS in 1994/1995. This production of the opera by Herbert Gantschacher has been performed for the first time at Terezin on 23 May 1995. From these first performances at Terezin ever a live recording exists done by ARBOS – Company for Music and Theatre. In all, Ullmann worked on the opera for 27 years, from the first impressions in the First World War in 1917 to the finalization at Terezin in 1944.\n\nThe most concrete formulation of this discourse occurs in the \"Emperor of Atlantis\", with the parable of the Emperor's game with Death for Life. The \"game\", which concerns the Emperor's plan for the total destruction of all human life, ends with the ruin of the Emperor and with the vision of a new understanding between life and death.\n\nWhen Ullmann was deported to Auschwitz, he left his works in the safekeeping of the philosopher Emil Utitz. After the war, Utitz gave them to H. G. Adler in Theresienstadt in 1945, and Adler brought the scores to England in 1947.\n\n\nIn the middle of 1942, shortly before his deportation to Theresienstadt concentration camp, Ullmann drew up a comprehensive list of his compositions to that point. This list was preserved in a London library as part of a letter to a correspondent whom it has not hitherto been possible to identify. In contrast to earlier lists of works, the London list is distinguished by an unbroken sequence of opus numbers (1–41) and the unmistakable incorporation of works or titles already known. Ullmann's list of works is of incalculable value in light of the lost or missing compositions, although it makes clear the full extent of the loss caused by persecution and war.\n\nIn the following summary Ullmann's opus numbering has been used, and extended for the opus numbers given to works composed in Theresienstadt. The order of titles is essentially chronological and takes account both of compositions known from earlier lists of works as well as of those bibliographically recorded. Uncertain dating is indicated by (?). Traces of an earlier numeration derive from the list of works from the 1920s (\"Riemann Musiklexikon\" 11/1929). These references occur only in connection with the \"Schönberg Variations\", which in relation to the opus numeration and to the chronology cut across the principle of arrangement used.\n\n\n\n"}

This is also referred to as increase in the capital intensity. Capital deepening is often measured by the rate of change in capital stock per labour hour. Overall, the economy will expand, and productivity per worker will increase. However, according to some economic models, such as the Solow model, economic expansion will not continue indefinitely through capital deepening alone. This is partly due to diminishing returns and wear & tear (depreciation). Investment is also required to increase the amount of capital available to each worker in the system and thus increase the ratio of capital to labour. In other economic models, for example, the AK model or some models in endogenous growth theory, capital deepening can lead to sustained economic growth even without technological progress. Traditionally, in development economics, capital deepening is seen as a necessary but not sufficient condition for economic development of a country.\n\nCapital widening is the situation where the stock of capital is increasing at the same rate as the labour force and the depreciation rate, thus the capital per worker ratio remains constant. The economy will expand in terms of aggregate output, \"but\" productivity per worker will remain constant.\n\n"}

He was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland, Chancellor of the University of Queensland, and the 21st Governor of Queensland from 1985 to 1992.\n\nCampbell was born in Burringbar, northern New South Wales, to Archie Eric Gordon Campbell and Leila Mary, née Murphy. Archie Campbell was a decorated soldier of the First World War, having won the Military Cross for gallantry in action against the Ottoman Turks in Gaza and the Distinguished Service Order for later efforts in Damascus. Leila Campbell died unexpectedly, leaving Walter and his brothers to spend a considerable amount of time with their mother's parents in northern New South Wales.\n\nThe death of his mother had interrupted his early education at a Christian Brothers' convent in Toowoomba and led to Campbell continuing his studies at a college in Lismore, New South Wales. Campbell completed his education at Downlands College, Toowoomba, becoming the college's first Open Scholar in the late 1930s, having already been named dux of the college twice and earning the highest grade in Queensland for Senior Latin.\n\nCampbell attended the University of Queensland from 1940, and served as editor of the student paper \"Semper Floreat\" during his first year. He interrupted his studies in 1941 to take up service in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), during the Second World War. He passed his pilot's examination at RAAF Base Amberley on 7 December 1941 and was assigned to the 67th Reserve Squadron of the RAAF, which patrolled Australia's eastern coast. He became a flight instructor and was based in Tasmania, badly injuring his knee in a biplane crash. After his recovery, the RAAF put Campbell in command of a Liberator Base in the Darling Downs.\n\nCampbell was discharged from the RAAF with the rank of flight lieutenant on 13 February 1946, and returned to his studies. He became President of the University of Queensland Union, and graduated in 1948 with first class honours in Law, having already gained a Master of Arts the previous year.\n\nCampbell was admitted to the Bar in 1948 and became a Queen's Counsel in 1960. His practice took him as high in the legal world as the Privy Council in London, before which he appeared on several occasions. He became a member of the Law Faculty Board at the University of Queensland in 1954. Campbell himself recalled that when he entered the legal profession \"there were only about seventy barristers in private practice in Queensland\", contrasting this number with the increase that had taken place by the time he was Governor of Queensland. In 1965, Campbell became President of the Queensland Association, holding this position simultaneously with the presidency of the national equivalent from 1966 to 1967. Campbell represented Joh Bjelke-Petersen in a failed High Court appeal against the Australian Taxation Office in 1959.\n\nIn 1967, Campbell gained a position on the bench of the Supreme Court of Queensland. In the late 1960s and early 1970s Campbell would meet with other Justices in Canberra when they had been summoned to various board and committee meetings and discuss various issues facing the judiciary ranging from problems with sentencing to the difficulty of persuading eminent lawyers to enter the judiciary. The issue of lawyers being unwilling to move from the Bar to the Bench remained a concern to Campbell even after he had left the judiciary and become governor.\n\nIn 1982, the incumbent Chief and Puisne Justices of Queensland were scheduled to retire, having reached the mandatory age of 70. Campbell became the centre of a controversy, as he was chosen to fill the Chief Justiceship instead of Jim Douglas, the favoured candidate of the Liberal Party. Joh Bjelke-Petersen admitted to choosing Campbell as a \"compromise candidate\" to Justice Douglas and his own preferred Chief Justice, Dormer Andrews. The retiring Chief Justice declared that he had nothing against Campbell personally, but that he found the treatment of Douglas \"unjust and unsatisfactory\".\nCampbell emerged largely unscathed from the controversy, but did clash at times with the Bjelke-Petersen government as Chief Justice, criticising the legal integrity of certain legislation when he found it necessary. He was also noted as having contributed significantly to the modernisation of the Court in Queensland during his time as Chief Justice.\n\nHaving been a member of the University of Queensland Senate since 1963, Campbell was well established within the activities of the University. In 1977 he became Chancellor of the university, holding the position for nine years until 1985. As chancellor, Campbell criticised the method of admitting people into tertiary student positions, claiming some reform was needed. There was also controversy in this period when the government forced the university publishers to withdraw the second volume of Ross Fitzgerald's \"History of Queensland\", and the university awarded an honorary doctorate of law to Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen.\n\nCampbell succeeded Sir James Ramsay as Governor of Queensland on 22 July 1985. There has been some conjecture that the Bjelke-Petersen government may have elevated Campbell to this position to remove him from the Chief Justiceship. All of the controversies surrounding Campbell appear to be merely projections of the very controversies affecting Joh Bjelke-Petersen and his government, with Campbell's inauguration as governor attracting complaint from the Queensland Trades and Labour Council that they had been ostracised from the swearing-in ceremony due to political manoeuvring by the State Government.\n\nThis tradition of controversy involving Campbell and the government came to crisis in 1987 when there was internal strife within the National Party between Bjelke-Petersen and his cabinet, which almost caused a constitutional crisis in Queensland governance. There had already been murmurs in early 1987 of a vice-regal intervention in Queensland politics when \"The Australian\" newspaper in March featured a front-page article detailing State Opposition leader Nev Warburton's call for Campbell to sack Bjelke-Petersen over allegations of illegal conduct by the government. These suggestions came to nothing. However, later in the year when Bjelke-Petersen lost the confidence of his cabinet, the question was again raised as to what role Campbell as governor would play in the event of a constitutional crisis.\n\nOn 23 November 1987, Bjelke-Petersen visited Campbell at Government House, Brisbane to discuss a restructuring of his ministry. It was Bjelke-Petersen's wish to dissolve his entire ministry and be recommissioned as premier with a new distribution of ministerial portfolios, however Campbell's advice was for the premier to seek the individual resignations of those ministers he wanted removed from the ministry. After having approached five ministers about resigning from their offices and being refused by each one, the premier returned to Campbell on 24 November and requested the termination of the commissions of three of the five ministers. He also advised Campbell to dissolve the legislature and call a fresh election. Campbell balked at calling a new election for a legislature barely a year old, but did agree to the removal of the three ministers.\n\nWhile the government's problems were already serious, the difficulty for Campbell really began on 26 November. That day, a spill motion carried in the National party room. Bjelke-Petersen had not anticipated this party-room coup and did not even attend the meeting. He thus did not nominate for the ensuing leadership ballot, which was won by one of the dismissed ministers, Mike Ahern. In accordance with normal convention, Ahern wrote to Campbell seeking to be commissioned as premier in place of Bjelke-Petersen. This should have been a pro forma request, since the Nationals had a majority in their own right. However, Bjelke-Petersen touched off a constitutional crisis when he refused to resign his commission. Campbell refused to use his reserve power to terminate it after receiving legal advice that he should only dismiss Bjelke-Petersen and commission Ahern if Bjelke-Petersen lost a vote of no confidence. There were also fears that Bjelke-Petersen might advise Campbell to dissolve parliament and call elections. Some sections of the press attacked Campbell for his apparent inactivity during the crisis, while other voices within the legal and political world supported his course of action. As the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" had described this tense situation, Queensland now had a \"Premier who is not leader\" and the National Party a \"Leader who is not Premier\". The crisis only ended when Bjelke-Petersen retired from politics on 1 December. Campbell was later praised by many in the media for his handling of the situation.\n\nIn March 1988, Campbell gave a lecture on \"The Role of a State Governor\" to the Royal Australian Institute of Public Administration, Queensland Division, in which he described the various functions carried out by state governors, the legal and constitutional framework of the office and numerous historical accounts of different situations involving vice-regal figures in Queensland and other Commonwealth domains.\n\nAfter seven years as governor, Campbell retired in July 1992. He did not retire quietly, continuing to speak at various functions and publicly opposing Paul Keating's push for an Australian republic in 1993 by writing to the British newspaper \"The Daily Telegraph\". He continued his advocacy for the monarchy later that year when launching the second volume of \"Upholding the Australian Constitution\", stating, \"republicanism I think is being used by certain people as a pretext or as a blind or a screen to conceal a deeper purpose or purposes\".\n\nCampbell married Georgina Pearce in 1942, and fathered three children, Deborah, Peter and Wallace Campbell. He resided with his family in Clayfield, Brisbane while a member of the Supreme Court judiciary and retired to Ascot after leaving Government House. He died at age 83, at his home on 4 September 2004 after a short period of illness, and was cremated at the Mt Thompson Crematorium.\n\nCampbell was appointed a Knight Bachelor in 1979, and a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1989. On 1 January 2001, he was awarded the Centenary Medal.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1933111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933111", "title": "Straight-acting", "text": "Straight-acting\n\nStraight-acting is a term for a same gender-attracted person who does not exhibit the appearance or mannerisms of what is seen as typical for gay people. Although the label is used by and reserved almost exclusively for gay and bisexual men, it may also be used to describe a lesbian or bisexual woman exhibiting a feminine appearance and mannerisms. Because the term invokes negative stereotypes of gay people, its application is often controversial and may cause offense.\n\nCommunication Scholar, Shinsuke Eguchi (2009) proposes to explain the emergence of the straight acting phenomenon \"because some gay men want to achieve hegemonic masculinity to overcome gay effeminate images\". Both Eguchi and Tim Berling relate it to the general context of sissyphobia—the dominant cultural norm that disparages effeminate men, which is not restricted to the gay culture. In \"Negotiating Sisyphobia: A critical/ interpretive analysis of one ‘femme’ gay Asian body in the heteronormative world,\" Shinsuke Eguchi (2011) writes, \"I began to see that the discursive manifestation of sissyphobia is not that feminine gay men are unattractive and undesirable. Rather, these straight-acting gay men would like to present their “heteronormative” masculine faces in their social interactions with others\" (p. 50).\n\nSex advice columnist Dan Savage commented on the popularity of the term \"straight-acting\" in gay personal ads, criticizing both the practice and the idea that a man seeking a gay relationship through a gay personal ad is acting straight. Defenders of the term maintain it refers merely to one's mannerisms and that critics' isolation of the word \"acting\" in the phrase distorts the intended meaning of the phrase. Use of the term itself has been labeled as damaging to the LGBT community, as it associates certain attributes with homosexuality.\n\nMen who use the expression \"straight-acting\" may express resentment that critics claim the term implies they are acting and not being their true selves.\n\nQueers United Against Straight Acting Homosexuals (QUASH) was the organization in Chicago that published an often cited article in their newsletter in 1993. Titled; \"Assimilation is Killing Us Fight For a Queer United Front.\" The article calls for a new order in our gendered social systems to be inclusive and not exclude anyone from liberation, challenging the power and privilege of the dominant members of society. An article similar to \"Assimilation is Killing Us\", published a year later, entitled, QUASH, still standing for Queers United Against Straight-Acting Homosexuals, used the same concept of rejection of the established gendered protocols, specifically, that there can be varied and better institutions than couple hood and marriage.\nThese were early challenges to heteronormativity; ways of thinking outside the dominant culture's definitions of gender.\n\n\n"}

He later played with success for Leicestershire.\n\nCricket writer, Colin Bateman, noted, \"Higgs was a fine medium-fast bowler with an impressive pedigree, who suddenly went out of fashion with the selectors after one Test of the 1968 Ashes series\".\n\nIn his junior days concentrating on football with Port Vale, Higgs did not take seriously to cricket until his late teens. He was signed to the club from July 1954 to 1959, but never made a first team appearance. Making progress during military service, he began playing for his native county, Staffordshire, taking 46 wickets for 13.13 each in 1957. Jack Ikin, a Staffordshire native, recommended Higgs to Lancashire and he began playing for them in 1958.\n\nHiggs caused instant notice taking 7 for 36 against Hampshire in his first County Championship match. He took over 100 wickets in each season from 1959 to 1960, but was one of the few cricketers to take 100 wickets in a season at over thirty runs each in 1961, and he ceased to be an automatic choice.\n\nIn 1965, a wet summer, he took 102 wickets in County Championship matches, and formed a formidable partnership with Statham. His best performance was 7 for 19 against Leicestershire. He was selected for the last Test at The Oval and took 8 for 143 against a formidable South African batting line-up, and was selected for MCC tour of Australia in 1965-66, where he had a modest time, but took 17 wickets (9.24) in three Tests in New Zealand.\n\nIn 1966, against the West Indies, Higgs established himself as England's first-choice opening bowler with 24 wickets for under 26 runs. At the Oval Higgs, only a tail-end left-hand batsman, made 63, then his highest first-class score and helped England effect a recovery from 166 for 7 to 529 all out. His partnership with John Snow for the tenth wicket of 128, is a record for England at home. It also remains as the all-time Test match record partnership between batsmen 10 and 11.\n\nDespite injury keeping out of two Tests against India, Higgs had a good season in 1967, taking 95 wickets at 16.92. He was named one of Cricketers of the Year by \"Wisden\". In that year, he took 17 wickets in the Test series against Pakistan. Despite this, he did not play in England's next Test series, their tour to the West Indies. He was later selected for one match of the Ashes series the following year, but was never selected again. According to the cricket writer Peter Mason, Higgs \"was entitled to wonder why he had not been picked more often for his country\". Higgs retired from County cricket at the end of the 1969 season, and played for Rishton in the Lancashire League. In the twelve seasons for Lancashire Higgs took 1,033 wickets, a figure which had then been exceeded by only eight players.\n\nAfter two years in the Lancashire League, the Leicestershire captain, Ray Illingworth called Higgs out of first-class cricket retirement because of Graham McKenzie's expected unavailability with the 1972 Australians. Higgs played regularly until the end of the 1979 season, for which he was appointed captain. He was the fifth-highest Englishman in the bowling averages that season at the age of forty-two. In one-day cricket, Higgs played in Leicestershire's 1972 and 1975 successes in the Benson & Hedges Cup, also taking a hat-trick in the unsuccessful 1974 final. He was also part of Leicestershire's County Championship-winning side in 1975. All together, Higgs took 308 List 'A' wickets for his adopted county. He was also, on his day, a solid and reliable tail-end batsman, who scored over 300 runs in a season six times. His highest first-class score of 98 was part of Leicestershire's record 228 run last wicket partnership with Ray Illingworth against Northamptonshire in 1977.\n\nAfter 1979, Higgs seldom played in first-class cricket, and he retired from one-day cricket after 1982. In 1986, he returned at the age of 49, taking 5 for 22 against Yorkshire. He played once more, against Somerset, without taking a wicket. In all he took 100 wickets in a season five times, and over 90 twice. He took 42 List A wickets in both 1975 and 1977.\n\nHiggs later coached both Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire. He also umpired several Second XI fixtures.\n\n"}

For 30 miles from Crossdoney in County Cavan to Enniskillen in County Fermanagh, it is difficult to distinguish the river as it winds its way through interconnected loughs or parts of loughs nestling among the drumlin hills of Cavan and south Fermanagh. The river is 120 kilometres long and is used for fly fishing for trout and salmon, with a number of fisheries along both the river itself and its tributaries. The town of Enniskillen is mostly situated on an island in the river, between Upper and Lower Lough Erne. It is linked to the River Shannon by the Shannon–Erne Waterway.\n\nThe total catchment area of the River Erne is 4,372 km.\nThe long-term average rate of the River Erne is 101.7 cubic metres per second (m/s)\n\nThe river takes its name from a mythical princess named \"Éirne\".\n\nThe building of hydroelectric power stations at Cliff (near Belleek) and Ballyshannon (work began in 1945 and the first power station was commissioned in 1950) caused local salmon beats to be flooded. The run of salmon into the Erne has now declined to a level that is of little angling value, except for the few fish that are occasionally caught below Cliff when the power station is generating. Roach first appeared in the river in 1963, and there was an increase in the roach population in 1968. This increase could well have had an adverse effect on trout stocks, which went into decline at that time. Water pollution became a problem in the 1970s and up to 1987. Since 1987 the pollution problem has been controlled, the roach population has also declined and trout stocks have made a return and provide good angling once more, both on the Erne itself and its tributaries.\n\nLive aboard pleasure cruisers are available in several locations along the Erne waterway, including Belturbet, Knockniny, Carrybridge, Bellanaleck, Enniskillen, and Killadeas. In addition to the use of the Erne for live aboard boating holidays, sections of the river are used for water skiing, bank fishing, trolling, jet skiing and scuba diving. Boaters are cautioned, by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, that Upper Lough Erne is a maze of small islands needing careful navigation, and waves on Lower Lough Erne can reach \"open-sea dimensions\".\n\nThe Erne waterway is home to ancient ruins, both Christian and Pagan, with ruins found in several locations, including: Crom Estate, on the North bank of the Upper Erne channel, Gad Island, near Crom Estate, Devenish Island, Inismacsaint Island, Davy’s Island, White Island, and Boa Island. Many of these locations can only be reached by boat.\n\nDevenish Island has a historical display centre adjacent to its ruins. Visitors sometimes use rental boats and the Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland Activity Map of Lough Erne () to locate these ancient sites.\n\nThe song \"Buachaill Ón Éirne\" is an Irish ballad about a young boy from the Erne area. It has been recorded by such groups as Clannad and The Corrs.\n\nA number of places were once accessible by train along the River Erne, with the once extensive Great Northern Railway and the Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway both serving the area.\n\n"}

{"id": "1933141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933141", "title": "Imber", "text": "Imber\n\nImber is an uninhabited village in part of the British Army's training grounds on the Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire, England. It is situated in an isolated area of the Plain, about west of the A360 road between Tilshead and West Lavington. The entire civilian population was evicted in 1943 to provide an exercise area for American troops preparing for the invasion of Europe during the Second World War.\n\nAfter the war, villagers were not allowed to return to their homes. The village, which is now part of the civil parish of Heytesbury, remains under the control of the Ministry of Defence despite several attempts by former residents to return. Non-military access is limited to several open days a year.\n\nSettlement in the area began before the period of Roman rule, in the British Iron Age or earlier. Several ancient trackways lead to and from the village. The first documentary evidence of Imber's existence comes from Saxon times, with a mention of the village in 967. Imber is also recorded in the Domesday Book, at which time it is believed to have had a population of around fifty. The village's church of St Giles dates from the 13th century and has notable wall-paintings from the 15th. By the 14th century the population of the village had risen to around 250, where it is believed to have remained until the 19th century. Population peaked at 440 as recorded in the census of 1851, declining to around 150 by the time of Imber's abandonment.\n\nImber was always an isolated community, Salisbury Plain being relatively sparsely populated, and most of its residents were employed in agriculture or work that directly depended on it. The village had an elongated form like a linear village, and its main street followed the course of a stream known as Imber Dock. The only building to survive in a reasonable condition is the church; the rest became derelict or were demolished by the Army. In 1943 there was also a Baptist chapel (built in 1839, demolished in late 1970s), a post office, and a pub called the \"Bell Inn\", which still stands; as does the manor house, Imber Court. Also still standing are a farmhouse, farm cottages, schoolroom and four \"council house\" type blocks built in 1938.\n\nIn the late 19th century the War Office began buying land on Salisbury Plain, primarily to the east of Imber, and using it for manœuvres. Beginning in the late 1920s farms around Imber were bought, as well as the land on which the village sat. The pressures of agricultural depression, combined with the good prices offered by the military, encouraged the sale of land, with few being put off by the new conditions of their tenancy. This allowed the War Office to assume control and evict the residents if necessary. By the time of the Second World War, almost all of the land in and around Imber, except the church, vicarage, chapel, schoolroom and \"Bell Inn\", belonged to the War Office.\n\nOn 1 November 1943, with preparations for the Allied invasion of mainland Europe under way, the people of Imber were called to a meeting in the village schoolroom and given 47 days' notice to leave their homes. Imber was to be used by US forces to practise street fighting. Richard Madigan's evidence to the Defence Lands Committee (DLC) stated that street fighting practice never took place and that his, and others', duties were to keep the village in good repair for the villagers' eventual return. The reason for eviction was the village's proximity to shell impact areas. \n\nAlthough upset about being forced to leave, most villagers put up no resistance, even leaving canned provisions in their kitchens and taking the view that it was their duty to contribute to the war effort in this way – making sacrifices on the Home Front for the greater good. Compensation for the move was limited, and the occupants of one farm had to be forcibly evicted by the Army. Albert Nash, who had been the village's blacksmith for over forty years, is said to have been found sobbing over his anvil and later became the first resident to die and be brought back to Imber for burial. It was said that he died of a broken heart after being forced to leave the village.\n\nAfter the war the village was used extensively for training, particularly preparing soldiers for their duties in the urban environments of Northern Ireland. Several empty house-like buildings were constructed during the 1970s to aid training, and it is these, along with the church, Bell Inn and Imber Court, that are Imber's most striking buildings today. Although training continues at Imber, a purpose-built urban warfare complex for close quarters battle at Copehill Down (approx 3 miles SE) has recently been the focus of this type of training, as that site is easier to adapt to reflect the areas in which troops are likely to be deployed.\n\nMany of the village's buildings suffered shell and explosion damage after the war when UK military operations began, and, additionally eroded by the weather, quickly fell into disrepair. Although the villagers had been told they could return in six months, this was never allowed. Documentary evidence of a return agreement only came to light at the Defence Land Committee hearings. At the end of the war, efforts were made to restore Imber to its pre-war condition – although there was very little damage – but the decision was taken not to relinquish control.\n\nA rally in the village was organised in 1961 to demand that the villagers be allowed to move back, and over 2,000 people attended, including many former residents. A public inquiry was held, and found in favour of Imber's continued military use.\n\nThe matter was also raised in the House of Lords, and it was decided that the church would be maintained, and would be open for worship on the Saturday closest to St Giles's day each year, a practice that continues.\n\nA further attempt to restore Imber took place in the early 1970s when the Defence Lands Committee (DLC) was given the task of looking into the need for the retention of MoD lands. The Imber case was represented before the DLC by David J Johnson, an Imber researcher; Richard Madigan, a former soldier who helped to evacuate the village — and testified to the promise of return after the war — and Rex Mutters, a wartime fighter pilot. They were assisted by Austin Underwood, who had led the campaign in the early 1960s and backed-up with written evidence from former villagers. In spite of all the additional evidence, including the first re-appearance since 1943 of the original eviction letter (which indicated return), the DLC recommended that the village be retained for military use.\n\nThe annual church service, on the Saturday nearest to 1 September (St Giles' Day), has been attended by former residents including Ken Mitchell (grandson of Albert Nash); the son of the last schoolmistress, John Williams; soldiers who have used the village for training, and the general public. The village is open to visitors on other occasions; generally these are certain Bank Holidays and around Christmas. From 2009 to 2018 there has been a Carol service on the Saturday before Christmas.\n\nSince 2009, the annual summer opening of the village has been served by preserved and new double-decker buses, many originally from London. These operate to a scheduled public timetable, not as excursions, and the village appears as a destination on the bus stop at Warminster railway station.\n\nUnlike the rest of the parish, St Giles' church and its graveyard remained in the hands of the Diocese of Salisbury, although access was and is controlled by the Ministry of Defence. The Bell Inn was sold to the MoD in the mid-1950s and the Baptist Chapel in the late 1970s. The civil parish of Imber was eventually incorporated into neighbouring Heytesbury, to the south, while for Church of England purposes the ecclesiastical parish of Imber was incorporated into the parish of Edington, to the north. This combined ecclesiastical parish of Edington with Imber was responsible for another ancient listed church, Edington Priory, as well as St Giles'.\n\nThe church was recorded as Grade I listed in 1987.\n\nBy 2001 it had become clear, according to a Church of England press release, that St Giles's \"was in need of extensive repairs\". Since it was \"not possible for the parochial church council to accept liability for the maintenance of a building to which they only had effective access for worship once a year\", the Edington with Imber PCC requested that Imber church be declared redundant, setting in train a process which ended in 2005 with the vesting of the church in the Churches Conservation Trust. In the meantime, the church tower had been struck by lightning in 2003, weakening the structure, but restoration work began in 2008 and the annual service resumed in September 2009 on completion of the works.\n\nImber is still included in the census records for England. The population reached its peak of 440 in 1851 which had declined to 152 by 1931 when the last occupied census was taken. The next census after 1931 was in 1951 when the number of residents was listed as \"0\", a situation which continues to be shown on census results.\n\nThe civil parish of Imber has been incorporated into the adjoining parish of Heytesbury. A parish council known as \"Heytesbury, Imber and Knook\" covers this parish and the neighbouring parish of Knook. Although it has no electors, Imber is represented in parliament by the member for South West Wiltshire, Andrew Murrison; and on Wiltshire Council by Christopher Newbury.\n\nWith the exception of St Giles' church, the whole of the former parish is owned by the Ministry of Defence and is administered as part of its Salisbury Plain Training Area.\n\nImber features in the 1965 movie \"Catch Us If You Can\", the debut feature film of director John Boorman and a starring vehicle for the British pop group The Dave Clark Five.\n\nIn Victor Canning's 1972 novel for teenagers \"The Runaways\", the cheetah that has escaped from Longleat Safari Park makes a den on the firing range close to Imber and her cubs are found there by the young hero Smiler.\n\nThe 2013 novel \"The Sea Change\" by Joanna Rossiter centres on the evacuation of Imber, and the subsequent experiences of fictional characters from the village in the war and post-war years.\n\nNeil Spring's 2017 novel \"The Lost Village\", a ghost story featuring ghost hunter Harry Price, is set in Imber.\n\nImber features in the fourth episode of Michael Portillo's Channel 5 series \"Portillo's Hidden History of Britain\" broadcast 11 May 2018.\n\nMount Vernon Arts Lab recorded the instrumental piece \"Imber\" by Drew Mulholland and this was released on Earworm Subscription Series in 1998 (WORMSS2).\n\nLittle Imber by the Georgian composer Giya Kancheli is a piece for small ensemble, voice, children's and men's choirs. It was performed in the church at Imber in 2003 and the recording released on ECM Records in 2008 (ECM 1812).\n\nThe Norwegian electronic duo Kook recorded an album called \"Imber, Wiltshire\" of seven wordless compositions all with titles taken from the village and its inhabitants. This was released on Va Fongool Records (VAFCD011).\n\nThe Wiltshire folk group The Yirdbards recorded their song \"The Ghosts of Old Imber\" at St Giles' Church in the village in October 2013 and released it on CD in 2014 to raise funds for the church.\n\n\n"}

Epigram's type system is strong enough to express program specifications. The goal is to support a smooth transition from ordinary programming to integrated programs and proofs whose correctness can be checked and certified by the compiler. Epigram exploits the propositions as types principle, and is based on intuitionistic type theory.\n\nThe Epigram prototype was implemented by Conor McBride based on joint work with James McKinna. Its development is continued by the Epigram group in Nottingham, Durham, St Andrews and Royal Holloway in the UK. The current experimental implementation of the Epigram system is freely available together with a user manual, a tutorial and some background material. The system has been used under Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.\n\nIt is currently unmaintained, and version 2, which was intended to implement Observational Type Theory, was never officially released but exists in GitHub. The design of Epigram and Epigram 2 have inspired the development Agda, Idris, and Coq.\n\nEpigram uses a two-dimensional, natural deduction style syntax, with a LaTeX version and an ASCII version. Here are some examples from \"The Epigram Tutorial\":\n\nThe following declaration defines the natural numbers:\n\nThe declaration says that codice_1 is a type with kind codice_2 (i.e., it is a simple type) and two constructors: codice_3 and codice_4. The constructor codice_4 takes a single codice_1 argument and returns a codice_1. This is equivalent to the Haskell declaration \"codice_8\".\n\nIn LaTeX, the code is displayed as:\n\nformula_1\n\nThe horizontal-line notation can be read as \"assuming (what is on the top) is true, we can infer that (what is on the bottom) is true.\" For example, \"assuming codice_9 is of type codice_1, then codice_11 is of type codice_1.\" If nothing is on the top, then the bottom statement is always true: \"codice_3 is of type codice_1 (in all cases).\"\n\nformula_2\n\nformula_3\n\nformula_4\n\n...And in ASCII: \n...And in ASCII:\nEpigram is essentially a typed lambda calculus with generalized algebraic data type extensions, except for two extensions. First, types are first-class entities, of type formula_5; types are arbitrary expressions of type formula_5, and type equivalence is defined in terms of the types' normal forms. Second, it has a dependent function type; instead of formula_7, formula_8, where formula_9 is bound in formula_10 to the value that the function's argument (of type formula_11) eventually takes.\n\nFull dependent types, as implemented in Epigram, are a powerful abstraction. (Unlike in Dependent ML, the value(s) depended upon may be of any valid type.) A sample of the new formal specification capabilities dependent types bring may be found in \"The Epigram Tutorial\".\n\n\n\n"}

Renowned for his social films that reflected the changing middle-class ethos, Mukherjee \"carved a middle path between the extravagance of mainstream cinema and the stark realism of art cinema\".\n\nHe also remained the chairman of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) and of the National Film Development Corporation (NFDC). The Government of India honoured him with the Dada Saheb Phalke Award in 1999 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2001. He received the NTR National Award in 2001 and he also won eight Filmfare Awards.\n\nHrishikesh Mukherjee was born in the city of Calcutta in pre-independence India (now Kolkata) to a Bengali family. He studied science and graduated in chemistry from the University of Calcutta. He taught mathematics and science for some time.\n\nMukherjee chose to begin working, initially as a cameraman, and then film editor, in B. N. Sircar's New Theatres in Calcutta in the late 1940s, where he learned his skills from Subodh Mitter ('Kenchida'), a well known editor of his times. He then worked with Bimal Roy in Mumbai as film editor and assistant director from 1951, participating in the landmark Roy films \"Do Bigha Zamin\" and \"Devdas\".\n\nHis debut directorial venture, \"Musafir\" (1957), was not a success, but he persisted and received acclaim for his second film \"Anari\" in 1959. The film, crew and cast won five Filmfare Awards, with Mukherjee only losing the Best Director Award to his mentor, Bimal Roy.\n\nIn the following years he made numerous films.

He was the first to introduce Dharmendra in comedy roles, through \"Chupke Chupke\", and gave Amitabh Bachchan his big break with \"Anand\" in 1970, along with Rajesh Khanna, he also introduced Jaya Bhaduri to Hindi cinema in his film \"Guddi\". Having worked with his mentor, Bimal Roy as an editor, in films like \"Madhumati\", he was much sought after as an editor as well.\n\nHrishikesh Mukherjee was honoured with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award by the Government of India, in 1999.

{"id": "1933156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933156", "title": "European Boxing Union", "text": "European Boxing Union\n\nThe European Boxing Union (or EBU) is a pan-European governing body that sanctions championship bouts in professional boxing. The EBU governs the most-prestigious continental title in Europe, the EBU European Championship, in addition to their EBU for competitors from within the European Union and the EBU for those outside the European Union. \n\nThe EBU started life as the (IBU) International Boxing Union in Paris in 1910. The IBU became the EBU in 1946.\n\nDuring most of the 20th century and, specially, during that era's first decades, the EBU recognized many world title fights. The European Boxing Union competed against the American based National Boxing Association (NBA), which staged the more widely recognized world title fights.\n\nThe European Boxing Union went through a period of economical difficulties during World War II. Because one of the organization's most important rules is that every fighter that fights for an EBU title must be a national and a resident of a European country, and all fights must be held in Europe, it became very hard for the European Boxing Union to stage fights. As a consequence, the European Boxing Union suffered financial difficulties during this period.\n\nIn 1963 the WBC was formed when the president of Mexico, Adolfo López Mateos, invited the New York State Athletic Commission, the EBU, the BBBofC, and national sanctioning organizations of dozens of other countries, to form the WBC. The NBA (formed as a rival to the NYSAC) became the WBA in response to NYSAC and all the other major sanctioning bodies (USA-NYSAC, Argentina, England, France, Mexico, Philippines, Panama, Chile, Peru, Venezuela, and Brazil) forming the WBC. The EBU's personnel ultimately decided to recognize regional title bouts instead. \n\nDuring the 1990s, the EBU had some important developments, such as beginning to recognize women's boxing regional championship bouts, and welcoming former Yugoslavian country Bosnia and Herzegovina as a member country. \n\nCurrently, winning an EBU title is considered important, but not necessary, by many European boxers in order to go on and fight for a world title of the four most widely recognized world championship boxing organizations, the WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO. Following the formation of the European Economic Union, the EBU issued subtitles for the Union countries (EBU-EU title) and \"External\" countries (EBU-EE title), below their main EBU title which would cover all 50 countries on the continent and 3/4 billion residents.\n\nThe EBU follows certain rules, but most rules in EBU bouts obey the rules set by the independent boxing commission of the country where an EBU fight will be held at. Some of the EBU rules are that a fighter must not be younger than 20 years of age when fighting for an EBU championship, and that hotel accommodation for boxers, referees and European Boxing Union officials visiting a country for an EBU fight must be paid by the fight's promoter. The EBU does, however, pay for the air or train tickets of referees and officials that travel away from home for an EBU fight. Other rules are also imposed on EBU recognized events, but not many of the EBU rules interfere with the fighting rules to be followed during the fight itself.\n\nThe EBU recognizes world titles sanctioned by the WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO and IBO.

In 1947, the estate comprised 437 villages, encompassing an area of 324 km. It had with a Privy Purse of Rs 70,000/- and enjoyed a revenue of approx. Rs.1,76,000/-.\n\nThe rulers of the estate belonged to the ancient Katoch dynasty which had ruled the former Kangra State. Kangra is credited with being the oldest and largest state in the Punjab Hills.\n\nKangra State was extinguished and annexed by Sikh Empire in 1810. Its ruler was granted the jagir of Lambagraon by Treaty of Jawalamukhi. In 1846 Kangra was annexed to British India as part of the Treaty of Lahore.\n\nAccording to legend, the state of Multan – Jalandhara – Kangra, was also called Trigarta, Bhim Kot, Nagar-Kot, Susarmapura, Katoch, which dates back to 4300 BC. The first modern recorded mention of the state, however, is from the 11th century AD. The Katoch dynasty are reputed to have ruled the town of Kangra and its vicinity since time immemorial. Several very extended interregnums are acknowledged.\n\nDuring the period c.1620–1783 the area was placed under the control of a Mughal garrison. As the Mughal power waned, many former officers of the Mughal empire took autonomous charge of the areas under their power and this situation affected Kangra. Meanwhile, (in 1758), Ghamand Chand, a supposed scion of the dispossessed family, attained a position of power in the Punjab plains, being appointed governor of Jalandhar by Ahmed Shah Abdali. Building upon this ascendency, Ghamand Chand's grandson Sansar Chand rallied an army, ousted the then ruler of Kangra, Saif Ali Khan, and gained possession of his patrimony. This happened in 1783, and Sansar Chand was aided by the Kanhaiya \"misl\", one of several Sikh principalities that ruled the Punjab in that era.\n\nDuring the campaign, Raja Sansar Chand and his mercenary force overran other nearby principalities and compelled the submission of their rulers. He reigned over a relatively large part of present-day Himachal Pradesh for perhaps two decades, but his ambitions brought him into conflict with the Gorkhas ruling the then nascent state of Nepal. The Gorkhas and the recently humbled hill-states allied to invade Kangra in 1806. The Raja was defeated and left with no territory beyond the immediate vicinity of the fortress of Kangra, which he managed to retain with the help of a small Sikh force sent to his aid by Ranjit Singh. In this despair, the Raja treated with Ranjit Singh at Jawalamukhi in 1809. By that treaty, Raja Sansar Chand surrendered his (now largely notional) state to Ranjit Singh, in return for a substantial fief to be held under the suzerainty of the latter. This estate consisted, in 1947, of 20 villages yielding a revenue of Rs. 40,000/- and encompassing an area of 324 km. Ranjit Singh duly established his rule over the land; Sansar Chand received in addition the estate of Lambagraon.\n\nAs a result of the First Anglo-Sikh War (1846), the area between the Sutlej and Ravi rivers, including the hill states, were ceded by the Sikhs to the HEIC. Thus, Lambagraon estate was annexed by the British and was one of the feudatory estates placed under the Simla Hill States' Superintendency. In deference with the ruling dynasty's association with Kangra town (and given the fact that the estate fell within Kangra district) the estate was referred to as \"Kangra-Lambagraon\".\n\nThe princely estate of Kangra-Lambagraon acceded unto the Dominion of India in 1947; the following year, it was merged with its sister states of the erstwhile Simla superintendency to create a province named \"Himachal Pradesh\", administered by a Chief Commissioner.\n\nC. 4300 BC\n\nC. 3000 BC\n\nC. 1500 BC\n\nC. 900 BC\n\nC. 500 BC to\n\nC. 275 BC\n\nC. 100 AD\n\nC. 470 AD\n\nC. 643 AD\n\nC. 853 AD\n\nC. 903 AD\n\nC.1009 AD\n\nC. 1170 AD\n\nC. 1341 AD\n\nC.1405 AD\nC.1450 AD\n\nC.1526–1556 AD\n\nC. 1620 AD\n\nC. 1700 AD\n\nC. 1750 AD\n\nC. 1775 AD to C. 1820 AD\n\nC. 1820 AD\n\n1846 AD\n\n1924 AD\n\n1947 AD\n\n1972 AD\n\n\n"}

Tinonee was founded in 1854 and in the late 1980s became part of Greater Taree City. At the , Tinonee had a population of 734 people.\n\nTinonee is on a road that previously served as the main road from Sydney to Brisbane, which is now called Bucketts Way. A punt, first built, owned and operated by David Scott Targett, licensee of the \"Ferry Inn\", once crossed the Manning River between Tinonee and Taree Estate.\n\nTinonee was once one of the earliest settlements and major commercial hubs on the Manning River.\n\nThe name Tinonee is believed to come from the local aboriginal Biripi people's word \"Tinobi\" which means \"big shark\", or \"Tinobah\" meaning \"place of sharks\".\n\nThe Biripi area takes in such towns as Taree, Wingham, Nabiac, and Tinonee. The Biripi people travelled around their country according to the seasons and the availability of their food sources. They also traded with other Nations for tools, food, and useful equipment. During their travels they harvested the native plants and utilized them for their survival and their traditional practices. These practices were orally handed down over the generations and it is this information has helped to form the basis of this web site.\n\nThe Australian Aboriginal culture is the oldest living culture in the world. The Indigenous people of Australia have inhabited this region for well over 60,000 years. Their history and knowledge is one of an oral nature with the knowledge and wisdom of the very first inhabitants of this land handed down over the millennia so that it still exists today. Aboriginal people have lived in a harmonious way with nature, caring for it and surviving on it. By ensuring nature's survival the Aboriginal people have ensured their own survival.\n\nThe cultural, spiritual and philosophical beliefs may vary between tribes and the knowledge of a group may vary from time to time. With the arrival of European settlers into this area much of the knowledge and customs of the Aboriginal people were slowly changed and some things have been lost or forgotten. Scientists have had to work over recent decades to bridge this gap in Indigenous knowledge.\nEnormous inroads have been made in creating a better understanding of the traditional Indigenous knowledge of the fauna and flora of Australia. This is partly due to the development of a trusting relationship between certain dedicated individuals who have worked at bridging the social and cultural gaps that were created with the occupation and development of this land\n\nFormerly a major river port town, Tinonee through its history has been the host of such industries as shipbuilding, farming, logging, timber milling and broom making. With such activities, Tinonee would have been quite a hub of activity, and at one time hosted numerous hotels and accommodation houses, to cater for the passing trade. Ships built in Tinonee were known to be taken to sea through the entrance at Harrington, and off to the major ports such as Sydney and further afield. The Tinonee Historical Museum is being established to cover local history.\n\nThe old post office serves as a craft and flowers shop and boasts a lovely teahouse overlooking the Manning River and Taree Estate. Newsreels and old and new movies are screened at the Terrace Cinema Museum. This 22-seat cinema is the smallest cinema in Australia. This has been noted in the Guinness Book of World Records. It still uses original projecting equipment and has authentic slides that are still shown from time to time. The Deep Water Shark Gallery displays Aboriginal artwork, including works in wood, clay and paint. Tinonee is also home to a llama visitors centre, where visitors can feed and pat the llamas.\n\nOn the road from Tinonee to Wingham is the Brushy Cutting Lookout which offers scenic views of the Manning Valley. The Manning River at Tinonee is a popular place for waterskiing and boating. Andrew's Reserve is a park on the opposite bank and may be accessed from the Taree by taking Edinburgh Drive through Taree Estate.\n\nTinonee Public School is a co-educational school, with classes from Kindergarten to Grade 6, located adjacent to the Manning River in the historical centre of the town. The school first opened on 1 October 1859 with Mrs Eliza Jane Baxter as the first teacher. At the end of that year, the school boasted an enrolment of 25 pupils. The school website covers its history well.\n\nTinonee is the home to St Luke's Anglican Church, John Knox Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia, and a Uniting Church congregation, all located near the same intersection, near the highest point in the town.\n\nThe current St Luke's Anglican Church was built in 1905, replacing an earlier church dating from the 1860s. Originally a site was set aside on the river flats for an Anglican church allowing people to come to church by boat, but the site was deemed unsuitable because of flooding. St Luke's is situated on a site overlooking the Manning River and was extended in the 1980s when a hall was added to the northern side of the building, allowing wonderful views of the river.\n\nJohn Knox Presbyterian Church was built in 1880 at the corner of Manchester and Winter Streets. This building is home to a congregation of the Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia, and part of the Parish of the Manning. Before the turn of the 20th century services at John Knox were held in Gaelic.\n\nThe Tinonee cemetery is located between the township and Peg Leg Creek on the Bucketts Way.\n\nThe Tinonee Eagles play football on the Tinonee Oval.

He is known for his innovative lines and use of atonality. He was a frequent collaborator with pianist Richie Beirach.\n\nIn June 2010, he received a NEA Jazz Masters lifetime achievement award from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA).\n\nDavid Liebman was born in 1946 into a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York. As a child in 1949 he contracted polio. He began classical piano lessons at the age of nine and saxophone by twelve. His interest in jazz was sparked by seeing John Coltrane perform live in New York City clubs such as Birdland, the Village Vanguard and the Half Note. Throughout high school and college, Liebman pursued his jazz interest by studying with Joe Allard, Lennie Tristano, and Charles Lloyd. Upon graduation from New York University (with a degree in American History), he began to seriously devote himself to the full-time pursuit of being a jazz artist.\n\nIn the early 1970s, after recording with Genya Ravan and Ten Wheel Drive, Liebman took the leading role (as President) in organizing several dozen musicians into a cooperative, Free Life Communication, which became an integral part of the fertile New York loft jazz scene in the early 1970s and was funded by The New York State Council of the Arts and the Space for Innovative Development. After one year spent with Ten Wheel Drive, a rock group with experimental leanings, Liebman secured the saxophone/flute position with the group of John Coltrane's drummer, Elvin Jones. Within two years, Liebman reached the zenith of his apprenticeship period when Miles Davis hired him. These years, 1970–74, were filled with tours and recordings. At the same time, Liebman began exploring his own music, first in the Open Sky Trio with Bob Moses and then with pianist Richie Beirach in the group Lookout Farm. This group recorded for the German-based ECM label as well as A&M Records while touring the U.S., Canada, India, Japan and Europe. Lookout Farm was awarded the number one position in the category \"Group Deserving of Wider Recognition\"in the 1976 \"Down Beat\"'s International Critics' Poll. In these years he also played and recorded with Pee Wee Ellis.\n\nIn 1977, Liebman toured the world with pianist Chick Corea, followed up the next year by the formation of the David Liebman Quintet with John Scofield, Kenny Kirkland and Terumasa Hino as featured sidemen. After several world tours and recordings by the quintet over three years, he reunited with Richard Beirach. They began performing and recording as a duo, as well as creating the group Quest in 1981. Beginning with bassist George Mraz and drummer Al Foster, the group solidified when Ron McClure and Billy Hart joined in 1984. Through 1991, Quest recorded seven CDs, toured extensively and did many workshops with students worldwide.\n\nAfter 23 years with the Dave Liebman Group (featuring guitarist Vic Juris), Liebman formed \"Expansions\" reaching out to the younger generation featuring bassist Tony Marino, pianist Bobby Avey, on reeds Matt Vashlishan and Alex Ritz on drums. Over the past decades, Liebman has often been featured with top European jazz artists such as Joachim Kühn, Daniel Humair, Paolo Fresu, Jon Christensen, Bobo Stenson and in the World View Trio with Austrian drummer Wolfgang Reisenger and French bassist Jean-Paul Celea. His ability to play in so many diverse styles has led to big band and radio orchestra performances with the Brussels Jazz Orchestra, the WDR and NDR in Germany, the Metropole Orchestra of the Netherlands, the new music group Klangforum Wien from Vienna and, most notably, Liebman was the first improviser to perform with the world-famous Ensemble InterContemporain founded by Pierre Boulez in France. On all these occasions, the music is arranged from Liebman's own compositions and improvisations. He has consistently placed among the top finalists in the \"Down Beat\" Critic's and Reader's Polls since 1973 in the Soprano Saxophone category and on occasion, flute. Lieb has been featured on several hundred recordings of which he has been the leader or co-leader on over one hundred. Nearly three hundred original compositions have been recorded. His artistic output has ranged from straight-ahead classic jazz to chamber music, from fusion to avant garde, with numerous CDs featuring original arrangements of the music of Thelonious Monk, Miles Davis, Coltrane, Kurt Weill, Alec Wilder, Cole Porter, Antônio Carlos Jobim, Puccini and the Beatles.\n\nLiebman has published material on a variety of subjects including instructional DVDs. He has also published chamber music and over the years has contributed regularly to various periodicals, such as the \"Saxophone Journal\" and the \"International Association of Jazz Educators Journal.\" He is the author of several milestone books: \"Self Portrait of a Jazz Artist\", \"Jazz Connections: Miles Davis and David Liebman\", \"A Chromatic Approach to Jazz Harmony and Melody\", and \"Developing a Personal Saxophone Sound.\" Several of these books have been translated to other languages.\n\nHis teaching activities at universities and in clinic settings have taken him literally around the world as a result of his varied musical directions and expertise on several instruments, along with an ability to articulate the intricacies of the jazz language, aesthetic and technique. Over the years, he has regularly received grantees to study with him funded by the NEA (U.S.), the Canadian Arts Council, as well as Arts Councils of numerous European countries. In 1989, he founded the International Association of Schools of Jazz (IASJ), an organization dedicated to networking educators and students from international jazz schools through periodic meetings, exchange programs and newsletters. Liebman presently serves as the Artistic Director of the IASJ. He scored music for the JazzEx Ballet Company in the Netherlands in the early 1990s and \"Ocean of Light\" for Katrina and the tsunami tragedies in 2006. Currently, Liebman is the Artist in Residence at the Manhattan School of Music and will be visiting Artist at the University of Toronto for year 2014–15.\n\nLiebman and musicologist Lewis Porter teamed up to develop \"What It Is: The Life of a Jazz Artist\", Liebman's biography. Released in March 2012, the book was well received by jazz critics. In 2018, Liebman donated his 1955–2017 archives to Berklee College of Music.\n\nIn 1989 he was the Artistic Director of the International Association of Schools of Jazz. He was an Artist in Residence at the Manhattan School of Music in New York City, and held an annual Saxophone/Chromatic Harmony Master class held at East Stroudsurg University since 1987.

Berwick Rangers played at a number of other sites in Berwick, including a ground adjacent to the present site at Shielfield. Berwick Rangers first entered the Scottish Football League in 1951. After a successful run in the 1953–54 Scottish Cup, a stand was purchased from Bradford City and the team settled at Shielfield. The ground was opened with a game against Aston Villa. The record attendance at Shielfield Park is 13,365, for the Scottish Cup game against Glasgow Rangers on 28 January 1967, which Berwick won 1–0 in a famous cup upset.\n\nDue to financial problems, Berwick Rangers was forced to sell Shielfield Park to the local council in 1985, who leased it back to the club. Both stand roofs were dismantled in 1990 as a safety precaution. Berwick Rangers nearly went out of business in 1992 and the lease was sold to a greyhound company. The greyhound company initially locked Berwick Rangers out, forcing the club to groundshare with other Second Division clubs. The company eventually relented and allowed the club back in for part of each week.

In 1996, he collaborated with Kamal Haasan for \"Indian\". It was dubbed in Hindi as \"Hindustani\" and Telugu as \"Bharateeyudu\". The film was selected as the country's submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Following \"Indian\", Shankar began work on \"Jeans\", which released in 1998 and became the most expensive film in Indian cinema at that time with a budget of 200 million. Upon release, it became one of the highest grossing Tamil films of the 1990s. He made his production debut through \"Mudhalvan\" (1999). Arjun Sarja joined the project.\n\nShankar opted to remake \"Mudhalvan\" in Hindi as \"Nayak\", thus making his Bollywood debut. \"Nayak\", released in September 2001, was declared a \"Flop\" by Box Office India due to the poor marketing, its high budget and distribution price. It went on to gain a cult status despite not doing well at the box office. Shankar started to work on his next film which was supposed to be a science fiction film titled \"Robot\" that was slated to have Kamal Haasan in the lead, the project was stalled since Kamal Haasan was busy with other projects. Later, the project could not move forward due to budgeting problems.\n\nHis musical entertainer film \"Boys\" was released in 2003, which received mixed response from the critics and audience, prompting it to do only average business. His psychological thriller \"Anniyan\", featuring Vikram in three distinct characters (Ambi, Remo & Anniyan) was released in 2005 with Harris Jayaraj as the composer for his film. \"Anniyan\" turned out to become the second highest grossing Tamil film of 2005. Shortly after the release of \"Anniyan\", it was reported that Shankar had teamed up with Rajinikanth and AVM Productions for a film. He renewed his association with A. R. Rahman with the film. \"\" was made at a budget of 600 million, the most expensive Indian film at that time. He was paid with a record salary of 100 million for the film. After two years of filming, the film released in 2007. Ultimately it went on to become one of the highest grossing Tamil films of that time.\n\nFollowing \"Sivaji\", Shankar revisited the possibilities of opinion regarding the script of \"Robot\", he later decided to make the project in Tamil with Rajinikanth and Aishwarya Rai. The film was produced by South Indian media proprietor, Kalanithi Maran, was renamed as \"Enthiran\" and was made on a budget of 1.32 billion, the most expensive Indian film. Some reports also make it one of the highest grossing Tamil films of the time. After initial reports indicating that Shankar's next film is entitled to be with Siddharth, Shankar started to work on \"Nanban\", the Tamil remake of the 2009 Hindi film \"3 Idiots\" starring Vijay, Jiiva and Srikanth. The film opened in January 2012. After \"Nanban\", it was wrongly reported that Shankar's next film would be called \"Therdal\". On 21 June 2012, Shankar announced his next film named \"I\". A romantic ting revenge upon the people who turned him into a hunchback. Vikram played the lead role, collaborating with Shankar again after \"Anniyan\" (2005), while Amy Jackson was the female lead. The film, made over a period of two and half years, released on 14 January 2015 to positive reviews earned almost 2 billion in 19 days. Then he started working on \"2.0\", a sequel to \"Enthiran\" which is released on 29 November 2018 and received mixed reviews. He is currently working on the pre-production of \"Indian 2\", a sequel to \"Indian\" with Kamal Haasan.\n\nS.Shankar family includes his father Shanmugam, mother Muthulakshmi and his wife Easwari. The couple have three children, a son Arjith and two daughters, Aishwarya and Aditi.\n\n"}
{"id": "1933238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933238", "title": "Pākehā settlers", "text": "Pākehā settlers\n\nPākehā settlers were European emigrants who journeyed to New Zealand, and more specifically to Auckland, the Wellington/Hawkes Bay region, Canterbury and Otago during the 19th century. The ethnic and occupational social composition of these New Zealand Europeans or Pākehā varied from settlement to settlement.\n\nThere was minimal immigration to New Zealand directly after 1769 when Captain James Cook first visited the islands. Between 1805 and 1835 the European population grew very slowly. Most Europeans were itinerant sailors. The Bay of Islands and the Hokianga in Northland had the most Europeans with about 200 in the 1830s. Because there were almost no European women, European men lived with Maori women and the population of part European ancestry grew faster than the purely European population. Before 1835, most migrants were runaway sailors, escaped convicts, sealers, whalers and missionaries with their families. Initially most part European children grew up mainly as Maori, but able to speak fluent English. Some of these children were sent to Australia by their fathers to receive a formal education.\n\nAn early custom of Pakeha settlers was to use the native poroporo berry to make jam. As more settlers arrived, feral pigs released during the earliest visits to the islands, which became known as Captain Cooker types, became scarcer as they were over-hunted. Despite often being poor and burdened with debt, Pakeha settlers working and farming new land benefited from the infrastructure of the British Empire, with secure titles, Crown-granted lands and protection by Land Transfer Acts.\n\nEdward Gibbon Wakefield established the New Zealand Company in 1839. This company was established to attract settlers from England to set up homes and farms in New Zealand. The objective of the company was to bring over a ‘slice of England'. The company wanted a range of people from working class to upper class to establish a similar class system in New Zealand as was in England. Settlers were offered paid passage and the possibility of eventually buying land at a price low enough to attract them, but high enough to make them work manually for a few years to earn it. This principle was applied in many areas throughout New Zealand. Generally, it worked and settlers began to arrive in droves. This continued into the 1850s, with unprecedented masses of Pakeha settlers arriving from Britain and Europe, most of which understood little of local Māori culture and customs.\n\nWellington was the first official settlement set up by the New Zealand Company for recently arrived immigrants. The first settlers arrived at Petone from England in 1840. At this point the majority of immigrants sailed from England, particularly London bit may have originated elsewhere in the UK. Most of those who arrived were timber workers, bullock drivers, shopkeepers, rope makers and artisans. This posed a problem as Wellington was an agricultural settlement but there were few people with the skills to farm the land. It was clear that neither the occupational or social composition of this early settlement was varied and as a result this assisted in giving Wellington a shaky beginning as a developing settlement.\n\nWanganui was the second Wakefield settlement to be established although it was set up with some reluctance. Late 1840 Wellington settlers found that there was insufficient land available in their original settlement to satisfy their land claims and Colonel Wakefield was forced to offer them the option of land in the Wanganui settlement. Bringing with them England's Victorian era cultural practices, their settlement resulted in the social and occupational composition of Wanganui being much the same as Wellington. There was already a Māori population in Wanganui and they disputed the questionable land purchase by the New Zealand Company. There was unrest between the Māori and Pākehā until 1848, when Donald Maclean, an assistant to the Native Protector, sorted out boundaries and land title by purchasing the area officially.\n\nNew Plymouth was the following settlement to be established. Originally the development of the settlement was organised by The Plymouth Company but they merged with the New Zealand Company in 1840, resulting in New Plymouth becoming the next Wakefield settlement. Workers were attracted from England by being offered jobs working on establishing roads in the New Plymouth area. This originally brought a large number of settlers to the region but in 1843 it was no longer financially viable for the English company in charge of this arrangement to offer this opportunity. The company in England to reduce spending gave the local agent and as a result they ended the offer of employment provided by the company. Because of the lack of employment opportunities that this resulted in many settlers left new Plymouth choosing to move to Auckland or even Adelaide. This did leave more job opportunities for the remaining settlers and by the mid-1850s New Plymouth began to prosper; by that time it had a population of 2000. It had the resources to export wheat, barley and oats to other settlements and the land was extremely cultivatable.\n\nIn 1842 The New Zealand Company decided that they would establish a settlement for Scottish Presbyterian immigrants. Fred Tuckett was employed to find the settlement and do the surveying. He settled on Otago in the South Island. Because of the isolation in Otago and the lack of previous development in the area, it was difficult to attract prospective farm owners. However the resident agent for The New Zealand Company who lived in the area was determined to get the scheme underway. A promotional campaign started up in Scotland and a public meeting in the Glasgow Trades Hall inspired people enough to warrant the use of two ships to transport the new settlers to New Zealand. It did take time to establish the settlement in Otago mainly because the majority of the Scottish settlers were only working class and relatively poor. This meant that occupation wise they did everything for themselves, unable to afford to employ labour. Once the settlement had got under way most settlers had succeeded in establishing themselves on farms and were making money from agricultural work.\n\nIn 1848 The Canterbury Association was formed after a meeting between Edward Gibbon Wakefield and businessman John Robert Godley. The Canterbury Association had clear and simple plans. A block of one million acres (4,000 km²) was to be acquired from the New Zealand Company and sold to intending immigrants at £3 per acre.’ (Century of Change, ). The Canterbury Association did not want to have the same problems that The New Zealand Company had with absentee ownership in their settlements. To combat this, the Association required land purchasers or their representatives to be present in the colony before they could buy land. Unfortunately land sales were disappointing and even after a campaign promoting the Canterbury settlement the first batch of settlers included 545 with assisted passages and only 40 paying the full price. Because there were so few people there was not a varied range of labourers available, the majority of settlers were farmers and as a result it took longer to get the settlement underway.\n\nAuckland was initially an unplanned settlement, established solely by settlers themselves through migration and immigration to the area. Land was easy to purchase from Maori as the isthmus had been fought over by many hapu for several generations during the musket wars and the native population had either been killed and eaten as at Panmure or fled or welcomed the protection afforded by large numbers of Europeans and their technology. The whole of Eastern Auckland was bought by William Fairburn after local Maori pleaded with him to buy the land to protect then from the feared Ngapuhi invaders. After 1847 large numbers of retired British soldiers called fencibles and their families came to Auckland and established new outlying settlements at Panmure, Howick, Otahuhu and Onehunga. They were organized by Governor Grey. These formed a defensive ring against any possible Maori attack from the south. By 1853 there were approximately 8000 people living in the Auckland area with a wide range of skills among them and with about 17000 acres (69 km²) in crops. Auckland was the closest in New Zealand to an agricultural settlement. Auckland established itself so well that Lt. Gov. Hobson picked it out to become the new capital of New Zealand and as a result, the land was officially purchased from the remaining resident Māori in the area – the Ngāti Whātua.\n\nPakeha settlers were still arriving well into the 20th century, with Department of Health statistics showing that post-1900, tuberculosis was still the main cause of unnatural death among them. The 1906-1908 Native Land Commission, headed by Robert Stout and Āpirana Ngata, encouraged the sale of unoccupied or seemingly underdeveloped Māori lands to Pakeha settlers. Historian David Vernon Williams suggests, by the early 20th century, \"colonial state power had overwhelmed tribal rangatiratanga in an insistent and persistent exercise of forceful measures to individualise land holdings and to promote colonisation by Pakeha settlers\".\n\nThe voyage from England to New Zealand was long and arduous and often took over three months so settlers choosing to move to New Zealand had to have good incentives. One factor that attracted people to New Zealand was the fact that it was such a young country. It was not highly political like England, did not have a rigid class structure and, in their opinion, New Zealand provided equal opportunities for all new immigrants. This newness gave settlers a chance to start from scratch at the same level everybody else was starting and to many people who may have struggled financially in England, this was very attractive.\n\nCampaign posters advertising New Zealand in England did give many settlers false hopes, manipulating their reasons. These posters often described New Zealand as an island paradise, complete with white sandy beaches and coconut trees. This heavenly image also did a lot to attract settlers to New Zealand, as it was such a welcome contrast to the rain and cold weather in England. Many settlers also believed that the paradise New Zealand was presented as would be good for their families' health as the warm weather as well as the small population in New Zealand could keep dangerous diseases that were arising in England to a minimum in New Zealand.\n\nAnother factor in attracting people to New Zealand was families who had already settled writing to their relatives back in Great Britain telling them what a wonderful place New Zealand was. Sometimes these letters were sincere and people truly had discovered a much better life in New Zealand and wanted their relatives to share in the spoils, but sometimes there were other motives. Pure loneliness and isolation could encourage people to write exaggerated letters to their relatives in the hope of luring their extended families to join them thus providing them with some comfort. There were also settlers who were afraid to admit to their families back home that they had made a mistake in coming to New Zealand and so, to save face they chose to exaggerate the positive sides of living in New Zealand and keep quiet about the negative factors. This writing of letters by settlers back to their families in the United Kingdom resulted in a chain reaction as more and more people were encouraged to come out and join their families.\n\nAnother factor in attracting people to New Zealand was undoubtedly the prospect of owning land. The New Zealand Company had purchased large amounts of land from local Māori, which they were willing to sell to settlers at a low price as a way of attracting them to New Zealand. At this time Europeans were seen by Maori as a tuku or gift as they brought with them new skills and technology. The scheme worked, thousands of people who would have had no hope of owning land in the United Kingdom were given the opportunity to do so in New Zealand. Settlers found this attractive because they could farm it and make money from it as well as being able to keep it in the family for future generations. Few of the new settlers understood Maori or the recent history of wholesale tribal upheaval, nor the Maori tradition of associating mana or power with the conquering of land.\n\nThe settlements of Wellington, Wanganui, Nelson, New Plymouth, Otago, Canterbury and Auckland were vital in allowing New Zealand to prosper. Although their development did not always go according to plan, they provided New Zealand with a good foundation of settlements in which farming and industry could be established so that eventually New Zealand could become a viable country for trade. Although there was not originally a large range of occupations and races in the society, the establishment of large towns did provide opportunity for the occupational and social composition to become more diverse as more settlers arrived. New Zealand did have many problems as a developing country but often the life it offered prospective settlers was better than anything they could have hoped for in Great Britain. The chance of jobs, land ownership and a healthier environment for children to grow up in was often worth the long voyage and hard work which were necessities for new immigrants.\n\nEarly Pakeha settlers brought a range of European customs with them to what would become New Zealand. According to Christchurch newspaper \"The Press\", European emigrants to Aotearoa transported over many of their cultural and political norms; \"Pakeha settlers brought with them a profound belief in self-reliance, property rights, and the autonomy of local communities\". Property rights came with a new and foreign understanding, alien to the native customs; both an ideological and distinctively European concept.\n\nIn the 2004 essay \"\"Cultural vandalism\" and Pakeha politics of guilt and responsibility\", the concept of white guilt, or Pakeha guilt, is explored as a legacy of colonial settlement. In 2002, then in opposition, future Prime Minister Bill English, was said to reject the \"cringing guilt\" from the legacy of Pakeha settlers, after the government Race Relations Commissioner compared the cultural impact of European settlement in the islands, with the Taliban destruction of the Buddhas of Bamyan.\n\nElizabeth Rata has argued that while the Waitangi Tribunal had served as a chance to acknowledge wrongs and resolve Pakeha guilt, the opportunity was missed; \"Without the mirror image of unexpiated guilt, a necessary process in the recognition and validation of a shared reality, Pakeha guilt moved, not onto the next stage of externalised shame, but into an internal and enclosed narcissism\". In 2007, anthropologist Michael Jackson wrote that the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa was an expression of residual \"liberal Pākehā guilt\" in its \"extolling Māori spiritual superiority and pandering to the stereoptype of crass Western materialism, Pākehā seek to compensate Māori for their political powerlessness without actually changing the status quo\".\n"}

Shochiku is considered the oldest company in Japan involved in present-day film production, but Nikkatsu began earlier as a pure film studio in 1912. Founded by the brothers Takejirō Ōtani (大谷竹次郎) and Matsujirō Shirai (白井松次郎), it was named “Matsutake” in 1902 after the combined \"kunyomi\" reading of the \"kanji\" \"take\" (bamboo) and \"matsu\" (pine) from their names, reflecting the traditional three symbols of happiness: bamboo, pine, and plum. The \"onyomi\" reading of \"Shōchiku\" first appeared in 1920 with the founding of the film production subsidiary \"Shōchiku Kinema Gōmei-sha\".\n\nShochiku grew quickly in the early years, expanding its business to many other Japanese live theatrical styles, including \"Noh\" and \"Bunraku\", and established a near monopoly due to its ownership of theaters, as well as \"kabuki\" and \"shimpa\" drama troupes.\n\nThe company began making films in 1920, about a decade after its main rival Nikkatsu. The company sought to break away from the prevailing pattern of \"jidai-geki\" and to emulate Hollywood standards. It was the first film studio to abandon the use of female impersonators and brought new ideas, including the star system and the sound stage to Japan. It built its main studio at Kamata, between Tokyo and Yokohama, and hired Henry Kotani, a Japanese who had worked in Hollywood as an actor and cameraman to direct its first film, \"Island Woman\" (\"Shima no Onna\", 1920). It also hired the prominent theater director Kaoru Osanai to head a school at the studio, which produced the film \"Souls on the Road\" (1921), a film directed by Minoru Murata which is considered \"the first landmark film in Japanese history\".\n\nHowever, Shochiku's early history was difficult, as audiences preferred the more action-packed \"jidai-geki\" historical swashbucklers over the shinpa melodramas, and its Kamata studios were destroyed by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, forcing a temporary relocation to Kyoto.\n\nWith the reopening of its Kamata studios, Shochiku also introduced the \"shomin-geki\" genre, with stories reflecting the lives of the lower-middle urban classes. These dramas proved immensely popular, and marked the start of the careers of many prominent directors (including Ozu, Naruse, and Hiroshi Shimizu) and actors (including Kinuyo Tanaka).\n\nIn 1931, Shochiku released the first “talkie” made in Japan: \"The Neighbor's Wife and Mine\" \"(Madamu to nyōbō\", 1930). Filming became increasing difficult at the Kamata studios during the 1930s with the rapid industrialization of the surrounding area with munitions factories and metal foundries, and Shochiku decided to close the studio and relocate to Ofuna, near Kamakura in 1936. The following year, Shochiku Kinema was merged with its parent company, Shochiku Entertainment, and adopted the new name of Shochiku Corporation.\n\nDuring the war years, Shochiku's President, Shiro Kido, helped establish the Dai Nippon Eiga Kyokai (Greater Japan Film association), whose purpose was to coordinate the industry's efforts with Japanese government policy. From the mid-1930s until 1945, the films produced by Shochiku and other Japanese movie companies were propagandistic.\n\nAfter the surrender of Japan, Kido and Shochiku's co-founder Otani were arrested and charged with Class-A war crimes by the Allied occupation authorities.\n\nIn 1953, after the end of the occupation, Kido returned to Shochiku and revived the melodramatic style of films which had been a Shochiku trademark in the pre-war era. Directors associated with Shochiku in this era included Ozu, Keisuke Kinoshita, Noboru Nakamura and Hideo Oba. Many of the films during the 1950s were aimed primarily at female audiences. In particular, Hideo Oba's three-part “What is Your Name?” (Kimi no na wa?, 1953) was the most commercially successful film of the period. Ozu's \"Tokyo Story\", made in 1953, later earned considerable accolades, being selected in the 2012 Sight & Sound international critics poll as the third best film of all time\n\nBy the start of the 1960s, Shochiku's films were criticized as “old-fashioned” with the popularity of rival Nikkatsu’s \"Taiyo-zoku\" youth-orientated movies. The studio responded by launching the Japanese New Wave (\"Nuberu bagu\") which also launched the career of Nagisa Oshima among others, though Oshima soon went independent; the films of Oshima and other film makers were not financially successful and the company changed its policies.\n\nHowever, the growing threat of television led to the bankruptcy of Shochiku’s competitors, Shintoho in 1961 and Daiei in 1971, whereas Nikkatsu and Toei turned to gangster movies and soft pornography to maintain attendance. Shochiku continued to maintain its family-orientated audience largely due to the phenomenal success of the \"Otoko wa Tsurai yo\" series directed by Yoji Yamada from 1969 through 1997. However, with the death of its star Kiyoshi Atsumi, the series came to an end, and the company faced increasing financial difficulties.\n\nThe Ofuna studio was briefly transformed into a theme park, Kamakura Cinema World, but this was closed in 1998 and the site was sold off in 2000 to Kamakura Women's College.\n\nSince that time, Shochiku has relied on its film studio and backlot in Kyoto.\n\nYamada’s “The Twilight Samurai” (Tasogare Seibei, 2002) was nominated for an Oscar as Best Foreign Language Picture.\n\nShochiku has also served as a distributor of theatrical anime. Major titles have included the \"Cardcaptor Sakura\" films, \"Mobile Suit Gundam\" movies, \"\", \"Piano no Mori\", \"Ghost in the Shell\", \"\", \"\", \"Sword of the Stranger\", \"\" and \"Jungle Emperor Leo\".\n\n\"as of October 2015\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1933263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933263", "title": "Albany Choppers", "text": "Albany Choppers\n\nThe Albany Choppers was an independent professional ice hockey team in Albany, New York competing in the International Hockey League during the 1990–1991 season. \n\nThe Fort Wayne Komets had been mainstays of the IHL for four decades. Before the 1990-91 season, its owner, gravel magnate David Welker, opted to move his franchise to Albany. The city had recently built Knickerbocker Arena, which was built to National Hockey League standards of the time. They represented the IHL's first effort in years to push beyond its traditional heartland in the Great Lakes; they were the easternmost team in the IHL since the Johnstown Jets left the league in 1955. The Schenectady-based Price Chopper supermarket chain bought in as a minority partner—hence the name and colors of red, white and blue, which matched Price Chopper's corporate hues.\n\nAmong players for the Choppers were goaltenders Rick Knickle, former St. Louis Blue Bruce Racine and former Boston Bruin John Blue; former New York Islander and team captain Dale Henry, former Minnesota North Star Dave Richter, and Mario Lemieux's brother, center Alain Lemieux, who was the team's leading scorer until he was traded for cash. A large number of players were ex-Springfield Indians, including Henry, Lemieux, forwards Stu Burnie, Bob Bodak and Jim McGeough, and defensemen Vern Smith, Manny Vivieros and Gord Paddock. The head coach was Dave Allison.\n\nThe team began play in the 1990–91 season, but ran into several major roadblocks. By this time, the IHL had firmly established itself as a top-level feeder league for the NHL. The entrenched American Hockey League was unnerved by the IHL's expansion into its traditional stronghold in the Northeast, and hastily planted a team just across the Hudson River in neighboring Troy, the Capital District Islanders. Moreover, the three-time Calder Cup champion Adirondack Red Wings were less than fifty miles north in Glens Falls. Never in recent history had so many minor-league teams been crammed into such a small market. It did not help matters that the perennial college hockey powerhouse RPI Engineers also played in Troy. All three suffered at the gate through the subsequent price wars (although RPI benefited from having the Capital District Islanders as a tenant).\n\nHowever, the Choppers suffered the most. Not only were they essentially an expansion team, but they also had to foot the travel expenses for six IHL teams as a condition of being allowed to move to Albany. They were unable to secure a full NHL affiliation (and its subsidized salaries); they had to settle for a secondary affiliation with the Vancouver Canucks. They only had 11 players with NHL contracts.\n\nThe team sank into last place, and attendance plummeted; for numerous games attendance in the cavernous 'Knick' (capacity 15,000) was no more than a few hundred fans. After local media reported attendance figures at odds with the ones management was reporting (by quite literally counting heads), the team ceased to report attendance altogether, while giving season tickets away outright.\n\nAs it was, the team hemorrhaged funds, held back by the most expensive travel budget in the IHL and a lack of natural rivalries. Their nearest opponent was the new Komets (Welker's franchise had been replaced by the relocated Flint Spirits team, which took the Komets' name and history), some 670 miles west. At one point, the team struggled to meet payroll, missing it several times, and supplies ran short. One notorious incident came during an overtime game against the Komets, when Jim McGeough was sent out for the final shot in a shootout because he had the only sound hockey stick remaining on the bench.\n\nBy December, the Choppers were gasping. Their assets had been frozen when a travel agency sued them for non-payment, and they lost their radio flagship due to three months of unpaid bills. Out of desperation, Allison put all of the players who did not have NHL contracts on waivers. The Milwaukee Admirals claimed Henry, forcing the Choppers to trade Lemieux to the Admirals to get Henry back. However, it was understood that Lemieux would return to Albany if Welker found a buyer for the team.\n\nThe end came in February, when Price Chopper announced it was pulling its sponsorship and its investment after the season, citing a poor relationship with Welker and lackluster promotion. By February 14, the Choppers were so short of cash that they were not only about to miss payroll again, but lacked enough money for their next road trip. Even though they had won six of their last nine games and were in contention for a playoff berth, no credible buyers were on the horizon. Welker finally gave up and shuttered the team that night. The Capital District Islanders promptly honored all Choppers season tickets in an attempt to boost their own attendance. Somewhat ironically, Henry, Knickle and Vivieros finished the season back in Springfield, where they helped the Indians to their final Calder Cup championship, while leading goal scorer Yves Héroux would move to the Peoria Rivermen and prove key in their own Turner Cup championship in that same season against the Komets, the team with whom Burnie signed. Lemieux, Burnie and Richter retired after the season. Defenseman Scott Drevitch was the final Chopper active in professional hockey, playing for the Elmira Jackals of the United Hockey League in the 2006–2007 season.\n"}
{"id": "1933282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933282", "title": "Stanisław Kopański", "text": "Stanisław Kopański\n\nGeneral Stanisław Kopański (May 19, 1895 – March 23, 1976) was a Polish military commander, politician, diplomat, an engineer and one of the best-educated Polish officers of the time, serving with distinction during World War II. He is best known as the creator and commander of the Polish Independent Carpathian Brigade and Polish 3rd Carpathian Infantry Division.\n\nBetween 1943 and 1946, he was Chief of Staff of the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Armed Forces in the West.\n\nStanisław Kopański was born on May 19, 1895, in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire to Polish parents. In 1905, he enrolled in a local Polish gymnasium (high school), where he graduated upon passing his \"matura\" examinations. Afterwards, he matriculated in a local Institute of Civil Engineering, but his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I.\n\nIn 1914, Kopański was drafted into the Russian Army. He graduated from the Mikhailovskoye School of Artillery and served on the war's eastern front in the 3rd battery of the Russian 2nd Cavalry Division. After the February Revolution, he left the Russian Army and joined the Polish 1st Corps, being formed in Russia as part of the Entente forces. Demobilized after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, he left for Warsaw (then still occupied by the Central Powers), where he planned to enter the reopened Warsaw University to complete his education.\n\nKopański was unable to realize his plans, however, as Poland regained its independence in November 1918 and immediately became engaged in the Polish–Ukrainian War. The Polish Army badly needed experienced officers, and Kopański joined the 1st Uhlans Regiment, with which he fought in the battles of Przemyśl, Gródek Jagielloński and Lwów.\n\nAt the end of hostilities, Kopański remained in the army and fought in the opening stages of the Polish–Soviet War in the Lida and Wilno areas, in the forces of Colonel Władysław Belina-Prażmowski. On April 20, 1919, during the fighting in Wilno, he was badly wounded and lost his left eye. Following a brief hospitalization, he returned to active service, this time as commander of the Artillery NCO School in Warsaw.\n\nHowever, Kopański requested to be sent back to the front and in September 1919, became commander of the 1st Mounted Artillery Detachment. In 1920, he joined the 8th Uhlans Regiment, with which he took part in the famous battles of Komarów and Tyszowce. In October 1920, he was awarded the Silver Cross of Virtuti Militari.\n\nAfter the Peace of Riga, Kopański was demobilized and allowed to finally finish his engineering studies, this time at the Warsaw University of Technology. However, in 1923, he returned to army service and became the deputy commander of the Artillery Officers School in Toruń. Promoted to the rank of major in 1924, he held that post until 1927. In October of that year, he was dispatched to Paris, where he commenced his studies at the Ecole Superieure de Guerre, one of the most notable military academies of the time. After a brief service in the French School for Artillery Officers, he returned to Poland, where he became the commander of the 3rd Detachment of the General Staff (\"Operational\"). In May 1930, he became the commanding officer of one of the battalions within the 6th Heavy Artillery Regiment, stationed in Lwów, but resumed his post in the General Staff a year later. In early 1935, he became the deputy commander of armoured troops and, after additional two years of service there, he was made the commanding officer of the Stryj-based Polish 1st Regiment of Self-propelled Artillery, the most technologically advanced Polish artillery unit of the time. On March 13, 1939, in the course of the Polish secret mobilization, Kopański became the head of the 3rd Detachment of the General Staff and six days later, he was promoted to colonel.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Polish Defensive War, Kopański remained on the staff of Marshal of Poland Edward Rydz-Śmigły. The staff was evacuated from Warsaw on September 6, 1939, to Polish temporary headquarters in Brześć nad Bugiem. However, due to fast pace of German advance, the headquarters had to be evacuated further southwards, through Młynów, Kołomyja and Kosów, to the town of Kuty, where it was to organize the defense of the so-called Romanian Bridgehead. However, the Soviet invasion of Poland of September 17, 1939 made that plan obsolete and Kopański was evacuated to Romania, a country which at that time was allied with Poland. There, at both German and French insistence, the Polish highest authorities were interned by the Romanians. However, most of the soldiers interned in prisoner of war camps were able to escape with the secret consent of the Romanian authorities; Kopański himself fled the Călimăneşti internment camp, traveling through Bucharest and Constanţa to reach France in late October 1939.\n\nIn France, Kopański applied for a post in one of the Polish units being formed in France and Great Britain at that time. Initially, however, the Polish government in exile of Władysław Sikorski held most of the high-ranking officers of the pre-war Polish Army in reserve and instead gave command of newly formed units to officers who had actively opposed the Sanacja authorities before the lost campaign. It was not until April 5, 1940, that Kopański was finally given command of the Polish Carpathian Brigade, being formed in Homs on the border between French-held Syria and Lebanon.\n\nThe unit was composed mostly of Polish soldiers who were able to escape prisoner of war camps in Hungary and Romania and make it to Allied-controlled territory, much like Kopański himself. On April 12, 1940, the brigade was officially formed and the new unit joined the French Armée du Levant. As a unit specializing in mountain warfare, the brigade was thought of as a Polish contribution to the Allied plan of landing in the Balkans. It was modelled after a standard French mountain infantry brigade. Although new recruits arrived on a daily basis, the brigade did not reach the planned strength of 208 officers and 6840 soldiers and NCOs.\n\nAfter the capitulation of France nullified all pacts that country had with Poland and the United Kingdom, the commander of the Armee de Levant, General Eugène Mittelhauser, decided to support the new government of Philippe Pétain and Vichy France. He ordered the brigade to be disarmed and took Kopański as a hostage. However, due to strong opposition within Mittelhauser's own staff, he had to set Kopański free the following day. Kopański then followed the orders of General Sikorski and left French-controlled territory. On June 30, 1940, the brigade defected to the British Mandate of Palestine, where it joined the British forces stationed there. It was the only large military unit of the Armee de Levant to defect as a complete unit, with all of its equipment.\n\nInitially composed of 319 officers and 3,437 soldiers, Kopański's brigade soon grew to roughly 5,000 men. Among the distinctive features of the unit was the high morale of the soldiers, all volunteers. In addition, roughly 25 percent were educated, a thing uncommon in European armies of the time. Kopański continued to train his men in mountain warfare, but also in warfare in desert conditions, completely alien to the Polish soldiers. In August 1941, the brigade was moved by sea from Palestine to the besieged town of Tobruk, where the unit took part in the final four months of the siege. After the siege was lifted on December 10, the brigade joined British forces in their pursuit of the withdrawing Italo-German armies and fought in the Battle of Gazala.\n\nOn April 21, 1942, after more than two years in constant service, Kopański was given a three weeks leave in London. On the day of his arrival there, he was appointed by General Sikorski as commander of the newly formed 3rd Carpathian Rifle Division. He organized that division out of his former unit and newly arrived soldiers of the Polish II Corps of General Władysław Anders, who had been liberated from Soviet gulags and then evacuated to Persia and Palestine. His new division was prepared and trained to take part in the Italian Campaign.\n\nShortly before the invasion of Italy commenced, Kopański was withdrawn to London on July 21, 1943, where he was appointed Chief of Staff of the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Armed Forces in the West. A skilled front-line officer, Kopański did not have much work \"behind the desk\", especially since, while most of the Polish units were fighting under Polish command, they were part of Allied fronts and armies. Because of that, on October 20, 1944, Kopański tried to resign. However, the President of Poland, Władysław Raczkiewicz, would not accept his resignation; instead, Kopański was promoted to the rank of Division General two days later. He remained Chief of Staff of the Polish Armed Forces until the end of World War II.\n\nAfter the war the Allied governments withdrew their support from the Polish government, and the Polish forces were transformed into the Polish Resettlement Corps. This was a paramilitary organization designed to allow Polish veterans who were unwilling to return to communist-dominated Poland to find employment and homes in the west. In 1946 Kopański, became commander of the corps, and on 26 September that year he was deprived of Polish citizenship by the Communists.\n\nAfter the corps disbanded in 1949, Kopański settled in the United Kingdom. He remained an active member of the Polish government-in-exile and until 1970, held the honorary title of Chief of General Staff. On May 13 of that year, his office was disbanded and transformed into the office of the General Inspector of Polish Armed Forces in Exile. The post, despite its name, was connected mostly with historical activity and Kopański focused on supporting various social and economic veteran associations. He also collaborated with the Sikorski Institute. Between 1970 and 1973 he was also a member of the Council of Three, a collegial body created by the Polish Government in Exile in 1954 with prerogatives of the President of Poland. Stanisław Kopański also wrote a number of books and memoirs.\n\nOn November 23, 1971, the Communist authorities of Poland declared their decision to deprive Kopański of citizenship null and void; this however was never made public. He died March 23, 1976 in London and was buried at the Northwood Cemetery.\n\n\n\n"}

The Boston Lodge address and postcode is shared by the works with four cottage dwellings (mostly occupied in connection with the railway) and with the former tollgate cottage at the end of the causeway. The original 'Penrhyn Isa' cottage (now the railway works office) was renamed 'Boston Lodge' after Boston, Lincolnshire, the parliamentary seat of William Madocks, the proprietor of the land reclamation venture.\n\nConstruction of the causeway, known locally as ‘The Cob’, linking Penrhyn Isa on the Merioneth shore with the small rocky island called Ynys Towyn (where Britannia Terrace now stands in Porthmadog) near the Caernarfonshire shore, started in 1807 and was completed in 1811 during which time large quantities of stone was quarried and extracted from both ends. The embankment, which was the final stage of the Traeth Mawr land reclamation scheme, was wide at the top (where the railway now runs), wide at the base, deep and about in length. The quarrying created both the Britannia Terrace site at Porthmadog and the railway workshops site at Boston Lodge.\n\nThe site at Boston Lodge first held barracks for many of the 150 men working from the Merioneth side on the embankment construction, together with stables and smithies for the horses and wagons used to carry the stone. Later with the coming of the horsedrawn Festiniog Railway, the stables and smithies were brought back into use from 1836 onwards and there has been almost continuous development of the site for railway purposes since that time.\n\nIn the years from 1847 to 1851 the Works was considerably developed by the construction of ferrous and non-ferrous foundries, a pattern making shop, a blacksmith's shop, a carpenter's shop, and an engine house in which a steam engine provided power for machinery in a sawmill, pattern shop and machine shops. In the 1870s further construction provided a paint shop, joiner's shop and erecting shop in which in 1879 and 1885 the double Fairlie engines \"Merddin Emrys\" and \"Livingston Thompson\" were built. Prior to 1915 the works employed about 30 men. During World War I most of the works was used as a munitions factory (largely staffed by women) from 17 September 1915 until early in 1919. The fortunes of the railway and its works declined from the mid-1920s with total closure from March 1947 to September 1954.\n\nThe works reopened on 20 September 1954, since when many of the original buildings have been extensively repaired and their usage altered. Machinery has been updated and modern materials and techniques have been introduced. Additional workshops have been built as well as new locomotive servicing facilities and carriage storage depots. The works undertakes the restoration and preservation of the railway's historic locomotives, carriages, wagons and features of all descriptions. It also builds new steam locomotives and passenger carriages, and undertakes the ongoing maintenance of the Ffestiniog Railway's expanding fleet of railway vehicles.\n\nIn 1977, Boston lodge works undertook the design and installation of oil-firing equipment on the British Railways locomotive \"Owain Glyndwr\" on the Vale of Rheidol Railway. This was probably the first of numerous outside contracts that the works has undertaken over the years. These outside contracts have included restoration work on steam engines and the complete construction of various replica narrow-gauge passenger coaches.\n\nIn December 1998, a £375,000 Heritage Lottery Fund Grant was awarded to the FR Trust and this provided, amongst other things, for the construction of an extension to the carriage workshop at Boston Lodge to form a ‘Heritage Centre’ that would be a permanent home for the restoration of historic vehicles in a secure environment. Restoration to a very high standard has included most of the surviving Ffestiniog Railway Victorian era passenger coaches and a carefully selected rake of about 50 slate wagons representing most of the variant types characteristic of the local slate operations.\n\nFrom 1993 onwards Boston Lodge works has undertaken extensive locomotive restoration work for the Ffestiniog Railway owned Welsh Highland Railway (Caernarfon). Recently the works is undertaking the construction of new passenger carriages for service between Caernarfon and Porthmadog.\n\nIn the aerial photograph at right, at the end of the embankment (this end being called locally 'Pen Cob') is the junction into the railway works yard. To the forefront of the works site is the large white building that is Nos: 1 and 2 Boston Lodge Cottages. Next to which, on the right, is the original 'Penrhyn Isa Cottage/Boston Lodge' now the works offices. All the rest in that area is railway works and storage buildings.\n\nBelow the railway is the A487 road and in front of that is the 1836 tollgate cottage. Prior to the coming of the Ffestiniog Railway, the road was on the top of the embankment, but in 1836 the present carriageway was constructed on the landward side at the lower level. This lower road was less than wide and quite narrow for a major road. In 2002 it was widened to over with, in addition, a separate cycleway and footpath on the landward side.\n\nFrom its construction in 1811, a toll was levied on users of the embankment. Subsequent to the construction of the Ffestiniog Railway, a new toll road and toll house was built on the landward side adjacent to the embankment but at a lower level. For motor cars, for many years, the toll was a modest one shilling per day (regardless of how many times the vehicle used the road). After the introduction of decimal currency in 1971 the toll became five pence. In the late 1970s the ownership of the tollgate and its cottage was acquired by a specially established local charitable trust called \"The Rebecca Trust\", which continued to levy the same toll and distributed its profits to local charities. At 3:00pm on Saturday 29 March 2003, the tollgate and its cottage having been bought from the Rebecca Trustees by the Welsh Assembly Government, the toll (still just five pence per day) ceased to be levied.\n\nA number of locomotives have been built for the Ffestiniog Railway at Boston Lodge works\n\n"}

He played college basketball for Kentucky.\n\nBogans attended The Langley School in McLean, Virginia and DeMatha Catholic High School in Hyattsville, Maryland, and was an All-American first team honoree in his senior year. He was coached by Morgan Wootten, leading DeMatha to a 34–1 record and a number three national ranking in 1999. He was recruited by the University of Kentucky, and was a four-year starter for the Wildcats under coach Tubby Smith. In his senior year at UK, he led the 2002–03 Wildcats to a 16–0 sweep of the Southeastern Conference and the SEC Tournament title, finishing with an Elite Eight run in the NCAA Tournament. He was an All-American as a college senior when he averaged 15.7 points, 3.8 rebounds, 2.7 assists, and 1.2 steals. He was also 80-for-209 from three-point range. His illustrious collegiate career ended as he limped off the court at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, after playing the game on a severely sprained ankle. The Wildcats ended up losing to Dwyane Wade's Marquette squad in the Elite 8.\n\nOn September 26, 2014, Bogans was inducted into the University of Kentucky Athletics Hall of Fame.\n\nBogans was chosen in the second round with the 43rd pick in the 2003 NBA draft by the Milwaukee Bucks, but was traded to the Orlando Magic on draft day. Bogans started in half of the games he played in his rookie season, averaging 6.8 points, 4.3 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game.\n\nThe Magic traded Bogans to the Charlotte Bobcats in exchange for Brandon Hunter on November 1, 2004. Bogans continued his development as a player for the Bobcats in the 2004–05 season, starting in 42 of his 76 games and averaging 9.6 points per game.\n\nOn February 9, 2006, Bogans was traded to the Rockets for Lonny Baxter. Chuck Hayes and Gerald Fitch, Bogans' former teammates at the University of Kentucky, along with himself, were all at one point members of the Rockets (although Fitch never actually played as he was released).\n\nBogans re-signed with the Magic in July 2006 as a free-agent.\n\nOn November 22, 2008, Bogans, starting his first game of 2008–09 season, broke his thumb on his non-shooting hand in a game against the Houston Rockets.

Though his statistics were considered modest for a starter, coach Tom Thibodeau praised Bogans' defense, saying \"If he's guarding you, you know he's guarding you. He's going to make you work. He's a physical player.\" Bogans said about his offense that people \"need to understand that's not why I'm here. I'm on the floor with Luol (Deng), Derrick (Rose), Carlos (Boozer)... there aren't a lot of shots for me and [reserve center] Kurt (Thomas).\"\n\nOn March 15, 2011, Bogans scored a season-high 17 points in a win against the Washington Wizards to help the Bulls secure the top-seed of the Eastern Conference.\n\nBogans also scored 15 points in the fifth game of the first playoff series against the Indiana Pacers where the Bulls guaranteed their pass to the second round. The Bulls made it to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they lost to the Miami Heat. Bogans played and started in all postseason games.\n\nOn December 9, 2011, facing a $1.73 million option for 2011–12, the Bulls called Bogans off the court minutes before the first practice of the NBA season.

On December 16, 2011, Bogans was waived by the Bulls.\n\nOn February 1, 2012, Bogans signed with the New Jersey Nets. Bogans was injured contesting a dunk by Detroit Pistons forward Greg Monroe on February 8, 2012, tearing a deltoid ligament.

{"id": "1933300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933300", "title": "Kadokawa Daiei Studio", "text": "Kadokawa Daiei Studio\n\nKadokawa Daiei Studio, formerly is the film division of the Japanese company the Kadokawa Corporation. It is one of the four members of the Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan (MPPAJ), and is therefore one of Japan's Big Four film studios.\n\nIn 1945, Genyoshi Kadokawa established Kadokawa Shoten Publishing Co., focusing on the publishing business.\n\nIn 1975, Kadokawa's president, Haruki Kadokawa, decided to venture into the film business, launching the film division of Kadokawa Shoten; thus Kadokawa Pictures was born. His goal was to try to reap synergy benefits by creating film adaptations of the publishing house's most popular books and marketing them simultaneously. The company's first film was the 1976 release \"The Inugamis\", directed by Kon Ichikawa and adapted from a Kadokawa Shoten published novel written by Seishi Yokomizo. Due to an aggressive marketing campaign, the film ended as the second-largest earner of the year in Japan.\n\nBetween 1976 and 1993, Kadokawa produced close to 60 films. The company's pictures were usually large-scale epics with sizable budgets and matching advertising campaigns, aimed for mass audiences and box-office success. While critics were not always kind on Kadokawa's works, the films were consistently popular among the viewing public. By 1992, seven out of the top 20 all-time highest box-office grossing Japanese films were Kadokawa productions. During his time at Kadokawa Shoten, Haruki Kadokawa was often hailed as the savior of Japan's struggling film industry. Kadokawa's efforts to branch into foreign markets were consistently less successful. Its biggest failure came in 1992, when the 25 million US$ film \"Ruby Cairo\", starring Andie MacDowell, failed to find a distributor in the United States. Haruki Kadokawa was forced to resign from Kadokawa Shoten after being arrested for smuggling cocaine. The new president was Haruki's younger brother Tsuguhiko, who had previously been forced out of the company in favor of Haruki's son Taro.\n\nKadokawa Shoten later acquired Daiei Film Co. from Tokuma Shoten following the passing of its president, Yasuyoshi Tokuma. In November 2002, Chairman Maihiko Kadokawa announced that Daiei Film Co. would merge with the company's own film division to form Kadokawa-Daiei Film Co., Ltd.\n\nIn March 2004, Kadokawa-Daiei Pictures Inc. acquired a 44% stake in Nippon Herald Films Inc., an independent film distributor founded in 1956, and acquired the remaining 56% stake the following year. It later changed its name to Kadokawa Pictures.\n\nOn March 1, 2006, it merged with the \"Kadokawa Herald\" to become Kadokawa Herald Pictures Inc. and later Kadokawa Pictures. In 2007, it changed its name to Kadokawa Shoten Pictures, with Shinichiro Inoue as its President and CEO.\n\nAfter a merger with Kadokawa Shoten Publishing Co. in 2011, it became the studio division of its parent company, Kadokawa Group Holdings Ltd. and maintained its name, Kadokawa Pictures, focusing on mixed-media business.\n\nAfter the friendly acquisition in 2004, Kadokawa Pictures quickly went to work on several projects. It approached Toho Company Ltd. about co-producing \"Godzilla vs. Gamera\" in 2002, but the offer was rejected, so it turned its attention to reviving some of the combined studio's best-known properties since the Daiei Film Co. era. 2005 saw successful releases for both Masaaki Tezuka's \"Samurai Commando: Mission 1,549\" (\"Sengoku Jieitai 1,549\") and Takashi Miike’s \"The Great Yokai War\" (\"Yokai Daisenso\"). As these two films opened in Japan, it revealed that the studio would begin shooting the 12th Gamera film in July 2005.\n\nFive of their original eight \"Gamera\" films were mocked (twice) on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\". According to Shout! Factory, because of this, they were horrified by the mockery and refused to let Shout! release the \"MST3K\" versions on home video. Brian Ward (one of the members of Shout!

Over the next two years the illustrator Ivor Innes carved the figures of the \"Little People\" into it. These included Wookey the witch, with her three jars of health, wealth and happiness, Huckleberry the gnome, carrying a bag of berries up the Gnomes' Stairway to the banquet within Bark Hall, and Grumples and Groodles the Elves, being awakened by Brownie, Dinkie, Rumplelocks and Hereandthere stealing eggs from the crows' nest.\n\nInnes also illustrated a 1930 children's book written by his wife Elsie and based on the \"Elfin Oak\".

{"id": "1933302", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933302", "title": "Shirley, Southampton", "text": "Shirley, Southampton\n\nShirley is a broad district and a former village on the western side of Southampton, England. Shirley's main roles are retailing and residential. It is the most important suburban shopping area in the west of the city. Housing is a mixture of council houses in the centre of the district surrounded by private housing, with larger suburban houses concentrated in Upper Shirley. Shirley is separated from Highfield by Southampton Common, a large green public space. \n\nThe place-name Shirley commonly means \"bright clearing\", from the Old English very similarly pronounced \"scir\" (bright) and \"leah\" (cleared land in a wood). Shirley is recorded as a manor with a mill in the Domesday Book; the mill standing to the west of the present Romsey Road/Winchester Road junction, at the confluence of the Hollybrook and Tanner's Brook streams. Shirley Mill had three large ponds, to the north of Winchester Road. One of the three mill ponds remains today, accessed by following the Lordswood Greenway.\n\nIn 1228, Nicholas de Sirlie, lord of Shirley, surrendered rights to Southampton Common in return for a small payment and the agreement that the Burgesses of Southampton had no rights of common over the land that would later become Shirley Common. In the nineteenth century an iron works was built, which was converted into a brewery in 1880 and subsequently into a laundry at the beginning of the 20th century. The laundry was owned by Royal Mail and used to service the mail ships visiting Southampton.\n\nThe stream from the mill crossed over the Romsey Road until it was culverted under the major traffic junction which stands there, and continues to the Test to the east of modern Tebourba Way, open in parts and culverted in others. A second mill was built at what is now the junction of Oakley Road and Tebourba Way. This site was later a paint factory known as Atlantic Works and mill buildings survive in commercial use on both sides of Oakley road astride the old mill leat.\n\nThe district grew rapidly in the 1830s following the enclosure of Shirley Common. The Hampshire Chronicle announced in April 1830 that \"Several elegant villas are about to be erected on Shirley Common\". On the 28 November 1830 in the context of the Swing riots there was a non violent protest in Shirley and Millbrook by labourers demanding increased wages. The parish church was built in 1836. A council estate was built in the 1960s to replace relatively dense terraced housing.\n\nThe Shirley Local board of health was established in 1853. It merged with Freemantle in 1880. Shirley and Freemantle Urban District Council was formed on 2 January 1895 but was abolished on 8 November 1895 when the district became a suburb of Southampton.\n\nThe Board originally met in Church Street but moved to Ravenswood in July 1885. Ravenswood had previously been a house: the contents were auctioned off in 1870 following the bankruptcy of Mr. Gabriel Scott who was, however, still living there in 1876. It later became the headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the British Isles. The Board meetings held at Ravenswood are reported in detail in the Hampshire Advertiser. Regular subjects for discussion included the state of the roads, especially surfacing by rolling gravel and the introduction of kerbstones; drainage and sewerage; street lighting; wells; slaughterhouses; and infectious diseases. One meeting in 1893 received statistics concerning scarletina, typhoid fever, diphtheria, erysipelas, and smallpox. Smallpox was a particular issue. At another 1893 meeting, concern was expressed about Southampton's smallpox hospital ship, \"City of Adelaide\", being anchored off Freemantle where children played on the beach. The Board received reports from the South Stoneham Poor Law Union because that Union's responsibilities included \"the parish of Millbrook\" which \"includes the hamlets of Hill, and Sidford, the tything of Millbrook, and the village of Shirley.\"\n\nIn 1887 the Board constructed a drinking fountain to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Originally in Shirley High Street, the fountain has now been incorporated into the shopping precinct. The fountain is Grade II listed. Another was constructed at Fourposts.\n\nBy 1892, Shirley and Freemantle Local Board of Health were considering building new offices on the Brooklyn estate, which the 1860s Ordnance Survey map shows to be consistent with the extant building's location. Plans were submitted in 1892 and a Public inquiry was held in January 1893. The building has a foundation stone laid by W.A.Killby esq, chairman of the Shirley and Freemantle Local Board, 12 June 1893. The stone also mentions that H.J.West was the architect and F.Osman was the contractor. Speeches at the laying ceremony were used to attempt to justify the expense of the building, criticise Southampton for polluting the Itchen, and express resistance to Southampton ever annexing Shirley. The report in the Hampshire Advertiser also describes the building which would include an upstairs boardroom 30 ft long by 25 ft wide, and downstairs offices for the clerk, surveyor, inspector of nuisances, and the collector (of revenues).\nA dinner to celebrate the opening of the new building was held on 12 January 1894.\nAfter the move, Ravenswood appears to have been used again by the Seventh-day Adventist church.\n\nThe Local Board became the Urban District Council in 1895 with the same membership. It dealt with similar issues, for example the 27 November meeting included a report about \"how Shirley and Freemantle are drained\" but actually about problems with the system. It was to become preoccupied with the question of \"Annexation\" by Southampton which had recently been raised in some detail at a special meeting of the former Local Board on 28 November 1894. The Hampshire Advertiser report of the first UDC meeting, held on 2 January 1895, ended with \"\"The 'Annexation' Scheme: At a special meeting of the Board, held on Saturday, it was resolved that one or two counsel be retained to represent the district at the forthcoming inquiry relative to the extension of the Southampton Borough boundaries.\"\" There was much concern about the impact of annexation on the rates, particularly given the incomplete state of mains water and drainage, but it was announced at 6 July meeting that these had been resolved. Subsequent UDC meetings were no less skeptical and the Hampshire advertiser reports continue to use the word \"annexation\" throughout.\n\nAs abolition approached, the 16 October 1895 meeting started late and was brief. The subsequent meeting reported on 26 October was even briefer and concludes with \"This was all the business\".\n\nIn the late 1800's the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway planned to build a railway through Shirley, to a new station near Southampton's Royal Pier. In the event the line was only built as far as Winchester Chesil Station. Deposited plans showed the line continuing South via Twyford, Chandlers Ford, Chilworth, Lordswood, the East side of Dale Valley, under Winchester Road, through land now occupied by Shirley Junior School and on to the East side of Hill Lane near Archers Road where there is a surviving (but never used) embankment to the North of Commercial Road. A story grew up that St James' Park, Southampton, in Shirley was to have been a local railway station (still repeated in books) but plans deposited with Hampshire Record Office for this and later versions of the same scheme show this not to have been the case, with the intended route of the railway passing to the North East. Although some land was purchased and work undertaken, the large depression in which St James Park sits was in fact caused by gravel extraction, although there are Didcot, Newbury and Stratton (formerly Station) Roads to the South of this park. Station Road did contain a Police Station at one time. Nothing came of this or later similar schemes which finally petered out prior to World War One.\n\nFrom 1879, a route of Southampton Corporation Tramways operated from Southampton via Fourposts Hill along Shirley High Street. Substantial further development was proposed in 1899. It ran until 1949 as far as what is now the current Shirley Precinct. This stop is still known as \"Shirley Terminus\" to some residents when using bus services. A large Tram depot was located in Carlisle Road, later being used as a bus depot until demolition in the 1980's.\n\nShirley is home to several schools including Upper Shirley High School (formerly Bellemoor Boys School), Richard Taunton Sixth Form College (the Hill Lane site was formerly the Girls' Grammar) and the 450-year-old King Edward VI School. The area is also served by Regents Park Community College (formerly Regents park Girls School). The Atherley School, founded in 1924, was in Hill Lane from 1926 to 1997.\n\nShirley has several infant and junior schools.\n\nSouthampton Old Cemetery is on the Shirley side of Southampton Common in Hill Lane. It was set out following an Act of Parliament passed in 1843.\n\nHollybrook Cemetery is notable for being the resting place of several famous individuals, including the 1966 World Cup winning footballer Alan Ball (1945–2007) and the comedian Benny Hill (1924–1992). It also contains the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's (CWGC) \"Hollybrook Memorial\" to 1,883 Commonwealth land and air force personnel who were lost at sea in World War I and have no known grave; those listed include Field Marshal Earl Kitchener and those of his military entourage who were lost on HMS \"Hampshire\" in 1916, and most of the South African Native Labour Corps personnel who were lost in the sinking of SS \"Mendi\" in 1917. \n\nThe CWGC also maintain and register graves within the cemetery of 113 Commonwealth service personnel of World War I, most of them in a war graves plot before the Memorial, and 186 from World War II, including three unidentified Merchant Navy seamen, besides 67 non-Commonwealth war graves, mostly German (two of them unidentified). It also contains the grave of Frederick Fleet, lookout of the RMS Titanic on the night of its loss in 1912. Fleet was buried in a pauper's grave which went unmarked until 1993, when a headstone bearing an engraving of the Titanic was erected through donations by the Titanic Historical Society.\n\n\n"}

Prince Yi Kang was not the Crown Prince, even though he was older than his brother Prince Imperial Yeong, due to the status of his mother.\n\nHe was only recognized as a legitimate prince with the name of Yi Kang and was titled Prince Uihwa with the style of \"Royal Highness\" in 1891, following a decree issued by his father. He married Lady Gim Sudeok, later known as the Princess Duk-in (22 December 1879 – 14 January 1964), a daughter of 1st Baron Gim Sajun.\n\nPrince Yi Kang was appointed special ambassador to the Empire of Japan for the celebration ceremonies for Japan's victory in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. The next year, he visited six European countries as an ambassador extraordinary: the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, Italy and Austria-Hungary. In 1899, he studied for a year at Keio University in Tokyo. He was promoted to the rank of Prince Imperial Eui, and styled \"His Imperial Highness\" the same year.\nIn 1900, he went to the United States and began studies at Roanoke College in Salem, Virginia from March 1901, where he majored in mathematics. After graduation, he spent a brief period at the Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio, and then travelled to San Francisco and Hawaii, returning to Korea in 1905. While in the United States, he scandalized the Korean government with his profligate spending and playboy lifestyle.\n\nPrince Yi Kang served as the president of the Korean Red Cross from 1906 to 1910.\n\nFollowing the abdication of King Gojong in 1907, and the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910 by which Korea was annexed to the Empire of Japan, Prince Yi Kang grew increasingly dissatisfied with his status, even though the Japanese provided him with a huge annual allowance.\n\nIn 1919, he collaborated with Choe Ik-hwan, a member of Daedongdan, who attempted to support him as the new leader of Korea. Prince Yi Kang then tried to escape to the Provisional Government of Korea based in Shanghai, which was only lukewarm to receiving him due to their republican sympathies. Prince Yi Kang was discovered in Dandong Manchuria and returned to his home country. After this, he cooperated and supported the Japanese government's occupation of Korea, and had continued this support until the end of the war.\n\nAfter the independence of Korea, he continued to live in Seoul, but in increasing poverty. On August 9, 1955 he was baptized a Roman Catholic, given the Christian name of Pius, and died a week later on August 15, 1955, at the age of 78, at Seongrak Manor, Seongbuk-dong, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, and is buried at Hongyu-reung in Namyang-ju near Seoul.\n\nPrince Yi Gang, a man with an active personality and handsome features, had 14 concubines in addition to his official wife, Princess Duk-in. He had a total of 12 sons and 9 daughters.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1933320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933320", "title": "Urea-formaldehyde", "text": "Urea-formaldehyde\n\nUrea-formaldehyde (UF), also known as urea-methanal, so named for its common synthesis pathway and overall structure, is a non-transparent thermosetting resin or polymer. It is produced from urea and formaldehyde. These resins are used in adhesives, finishes, particle board, medium-density fibreboard (MDF), and molded objects.\n\nUF and related amino resins are a class of thermosetting resins of which urea-formaldehyde resins make up 80% produced globally. Examples of amino resins use include in automobile tires to improve the bonding of rubber to tire cord, in paper for improving tear strength, in molding electrical devices, jar caps, etc.\n\nUrea-formaldehyde resin's attributes include high tensile strength, flexural modulus, and a high heat distortion temperature, low water absorption, mould shrinkage, high surface hardness, elongation at break, and volume resistance. It has a refractive index of 1.55.\n\nThe chemical structure of UF polymer consists of [(O)CNHCHNH] repeat units. In contrast melamine-formaldehyde resins feature NCHOCHN repeat units. Depending on the polymerization conditions, some branching can occur. Early stages in the reaction of formaldehyde and urea produce bis(hydroxymethyl)urea.\nApproximately 20 million metric tons of urea-formaldehyde are produced annually. Over 70% of this production is then put into use by the forest products industry for bonding particleboard, medium density fiberboard, hardwood plywood, and laminating adhesive.\n\nUrea-formaldehyde is pervasive. Examples include decorative laminates, textiles, paper, foundry sand molds, wrinkle resistant fabrics, cotton blends, rayon, corduroy, etc. It is also used to glue wood together. Urea formaldehyde was commonly used when producing electrical appliances casing (e.g. desk lamps). Foams have been used as artificial snow in movies.\n\nUrea formaldehyde is also used in agriculture as a slow release source of nitrogen. Urea formaldehyde's rate of decomposition into and is determined by the action of microbes found naturally in most soils. The activity of these microbes, and, therefore, the rate of nitrogen release, is temperature dependent. The optimum temperature for microbe activity is approximately 70-90 °F (approx 20-30 °C).\n\nUrea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) dates to the 1930s and made a synthetic insulation with R-values near 5.0 per inch. It is a foam, like shaving cream, that is easily injected or pumped into walls. It is made by using a pump set and hose with a mixing gun to mix the foaming agent, resin and compressed air. The fully expanded foam is pumped into areas in need of insulation. It becomes firm within minutes but cures within a week. UFFI is generally found in homes built before the 1970s, often in basements, crawl spaces, attics, and unfinished attics. Visually it looks like oozing liquid that has been hardened. Over time, it tends to vary in shades of butterscotch but new UFFI is a light yellow color. Early forms of UFFI tended to shrink significantly. Modern UF insulation with updated catalysts and foaming technology have reduced shrinkage to minimal levels (between 2-4%). The foam dries with a dull matte color with no shine. When cured, it often has a dry and crumbly texture.\n\nHealth effects occur when urea-formaldehyde based materials and products release formaldehyde into the air. Generally there are no observable health effects from formaldehyde when air concentrations are below 1.0 ppm. The onset of respiratory irritation and other health effects, and even increased cancer risk begins when air concentrations exceed 3.0-5.0 ppm. This triggers watery eyes, nose irritations, wheezing and coughing, fatigue, skin rash, severe allergic reactions, burning sensations in the eyes and throat, nausea, and difficulty in breathing in some humans (usually > 1.0 ppm). Occupants of UFFI insulated homes with elevated formaldehyde levels experienced systemic symptoms such as headache, malaise, insomnia, anorexia, and loss of libido. Irritation of the mucous membranes (specifically the eyes, nose, and throat) was a common upper respiratory tract symptom related to formaldehyde exposure. However, when compared to control groups, the frequency of symptoms did not exceed the controls except when it came to wheezing, difficult breathing, and a burning skin sensation. Controlled studies have suggested that tolerance to formaldehyde's odor and irritating effects can occur over a prolonged exposure. \n\nIt was first synthesized in 1884 by Hölzer, who was working with Bernhard Tollens. In 1919, Hanns John (1891–1942) of Prague, Czechoslovakia obtained the first patent for urea-formaldehyde resin.\n\nUrea-formaldehyde was object matter of judgment via the European Court of Justice (now CJEU) of 5 February 1963, Case 26-62 \"Van Gend & Loos v Netherlands Inland Revenue Administration\".\n\n\n"}

He represented both Merseyside rivals Everton and Liverpool in the Premier League.\n\nFrom his debut in 1993, Xavier played 20 games for the Portugal national team, and was selected in their squads for UEFA Euro 2000 and 2002 FIFA World Cup. He later became a manager for several Portuguese clubs and the Mozambique national team.\n\nXavier debuted in the Portuguese top division with Estrela da Amadora. His play there earned him a transfer to Lisbon club Benfica. He helped Benfica win the Portuguese league in 1994, and a season after, he moved to Serie A side Bari. This stint with the Italian club started a series of transfers across Europe: in 1996, Xavier was sent to Real Oviedo, then after two seasons he moved to PSV.\n\nXavier joined English Premier League club Everton in September 1999 on a £1.5 million transfer deal. He was sold to Everton's Merseyside rivals Liverpool on 30 January 2002 for £800,000. He was signed to bolster Liverpool's defence following Markus Babbel's absence through illness. Xavier scored on his Liverpool debut against Ipswich Town. He also scored against Bayer Leverkusen in the UEFA Champions League. Liverpool ended the 2001–02 FA Premier League season as runners-up to Arsenal.\n\nXavier started the first four league games of the 2002–03 FA Premier League season but later argued with Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and did not feature in any of the remaining games, though he did play in a League Cup tie against Ipswich in December. On 29 January 2003, he was loaned to Turkish side Galatasaray for the remainder of the season, with an option of a permanent move in the summer. Galatasaray did not take up the option to sign Xavier, who subsequently played for Hannover 96 (2003–04) and Roma in 2004–05.\n\nAt the start of the 2005–06 season, Xavier was without a club but at the end of August, he signed for Middlesbrough to replace Michael Reiziger after the Dutchman was sold to PSV.\n\nFollowing the UEFA Cup tie against Skoda Xanthi on 29 September, Xavier was administered a drugs test and failed. On 23 November 2005, he was found guilty of using the anabolic steroid methandrostenolone (also known as dianabol), and banned from professional football for 18 months. He said that the substance came from anti-virus medicine that he had imported from the United States. While other players had failed tests for recreational substances, Xavier became the first Premier League player to be found guilty of using performance-enhancing drugs. The suspension caused him to miss Middlesbrough's run to the 2006 UEFA Cup final. Xavier remained employed by the club and unsuccessfully appealed the decision; in January 2006 he said that he would take UEFA to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\n\nXavier's ban was shortened to 12 months in June 2006, making him eligible to play again from November 2006. In the summer of 2006, he began training again with Middlesbrough, and on 8 November 2006, was offered a contract with the club for the remainder of the 2006–07 season. He scored his first Boro goal on 20 January 2007 in a 5–1 win against Bolton Wanderers at the Riverside Stadium.\n\nOn 14 May 2007, it was announced that Xavier was to join the LA Galaxy of Major League Soccer (MLS). He played in his first game with the Galaxy on 17 June 2007 at home against Real Salt Lake, setting up fellow new signing Edson Buddle in a 3–2 win.\n\nXavier was waived by Los Angeles on 18 July 2008. Later, in an interview to an online football site, Xavier criticised Galaxy manager Ruud Gullit and the league itself. In December 2009, Xavier quit professional football.\n\nXavier was a part of the Portugal squad which came third at the 1989 FIFA U-16 World Championship in Scotland.\n\nXavier's full international debut for senior team came on 31 March 1993, away in Switzerland in qualification for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. He played three more matches in the unsuccessful qualification campaign that year and did not play for Portugal again until 1998.\n\nXavier was selected for UEFA Euro 2000 and became one of the key figures in the competition, not only due to playing some of his best football but also due to a distinctly bleached-blonde hairstyle with a matching beard. In the semi-final against France, he went from close to hero, as France goalkeeper Fabien Barthez blocked what looked a sure goal, to a villain, when he deflected a shot by Sylvain Wiltord near the post in the dying seconds of golden goal extra time with his hand. Zinedine Zidane scored the penalty and put France in the final. Xavier was initially given a nine-month ban from football for his vociferous protests against referee Günter Benkö's decision to award the penalty, but it was eventually reduced to six months. In the 2002 World Cup, he was part of the squad but played only as a substitute in the final group stage match against South Korea in his final of 20 international appearances.\n\nIn July 2013, Xavier signed to be manager of Portuguese top division club Olhanense for the upcoming 2013–14 Primeira Liga season. He was sacked by the club on 28 October 2013, despite beating Arouca in his last match to reach 11th in the table.\n\nIn December 2014, Xavier signed for another team from the Algarve, Farense of the Segunda Liga. He left his position on 28 May, after leading his team to the 11th position.\n\nIn July 2015, Xavier signed a one-year deal with another team in the second division, Desportivo das Aves. He was fired in early September after a series of poor results.\n\nOn 26 January 2016, he signed a two-year contract as coach of the Mozambique national team, starting work on 1 February. In December 2017, with his contract due to expire, he had it extended until the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. After conceding an added-time goal to Guinea, the Black Mambas missed out on the tournament in Egypt but he was assured of a new deal by the Mozambican Football Federation; this offer was rescinded after a poor performance at the 2019 COSAFA Cup in South Africa.\n\nXavier was born in Mozambique, which was then a Portuguese colony, and moved to Portugal as a child. He settled in Jamor in the western suburbs of Lisbon, where he lived in poverty. He grew up in a strict Catholic background. On retiring from his playing career, Xavier converted to Islam and changed his first name to Faisal.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2014, Xavier was in a relationship with actress Oceana Basílio. In February 2017, with debts of €1.5 million, bankruptcy proceedings were initiated against him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The name \"Obdam\" was then also spelled as \"Opdam\". British contemporaneous sources typically refer to him as \"Admiral Opdam\" or \"Lord Obdam\" because it was not until 1657 that he bought the Wassenaar Estate from relatives and thus acquired its title. Modern Dutch sources sometimes less correctly insert a second \"van\" between \"Wassenaer\" and \"Obdam\" or use the modern spelling \"Wassenaar\".\n\nJacob was born in 1610, the eldest son of Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Duivenvoorde, born 1574, and Anna van Randerode. After early military training, he joined the army and, in 1631, commanded a company of cavalry, soon rising to the rank of colonel. In this capacity, he took part in several sieges and was commended for his bravery fighting against the Spanish at the siege of Maastricht in 1632, and in 1643 he became \"drost\" (political governor) of Heusden, an important fortress town, and soon after military governor of its garrison.\n\nIn 1647, when the provinces of Gelderland and Overijssel proposed peace with Spain, Van Wassenaer was delegated by the majority of provinces that wished to continue the war in alliance with France to visit the two provinces, and he succeeded in convincing them to continue to fight. In 1648, in another mission on behalf, this time, of all the Netherlands provinces, he attended the baptism at Kleve of the eldest son of Frederick William of Brandenburg, and in 1651 he visited Frederick William at Dusseldorf to discuss a possible military alliance.\n\nOn 28 April 1633 at Maarssen he married Agnes Renesse van der Aa and had three children by her.\n\nAs a member of the nobility of Holland , van Wassenaer was delegated to the States of Holland to represent their interests as one of the ten members of the \"ridderschap\" (the \"knighthood\" Estate within the States). In 1650 when stadtholder William II of Orange died, he opposed installing the latter's infant son as nominal stadtholder. It is claimed that van Wassenaer bribed members of the nobility of other States by promising them positions in the army. His opposition to the House of Orange was based on socio-economic and religious grounds: the stadtholders had their political base in the artisan class, which consisted mainly of puritan Calvinists. Many members of the van Wassenaer family were still Catholic and feared religious oppression. When the First Anglo-Dutch War started in 1652 he, then a cavalry Colonel, was again delegated to the States-General. There he supported the faction of Johan de Witt and Cornelis de Graeff, which proposed to build a strong professional confederate fleet, at the expense of the army. Because his father had been Lieutenant-Admiral, and through the influence of de Witt, he was made \"Delegate of the States to the National Fleet\" , thereby becoming responsible for all day-to-day dealings between the States-General and the navy, a position that carried much power.\n\nNear the end of the war, in the Battle of Scheveningen, the supreme commander of the confederate Dutch fleet, Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp, was killed in action. His second in command had been Vice-Admiral Witte de With, both a courageous and competent sailor and a man seen as politically reliable as he was not a supporter of the Orangist faction. He would thus seem to have been the natural choice for a successor to Tromp. De With, however, also was a very brusque and quarrelsome man who had made himself profoundly disliked throughout the fleet, both by its commanders and by the ordinary seamen, to the extent that many of the former complained about him to de Witt and a few refused to serve under him, while there were desertions among the later. Third in command had been Vice-Admiral Johan Evertsen, a brave man and excellent sailor much admired by his men. However, Evertsen held his appointment from the Admiralty of Zeeland. As Holland was not only the richest Dutch province but the home of three of the five Dutch admiralties, including the two largest, its politicians and flag officers were not prepared to be subordinated to an admiral from one of the smaller Admiralties. He had also been a personal friend of the late stadtholder and was known to be a supporter of the plan to make his infant son stadtholder. Evertsen had also been accused by de With of cowardice when, during the Battle of Scheveningen he had withdrawn in his damaged ship rather than moving his flag to another vessel \n\nThe Admiralty of Amsterdam and the Admiralty of the Noorderkwartier both suggested Michiel de Ruyter even though his rank was only that of Commodore. De Witt took this recommendation seriously, but de Ruyter steadfastly declined to be considered for the post. As De With and Evertsen were not acceptable and De Ruyter had ruled himself out, De Witt turned to alternatives, without naval experience but with experience of command and the prestige of belonging to the Dutch nobility. The first candidate to be approached, Louis of Nassau-Beverweerd, an illegitimate son of Maurice, Prince of Orange and experienced military commander who had agreed to cooperate with the republican administration of Johan de Witt and the regents of the Dutch cities, becoming First Noble of Holland, declined but recommended his fellow noble, van Wassenaer. De Witt was also impressed by the performance of English army officers as Generals at Sea and, also influenced by the performance of earlier Dutch military men as sea officers, he finally proposed van Wassenaer, who was a political ally to take over command. Van Wassenaer at first refused, then made his acceptance conditional on his appointment as full Admiral, a post normally reserved for a Prince of Orange, not merely Lieutenant-Admiral. De Witt finally pressured him to accept by threatening to appoint a foreigner as Lieutenant-Admiral to command the Dutch fleet.\n\nIn 1654 the Dutch Navy found a new commander in Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam, Lieutenant-Admiral of Holland and West Frisia. He admitted to his lack of naval experience, and requested the appointment of a \"counsellor and assistant\"' to deal with naval tactics, while his own high rank, personal qualities and fighting reputation would allow him to prevent disputes between the various flag officers and captains. De Ruyter was persuaded to act as his counsellor after persuasion by de Witt. Van Wassenaer now had to solve the fundamental problem facing the Dutch fleet in that century: how to beat an enemy who was equipped with much more powerful ships. \n\nAlthough De Witt had convinced the States General to spend four million guilders in agreeing to building sixty new warships to augment the existing fleet in the First Anglo-Dutch War, including several comparable to the all but the largest English ships and much heavier than the average existing Dutch warship, many were relatively small convoy escorts, little more than frigates by English standards, and not all those planned had been completed or fitted out by 1665. At the start of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, as well as newer ships, Oddam's fleet included eighteen older warships that were reactivated after being laid up after the First Anglo-Dutch war, and several large Dutch East India Company built hybrid ships. These last could be used for carrying cargo, as convoy escorts or in battle, although they were not as strongly built as pure warships. \n\nBefore the Anglo-Dutch wars, the typical solution when fighting Spanish galleons had always been the direct attack having the weather gauge, using superior maneuverability and numbers, or if that failed: employing fireships and boarding. Against the English however this was generally unsuccessful; they were at least as competent in these aggressive tactics and they had too many ships. Maarten Tromp then tried an informal line of battle, but this ploy came back with a vengeance. Robert Blake created a very formal version that worked even better for the English as they had very powerful ships and a more professional navy; the Dutch had to employ many armed merchants.\n\nStudying Blake's \"Sailing and Fighting Instructions\" van Wassenaer saw a new solution to the old problem. Now that a professional Dutch Navy was being created, this navy would soon be the equal in competence of the British one. That left only the inequality in firepower to be solved. He understood that this could be achieved by abandoning the traditional aggressive stance and embracing defence. Sailing in a battle line in a defensive leeward position, the wind, blowing from the side of the enemy, would give the guns of the Dutch ships a higher elevation and therefore a better range. That same wind would decrease the range of the enemy ships or even force them to close the gun ports of their lower gun deck, the one that carried the heaviest guns. This became van Wassenaer's favorite method: to damage the enemy ships from a safe distance and then disengage. Whether the enemy was destroyed or his own fleet damaged too was immaterial as, with their superior shipbuilding capacity the Dutch could always make quicker repairs. Simply keeping the enemy fleet inoperational would suffice. Dutch trade wouldn't be disturbed and while a few battles might well deplete the enemy's treasury, the Republic would always have plenty of reserves. In van Wassenaer's opinion naval warfare was a gigantic battle of attrition that the Dutch were guaranteed to win\n\nIn 1655 Charles X of Sweden started a series of aggressive campaigns (part of the Northern Wars) intending to make Sweden the dominant power in the Baltic. The Dutch saw this as a threat to their vital interests. Although they are today better known for their exploitation of the East Indies, in fact, their Baltic trade was more profitable in absolute terms. Also, the Republic was critically dependent on Scandinavian wood to build ships and Polish grain to feed its large urban population.\n\nWhen Charles conquered Poland, Amsterdam under his regent Cornelis de Graeff supported the subsequent rebellion and sent Obdam with a fleet to relieve Danzig in 1656 In 1657 Van Wassenaer blockaded Lisbon and captured fifteen ships of a Portuguese sugar fleet, but in 1658 had to return to the Baltic as the situation there had grown even more critical. After the failure of his Polish campaign Charles had turned his attention on Denmark and had invaded Jutland from Germany. He then made peace with Frederick III of Denmark but treacherously broke it a few weeks later in an attempt to take Copenhagen by assault. This failed and he laid siege to the Danish capital, the last part of his kingdom still under Frederick's control. \n\nAfter much deliberation the States-General decided to send the entire active Dutch fleet and a mercenary army to relieve the Danes. On 8 November 1658 the Dutch defeated the heavier Swedish ships in the Battle of the Sound. During this battle, Witte de With who commanded the Dutch van was first to attack the Swedes, but his ship was boarded and he was killed, although his captured ship sank almost immediately. Van Wassenaer commanding the centre and the whole fleet in the Dutch flagship \"Eendragt\" attacked the Swedish commander, Gustaf Wrangel, and was in turn attacked and surrounded by several Swedish ships and only got clear after several dutch ships came to his aid. Much of the direction of the Dutch attack resulted from the tactical skill of Van Wassenaer's flag captain Egbert Bartholomeuszoon Kortenaer, whose presence was missed in later battles when he was promoted to flag rank. Van Wassenaer remained in command of the Dutch fleet during the winter of 1659. however, as the Swedes had been reinforced by a strong English fleet under Edward Montague giving this combined fleet superiority, ne remained largely inactive until reinforced by a squadron commanded by Vice-Admiral De Ruyter. In the summer of 1659, Obdam, de Ruyter and Johan Evertsen, either jointly or in separate squadrons assisted in the liberation of the Danish Isles, greatly assisted by the withdrawal of the English fleet. Van Wassenaer and most of the Dutch fleet left Danish waters in late October once this task had been almost completed, leaving De Ruyter with a small squadron until the terms peace was agreed.\n\nThe First and Second Anglo-Dutch wars arose from a combination of commercial and maritime rivalry religious and political differences between England and the Netherlands, although conceding that the Third Anglo-Dutch War was less the result of commercial rivalry. Although Oliver Cromwell wished to prevent any member of the House of Orange becoming stadtholder or holding other public office in the Netherlands, whereas after the English Restoration, Charles II of England became king, and tried to promote his nephew, the later William III of Orange as a possible stadtholder, both represented English interference in Dutch affairs. Although the Second Anglo-Dutch War resulted from long-standing commercial tensions between England and the Netherlands that had escalated from 1664 following English provocations in North America and West Africa., diplomatic negotiations to avoid the outbreak of war failed, largely because a group of ambitious English politicians and naval officers frustrated these efforts to reach any accommodation between the parties.\n\nThe war commenced with a declaration of war by the Dutch on 4 March 1665, which followed the provocation of English attacks on two Dutch convoys, one off Cadiz and the other in the English Channel. At the start of the war, both sides considered an early decisive battle was desirable, as English government finances could not sustain a long war, and an English blockade of Dutch ports and attacks on their merchant and fishing fleets would soon bring their economic ruin. After an early English blockade in April and May was broken off through its ships' lack of supplies, the Dutch were desperate to prevent a second blockade. The Grand Pensionary and leading Dutch politician, Johan de Witt and other members of the States-General, formed a commission to supervise Obdam, and gave him detailed instructions comprising 26 articles, ordering to attack the English aggressively when and where he could do them most damage. However, these instructions gave Obdam little guidance on how he should do so. \n\nThe same instructions issued by the commission headed by de Witt insisted on specifying that the Dutch fleet's order of battle should involve its division into a seven squadrons with a total of 21 flag officers for political reasons. Each of the five Dutch admiralties had its own set of flag officers, and each of the three smaller admiralties insisted on having its own squadron, so the larger the Admiralties of Amsterdam and the Maas then split their forces in two squadrons each. This resulted in seven squadrons, each with three flag officers; several were led by Lieutenant Admirals of equal rank to Van Wassenaer, who commanded his own squadron as well as the whole fleet. In addition, several squadrons had ships or flag officers from more than one admiralty, complicating their chain of command. \n\nAlthough van Wassenaer commanded what was the largest Dutch fleet up to that date, he was deeply unhappy with it, and in a meeting de Witt he pointed out that this fleet lacked any unity. As the Mediterranean Fleet had been sent to West Africa under de Ruyter, only half of the home fleet now consisted of professional ships; the remainder of disparate vessels either too old or too new and all poorly trained, manned by sailors from all over Scandinavia, Eastern Europe and Asia. Realising that his fleet was still too inferior in organisation, training, discipline and firepower to challenge the English successfully in a decisive battle, van Wassenaer was prepared only to seek a limited confrontation with his fleet in a defensive leeward position from which it could disengage quickly and return to its ports without openly disobeying orders. However, this opportunistic attitude and lack of a clear strategic plan was a significant cause of his defeat and death.\n\nVan Wassenaer took to sea and soon intercepted an English convoy from Hamburg, capturing nine merchant ships. De Witt sent letters to the fleet, but not to congratulate Van Wassenaer with his success but to instruct him to move away from the Dutch coast and attack the English fleet. On 11 June, an English ship sighted the Dutch fleet sailing west on a light breeze, but a turning tide and a near calm forced the English fleet to anchor, and the Dutch did not attack it, but avoided battle. Van Wassenaer had clear orders to fight and intended to do so, but not when an easterly breeze would prevent the Dutch fleet from retreating if it were outfought: his waiting for a westerly breeze may have saved the bulk of the Dutch fleet from destruction by allowing its withdrawal after battle. On 12 June the wind again blew from the east, and again Obdam declined to attack, despite holding the weather gage. The two fleets sailed westward for most of the day, but overnight the wind veered southerly, then southwesterly, in direction overnight and strengthened by dawn, so Van Wassenaer decided to attack.\n\nIt is impossible to know what Van Wassenaer's intentions were, as he did not survive the battle. He has been accused of lack both of leadership and tactical insight, and it is claimed he only succeeded in earlier battles when Egbert Bartholomeusz Kortenaer was his flag captain. Kortenaer had been promoted and, as a lieutenant-admiral at Lowestoft, so could no longer advise Van Wassenaer. However, Obdam's tactical decisions may relate to his appreciation that his out-gunned and poorly organised fleet could only succeed in battle under ideal conditions, and it needed to be able to disengage if it risked defeat. \n\nAlthough the Dutch fleet was able to withstand English attacks for several hours, it soon lost cohesion when trying to match the English fleet's manoeuvers, and several less enthusiastic captains and older ships failed to fight effectively in formation. In the afternoon the Dutch Fleet was trapped by the Blue squadron (or rear) of the English fleet. This Battle of Lowestoft turned into the worst naval defeat in Dutch history. The Dutch flagship \"Eendragt\" duelled her counterpart HMS \"Royal Charles\" and exploded. Van Wassenaer was not among the five survivors. One report stated that just before the explosion he was swept from the deck by an English cannonball fired across the ship.\n\nThe loss of the flagship and death of van Wassenaer, just as the English Blue and White squadrons were attacking, seriously affected Dutch morale, further damaged by the uncertainty over his successor. Egbert Kortenaer had been nominated to be Van Wassenaer's successor before the battle, but had been fatally wounded and was incapable of command. However, his flag captain kept Kortenaer's admiral's flag and, unnerved by the explosion of the \"Eendracht\", he fled the battle with many ships following what appeared to be their leader's flag. The next most senior admiral was Johan Evertsen of Zeeland then claimed that he commanded the fleet, but Cornelis Tromp, the senior Amsterdam officer also claimed to command, so three ships confusingly claimed to be fleet flagship.\n\nThe Dutch fleet had lost all cohesion by around 6pm, and only the actions Evertsen, Tromp and the few ships that continued fighting with them allowed other Dutch ships to gain a headstart on any English pursuit. But for them opposing the English fleet for two or three hours, many damaged Dutch ships would have been captured. The heavy defeat caused a national outrage. Trying to explain his commander's behavior captain Tjerk Hiddes de Vries, soon to be promoted to Lieutenant-Admiral of Frisia, wrote about the causes of the defeat: \"In the first place God Almighty robbed our supreme commander of his senses — or never gave him any to begin with.\"\n\nLike any Dutch Admiral killed in action Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam was given a marble grave memorial, in this case, of course, a cenotaph. It is in The Hague, in the Old Church. His son, also named Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam, was a military commander in the War of the Spanish Succession.\n\n"}

It is known informally as \"Jinnah House\", as it was built by Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, and remained his main residence for 10 years until he left in 1946 for Karachi.\n\nThe house was built by Jinnah in 1936 at a then exorbitant price of 2 Lakh (200,000) rupees. This was after Jinnah returned to Bombay from England to take charge of the Muslim League. The bungalow is located at 2, Bhausaheb Hirey Marg (formerly \nMount Pleasant Rd) in Malabar Hill, South Mumbai. It is situated near the current residence of the Chief Minister of Maharashtra. Jinnah lived in the house till Partition of India in 1947, after which he moved to Karachi in Pakistan. He also had a bungalow in Delhi on the erstwhile Aurangzeb road (now called APJ Kalam road) which has currently been leased to the Dutch consulate.\n\nDesigned by architect Claude Batley in the European-style architecture, the sea facing palatial bungalow was constructed using exquisite Italian marble and walnut woodwork. Specially imported Italian stonemasons were employed for its construction with Jinnah personally supervising the construction \"brick by brick\". The property encompasses an area of . The mansion, with its pointed arches and impressive columns, is currently in a dilapidated state, and much of the walnut panelling has rotted.\n\nDuring 1941, it was speculated that the house was to be sold to the Dalmia family for 20 Lakh rupees. Upon receiving a query by his daughter Dina Wadia on this, Jinnah himself dismissed this purported sale as \"wild rumour\".\n\nThe historic building was also the venue for the watershed talks on the Partition of India in September 1944 between Jinnah and Mahatma Gandhi. On 15 August 1946, exactly a year before India gained independence, another round of talks was held here between Jinnah and Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nCurrently the property is owned by the government of India. Dina Wadia, Jinnah's daughter who married an Indian and settled in India after the partition, had been involved in litigation regarding the house claiming that Hindu law is applicable to Jinnah as he was a Khoja Shia Muslim.\n\nJinnah was extremely attached to his house. After the partition of India in 1947, Mumbai remained a part of India and Jinnah left his abode as he became the Governor General of Pakistan. He requested Nehru, the then Indian Prime Minister to allot his house to any foreign consulate, preferably European, as he wished it to be given to a European family who would appreciate the architecture. Nehru acceded to Jinnah's request and offered him a monthly rent of three thousand rupees. Unfortunately, Jinnah died in September 1948 before the deal could be finalised.\n\nAs a personal favour to Jinnah, Nehru did not declare the property an Enemy Property. In 1955, in a Cabinet speech he suggested it be given to the Government of Pakistan, but could not gain the sanction of the Cabinet. Though India's Foreign minister and the Indian High Commission suggested that the mansion be handed over to Pakistan in 1956, the suggestion was not taken up.\n\nThe premises were leased to the British High Commission as the residence of the Deputy High Commissioner from 1948 to 1983. The first floor of the building also held the offices of senior Commission officials. It remained vacant until 2003, when a part of it was given to the Indian Council for Cultural Relations to be used for cultural activities. In March 2005, India's Minister of State for External Affairs, E. Ahamed reiterated that the house would remain a cultural centre.\n\nPakistan had since 1979 requested that India sell the property, or at least lease it to its government as a tribute to its founder in order to convert it into their Consulate. Though P. V. Narasimha Rao, India's foreign minister in 1980, agreed in principle to lease \"Jinnah House\" as the residence of local Consulate-General of Pakistan, the plan was never realised.\n\nDuring his visit to India, then Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf had suggested to the then Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee that the house be given to Pakistan so that it could be turned into a consulate. Talks in June 2004 between the foreign ministers of the two countries over the land did not gain any guarantees from India.\n\nIn May 2005, Pakistan High Commission officials were shown around various properties in Mumbai and its suburbs for the setting up of its consulate but not the Jinnah House. Indian government sources say that the claim by the Jinnah's heirs \"will be treated \"sympathetically\", and have no intention of handing it to Pakistan. \"\n\nDina Wadia, the only child of Jinnah, was involved in litigation regarding Jinnah House claiming that Hindu Law is applicable to Jinnah as he was a Khoja Shia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1933358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933358", "title": "States of Holland and West Friesland", "text": "States of Holland and West Friesland\n\nThe States of Holland and West Frisia () were the representation of the two Estates (\"standen\") (Nobility and Commons) to the court of the Count of Holland. After the United Provinces were formed — and there no longer was a count, but only his \"lieutenant\" (the stadtholder) — they continued to function as the government of the County of Holland.\n\nThe Nobility was normally represented by the Land's Advocate of Holland or Grand Pensionary of Holland, who combined the votes of the ten members of the \"Ridderschap\" (the \"Knighthood\") in the estates; the nobility was also supposed to represent all rural interest, including those of the farmers. The Commons consisted of representatives of eighteen cities, in ancient feudal order: eleven of the Southern Quarter: Dordrecht, Haarlem, Delft, Leyden, Amsterdam, Gouda, Rotterdam, Gorinchem, Schiedam, Schoonhoven and Brill; seven of the Northern West Frisian Quarter: Alkmaar, Hoorn, Enkhuizen, Edam, Monnikendam, Medemblik and Purmerend.\n\nMore powerful cities were allowed to send more representatives — Amsterdam had a delegation of four — but these then together had only one vote. All members of the States were appointed officials, including the Land's Advocate or Grand Pensionary, who was appointed by the States themselves. The Land's Advocate or Grand Pensionary was nearly always a previous pensionary of a city. Very important matters, such as about taxation, had to be decided on unanimously but normally decisions were made by majority. This majority was not reached after a voting procedure, but by a summary at the end of the meeting by the Land's Advocate or the Grand Pensionary of the opinions expressed by the several members present, who would speak according to the feudal order: Dordrecht first, Purmerend last. He had literally both the first — as representing the nobility vote — and the last say in a meeting. Since the death of Johan van Oldebarnevelt any Prince of Orange also being stadtholder indirectly had much power over the States. He had the right to appoint the mayors of all cities, out of one of two candidates suggested by the appointment college of a city. Mayors of cities with city rights chose the officials who served as representatives in the States of Holland. The States of Holland were disbanded during the reforms by the Batavian Republic.\n\nThe States of Holland should not be confused with the \"States-General\", or \"Staten-Generaal\", the confederate government of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands as a whole. Each of the Netherlands had its own \"States\" and Holland was just one of seven. Nevertheless, this province was so dominant that a politician controlling the States of Holland by being Land's Advocate of Holland or Grand Pensionary, in fact controlled the Republic. Johan de Witt is a case in point, and Johan van Oldebarnevelt another famous example.\n\nFirst mentioned in 1428, the States of Holland existed until 1795 when the Batavian Republic was established in the Batavian Revolution. The States of Holland were initially replaced by the Provisional Representatives of the People of Holland, which representative body also took the place of the States in the States General of the Batavian Republic.\n"}
{"id": "1933364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933364", "title": "Tolka Park", "text": "Tolka Park\n\nTolka Park () is an Irish football ground located in the north Dublin suburb of Drumcondra, on the northern banks of the River Tolka. It is currently the home ground of League of Ireland club Shelbourne. The stadium formerly held 9,680 people, but this has been scaled down in recent times due to health and safety regulations in the venue, mainly concerning the Ballybough and Riverside stands. Tolka Park has hosted national cup finals along with international matches, Champions League qualifiers, UEFA Cup, UEFA Cup Winners' Cup ties and was a venue for the 2000 Rugby League World Cup.\n\nIts future is currently uncertain due to the sale of the ground by Shelbourne to businessman Ossie Kilkenny in 2006.\n\nOver the years, seven different League of Ireland clubs have used Tolka Park for home league matches on a regular basis. They are Drumcondra, Shelbourne, Dolphin, Home Farm, Dublin City, Shamrock Rovers and St James Gate F.C..\n\nTolka Park was originally home to Drumcondra, who in the 1950s, and 1960s were one of the most popular teams in Dublin . In 1929, over 30 people were injured at the ground when a hoarding collapsed at a Drumcondra vs Shelbourne cup-tie. The ground hosted its first floodlit game on 30 March 1953. However \"Drums\" merged with local team Home Farm in 1972, and after the demise of Drumcondra, Home Farm moved into the ground. However, Home Farm never drew large crowds and Tolka fell into disrepair (though it did host the replay of the 1984 FAI Cup final).\n\nIn 1989, Shelbourne, who had played home games regularly in Tolka during the fifties, sixties, seventies, and early eighties, acquired Home Farm's long term lease from Dublin Corporation on the ground. Home Farm moved to their own ground in nearby Whitehall. Shelbourne invested heavily in the stadium, converting it into Ireland's first all-seater stadium and building a new stand behind the Drumcondra end goal in 1999.\n\nThe first ever League of Ireland match to be broadcast live on TV was a fixture between Shelbourne and Derry City, staged at Tolka Park during the 1996/97 season.\n\nHowever, Shelbourne FC ran into several severe problems that have put the future of Tolka Park in doubt. One problem was a flood in 2000 that caused extensive damage to the pitch and greatly increased the club's insurance costs. But a far more serious long-term problem was caused by the club's getting into severe debt through overspending on playing staff. In 2006, Ollie Byrne, Shelbourne Chief Executive sold the ground to property developer Ossie Kilkenny to help repay the club's debts. Shelbourne are still playing at the venue but its future is uncertain. Legal action between the parties who bought the ground delayed its demolition and development, as has a slowdown in the Irish property market. By 2011, the club were reporting that the ground was in need of maintenance.\n\nIn 1987, the then owners of Shamrock Rovers, the Kilcoyne family, attempted to move the club to Tolka Park. Rovers played there for a season, but the games were boycotted by their fans, who were trying to save Glenmalure Park from demolition.\n\nRovers returned to the ground in 1996 which they shared for a time with Shelbourne on and off (1996–1999, 2001–2002, 2004–2005 and 2006–2008) while Tallaght Stadium was being developed. They eventually moved into the Tallaght Stadium in 2009. Rovers' home tie against Sligo Rovers during the 2009 season was moved to Tolka Park amid safety concerns due to construction onsite at Tallaght before the club friendly against Real Madrid.\n\nTolka Park has staged two full internationals for the Republic of Ireland. Both matches were friendlies against Wales. The stadium hosted the first Setanta Cup Final when Linfield defeated Shelbourne. The Irish Rugby League Team have also played home games at the ground and hosted one game of the 2000 Rugby League World Cup with Ireland playing New Zealand Māori rugby league team the game ending 30–16 to Ireland. In recognition of the improvement made to stadium, a Republic of Ireland senior international match against Wales was played there in 1993, as were youth, League of Ireland XI and Republic of Ireland B games. From 1999 to 2002 it hosted the FAI Cup final, until the fixture was shifted to Lansdowne Road. Tolka hosted two games in the 2011 UEFA Regions' Cup.\n\nIn August 1938, September 1939 and April 1947 it held boxing championship bouts.\n\nThe Richmond Road Stand or Main Stand runs the length of the north side of the pitch. The Technical area is located at the stand as well as the Box office, Stadium Bar and First aid area. The stand is named after Richmond Road which is directly behind the stand.\n\nThe Riverside Stand runs the length of the south side of the pitch. Today it is mainly used for Broadcasting and seating Away fans. It is named after the River Tolka which is nearby.\n\nThe Drumcondra Stand or New Stand is located behind the goal at the west end of the ground and it is the most recent stand to open in the ground. The stand is named after the town of Drumcondra which is located behind the stand. The Ultras within the club's support base currently congregate in the Drumcondra Stand. The Drumcondra stand also houses the dressing rooms. The club shop is located beside the stand.\n\nThe Ballybough End is located behind the goal at the east end of the ground. It is named after the town of Ballybough which is located behind the stand. The Ballybough stand has become neglected over the years due to the decreased attendances of Shelbourne and was deemed unsafe and closed by the Dublin Fire Brigade Health and Safety Unit in 2010.\n\n\nSince the sale of Tolka Park in 2006, Shelbourne have been trying to relocate to a new ground. Plans for a new stadium in Finglas and Swords came to nothing, as has an FAI-backed proposed groundshare with North Dublin neighbours Bohemians. Plans were underway in March and April 2015 for the Council to take back ownership of the land, and for Shelbourne to groundshare Bohemians in (newly Council-owned) Dalymount Park. On 4 October 2016 Shelbourne announced that they would leave Tolka Park for a newly refurbished Dalymount Park.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1819. The name derives from the medieval use of the word philosophy to denote any research undertaken outside the fields of theology and medicine. The society was granted a royal charter by King William IV in 1832.\n\nThe society has published several scientific journals, including \"Biological Reviews\" (established 1926) and \"Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society\" (formerly entitled \"Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society\", published since 1843). \"Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society\" was published between 1821–1928, but was then discontinued.\n\nAs Cambridge's oldest scientific society founded in 1819, the society was founded by Adam Sedgwick and John Stevens Henslow. Its prime purpose is to \"keep alive the spirit of inquiry\". For almost 200 years, this spirit has been kept alive by its members and its activities. The society is independent of the University of Cambridge, although it is located within the Cambridge compound. The Society has provided an open forum and played a key role in raising the profile of the sciences to the public.\n\nMembers of the Society are called Fellows and are permitted to use the 'FCPS' post-nominal title. Fellows are usually academics or graduate students involved in mathematical or scientific research within the University. A Fellow must be recommended in writing by both a Fellow of the Society who has been a member for at least three years and a person of appropriate standing, who knows the candidate in a professional capacity. Approved candidates are elected at open meetings of the Society following proposal at Council Meetings.\n\nThe equivalent organisation for philosophers is the Cambridge Moral Sciences Club.\n\nThe society publishes one of the oldest mathematical journals in history, including the \"Mathematical Proceedings\" (1843) .

The championship was over 72 holes of medal play with 36 holes played each day. Entry was restricted to professionals born and resident in Scotland. The professionals also had to be either a member of the PGA or attached to a club. The residency rule excluded players like James Braid and Sandy Herd who were attached to English clubs. There were 44 entries. Prize money amounted to £70 of which £20 was provided by the Panmure Club. Prizes were given to the leading 6 players, the winner also receiving a gold medal. The scorer of the lowest round of the championship received £5.\n\nJohn Hunter and Robert Thomson led after the first day on 150 with 52-year-old Willie Fernie, the 1883 Open Champion next on 152.

It was nominated for the Nebula Award in 1972, and both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1973.\n\nThe novel's main character, David Selig, is an undistinguished man living in New York City. David was born with a telepathic gift allowing him to read minds. Rather than use his ability for any greater good, however, Selig squanders his power, using it only for his own convenience. At the beginning of the novel, David earns a living by reading the minds of college students so that he can better plagiarize reports and essays on their behalf.\n\nAs the novel progresses, Selig's power becomes continually weaker, working sporadically and sometimes not at all, and Selig struggles to maintain his grip on reality as he begins to lose an ability on which he has long since grown dependent.\n\nThe book contains a number of memorable elements, such as David's relationship with a fellow telepath he meets as a young adult, or his strained interaction with his estranged younger sister (who has long distrusted him because of his ability), or his obsession, during one section of the novel, with proving that his girlfriend, a woman named Kitty, is also telepathic after he discovers that he can't read her mind. There is also a moment where David's power causes him to vicariously experience his girlfriend's acid trip, and a bravura sequence in which the adolescent Selig, during a visit to a farm, enters the minds of, variously, a fish swimming in a stream, a hen laying an egg, and a young couple in the midst of passionate sex.\n\nMichael Dirda, reviewing the 2009 reissue in the \"Washington Post\", described \"Dying Inside\" as:... widely regarded as Robert Silverberg's masterpiece. ... It's insane that 'Dying Inside' should be subtly dismissed as merely a genre classic. This is a superb novel about a common human sorrow, that great shock of middle age -- the recognition that we are all dying inside and that all of us must face the eventual disappearance of the person we have been.\n\nTed Gioia at \"Conceptual Fiction\", wrote: Issues of aging and decline, maturity and grace--rarely dealt with in any popular fiction, and with a few exceptions (such as \"Flowers for Algernon\") almost completely neglected in sci-fi--are the key themes at work here. They are handled so deftly and vividly that one inevitably wonders about the connections between David Selig the character and Robert Silverberg the author.\nSilverberg has called it \"as mundane in texture as any novel I've ever written.\"\n\n\"Dying Inside\" makes frequent references to various artists, writers and other academics, including:\n\n\n"}

They cool into solid fragments before they reach the ground. Because volcanic bombs cool after they leave the volcano, they are extrusive igneous rocks. Volcanic bombs can be thrown many kilometres from an erupting vent, and often acquire aerodynamic shapes during their flight. Bombs can be extremely large; the 1935 eruption of Mount Asama in Japan expelled bombs measuring 5–6 m (16-20 ft) in diameter up to from the vent. Volcanic bombs are a significant volcanic hazard, and can cause severe injuries and death to people in an eruption zone. One such incident occurred at Galeras volcano in Colombia in 1993; six people near the summit were killed and several seriously injured by lava bombs when the volcano erupted unexpectedly. On July 16, 2018, 23 people were injured on a tour boat near the Kilauea volcano as a result of a basketball-sized lava bomb from the 2018 lower Puna eruption.\n\nVolcanic bombs are known to occasionally explode from internal gas pressure as they cool, but in most cases, most of the damage they cause is from impact, or subsequent fire damage. Bomb explosions are most often observed in \"bread-crust\" type bombs.\n\nBombs are named according to their shape, which is determined by the fluidity of the magma from which they are formed. \n\n"}

{"id": "1933452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933452", "title": "Notodontidae", "text": "Notodontidae\n\nNotodontidae is a family of moths with approximately 3,800 known species. The family was described by James Francis Stephens in 1829. Moths of this family are found in all parts of the world, but they are most concentrated in tropical areas, especially in the New World (Miller, 1992). The Thaumetopoeidae (processionary moths) are sometimes included here as a subfamily.\n\nSpecies of this family tend to be heavy-bodied and long-winged, the wings held folded across the back of the body at rest. They rarely display any bright colours, usually being mainly grey or brown, with the exception of the subfamily Dioptinae (Grimaldi and Engel, 2005). These features mean they rather resemble Noctuidae although the families are not closely related. The adults do not feed. Many species have a tuft of hair on the trailing edge of the forewing which protrudes upwards at rest. This gives them their scientific name \"back tooth\" and the common name of prominents. The common names of some other species reflect their hairiness, such as puss moth and the group commonly known as kittens (\"Furcula\" spp.), so named as they resemble small versions of the puss moth.\n\nThe egg is hemispherical or almost spherical, and lacks any ribs (Scoble, 1995).\n\nThe caterpillars are usually hairless, but may have tubercules, spines, or humps (Scoble 1995), and often rest with both ends raised. The last set of prolegs is frequently vestigial, or may be long, with glands that can be everted. Some larvae undergo shape modification and colour changes with each instar (Weller, 1992). Notodontid larvae are notable for their often bizarre shapes, and some have chemical defences (cyanic acid, formic acid, and other ketones: Blum, 1981) not commonly found in other Lepidoptera (Weller 1992). \"Schizura unicornis\" and \"S. badia\" have a mixture of formic acid, acetic acid and other compounds which they spray accurately at their attacker (Attygalle et al., 1993).\n\nThe larvae of some species are truly extraordinary: That of the puss moth has a fearsome-looking \"face\" and two long whip-like \"tails\" (actually highly modified prolegs) and it rears both ends in a threatening display when disturbed. The larva of the lobster moth is even more remarkable, resembling a crustacean. Others, such as \"Cerura vinula\"\nmimic the edge of a leaf that has been damaged and is turning brown (they rest and feed along the edge of the leaf).\n\nMost are solitary feeders, but some are gregarious, and this is most common in the processionary moths, Thaumetopoeinae.\n\nThey feed on trees and shrubs, except in the subfamily Dioptinae, which feed on herbaceous plants (Miller, 1992). The larvae typically feed on only one family of trees, but closely related species will feed on distantly related plants; for example different members of the genus \"Datana\" feed on Juglandaceae, Hamamelidaceae, Ericaceae and Anacardiaceae (Miller 1992).\n\nAdults have tympanal organs on the metathorax that opens towards the top, and the tibial spurs have serrated edges (Scoble, 1995). Mouthparts vary from well-developed to absent. The Dioptinae, which was formerly considered a separate family, are colourful and fly by day, while the rest of the notodontids are nocturnal. Some of these Dioptinae have non-functional tympanal hearing organs which are normally defensive against bats (Fullard et al., 1997).\n\nSome notodontids cause noticeable defoliation of their hosts. Well-known defoliators include: the saddled prominent (\"Heterocampa guttivita\"), poplar defoliator (\"Clostera cupreata\"), California oakworm (\"Phryganidia californica\"), the beech caterpillar, (\"Quadricalcarifera punctatella\"), variable oakleaf caterpillar (\"Lochmaeus manteo\"), \"Epicerura pergisea\", yellownecked caterpillars (\"Datana ministra\"), and walnut caterpillar (\"Datana integerrima\"), among others.\n\nNotable species are:\n\n\nSome subfamily genera:\n\nApart from the subfamilies listed in the two places above, there are numerous notodontid genera of uncertain relationships.

Upon receiving his inheritance she founded The Hotchkiss School, a private boarding school in Lakeville, Connecticut, in 1891.\n\nMaria Harrison Bissell was born on August 14, 1827 in Salisbury, Connecticut. Her father was William Bissell (1794-1869), and her mother was Eliza Ann Loveland (1800-1841). She grew up of slender means on a farm in Salisbury named \"Tory Hill\" with her two brothers, William Loveland Bissell (1833-1922) and Charles H. Bissell (1829-1928). The family was related to Presidents William Henry Harrison and Benjamin Harrison. Educated at Amenia Academy in Amenia, New York, she went on to work as a teacher there.\n\nIn 1850 she married Benjamin B. Hotchkiss, a Connecticut born gun maker. \nBy the time of the American Civil War he had become a noted munitions developer. Hotchkiss patented a line of projectiles for rifled artillery that was used extensively during that conflict.\n\nWhen the U.S. government showed little interest in funding new weapons after the war Hotchkiss moved to France in 1867 - without Maria. There he set up a munitions factory, Hotchkiss et Cie, which went on to develop the renowned revolving barrel artillery piece known as the Hotchkiss gun.\n\nBenjamin Hotchkiss died young, at 58, in February 1885. Upon receiving her husband's inheritance, Maria considered macadamizing the streets of Salisbury and Sharon, Connecticut for use by automobiles. However, the idea was rejected by both towns, which thought the upkeep would be too expensive. Instead, she was convinced by Timothy Dwight V, the President of Yale University, to start a preparatory school. In 1891 she donated the land, buildings, and the endowment to found the Hotchkiss School, a private boarding school in Lakeville. The school purchased \"Tory Hill,\" the farm where Mrs. Hotchkiss was born and spent her childhood, in 2010.\n\nIn 1893, she founded the Hotchkiss Library in Sharon, Connecticut, helping to choose its architectural design.\n\nMaria married Benjamin B. Hotchkiss on 27 May 1850. However, he permanently moved to France in 1867, subsequently marrying a Miss Cunningham from New York in a French civil ceremony without first divorcing. Later, Maria resided at the Plaza Hotel in New York City.\n\nShe died on November 10, 1901, in New York City. She was buried in Lakeville with her Bissell relatives in the Town Hill Cemetery, which lies within the campus of The Hotchkiss School.\n"}

After including a female sexual fantasy in a novel she submitted for publishing, her editor objected, and Friday shelved the novel. After other women began writing and talking about sex publicly, Friday began thinking about writing a book about female sexual fantasies, first collecting fantasies from her friends, and then advertising in newspapers and magazines for more. She organized these narratives into \"rooms\", and each is identified by the woman's first name, except for the last chapter, \"odd notes\", which is presented as the \"fleeting thoughts\" of many anonymous women.

It is the administrative headquarters of Mandla District. The town is situated in a loop of the Narmada River, which surrounds it on three sides, and for 15 miles between Mandla and Ramnagar, Madhya Pradesh the river flows in a deep bed unbroken by rocks. The Narmada is worshiped here, and many ghats have been constructed on the banks of the river.\nIt was a capital of the Gondwana Kingdom who built a palace and a fort, which in the absence of proper care have gone to ruins.\n\nWriters such as Alexander Cunningham, John Faithfull Fleet, Moti Raven Kangali, Girija Shankar Agrawal and brajesh mishra identify Mandla as the location of ancient Mahishmati.\n\nGondwana queen, Rani Durgavati shah Maravi ruled Mandla province and fought against Akbar in her valiant effort to save her kingdom; which is still subject to folklore. Rani Avantibai of Ramgarh later fought with the British to save her kingdom from annexation.\n\nThe Gondwana dynasty of Garha Kingdom commenced, according to an inscription in the palace of Ramnagar, in the fifth century, with the accession of Jadho Rai, an adventurer who entered the service of an old Gond king, married his daughter and succeeded him to the throne. Alexander Cunningham placed the date two centuries later in 664. The Garha-Mandla kingdom was a petty local chiefship until the accession of Raje Sangram Shah Madawi, the forty-seventh king, in 1480. This prince extended his dominions over the Narmada Valley, and possibly Bhopal, Sagar, and Damoh and most of the Satpura hill country, and left fifty-two forts or districts to his son. In addition to Mandla, Jabalpur and Garha in Jabalpur District and Ramnagar in Mandla District served at times as capitals of the kingdom.\n\nThe control of the Garha-Mandla kings over their extended principality was, however, short-lived, for in 1564 Asaf Khan, the Mughal viceroy, invaded their territories. The queen Durgavati, then acting as regent for her infant son, met him near Singorgarh fort in Damoh District; but being defeated, she retired past Garha towards Mandla, and took up a strong position in a narrow defile. Here, mounted on an elephant, she bravely headed her troops in defense of the pass, and notwithstanding that she had received an arrow-wound in her eye refused to retire. But by an extraordinary coincidence the river in the rear of her position, which had been nearly dry a few hours before the action commenced, began suddenly to rise and soon became unfordable Finding her plan of retreat thus frustrated, and seeing her troops give way, the queen snatched a dagger from her elephant-driver and plunged it into her breast. Asaf Khan acquired immense booty, including, it is said, more than a thousand elephants.\n\nFrom this time the fortunes of the Mandla kingdom rapidly declined. The districts afterward formed into the state of Bhopal were ceded to the Emperor Akbar, to obtain his recognition of the next Rajja, Chandra Sah. In the time of Chandra Sah's grandson, Prem Narayan, the Bundelas invaded Narsinghpur District and stormed the castle of Chauragarh. During the succeeding reigns, family quarrels led the rival parties to solicit foreign intervention in support of their pretensions, and for this a price always had to be paid. Mandla was made capital of the kingdom in 1670. Part of Sagar District was ceded to the Mughal Emperor, the south of Sagar and Damoh districts to Chhatar Sal Raja of Panna, and Seoni District to the Gond Raja of Deogarh.\n\nIn 1742 the Peshwa invaded Mandla, and this was followed by the exaction of \"chauth\" (tribute). The Bhonsles of Nagpur annexed the territories now constituting Balaghat District and part of Bhandara District. Finally, in 1781, the last king of the Gondwana line was deposed, and Mandla was annexed to the Maratha government of Sagar, then under the control of the Peshwa.\n\nAt some period of the Gondwana kingdom the district must have been comparatively well-populated, as numerous remains of villages could be observed in places that, by the early 20th century, were covered in forest; but one of the Sagar rulers, Vasudeo Pandit, is said to have extorted several tens of thousands of rupees from the people in 18 months by unbridled oppression, and to have left the district ruined and depopulated. In 1799 Mandla was appropriated by the Bhonsle rajas of Nagpur, in accordance with a treaty concluded some years previously with the Peshwa. The Marathas built a wall on the side of the town that was not protected by the river. During the 18 years which followed, the district was repeatedly overrun by the Pindaris, although they did not succeed in taking the town of Mandla.\n\nIn 1818, at the conclusion of the Third Anglo-Maratha War, Mandla was ceded to the British. The Maratha garrison in the fort refused to surrender, and a force under General Marshall took it by assault. Mandla and the surrounding district became part of the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories of British India. The peace of the district was not subsequently disturbed, except for a brief period during the Revolt of 1857, when the chiefs of Ramgarh, Shahpura, and Sohagpur joined the rebels, taking with them their Gond retainers. British control was restored in early 1858. The Saugor and Nerbudda Territories, including Mandla District, became part of the new Central Provinces in 1861. The town was made a municipality in 1867. The Maratha wall was removed in the early 20th century. By the first decade of the 20th century, Mandla contained an English middle school, girls' and branch schools, and a private Sanskrit school, as well as three dispensaries, including mission and police hospitals, and a veterinary dispensary. A station of the Church Missionary Society was also established there.\n\n India census, Mandla had a population of 71,579. Males constitute 51% of the population and females 49%. In 2011 Mandla has an average literacy rate of 68.3%, higher than the national average of 59.85%: male literacy is 79.5%, and female literacy is 57.2%.

In Mandla, 13.7% of the population is under 6 years of age.90% of population are Hindus,4% Christians, 5% Muslims and rest counts for Buddhists, Jains and others.\n\nMandla is connected by road to nearby cities like Jabalpur, Nagpur and Raipur through National Highway 12A (Express highway). From Jabalpur to Mandla, it takes more than 04 hours by bus (96 km approx.) as the road condition is very poor. Earlier Mandla has been connected by Indian Railway's Narrow Gauge Track via Nainpur to Jabalpur, Gondia,Chhindwara. Now Mandla is to be connected by Indian railway Broad gauge Track as work is in Progress. Traveler can travel by train from Chiraidongri to Jabalpur via Nainpur, as Broad Gauge track work is complete there.\n\nMandla has various places of tourist attraction which include wildlife, ancient forts, temples and springs.

The Garam Pani Kund situated 18 km from Mandla city is known for its sulphur abundant water well. Locals believe that water of well was blessed by god Vishnu to cure the people suffered by plague spread in past. Apart from magical water, this place is surrounded with evergreen flora. Indian council of medical research (ICMR) concluded that water in well can cure various skin disease. The Ramnagar Fort / Mandla Fort was built in the late 17th century by the Gond Kings. It is constructed in a loop of the Narmada River. The main feature of this fort is its three- storey strategic construction. It was built on the banks of the Narmada river so that the river forms its defence from three sides. This fort is also known as Moti Mahal situated 24 km from Mandla city. Another fort, Begum Mahal is situated 3 km away from Moti Mahal is known for its three storyed rectangular masterpiece of mugal architecture which was built for Chimney Rani. The marvellous black stones used to build Begum Mahal were taken from another spot of attraction, \"Kala Pahad\" situated 4 km from it. The Main Market of Mandla is known for its hand-craft goods.

He was happiest directing chaotic musicals on the tiny stage of the old Theatre Royal Stratford East, Theatre Workshop's home in Stratford, London, for many years but he also had hits in the West End and abroad, among them \"The Invisible Man\" and the original stage version of \"Phantom of the Opera\", which inspired Andrew Lloyd Webber to create his musical blockbuster of the same title.\n\nKen Hill was born in Birmingham, England on 28 January 1937 and was educated at King Edward VI's Grammar School, Camp Hill, Birmingham, after which he joined an amateur theatrical company, Crescent Theatre, sweeping the floor, making props, writing and directing. His first play, \"Night Season\", was put on at the Alexandra Theatre, Birmingham, in 1963. For a time he worked as an investigative journalist for ATV and it was there that he caused a minor uproar with his report on corruption in Birmingham's local government.\n\nIn 1970, Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop returned to its old home, the dilapidated Theatre Royal Stratford East. A satire on local authorities was discussed as a good subject for a new production, and Hill's name was put forward as a possible writer. The result of the collaboration Hill's \"Forward Up Your End\" (1970) was condemned by some of the press for its juvenile humour but Joan Littlewood liked it and Hill stayed on.\n\nHe was roped in as an actor in numerous productions but writing, not acting, remained his first love. He was made associate director and resident writer at Theatre Workshop from 1970 to 1974 and from 1974 to 1976 he took over as artistic director, Joan Littlewood by this time having left for projects in Tunisia.\n\nHill's productions there included \"Is Your Doctor Really Necessary?\" (1973), a collaboration with hit songwriter Tony Macaulay, \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" (1974), \"Gentlemen Prefer Anything\" (1974) and \"Dracula\" (1974). He then became artistic director of the Musical Theatre Company, directing for the West End: \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\" at the Westminster Theatre (for Andrew Lloyd Webber), \"The Mikado\", and \"Fiddler on the Roof\". Other West End credits include playdoctoring productions of \"Drake's Dream\" and \"Wren\".\n\nShortly after, he was commissioned by the National Theatre for a version of \"The Hunchback Of Notre Dame\". He then wrote and directed for television: \"All the Fun of the Fair\" – in the course of his life, Hill wrote over 100 scripts for various television programmes. His other commissions for various theatres include: \"The Curse of the Werewolf\", \"The Mummy's Tomb\", \"Mafeking\", \"The Three Musketeers\", \"Bel Ami\", \"The Living Dead\", and a new translation of Jacques Offenbach's \"La Vie parisienne\". Hill was also commissioned for productions of \"\", \"Little Shop of Horrors\", and a \"Narnia\" trilogy. He also adapted and directed two books by Catherine Cookson and completed a third for the Birmingham Repertory Theatre.\n\nHe left Theatre Workshop in 1976 and worked for some years as the Director of Productions at the Newcastle Playhouse. That same year, he first staged his version of \"Phantom of the Opera\" at the Duke's Playhouse in Lancaster (and also on Morecambe Pier). In 1983, he adapted Catherine Cookson's \"\" into an elaborate stage musical for the Playhouse with songs by Eric Boswell. In 1984, an updated version of \"Phantom of the Opera\" was revived and produced in a joint-production with the Newcastle Playhouse and the Theatre Royal Stratford East. Andrew Lloyd Webber saw and liked it, and for a while there was talk about his bringing it into the West End. Nothing came of this, however, and Lloyd Webber's own version duly opened in the West End in 1986. Hill's \"Phantom\" went abroad to St. Louis in the United States in 1987 and also had another major production in San Francisco in 1988. The musical then embarked on a two-year-long national tour of the US from 1989 to 1991. The show also transferred to the West End in 1991 but, despite excellent notices, did badly at the box office and was forced to close earlier than expected. Since then, \"Phantom of the Opera\" has arguably become one of his most famous works, and has toured the world – the most recent production was in Tokyo, Japan in November 2004.\n\n\"The Invisible Man\", with illusions by the magician, Paul Kieve, fared much better in the West End, transferring from Stratford East to the Vaudeville Theatre in 1993. This show was a particular favourite of Hill's, combining his love of stage trickery and childish optical jokes in scenes in which, for instance, the unbandaged 'invisible' head of the Invisible Man smokes a cigar. Hill made everyone working in the theatre, from the cleaning staff upwards, sign a document forbidding them to reveal how this was done to the press.\n\nDespite having cancer intermittently for 12 years, Hill still continued to deluge Stratford East with ideas for new productions right up until his death from his cancer on 23 January 1995 aged 57, and only five days before his 58th birthday. He died just two weeks before the opening of what was his final production, \"Zorro The Musical!\", which he directed. \"Zorro\" opened on 14 February 1995, to rave reviews and immense box office success.\n\nThe Ken Hill Memorial Trust was set up after Hill died in 1995, to aid the Theatre Royal in supporting new talent in musical theatre. It now offers a biennial Musical Theatre Award annually to help nurture new talent in theatrical writers. The award in 1997 was a total of £5,000 for the winner – £1000 in cash, with the balance going towards the production costs of a week's showcase at the Theatre Royal, where many of Ken Hill's works were premiered. In addition, royalties were paid to the writer for the showcase. The trustees also offered small cash prizes to five runners up. There is now news as to whether this trust or award still exists today or not.\n\nThere are also \"Ken Hill awards\" for new talented playwrights and for the Best New Musical.\n\nSome of Hill's plays, \"The Invisible Man\", \"The Curse of the Werewolf (play)\", \"The Mummy's Tomb\" and his version of \"The Phantom of the Opera\", are available to purchase from Samuel French Ltd. in London. The rights to produce these shows can also be obtained by theatre groups, professional and amateur, who wish to perform them.\n\n"}

In 1232, he was elected Grand Master of the Templars. He organized attacks on Cana, Safita, Sephoria and Praetoria, and against the Muslim positions around the Sea of Galilee. All of these expeditions were failures and diminished the Templars' effectiveness.\n\nIn 1236, on the border between Syria and Cilicia, 120 knights, along with some archers and Turcopoles, were ambushed near the town of Darbsâk (Terbezek). In the first phase of the battle, the Templars reached the town but they met fierce resistance. When reinforcements from Aleppo arrived, the Templars were massacred. Fewer than twenty of them returned to their castle in Bagras, fifteen km from the battle.\n\nIn September 1239, Armand arrived at Acre. He made a treaty with Sultan of Damascus, in parallel with the Hospitaller treaty with the Sultan of Egypt. In 1244 the Sultan of Damascus demanded that the Templars help repel the Khwarezmians from Asia Minor. In October 1244, the Templars, Hospitallers and Teutonic Knights, together with the Sultan of Damascus, confronted the Sultan of Egypt and his Khwarezmian allies at the Battle of La Forbie. The Christian-Muslim coalition was defeated, with more than 30,000 deaths. Some Templars and Hospitallers reached Ascalon, still in Christian hands.

His period as Minister of Transport was controversial. He both oversaw significant road construction (he opened the first section of the M1 motorway) and the closure of a considerable portion of the national railway network with the Beeching cuts. His involvement in the road construction business Marples Ridgway, of which he had been managing director, was one of repeated concern regarding possible conflict of interest. Marples appointed Richard Beeching to head British Railways, who published a report which abandoned more than 4,000 miles of railway lines in the UK with a resulting rise in the amount of road traffic.\n\nIn later life, Marples was elevated to the peerage before fleeing to Monaco at very short notice to avoid prosecution for tax fraud.\n\nMarples was born at 45 Dorset Road, Levenshulme, Manchester, Lancashire. His father had been a renowned engineering charge-hand and Manchester Labour campaigner, and his mother had worked in a local hat factory. Marples attended Victoria Park Council School and won a scholarship to Stretford Grammar School. By the age of 14 he was already active in the Labour Movement, as well as earning money by selling cigarettes and sweets to Manchester football crowds. He also played football for a YMCA team.\n\nMarples worked as a miner, a postman, a chef and an accountant. He was commissioned into the Royal Artillery in 1941, rose to the rank of captain and was medically discharged in 1944.\n\nIn 1937 Marples married Edna Florence Harwood, the daughter of a Nottingham businessman. This marriage was dissolved in 1945.\n\nIn 1956 Marples married his former secretary Ruth Dobson (1919–2014), who on his elevation to the peerage in 1974 became Lady Marples.\n\nMarples joined the Conservative Party and in 1945 was elected as Member of Parliament for Wallasey. In 1951, Winston Churchill appointed him a junior minister in the Conservative Government 1951–1955. Marples was a minister under Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home throughout the Conservative Government 1957–1964.\n\nIn 1957, Harold Macmillan appointed Marples Postmaster General. On 2 June 1957, Marples started the first draw for the new Premium Bond scheme. At that time the telephone network was controlled by the General Post Office, and saw the introduction of subscriber trunk dialling (STD), which eliminated the use of operators on national phone calls, and it has also been claimed that he introduced the first postcodes to the UK, although these were both actually technical innovations which would probably have been inevitable regardless of the presiding politician.\n\nMarples was Minister of Transport from 14 October 1959 until the Conservatives lost the 1964 general election on 16 October 1964.\n\nAs Minister of Transport, Marples oversaw the introduction of parking meters and the provisional driving licence in 1958, panda crossings in 1962 and two Transport Acts. The Road Traffic Act of 1960 introduced the MOT test, roadside single yellow lines and double yellow lines, traffic wardens, and the 250 cc engine limit for learner motorcyclists.\n\nThe Transport Act 1962 dissolved the British Transport Commission (BTC) which had overseen the railways, canals and road freight transport and established the British Railways Board; it also put in place measures which simplified the process of closing railways. The Act was described as the \"most momentous piece of legislation in the field of railway law to have been enacted since the Railway and Canal Traffic Act 1854\".\n\nIn anticipation of the 1962 Act, the government appointed Dr Richard Beeching as Chairman of the British Railways Board with a brief to recommend and implement such changes as were necessary to end the losses that were growing rapidly at the time. The Beeching cuts, or \"Beeching Axe\" that followed resulted in the major closures for both stations and lines. It may not be entirely a coincidence that as Beeching was closing railway lines, the government was providing funding for the construction of motorways, which were being built by companies in which Marples had an interest (see below).\n\nMarples retired from the House of Commons at the February 1974 general election. On 8 May 1974 he was made a life peer as \"Baron Marples\" of Wallasey in the County of Merseyside.\n\nIn the late 1940s Marples was a director of a company called Kirk & Kirk, which was a contractor in the construction of Brunswick Wharf Power Station at Blackwall in London. Marples met civil engineer Reginald Ridgway (1908–2002), who was working as a contractor for Kirk & Kirk. In 1948 the two men founded Marples Ridgway and Partners, a civil engineering company that started with one five-ton ex-army truck and one crane.\n\nThe new partnership took over Kirk & Kirk's contract at Brunswick Wharf and in 1950 Marples severed his links with Kirk & Kirk. Marples Ridgway's subsequent contracts included building power stations in England, the Allt na Lairige dam in Scotland, roads in Ethiopia and (significantly) England, and a port in Jamaica. The Bath and Portland Group took over Marples Ridgway in 1964.\n\nShortly after he became a junior minister in November 1951, Marples resigned as managing director of Marples Ridgway but continued to hold some 80% of the firm's shares. When he was made Minister of Transport in October 1959, Marples undertook to sell his shareholding in the company as he was now in clear breach of the House of Commons' rules on conflicts of interest. He had not done so by January 1960, at which time the \"Evening Standard\" reported that Marples Ridgway had won the tender to build the Hammersmith Flyover and that the Ministry of Transport's engineers had endorsed the London County Council's rejection of a lower tender.\n\nMarples' first attempt to sell his shares was blocked by the Attorney-General on the basis that he was using his former business partner, Reg Ridgway, as an agent to ensure that he could buy back the shares upon leaving office. Marples therefore sold his shares to his wife, reserving himself the possibility to reacquire them at the original price after leaving office; by this time, his shares had come to be worth between £350,000 and £400,000.\n\nIn 1959, shortly after becoming minister, Marples opened the first section of the M1 motorway. It is now understood that although his company was not directly contracted to build the M1, Marples Ridgway \"certainly had a finger in the pie\". Marples Ridgway built the Hammersmith flyover in London at a cost of £1.3 million, immediately followed by building the Chiswick flyover.\n\nMarples Ridgway was also involved in other major road projects in the 1950s and 1960s including the £4.1 million extension of the M1 into London, referred to as the Hendon Urban Motorway at the time.\n\nWhen Lord Denning made his 1963 investigation into the security aspects of the Profumo affair and the rumoured affair between the Minister of Defence, Duncan Sandys, and the Duchess of Argyll, he confirmed to Macmillan that a rumour that Ernest Marples was in the habit of using prostitutes appeared to be true. In early 2020, the rumours were corroborated by broadcaster and investigative journalist Tom Mangold, based on the diaries of Lord Denning's then-secretary, Thomas Critchley. The diaries reported the transport minister's fetish for being whipped while dressed in women's clothing, as described in great detail by one of the prostitutes who had provided these services to Marples, and confirmed at the time by her detailed knowledge of the interior of Marples' home where the events took place. The story was suppressed and did not appear in Denning's final report.\n\nEarly in 1975 Marples suddenly fled to Monte Carlo. He left just before the end of the tax year, fearing that he would otherwise be liable for a substantial tax bill.\n\nAmong the journalists who investigated his unexpected flight was Richard Stott (later editor of the \"Daily Mirror\"):\nIn the early 70s ... he tried to fight off a revaluation of his assets which would undoubtedly cost him dear ... So Marples decided he had to go and hatched a plot to remove £2 million from Britain through his Liechtenstein company ... there was nothing for it but to cut and run, which Marples did just before the tax year of 1975. He left by the night ferry with his belongings crammed into tea chests, leaving the floors of his home in Belgravia littered with discarded clothes and possessions ... He claimed he had been asked to pay nearly 30 years' overdue tax ... The Treasury froze his assets in Britain for the next ten years. By then most of them were safely in Monaco and Liechtenstein.\n\nThe flight came at a time when Marples was facing problems on several fronts. Tenants of his block of flats in Harwood Court, Upper Richmond Road, Putney, London, were demanding that he repair serious structural faults and had threatened legal action. He was being sued for £145,000 by the Bankers Trust merchant bank in relation to an agreement made with the French company Ernest Marples et Cie. He was also being sued by John Holmes, the chartered surveyor and director of Marples' property company Ecclestone Enterprises, for wrongful dismissal and who was claiming £70,000 in damages. The Inland Revenue was demanding that he pay nearly 30 years' back taxes on his residence in Eccleston Street, Belgravia, London, as well as capital gains tax on his properties in Kensington. In addition, in 1974, he had lost 130 cases of wine to a fire in a store he owned under a railway line in Brixton, and he had been convicted of drinking and driving for which he received a one-year ban and a £45 fine.\n\nHis departure came in the wake of the failure of a plan to avoid paying tax on his properties by involving a Liechtenstein-based company with which he had been involved for more than ten years. He was to sell his Harwood Court block of flats for £500,000 to Vin International which would refurbish and sell them for between £2.25 million and £2.5 million. Marples would only be liable for capital gains tax at 30% on the transfer to Vin which, as an offshore company, would only be liable for stamp duty at 2%. The plan failed following the change of government in 1974. After reports of this plan were published in the \"Daily Mirror\", the Treasury froze Marples' assets in Britain. In November 1977, he paid £7,600 to the British government in settlement of his breach of exchange control regulations, following which he made a return to London.\n\nMarples' final years were spent on his 45-acre vineyard estate in Fleurie, France. He died in a Monte Carlo hospital on 6 July 1978. In his will, he left property valued at £388,166. He is buried in a family plot in Southern Cemetery, Manchester.\n\nIn 2009, his name was used for a website 'ernestmarples.com' that campaigned to have the UK Postcode dataset released as Open Data and drew threats of legal action by the Royal Mail against its founders. The dataset was opened up on 1 April 2010 following support from many people, including MPs, and Code-Point Open can now be downloaded free with data.gov.uk.\n\nThe founders of the site claim not to have been aware of the controversy around him when they chose his name for the website.\n\n"}

{"id": "1933536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933536", "title": "Phoenix Cinema", "text": "Phoenix Cinema\n\nThe Phoenix Cinema is an independent single-screen community cinema in East Finchley, London, England. It was built in 1910 and opened in 1912 as the East Finchley Picturedrome. It is one of the oldest continuously-running cinemas in the UK and shows mainly art-house films.\n\nIt is distinctive on East Finchley's high road by its large neon sign on the side of the building. Its patrons are Benedict Cumberbatch, Maureen Lipman, Mike Leigh, Ken Loach, Michael Palin, Bill Paterson and Mark Kermode. It is run by a charity as a community cinema.\n\nThe Cinematograph Act 1909 introduced laws to make cinemas safer. As a result, more purpose-built cinemas began to appear from 1910 onwards including this one. The Phoenix Cinema was built in 1910 by Premier Electric Theatres, however the company went bankrupt before the cinema could be opened. In 1912, the building was purchased by businessmen who had been involved in setting up East Sheen Picturedrome. They finally opened it as 'The East Finchley Picturedrome' in May 1912 with 428 seats. The first screening was of a film about the \"Titanic\" which had recently sunk. The natural fall of the land was used for the sloped seating with the screen at the High Road end.\n\nIn 1924, the cinema's name changed to the \"Coliseum\". In 1925, the cinema was sold to Home Counties Theatres Ltd, which also owned the Athenaeum Picture Playhouse and the Summerland Cinema, both in Muswell Hill. At this time, the typical programme was silent movies accompanied by live music, plus variety acts such as singers, magicians and comedians. But in 1928, British cinema went through a huge transformation when the first sound film, \"The Jazz Singer\", featuring the voice of the film's star Al Jolson, premiered in the Piccadilly Theatre, London . Cinemas across London started the transition to sound and on 22 July 1929 this cinema was the first in the area to show a sound film, screening Al Jolson's \"The Singing Fool\".\n\nIn 1937, the building was redesigned and rebuilt in an art deco style and reopened as the \"Rex\" in September 1938. The alterations of 1938 were a response to competition from 1000 seater \"picture palaces\" being built by chains such as Odeon, ABC and Gaumont in the surrounding area.\n\nCinema interior designers Mollo & Egan redesigned the auditorium. The original 1910 barrel vaulted ceiling was retained, but decorative Art Deco panels were added along the walls. The auditorium was reversed, with the screen moving to the opposite end. This involved considerable alteration to the flooring to create a rake for the seating. The colour scheme, like today, was red, bronze and gold. The number of seats increased to 528. A projection box was built over the foyer to satisfy the requirements of the Cinematograph Act 1909, with shutters over the windows to the auditorium which could be closed in case of fire. Kershaw Kalee II arc film projectors with RCA sound heads and an RCA high-fidelity 6-valve amplifier were installed. Behind the screen were two RCA loudspeakers, where they remained for over 60 years. Modern heating and ventilation systems were also installed. These alterations together with the improved sight lines from the seating raised the standard of the Rex to meet those of its north London competitors.\n\nThe front of the cinema was transformed by architects Howes & Jackman with a move to the sleek lines of 1930s art deco architecture. The turrets and decorative plasterwork were removed to give the exterior a more 'modern' look. Glazed black tiles set against cream plaster and a new canopy stretching across the width of the cinema were accompanied by a neon sign with the new name, The Rex.\n\nThe Rex opened as an independent cinema compiling its own programmes, unlike the nearby chain cinemas, whose schedules were decided by their allied production companies.\n\nAdvertising from 1938 reassured the public that \"If it is good it's on our screen\". There was a full programme with a double-bill of two features, a major and minor release, a short and a newsreel, all at the same prices as the chains. Advertising, neglected by the Coliseum, was embraced by The Rex and it was always keeping up with innovations from the larger distributors.\n\nThe Rex's programming policy in the late 1930s allowed it to tailor its presentations to its public's tastes. British films were therefore favoured and popular films were presented that had previously gone round the big circuits, allowing patrons to see films they had missed elsewhere or to see a favourite film a second time around. Sunday showings of older films and a standard mid-week change of programme (when the circuits were holding a film for a whole week) provided a rich diet for even the most enthusiastic cinemagoer.\n\nIn 1973 the Rex was acquired by the Granada Group. The programming policy changed to commercial circuit releases and the previously steady increase in admissions stalled. The EFNA (East Finchley Neighbourhood Association) produced a petition and an accusatory article, Granada Wrecks the Rex, was published by Keith Lumley resulting in a new owner and a programming policy reversal.\n\nThe cinema took its current name in 1975 when it was purchased and run by the distribution company Contemporary Films and concentrated on independent, foreign and specialist films, as it does today.\n\nBy 1983, audience patterns were changing and Contemporary Films considered that the cinema was no longer economically viable. Charles Cooper, owner of Contemporary Films, wanted to sell the cinema and retire. Upon his retirement, the fate of the cinema hung very much in the balance. In 1983, a property company applied to Barnet Council for planning permission to build an office block on the site occupied by the cinema. The Barnet Planning Committee approved the development but the Greater London Council rejected the proposal. After the consequent public inquiry in April 1984 permission for the office block was granted. Following widespread opposition by local residents (with the patronage of Maureen Lipman) the GLC offered a grant to the Trust to purchase the cinema in June 1985. The building and adjoining land were bought by the Trust in December 1985.\n\nIn 1999 an English Heritage review resulted in some thirty cinemas acquiring listed status in recognition of their historic and architectural importance. English Heritage recognised the importance of the Phoenix's original 1910 barrel-vaulted ceiling and the 1938 Mollo and Egan decorative wall panels and in 2000 the cinema received a Grade II listing. As one of the earliest purpose-built cinemas in the UK and one of even fewer still operating as a cinema, the Phoenix is therefore protected from demolition or damaging alterations.\n\nFrancis Coleman, who was prominent in the campaign to save the Phoenix, was the Trust's first Chair. and the current chair is James Kessler QC.\n\nIn addition to a full programme of screenings, the Trust carries on educational and community work including Kids Club (an activity for 5–10-year olds, followed by a film screening); Toddler Time (an activity followed by a 30-minute screening of an animation suitable for 2–4-year olds); Bringing up Baby (enabling parents and carers to enjoy the latest releases with their babies of up to a year old); Film studies programme; Cinememories (free dementia friendly screenings supported by a grant from The Mercer's Company); school screenings, holiday workshops and charity screenings.\n\nAt the beginning of the Trust's ownership, there were barely funds to run the cinema. The heating was antiquated. So was the projection equipment with its carbon arcs. Programming was another challenge. Contemporary Films had won a quota system against mainstream distributors for newly released American and UK films, which meant that the Phoenix was able to \"claim\" every fourth or fifth one.\n\nIn 1989 the Trust enlarged the upper foyer by repositioning the stairs and creating a new entrance to the auditorium.\n\nIn 2010 there was a renovation to celebrate the cinema's centenary designed by HMDW Architects. This introduced a new café-bar with a balcony, reworked the external signage and foyer, and restored the auditorium's barrel-vaulted ceiling, and Art Deco panels.\n\nThe Phoenix has also appeared in many films, TV series and photo shoots, providing the backdrop for anything from educational videos to fashion shoots to TV series and big feature films.\n\nAmong the cinema's biggest dramatic appearances were in TV comedy. In Channel 4's off-beat comedy series \"Black Books\", the show's anti-hero came in when his new alarm system locked him out of his own shop and a hapless Jez tries to impress Zahra on a visit to The Phoenix in series 7, episode 3 of \"Peep Show\". Another notable appearance was in the remake of the classic series \"Randall and Hopkirk\", with Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer.\n\nNeil Jordan chose the Phoenix as an early 20th-century cinema for a scene in his 1994 box-office hit, \"\". Jordan returned to the Phoenix to film scenes in his adaptation of Graham Greene's novel \"The End of the Affair\". The Phoenix has also appeared in the films \"Nine\" (Rob Marshall, 2009), \"Nowhere Boy\" (Sam Taylor-Wood, 2009) and Eddie Redmayne was featured sitting in the auditorium in the film \"My Week with Marilyn\" (Simon Curtis, 2011). It will also appear in a feature film due out in 2017 starring Annette Bening and Jamie Bell based on the novel \"Films Stars Don't Die in Liverpool\".\nThe Phoenix also appears in the video for the Scissor Sisters track \"I Don't Feel Like Dancin'\" and was recently featured in a piece directed by Samantha Morton at the \"Daydreaming with Stanley Kubrick\" exhibition at Somerset House in London.\n\nThe longest film shoot at the cinema so far was for the British comedy \"Mr Love\", made in 1985 starring Barry Jackson. Following the adventures of a projectionist, the Phoenix was a major star of the film for which the Phoenix's chief projectionist served as a technical adviser.\n\n\n\n"}

The nickname \"Tostado\" refers to a ploughman's tanned or sunburnt complexion.\nAfter a course of grammar under the Franciscans he entered the University of Salamanca, where, besides philosophy and theology, he studied civil and canon law, Greek, Hebrew, and the other branches then comprised in the curriculum of a university. By great application joined to an unusually brilliant mind and an extraordinarily retentive memory, he accumulated such a vast store of knowledge that his contemporaries styled him a wonder of the world. At 22 he began to lecture on a wide variety of subjects to large audiences attracted by his learning. \n\nLater he assisted with distinction at the Council of Basle.\nDuring a visit to the papal court at Siena in 1443, he was denounced to Pope Eugene IV as having publicly defended a heretic and some rash propositions, but in an explanatory letter he assured the pontiff of his orthodoxy.\nOn his return to Spain, in 1444, he was appointed Grand Chancellor and councillor of John II of Castile. In 1454, shortly before his premature death (likely in his forties or early fifties), he was named Bishop of Ávila.\nHis sepulcher in Avila was carved by Vasco de la Zarza in 1518.\n\nIn his \"Defensorium\", written against Juan de Torquemada and other critics, he gave utterance to views derogatory to the authority of the pope. \nBesides a Spanish commentary on the chronicles of Eusebius and other minor works, he wrote commentaries on the historical books of the Old Testament as far as Second Chronicles, and on the Gospel according to St. Matthew. These are diffuse, containing many digressions on dogmatic and other subjects. \nTostado's works exercised a significant influence on the Jewish Bible commentator and statesman Isaac Abravanel (1437-1508).\n\nAn edition of his works in 13 folio volumes was published at Venice in 1507 and 1547; a more complete edition in 24 folio volumes appeared at the same place in 1615, and another in 27 folio volumes in 1728.\n\n"}
{"id": "1933547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933547", "title": "Berri, South Australia", "text": "Berri, South Australia\n\nBerri is a town in the Riverland region of South Australia. It is 238 kilometres north-east of Adelaide, the capital of the state of South Australia. It is primarily an agricultural and viticultural town on the north bank of the Murray River. It is the original home of a juice company, Berri Ltd.\n\nThe name \"Berri\" is from the local Aboriginal tribe, Meri, meaning \"a wide bend in the river\". The area was first explored by European settlers when Charles Sturt navigated the Murray River. Its first impetus for settlement came when paddle steamers came down the River Murray and a refuelling stop was developed. This was to become Berri. The area was also part of Cobdogla Station pastoral run before it was broken up for closer farming.\n\nIn 1910, irrigation was established and Berri was proclaimed as a town in 1911. Irrigation subsequently led to the establishment of vineyards and fruit orchards (such as citrus, apricots and peaches). A distillery was established in 1918 and rail arrived in 1928. In 1943, \"Berri Juices\" (Berri Ltd) were first produced. By the 1950s, Berri and other Riverland towns dominated the local economy with fruit and their products.\n\nTransport from one side of the Murray to the other consisted of two parallel ferries. These were replaced by a bridge in 1997 which was opened by the Premier of South Australia, John Olsen. It is the largest of its type in South Australia. It was estimated that 10,000 people attended the official opening on 27 July 1997. The bridge cost $17 million after 30 years of lobbying. The bridge spans the Murray River between Berri and Loxton.\n\nBerri exists in a semi-arid location, north of Goyder's Line. Berri is surrounded by mallee scrub. It is 31 metres above sea level. Berri has a dry mediterranean climate with seasonal temperatures a few degrees above Adelaide's temperatures. The average winter daily maximum temperature is 15.5 °C in July and the average summer daily maximum temperature is 31.1 °C in January. Average rainfall of Berri is 262.0 millimetres. The weather patterns are similar to those of Adelaide.\n\nBerri is a multicultural town with a café and a hotel on the riverside, a main street that overlooks the river and other shopping facilities elsewhere in the town, such as the Riverland Plaza.\n\nThe Berri Visitors Centre shares a spot on the waterfront at the bottom of Vaughan Terrace with the Alba cafe. This is a popular gathering point for Berri professionals and tourists alike, not undue to its waterfront location, alfresco dining and proximity to the visitors centre itself.\n\nThe river itself offers fishing, waterskiing and boating. A boat launching marina is located opposite the Berri caravan park on the waterfront. The Martin's Bend wetland offers educational walk and water sports. Nearby is the \"Katarapko\" section of the Murray River National Park which is a popular area for camping, birdwatching, canoeing and bushwalking.\n\nA past local tourist attraction was the Big Orange, it offered a three-storey high observation deck over the plains and river. The facility also offered souvenirs, refreshments and local produce. It opened in 1980 and closed to visitors in 2004. Development ideas for the future of the site included an orchid nursery, waterfall, butterfly house, tropical garden and bird cages.\n\nHorticulture, in particular oranges and grapes is still strong in the area. Berri is situated in an area of 3000 hectares of irrigated fruit orchards. Secondary industries include fruit packing, fruit juice, and wine.\n\nOther events held in Berri are the annual Riverland Wine and Food Festival and Tour of Riverland Cycling.\n\nThe Country Arts SA River Lands Gallery in Berri has a new exhibition each month, with touring visual arts shows and Riverland based artists.\n\nBerri also has public art work, like the Riverland Vietnam & Post WWII veteran's war memorial, the Aboriginal dreamtime mural underneath the Berri Bridge, and Jimmy James Memorial on the Berri riverfront.\n\nJimmy James was a famous blacktracker, who was born around 1910 and belonged to the Pitjantjatjara people. He moved to the Riverland in the 1940s and took his name from his equally famous father-in-law. He was used extensively by the Police in South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Northern Territory, to track felons, escapees and missing people. A monument is sculptured out of two slabs of finely polished black granite and engraved with images of birds and animals – a part of Jimmy's spirit world.\n\nBerri was home to a community newspaper, the \"Berri Community News\" (3 October 1951 – 19 April 1962), which was later released as \"Berri News\" (9 May 1962 – 30 January 1963), subtitled \"with which is incorporated \"the Berri community news\"\". The publication, issued by Berri War Memorial Community Centre Incorporated, concentrated on news and events from Berri, Glossop, Monash, and Winkie.\n\nBerri is also home to radio stations Magic 93.1 and 5RM.\n\nBerri is in the Berri Barmera Council local government area.

{"id": "1933568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933568", "title": "Derek Riordan", "text": "Derek Riordan\n\nDerek George Riordan (born 16 January 1983) is a Scottish professional footballer who plays as a striker. He has been capped three times by the Scotland national team.\n\nRiordan started his career with Hibernian in 2001 and had a brief spell on loan with Cowdenbeath in 2003. He became one of the top young players in the Scottish Premier League, winning the young player of the year awards in 2005. Riordan signed for Celtic in 2006, but failed to hold down a regular first-team place and returned to Hibernian in 2008. He totalled 104 goals in 260 appearances across all competitions in his two spells at Easter Road.\n\nRiordan left Hibs as a free agent in 2011 and signed for Chinese Super League club Shaanxi Chanba, but the two-year contract was mutually terminated after just four months. He then signed for St Johnstone on a short term contract in March 2012. Riordan then signed for Bristol Rovers, but he was released after a three-month deal. He has since had short spells with Alloa Athletic, Brechin City, East Fife, York City, Edinburgh City and amateurs St Bernard's.\n\nBorn in Edinburgh and raised in the city's Pilton area, Riordan signed for Hibernian on 14 May 1999 and made his first-team debut in 2001 in an Edinburgh derby. In January 2003, Riordan went on loan to Cowdenbeath, along with teammate Paul Hilland. He scored four goals in three appearances for the Fife club, including a hat-trick in a 7–5 win away to Brechin City. Cowdenbeath wanted to extend the loan to the end of the 2002–03 season, but he returned to Hibernian at the end of January.\n\nRiordan was given an extended opportunity in the Hibs first team towards the end of the 2002–03 season. He became a first team regular the following season. Riordan was the club's top goalscorer for each of the next three seasons, with 18, 23 and 20 goals respectively. This earned him recognition in the form of the PFA Scotland Young Player of the Year and SFWA Young Player of the Year awards in 2005, and selections for the Scotland national team later that year.\n\nAt the end of the 2004–05 season, Riordan rejected an offer of an extension to his contract, and Hibs made him available for transfer. A £500,000 fee was agreed with Cardiff City in August 2005, but Riordan rejected the move. During the January 2006 transfer window, Rangers made a £400,000 bid for Riordan that was rejected by Hibs. Bids from Lokomotiv Moscow and Kaiserslautern were accepted by Hibs, but Riordan rejected these moves because he did not want to move overseas.\n\nRiordan caused controversy in 2005 when he appeared in a video that showed him singing that Hearts player Rudi Skácel was a \"fuckin' refugee\", to the tune of The Beatles's \"Yellow Submarine\". Riordan later apologised for his actions.\n\nRiordan signed for Celtic in a £170,000 deal in June 2006. The fee was reduced from the previous offers because Riordan's contract with Hibs was due to expire in October 2006, and Riordan had already made a pre-contract agreement to sign for Celtic on a free transfer in January 2007. Riordan made his full debut for Celtic in a Scottish League Cup tie against St Mirren, as Gordon Strachan fielded a team containing many players who were not first team regulars. He had difficulty obtaining a regular place in the Celtic team; he made only 24 league appearances in two seasons with the club.\n\nRiordan publicly aired his disappointment at not being given more opportunities in the Celtic first team in April 2008, and he subsequently trained with the reserve team. Burnley made a £400,000 offer for Riordan in January 2008, but this was rejected by Celtic. Five other clubs, including his former club Hibernian, made loan offers for Riordan, but Celtic rejected these and informed Riordan that he would have to leave on a \"permanent\" deal. Hibernian made another loan offer to Celtic for Riordan in August 2008, but this was also rejected by Celtic.\n\nRiordan returned to Hibernian on the final day of the 2008 summer transfer window for an \"undisclosed\" fee believed to be around £400,000. Hibs initially gave Riordan the unusual squad number 01, as number 10 had already been allocated to Colin Nish. Riordan was given the number 10 shirt for the 2009–10 season; he was able to do this as Nish had taken number 9 after Steven Fletcher left the club to join Burnley in the summer of 2009. Riordan made his second debut for Hibernian on 13 September 2008, when he came on as a 61st-minute substitute for Joe Keenan against Dundee United. In his second appearance, he scored the only goal of the match against Hamilton Academical. Riordan ended the 2008–09 season as Hibs' top goalscorer with 12 goals.\n\nA good run of form at the start of the following season led to a recall to the Scotland squad and a player of the month award from the SPL. Riordan scored his 100th goal in senior football later that season; he brought up the milestone with a trademark free kick against Kilmarnock that gave Hibs a 1–0 win. Riordan had been omitted from Craig Levein's first Scotland squad, but Hibs manager John Hughes commented that Riordan had \"worked very hard\" in trying to win an international recall. His consistent goalscoring in the 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons came about despite often playing in a wide midfield role.\n\nHughes again praised Riordan during the 2010 pre-season. Soon afterwards, Riordan declared that he wanted to agree a new contract with the club. He was however also linked with a £500,000 move to Azerbaijan Premier League club Gabala, who at the time where managed by Tony Adams. After the sale of Anthony Stokes to Celtic, Hughes started using Riordan as a central striker. Despite scoring three goals in the early part of the season, Riordan was omitted from the Scotland squad in October 2010.\n\nAfter Hughes was replaced by Colin Calderwood as Hibs manager in October 2010, the new manager gave Riordan the team captaincy. In his second match as captain, the first Edinburgh derby of the season, Riordan was sent off for a reckless lunge on Rudi Skácel in the dying minutes of a 2–0 loss. Riordan bounced back by scoring both goals in a 2–1 win against Motherwell the following weekend. He registered his 100th goal for Hibs in all competitions during a 2–1 defeat at Kilmarnock in December. Riordan was the first player to achieve this milestone since Arthur Duncan thirty years ago. A goal against Hamilton in March 2011 meant that Riordan became the third highest goalscorer in the Scottish Premier League era, behind only the prolific Old Firm goalscorers Kris Boyd and Henrik Larsson.\n\nIn April 2011, the \"Daily Express\" reported that Riordan would leave Hibernian when his contract expired at the end of the 2010–11 season. The newspaper claimed that Riordan had turned down an offer of a new deal on reduced terms.\n\nRiordan signed a two-year contract with Chinese Super League club Shaanxi Chanba in July 2011. On 10 July 2011, Riodran made his debut for Shaanxi Chanba as a substitute coming on for Fabio Firmani in the 76th minute as they lost 1–0 to Liaoning Whowin, and made his start in a 1–1 draw against Shenzhen Ruby on 14 July. His first goal came when he scored against Chengdu Blades in a 3–1 win on 21 August. He became a favourite player of the fans, but the team performed poorly in the 2011 season. The team manager, Gao Hongbo, criticised Riordan after a defeat by Dalian Shide. Riordan decided to leave the club and his contract was terminated by mutual consent in November 2011.\n\nSky Sports reported that clubs in Italy and Turkey were interested in signing Riordan in January. Riordan trained with Kilmarnock and Blackpool in January, and St Johnstone in March. On 30 March, Riordan signed for St Johnstone until the end of the 2011–12 season. On 21 April 2012, Riordan made his first start in a 2–0 defeat against Dundee United and played 90 minutes in a 5–1 loss against Motherwell on 28 April 2012. \"The Courier\" newspaper reported on 15 May that his contract with St Johnstone would not be extended.\n\nRiordan agreed in July 2012 to go on trial with an unnamed club in La Liga. Later in July, Riordan trained with League One club Milton Keynes Dons. In August, Ross County made contact with his agent.\n\nOn 27 September 2012, Riordan signed for League Two club Bristol Rovers on a three-month deal. He made his debut on 29 September, in a 2–1 victory against local rivals Exeter City. He made his home debut on 3 October in a 1–0 defeat to Cheltenham Town. Riordan was released at the end of his contract, having made 12 appearances without scoring a goal.\n\nRiordan trained with Scottish Championship club Alloa Athletic in November 2013. On 14 February 2014, Alloa signed Riordan on a deal until the end of the season. He made only two substitute appearances in a spell that was affected by an ankle injury. Riordan was released by Alloa at the end of the 2013–14 season.\n\nRiordan played as a trialist for Brechin City in October 2014. He was involved in three matches for Brechin, the maximum permitted for a trialist, after which Riordan turned down a contract offer.\n\nHe then played as a trialist for East Fife in February 2015, scoring the winning goal in a match against Annan Athletic. East Fife manager Gary Naysmith then offered Riordan a contract to the end of the season, which was signed in early March. Riordan left East Fife at the end of the 2014–15 season. He trained with Hibernian in September 2015, with manager Alan Stubbs commenting that Riordan had been provided with their facilities due to his previous service for the club.\n\nOn 29 January 2016, Riordan signed for League Two club York City on a contract until the end of the 2015–16 season. He was released by York when his contract expired.\n\nRiordan signed a short-term contract with Scottish League Two club Edinburgh City on 27 February 2017. He scored on his debut on 11 March 2017, with a 75th-minute goal in a 2–1 away win over Forfar Athletic. Riordan left the club at the end the 2016–17 season following the end of his contract, having scored three goals in seven appearances.\n\nHe signed for Edinburgh amateur club St Bernard's in April 2018.\n\nRiordan was capped five times by the Scotland national under-19 team (2001), five times by the under-21 team (2004 to 2005) and three times by the senior team (2005 to 2009).\n\nCeltic\n\nIndividual\n\n"}

{"id": "1933577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933577", "title": "Wide boy", "text": "Wide boy\n\nWide boy is a British term for a man who lives by his wits, wheeling and dealing. According to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" it is synonymous with spiv. The word \"wide\" used in this sense means wide-awake or sharp-witted. The term was used in a 1936 autobiography to describe criminal culture during the First World War. Newspapers of the late 1940s and 1950s often use both terms in the same article about the same person when dealing with ticket touts, fraudsters and black market traders. It has become more generally used to describe a dishonest trader or a petty criminal who works by guile rather than force.\n\nAn early use of the term was in the 1933 film \"Friday the Thirteenth\", where the character played by Max Miller, a loud, quick-witted, Cockney market trader, is heard to say \"I'm the widest boy ever put on a pair of shoes!\"\n\nThe term came to public attention in 1937 with the publication of \"Wide Boys Never Work\" by Robert Westerby, a novel about gamblers and hustlers. During World War II such individuals became involved in the black market, but the term only began to appear in newspapers from 1947.\n\nFictional wheeler-dealer characters such as\nDel Boy from \"Only Fools and Horses\",\nFrank Butcher from \"EastEnders\",\nPrivate Walker from \"Dad's Army\",\nArthur Daley from \"Minder\",\nMike from \"The Young Ones\",\nHarry Robinson from \"The Ladykillers\",\nand Flash Harry from the \"St Trinian's\" films, all exemplify various wide boy \"types\".\n\nThe Kinks referred to the term in the lyrics to their song \"Scum of the Earth\" on their 1974 album \"\". This is an early usage of the term in a modern rock song. Kinks songwriter Ray Davies later used the term again in his song \"Stand Up Comic\".\n\nIn Richard Thompson's song \"I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight\", on the album of the same name by Richard and Linda Thompson (1974), the lyrics include the line \"The wide boys are all spoiling for a fight\". When he performs the song live, Thompson often changes it to \"big boys\".\n\nUltravox released the song \"Wide Boys\" on their eponymous first LP in 1977. The 1970s rock band Foghat had a popular song \"Wide Boy\" on their 1981 \"Girls to Chat Boys to Bounce\" album, and Godley and Creme released a single of the same title in 1980 which was to start their careers in video direction. Kevin Mooney, formerly of Adam and the Ants, formed the short-lived band Wide Boy Awake in 1982 who disbanded after a couple of EPs. Nik Kershaw also released a single called \"Wide Boy\" in 1984, making Top Ten in the UK. Rick Lloyd's song of the same name was sung by Perry Cree for Sue Townsend's musical \"The Ghost of Daniel Lambert\"; this song was later covered by The Flying Pickets on their album \"Lost Boys\" in 1984, and also appeared in the 1977 television play Scum. Marillion (with Fish) released \"Heart of Lothian\" on the 1985 album \"Misplaced Childhood\", in which the lyrics mention \"wide boys, born with hearts of Lothian\".\n\n\"Wide boys\" is used humorously but now commonly to refer to wingers in Association, Gaelic or Rugby Football.\n\n\n"}

It is a Municipal council.\n\nPrakasha village, which is around 15 km south-west of Shahada, is the second most important excavation site in Maharashtra. In 1955 B K Thapar on behalf of Archaeological Survey of India excavated site near confluence of Tapi River and Gomai River. Excavation exposed 17 meter deep occupational deposit – hammer stones, restricted use of copper, low grade bronze dating back to 1700 BC. Around 6 km north of Shahada there are several centuries old sculptures complex in Gomai River. The main sculpture is popularly known as Mahavir sculpture and the entire sculptures complex is popularly known as Pandavleni or 'Panch Pandav'. This evidence suggest that Shahada and area on the banks of Gomai River has been inhabited at least since 1700 BC. Shahada- municipality was established in the British period, in the year 1869.\nShahada and bhada are the two locations of this area situated on the river bank Gomai.These names observed in local gurjar language meaning saadha bhada means simple.\n\n India census, Shahada had a population of 61,376, being 52% male and 48% female.

As the Satpura Mountain Range just 30 km north of Shahada, the bedrock is on an average 5 metres below the ground level. Due to natural or human-made caves, the ground at Savalde village, 5 km away from Shahada, caved in during heavy rain during August 2006 and caused an earthquake of magnitude 2.8 on Richter Scale on 10 November 2006. As seismograph stations are installed away from traffic to avoid false-positive results from ground vibrations, Shahada's seismograph station of the Sardar Sarovar Project is installed in the same village.\n\nThe soil above the bedrock is good for farming except in some areas. Average rainfall is 552 mm = 21.7 inches. The climate is hot for most of the year. Maximum temperature reaches up to 48 °C in summer and minimum temperature fall up to 9 °C in the winter. The climate of Shahada is on the whole dry except during the south-west monsoon season and winter months December to February. The year may be divided into four seasons.

It was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in June 2002 for a unique combination of geological, historical, cultural and industrial reasons.\n\nThe region's rocks were laid down in the Devonian period and are known as Rhenish Facies. This is a fossil-bearing sedimentary rock type consisting mainly of slate. The rocks underwent considerable folding during the Carboniferous period. The gorge was carved out during a much more recent uplift to leave the river contained within steep walls 200 m high, the most famous feature being the Loreley.\n\nThe gorge produces its own microclimate and has acted as a corridor for species not otherwise found in the region. Its slopes have long been terraced for agriculture, in particular viticulture which has good conditions on south-facing slopes. Most of the vineyards belong to the wine region Mittelrhein, but the southernmost parts of the Rhine Gorge fall in Rheingau and Nahe.\n\nThe river has been an important trade route into central Europe since prehistoric times and a string of small settlements has grown up along the banks. Constrained in size, many of these old towns retain a historic feel today. With increasing wealth, many castles appeared and the valley became a core region of the Holy Roman Empire. It was at the centre of the Thirty Years' War, which left many of the castles in ruins, a particular attraction for today's cruise ships which follow the river. At one time forming a border of France, in the 19th Century the valley became part of Prussia and its landscape became the quintessential image of Germany.\n\nThis part of the Rhine features strongly in folklore, such as a legendary castle on the Rhine being the setting for the opera Götterdämmerung. The annual Rhine in Flames festivals include spectacular firework displays at Sankt Goar in September and Koblenz in August, the best view being from one of a convoy of boats.\n\n\n\n"}

All 29 people on board Trans Australia Airlines Flight 538 were killed.\n\nThe aircraft was TAA's first Fokker Friendship F-27 aircraft; TAA was the first airline outside of Europe to order the type. TAA's director of engineering, John L. Watkins OBE, accepted the aircraft, registered VH-TFB, at the Fokker works near Schiphol Airport, Amsterdam, on 6 April 1959. The aircraft was christened \"Abel Tasman\" after the Dutch explorer who was the first European to reach New Zealand, Tasmania, and parts of mainland Australia in 1642–1644; the acceptance ceremony was attended by the Australian ambassador and his wife, Sir Edwin and Lady McCarthy. The aircraft delivery flight to Australia was captained by Don Winch.\n\nBy June 1960, TAA had 12 Fokker Friendships in service. In the 14 years since the airline's creation in 1946, it had experienced only two fatal accidents – a Douglas DC-3 carrying cargo crashed after take-off from Cambridge Aerodrome on 8 August 1951, killing both pilots; and a Vickers Viscount crashed on a training flight on 31 October 1954, killing three pilots.\n\nOn the late afternoon and evening of Friday, 10 June 1960, VH-TFB was flying TAA Flight 538 from Brisbane to Mackay, with stops at Maryborough and Rockhampton. It left Brisbane on time at 5 pm under the command of Captain F. C. Pollard with G. L. Davis as First Officer.\n\nThe flight to Maryborough and on to Rockhampton was normal. The aircraft arrived at Rockhampton Airport at 7:12 pm, where the crew received the weather forecast for Mackay, predicting shallow fog patches. VH-TFB was refuelled to 700 gallons, giving sufficient range to continue on to Townsville if fog made it impossible to land in Mackay.\n\nAdding to the nine passengers already aboard, seven adults and nine schoolboys joined the flight at Rockhampton. All the schoolboys were boarders at Rockhampton Grammar School, returning home to Mackay for the Queen's Birthday long weekend.\n\nVH-TFB departed from Rockhampton at 7:52 pm and ascended to . At 8:17 pm, Mackay air traffic controller E. W. Miskell reported that fog had rolled in and temporarily closed Mackay Airport. A few minutes later, having come to the spot where he would start descending, Captain Pollard told the tower controller he would hold over Mackay at in case visibility improved. At 8:40 pm they reported they were over the airport. It was a bright moonlit night with a completely calm sea and two approaches were aborted due to a low layer of cloud on the coastline obscuring the sight of the strip on final approach.\n\nBy 10 pm, the fog was thinning. Air traffic controller Miskell reported this to VH-TFB, and Captain Pollard said they would begin an approach to the airport. Miskell reported the airport conditions. Pollard acknowledged the transmission.\n\nMiskell then telephoned the airport fire service for the latest ground temperature. It was 55.4 degrees Fahrenheit (13 degrees Celsius.) Miskell immediately reported this to VH-TFB. This time, there was no acknowledgement. Miskell transmitted again, noting the time was 10:05pm, and again there was no reply. At 10:10 pm, Miskell started the procedure for launching a search and rescue operation.\n\nFive hours after the accident, at about 3 am on the morning of Saturday, 11 June 1960, a searchlight-equipped motor launch found items of wreckage, including damaged passenger seats, clothing and cabin furnishings, floating on the ocean between Round Top Island and Flat Top Island, five nautical miles due east of Mackay Airport.\n\nA navy survey ship, HMAS \"Warrego\", was sent to search for the sunken wreckage, and arrived on Sunday, 12 June 1960. At 4:20 pm that afternoon, \"Warrego\" discovered the major sections of VH-TFB in of water, a further south-west of Round Top Island (or about south-east of Mackay Airport). Salvaging the wreck took another two weeks.\n\nA Board of Accident Inquiry was appointed on 29 July 1960; after allowing the investigators to sift the wreckage, it finally opened on 4 October 1960. The board sat for four days in Brisbane and two more in Mackay, before concluding on 10 November 1960. The Board was chaired by Mr Justice Spicer of the Commonwealth Industrial Court.\n\nThe inquiry did not determine a particular cause. The aircraft had flown into the ocean for no apparent reason, and so the board focussed on the altimeter. One possibility was that the static pressure system or altimeter was malfunctioning and not allowing display of the correct altitude.\n\nAnother possibility was that the reading of the three-pointer altimeter was misinterpreted. This type of altimeter has individual pointers for thousands, hundreds and tens of feet, and can be difficult to interpret. Errors of 1,000 or 10,000 feet were common, as had been outlined by W. F. Grether in a 1949 report for the \"Journal of Applied Psychology\". As a consequence, three-pointer altimeters were later removed from service. If human error were the case, the accident may have simply been the result of a controlled flight into terrain. However, many commentators thought this unlikely, given the long experience of Captain Pollard.\n\nAnother possibility was posited by TAA's director of engineering, John L. Watkins OBE, who was intrigued by a mysterious brown glass medicine bottle discovered in the wreckage of the cockpit. Watkins theorised that one of the schoolchildren on the flight may have been an aviation enthusiast, and had been shown into the cockpit whilst handling a bottle of model aircraft fuel. At some point the bottle's contents may have spilled in the cockpit, the fumes distracting the pilots enough for them to make a mistake and crash.\n\nFrank McMullen, TAA's Technical Services Engineering Superintendent and F27 Project Engineer, was a member of the team that joined with Department of Civil Aviation officials studying the crash. He formed the view that at the third attempt to land, the crew adopted a low flight path hoping to keep the airstrip in sight below the cloud layer, but were deceived by the difficulty in assessing height over a glassy sea and put the left wing tip into the water turning onto the runway approach.\n\nOne of the recommendations made by the Board of Accident Inquiry was that passenger-carrying aircraft of the size of the F-27 and larger should be equipped with flight data recorders.\n\nAustralia became the first country to mandate the carriage of cockpit voice recorders on civil transport aircraft, a trend which was later followed by other countries. Today, all large civil transport aircraft are required to carry a CVR.\n\nTrans Australia Airlines Flight 538 and the 1950 Australian National Airways Douglas DC-4 crash, with 29 fatalities each, remain Australia's worst civil air accidents and second-worst air accidents. The greatest loss of life in an air accident in Australia was the Bakers Creek air crash in 1943 which caused 40 fatalities in a United States Army Air Forces Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress.\n\n\n"}

The island is an active shield volcano that has most recently been erupting since April 11, 2009.\n\nWhile anchored in Banks Bay, Captain Benjamin Morrell recorded one of the largest eruptions in Galápagos' history at Fernandina Volcano.

The distillery was the most northerly on the Scottish mainland (it has been usurped by Wolfburn Distillery near Thurso) and was quite inaccessible, except by sea, when established.

{"id": "1933628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933628", "title": "Neferefre", "text": "Neferefre\n\nNeferefre Isi (; also known as Raneferef, Ranefer and in Greek as , ) was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty during the Old Kingdom period. He was most likely the eldest son of pharaoh Neferirkare Kakai and queen Khentkaus II. He was known as prince Ranefer before he ascended to the throne.\n\nNeferefre started a pyramid for himself in the royal necropolis of Abusir called \"Netjeribau Raneferef\", which means \"The bas of Neferefre are divine\". The pyramid was never finished, with a mason's inscription showing that works on the stone structure were abandoned during or shortly after the king's second year of reign. Together with the sparsity of attestations contemporaneous with his reign, this is taken by Egyptologists as evidence that Neferefre died unexpectedly after two to three years on the throne. Neferefre was nonetheless buried in his pyramid, hastily completed in the form of a mastaba by his second successor and presumably younger brother, pharaoh Nyuserre Ini. Fragments of his mummy were uncovered there, showing that he died in his early twenties.\n\nLittle is known of Neferefre's activities beyond laying the foundations of his pyramid and attempting to finish that of his father. A single text shows that Neferefre had planned or just started to build a sun temple called \"Hotep-Re\", meaning \"Ra is content\" or \"Ra's offering table\", which possibly never functioned as such given the brevity of the king's reign. After his death, Neferefre might have been succeeded by an ephemeral and little-known pharaoh, Shepseskare, whose relation with Neferefre remains highly uncertain and debated.\n\nThere are very few archaeological sources contemporaneous with Neferefre, a fact which is now seen by Egyptologists, including Miroslav Verner, to imply a very short reign. Verner knew of only one inscription dated to his rule. It was left by the builders of his pyramid on a corner block at the end of the corridor leading to the pyramid substructures. The inscription was written on the fourth day of the Akhet season in the year of first occurrence of the cattle count, an event consisting of counting the livestock throughout the country to evaluate the amount of taxes to be levied. It is traditionally believed that such counts occurred every two years during the Old Kingdom although recent reappraisals have led Egyptologists to posit a less regular and somewhat more frequent count. Therefore, the inscription must refer to Neferefre's first or second year on the throne, and his third year at the very latest. Finally, a few artefacts dated to Neferefre's rule or shortly after have been uncovered in his mortuary complex and elsewhere in Abusir, such as clay seals bearing his Horus name.\n\nSome of the Abusir Papyri discovered in Khentkhaus II's temple and dating to the mid- to late Fifth Dynasty mention the mortuary temple and funerary cult of Neferefre. They constitute a written source near-contemporaneous with his reign, which not only confirmed the existence of Neferefre's pyramid complex at a time when it had not yet been identified, but also gives details regarding the administrative organisation and importance of the funerary cult of the king in Ancient Egyptian society.\n\nNeferefre is present on several Ancient Egyptian king lists, all dating to the New Kingdom period. The earliest such list mentioning Neferefre is the Abydos King List, written during the reign of Seti I (fl. 1290–1279 BC), and where his prenomen occupies the 29th entry, between those of Neferirkare Kakai and Nyuserre Ini. During the subsequent reign of Ramses II (fl. 1279–1213 BC), Neferefre appears on the Saqqara Tablet, this time after Shepseskare, that is as a second successor to Neferirkare Kakai. Owing to a scribal error, Neferefre's name on this list is given as \"Khanefere\" or \"Neferkhare\".\nNeferefre's prenomen was in all probability also given on the Turin canon (third column, 21st row), which dates to the same period as the Saqqara tablet, but it has since been lost in a large lacuna affecting the document. Nonetheless, the part of the reign length attributed to Neferefre by the canon is still legible, with a single stroke sign indicating one year of reign to which a decade could in principle be added, as the corresponding sign would be effectively lost in the lacuna of the document.\n\nNeferefre was also likely mentioned in the \"Aegyptiaca\", a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II (283–246 BC) by the Egyptian priest Manetho. No copies of the \"Aegyptiaca\" have survived to this day and it is now known only through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius. Africanus relates that the \"Aegyptiaca\" mentioned the succession \"Nefercherês → Sisirês → Cherês\" for the mid-Fifth Dynasty. Nefercherês, Sisirês and Cherês are believed to be the hellenized forms for Neferirkare, Shepseskare and Neferkhare (that is Neferefre), respectively. Thus, Manetho's reconstruction of the Fifth Dynasty is in good agreement with the Saqqara tablet. In Africanus' epitome of the \"Aegyptiaca\", Cherês is reported to have reigned for 20 years.\n\nNeferefre was, in all likelihood, the eldest son of his predecessor pharaoh Neferirkare Kakai with queen Khentkaus II.\nThis is shown by a relief on a limestone slab discovered in a house in the village near Abusir and depicting Neferirkare and his wife Khentkaus with \"the king's eldest son Ranefer\", a name identical with some variants of Neferefre's own. This indicates that Ranefer was Neferefre's name when he was still only a crown prince, that is, before his accession to the throne.\n\nNeferirkare and Khentkaus had at least another son, the future king Nyuserre Ini. In addition, since the relation between Shepseskare and Neferefre remains uncertain, it is possible that the two were brothers too, as suggested by the Egyptologist Silke Roth, although other hypotheses on the matter have been proposed: Verner sees Shepseskare as a son of Sahure and hence Neferefre's uncle, while Jaromír Krejčí believes Shepseskare was Neferefre's son.\nFinally, yet another brother, possibly younger than both Neferefre and Nyuserre has also been proposed: Iryenre, a prince \"iry-pat\" whose filiation is suggested by the fact that his funerary cult was associated with that of his mother, both having taken place in the temple of Khentkaus II.\n\nUntil 2014, no consort of Neferefre was known. Late in that year, the mastaba of Khentkaus III was discovered by archaeologists from the Czech Institute of Egyptology working in Abusir, south east of Neferefre's pyramid. The location and date of the tomb as well as inscriptions found in it strongly suggest that Khentkaus III was Neferefre's queen. Indeed, not only was Khentkaus III presumably buried during the few decades following Neferefre's reign, but her mastaba is also in close proximity to his pyramid, and she bore the title of \"king's wife\", proving that she was a queen.\n\nIn addition, Khentkaus III was also called \"king's mother\" by inscriptions in her tomb, indicating that her son had become pharaoh. Since Neferefre's second successor Nyuserre Ini is known to have been his brother rather than his son, and since Khentkaus III might have been buried during Nyuserre's reign, as indicated by mud seals, this only leaves either Neferefre's ephemeral successor Shepseskare or Nyuserre's successor Menkauhor Kaiu as possibilities. There is an ongoing debate in Egyptology concerning these two alternatives. Verner posits that Shepseskare was an uncle of Neferefre and therefore that Menkauhor Kaiu was Neferefre's son. Meanwhile, Krejčí views the opposite hypothesis, that Shepseskare was Neferefre's son with Khentkaus III, as more probable.\n\nTwo further sons of Neferefre and Khentkaus III have been proposed by Verner: the \"king's son\" Nakhtsare, whose filiation is supported by the general date and location of his tomb, and Kakaibaef, a member of the elite buried in Abusir. Krejčí notes the lack of the titular \"king's son\" in relation to Kakaibaef, thereby emphasizing the conjectural nature of Verner's assertion.\n\nTwo competing hypotheses exist in Egyptology to describe the succession of events running from the death of Neferirkare Kakai, third king of the Fifth Dynasty, to the coronation of Nyuserre Ini, sixth ruler of the dynasty. Relying on historical sources, most notably the Saqqara king list and Manetho's \"Aegyptiaca\", where Neferefre is said to have succeeded Shepseskare, many Egyptologists such as Jürgen von Beckerath and Hartwig Altenmüller have traditionally believed that the following royal succession took place: Neferirkare Kakai → Shepseskare → Neferefre Isi → Nyuserre Ini. In this scenario, Neferefre would be the father of Nyuserre, who would have become pharaoh after the former's unexpected death.\n\nThis view was challenged at the turn of the millennium, most notably by Verner, who has been responsible for the archaeological excavations of the Fifth Dynasty royal necropolis of Abusir since 1976. Firstly, there is the relief, mentioned earlier, showing that Neferefre was in all likelihood Neferirkare's eldest son.\n\nSecondly, excavations of Neferefre's pyramid have yielded his mummy, which showed that he was 18 to 20 years of age at the death of Neferirkare. Consequently, as the previous king's eldest son, in his late teens to early twenties, Neferefre was in optimal position to ascend the throne. Positing that Shepseskare reigned between Neferefre and his father would thus require an explanation as to why and how Shepseskare's claim to the throne could have been stronger than Neferefre's.\nThirdly, archaeological evidences indicate that Shepseskare most likely reigned for only a few weeks to a few months at the most rather than seven years as credited to him in the \"Aegyptiaca\", a hypothesis already supported by Nicolas Grimal as early as 1988.\nIndeed, Shepseskare is the least known Fifth Dynasty king, with only two seals and a few seal impressions bearing his name known as of 2017, a paucity of attestations suggesting a very short reign. This is also supported by the state of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid, which \"was interrupted [and] corresponds to the work of several weeks, perhaps no more than one or two months\".\n\nFourthly, archaeological evidence also favors dating Shepseskare's reign to after Neferefre's. Some of the few seal impressions bearing Shepseskare's name have been discovered in the oldest part of Neferefre's mortuary temple, which was not built until Neferefre's death. This seems to indicate that Shepseskare made offerings for the funerary cult of Neferefre, who must therefore have reigned before him. Another argument concerns the alignment of pyramids of Sahure, Neferirkare Kakai and Neferefre: they form a line pointing to Heliopolis, just as the three pyramids of Giza do. In contrast, Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid does not fall on the line to Heliopolis, which strongly suggests that Neferefre's pyramid had already been in place when Shepseskare started to build his. Lastly, while Shepseskare is noted as the immediate predecessor of Neferefre in the Saqqara king list, Verner notes that \"this slight discrepancy can be attributed to the [political] disorders of the time and its dynastic disputes.\" Verner's arguments have convinced a number of Egyptologists, including Darrell Baker, Erik Hornung and Iorwerth Edwards.\n\nWhile Neferefre is given a reign of some 20 years in epitomes of Manetho's \"Aegyptiaca\", the current academic view is that this number is an overestimation of his true reign length, which must have been significantly shorter. Before the results of the extensive excavations in Abusir were fully published, Egyptologists following the traditional succession hypothesis credited Neferefre with around a decade of rule, based on the paucity of attestations contemporaneous with his reign. For example, von Beckerath and Winfried Barta gave him 11 and 10 years on the throne, respectively. This view now has few supporters.\n\nIndeed, since then, Verner has set forth the hypothesis of a reign of no more than two years. His conclusion is based on archaeological evidence: the unfinished state of his intended pyramid, and the general paucity of documents datable to his rule. Verner writes that:\nThe shape of the tomb of Neferefra...as well as a number of other archaeological finds clearly indicate that the construction of the king's funerary monument was interrupted, owing to the unexpected early death of the king. The plan of the unfinished building had to be basically changed and a decision was taken to hastily convert the unfinished pyramid, (of which only the incomplete lowest step of the core was built), into a \"square-shaped mastaba\" or, more precisely, a stylized primeval hill. At the moment of the king's death neither the burial apartment was built, nor was the foundation of the mortuary temple laid.\n\nFurthermore, two historical sources conform with the hypothesis of a short reign: the mason's inscription in Neferefre's pyramid was discovered \"at about two thirds of the height of the extant core of the monument\" and probably refers to Neferefre's first or second year on the throne; and the Turin canon which credits Neferefre with less than two full years of reign. The combination of archaeological and historical evidence led to the consensus that Neferefre's reign lasted \"not longer than about two years\".\n\nNeferefre started the construction of a pyramid for himself in the royal necropolis of Abusir, where his father and grandfather had built their own pyramids. It was known to the Ancient Egyptians as \"Netjeribau Raneferef\" meaning \"The bas of Neferefre are divine\".\n\nPlanned with a square base of , the pyramid of Neferefre was to be larger than those of Userkaf and Sahure, but smaller than that of his father Neferirkare. Upon the unexpected death of Neferefre, only its lower courses had been completed, reaching a height of c. . Subsequently, Nyuserre hastily completed the monument by filling its central part with poor quality limestone, mortar and sand. The external walls of the building were given a smooth and nearly vertical covering of gray limestone at an angle of 78° with the ground so as to give it the form of a mastaba, albeit with a square plan rather than with the usual rectangular shape. Finally, the roof terrace was covered with clay into which local desert gravels were pressed, giving it the appearance of a mound in the surrounding desert, and indeed it was by the name \"the Mound\" that the monument was subsequently called by the Ancient Egyptians. Verner has proposed that the monument was completed this way so as to give it the form of the primeval mound, the mound that arose from the primordial waters Nu in the creation myth of the Heliopolitan form of Ancient Egyptian religion.\n\nThe monument was used as a stone quarry from the New Kingdom period onwards, but was later preserved from further damages as its appearance of a rough unfinished and abandoned pyramid did not attract the attention of tomb robbers.\n\nWorks on the mortuary temple in which the funerary cult of the deceased king was to take place had not even started when Neferefe died. In the short 70-day period allowed between a king's death and his burial, Neferefre's successor—possibly the ephemeral Shepseskare—built a small limestone chapel. It was located on the pyramid base platform, in the gap left between the masonry and the platform edge, where the pyramid casing would have been put in the original plans. This small chapel was completed during Nyuserre's reign. This pharaoh also built a larger mortuary temple for his brother Neferefre, extending over the whole length of the pyramid side but built of cheaper mudbrick.\nThe temple entrance comprised a courtyard adorned with two stone and 24 wooden columns. Behind was the earliest hypostyle hall of Ancient Egypt the remains of which can still be detected, its roof supported by wooden columns in the shape of lotus-clusters resting on limestone bases. This hall was possibly inspired by the royal palaces of the time. The structure housed a large wooden statue of the king as well as statues of prisoners of war. Storage rooms for the offerings were located to the north of the hall. In these rooms several statues of Neferefre were discovered, including six heads of the kings, making Neferefre the Fifth Dynasty king with the most surviving statues. East of the main hall was the \"Sanctuary of the Knife\" which served as a slaughterhouse for the rituals. Two narrow rooms on either sides of the central altar in front of the false door in the main hall may have housed long solar boats similar to Khufu's.\n\nA significant cache of administrative papyri, comparable in size to the Abusir Papyri found in the temples of Neferirkare and Khentkaus II, was discovered in a storeroom of the mortuary temple of Neferere during a 1982 University of Prague Egyptological Institute excavation. The presence of this cache is due to the peculiar historical circumstances of the mid-Fifth Dynasty. As both Neferirkare and Neferefre died before their pyramid complexes could be finished, Nyuserre altered their planned layout, diverting the causeway leading to Neferirkare's pyramid to his own. This meant that Neferefre's and Neferirkare's mortuary complexes became somewhat isolated on the Abusir plateau. Their priests therefore had to live next to the temple premises in makeshift dwellings, and they stored the administrative records onsite. In contrast, the records of other temples were kept in the pyramid town close to Sahure's or Nyuserre's pyramid, where the current level of ground water means any papyrus has long since disappeared.\n\nFragments of mummy wrappings and cartonnage, as well as scattered pieces of human remains, were discovered on the east side of the burial chamber of the pyramid. The remains amounted to a left hand, a left clavicle still covered with skin, fragments of skin probably from the forehead, upper eyelid and the left foot and a few bones.\nThese remains were in the same archaeological layer as broken pieces from a red granite sarcophagus as well as what remained of the funerary equipment of the king, hinting that they could indeed belong to Neferefre. This was further corroborated by subsequent studies of the embalming techniques used on the mummy, found to be compatible with an Old Kingdom date.\n\nThe body of the king was probably dried by means of natron and then covered with a thin layer of resin, before being given a white calcareous coating. There is no evidence of brain removal as expected from post-Old Kingdom mummification techniques. A final confirmation of the identity of the mummy is provided by radiocarbon dating, which yielded a 2628–2393 BC interval for the human remains in close correspondence with estimated dates for the Fifth Dynasty. Thus, Neferefre is, with Djedkare Isesi, one of the very few Old Kingdom pharaohs whose mummy has been identified.\nA bioarchaeological analysis of Neferefre's remains revealed that the king did not partake in strenuous work, died in his early twenties at between 20 and 23 years old and that he may have stood to in height.\nThe remains of a second individual were discovered in the burial chamber, but those proved to belong to an individual from the Late Middle Ages, who likely lived during the 14th century AD. He had simply been laid on rags and covered with sand for his burial.\n\nFollowing a tradition established by Userkaf, founder of the Fifth Dynasty, Neferefre planned or built a temple to the sun god Ra. Called \"Hotep-Re\" by the Ancient Egyptians, meaning \"Ra is content\" or \"Ra's offering table\", the temple has not yet been located but is presumably in the vicinity of Neferefre's pyramid in Abusir. It is known solely from inscriptions discovered in the mastaba of Ti in North Saqqara, where it is mentioned four times. Ti served as an administration official in the pyramid and sun temples of Sahure, Neferirkare and Nyuserre.\n\nGiven Neferefre's very short reign, the lack of attestations of the \"Hotep-Re\" beyond the mastaba of Ti, as well as the lack of priests having served in the temple, Verner proposes that the temple might never have been completed and therefore never functioned as such. Rather it might have been integrated to or its materials reused for the \"Shesepibre\", the sun temple built by Neferefre's probable younger brother, Nyuserre. Incidentally, an earlier discovery by the German archaeological expedition of 1905 under the direction of Friedrich Wilhelm von Bissing may vindicate Verner's theory. This expedition uncovered the ruins of large buildings of mudbricks beneath the sun temple of Nyuserre in Abu Gorab. It is possible that these represent the remains of the sun temple of Neferefre, although in the absence of inscriptions confirming this identification, it remains conjectural.\n\nWhen he ascended the throne, Neferefre faced the task of completing the pyramid of his father which, with a square base side of and a height of , is the largest built during the Fifth Dynasty. Although well underway at the death of Neferirkare, the pyramid was lacking its external limestone cladding and the accompanying mortuary temple still had to be built. Neferefre thus started to cover the pyramid surface with limestone and build the foundation of a stone temple on the pyramid's eastern side. His plans were cut short by his death and the duty of finishing the monument fell on Nyuserre's shoulders, who abandoned the task of covering the pyramid face and instead concentrated on building the mortuary temple in bricks and wood.\n\nLike other pharaohs of the Old Kingdom period, Neferefre benefited from a funerary cult established at his death. Some details of this cult as it occurred during the Fifth Dynasty have survived in the Abusir Papyri. A 10-day yearly festival was held in honor of the deceased ruler during which, on at least one occasion, no less than 130 bulls were sacrificed in the slaughter house of his mortuary temple. The act of mass animal sacrifice testifies to the importance that royal funerary cults had in Ancient Egyptian society, and also shows that vast agricultural resources were devoted to an activity judged unproductive by Verner, something they propose possibly contributed to the decline of the Old Kingdom. The main beneficiaries of these sacrifices were the cult's priests, who consumed the offerings after the required ceremonies.\n\nThe funerary cult of Neferefre seems to have ceased at the end of the Old Kingdom or during the First Intermediate Period. Traces of a possible revival of the cult during the later Middle Kingdom are scant and ambiguous. During the Twelfth Dynasty, a certain Khuyankh was buried in the funerary temple of Neferefre. It remains unclear if this was to associate himself closely with the deceased ruler or because other cultic activities in the area constrained the choice of location for Khuyankh's tomb.\n"}

This was a generation after the emancipation of the Jews in Central European German-speaking lands and during a time of relative tolerance. First educated locally, Jadassohn enrolled at the Leipzig Conservatory in 1848, just a few years after it had been founded by Felix Mendelssohn. There he studied composition with Moritz Hauptmann, Ernst Richter and Julius Rietz, as well as piano with Ignaz Moscheles. At the same time, he studied privately with Franz Liszt in Weimar. On 13 April 1851 in Weimar he was the soloist at the first performance, under Liszt's baton, of Liszt's arrangement for piano and orchestra of Carl Maria von Weber's \"Polonaise (Polacca) brillante\" \"L'hilarité\" in E major, Op. 72.\n\nBecause he was Jewish, Jadassohn could not qualify for the many church jobs as music directors or organists which were usually available to Christian graduates of a conservatory such as Leipzig, as they required deep knowledge of Christian liturgy and practice. Instead he worked for a Leipzig synagogue and a few local choral societies as well as teaching privately. Eventually, he was able to qualify for a position at the Leipzig Conservatory, teaching piano and composition.\n\nOver the years, he became a renowned teacher, and Edvard Grieg, Ferruccio Busoni, Frederick Delius, Paul Homeyer, Richard Franck, Sigfrid Karg-Elert, Ruben Liljefors, Emil Reznicek and Felix Weingartner, Bernard Zweers and Cornelis Dopper were among his many students. Americans also studied with him, including the song composer Jean Paul Kürsteiner and George Strong, a composer of the late 19th and early 20th century. He died in Leipzig, aged 70.\n\nHis daughter Bertha was married to operetta composer Leo Fall.\n\nJadassohn composed more than 140 works in virtually every genre, including four symphonies, four Serenades for Orchestra and one for Flute and String Orchestra, two piano concertos, lieder, sonatas, opera and a considerable amount of chamber music, including a string quartet, four piano trios, three piano quartets, three piano quintets and a serenade for flute and string quintet. These chamber works rank among his finest compositions. Considered a master of counterpoint and harmony, he was also a gifted melodist, following in the tradition of Mendelssohn. His works also show the influence of Wagner and Liszt, whose music deeply impressed him. In addition, he wrote several important books on composition and music theory.\n\nThe general consensus is that Jadassohn and his music were not better known for two reasons: the first is the pre-eminence of his contemporary Carl Reinecke. Reinecke was a world-famous piano virtuoso and composer, but also an important professor at the Leipzig Conservatory, where Jadassohn taught. Reinecke later served as its director and, at the same time, held the post of conductor of the renowned Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra.\n\nThe second reason was the influence of the rising tide of antisemitism in late 19th century Wilhelmine Germany. In the wake of Wagner, many music critics attacked Jadassohn's works, labeling it academic and dry, epithets which have stuck with it since.\nSince his death, his music has been seldom performed, but in the 21st century, a reevaluation of it has begun with new performances and recordings. Cameo Classics commenced a programme of recording his neglected orchestral works. His Symphony No.1 was recorded with the Belarusian SSO with Marius Stravinsky conducting. Concerto for Piano and Orchestra No. 1 Op. 89 in C minor was performed to acclaim at a public premiere (since his death) by soloist Valentina Seferinova and the Karelia State Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Denis Vlasenko in Petrozavodsk, Russia on 20 December 2008. A CD including these works was issued by Cameo Classics in January 2009. Jadassohn composed four Serenades for Orchestra and the first three received their premiere recordings from Cameo Classics in 2011, along with his Serenade for Flute and Strings (Soloist Rebecca Hall) with the Malta Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nHyperion Records released a recording of Jadassohn's two piano concertos.\n\nThe record label cpo has released recordings of the four symphonies and both cavatinas by the Brandenburgisches Staatsorchester Frankfurt conducted by Howard Griffiths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1918, the fleet was inherited by the Russian SFSR then the Soviet Union in 1922, where it formed part of the Soviet Navy and was awarded the Order of the Red Banner in 1945. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Caspian Flotilla and most of its vessels were inherited by the Russian Federation.\n\nThe Caspian Flotilla's headquarters are located in Astrakhan, but were historically in Baku (now in Azerbaijan) from 1867 until 1991, with additional facilities in Makhachkala (HQ being moved there) and Kaspiysk. The current commander is Rear Admiral Sergey Pinchuk.\n\nThe Caspian Flotilla (CF) was created in November 1722 in Astrakhan by the order of Peter the Great. Led by the admiral Fyodor Apraksin, it participated in Peter's Persian campaign of 1722–1723 and the Russo-Persian War (1804–1813), assisting the Russian army in capturing Derbent and Baku during the Persian Expedition of 1796. As a result of the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813, the CF remained the only military flotilla in the Caspian Sea. Baku became its main base in 1867.\n\nAs the situation on the Caspian Sea stabilized in due course, the number of ships in the CF began to decrease. By the beginning of the 20th century, it had two gunboats and a few armed steamers. The sailors of the CF were actively engaged in the revolutionary movement in Baku in 1903–1905 and establishment of the Soviet authority in 1917 in that region. In order to provide assistance to the Red Army, they formed the Military Fleet of the Astrakhan Region (\"Военный флот Астраханского края\", or Voyenniy flot Astrakhanskogo kraya) in April – June 1918, reinforced with torpedo boats and submarines from the Baltic Sea in the fall of 1918. On October 13, the Soviets renamed it to the Astrakhan-Caspian Military Flotilla (\"Астрахано-Каспийская военная флотилия\", or Astrakhano-Kaspiyskaya voennaya flotiliya). The ships of the flotilla were captured by the counterrevolutionary Centrocaspian Dictatorship in August 1918 and later regained by the Soviets after the overthrow of the Musavat government.\n\nIn July 1919, the Astrakhan-Caspian Military Flotilla was combined with the Volga Military Flotilla (Волжская военная флотилия, or Volzhskaya voyennaya flotiliya) and renamed to the Volga-Caspian Military Flotilla (Волжско-Каспийская военная флотилия). On May 1, 1920, the Soviets established the Caspian Fleet, which comprised three auxiliary cruisers, ten torpedo boats, four submarines and other ships. Together with the Caspian Fleet, there was the Red Fleet of the Soviet Azerbaijan, stationed in Baku, as well. Both fleets completed the conquest of the Caspian Sea from the White Army. In July 1920, Caspian and Azerbaijani fleets were combined into the Naval Forces of the Caspian Sea (\"Морские Силы Каспийского моря\", or Morskiye Sily Kaspiyskogo morya) and would later be renamed to the Caspian Flotilla on June 27, 1931.\n\nDuring the Great Patriotic War of 1941–1945, the Caspian Flotilla secured vital sea shipping of army units, military equipment and different cargo, especially during the Battle of Stalingrad and the battle for the Caucasus. (During the war, some of the Lend Lease were shipped to the USSR via the Persian Corridor and the Caspian Sea).\n\nDuring the Cold War the Caspian Flotilla was used to test missile armed ekranoplanes.\n\nFollowing the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, the fleet shrank, and the Kazakh contingent was removed to serve as a basis for Kazakhstan's naval service. For several years, Russia continued to lead a joint Turkmen-Russian force based at Astrakhan.\n\nAmong the Flotilla's units, from 2000, has been a new Naval Infantry brigade, the 77th, based at Kaspiysk. The headquarters and two battalions of the brigade were scheduled to be established by August 1, 2000. It was reported by the AVN Military News Agency in June 2000 that the new brigade, which had inherited the lineage of the disbanded 77th Guards Motor Rifle Division, formerly with the Northern Fleet, was to have its troops housed in Kaspiysk and Astrakhan and have as many as 195 combat vehicles and one Gepard class frigate sent to it from Chukotka and the Northern Fleet, respectively. The brigade was also to have helicopters added to it, according to the June 2000 report. The Brigade's full name was the 77th Detached Guards Moscow-Chernigov Order of Lenin, the Red Banner, Order of Suvorov Marine Brigade. It was disbanded in 2009.\n\nThe brigade comprised a headquarters at Kaspiysk; the 414th Detached Naval Infantry Battalion (Kaspiysk); the 725th Detached Naval Infantry Battalion (Kaspiysk); the 727th Detached Naval Infantry Battalion (Astrakhan); the 1200th Detached Reconnaissance Battalion (Kaspiysk); the 1408th Independent Howitzer Artillery Battalion; the 1409th Independent Howitzer Artillery Battalion; the 975th Detached Naval Infantry Battalion (Kaspiysk); the 1387th Detached Air Defence Missile and Artillery Battalion; and the 530th Detached Electronic Countermeasures Company.\nAlso, the flotilla has received 3 new \"Buyan\"-class stealth type river gunboats built by the St. Petersburg Almaz shipyard.\nOn 13 and 23 November 2009, there were two separate sets of explosions at the 31st Arsenal of the Caspian Sea Flotilla, an ammunition depot, in Ulyanovsk. Ten servicemen died. The depot was to be closed.\n\nThe first Russian warship equipped with the Caliber missile system entered service with Caspian Flotilla in 2012.

The tap itself is typically a dedicated hardware device, which provides a way to access the data flowing across a computer network. In many cases, it is desirable for a third party to monitor the traffic between two points in the network. If the network between points A and B consists of a physical cable, a \"network tap\" may be the best way to accomplish this monitoring. The network tap has (at least) three ports: an A port, a B port, and a monitor port. A tap inserted between A and B passes all traffic (send and receive data streams) through unimpeded in real time, but also copies that same data to its monitor port, enabling a third party to listen.\nNetwork taps are commonly used for network intrusion detection systems, VoIP recording, network probes, RMON probes, packet sniffers, and other monitoring and collection devices and software that require access to a network segment. Taps are used in security applications because they are non-obtrusive, are not detectable on the network (having no physical or logical address), can deal with full-duplex and non-shared networks, and will usually \"pass through\" or \"bypass\" traffic even if the tap stops working or loses power.\n=Terminology=\nThe term network tap is analogous to phone tap or vampire tap. Some vendors define \"TAP\" as an acronym for \"Test Access Point\" or \"Terminal Access Point\"; however, those are most likely bacronyms.\n\nThe monitored traffic is sometimes referred to as the \"pass-through\" traffic, while the ports that are used for monitoring are the \"monitor\" ports. There may also be an aggregation port for full-duplex traffic, wherein the \"A\" traffic is aggregated with the \"B\" traffic, resulting in one stream of data /packets for monitoring the full-duplex communication. The packets must be aligned into a single stream using a time-of-arrival algorithm.\n\nVendors will tend to use terms in their marketing such as \"breakout\", \"passive\", \"aggregating\", \"regeneration\", bypass, active, \"inline power\", and others; Unfortunately, vendors do not use such terms consistently. Before buying any product it is important to understand the available features, and check with vendors or read the product literature closely to figure out how marketing terms correspond to reality. All of the \"vendor terms\" are common within the industry, have real definitions and are valuable points of consideration when buying a tap device.\n\nA distributed tap is a set of network taps that report to a centralized monitoring system or packet analyzer.\n\n=Tapping technology methods=\nThere are various methods for monitoring a network. Many tapping methods can be used, according to the network technology, the monitoring objective, the resources avaible and the size of the target network. Varius methods will be developed below.\n\nThis type of tapping focuses on tapping by making use of Software, and without making any significant change on an infrastructures hardware. This type of Tapping is often the cheapest one to implement, but it needs several implementations to give a truly complete look of the network.\n\nThe simplest type of monitoring is logging into an interesting device and running programs or commands that show performance statistics and other data. This is the cheapest way to monitor a network, and is highly appropriate for small networks. However, it does not scale well to large networks. It can also impact the network being monitored; see observer effect.\n\nAnother way to monitor devices is to use a remote management protocol such as SNMP to ask devices about their performance. This scales well, but is not necessarily appropriate for all types of monitoring. The inherent problems with SNMP are the polling effect. Many vendors have alleviated this by using intelligent polling schedulers, but this may still affect the performance of the device being monitored. It also opens up a host of potential security problems.\n\nAnother method to monitor networks is to use port mirroring (called \"SPAN\", for Switched Port Analyzer, by vendors such as Cisco, and given other names, such MLXe telemetry by Brocade Communications and other vendors)(also known as MIRROR port) or a monitoring protocol such as TZSP on routers and switches. This is a low-cost alternative to network taps, and solves many of the same problems. However, not all routers and switches support port mirroring and, on those that do, using port mirroring can affect the performance of the router or switch. These technologies may also be subject to the problem with full-duplex described elsewhere in this article, and there are often limits for the router or switch on how many pass-through sessions can be monitored, or how many monitor ports (generally two) can monitor a given session.\nThis is a low-cost alternative to traditional network tap methods.\nOften, when the SPAN port is overloaded, packets will be dropped before reaching the monitoring device. There is also the possibility of losing some of the error packets that may be causing problems. If this data is not sent to the monitoring device because it is dropped, it is impossible to troubleshoot, no matter how advanced a device that may be used.\n\nThis tapping method consists in enabling Promiscuous Mode on the device that is used for the monitoring and attaching it to a network switch. This works well with older LAN technologies such as 10BASE-T Ethernet, FDDI, and token ring. On such networks, any host can automatically see what all other hosts were doing by enabling promiscuous mode. However, modern switched network technologies such as those used on modern Ethernets provide, in effect, point-to-point links between pairs of devices, so it is hard for other devices to see traffic.\nThis type of tapping focuses on tapping with remarkable use of hardware\n\nThis method consists in the installation of a device in between a network cable and the device the Admin/Attacker wishes to \"tap\". When a monitoring device is installed in-line, the network will stop every time the device fails, or shutsdown. The \"victim\" device might stop receiving traffic when the \"tapping-device\" is updating/rebooting if said mechanisms weren't integrated in a smart way (aka. that would prevent this scenario from happening).\n\nSome taps, particularly fiber taps, use no power and no electronics at all for the \"pass-through\" and \"monitor\" portion of the network traffic. This means that the tap should never suffer any kind of electronics failure or power failure that results in a loss of network connectivity. One way this can work, for fiber-based network technologies, is that the tap divides the incoming light using a simple physical apparatus into two outputs, one for the \"pass-through\", one for the \"monitor\". This can be called a \"passive\" tap. Other taps use no power or electronics for the \"pass-through\", but do use power and electronics for the \"monitor\" port. These can also be referred to as \"passive\".\n\nV-Line Tapping is the most important Tapping system methods. V-Line Tapping (also known as Bypass Tapping) allows placing the served system virtually in-line. Putting this device in-line will compromise the integrity of a critical network. By placing a Tapping system instead of the monitoring device and connecting the monitoring device to the Tapping system, it can guarantee that the traffic will continue to flow and the device will not create a failure point in the network. This method always passes every packet, even error packets that a SPAN port may drop, to the monitoring device. This method involves using spying-software on the target machine. For a system-admin, this type of solution is the easiest to implement and the most cost-effective one; However, for an attacker, this type of tapping is very risky, as this is easily detectable by system scans. The tapping system will be removed after a reboot if the spying software was installed in a non-persistent way on a system that is executing a Live-OS.\n\n=Advantages and features=\nModern network technologies are often full-duplex, meaning that data can travel in both directions at the same time. If a network link allows 100 Mbit/s of data to flow in each direction at the same time, this means that the network really allows 200 Mbit/s of aggregate throughput. This can present a problem for monitoring technologies if they have only one monitor port. Therefore, network taps for full-duplex technologies usually have two monitor ports, one for each half of the connection. The listener must use channel bonding or link aggregation to merge the two connections into one aggregate interface to see both halves of the traffic. Other monitoring technologies, such as passive fiber network TAPs do not deal well with the full-duplex traffic.\n\nOnce a network tap is in place, the network can be monitored without interfering with the network itself. Other network monitoring solutions require in-band changes to network devices, which means that monitoring can impact the devices being monitored. This scenario is for active, inline security tools, such as next-generation fire walls, intrusion prevention systems and web application firewalls.\n\nOnce a tap is in place, a monitoring device can be connected to it as-needed without impacting the monitored network.\n\nSome taps have multiple output ports, or multiple pairs of output ports for full-duplex, to allow more than one device to monitor the network at the tap point. These are often called \"regeneration\" taps.\n\nSome taps operate at the physical layer of the OSI model rather than the data link layer. For example, they work with multi-mode fiber rather than 1000BASE-SX. This means that they can work with most data link network technologies that use that physical media, such as ATM and some forms of Ethernet. Network taps that act as simple optical splitters, sometimes called \"passive taps\" (although that term is not used consistently) can have this property.\n\nSome network taps offer both duplication of network traffic for monitoring devices and SNMP services. Most major network tap manufacturers offer taps with remote management through Telnet, HTTP, or SNMP interfaces. Such network tap hybrids can be helpful to network managers who wish to view baseline performance statistics without diverting existing tools. Alternatively, SNMP alarms generated by managed taps can alert network managers to link conditions that merit examination by analyzers to intrusion detection systems.\n\nSome taps get some of their power (i.e., for the \"pass-through\") or all of their power (i.e., for both \"pass-through\" and \"monitor\") from the network itself. These can be referred to as having \"inline power\".\n\nSome taps can also reproduce low-level network errors, such as short frames, bad CRC or corrupted data.\n\nHere are some advantages of a Network TAP over port mirroring or SPAN:\n\n\nBecause network taps require additional hardware, they are not as cheap as technologies that use capabilities that are built into the network. However, network taps are easier to manage and normally provide more data than some network devices.\n\nNetwork taps can require channel bonding on monitoring devices to get around the problem with full-duplex discussed above. Vendors usually refer to this as aggregation as well.\n\nPutting a network tap into place will disrupt the network being monitored for a short time. Even so, a short disruption is preferable to taking a network down multiple times to deploy a monitoring tool. Establishing good guidelines for the placement of network taps is recommended.\n\nMonitoring large networks using network taps can require a lot of monitoring devices. High-end networking devices often allow ports to be enabled as mirror ports, which is a software network tap. While any free port can be configured as a mirror port, software taps require configuration and place load on the network devices.\n\nEven fully \"passive\" network taps introduce new points of failure into the network. There are several ways that taps can cause problems, and this should be considered when creating a tap architecture. Consider non-powered taps for optical-only environments or \"throwing star network tap\" for copper 100BT. This allows you to modify the intelligent aggregation taps that may be in use and avoids any complications when upgrading from 100 megabit to gigabit to 10 gigabit. Redundant power supplies are highly recommended.\n\nFully \"passive\" is only possible on optical connections any bandwidth and on copper connections from type G703 (2Mbit) and Ethernet Base-T 10/100 Mbit. On Gigabit and 10 Gbit Base-T connections passive tapping is currently not possible.\n=Countermeasures=\nCountermeasures for network taps include encryption and alarm systems. Encryption can make the stolen data unintelligible to the thief. However, encryption can be an expensive solution, and there are also concerns about network bandwidth when it is used.\n\nAnother counter-measure is to deploy a fiber-optic sensor into the existing raceway, conduit or armored cable. In this scenario, anyone attempting to physically access the data (copper or fiber infrastructure) is detected by the alarm system. A small number of alarm systems manufacturers provide a simple way to monitor the optical fiber for physical intrusion disturbances. There is also a proven solution that utilizes existing dark (unused) fiber in a multi-strand cable for the purpose of creating an alarm system.\n\nIn the alarmed cable scenario, the sensing mechanism uses optical interferometry in which modally dispersive coherent light traveling through the multi-mode fiber mixes at the fiber's terminus, resulting in a characteristic pattern of light and dark splotches called speckle. The laser speckle is stable as long as the fiber remains immobile, but flickers when the fiber is vibrated. A fiber-optic sensor works by measuring the time dependence of this speckle pattern and applying digital signal processing to the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the temporal data.\n\nThe U.S. government has been concerned about the tapping threat for many years, and it also has a concern about other forms of intentional or accidental physical intrusion. In the context of classified information Department of Defense (DOD) networks, Protected Distribution Systems (PDS) is a set of military instructions and guidelines for network physical protection. PDS is defined for a system of carriers (raceways, conduits, ducts, etc.) that are used to distribute Military and National Security Information (NSI) between two or more controlled areas or from a controlled area through an area of lesser classification (i.e., outside the SCIF or other similar area). National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Instruction (NSTISSI) No. 7003, Protective Distribution Systems (PDS), provides guidance for the protection of SIPRNET wire line and optical fiber PDS to transmit unencrypted classified National Security Information (NSI).\n=Gigabit Base-T issues=\n\nTo transport 1 Gbit of traffic full duplex (1 Gbit in each direction simultaneously) a very complex signal is used to reach the desired performance and quality. In case of Gbit Ethernet the signal is called PAM 5 modulation, meaning that each cable pair transports 5 bits simultaneously in both directions. The PHY chips at each end of the cable have a very complex task at hand, because they must separate the two signals from each other. This is only possible because they know their own signal, so they can deduct their own send signals from the mixed signals on the line and then interpret the information sent by their link partners.\n\nTo tap a copper link as shown in the picture above it is not possible to just tap the middle of the wire because all you will see is a complex modulation of two signals. The only way to terminate the signal (as shown in the picture) is to use a PHY chip to separate the signal and then send the signal on to the link partner. This solution is working but causes some other problems.\n\n\n=See also=\n\n=References=\n=External links=\n"}

The 2006 sale of the Shinawatra family's share caused controversy in Thailand. The sale was in response to long-standing criticisms that the Shinawatra family's holdings created a conflict of interest for Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Critics of the sale focused on allegations directed toward Thaksin and a compliant government that the transaction was exempt from capital gains tax, the fact that the Thai company was sold to a Singaporean company, and the fact that the Thai law regarding foreign investments in the telecom sector had been amended just prior to the sale.\n\nThe company is linked by stock control to companies including Shin Satellite and Advanced Info Service.

It takes its name from the town of Mâcon. It is best known as a source of good value white wines made from the Chardonnay grape; the wines from Pouilly-Fuissé are particularly sought-after. Almost all the wine made in the Mâconnais is white wine. Chardonnay is the main grape grown in the district—in fact, there is a village of that name in the far north of the region. Some plantations of Gamay and Pinot noir are made into red and rosé Mâcon, making up no more than 30% of the total wine production. Gamay is grown in the Beaujolais cru of Moulin-à-Vent, which extends into the Mâconnais, but has little in common with the wines north of the border.\n\nThe geology is similar to that of the Côte d'Or, but the gentle relief means that vines are mixed with other forms of farming in most of the area. In the south the land rises up to form Mont de Pouilly and other limestone hills, covered in the alkaline clay that best suits Chardonnay. The villages of Vergisson, Solutré-Pouilly, Fuissé and Chaintré shelter at their feet, and are home to the best wines of the region.\n\nMâcon was a major crossroads in Roman times, and grapes would have been brought by the Romans if they were not already cultivated by the Celts. Viticulture was further encouraged by local religious foundations; the province was dominated by the bishopric of Mâcon during the Dark Ages. \n\nThe region formed the border between the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire from 843-1600 and grew rich on customs duties in that time. A secular Count of Mâcon is not recorded until after 850; from 926 the countship became hereditary. The last Count of Mâcon and of Vienne died in 1224 and the lands passed to his daughter, Alix de Bourgogne (Alice of Burgundy); when her husband died in 1239, she sold the Mâconnais to Louis IX of France. The 1435 Treaty of Arras saw Charles VII of France cede it to Philip, Duke of Burgundy, but in 1477 it reverted to France, upon the death of duke Charles the Bold. Emperor Charles V definitively recognized the Mâconnais as French at the Treaty of Cambrai in 1529.\n\nAfter the fall of the Bastille in 1789, the mountain peasants of Mâconnais revolted. Many were executed by the urban militias of Mâcon, Cluny and Tournus after much brigandage.\n\nMâconnais consists of the following appellations. The regional Burgundy appellations - Bourgogne, Bourgogne Aligoté, Coteaux Bourguignons, Bourgogne Passe-tout-grains, Crémant de Bourgogne, Bourgogne mousseux - may also be used for wine from this area.\n\nThe following rules apply to the different wines from the Mâcon appellation:\n\nIn 2010, the total Mâconnais vineyards covered .

It was co-produced by Dodi Fayed and written and directed by Brian Gibson.\n\nInitial finance of £30,000 (used for development) was provided by Goldcrest Films. This was reimbursed by the company when Dodi Fayed put up the entire budget of $3 million. Goldcrest and Allied (Fayed's company) would later work together on \"Chariots of Fire\".\n\nThe film was screened out of competition at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe soundtrack album, featuring songs performed by O'Connor, reached number 5 in the UK and was certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry. Two singles, \"Eighth Day\" and \"Will You\", both reached the UK Top 10.\n\nThe film depicts the rise and fall of Kate (Hazel O'Connor), an angry but creative young singer and songwriter. At the beginning of the film, she is discovered by Danny (Phil Daniels), a young man who desperately wants to become a promoter of music bands but is stuck working for another agent (who forces him to buy hundreds of copies of the singles of one of his artists, Suzie Sapphire, to fix the music charts). Danny takes an active part in controlling Kate's career, impressed with her talent if not her band, whom he promptly fires. He arranges auditions and reaches out to former friends, and in doing so Kate's new band, Breaking Glass, is formed. Breaking Glass consists of Kate on vocals and keyboard, best friends Tony (Mark Wingett) and Dave (Gary Tibbs) on lead and bass guitar respectively, the drug-addicted and partially deaf Ken (Jonathan Pryce) on saxophone and the 'mental' Mick (Peter-Hugo Daly) on drums.\n\nDanny does his best to promote the band but finds it hard-going. The best he can do is several nights in a pub frequented by neo-nazis, which, given Kate's anarchist and liberal tendencies that shine through in her songwriting, doesn't go well. After a brawl breaks out one night and the publican refuses to pay the band, Danny finally manages to persuade the anti-establishment Kate to record a demo tape. Danny and Kate then take the demo tape to a gig promoter who shows no interest.\n\nThe band keeps struggling to get by, despite being hassled by the police, and in the meantime Kate realises she is falling in love with Danny. The hard work eventually pays off when the gig promoter finally agrees to help out, but only by offering the band a contract that Danny describes as \"feudal\".\n\nSeveral months pass as the band tours the country, building up a large fanbase. On Christmas Eve the band is stranded when their van breaks down and the British Rail train drivers are on strike. It is at this point that Danny and Kate kiss for the first time and become a couple.\n\nDanny blackmails his former employer (by threatening to reveal how he paid Danny to rig the charts) into attending a gig in London. However, disaster strikes when the band begins to perform and a power-cut occurs. Encouraged by Danny and Mick, the band continues anyway and wins the hostile crowd over. Their performance greatly impresses the music agents Danny forced into coming, and the band is offered a record contract.\n\nAlmost immediately things do not go well. Firstly, the band are not amused by how the music agents demand changes to some of the 'offensive' lyrics to secure airplay (such as changing 'kick him in the arse' to 'punch him in the nose'). The recording of the first album does not go well and the agents also reveal that they think Danny is the problem. The chart rise of \"Top of the Wheel\", the band's first single, parallels the earlier success of Suzie Sapphire.\n\nForced into playing at an anti-establishment benefit concert, the band finds the organisation lacking and tries to leave, only to see a neo-nazi rally approaching. They decide to play anyway (and a particularly controversial song), which results in a riot breaking out. Danny wants the band to leave but Kate insists on taunting the crowd. That changes when a young man who has been stabbed falls right in front of her, screaming in pain and desperation. This causes Kate to scream.\n\nWhile recovering, Kate is forced to audition for a famous music manager, Woods (Jon Finch), who makes it clear that he wants to produce her music and also be involved with her. Kate's new songs seem to help her recover mentally, but the rest of the band are not so happy. Danny finds himself being pushed more and more into the sidelines and Ken has no part to play on the big new single.\n\nOn tour again, the agents start sowing seeds of discontent among the band, hinting heavily that Danny is the problem. This leads to a confrontation on the tour bus after which Danny storms out and quits. Woods now moves in as the band's manager and becomes Kate's new lover.\n\nAfter much more success, including a platinum record, the band keeps falling apart. Mick quits, claiming to be bored. Kate hates the pressures and lack of control that fame has brought her. Dave and Tony treat Ken terribly, hating him for being a junkie, and force him to quit the band too. By now the band's name has changed to \"Kate & Breaking Glass\".\n\nDuring a radio show which invites listeners to call in, Kate has trouble understanding her fans and gets angry when she is accused of being controlled by her record company, and even more so when someone she thinks is Danny calls in to accuse her of selling out. The next single released is \"Big Brother\", which features the 'offensive' lyrics completely changed as the music agents originally wanted, proving she has indeed sold out.\n\nMick and Ken meet with Danny and accuse him of abandoning them and ruining the band. But all the same they plead with him to come back and help Kate, but he refuses.\n\nThe film ends with a huge concert and the debut of a new song, although already drugged Kate is forced to go on stage by Woods, who forcibly holds her down while a doctor injects her with more drugs. Kate goes on with the band, performing the song \"Eighth Day\" (the US release of the film ends the movie after the song). After the song Kate flees the stage into the London Underground, where she begins hallucinating people dressed as her and her former bandmates, and has a nervous breakdown.\n\nThe final scene shows Kate recuperating at a hospital, Danny comes to visit her and to bring her a synthesizer.\n\n\n"}

This leaves the immune system \"trapped\" by the first response it has made to each antigen, and unable to mount potentially more effective responses during subsequent infections. The phenomenon of original antigenic sin has been described in relation to influenza virus, dengue fever, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and to several other viruses.\n\nThis phenomenon was first described in 1960 by Thomas Francis, Jr. in the article \"On the Doctrine of Original Antigenic Sin\". It is named by analogy to the theological concept of original sin. According to Thomas Francis, who originally described the idea, and cited by Richard Krause:\n\n\"The antibody of childhood is largely a response to dominant antigen of the virus causing the first type A influenza infection of the lifetime. [...] The imprint established by the original virus infection governs the antibody response thereafter. This we have called the Doctrine of the Original Antigenic Sin.\"\n\nDuring a primary infection, long-lived memory B cells are generated, which remain in the body, and provide protection from subsequent infections. These memory B cells respond to specific epitopes on the surface of viral proteins in order to produce antigen-specific antibodies, and are able to respond to infection much faster than B cells are able to respond to novel antigens. This effect shortens the amount of time required to clear subsequent infections.\n\nBetween primary and secondary infections, or following vaccination, a virus may undergo antigenic drift, in which the viral surface proteins (the epitopes) are altered through natural mutation, allowing the virus to escape the immune system. When this happens, the altered virus preferentially reactivates previously activated high-affinity memory B cells and spur antibody production. However, the antibodies produced by these B cells generally ineffectively bind to the altered epitopes. In addition, these antibodies inhibit the activation of higher-affinity naive B cells that \"would\" be able to make more effective antibodies to the second virus. This leads to a less effective immune response and recurrent infections may take longer to clear.\n\nOriginal antigenic sin is of particular importance in the application of vaccines. In dengue fever, the effect of original antigenic sin has important implications for vaccine development. Once a response against a dengue virus serotype has been established, it is unlikely that vaccination against a second will be effective, implying that balanced responses against all four virus serotypes have to be established with the first vaccine dose. However, in 2015, a new class of highly potent, neutralizing antibodies that is effective against all four virus serotypes has been isolated, bringing hope for the development of a universal dengue vaccine.\n\nThe specificity and the quality of the immune response against novel strains of influenza is often diminished in individuals who are repeatedly immunized (by vaccination or recurrent infections). However, the impact of antigenic sin on protection has not been well established, and appears to differ with each infectious agent vaccine, geographic location, and age. Researchers found reduced antibody responses to the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccine in individuals who had been vaccinated against the seasonal A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1) within the previous three months.\n\nA similar phenomenon has been described in cytotoxic T cells (CTL). It has been demonstrated that during a second infection by a different strain of dengue virus, the CTLs prefer to release cytokines instead of causing cell lysis. As a result, the production of these cytokines is thought to increase vascular permeability and exacerbate damage to endothelial cells.\n\nSeveral groups have attempted to design vaccines for HIV and hepatitis C based on induction of CTL response. The finding that the CTL response may be biased by original antigenic sin may help to explain the limited effectiveness of these vaccines. Viruses like HIV are highly variable and undergo mutation frequently; due to original antigenic sin, HIV infection induced by viruses that express slightly different epitopes (than those in a viral vaccine) would fail to be controlled by the vaccine. In fact, the vaccine might make the infection even worse, by \"trapping\" the immune response into the first, ineffective, response it made against the virus.\n\n"}

The Bacharachs became a top independent team within a few years, featuring shortstop Dick Lundy, third baseman Oliver Marcell, and the great pitchers Dick Redding and Jesse \"Nip\" Winters.\n\nIn 1920 the club joined the Midwest-based Negro National League (NNL) as an associate member. Though the Bacharachs played NNL teams extensively, touring the Midwest each year from 1920 to 1922, they did not compete for the league championship. In 1922, the club splintered into two factions; one took most of the roster and moved to New York City under the management of John Henry Lloyd, while the other remained in Atlantic City.\n\nIn 1923, the two clubs were reunited in Atlantic City, and the Bacharach Giants became a founding member of the Eastern Colored League (ECL). The team hovered around .500 until 1926, when the shortstop Dick Lundy took over as playing manager, and brought home two consecutive pennants, helped by Marcelle, center fielder Chaney White, and pitchers Arthur \"Rats\" Henderson, Claude Grier, and Luther Farrell. The Bacharachs lost the Negro League World Series to the Chicago American Giants both years, though Grier and Farrell both tossed no-hitters for the Atlantic City team, the only no-hitters in Negro League World Series history. When the ECL failed early in 1928, the Bacharachs continued to play as an independent team.\n\nDespite the Bacharachs' success, attendance was not high enough to sustain their high-priced roster. In one of the most famous trades in Negro league history, they sent Lundy and Marcelle to the Baltimore Black Sox in return for veteran first baseman and manager Ben Taylor, catcher Mack Eggleston, and cash. Lundy and Marcelle sparked the Black Sox to the 1929 American Negro League pennant, while the Bacharachs languished in fifth place (out of six teams), with a 19–45 record. The team disbanded after the 1929 season and its connection to Atlantic City ended.\n\nIn 1931, white promoter Harry Passon organized a new Bacharach team based in Philadelphia. The club eventually joined Gus Greenlee's new Negro National League in 1934 but returned to independent baseball in 1935. The Bacharachs then operated independently until Passon's death in 1942 and then disbanded for good.\n\n"}

Da Costa became infamous for embezzling funds while working at the Royal Society and was imprisoned.\n\nDa Costa came from a Sephardi family that had moved to England in the 1600s from the Iberian peninsula. His parents were Abraham and Esther (with the Christian names of John and Joanna). Abraham is thought to have been in the diamond business. A brother became a wealthy businessman but Emanuel worked in the office of a notary and qualified from the Scriveners' Company in 1762 but had taken an interest in natural history from around 1736. He began to trade in shells, corals and fossils and corresponded with Linnaeus, Sir Hans Sloane and other naturalists of the period. Da Costa was elected one of the first Jewish Fellows of the Royal Society of London in 1747, sponsored by Martin Folkes, the Duke of Montagu, and others. In 1750 da Costa married a cousin Leah whose brother Abraham del Prado was a wealthy contractor for the English army, supplying food. Earlier around 1740 Abraham had employed da Costa in the Netherlands but this led to unpaid debts and resulted in da Costa's imprisonment for two years. In 1763 the death of Francis Hauksbee, who had served for forty years as clerk to the Royal Society led to an opening that he bid for by enlisting the votes and endorsements from his friends and correspondents. He was appointed clerk, librarian and keeper of the repository and housekeeper of the Royal Society. In 1767 he was discovered to be withholding members' subscription fees, was convicted of fraud, and sentenced to five years in debtors' prison. The issue was detected when John Hope was listed as an annual instead of perpetual member and sought investigation. Da Costa would release the annual membership amount to the Royal Society but draw interest from the remainder of the life membership subscription. After release he struggled to make a living lecturing about fossils, and dealing in shells and minerals. His last scientific publication was \"British Conchology\" (1778) which included an autobiographical preface. Some friends remained loyal even after his imprisonment. These included Ingham Forster (1725-82) brother of Jacob Forster (1739-1806).

He was taken to Australia as a baby, where his father toured with musical comedies. The young Franklyn attended Wesley and Haileybury Colleges, both in Melbourne, and developed an abiding love of cricket. He later trialled as a fast bowler for Essex, and opened the bowling for the Stage Cricket Club. He also became a leg spinner, and ran his own team, the Sargentmen, raising money for the Malcolm Sargent Cancer Fund for Children.\n\nHe returned to London, aged 11.

It has been used for centuries as a folk remedy to promote the healing of wounds and as a remedy for respiratory tract and digestive system problems. It is still promoted as a dietary supplement, and additional claims have been made that it can treat other maladies such as cancer, HIV, radiation illness, swine flu, and the common cold. To date, none of these claims has been medically validated and shark liver oil (alone) is not a medication prescribed or utilized by American physicians. However, it is a component of some moisturizing skin lotions and hemorrhoid medications.\n\nMany fish maintain buoyancy with swim bladders. However sharks lack swim bladders, and maintain their buoyancy instead with large livers that are full of oil. This stored oil may also function as a nutrient when food is scarce. Deep sea sharks are usually targeted for their oil, because the livers of these species can account for up to 5-10% of their total weight.\n\nA principal component of many shark oils is squalene, a triterpenoid (CH), ranging up to 90% of the oil, depending on the species. In Centrophorus species squalene may account for 15% of the total body weight. Pristane, another terpenoid (CH), is often a minor component, ranging up to nearly 8% of the oil.\n\nMost shark liver oil supplements have not been tested to find out if they interact with medicines, foods, or other herbs and supplements. Even though some reports of interactions and harmful effects may be published, full studies of interactions and effects are not often available. Although many people have taken shark liver oil, the issue of potential toxicity at the usual doses has not been well studied. Some mild digestive problems such as nausea, upset stomach, and diarrhea have been reported. The safe range of doses for shark liver oil has not yet being determined, though overdosing can have toxic consequences.\n\nSome animal studies have found that shark liver oil and its components may raise blood cholesterol levels. A Japanese study found some shark liver oil supplements to be contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). PCBs can have harmful effects in humans, and may increase the risk of some types of cancer. People with seafood allergies may also react to shark liver oil.\n\nShark liver oil has been misleadingly promoted as a treatment for cancer. In addition, it has been confused with the word \"Charcoal\" in multiple translations. Despite claims that the alkoxy-glycerols derived from shark liver oil could reduce tumor growth, there is not sufficient evidence to prove this to be a viable treatment option.\n\nTraditionally, the people of Bermuda rely on shark-oil based \"barometers\" to predict storms and other severe weather. Small bottles of oil are hung outside. If the bottle is clear then the weather will be good, if it's cloudy then take cover.\n"}

The show's married protagonists, portrayed by Don Ameche and Frances Langford, spent nearly all their time together in relentless verbal war.\n\n\"The Bickersons\" was created by Philip Rapp, the one-time Eddie Cantor writer who had also created the Fanny Brice skits (for \"The Ziegfeld Follies of the Air\" and \"Maxwell House Coffee Time\") that grew into radio's \"Baby Snooks\". Several years after the latter established itself a long-running favorite, Rapp developed and presented John and Blanche Bickerson, first as a short sketch on \"The Old Gold Show\" and \"The Chase and Sanborn Hour\" (the show that made stars of Edgar Bergen and his dummy, Charlie McCarthy), and then as a 15-minute situational sketch as part of \"Drene Time\". This was a variety show starring Don Ameche and singer-actress Frances Langford as co-hosts, airing on NBC and sponsored by Drene Shampoo. Announcing the show—and later familiar to television viewers as \"The Millionaire\"s presenter and executive secretary, Michael Anthony—was Marvin Miller.\n\n\"Drene Time\" typically opened with Langford singing a big band-style arrangement before Ameche and Langford would slip into routine comedy, often aided by co-star Danny Thomas, in routines that often expressed Ameche's frustration that Thomas was more interested in modern technology and discoveries than in women. After another musical number and a commercial spot for Drene Shampoo, Miller would announce Ameche and Langford as the Bickersons, \"in 'The Honeymoon's Over', for the final 15 minutes of the show.\n\nThe typical Miller introduction would set the scene:\n\nThe Bickersons... have retired. Three o'clock in the morning finds Mrs. Bickerson wide awake and anxious, as poor husband John, victim of contagious insomnia, or Schmoe's Disease, broadcasts the telltale signs of the dreaded affliction. Listen...\n\nThe listener heard a chorus of low-roaring snoring, punctuated occasionally with something that sounded like laughing mixed with crying. Blanche would awaken John, even at three in the morning, and the feuding would continue with their trademark arguments about John's jobs, Blanche's domestic abilities, Blanche's continual wasteful spending of his money; John's alleged eye for neighbor Gloria Gooseby, Blanche's shiftless brother Amos (played by Thomas), her other family members (notably her sister, Clara) or John's taste for bourbon. \n\nSometimes, they would go off on random rants about various scenarios. Blanche usually moaning about not having children, and, after unloading on him about how miserable life would be for a child in that house, would accuse John of not feeding the baby (after calling him an unsympathetic unfeeling wretch), or John ranting about Blanche marrying someone else (usually their tightwad physician, Dr. Hersey) and him living off of his money, usually after John was taunted into making out a will. \n\nDuring their spats, Blanche would often try to force John to do something that normally wouldn't be done at such an early morning hour, such as the aforementioned will; going to Dr. Hersey's office to cure his snoring; or getting re-married. She usually taunted him into these actions, by saying, \"You'll say it, but you won't do it. Do it now!\" \n\nIn fairness, John once turned the tables on Blanche by trying to provoke her (using the \"you'll say it, but you won't do it!\" spiel) into buying him a race-horse after she took his money and squandered it on a bookie. \n\nRounding out the cast was future children's television favorite Pinky Lee in occasional supporting roles.\n\nAs \"New York Herald Tribune\" critic John Crosby described them (in the May 25, 1948 column which gave the couple their nickname, \"The Bickering [Battling? See Talk] Bickersons\"):\n\nBlanche... is one of the monstrous shrews of all time. She makes her husband... take two jobs, a total of 16 working hours, in order to bring in more money which she squanders on minks and the stock market. Meanwhile, he can't afford a new pair of shoes and goes around with his feet painted black. In the few hours he has to sleep, she heckles him all night with the accusation that he doesn't love her. Her aim appears to be to drive her husband crazy and she succeeds very nicely. The harassed John's only weapon is insult, at which he's pretty good.\n\nAs transcribed by John Crosby, this was a typical Bickersons exchange:\n\n<poem>B: You used to be so considerate. Since you got married to me you haven't got any sympathy at all.\nJ: I have, too. I've got everybody's sympathy.\nB: Believe me, there's better fish in the ocean than the one I caught.\nJ: There's better bait, too.\nB: I don't see how you can go to bed without kissing me good night.\nJ: I can do it.\nB: You'd better say you're sorry for that, John.\nJ: Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\nB: You are not.\nJ: I am too. I'm the sorriest man that was ever born.\nB: Is there any milk for breakfast?\nJ: No.\nB: Then you'll have to eat out.\nJ: I don't care, I've been doing it all week.\nB: What for? I left you enough food for six days. I cooked a whole bathtub full of rice. What happened to it?\nJ: I took a bath in it.\nB: Why didn't you eat it?\nJ: I've told you a million times I can't stand the sight of rice.\nB: Why not?\nJ: Because it's connected to the saddest mistake of my life.\nB: You stopped loving me the day we were married.\nJ: That wasn't the day at all.</poem>\n\nThough they spent their allotted time together at each other's throats, assuming always that the shrewish Blanche could awaken John from his snoring, there were moments when the couple showed an uncommon tenderness to each other—particularly in a Christmas skit. (It should have been hinted at the outset by Marvin Miller's atypical introduction: \"The Bickersons—have \"not\" retired.\") After arguing over whether John had sent Blanche a Christmas card (he had—it was buried in a stack of newspapers), they exchanged their gifts to each other... with a twist. Tight in the pocketbook this Christmas season, Blanche swapped a fur coat to buy her bourbon-loving husband a portable bar; John—bourbon lover though he is—swapped his stock to buy Blanche a matching fur muffler, before confessing that for all that they're each other's biggest pain in the rump, there really is a love between them.\n\nJackie Gleason probably knew that Christmas exchange—drawing as did the \"Bickersons\" episode on O. Henry's \"The Gift of the Magi\", a \"classic 39\" Christmas episode of \"The Honeymooners\" involved blustery bus driver Ralph hocking his brand-new bowling ball in a mad dash to get Alice a last-minute Christmas gift... only to learn the hard way that Alice bought him a stylish new bowling ball bag.\n\n\"The Bickersons\" had at least three television runs. The first was as a segment on \"Star Time\", which ran on Dumont for a half-season, from September 1950 to February 1951. A stand-alone \"Bickersons\" series ran on CBS for a short time in summer 1951. In both versions, Lew Parker (later familiar as \"That Girl\"s harried, slightly overbearing father Lew Marie) took the role of John Bickerson, as he also had done on radio a season earlier. The televised version did not work as well as the original skits. Langford did not appear to have the seamless anti-chemistry with Parker as she did with Ameche, and the show's persistent setting (always in the same bedroom) made the show less than ideal for the visual medium. Premiering as a summer season replacement, the CBS version of \"The Bickersons\" lasted only 13 episodes.\n\nAmeche and Langford later co-hosted a variety series, \"The Frances Langford–Don Ameche Show\", in 1951–1952, and featured among the few regular performers a very young Jack Lemmon, as a newlywed in a sketch series known as \"The Couple Next Door\". When Langford hosted a variety special in 1960, Ameche appeared along with The Three Stooges (Moe Howard, Larry Fine, and Joe DeRita at the time), Bob Cummings and Johnny Mathis.\n\nBut neither did the twosome abandon the characters that made them famous as a comedy team in the first place: Columbia Records eventually released long-playing albums—\"The Bickersons\", \"The Bickersons Fight Back\", and \"The Bickersons Rematch\"—that featured newly recorded performances of Rapp's adapted radio scripts by Ameche and Langford as John and Blanche. 'Rematch' was the two LPs reissued in a gatefold jacket as a two record set.\n\nA beautiful woman with a honey voice who used sheer talent to turn herself into the venomous Blanche Bickerson, Frances Langford enjoyed a fine career as a singer and actress in film (including a memorable cameo in the otherwise stylised \"The Glenn Miller Story\") and television, as well as radio; she died July 11, 2005. Don Ameche, whose name sometimes became synonymous (and a kind of running gag) with the telephone (thanks to his film portrayal of Alexander Graham Bell), became a familiar television face as well as a well-respected film actor, enjoying a late-life popular revival through his roles in the 1983 film \"Trading Places\" and the 1985 film \"Cocoon\". He died in 1993.\n\nWith the Rapp family approval, an adapted version of \"The Bickersons\" was written for a comedy puppet show, \"Breakfast with the Bickersons\", premiering at the 2007 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The show was adapted and directed by British comedian Jeremy Engler.\n\n\"Satsuma & Pumpkin\" starred Bob Monkhouse OBE, and was also his very last work before he died. Monkhouse was a big fan of \"The Bickersons\" and \"The Baby Snooks Show\".\n\nIn the movie \"MASH\", when Radar O'Reilly bugs Margaret Houlihan's tent as she and Frank Burns have a sexual encounter, Father Mulcahy (who has walked into the room while the others are listening) is told that the conversation (and noises) being listened to are a radio program. He asks if it is an episode of \"The Bickersons\"...until he realizes otherwise, and hastily leaves.\n\nIn the Season 1 finale of \"NewsRadio\", Dave and Lisa are called \"the magnificent Bickersons\" by Bill (at once a reference to the radio show and a play on the title of Orson Welles' 1942 film \"The Magnificent Ambersons\"). Ameche and Welles shared the same hometown of Kenosha, Wisconsin, and at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the night of October 30, 1938, Welles made his legendary \"\"War of the Worlds\" radio broadcast on the CBS network while Ameche hosted \"The Chase and Sanborn Hour\" on the Red Network of NBC.\n\nThe Bickersons can be heard in the video game \"L.A. Noire\", playing on the radio during driving sequences.\n\nThe Bickersons inspired \"The Honeymooners\" and other television shows about couples.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1933745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933745", "title": "Congregation (Roman Curia)", "text": "Congregation (Roman Curia)\n\nIn the Roman Curia, a congregation () is a type of department of the Curia. They are second highest-ranking departments, ranking below the two Secretariats, and above the pontifical councils, pontifical commissions, tribunals and offices.\n\nOriginally, congregations were selected groups of cardinals drawn from the College of Cardinals, commissioned to take care of some field of activity that concerned the Holy See. Today, as a result of a decision of the Second Vatican Council, members include diocesan bishops from diverse parts of the world who are not cardinals. Each congregation also has a permanent staff.\n\nEach congregation is led by a Prefect, who is usually a cardinal. Until recently, a non-cardinal appointed to head a congregation was styled pro-prefect until made a cardinal. This practice has been abandoned.\n\nCertain curial departments have been organized by the Holy See at various times to assist it in the transaction of those affairs which canonical discipline and the individual interests of the faithful bring to Rome. Of these the most important traditionally were the Roman Congregations, as is evident from the mere consideration of the dignity of their membership, comprising cardinals who assist the pope in the administration of the affairs of the Church, though Cardinals have not always participated in the administration of ecclesiastical affairs in the same way. Under the current law, the dicasteries are juridically equal, but congregations generally have more direct jurisdiction than other dicasteries.\n\nEcclesiastical business used to be handled by the pontifical chancery. However, the ever-growing number of business items and the ever-increasing complexity of the issues necessitated the creation of separate, specialised administrative-legislative bodies (the administrative and legislative functions of ecclesiastical government are not as sharply separated in the Catholic Church as in a secular government with the separation of powers).\n\nThe Roman Congregations originated in the necessity, felt from the beginning, of studying the questions submitted for pontifical decision, in order to sift the legal questions arising and to establish matters of fact duly. This work, at first entrusted to the papal chaplains, was afterwards divided between the penitentiarii and the auditores, according as questions of the internal or the external forum (i.e., jurisdiction) were to be considered. Thereafter, cardinals in greater or less number were associated with them. Often, however, they were not merely entrusted with the preparation of the case, but were given authority to decide it. As, on the other hand, the increased numbers of cases to be passed upon occupied a great number of persons, while the proper administration of justice required that those persons should be of the most experienced, it appeared to be advisable, if not necessary, to divide this business into various and distinct groups. This division would evidently facilitate the selection of wise and experienced men in all branches of ecclesiastical affairs. Hence also a natural division into executive cases, assigned to the offices (\"officia\"), judicial cases, reserved to the tribunals, and administrative cases, committed to the Roman Congregations.\n\nPope Sixtus V was the first to distribute this administrative business among different congregations of cardinals; and in his Apostolic Constitution \"Immensa Aeterni Dei\" (22 January 1588) he generalized the idea, already conceived and partly reduced to practice by some of his predecessors, of committing one or another case or a group of cases to the examination, or to the decision, of several cardinals. By a judicious division of administrative matters, he established that permanent organization of these departments of the Curia, which since then have rendered such great services to the Church. The congregations at first established by Sixtus V were officially designated as\n\n\nWhile the chief end of the Congregations of Cardinals was to assist the sovereign pontiff in the administration of the affairs of the Church, some of these congregations were created to assist in the administration of the temporal States of the Holy See. The number of these varied according to circumstances and the requirements of the moment; in the time of Cardinal De Luca there were about nineteen of them, as he tells in his \"Relatio Romanæ Curiæ forensis\", without counting other congregations of a lower order, consisting of prelates, as were, for example, the \"Congregatio baronum et montium\" and the \"Congregatio computorum\".\n\nOther congregations were added by different popes, until a complete organization was established by Pope Pius X in his Constitution \"Sapienti Consilio\" of 29 June 1908, according to which there were thirteen congregations, counting that of the Propaganda as only one; however, the last-named congregation is divided into two parts: Congregation of the Propaganda for Affairs of the Latin Rite, and Congregation of the Propaganda for Affairs of the Oriental Rites, it may well be considered as two congregations, so that the total number of the congregations is fourteen. Sixtus V granted ordinary jurisdiction to each of the congregations which he instituted within the limits of the cases assigned to it, reserving to himself and to his successors the presidency of some of the more important congregations, such as the Congregation of the Holy Inquisition and that of the Signature of Grace. As time went on, the congregations of cardinals, which at first dealt exclusively with administrative matters, came to pass upon the legal points of the cases submitted to them, until the congregations overshadowed the ecclesiastical tribunals and even the Roman Rota, in fact almost taking their places. In time the transaction of business was impeded by the accumulation of jurisdictions, different congregations exercising jurisdiction rendering decisions and enacting laws in the same matters; Pius X resolved to define the competency of each congregation more precisely and to provide otherwise for the better exercise of its functions.\n\nOn 29 June 1908, with the constitution Sapienti Consilio, Pope Pius X reduced the number of the congregations to 11. They were:\n\nAll decisions of the sacred congregations require pontifical approval, unless special powers have been given previously by the pope. The officials of the congregations are divided into two classes: minor officers, who are to be chosen by competitive examination and named by a letter of the Cardinal-prefect, and major officers, freely selected by the pope, and named by a note of the Cardinal Secretary of State. There is to be henceforth no cumulation of offices in the hands of one individual, not only to satisfy the requirements of distributive justice, but also because the tenure of several offices by the same person often results in detriment to the service. Wherefore, it is forbidden for an officer of one of the congregations to serve in any way as an agent, or as a procurator or advocate, in his own department or in any other ecclesiastical tribunal.\n\nThe competency of the 'congresso' in each congregation is determined. The congresso consists of the major officers under the presidency of the cardinal who presides over the congregation. It deals with the matters of less importance among those that are before the congregation, while those of greater moment must be referred to the full congregations of cardinals. It is also the business of the congresso to prepare for their discussion those matters that are to be considered by the full congregation. On the other hand, the congresso is charged with the execution of the orders of the full congregation that have received the approval of the pope. As examples of matters of greater importance which must be considered by the full congregation, the special rules (\"normæ peculiares\") mention the solution of doubts or of questions that may arise in regard to the interpretation of ecclesiastical laws, the examination of important administrative controversies and kindred matters. The normæ peculiares and the \"normæ communes\", together with the Constitution \"Sapienti Consilio\", constituted the entire code of Pius' organization of the Roman ecclesiastical departments.\n\nFollowing the Second Vatican Council, Pope Paul VI implemented many of the changes called for in the Curia with his Constitution \"Regimini Ecclesiae Universae\" of 15 August 1967. One of the main changes brought about by Paul VI was the admission of diocesan bishops and archbishops as members of the Congregations, which has previously been restricted to cardinals.\nThe most recent reorganization of the Roman Congregations came with Pope John Paul II's Constitution \"Pastor Bonus\", issued June 28, 1988. This constitution more closely aligned the structure of the Curia with the norms established by the 1983 Code of Canon Law and the early drafts of what became the 1990 \"Code of Canons for the Eastern Churches\". \"Pastor Bonus\" also continued Paul's expansion of the membership of congregations, allowing priests, deacons, the religious and the laity to be members of certain congregations and establishing consultors, experts appointed to the dicasteries of the Roman Curia to provide opinions, either singly or collectively, for particular issues when required.\n\nSr. Luzia Premoli, superior general of the Combonian Missionary Sisters, was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples in 2014, thus becoming the first woman to be appointed a member of a Vatican congregation.\n\nSince 1988, there have been nine Congregations:\n\n\n"}

He is best known for the Cosmere universe, in which most of his fantasy novels (most notably the \"Mistborn\" series and \"The Stormlight Archive\") are set. He is also known for finishing Robert Jordan's high fantasy series \"The Wheel of Time\". \n\nHe created Sanderson's Laws of Magic and popularized the terms hard magic and soft magic systems. In 2008 Sanderson started a podcast with author Dan Wells and cartoonist Howard Tayler called \"Writing Excuses\", involving topics about creating genre writing and webcomics.\n\nIn 2016, the American media company DMG Entertainment licensed the movie rights to Sanderson's entire Cosmere universe.\n\nBrandon Sanderson was born on December 19, 1975, in Lincoln, Nebraska. He has a younger brother, Jordan, and two younger sisters, Jane and Lauren. He became a passionate reader of high fantasy novels while a teenager, and he made several early attempts at writing his own stories. After graduating from high school in 1994, he matriculated at Brigham Young University (BYU) as a biochemistry major. He took a two-year leave of absence from 1995 to 1997 to serve as a volunteer missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and was assigned to serve in South Korea.\n\nAfter completing his missionary service, Sanderson returned to BYU and changed his major to English literature. While an undergraduate, Sanderson took a job as a night desk clerk at a local hotel in Provo, Utah, as it allowed him to write while working. One of Sanderson's roommates at BYU was Ken Jennings, who nearly ten years later became famous during his 74-game win streak on the American game show \"Jeopardy!\". Sanderson graduated with a B.A. in English in 2000, then continued on as a graduate student at BYU, receiving an M.A. in English with an emphasis in creative writing in 2004. While at BYU, Sanderson was on the staff of \"Leading Edge\", a semi-professional speculative fiction magazine published by the university, and served as its editor-in-chief for one year.\n\nIn 2006, Sanderson married Emily Bushman, a fellow English major and teacher, who later became his business manager. They have three sons and reside in American Fork, Utah.\n\nSanderson wrote consistently throughout his undergraduate and graduate studies, and by 2003 he had written twelve novels, though no publisher had accepted any of them for publication. While in the middle of a graduate program at BYU, Tor Books editor Moshe Feder contacted him to say that he wanted to acquire one of his books. Sanderson had submitted the manuscript of his sixth novel, \"Elantris\", a year and a half earlier. \"Elantris\" was published by Tor Books on April 21, 2005, to generally positive reviews. This was followed in 2006 by \"\", the first book in his \"Mistborn\" fantasy trilogy, in which \"allomancers\"—people with the ability to 'burn' metals and alloys after ingesting them—gain enhanced senses and control over powerful supernatural forces.\n\nHe published the second book of the \"Mistborn\" series \"\" in 2007. Later that year, Sanderson published the children's novel \"Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians\", about a boy named Alcatraz with a talent for breaking things. Alcatraz confronts a group of evil librarians who are bent on taking over the world. The first of his \"laws of magic\" were first published in 2007, with the second and third published in 2012 and 2013 (respectively). In 2008, the third and final book in the Mistborn trilogy was published, titled \"\", as well as the second book in the Alcatraz series, titled \"Alcatraz Versus the Scrivener's Bones\". That same year, he started the podcast \"Writing Excuses\" with Howard Tayler and Dan Wells. Brandon Sanderson is in the process of writing the sixth book of the Alcatraz series, called Bastille Versus The World Spire.\n\nIn 2009, Tor Books published \"Warbreaker\", which originally appeared serially on Sanderson's website while he was writing the novel from 2006 to 2009. In the same year, the third \"Alcatraz\" book was published, titled \"Alcatraz Versus the Knights of Crystallia\".\n\nSanderson became well known in late 2007 after he was selected by the author Robert Jordan's widow and editor, Harriet McDougal, to complete the final books in Jordan's epic fantasy series \"The Wheel of Time\". McDougal asked him to finish the series after being deeply impressed by his first \"Mistborn\" novel. Tor Books made the announcement on December 7, 2007. After reviewing what was necessary to complete the series, Sanderson and Tor announced on March 30, 2009, that a final three books would be published instead of just one. The first of these, \"The Gathering Storm\", was published on October 27, 2009, and reached the number-one spot on the \"New York Times\" bestseller list for hardcover fiction.\n\nIn 2010, Sanderson published \"The Way of Kings,\" the first of a planned ten-book series called \"The Stormlight Archive\". It achieved the number seven slot on the \"New York Times\" hardcover fiction bestseller list. \"Towers of Midnight\", the second-to-last \"Wheel of Time\" book, was published just over a year after \"The Gathering Storm\" on November 2, 2010, debuting at number one on the bestseller list. The fourth Alcatraz novel, \"Alcatraz Versus the Shattered Lens\", was published a month later on December 1.\n\nIn October 2011, he finished a novella e-book, \"\", based on the action role-playing, iOS video game \"Infinity Blade\", developed by Chair Entertainment and Epic Games. In November 2011, he published a sequel to the \"Mistborn\" trilogy, \"\". It was originally planned as a standalone novel set about 300 years after the original trilogy, but it was later expanded into a four-book series. It debuted at number seven on the \"New York Times\" bestseller list.\n\nOn August 31, 2012, Sanderson published a science fiction novella entitled \"Legion,\" followed by another short work titled \"The Emperor's Soul\". A few months later, on January 8, 2013, \"A Memory of Light\" was published, the final book in \"The Wheel of Time\" series. In 2013, Sanderson published two new young adult series. These series included \"The Rithmatist\" and the first of \"The Reckoners.\" series titled \"Steelheart\" In March 2014, \"Words of Radiance\", the second book in \"The Stormlight Archive\", was published. \n\nLater that year, Sanderson also published the second novella in the \"Legion\" series, \"Legion: Skin Deep\". In January 2015, the second book of \"The Reckoners\", titled \"Firefight\", was published. Nine months later, Sanderson published \"\" as a direct sequel to \"The Alloy of Law\". On November 16, 2015, Sanderson's agency (JABberwocky Literary Agency) announced that Sanderson officially sold over 7 million copies worldwide.\n\nOn January 26, 2016, \"\" was published as the sequel to \"Shadows of Self\". On February 16, 2016, the third and final book of the Reckoners trilogy, titled Calamity, was published. In June 2016, Sanderson's first graphic novel \"White Sand\"—written with Rik Hoskin—was released. The series is planned as a trilogy. The graphic novels are based on an original manuscript by Sanderson. On September 6, 2016, the fifth \"Alcatraz\" book was published, called \"Alcatraz Versus the Dark Talent\".\n\nIn October 2016, media company DMG Entertainment acquired the film and licensing rights to Sanderson's entire Cosmere universe. As part of the deal, DMG committed to spending at least $270 million, which they estimate will cover half of the money needed to produce the first three film adaptations of Sanderson's books, and is fast-tracking the development of a script for a film adaptation of Sanderson's book \"The Way of Kings\". Sanderson will receive a minimum guarantee on each film, plus a \"backend\" giving him a percentage of each film's profits, which will allow him to earn several million dollars from the films. On November 22, 2016, an anthology of Cosmere short stories and novellas was published, titled \"\". The third book in \"The Stormlight Archive Oathbringer\" was published on November 14, 2017.\n\nThe first book of the \"Defiant\" series, \"Skyward\", was published on November 6, 2018. The second book in the series, \"Starsight\", was released on November 26, 2019.\n\nSanderson is adjunct faculty at Brigham Young University, teaching a creative writing course once per year. Sanderson also participates in the weekly podcast \"Writing Excuses\" with authors Dan Wells, Mary Robinette Kowal, and web cartoonist Howard Tayler.\n\nThe Cosmere is the name of the series and universe in which \"Elantris\", \"Mistborn\", \"Warbreaker\", \"The Stormlight Archive\", \"White Sand\", and stories contained in \"\" are all set. This idea came from Sanderson's desire to create an epic-length series without requiring readers to buy a ridiculous number of books. Because of that, he hides connections to his other works within each book, creating this \"hidden epic\". He has estimated that the Cosmere sequence could conclude with at least 40 books.\n\nThe story of the Cosmere is about a mysterious being called Adonalsium, who existed on a world known as Yolen. Adonalsium was killed by a group of sixteen conspirators, causing its power to shatter into sixteen different Shards, each of which bears immense power. The sixteen people then took these Shards and traveled to new worlds, populating them with different systems of magic. In one case, the Shards \"Ruin\" and \"Preservation\" worked together to actually create a planet and its people (Scadrial, as featured in \"Mistborn\").\n\nEach Shard has an Intent, such as \"Ambition\" or \"Honor\", and a Vessel's personality is changed over time to bring them more in-line with their Intent. \"Odium\" has killedor Splinteredseveral shards. On Sel, he splintered \"Devotion\" and \"Dominion\", accidentally creating the Dor, from which Seons and Skaze have emerged. On Roshar, \"Odium\" splintered \"Honor\", and brought about the Everstorm and the True Desolation. He has also Splintered \"Ambition\", in the Threnody system. A man named Hoid is seen or mentioned in most Cosmere books. He travels the so-called Shardworlds, using the people of those worlds to further an unknown agenda.\n\nIn October 2016, the movie rights to the entire Cosmere universe were licensed by DMG Entertainment.\n\nSanderson has created multiple series with a wide variety of characters and stories. He writes mostly epic fantasy, but many of his series have science fiction elements in them. He has also written several science fiction short works, and he wrote the last three volumes of Robert Jordan's \"The Wheel of Time\" series. \n\nSanderson writes many of his works in an overarching universe known as the \"Cosmere\" with series tending to be on different planets within that universe. The works, especially the magic systems within them, are often subtly connected, and some characters appear across the various series. \n\nThe first released book in the Cosmere was his first novel, \"Elantris\", set on the world of Sel. The short story, \"The Hope of Elantris\", was set during the events of the novel. The novella, \"The Emperor's Soul\", is set in a different location on Sel from \"Elantris\". This novella won the 2013 Hugo Award for best novella.\n\nThe \"Mistborn\" series, which consists of six novels and three short works , is set in the Scadrial system. The first three novels, \"\", \"\", and \"\", follow the adventures of Vin and company as they defeat the Lord Ruler and deal with the aftermath of that choice. \n\n\"\"—set on Scadrial 300 years after the original \"Mistborn\" trilogy—was originally slated to be a standalone novel, but Sanderson eventually expanded the story into four books, creating the \"Wax and Wayne\" series. The second book, \"\", was released in 2015, and the third, \"\", in 2016. \"The Lost Metal\", the final book in the \"Wax and Wayne\" series, is projected for 2020 or 2021.\n\nTwo other novel series are planned, but Sanderson has not yet announced projected release dates for them.\n\nSeveral shorter works set on Scadrial have been released as well.\n\nThe works in \"The Stormlight Archive\" are set on the world of Roshar. , three volumes of a projected ten have been released. \"The Way of Kings\" establishes the world of Roshar, introducing several important characters: Kaladin, Shallan, Szeth, and Dalinar. \"Words of Radiance\" continues the story, expanding on the Voidbringers and the Knights Radiant. The third volume, \"Oathbringer\", was released in 2017. The 4th entry, tentatively titled \"The Rhythm of War\", is set to be released on November 17th, 2020. \n\nAs with the \"Mistborn\" series, several short works set on Roshar have been released. \n\nA three-volume \"White Sand\" series was released as a series of graphic novels. Kenton , a young Sand Master from the Dayside of Taldain, must find out why most of the Sand Masters were killed while also avoiding assassins and trying to work with a mysterious woman from the Night side of the planet. The first volume won a 2018 Dragon Award for best graphic novel.\n\nSet on Nalthis, \"Warbreaker\" tells the story of Vivenna and Siri, two sisters caught up in political machinations that could destroy them and everything they hold dear. Another book set on Nalthis, tentatively titled \"Nightblood\", has been announced, but no specific release date has been given.\n\n\"Sixth of the Dusk\"—a novellette set on the world in the Drominad system—and \"Shadows For Silence in the Forests of Hell\"—a novella set in the Threnody system—contain more horror elements than the other Cosmere works. A collection of Cosmere short works, \"\", was released in November 2016.\n\nThe \"Alcatraz\" series follows the adventures of Alcatraz Smedry as he matches wits with evil librarians bent on controlling the world. The first four volumes, \"Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians\", \"Alcatraz Versus the Scrivener's Bones\", \"Alcatraz Versus the Knights of Crystallia\", and \"Alcatraz Versus the Shattered Lens\", were originally published by Scholastic Press.

The fifth volume, \"The Dark Talent\", was released in 2016. A sixth volume has been announced for an unknown future date.\n\nIn \"The Reckoners\" series, a strange orbiting entity appeared in the sky above Earth, emitting a radiation that gave some superhuman abilities while also amplifying their selfishness. This caused these \"Epics\" to usurp governments worldwide and positions of varying power, enslaving and murdering normal humans. The main character, David, works with a small group called the Reckoners to find the weaknesses of Epics and assassinate them in order to free the world from the Epics. There are three novels (\"Steelheart\", \"Firefight\", and \"Calamity\") and one novella (\"Mitosis\") in the series.\n\nThe \"Legion\" novella series tells the story of Stephen Leeds, a man gifted with multiple, distinct personalities (or \"aspects\") that help him solve various mysteries and puzzles. The aspects often manifest when he requires specific knowledge about something. Most of them are aware of the other personalities, and can even interact with each other. The novellas include \"Legion\", \"Legion: Skin Deep\", and \"Legion: Lies of the Beholder\".\n\nA novelette, \"Defending Elysium\" (2008), was the first work released in this series. The first novel, \"Skyward\", was released in 2018. It begins the story of Spensa, a young girl wishing to restore honor to her father's name after he apparently abandoned his flight while fighting the alien Krell. She has to deal with an academy faculty that doesn't like her and the seemingly-impossible task of finding a way to defeat the ever-present Krell. The second book, \"Starsight\", was released in 2019. The third and fourth books in the series are expected to be released in 2021 and 2022, respectively.\n\nSanderson has been nominated for and also won multiple awards for his various works.

In heraldic language, the arms are described as: \"Barry of ten Argent and Azure, a Lion rampant queue forchée Gules crowned, armed and langued Or.\"\n\nThere are greater, middle and lesser versions of the coat of arms of Luxembourg. The greater coat of arms has two reguardant and crowned lions as supporters, the Dynastic Order (the Order of the Oak Crown) and all surrounded by ermine mantling crowned with a heraldic royal crown (the crown used by the Grand Duke). The middle coat of arms has the supporters, the order and the crown. The lesser coat of arms has the crown and the escutcheon without external ornaments.\n\nThe Grand Duke has a personal coat of arms, the current arms were adopted in 2001:\n\nQuarterly: 1 and 4 Luxembourg, 2 and 3 Nassau (Blazon: \"Azure billetty Or, a lion or armed and langued Gules\"). The lesser variant of the arms of the monarch has no external ornaments. The middle variant has the supporters, the order and the crown.\n\nThe greater variant has a dynastic inescutcheon with the arms of the House of Bourbon-Parma (Blazon: \"Azure bordure Gules charged with eight escallops Argent, three fleurs-de-lys Or\"). The supporters are holding a lance Or, flying the flag of Luxembourg, all surrounded by ermine mantling with the crown.\n\nThe coat of arms adopted by Grand Duke Adolphe in 1898:\n\nThese arms were adopted in 1898 by Grand Duke Adolphe and used by him and his successors up until Grand Duke Jean. Upon acceding to the throne in 1964, Grand Duke Jean used the lesser and medium arms as adopted in 1898. The greater arms featuring the former territorial claims attached to the duchy of Nassau that was annexed by Prussia in 1866 were, however, unreflective of political reality of the time and were not used extensively: They were only used on the Great Seal of Grand Duke Jean.\n\nPrior to acceding the throne, Grand Duke Jean made use of the following arms:\n\nIn 1939, a coat of arms for Prince Jean was created during the centenary celebrations of the independence of Luxembourg and to mark his reaching the age of majority. In 1953, another arms were created on the occasion of Jean's marriage to Princess Joséphine-Charlotte of Belgium.\n\nThe original coat of arms from 1890–1898:\nThe current greater and lesser coats of arms for the Hereditary Grand Duke are currently prescribed by grand-ducal decree of 31 October 2012 and are similar to that of the Grand Duke's with the addition of a gold label on the shield for differencing. In the greater arms, the supporters also do not carry flags.\n\nHenry V was the first Count of Luxembourg to adopt a primitive form of these arms. His father, Waleran III, Duke of Limburg, bore the arms, \"argent a lion rampant queue fourché gules armed, langued and crowned or\" (white field bearing a red double tailed lion with yellow claws, teeth, tongue and crown). Henry V replaced the white field by a series of white and blue stripes (burely of 10 argent and azure) to differentiate from his half-brother Henry IV, Duke of Limburg.\n\nIt is yet uncertain where the origins of this burely of 10 argent and azure are. Jean-Claude Loutsch, Luxembourg's most prominent heraldist, authored the theory that the original Luxembourg dynasties may have born a striped banner (colours unknown). Two dynasties closely related to the first Houses of Luxembourg also adopted striped coats of arms during this period. Both the Counts of Loon and Counts of Grandpré bore the arms burely of 10 or and gules (yellow and red alternating stripes). In such a case, the choice of colour of the stripes would have been determined to match the white field and red lion of Limburg.\n\nIn 1282, after the death of Waleran IV of Limburg, Henry VI, count of Luxembourg changed his arms by doubling the lion's tail and passing it in saltire as a claim on the duchy of Limburg. After Henry VI's death in 1288 at the Battle of Worringen, Henry VII readopted his grandfather Henry V's arms, which remained in use until the extinction of the House of Luxembourg.\n\nThe Luxembourg Coat of Arms bears a striking similarity to both the arms of Lusignan and of Stratford. The relationship is unknown, if indeed any exists at all although the link between the Lusignan and Luxembourg coat-of-arms is provided in 'Le Roman de Mélusine' by Couldrette whereby a descendant of the legendary founder and faerie queen of Lusignan adopts the burely of 10 argent and azure, adding the lion rampant due to his similarly-shaped birthmark. Historians have generated various theories as to the connection between the houses and the arms, none conclusive.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1933777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933777", "title": "Sniper (group)", "text": "Sniper (group)\n\nSniper is a French hip hop band formed in 1997 in the Val-d'Oise department. It currently consists of Tunisiano (Bachir Baccour), Aketo (Ryad Selmi) and Blacko. Afrikaf (Karl Appela) was also a member from the group's formation to 2004; Blacko had also left the band in 2007, but returned in 2016.\n\nThe members of Sniper first met at the 1997 Francofolies festival at La Rochelle. There, DJ Boudj and the three rappers Aketo, Tunisiano and Blacko met and decided to form the group, originally called Personnalité suspecte (Suspicious Character). This name was abbreviated to Persni and finally ended up as Sniper, an example of the French slang form, known as \"verlan\".\n\nThe three members form a complementary group, as Aketo and El Tunisiano have developed more of a rap style and Blacko prefers an approach closer to reggae; meanwhile DJ Boudj takes care of the scratching. They began by making appearances on various mixes and compilations, such as \"The Power of Unity\", \"Première classe\" (First Class) and \"B.O.S.S.\".\n\nSniper's career officially began in January 2001, with the release of their first album, \"Du rire aux larmes\" (From laughter to tears) on the Desh Music label. The album title indicates the philosophy of the group: a mixture of humor (of a verbal tournament between Aketo and Tunisiano) and more serious texts (\"Pris Pour Cible\"), run in varied energetic tempos. Song topics can be found in everyday life: racism, exits, girls. They do not forsake the rap form but avoid contributing to the stereotype of rap music as ghetto music. The album went double gold with more than 250,000 albums sold.\n\nIn spring 2003, the group produced a more refined album, \"Gravé dans la roche\" (Carved in stone). This album covers many subjects like the Israeli–Palestinian conflict with \"Jeteur de pierres\" (Stone thrower), global warming on \"Visions chaotiques\" (Chaotic visions) or the idleness of certain young people in Trop vite\" (Too fast). Lighter titles are not in \"Processus 2003\" and \"Recette maison\" (House recipe). The best known singles are \"Sans (re)pères\" (Without point/father) and \"Gravé dans la roche\" (Engraved in stone). \"Panam All Starz\" is a piece which gathers various artists of the Paris area, each one representing a department: Haroun (75th department), Mano Kid Mesa (77th), L'Skadrille (78th), Sinik and Diam's (91st), Salif and Zoxea (92nd), Tandem (93rd), 113 (94th) and Sniper (95th)\n\nAs the group's popularity grew, so did their fan base. This popularity showed in the second album which sold more than 400,000 copies, nearly double the sales of the previous album. This success was notably due to the fact that they were less crude and refined their lyrics in order to produce a quality album.\n\nOn 2 May 2006, Sniper returned to the French rap scene. A few weeks after its release, their album was placed a number 1 in sales. However, the group changed. DJ Boudj left Sniper. The reasons were not detailed but it would be considered to be an argument, ”as in any family\", explained one of the remaining members of the group. At that time, the group marked a clear evolution reaching a certain maturity whose first steps had already been perceptible in their second album \"Gravé dans la roche\".\n\nWith the album \"Trait pour trait\", Sniper reached total sales of more than 1 million copies for all three albums and thus confirmed themselves as one of the best rap bands in France.\n\nIn three albums, Sniper convinced rap fans in France that they were interested in many quite different subjects, such as religion, international conflicts like Iraq–US, Palestine–Israel, or love, respect, resentment, various injustices and inequalities, immigration, the difficulties of life in the suburbs, the real/fake dream of the Western world and racism, etc.\n\nThe group is subject to heteroclite influences: old style rap, in particular under the influence of Aketo, as well as drawing from texts in Arabic, sung by Tunisiano, but also Blacko's reggae work.\n\nThe group confirmed that a fourth album would appear once they finished their respective solo albums. However, Blacko announced on 20 February 2008 that he had separated himself from the group since July 2007.\n\nSniper's fourth album \"À toute épreuve\" was released on 26 September 2011 in digital format and on 3 October 2011 in physical form.\n\nIn March 2016, the band announced that Blacko had rejoined the band. At a concert at La Cigale on May 28, 2016, they announced that they had started working on a new album. In January 2018 they confirmed that the album was nearly completed.\n\nThe group has had several legal battles, notably for their lyrics in songs such as \"La France\" and for a song on the conflict in the Middle East called \"Jeteur de pierres'\" (Stone thrower). The group was acquitted by the court of Rouen of charges based on \"La France\". They were later accused of antisemitism based on their treatment of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict on their second album, which provoked the ire of several Jewish organizations. The Minister of the Interior at the time, Nicolas Sarkozy, called them \"ruffians who dishonor France\".\n\nOthers\n\n"}

The architect of the edifice was Ghavameddin Shirazi, who is responsible for so many of Shah Rukh's great buildings, with the architectural and decorative manpower supplied from Shiraz and Isfahan. \n\nThe mosque underwent some renovations during the Safavid and Qajar eras. It has four \"iwans\" and a courtyard measuring , as well as several \"shabestans\". Various inscriptions found on mosaic tile work inside the mosque and its courtyard mention the names of Safavid shahs such as Shah Abbas, Shah Soltan Hussayn, Shah Soleyman Safavid and describe their devotion to the Shrine and the contributions they made to the mosque. \n\nThe double-layered dome of the mosque was severely damaged in 1911 in bombings by troops of the Russian Empire. In the 1960s, over 5 centuries after its initial construction, the dome of Goharshad mosque was deemed to be in severe structural danger, damages caused by various earthquakes over time, the 1911 Russian bombings, and the attack on the mosque by Reza Shah during the 1935 rebellion required the dome to be rebuilt. Under the imperial orders of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the tiles from the ancient dome were removed in the 1960s and the external shell was dismantled. In order to address the structural dangers, a new external shell was built with an iron frame and cement covering. The dome was then re-tiled, in a similar fashion to the original. While such repairs were necessary, they permanently altered the historic identity of the mosque. \n\nIn the 1960s, the mosque's eastern iwan also received restoration work. It was pulled down to the foundations and rebuilt from concrete in the same aesthetic style as the original. \n\nFollowing the event of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, expansions were planned for the entirety of the Shrine complex, a new courtyard named \"Sahn-e-Qods\" was added on to the back side of Gowharshad mosque, where the historic bazaar once had led up to.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1933797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933797", "title": "Graeme Leung", "text": "Graeme Leung\n\nGraham Everett Leung is a Fijian lawyer and former president of the Fiji Law Society. He was also chairman of the Electoral Commission, and was named as judge advocate of a Court Martial panel to retry 20 soldiers convicted mutiny in relation to the Fiji coup of 2000, but a number of complications left his commissioning in that office outstanding until he was finally approved as judge advocate and commissioned as an army officer with the rank of lieutenant colonel on 4 January 2006.\n\nPrivately, Leung was a senior partner at Howards, a commercial law firm in the Fijian capital, Suva. He retired from private practice in June 2009 following the abrogation of the Fijian Constitution. He chose not to renew his licence to practice law after the military backed regime altered the licensing procedure, requiring lawyers to submit their applications for new licences to practice from the office of Chief Registrar of the High Court. Previously, the Law Society issued legal practitioners with practising certificates.\n\nLeung was an outspoken critic of certain government policies which, he says, undermined the rule of law. In particular, he has opposed the early release of persons convicted and imprisoned for offences related to the Fiji coup of 2000, and the promotion of legislation which he believes undermines respect for the rule of law.\n\nLeung strongly opposed the government's decision, announced on 29 November 2004, to release Vice-President Ratu Jope Seniloli from prison, where he had served little more than three months of a four-year sentence for his role in the Fiji coup of 2000. \"\"It lends the appearance of two sets of rules, or two classes of justice. It lends the appearance that if you're well connected and of a high social standing, you might expect more favour with the authorities. Conversely, if you are a person of lesser social standing, you might expect the full brunt of the law to weigh on you. Now that seems to me to be a travesty,\"\" he said.\n\nAddressing the annual conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in Nadi on 8 September, Leung said that the concept of true democracy was not well understood in Fiji. \"\"Democracy, the rule of law and human rights march hand in hand. These concepts are not well understood by a good portion of the population,\"\" he said. \"\"It is far more than merely participating in free and fair elections for a new government. It is about playing by a set of rules, respecting those rules and accepting the result even when it may not be what one had hoped for.\"\" Many Fijian people feared that could undermine their way of life, essence, and identity, he said. Rather than ridicule these fears, it was necessary to understand and address them, and to develop a new paradigm to illustrate the consonance between Fijian traditions and democratic norms. \"\"The evidence shows a growing albeit reluctant acceptance of the rule of law,\"\" he said. \"\"But time, patience and a genuine commitment not just of the country's leaders towards creating an environment that will allow democracy, human rights and the rule of law to flourish, will be required.\"\"\n\nOn 21 May 2005, Leung joined numerous politicians, human rights organisations, and the military in opposing the government's proposed legislation to establish a Reconciliation and Unity Commission, which would be empowered, subject to presidential approval, to grant compensation to victims of the 2000 coup and amnesty to persons found guilty of involvement in it. Leung said that he and the Law Society supported the bill's purported aims of reconciliation, tolerance, and unity, but were strongly opposed to the amnesty provisions of the legislation, which he said were \"repugnant\" and would empower politicians to overturn judicial decisions. \"\"It's likely to demoralise the judiciary and sap it of the will to continue its work,\"\" he said. It would also encourage future generations to regard coups as something they could take part in with impunity.\n\nIn a letter to Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase on 23 May, Leung said that as reconciliation and forgiveness were matters of the heart, they could not be legislated, and the bill would therefore fail to achieve its stated objectives. \"\"The bill is not the answer to Fiji's problems,\"\" he said. He also expressed concern that the way the bill was written, linking compensation with amnesty, rich perpetrators of the 2000 coup would benefit the most. Citing the Fijian cultural inhibition on frank expression of strong opinions, he said that it would be unwise for the government to interpret the silence of the majority of its citizens as approval of its agenda. \"\"It's the way we are – our people show their respect to their leaders by keeping quiet. It is considered rude to speak your mind,\"\" he said.\n\nIn a parliamentary submission on 16 June, Leung called the bill a recipe for instability, terror and payback, and a retrograde step, which could threaten present and future governments. \"\"It would encourage the belief that if people think they have sufficiently good political reason to topple a government, politicians might consider granting them a pardon,\"\" Leung said. He expressed content that the decisions of the Commission and Amnesty Committee would not be required to state any reasons for their decisions, which would not be subject to appeal. He said it was \"abhorrent and unacceptable\" to create what amounted to retrospective legalisation of a terrorist act.\n\nWhile opposing the legislation, however, Leung cautioned the military to show restraint, saying that Parliament had the constitutional Right to pass laws, whether good or bad, and that it was up to the people to punish politicians for bad laws at election time. \"\"If the law is bad and unpopular, it is for the people through the ballot box, to show their displeasure,\"\" he said on 21 May. \"\"But in a democracy, it is not the business of the military, however well-intentioned, to interfere with the law-making process.\"\"\n\nOn 4 July, the Fiji Times revealed that Leung had been trying for over a week to schedule a meeting with the Prime Minister, without receiving a response. Then on 5 July, Leung called for an urgent meeting with Attorney-General Qoriniasi Bale in an effort to persuade him to rewrite the bill, in response to recent comments by Military Commander Frank Bainimarama calling the bill a form of \"ethnic cleansing.\" Leung said that every right thinking person should be alarmed that the debate had risen to that level.\n\nOn 3 September 2005, Leung fended off a challenge from Lautoka-based lawyer Iqbal Khan to win a second term as president of the Fiji Law Society, amassing 91 percent of the vote. The term was for one year. Khan's campaign had been undermined by allegations that he had been barred from practising law in the Australian state of Queensland for corruption. He chose to retire from the presidency in 2006, and Devanesh Sharma was elected to succeed him on 9 September.\n\nOn 5 October 2005, Leung was named judge advocate of a court martial panel to retry 20 soldiers convicted of mutiny in relation to the Fiji coup of 2000. He was the only civilian member of the 10-member panel. On 19 October, however, he was abruptly dismissed by President Ratu Josefa Iloilo, but was subsequently reinstated on 26 October. The reasons for the dismissal and reinstatement were not fully clarified, but it was understood that the President had wanted to explore the matter thoroughly before ratifying Leung, the choice of the Military, as judge advocate. The trial was subsequently rescheduled, and adjourned, several times.\n\nWhen the military commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, raised questions about why the commissioning process was taking so long, Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola revealed on 21 December that the government objected to what he said were Leung's exorbitant fees. \"\"Even the Chief Justice ... (does) not get that kind of money,\"\" he said of the proposed F$130,000 contract. Commodore Bainimarama disagreed, saying that the same sum had been paid to the previous judge advocate.\n\nOn 4 January 2006, Home Affairs Minister Vosanibola announced that Leung had been approved as judge advocate, and commissioned as an army officer, with the rank of lieutenant colonel. The delay had been caused by the need to gain further information from the military, he claimed, but military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni denied this.\n\nSpeaking to the media on 10 January 2005, clarified that he would not be receiving the F$130,000 remuneration as a lump sum. That was his annual remuneration, he said; the monthly remuneration amounted to one twelfth of that – considerably less than what he would be paid by private clients, whose custom he had to forgo for the sake of the court martial. Leung said he accepted the role of judge advocate after many others had declined it, because he felt strongly about the rule of law and the concept of justice.\n\nHe was a vocal critic of Fiji's most recent coup which took place in December 2006 and embarked on extensive speaking engagements internationally including countries like Kenya, Jamaica, Malaysia and Hong Kong, lamenting the undermining of the rule of law and democratic governance in Fiji. As a result of his stand against military rule, he was temporarily banned from leaving Fiji. The ban was lifted following his mounting of a High Court challenge. Following his departure from private practice in 2009, Leung lectured briefly at the University of the South Pacific in Suva. In December 2009, he undertook a consultancy with the Rome based International Development Law Organization where he worked in Kenya, helping to support the work of that country's Committee of Experts which had been tasked to draft its new constitution. Following that assignment, he was involved in the training of judges and lawyers in international human rights law with the Pacific Regional Rights Resource Team. In July 2011, he was appointed as the new director of the Centre for the Independence of Judges and Lawyers; he left this organisation in March 2012.\n\nIt was revealed on 6 March 2006 that Leung had been elected onto the Council of the Commonwealth Lawyers Association. Founded in 1983, the Council is a professional association of lawyers working to uphold the rule of law among the 53-member Commonwealth of Nations. Leung is the second lawyer from a Pacific Islands nation to serve on the Council. The first was Ms. Alofa Seruvatu, former Secretary of the Fiji Law Society, who was elected in 2004. He was re-elected to the Council of the CLA in February 2011 at a meeting in Hyderabad, India. He is currently a senior Vice-President of Law Asia. He is also on the executive of the International Bar Association's Pro Bono and Access to Justice Committee.\n\nLeung grew up in Levuka, Fiji, but now resides in Nauru, where he took up a short term contract in September 2014 as Solicitor General of the Republic.\n"}

Later these structures came to be called \"zanāneh\" (feminine residence), \"andaruni\" (inner private zone) and \"haram\" (from Arabic harem).\n\nA shabestan can be cooled using a qanat in conjunction with a windcatcher. A windcatcher is a chimney-like structure positioned above the house; the one of its four openings opposite the wind direction is opened to move air out of the house. Incoming air is pulled from a qanat below the house. The air flow across the vertical shaft opening creates a lower pressure (see Bernoulli effect) and pulls cool air up from the qanat tunnel below the house. The air from the qanat was drawn into the tunnel at some distance away and is cooled both by contact with the cool tunnel walls/water and by the giving up of latent heat of evaporation as water evaporates into the air stream. In dry desert climates this can result in a greater than 15 °C (27 °F) reduction in the air temperature coming from the qanat. Windcatchers and qanat cooling have been used in desert climates for over 1000 years.\n\n"}

{"id": "1933830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933830", "title": "Battle of Malta", "text": "Battle of Malta\n\nThe Battle of Malta took place on 8 July 1283 in the entrance to the Grand Harbour, the principal harbour of Malta, as part of the War of the Sicilian Vespers. An Aragonese fleet of galleys, commanded by Roger of Lauria, attacked and defeated a fleet of Angevin galleys commanded by Guillaume Cornut and Bartholomé Bonvin.\n\nThe Angevin ships arrived in Malta first, and proceeded to relieve the Angevin garrison, which was besieged within the walls of the \"Castello del Mare\". The galleys were followed in close pursuit by an Aragonese fleet. Roger of Lauria easily out-maneuvered the Angevin-Provençal fleet, and destroyed almost all of Cornut and Bonvin's vessels. Lauria then sailed back northwards, making a demonstration off Naples, raided the neighbouring coast, attacked and then garrisoned Capri and Ischia. The crushing defeat forced Charles I of Naples to postpone his plan to invade Sicily.\n\nFollowing the rebellion of the Sicilian populace against the Angevins, the Maltese rose in a general insurrection on the islands in the autumn of 1282, bolstered by an Aragonese contingent led by Manfred de Lancia, who was Roger of Lauria's brother-in-law. The Aragonese besiegers were also led by Corrado I Lancia, first count of Caltanissetta, and brother of Manfred. The Provençal soldiers found themselves restricted in the \"Castello del Mare\" in the Grand Harbour, an ancient citadel which occupied one of the headlands marking the harbour, and the castle's suburb of Birgu. At this point the Castello del Mar was reinforced. Malta stood in a strategic location, with both sides anxious to control it.\n\nWhile at Marseilles, Charles I of Naples sent for Guillaume Cornut. The latter was a mercenary from an ancient Marseillais family, who was tasked by King Charles to set up a recruiting table to man twenty-five galleys with which to set sail at once for Sicily, and relieve the castle of Malta. By May 1283, the Angevin troops in the \"Castello del Mare\" had already been besieged for almost six months. The King bade Cornut to recruit \"\"...men of good birth, all of Marseilles and of the coast of Provence, and not to put in a man of any other nation, but only true Provençals, and to provide them with boatswains and steersmen, and the prows should have double armament.\"\"\n\nUpon providing relief to the Angevin soldiers besieged in Malta, Cornut was then ordered to \"\"seek Roger of Lauria, who had not more than eighteen galleys, for the King of Aragon had not ordered more than twenty-two to be fitted out, and of these he had taken four to Catalonia, and so there did not remain more than eighteen.\"\" The Angevin plan was to either capture or destroy these vessels, and gain mastery of the sea.\n\nIn May 1283, the twenty-five Angevin-Provençal galleys equipped by Cornut, and also led by Bartholomé Bonvin arrived in Naples from Marseilles, where they refreshed their men. The two admirals then set sail from Naples, with a total of about eighteen galleys, eight or nine barques, and a \"panfilus\".\n\nThe Angevins set sail around Sicily, by way of the Aeolian Islands and Ustica, then off Trapani and the west end of the island. The fleet avoided the Strait of Messina, which was in Aragonese hands. According to Ramon Muntaner, the Angevins had sent three light scouting galleys, towards the \"Boca del Faro\", in front of the small tower of the Messina lighthouse. These three vessels were told rejoin the rest of the fleet at the castle of Malta.\n\nRoger of Lauria, following the instructions of the King of Aragon, equipped twenty-five galleys. Four of these, and a smaller vessel, were sent on to Trapani and to the King of Aragon. The remainder, namely, twenty-one galleys and two smaller vessels, were armed and manned with Catalans and Latins. Lauria took the smaller fleet, and raided the coast of Calabria, as far as La Castella d'Isola di Capo Rizzuto. The troops raided inland, attacking towns and homesteads.\n\nAfter scouring Calabria, Lauria returned with the fleet to Messina. Upon entering the Strait of Messina from the east, Aragonese scouts met the three Provençal galleys which Cornut had sent into the Strait to reconnoitre. The Angevin scout ships were resting for the night, awaiting news. Lauria quickly organised his galleys and having surrounded the three Angevin scouts, blocked their escape.\n\nRoger of Lauria soon learned all the Angevin plans regarding Malta. He quickly set sail for Messina, taking the three Angevin vessels with him. After landing his men and taking aboard fresh recruits, he left Messina and set sail for Malta. On his first sailing day he made for Syracuse, and asked for news on the Angevin-Provençal fleet. A barge had arrived from Gozo with news that the enemy fleet was already at Malta. The day after, the Aragonese set sail southwards, leaving Syracuse and reaching Capo Passero. After resting overnight, the Aragonese fleet set sail for the south east coast of Sicily, rather than head for Malta directly. After putting in at Fonte di Scicli, Lauria landed all his men to rest in Scicli to prepare themselves for the coming battle.\n\nBefore leaving Scicli, the Aragonese took with them a small barge, with eight oars. Their plan was to use it to scout Grand Harbour secretly, without being seen. The fleet embarked early, and reached the entrance of Grand Harbour at daybreak, just before matins.\n\nTwo small scouting galleys entered the port, led by the small barge at a \"\"distance of a cross-bow shot.\"\" The barge entered through the port's channel straight in the middle, with the other scouting ships remaining on guard at each of the points of the harbour's entrance. The barge approached the castle, and found all the Angevin galleys with their oars unshipped and beached. Counting twenty-two galleys and two smaller ships the Aragonese barge then returned to Lauria to report its findings.\n\nRoger of Lauria ordered his followers to put on their armour and set his galleys in order of battle. The Aragonese sailors wanted to enter harbour quickly and use the element of surprise, crying to \"\"Let us attack, for they are all ours.\"\" Lauria refused and bade his sailors to blow their trumpets and announce their arrival in the harbour, saying that he did not wish that anyone would say that the Aragonese had only defeated their enemies because they found them sleeping. Muntaner explains that this was Lauria's first battle since being made admiral, speculating that he wished to show his naval prowess.\n\nLauria sounded his trumpets and began to enter Grand Harbour with his galleys formed in line and lashed together. The Provençals awoke and found Lauria's ships with raised oars. A hundred noble Frenchmen quickly came down from the castle, and reinforced the sailors in the galleys which put to sea. Cornut sounded his trumpets, hoisted his sails and set his galley onto Lauria's.\n\nThe fleets met in the middle of Grand Harbour, in an \"\"attack so vigorous, that the prow of every galley was shattered, and the battle was most cruel and fierce.\"\" Crucially, as soon as the Provençals opened their volleys of arrows and missiles, Lauria ordered all his men, except the crossbowmen, to shelter in the galley's forecastles and behind the ship's bulwarks and hold their fire. Word was passed through to the sailors to hurl no weapons whatsoever until the Angevins' barrage stopped. The Aragonese \"\"suffered the attack of the Provençal galleys wherefrom stones and lances and lime were cast in such deluge that the sight thereof was most fearful to behold.\"\" Only at midday, when the Angevins had depleted their missile munitions, did Lauria allow his troops to fire upon the Angevin ships. The Catalans' marksmanship, particularly their almogavars and their crossbowmen carried the battle for the Aragonese.\n\nDetaching their lashings, the individual Aragonese galleys then moved in for the ship-to-ship assault. Once the Angevin galleys were grappled, the almogavars boarded the enemy ships, with the exhausted and heavily armoured French knights being no match for the agile Aragonese infantry.\n\nThe battle, which had begun at sunrise, lasted until the hour of vespers, with Muntaner remarking that \"\"never could any man see more cruel a battle.\"\" Although the Provençals had one more galley, and had been reinforced by a hundred men of rank from the castle, the Angevins could not hold their own against the Aragonese. Muntaner reports that before vespers a \"\"full three thousand five hundred of the Provençals had been killed.\"\" On the boarded Angevins galleys, all who were found on deck were killed such that between the wounded and all those who hid below, \"\"not five hundred men came out alive.\"\" Cornut, his kinsmen friends and the men of rank from the castle were all massacred. Muntaner states that Cornut fell in single-combat with Lauria. Desclot indicates that 860 prisoners were taken in the battle.\n\nThe Aragonese captured the remaining Angevin galleys, with one of the lighter Angevin scouting ships managing to put out to sea and escape. The ship, according to Muntaner, made its way to Naples and Marseilles with news of the Angevin disaster. However, Desclot mentions that Bartholomé Bonvin managed to force his way through the Aragonese fleet with about seven galleys – two of which were so heavily damaged they had to be abandoned. The rest were either sunk, or captured.\n\nLauria took his galleys and landed his troops on the western point of Grand Harbour, with his losses counted at three hundred dead and two hundred injured. At once, the Aragonese sent an armed barge to Syracuse, to make their victory known, while ten captured Angevin galleys were added to the fleet. Lauria ordered the King's officials in the city to send runners to Messina and to the rest of the Sicily. A captured Angevin fast ship was quickly manned and sent on to Catalonia, to the King of Aragon. Passing by Mallorca and Barcelona, the vessel sent a runner to inform the Aragonese court with the good news.\n\nThe Aragonese admiral gave up the King's share and his own right to the booty won by his soldiers, declaring the galleys and the Angevin prisoners to be enough. His soldiers gave Lauria their thanks, and rested for two days.\n\nAfter resting his men for two days, Lauria advanced with his banners raised on the city of Malta. The notables pleaded with him not to do any damage, saying that the city would put itself in the keeping and the command of the King of Aragon, and that Malta would surrender to Lauria. The admiral entered the city with his troops, and received the homage of the city and the island. Lauria left two hundred men to secure and garrison the city against the Angevins in the \"Castello del Mare\". Lauria then briefly attempted to besiege the castle, but finding it impossible without catapults and siege equipment, he was forced to raise the siege.\n\nThe notables of Malta gave Lauria one thousand \"onzas\" in jewels and precious stones, as well as enough provisions to allow a safe passage to Messina. Then, Lauria set sail for Gozo, attacking the island and taking its ravelin. The city surrendered immediately, and received one hundred Catalan soldiers under the same terms as Malta. The men of Gozo gave jewels to the value of five hundred \"onzas\", and further provisions for the Aragonese galleys.\n\nSetting course for Sicily, the Aragonese fleet landed at Syracuse, and thence to Aci and Taormina. The victorious fleet was celebrated at every Sicilian harbour it landed.\n\nMuntaner asserts that after sharing the victory in Malta, the Aragonese and the Sicilians united themselves in the \"\"bonds of friendship...which is an incontestable proof of good government\".\"\n\nThe crushing defeat forced the postponement of Angevin plans to invade Sicily, established Aragonese naval tactic superiority and set the scene for the Battle of the Gulf of Naples in 1284. The Aragonese fleet continued to sail back northwards, and after making a demonstration off Naples, and raiding the neighbouring coast, Lauria attacked and then garrisoned the islands of Capri and Ischia.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n"}

It is determined by points awarded for placings in the daily stages, regardless of time gaps. From 1967 to 1969 the leader wore a red jersey but in 1970 it was changed to mauve, and named the \"maglia ciclamino\" (from Italian: \"mauve jersey\"), the name of the colour in Italian being derived from the alpine flower the cyclamen. The red jersey was re-introduced in 2010, as the \"maglia rosso passione\". However, in April 2017 RCS Sport, the organisers of the Giro, announced that the \"maglia ciclamino\" would be revived for the 2017 Giro d'Italia.\n\nThe first points classification in the Giro was used in 1958, called \"Trofeo A. Carli\". The first rider in each stage was given 15 points, down to one point for the fifteenth rider. There was no jersey associated, and the next year it was not used again.\n\nThe ranking points system was reintroduced in 1966, when there was no associated jersey, while for the two subsequent editions a red jersey was awarded to the leader of the classification. From 1969 to 2009, the jersey was mauve, but often referred to as \"cyclamen\".\n\nPoints are given to riders who finish among the first in a stage, independent of the time difference. There are also points given to the first cyclists to reach the intermediate sprints. There is an intermediate sprints competition, with names changing from year to year, (Intergiro, Expo Milano 2015, Traguardo Volante), which used to give a blue jersey to its leader.\n\nAmong the winners of the points classification are Mario Cipollini (three times), Alessandro Petacchi and in 2006 the future world champion Paolo Bettini.\n\nAt the other grand tours, the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, there are also points classifications; the points classification in the Tour de France rewards a green jersey to its leader, as does the points classification in the Vuelta a España.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2013, the winner of each stage receives 25 points, independent of the type of stage (unlike the better known points classification in the Tour de France, where winning a mountain stage gives fewer points than winning flat stage). The next cyclist receives 20 points, the next ones 16, 14, 12, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, until the fifteenth cyclist who receives one point.\nEvery stage (excluding time trials) also has an intermediate sprint. The first to cross that sprint receives 8 points, the next one 6 points, the next ones 4, 3, 2, until the sixth cyclist who receives one point.\n\nIn 2014 this was changed so that there are three levels of stages, each with its own point classification scheme. The first level, presumably the flat stages, will award points to 20 riders on a scale from 50 to 1 point. Level two stages will award points to the top 15 riders on a scale of 25 to 1 and level three stages will award points to the top 10 riders on a scale of 15 to 1 point. Points at intermediate sprints will follow a similar scale.\n\nIf two or more cyclists have the same number of points, the ranking is determined by the most number of stage victories, followed by the most number of intermediate sprint victories, followed by the lowest time in the general classification.\n\n\nAs of 2019, 9 cyclists have won the Points classification in the Giro d'Italia more than once.\nRiders from twelve different countries have won the Points classification in the Giro d'Italia.\n\nThe Azzurri d'Italia classification (\"Azure or Sky Blue Italy\") is an award in the Giro d'Italia in which points are awarded to the top three stage finishers (4, 2 and 1 point). It is similar to the standard points classification for which the leader and final winner are awarded the red jersey but no jersey is awarded for this classification, only a cash prize to the overall winner. For the 2007 Giro d'Italia, the Azzurri d'Italia winner won € 5,000.\n\n"}

The term may have been coined by marketing professionals and psychologists, later becoming a subculture of its own. The term was introduced in the 1950s to refer to teenagers who mainly listened to popular music and/or rock and roll and not much else. \"Teenybopper\" became widely used again in the late 1960s and early 1970s, following an increase in the marketing of pop music, teen idols and fashions aimed specifically at younger girls, generally 10–15 years old.\n\nThe subculture is exclusive to young girls. As a subculture, it is a \"retreat and preparation\", allowing girls to relate to their peers and \"practice in the secrecy of girl culture the rituals of courtship away from the eye of male ridicule\", also having no risks of standing out or personal humiliation, and serving as a retreat to avoid being labeled sexually. It also allows young girls to participate in semi-masturbatory rituals, since they don't have access to the masturbatory rituals common among boys. While the subculture allows them to have a space of their own, the subculture magazines offer an idealized relation with the teen idols, always implying a subordination of the female to the male, anticipating that the subordination will keep being present in their future relationships, and presenting an idealized form of marriage.\n\nThe narrative fantasies elaborated around teenyboppers serve as distractions from boring, unrewarding, or demanding aspects of life, such as school or work, and as a defensive means against the authoritarian structures at school. When shared with other teenyboppers, it allows for defensive solidarity. It allows its members to define themselves apart from younger and older girls. Their groups, like all girl groups, will rarely go above four, unlike boys, who prefer bigger numbers.\n\nIt has a commercial origin and is \"an almost packaged cultural commodity\", emerging from the pop business and relying on commercial magazines and TV. As a result, it has fewer creative elements than other subcultures.\n\nMembership has very few restrictions, does not require elaborate spending, and requires much less competence and money than certain school activities. Because its members don't have as much freedom as their male counterparts, the subculture is suited to being followed at school or home, and they can hold a party with just a bedroom, a music player and permission to invite friends.\n\nIn the 1960s, a new type of music appeared, different from the Tin Pan Alley music school, but moulded by it. It was no longer written by the old established songwriters of Tin Pan Alley, but by young people. They helped to establish the new teen idols and wrote the so-called \"teeny bopper songs\", which \"blend soft rock with pop ballad, is not explicitly physical and only hints at sexual interaction.\n\nThe difference that the 70s' \"Teeny Bopper syndrome\" had with prior idol phenomena was that these new teen idols were directed at even younger girls, down to 15 years old, who were too young to have heard The Beatles and were not attracted to the new hard rock music of the time that their elder siblings listened to. This new market has a quick turnover potential and it boosted the benefits of many broadcasting companies.\n\nThe teenybopper idol image is that of the young boy next door, with its key elements being self-pity, vulnerability and need. Their music is consumed by young girls, who collect posters and pin ups.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1933854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933854", "title": "Technical University of Madrid", "text": "Technical University of Madrid\n\nThe Technical University of Madrid or sometimes called Polytechnic University of Madrid (, UPM) is a Spanish university, located in Madrid. It was founded in 1971 as the result of merging different Technical Schools of Engineering and Architecture, originating mainly in the 18th century. Over 35,000 students attend classes during the year.\n\nAccording to the annual university ranking conducted by \"El Mundo\", the Technical University of Madrid ranks as the top technical university in Spain, and second overall. The majority of its Engineering Schools are consistently ranked as leading academic institutions in Spain in their fields, and among the very best in Europe.\n\nThe UPM is part of the TIME network, which groups fifty engineering schools throughout Europe.\n\nThe Technical University of Madrid (UPM) was founded in 1971, although the majority of its Centres are over hundreds of years old and were founded in the 18th and 19th centuries. Each of them maintained their independence until being grouped together to form the UPM in 1971. It is no exaggeration to state that for over one and a half centuries great part of the history of Spanish technology has been written by the Schools of Architecture and Engineering of the UPM. They have been during a lot of years nearly the only and in some cases actually the only school. All of the important personalities in the area of teaching and research passed through their respective centres as students or lecturers.\n\nOne of the oldest records of technological studies in Spain is the Royal Academy of Mathematics in Madrid, leaving aside the Quatrivium of arithmetics, geometry, astronomy and music, the four liberal arts, that form the base of the technical disciplines, which were studied in the monastic and cathedral schools and later in the medieval and renaissance universities. The Royal Academy of Mathematics was created after the idea and personal initiative of King Philip II after his return from a visit to Portugal in 1582, where he realised that the Portuguese cartographers were more advanced than those in Spain. The Academy did not award qualifications that entitled to exercise a profession. Its prestige was based on the lecturers and subjects taught. Cartographers, pilots, architects and engineers were trained in a way that the latter two started to gain a certain degree of recognition. In 1643 the Academy was closed down. The second relevant record of technological studies was the Corps of Army, Cities, Ports and Frontiers Engineers founded by King Philip V in 1711. This date marked the foundation of the Spanish engineers as an organised profession. In 1716, for their training, the Royal Military School of Mathematics in Barcelona was created, even if it was not opened until 1720 and besides was limited to a strictly military context.\n\nAmong all the subjects that nowadays form part of the Technical University of Madrid, the first to start specific and concrete lectures and not in a generalised manner, as it was the case of engineering that started with a military background, was architecture, years before the School and the Academy of Fine Arts were created. The Foundation Assembly of the Royal Academy of the Three Noble Arts of Saint Ferdinand was held on 18.07.1744 in the home of G.D. Olivieri, first sculptor to the king since 1741 where he had a private academy and its studies prepared the way for the ones that were officially regulated in the assembly. Twelve lecturers, four for each subject where appointed. The classes of the new School that depended on the Academy of Fine Arts started in the Casa de la Panadería in the Plaza Mayor of Madrid and continued there until 1773 when the Academy moved to its present building.\n\nAlthough the Special School of Fine Arts was founded in 1845 as an independent entity, it was at the beginning under the inspection and monitoring of the Academy. At present the Higher Technical School of Architecture is located in a modern building in the Ciudad Universitaria in Madrid.\n\nKing Charles III ordered on 13.08.1772 the foundation of the School of Naval Architecture for the training of the future members of the Corps of Naval Architects (24.12.1770). The academy was opened in El Ferrol. After several years of teaching a series of difficulties led to the closure of the centre. French naval architects were taken on after intense negotiations and the centre was reopened in the Arsenal de la Carraca in Cadiz in 1848. Today's School of Naval Architects, located in the Ciudad Universitaria, is one out of two UPM schools that started with a military background and is completely civilian nowadays. Several years later the same happened in the School of Aeronautics.\n\nThe School of Mining Engineering was the first that from the day of its foundation had a civil character. It was established in 1777 by the orders of King Charles III of Spain in Almadén, Ciudad Real, where already some type of informal teaching existed, in order to make use of a very important element: the mercury mines. Mercury was in those days an irreplaceable material for the amalgamation of silver, which was one of the key sources of wealth in Latin America, especially in Mexico. This School started its activities in a similar historical context to that of other centres such as those in Saxony (Freiberg 1767), Hungary (Schmnitz 1770) and France (Paris 1778).\n\nThe center was transferred to the Mexican viceroyalty, and it remained there until the end of the Mexican Independence War from Spain. It was then transferred to Madrid where the Interior Minister, Martín de los Heros, inaugurated the premises on 7.01.1835.\nA new building for the School of Mining Engineering of Madrid was inaugurated in the 1890s.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, in 1802, the School of Civil Engineering, considered the best one in Spain, was founded at the initiative of Augustin de Bethencourt, an outstanding representative of the eloquent restless and inquiring spirit of the Spanish Enlightenment. It was located in the Palacio del Buen Retiro in Madrid until May 1808.\n\nAt the beginning of the academic year 1889-90, students and professors continued their activity in the new building in Alfonso XII Street, where the School remained until it moved to its current location in the Ciudad Universitaria in Madrid.\n\nThis school has been classified by El Mundo as the best Civil Engineering School in Spain, and its six-year degree has been certified by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).\n\nA Royal Decree created the Special School of Forestry Engineering in 1835, although it did not start its activity until 1848 in Villaviciosa de Odón, Madrid. The first graduates of the School of Villaviciosa created the Corps of Forestry Engineers. Its current premises are in the Ciudad Universitaria in Madrid.\n\nThe industrial engineers' lectures descend from the Patriotic Seminar of Vergara and the activities of the Economic Associations of Friends of the Country. José I in Madrid opened the Arts Conservatory, an imitation of the one in Paris, in 1809. The Royal Decree (18.08.1842) reopened it with the same name but within a short period of time it was again shut down. The Minister of Trade, Seijas Lozano, signed a Royal Decree (4.10.1850) in order to create the Royal Industrial Institute and the degree in Industrial Engineering.\n\nThe Minister of Public Works, Manuel Alonso Martínez, founded the Central Agriculture School on 1 October 1855. At first it was set up on the \"La Flamenca\" estate on the Royal Property in Aranjuez. It was closed on 3 November 1868 and by another Decree (28.01.1869) immediately moved to Madrid. Ratified by several legal norms, it was given the so-called \"La Florida\" or \"La Moncloa\" property, the present University Campus of Madrid, as well as other nearby land. The new building of the Agricultural Institute of Alfonso XII was constructed on the property. Later it was called National Agronomy Institute and today Higher Technical School of Agricultural Engineering of Madrid. Among other studies, it hosts the Bachelor's Degree in Biotechnology, which has the highest admission grade requirement of the whole university (12.914/14).\n\nThe General School of Telegraphy was the first of the three Higher Schools to be created in the 20th century. It was founded by a Decree (3.06.1913) with three sections and another Decree (22.04.1920) created the qualification of Telecommunication Engineer. From 1912 to 1935 it was located in a building on Paseo de Recoletos in Madrid, until 1936 on Ferraz Street, then on Conde de Peñalver Street until it was finally transferred to the Ciudad Universitaria in Madrid.\nIt is one of the best reputed telecommunication schools in Spain. In fact, their telecommunications degree has been an ABET accredited program since 2008.\n\nIn 1926 and 1928 the qualification of Aeronautical Engineer and the Higher School of Aeronautical Engineering, located near the airfield of Cuatro Vientos in Madrid, were created almost simultaneously. The Military Academy of Aeronautical Engineering was set up by a Decree (15.10.1939) and by another recovered its civilian character. The Technical Education Organisation Law (20.07.1957) provided it with its current name of Higher Technical School of Aeronautical Engineering. It was established in a modern building in the Ciudad Universitaria in Madrid. Currently with the Bologna plan the degree taught is Aerospace Engineering. The school of engineering is now called ETSIAE (Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingenieros Aeronáuticos y del Espacio) and is the best institution in Spain to carry out aeronautical studies. Additionally is one of the most difficult studies in the Spanish education system.\n\nThe newest of the centres is the School of Computer Sciences. Madrid's Institute of Computer Sciences was created in 1969 outside the university framework until the studies in 1976 became part of the University and simultaneously the School of Computer Sciences was set up. From the first day of lectures in October 1977, it was integrated into the UPM. Since 1988 it has been located on the campus of Montegancedo.\n\nThe School of Computer Sciences offers the first Spanish undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Computer Sciences. The program condenses studies of mathematics and computer sciences into one degree, placing special emphasis on the mathematical foundations of computer science and computer-based tools for mathematics. It combines mathematics and informatics subjects, focusing on fields where the two are most relevant to each other and stressing the interrelationships between the two disciplines to shape a degree course that is being successfully taught at leading world universities such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US, the University of Oxford in the UK or Université Pierre et Marie Curie in France.\n\nSince 14 September 1998 the Faculty of Physical Activity and Sport Sciences (INEF) was an affiliated centre and on 1 October 2003 was integrated to our University.\n\nThe University Schools of Technical Engineering were mainly set up at the same time as the Higher Technical Schools to provide training for Assistants or Technicians. However, these names gradually disappeared and gave way to the present names and qualifications.\n\nTraditionally, in Spain there were two levels of technical studies. For engineering studies there was a 3-year degree called (Technical Engineer, roughly equivalent to a BSc) with all powers and legal authority in their field and a 5- or 6-year degree called (Engineer, roughly equivalent to a MSc). In the case of architecture studies there was a 3-year degree called (Technical Architect) and a 5-year degree called (Senior Architect). Those degrees disappeared as a result of the Bologna process and the new structure features 4-year BSc degrees and 1- or 2-year MSc degrees maintaining the same professional and legal responsibilities that previously called technical engineers with master's degrees on top. Technical University of Madrid access grades rank as the highest in their fields every year.\n\nSome of the degrees still or partially offered at the UPM are:\n\nUPM's Schools are spread all over Madrid, instead of being placed in a unified campus. They are:\n\n\nThe Scientific and Technological Park of the UPM (“Parque UPM”) represents a significant boost to the University's R&D&i activity through the creation of new R&D&i centres, business incubators, and specialized laboratories, with the backing and participation of public and private institutions.\n\nThe concept of “Parque UPM” covers various scientific and technological areas linked with engineering and architecture. It is geographically distributed in various sites, all of which are located in the region of Madrid (Comunidad Autónoma de Madrid): South Campus, Montegancedo and Getafe.\n\n\nThe UPM has signed 87 specific double degree agreements with centres of excellence at a number of worldwide Universities.\n\nA double degree gives the best students the opportunity to study for an international degree by combining studies in two types of engineering, at the same time as it prepares them better for their future career. On completing their studies, students will simultaneously obtain a degree from the UPM in addition to a degree from the foreign university they have attended.\n\nA list of the Universities that have double degree programs with the UPM is shown above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UPM has Erasmus agreement with most of European engineering schools. Moreover, it has many other international agreements. Here a summary of the different international agreements.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The term is also sometimes used in a similar way to describe the shell of a cephalopod mollusk.\n\nIn gastropods, the body whorl, or last whorl, is the most recently formed and largest whorl (or revolution) of a spiral or helical shell, terminating in the aperture. It is called the \"body whorl\" because most of the body of the soft parts of the animal fits into this whorl.\n\nThe proportional size of the body whorl in gastropod shells differs greatly according to the actual shell morphology. For shells in which the rate of whorl expansion of each revolution around the axis is very high, the aperture and the body whorl are large, and the shell tends to be low spired. The shell of the abalone is a good example of this kind of shell.\n\nThe opposite tendency can sometimes create a high spire with very little whorl increase per revolution. In these instances, e.g. in the shell of \"Turritella\" species, both the body whorl and the aperture are relatively small.\n\nIn mollusc shells where there is no elevation at all to the spire, and only moderate whorl expansion, the body whorl can sometimes still represent a large part of the shell, e.g. in some species in the family Planorbidae, such as the genus \"Segmentina\".\n\nThe body chamber or living chamber in shelled cephalopod mollusks is an equivalent space, and is also sometimes called the body whorl. It is the outermost or last chamber in the shell of a nautiloid or ammonoid. The body of the animal occupies the living chamber, apart from the siphuncle which extends through the rest of the septa (the phragmocone) to provide buoyancy.\n"}

Hausner has been described as a \"psychic realist\" and \"the first psychoanalytical painter\" (Gunter Engelhardt).\n\nOf Jewish origins, Hausner studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna from 1931 until 1936. \n\nIn 1944, Hausner married Irene Schmied. During the last days of the second world war he was assigned to an air defense unit. After the war, he returned to his bomb-damaged studio and resumed work as an artist. In 1946 he founded a surrealist group together with Edgar Jené, Ernst Fuchs, Wolfgang Hutter and Fritz Janschka. They were later joined by Arik Brauer and Anton Lehmden. He joined the Art-Club and had his first one-man exhibition in the Konzerthaus, Vienna. A key work of this period, \"It's me!\" (1948; Vienna, Hist. Mus.), shows his awareness of Pittura Metafisica and Surrealism in a psychoanalytical painting where the elongated being in the foreground penetrates what was apparently a real landscape, until it tears like a backdrop; another painting, \"Forum of Inward-turned Optics\" (1948; Vienna, Hist. Mus.), is evidence of his ability to depict the subject in a realist style while simultaneously overturning the laws of one-point perspective. He married Hermine Jedliczka in 1951; their daughter Xenia Hausner, also an artist, was born the same year. After working on the painting for six years, he completed his masterpiece, \"The Ark of Odysseus\", in 1956. \"The Ark of Odysseus\" (1948–51 and 1953-6; Vienna, Hist. Mus.), depicts the hero as a self-portrait and was a precursor to the series of Adam paintings in which Hausner painted his own features.\n\nIn 1957, Hausner painted his first \"Adam\" picture. He came into conflict with the Surrealist orthodoxy, who condemned as heretical his attempt to give equal importance to both conscious and unconscious processes. In 1959 he co-founded the Vienna School of Fantastic Realism together with his old surrealist group members: Ernst Fuchs, Fritz Janschka, Wolfgang Hutter, Anton Lehmden and Arik Brauer. In 1962, Hausner met Paul Delvaux, René Magritte, Victor Brauner, and Dorothea Tanning while traveling in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. The 1st Burda Prize for Painting was awarded to him in 1967. In 1969, he was awarded the Prize of the City of Vienna. Shortly after, he separated from Hermine Jedliczka and moved to Hietzing together with his daughter Xenia and Anne Wolgast, whom he had met in Hamburg.\n\nFrom 1966 until 1980, he was a guest professor at the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg. He also taught at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna. Among his students were Oz Almog, Joseph Bramer, Friedrich Hechelmann, Gottfried Helnwein, F. Scott Hess, Michael Engelhardt, and Siegried Goldberger. Hausner was awarded the Austrian State Prize for Painting in 1970.\n\n"}

The UP Express began operation on 6 June 2015, in time for the 2015 Pan American Games. The UP Express travels between Union and Pearson in 25 minutes departing every 15 minutes, seven days a week. At the launch announcement, it was stated that the UP Express was projected to carry 2.35million passengers annually and eliminate approximately 1.2million car trips in the first year.\n\nUP Express is operated as an independent division of Metrolinx, similarly to GO Transit. An airport rail link was one of the priority projects identified in Metrolinx's regional transportation plan, \"The Big Move\". Construction began in 2011 as part of the Georgetown South Project, which expanded the rail corridor the UP Express shares with GO Transit and Via Rail. UP Express uses diesel multiple unit (DMU) trains that meet United States Environmental Protection Agency Tier 4 emission standards. The Kitchener line and UP Express will be electrified, although no date has been set. The UP Express has been criticized for not using electric trains from the outset, and for its initial fare prices that were high compared with other North American airport–city connections.\n\nImproved transit connections to Pearson Airport have been of interest since the late 1980s. Before the specific pursuit of an airport rail link, three formal studies were conducted, and released in 1989, 1990 and 1991. The last two presented options for either making a connection from the GO Georgetown (later extended and renamed Kitchener) train line or the Toronto Transit Commission's (TTC) Line 2 Bloor–Danforth.\n\nTransport Canada made a request for proposal for an airport rail link in April 2001. In May 2003, the submissions were pared down to four pre-qualified private consortia, who were then invited to submit business cases. An SNC-Lavalin subsidiary named the Union Pearson AirLink Group was selected as the successful respondent to finance, design, construct, operate and maintain an airport rail link on 13 November 2003. The service was to be called \"Blue22\", as a trip would take 22 minutes to or from Pearson with a stop at the Bloor GO/Dundas West TTC Station. Trains were to be refurbished Budd Rail Diesel Cars, and were expected to begin running between 2008 and 2010.\nBy 2008, there had not been significant progress on the project because of failed consensus in negotiations, regulatory hurdles and community opposition. In June 2008, the Ontario government revised the environmental assessment process from a required three-year period to six months, and later that summer it resumed negotiations with Union Pearson AirLink Group on terms for a public-private partnership. Furthermore, the high-speed link received public statements of strong support from Premier of Ontario Dalton McGuinty, Toronto Mayor David Miller and the federal government.\n\nIn November 2008, Metrolinx, the Ontario government agency for Greater Toronto and Hamilton transportation, released its regional transportation plan titled \"The Big Move\", outlining how an airport rail link was part of a strategy to establish multi-directional high-order transit connectivity to the Pearson Airport district, in addition to the Mississauga Transitway, rapid transit corridors along Highways 427 and 407, and light rail transit lines along Eglinton and Finch Avenues. In December 2008, Metrolinx became the proponent of new EA that would simultaneously assess a combination of both the UP Express and GO Transit's Georgetown South expansion. The final Environmental Project Report was released on 30 July 2009.\n\nAfter two years of failed negotiations and financing difficulties, the public-private partnership between Ontario and the Union Pearson AirLink Group was called off in July 2010, and Metrolinx was handed responsibility to directly own and operate the service. Metrolinx established the new operating division that would become Union Pearson Express. The name 'Air Rail Link' was used as a placeholder until the official name was unveiled on 29 November 2012.\n\nMetrolinx largely preserved the same project scope as had been approved in the environmental assessment, with the service designed for air travellers rather than for conventional commuters. Changes from SNC Lavalin's former proposal included refinements to take into account synergies with GO Transit. In November 2010, the Board of Directors of Metrolinx authorized its staff to enter into negotiations with Sumitomo Corporation of America to supply Diesel Multiple Units (DMUs); the contract was approved by the Board in February 2011 and executed on 31 March 2011. Kathy Haley was named the first president of the division in July 2011.\n\nIt was announced on 24 October 2011 that the consortium AirLinx Transit Partners had been selected to complete building the UP Express. The consortium comprises some of Canada's largest construction companies such as Aecon and Dufferin Construction. Construction on the spur line and passenger station at Pearson began in the spring of 2012, at a cost of $128.6million. As of 2010, the entire project was expected to cost C$456million.\n\nUndertaken as part of the Georgetown South Project, the work consisted of five new road overpasses and two road underpasses, one railway grade separation, one bridge reconstruction and the widening of 15 other bridges, construction/re-construction of four stations, major track and grading construction, signal installations utility relocations, as well as the new elevated spur to and from the airport. This work was conducted while minimizing disruption to existing train operations, local residents and businesses. A new rail tunnel under Highway 401 was still required at a later date to meet future ridership demands. Construction of tunnels for two tracks began in July 2019 and is expected to be completed in late 2021.\n\nService began on 6 June 2015, operated by the Union Pearson Express division of Metrolinx. With an adult one-way fare of $27.50 cash or $19.00 with a Presto card, the service was criticized for being the most expensive airport rail link service in North America; the fare was later reduced.\n\nDuring the 2016 Family Day weekend, the Union Pearson Express offered free rides to everyone. It resulted in lineups approximately two hours long at both ends of the line as more than 28,000 passengers took advantage of the opportunity.\n\nA new fare structure was introduced on 9 March 2016, which reduced the one-way ticket price between Union and Pearson from $27.50 to $12.00 cash, and from $19.00 to $9.00 with a Presto card. The change also introduced GO pricing between Bloor/Weston and Union stations. President Kathy Haley stepped down on 31 March 2016, and Metrolinx announced that it was conducting an organizational review.\n\nIn 2017, the Discounted Double Fare program was introduced, which offered UP Express and GO Transit customers a discount of $1.50 when transferring to or from the TTC (equal to a 50 percent reduction of the $3.00 TTC cash fare at the time). The arrangement ended in March 2020 when the Ontario government chose not to renew provincial funding to support it.\n\nUnion Pearson Express operates daily between 4:55 am and 1:00 am every 15 minutes, making approximately 140 trips per day.\n\n From Union Station, the UP Express heads northwest along the existing GO Transit Kitchener line. This section of track between Bathurst Street and Highway 427 was upgraded as part of GO's Georgetown South Project, which improved infrastructure along the route to accommodate the UP Express, GO Transit, Canadian National, and Via Rail services. The UP Express makes two intermediate stops at Bloor and Weston GO stations. Bloor Station was redesigned for better access and connection to GO Transit, and Metrolinx is working towards a future direct connection to the Dundas West subway station.\n\nBeyond Highway 427, a newly constructed rail spur carries the UP Express from the Kitchener line to the airport, forming the longest elevated rail line in Ontario. The elevated spur to Pearson Airport reaches a maximum height of , offering a view of the Downtown Toronto and Mississauga City Centre skylines. At Pearson, the UP Express arrives at Terminal 1, where riders can connect to the existing Link Train inter-terminal shuttle to Terminal 3 and the Viscount parking garage.\n\nAt Toronto Union Station, UP Express departs from a newly constructed station immediately west of the railway station of the same name, connected to it by the SkyWalk. The UP station features numerous amenities including a fully enclosed platform and waiting area, a guest services desk, a café, a gift shop and a licensed lounge.\n\nWhereas other GO Transit lines use low-floor vehicles accessed from low-level platforms, the Union Pearson Express is operated with high-floor vehicles necessitating high-level platforms. As a result, at Bloor and Weston stations, UP operates from its own dedicated platforms adjacent to the Kitchener line platforms.\n\nIt is proposed to put a stop at Mount Dennis station to connect with the under-construction Line 5 Eglinton, to be opened in 2021.\n\nThe Union Pearson Express uses Nippon Sharyo DMU trains. The fleet consists of 18 diesel multiple unit (DMU) cars, as four three-car and three two-car sets. On 1 March 2011, Metrolinx announced that it had chosen to buy 12 DMU cars (six two-car trains) from Nippon Sharyo at a cost of C$53million, for the service. This was later expanded to 18 DMU cars (adding one car to each train) via an option order. This brought the cost to US$75million. The DMUs were manufactured in Japan, assembled in Nippon Sharyo's facility in Rochelle, Illinois, and towed by rail to Toronto, with the first trainset arriving on 15 August 2014.\n\nThe trainsets seat between 115 and 173 people. On-board features include power outlets, Wi-Fi, luggage facilities, and washrooms.\n\nThe UP Express DMUs are based on the design created for the Sonoma–Marin Area Rail Transit system in California. Powered by a diesel hydraulic drive with a six-speed automatic transmission and regenerative braking, the DMUs are believed to be the first trains in the world that comply with the United States Environmental Protection Agency Tier 4 emission standards, which will reduce emissions up to 90%. Braking energy is converted into electricity by the auxiliary power generator, and helps to provide onboard lighting and heating. They also comply with FRA Tier 1 crash energy management features. Modifications for UP Express use include enclosed overhead luggage bins that comply with Transport Canada rules and an enhanced enclosed luggage tower.\n\nThe Tier 4 engines produce substantially lower emissions than most other diesel vehicles in Toronto. The Environmental Impact Assessment for the UP Express of 2009 was carried out assuming that trains would be Tier 3 standard rather than Tier 4, and showed that at peak frequency the air quality effect of the additional trains would not raise any pollution level above the provincial criterion levels. The 2010 Metrolinx electrification study, which did assume the use of Tier 4 emissions technologies for diesel propulsion options, found that the Georgetown/UP Express diesel service would contribute on the order of 0.2% to local air pollution, and that electrification would result in only a small improvement to local air quality. In an additional review of human health assessment in 2011, GO Transit examined the current plan for Tier 4 emission controls on both the UP Express trains and conversion of existing GO locomotives to Tier 4 and found that the human health risks of the diesel UP Express service are negligible, but that current background air quality (from other pollution sources in Toronto) is an issue.\n\nFares are based on age, origin and destination, and the method of payment. Discounts are available for families, round trips, and airport staff. As with other GO Transit lines, integrated train tickets can be purchased through Via Rail to railway stations across Canada. Upon launch, one-way fares on the UP Express between were $27.50, or $19 with a Presto card. By 19 June 2015, the Union Pearson Express was averaging about 3,250 riders a day, or 12 percent capacity. Metrolinx has projected that a year after opening, the service will attract 5,000 riders a day — about 1million customers. By 2020, Metrolinx expects about 2.46million rides per year will bring it up to full operating cost recovery.\n\nHowever, ridership declined in the service's opening months. Ridership in August 2015 was 17 percent lower than in June 2015 and a further 4 percent lower in the first two weeks of September. Ridership ended up averaging 2,300 per day during a four-week period in September 2015, a drop of 29 percent since June. The service needed about 7,000 riders per day to break even on operating costs. A report in February 2016 showed a drop in monthly ridership from the summer to 65,593 rides (just over 2,100 per day) in November 2015. This led Metrolinx to start considering price adjustments to boost ridership numbers.\n\nBy January 2016, average ridership slumped further to 1,967 passengers per day. Fares were reduced on 9 March 2016 to $12 for a one-way trip between Union and Pearson, or $9 with a Presto card. On the first day of reduced fares, staff counted 5,300 boardings with 40 per cent of the riders being first-time UPX users, 83 per cent being air travelers and 17 per cent being commuters. By June 2016, the daily average ridership had risen to 7,657, and a new record was set on 29 July, when the service carried more than 11,000 passengers. However, the fare reduction has lowered the total revenue collected by the UP Express, which is expected to be below what is required for its operating costs. It was revealed that since opening day to March 2016, the UP Express' provincial operating subsidy totaled $39.3million or about $52.26 per ride.\n\nIn July 2017, the most recent month for which patronage data is available, the UP Express carried an average of 10,091 passengers daily.\n\nResidents living along the Weston section of the route have objected to alterations to accommodate the GO Georgetown South corridor improvements and the addition of UP Express trains. Concerns include the division of Weston from the closing of level crossings, noise levels, air quality and property values. In April 2009, the Clean Train Coalition (CTC), representing the communities along the rail corridor, formed to put pressure on Metrolinx and the province to immediately prioritize electrification of the densely populated Georgetown South corridor and Union-Pearson Rail Link on opening day. However, both the province and Metrolinx Chairman Rob Prichard have indicated that using diesel trains is the only way to prevent significant delays. \"We believe the Greater Toronto Area needs this project as fast as possible, and that means going with the cleanest diesel technology in the world,\" stated Prichard.\n\nIn August 2012, the CTC took legal action against Metrolinx by submitting an application for judicial review. The application requested \"quashing and setting aside any decision to implement or run Diesel Multiple Units along the Air Rail Link\", on the basis that by taking direction from the Ontario government to complete the UP Express in time for the Pan American Games, a proper analysis between operating diesel and electric trains was not completed, running contrary to Metrolinx's legislated mandate. It also asserted that another review of air quality was warranted due to the World Health Organization's (WHO) reclassification of diesel exhaust as a carcinogen.\n\nSaba Ahmad, the lawyer representing the CTC, described the application as a test of whether government agencies must obey their own legislation. On 21 November 2012, the Ontario Divisional Court turned down the application, and ordered the CTC to pay $30,000 in court costs.\n\nThe Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) service offers a frequent express bus route, the 900 Airport Express, between Kipling station and Pearson. Buses depart every 10 minutes or less, and a trip from downtown to Pearson Airport takes 45 minutes for the cost of a TTC fare ($3.25 cash, $3.10 with token or Presto card).\n\nFrom 1993 until 2014, the Toronto Airport Express was a privately operated airport bus service from the airport to downtown Toronto operated by Pacific Western Transportation. The route was founded by Gray Coach in 1979. As of 2012, a \"One Ride Scheduled Service\" to or from downtown Toronto cost $26.95 and a \"One Ride On-Demand Airport Express Connect\" fare cost $29.95. A one-way trip took approximately 45 to 90 minutes, depending on traffic. The service ceased operation on 31 October 2014 due to declining ridership, popularity of the Billy Bishop Airport on Toronto Island, delays due to downtown road construction, and anticipated competition from the Union Pearson Express.\n\nOther public transit bus services are operated by Toronto Transit Commission, GO Transit, MiWay, and Brampton Transit, connecting Pearson Airport to the City of Toronto and other cities in the Greater Toronto Area.\n\n, Metrolinx is planning a major upgrade to the Union Pearson Express to better integrate it into the GO Transit rail network and to double the frequency of trains to the airport. , planning work was in its early stages and no plans had been finalized. The proposal includes:\n\nAccording to the planning document dated 22 February 2019, it is uncertain whether the UP Express infrastructure at airport Terminal 1 can be modified to accommodate electrified GO trains. There were no cost estimates for infrastructure changes.\n"}

He is well known for his exceptionally strong vocals, impeccable execution of Maqamat and harmony, as well as his charismatic performances. He has numerous admirers around the world, and is regarded as an excellent performer of authentic Arabic Tarab.\n\nSabah was born in Aleppo, Syria and enrolled in the Academy of Arabic Music of Aleppo. He later studied at the Academy of Damascus, from which he graduated in 1948. He was given the stage name \"Fakhri\" by his mentor, Syrian nationalist leader Fakhri al-Barudi, who encouraged him as a young boy to stay in Syria and not travel to Italy. One of Fakhri's earliest performances was in 1948 at the Presidential Palace in Damascus, before President Shukri al-Quwatli and Prime Minister Jamil Mardam Bey. Unlike many Arab artists, he never studied or worked in Cairo, insisting that his fame is linked to the artistic heritage of his homeland, Syria.\n\nSabah Fakhri is one of the very few singers from Arabic-speaking countries to have reached widespread popularity by singing in the Arabic language (including Europe, Asia, the Americas, and Australia). His name is enshrined in the Guinness Book of Records for his prowess in Caracas, Venezuela, where he sang continuously for 10 hours without pause.\n\nIn 1998, Fakhri became a member of the Syrian parliament for the session, as a representative of artists.\n\nWhen he performs, Fakhri insists on interacting with his audience. Before singing, he insists on having a good atmosphere by having good musicians and an appropriate sound system. While performing he asks for the lights to remain on, to interact with the audience. He says that the audience plays a key role in bringing out the performer's creativity. The audience should be aware of the music and poetry, so they would value the music given to them.\nFakhri has sung many traditional songs from Aleppo, based on the poems of Abu Firas al-Hamdani, Al-Mutanabbi and other poets. He has also worked with contemporary composers. Some of his most popular songs are:\n\nFakhri was awarded the Syrian Order of Merit of Excellent Degree by the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in recognition of his achievements in serving and his role in reviving the artistic heritage of Syria.\n\n\n"}

A spiral configuration of the shell is found in of numerous gastropods, but it is also found in shelled cephalopods including \"Nautilus\", \"Spirula\" and the large extinct subclass of cephalopods known as the ammonites. \n\nA spiral shell can be visualized as consisting of a long conical tube, the growth of which is coiled into an overall helical or planispiral shape, for reasons of both strength and compactness.\n\nThe number of whorls which exist in an adult shell of a particular species depends on mathematical factors in the geometric growth, as described in D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's classic 1917 book \"On Growth and Form\", and by David Raup. The main factor is how rapidly the conical tube expands (or flares-out) over time. When the rate of expansion is low, such that each subsequent whorl is not that much wider than the previous one, then the adult shell has numerous whorls. When the mathematical factors governing the pattern of growth are such that there is a very rapid expansion of the conical shape, of the shell tube, then the adult shell has very few whorls.\n\nThe number of whorls present in an adult shell differs greatly in various taxa. The extant marine gastropod families Turritellidae and Terebridae, and the extinct Mesozoic family Nerineidae, have very high spired shells with a large number of whorls, and a relatively small aperture.\n\nThe shells of a few genera of gastropods, and of the cephalopod genus \"Spirula\", have whorls that are disconnected.\n\nTo count exactly the number of whorls in gastropods a straight line is drawn to separate the semi-circular nucleus (protoconch (1 - see image) from the younger part of the shell. An arrow placed at a 90° angle on this line, following the course of the whorl, reaches the end of the first whorl where it is parallel to its starting position. From that point all whorls are counted towards the margin of the shell, estimating the ultimate whorl with an accuracy of a quarter whorl.\n\nOther authors (Ehrmann 1933; Richter & Seapy 1999) applied a slightly different measuring method, resulting in whorl numbers being a quarter higher.\n\n\nThis article incorporates CC-BY-3.0 text from the reference.\n"}
{"id": "1933931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1933931", "title": "History of American football", "text": "History of American football\n\nThe history of American football can be traced to early versions of rugby football and association football. Both games have their origin in multiple varieties of football played in Britain in the mid-19th century, in which a football is kicked at a goal or kicked over a line, which in turn were based on the varieties of English public school football games.\n\nAmerican football resulted from several major divergences from association football and rugby football, most notably the rule changes instituted by Walter Camp, a Yale University and Hopkins School graduate who is considered to be the \"Father of American Football\". Among these important changes were the introduction of the line of scrimmage, of down-and-distance rules and of the legalization of blocking. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, gameplay developments by college coaches such as Eddie Cochems, Amos Alonzo Stagg, Parke H. Davis, Knute Rockne, and Glenn \"Pop\" Warner helped take advantage of the newly introduced forward pass. The popularity of college football grew as it became the dominant version of the sport in the United States for the first half of the 20th century. Bowl games, a college football tradition, attracted a national audience for college teams. Boosted by fierce rivalries and colorful traditions, college football still holds widespread appeal in the United States.\n\nThe origin of professional football can be traced back to 1892, with Pudge Heffelfinger's $500 contract to play in a game for the Allegheny Athletic Association against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. In 1920 the American Professional Football Association was formed. This league changed its name to the National Football League (NFL) two years later, and eventually became the major league of American football. Primarily a sport of Midwestern industrial towns in the United States, professional football eventually became a national phenomenon.\n\nThe modern era of American football can be considered to have begun after the 1932 NFL Playoff game, which was the first indoor game since 1902 and the first American football game to feature hash marks, forward passes anywhere behind the line of scrimmage, and the movement of the goal posts back to the goal line. Other innovations to occur immediately after 1932 were the introduction of the AP Poll in 1934, the tapering of the ends of the football in 1934, the awarding of the first Heisman Trophy in 1935, the first NFL draft in 1936 and the first televised game in 1939. Another important event was the American football game at the 1932 Summer Olympics, which combined with a similar demonstration game at 1933 World's Fair, led to the first College All-Star Game in 1934, which in turn was an important factor in the growth of professional football in the United States. American football's explosion in popularity during the second half of the 20th century can be traced to the 1958 NFL Championship Game, a contest that has been dubbed the \"Greatest Game Ever Played\". A rival league to the NFL, the American Football League (AFL), began play in 1960; the pressure it put on the senior league led to a merger between the two leagues and the creation of the Super Bowl, which has become the most watched television event in the United States on an annual basis.\n\nIn Ancient Greece, men played a similar sport called Episkyros where they tried to throw a ball over a scrimmage while avoiding tackles.\n\nForms of traditional football maybe have been played throughout Europe and beyond since antiquity. Many of these may have involved handling of the ball, and scrummage-like formations. These archaic forms of football, typically classified as mob football, could be played between neighboring towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams, who could clash in a heaving mass of people struggling to drag an inflated pig's bladder by any means possible to markers at each end of a town. By some accounts, in some such events any means could be used to move the ball towards the goal, as long as it did not lead to manslaughter or murder. These antiquated games went into sharp decline in the 19th century when the Highway Act 1835 was passed banning the playing of football on public highways.\n\nAlthough there are some mentions of Native Americans playing football-like games, modern American football has its origins in the traditional football games played in the cities, villages and schools of Europe for many centuries before America was settled by Europeans. Early games appear to have had much in common with the traditional \"mob football\" played in England. The games remained largely unorganized until the 19th century, when intramural games of football began to be played. Organized varieties of football began to take form in 19th century in English public schools. According to legend, William Webb Ellis picked up the ball and ran with it during a school football match in 1823, thus creating a new style of play in which running with the ball predominated instead of kicking. Football soon began to be played at colleges and universities in the United States. Each school played its own variety of football. Princeton University students played a game called \"ballown\" as early as 1820. A Harvard tradition known as \"Bloody Monday\" began in 1827, which consisted of a mass ballgame between the freshman and sophomore classes, played at The Delta, the space where Memorial Hall now stands. (A poem, \"The Battle of the Delta,\" was written about the first match: \"The Freshmen’s wrath, to Sophs the direful spring / Of shins unnumbered bruised, great goddess sing!\") In 1860, both the town police and the college authorities agreed that Bloody Monday had to go. The Harvard students responded by going into mourning for a mock figure called \"Football Fightum\", for whom they conducted funeral rites. The authorities held firm and it was a dozen years before football was once again played at Harvard. Dartmouth played its own version called \"Old division football\", the rules of which were first published in 1871, though the game dates to at least the 1830s. All of these games, and others, shared certain commonalities. They remained largely \"mob\" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary. Rules were simple, and violence and injury were common. The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them. Yale, under pressure from the city of New Haven, banned the play of all forms of football in 1860.\n\nThe game began to return to college campuses by the late 1860s. Yale, Princeton, Rutgers University, and Brown University began playing the popular \"kicking\" game during this time. In 1867, Princeton used rules based on those of the London Football Association. A \"running game\", resembling rugby football, was taken up by the Montreal Football Club in Canada in 1868.\n\nOn November 6, 1869, Rutgers University faced Princeton University (then known as the College of New Jersey) in a game that was played with a round ball and used a set of rules suggested by Rutgers captain William J. Leggett, based on the Football Association's first set of rules, which were an early attempt by the former pupils of England's public schools to unify the rules of their public schools games and create a universal and standardized set of rules for the game of football and bore little resemblance to the American game which would be developed in the following decades. It is still usually regarded as the first game of intercollegiate American football. The game was played at a Rutgers field. Two teams of 25 players attempted to score by kicking the ball into the opposing team's goal. Throwing or carrying the ball was not allowed, but there was plenty of physical contact between players. The first team to reach six goals was declared the winner. Rutgers won by a score of six to four. A rematch was played at Princeton a week later under Princeton's own set of rules (one notable difference was the awarding of a \"free kick\" to any player that caught the ball on the fly, which was a feature adopted from the Football Association's rules; the fair catch kick rule has survived through to modern American game). Princeton won that game by a score of 8–0. Columbia joined the series in 1870, and by 1872 several schools were fielding intercollegiate teams, including Yale and Stevens Institute of Technology.\n\nRutgers was first to extend the reach of the game. An intercollegiate game was first played in the state of New York when Rutgers played Columbia on November 2, 1872. It was also the first scoreless tie in the history of the fledgling sport. Yale football started the same year and had its first match against Columbia, the nearest college to play football. It took place at Hamilton Park in New Haven and was the first game in New England. The game used a set of rules based on association football with 20-man sides, played on a field 400 by 250 feet. Yale won 3–0, Tommy Sherman scoring the first goal and Lew Irwin the other two.\n\nBy 1873, the college students playing football had made significant efforts to standardize their fledgling game. Teams had been scaled down from 25 players to 20. The only way to score was still to bat or kick the ball through the opposing team's goal, and the game was played in two 45 minute halves on fields 140 yards long and 70 yards wide. On October 20, 1873, representatives from Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and Rutgers met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City to codify the first set of intercollegiate football rules. Before this meeting, each school had its own set of rules and games were usually played using the home team's own particular code. At this meeting, a list of rules, based more on the Football Association's rules than the rules of the recently founded Rugby Football Union, was drawn up for intercollegiate football games.\nHarvard refused to attend the rules conference organized by the other schools and continued to play under its own code. While Harvard's decision to maintain its code made it hard for them to schedule games against other American universities, it agreed to play McGill University, from Montreal, in a two-game series in 1874. Harvard won the first game, in which its rules were used, 3–0. The second game, which was played under rugby regulations, did not have a winner as neither team managed to score.\n\nHarvard quickly took a liking to the rugby game, and its use of the try which, until that time, was not used in American football. The try would later evolve into the score known as the touchdown. On June 4, 1875, Harvard faced Tufts University in the first game between two American colleges played under rules similar to the McGill/Harvard contest, which was won by Tufts. The rules included each side fielding 11 men at any given time, the ball was advanced by kicking or carrying it, and tackles of the ball carrier stopped play. Further elated by the excitement of McGill's version of football, Harvard challenged its closest rival, Yale, to which the Bulldogs accepted. The two teams agreed to play under a set of rules called the \"Concessionary Rules\", which involved Harvard conceding something to Yale's soccer and Yale conceding a great deal to Harvard's rugby. They decided to play with 15 players on each team. On November 13, 1875, Yale and Harvard played each other for the first time ever, where Harvard won 4–0. At the first The Game—the annual contest between Harvard and Yale, among the 2000 spectators attending the game that day, was the future \"father of American football\" Walter Camp. Walter, who would enroll at Yale the next year, was torn between an admiration for Harvard's style of play and the misery of the Yale defeat and became determined to avenge Yale's defeat. Spectators from Princeton admired this type of game and it became the most popular version of football there.\n\nWalter Camp is widely considered to be the most important figure in the development of American football. As a youth, he excelled in sports like track, baseball, and association football, and after enrolling at Yale in 1876, he earned varsity honors in every sport the school offered.\n\nFollowing the introduction of rugby-style rules to American football, Camp became a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where rules were debated and changed. Dissatisfied with what seemed to him to be a disorganized mob, he proposed his first rule change at the first meeting he attended in 1878: a reduction from fifteen players to eleven. The motion was rejected at that time but passed in 1880. The effect was to open up the game and emphasize speed over strength. Camp's most famous change, the establishment of the line of scrimmage and the snap from center to quarterback, was also passed in 1880. Originally, the snap was executed with the foot of the center. Later changes made it possible to snap the ball with the hands, either through the air or by a direct hand-to-hand pass.\n\nCamp's new scrimmage rules revolutionized the game, though not always as intended. Princeton, in particular, used scrimmage play to slow the game, making incremental progress towards the end zone during each down. Rather than increase scoring, which had been Camp's original intent, the rule was exploited to maintain control of the ball for the entire game, resulting in slow, unexciting contests. At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three downs. These down-and-distance rules, combined with the establishment of the line of scrimmage, transformed the game from a variation of rugby football into the distinct sport of American football.\n\nCamp was central to several more significant rule changes that came to define American football. In 1881, the field was reduced in size to its modern dimensions of 120 by 53 yards (109.7 by 48.8 meters). Several times in 1883, Camp tinkered with the scoring rules, finally arriving at four points for a touchdown, two points for kicks after touchdowns, two points for safeties, and five for field goals. Camp's innovations in the area of point scoring influenced rugby union's move to point scoring in 1890. In 1887, game time was set at two halves of 45 minutes each. Also in 1887, two paid officials—a referee and an umpire—were mandated for each game. A year later, the rules were changed to allow tackling below the waist, and in 1889, the officials were given whistles and stopwatches.\n\nThe last, and arguably most important innovation, which would at last make American football uniquely \"American\", was the legalization of interference, or blocking, a tactic which was highly illegal under the rugby-style rules. Interference remains strictly illegal in both rugby codes. The prohibition of interference in the rugby game stems from the game's strict enforcement of its offside rule, which prohibited any player on the team with possession of the ball to loiter between the ball and the goal. At first, American players would find creative ways of aiding the runner by pretending to accidentally knock into defenders trying to tackle the runner. When Walter Camp witnessed this tactic being employed against his Yale team, he was at first appalled, but the next year had adopted the blocking tactics for his own team. During the 1880s and 1890s, teams developed increasingly complex blocking tactics including the interlocking interference technique known as the Flying wedge or \"V-trick formation\", which was developed by Lorin F. Deland and first introduced by Harvard in a collegiate game against Yale in 1892. Despite its effectiveness, it was outlawed two seasons later in 1894 through the efforts of the rule committee led by Parke H. Davis, because of its contribution to serious injury.\n\nAfter his playing career at Yale ended in 1882, Camp was employed by the New Haven Clock Company until his death in 1925. Though no longer a player, he remained a fixture at annual rules meetings for most of his life, and he personally selected an annual All-American team every year from 1889 through 1924. The Walter Camp Football Foundation continues to select All-American teams in his honor.\n\nOn November 23, 1876, representatives from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia met at the Massasoit House in Springfield, Massachusetts to standardize a new code of rules based on the rugby game first introduced to Harvard by McGill University in 1874. The rules were based largely on the Rugby Football Union's code from England, though one important difference was the replacement of a kicked goal with a touchdown as the primary means of scoring (a change that would later occur in rugby itself, favoring the try as the main scoring event). Three of the schools—Harvard, Columbia, and Princeton—formed the Intercollegiate Football Association, as a result of the meeting. Yale did not join the group until 1879, because of an early disagreement about the number of players per team.\nThe first game where one team scored over 100 points happened on October 25, 1884 when Yale routed Dartmouth 113–0. It was also the first time one team scored over 100 points and the opposing team was shut out. The next week, Princeton outscored Lafayette by 140 to 0.\n\nIn 1879, the University of Michigan became the first school west of Pennsylvania to establish a college football team. On May 30, 1879 Michigan beat Racine College 1–0 in a game played in Chicago. The \"Chicago Daily Tribune\" called it \"the first rugby-football game to be played west of the Alleghenies.\" Other Midwestern schools soon followed suit, including the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, and the University of Minnesota. The first western team to travel east was the 1881 Michigan team, which played at Harvard, Yale and Princeton. The nation's first college football league, the Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives (also known as the Western Conference), a precursor to the Big Ten Conference, was founded in 1895.\n\nOn April 9, 1880 at Stoll Field, Transylvania University (then called Kentucky University) beat Centre College by the score of 13¾–0 in what is often considered the first recorded game played in the South. The first game of \"scientific football\" in the South was the first instance of the Victory Bell rivalry between North Carolina and Duke (then known as Trinity College) held on Thanksgiving Day, 1888, at the North Carolina State Fairgrounds in Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nOn November 13, 1887 the Virginia Cavaliers and Pantops Academy fought to a scoreless tie in the first organized football game in the state of Virginia. Students at UVA were playing pickup games of the kicking-style of football as early as 1870, and some accounts even claim that some industrious ones organized a game against Washington and Lee College in 1871, just two years after Rutgers and Princeton's historic first game in 1869. But no record has been found of the score of this contest. Washington and Lee also claims a 4 to 2 win over VMI in 1873. Washington and Lee won 4–2. Some industrious students of the two schools organized a game for October 23, 1869 – but it was rained out.\n\nCollege football expanded greatly during the last two decades of the 19th century. Several major rivalries date from this time period.\nNovember 1890 was an active time in the sport. In Baldwin City, Kansas, on November 22, 1890, college football was first played in the state of Kansas. Baker beat Kansas 22–9. On the 27th, Vanderbilt played Nashville (Peabody) at Athletic Park and won 40–0. It was the first time organized football played in the state of Tennessee. The 29th also saw the first instance of the Army–Navy Game. Navy won 24–0.\n\nThe first nighttime football game was played in Mansfield, Pennsylvania on September 28, 1892 between Mansfield State Normal and Wyoming Seminary and ended at halftime in a 0–0 tie. The Army-Navy game of 1893 saw the first documented use of a football helmet by a player in a game. Joseph M. Reeves had a crude leather helmet made by a shoemaker in Annapolis and wore it in the game after being warned by his doctor that he risked death if he continued to play football after suffering an earlier kick to the head.\n\nThe beginnings of the contemporary Southeastern Conference and Atlantic Coast Conference started in 1892. Upon organizing the first Auburn football team in that year, George Petrie arranged for the team to play the University of Georgia team at Piedmont Park in Atlanta, Georgia. Auburn won the game, 10–0, in front of 2,000 spectators. The game inaugurated what is known to college football fans as the Deep South's Oldest Rivalry. It was in 1894 the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) was founded on December 21, 1894, by Dr. William Dudley, a chemistry professor at Vanderbilt. The original members were Alabama, Auburn, Georgia, Georgia Tech, North Carolina, , and Vanderbilt. Clemson, Cumberland, Kentucky, LSU, Mercer, Mississippi, Mississippi A&M (Mississippi State), Southwestern Presbyterian University, Tennessee, Texas, Tulane, and the University of Nashville joined the following year in 1895 as invited charter members. The conference was originally formed for \"the development and purification of college athletics throughout the South\".\n\nIt is thought that the first forward pass in football occurred on October 26, 1895 in a game between Georgia and North Carolina when, out of desperation, the ball was thrown by the North Carolina back Joel Whitaker instead of punted and George Stephens caught the ball. On November 9, 1895 John Heisman executed a hidden ball trick utilizing quarterback Reynolds Tichenor to get Auburn's only touchdown in a 6 to 9 loss to Vanderbilt. It was the first game in the south decided by a field goal. Heisman later used the trick against Pop Warner's Georgia team. Warner picked up the trick and later used it at Cornell against Penn State in 1897. He then used it in 1903 at Carlisle against Harvard and garnered national attention, the play was soon made illegal. \nThe 1899 Sewanee Tigers are one of the all-time great teams of the early sport. The team went 12–0, outscoring opponents 322 to 10. Known as the \"Iron Men\", with just 13 men they had a six-day road trip with five shutout wins over Texas A&M; Texas; Tulane; LSU; and Ole Miss. It is recalled memorably with the phrase \"... and on the seventh day they rested.\" Grantland Rice called them \"the most durable football team I ever saw.\"\n\nThe first college football game in Oklahoma Territory occurred on November 7, 1895 when the 'Oklahoma City Terrors' defeated the Oklahoma Sooners 34 to 0. The Terrors were a mix of Methodist college students and high schoolers. The Sooners did not manage a single first down. By next season, Oklahoma coach John A. Harts had left to prospect for gold in the Arctic. Organized football was first played in the territory on November 29, 1894 between the Oklahoma City Terrors and Oklahoma City High School. The high school won 24 to 0.\n\nIn 1891, the first Stanford football team was hastily organized and played a four-game season beginning in January 1892 with no official head coach. Following the season, Stanford captain John Whittemore wrote to Yale coach Walter Camp asking him to recommend a coach for Stanford. To Whittemore's surprise, Camp agreed to coach the team himself, on the condition that he finish the season at Yale first. As a result of Camp's late arrival, Stanford played just three official games, against San Francisco's Olympic Club and rival California. The team also played exhibition games against two Los Angeles area teams that Stanford does not include in official results. Camp returned to the East Coast following the season, but coached Stanford for two further years from 1894–1895.\n\nUSC first fielded an American football team in 1888. Playing its first game on November 14 of that year against the Alliance Athletic Club, in which USC gained a 16–0 victory. Frank Suffel and Henry H. Goddard were playing coaches for the first team which was put together by quarterback Arthur Carroll; who in turn volunteered to make the pants for the team and later became a tailor. USC faced its first collegiate opponent the following year in fall 1889, playing St. Vincent's College to a 40–0 victory. In 1893, USC joined the Intercollegiate Football Association of Southern California (the forerunner of the SCIAC), which was composed of USC, Occidental College, Throop Polytechnic Institute (Cal Tech), and Chaffey College. Pomona College was invited to enter, but declined to do so. An invitation was also extended to Los Angeles High School.\nThe Big Game between Stanford and California is the oldest college football rivalry in the West. The first game was played on San Francisco's Haight Street Grounds on March 19, 1892 with Stanford winning 14–10. The term \"Big Game\" was first used in 1900, when it was played on Thanksgiving Day in San Francisco. During that game, a large group of men and boys, who were observing from the roof of the nearby S.F. and Pacific Glass Works, fell into the fiery interior of the building when the roof collapsed, resulting in 13 dead and 78 injured. On December 4, 1900, the last victim of the disaster (Fred Lilly) died, bringing the death toll to 22; the \"Thanksgiving Day Disaster\" remains the deadliest accident to kill spectators at a U.S. sporting event.\nIn May 1900, Fielding H. Yost was hired as the football coach at Stanford University, and, after traveling home to West Virginia, he arrived in Palo Alto, California, on August 21, 1900. Yost led the 1900 Stanford team to a 7–2–1 record, outscoring opponents 154 to 20. The next year in 1901, Yost was hired by Charles A. Baird as the head football coach for the Michigan Wolverines football team. Led by Yost, Michigan became the first \"western\" national power. From 1901 to 1905, Michigan had a 56-game undefeated streak that included a 1902 trip to play in the first college football bowl game, which later became the Rose Bowl Game. During this streak, Michigan scored 2,831 points while allowing only 40.\n\nIn 1906, citing concerns about the violence in American Football, universities on the West Coast, led by California and Stanford, replaced the sport with rugby union. At the time, the future of American football was very much in doubt and these schools believed that rugby union would eventually be adopted nationwide. Other schools followed suit and also made the switch included Nevada, St. Mary's, Santa Clara, and USC (in 1911). However, due to the perception that West Coast football was inferior to the game played on the East Coast anyway, East Coast and Midwest teams shrugged off the loss of the teams and continued playing American football. With no nationwide movement, the available pool of rugby teams to play remained small. The schools scheduled games against local club teams and reached out to rugby union powers in Australia, New Zealand, and especially, due to its proximity, Canada. The annual Big Game between Stanford and California continued as rugby, with the winner invited by the British Columbia Rugby Union to a tournament in Vancouver over the Christmas holidays, with the winner of that tournament receiving the Cooper Keith Trophy.\n\nFrom its earliest days as a mob game, football was a very violent sport. The 1894 Harvard-Yale game, known as the \"Hampden Park Blood Bath\", resulted in crippling injuries for four players; the contest was suspended until 1897. The annual Army-Navy game was suspended from 1894 to 1898 for similar reasons. One of the major problems was the popularity of mass-formations like the flying wedge, in which a large number of offensive players charged as a unit against a similarly arranged defense. The resultant collisions often led to serious injuries and sometimes even death. Georgia fullback Richard Von Albade Gammon died on the field from a concussion received against Virginia in 1897, causing some southern universities to temporarily stop their football programs.\n\nIn 1905 there were 19 fatalities nationwide. President Theodore Roosevelt reportedly threatened to shut down the game if drastic changes were not made. However, though he lectured on eliminating and reducing injuries, and held a meeting of football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton on October 9, 1905, he never threatened to ban football. He lacked the authority to abolish the game and was actually a fan who wanted to preserve it. The President's sons were playing football at the college and secondary levels at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, John H. Outland held an experimental game in Wichita, Kansas that reduced the number of scrimmage plays to earn a first down from four to three in an attempt to reduce injuries. The \"Los Angeles Times\" reported an increase in punts and considered the game much safer than regular play but that the new rule was not \"conducive to the sport.\" Finally, on December 28, 1905, 62 schools met in New York City to discuss rule changes to make the game safer. As a result of this meeting, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, later named the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), was formed. One rule change introduced in 1906, devised to open up the game and reduce injury, was the introduction of the legal forward pass. Though it was underutilized for years, this proved to be one of the most important rule changes in the establishment of the modern game.\nAs a result of the 1905–1906 reforms, mass formation plays became illegal and forward passes legal. Bradbury Robinson, playing for visionary coach Eddie Cochems at St. Louis University, threw the first legal pass in a September 5, 1906, game against Carroll College at Waukesha. Other important changes, formally adopted in 1910, were the requirements that at least seven offensive players be on the line of scrimmage at the time of the snap, that there be no pushing or pulling, and that interlocking interference (arms linked or hands on belts and uniforms) was not allowed. These changes greatly reduced the potential for collision injuries. Several coaches emerged who took advantage of these sweeping changes. Amos Alonzo Stagg introduced such innovations as the huddle, the tackling dummy, and the pre-snap shift. Other coaches, such as Pop Warner and Knute Rockne, introduced new strategies that still remain part of the game.\n\nBesides these coaching innovations, several rules changes during the first third of the 20th century had a profound impact on the game, mostly in opening up the passing game. In 1914, the first roughing-the-passer penalty was implemented. In 1918, the rules on eligible receivers were loosened to allow eligible players to catch the ball anywhere on the field—previously strict rules were in place only allowing passes to certain areas of the field. Scoring rules also changed during this time: field goals were lowered to three points in 1909 and touchdowns raised to six points in 1912.\n\nStar players that emerged in the early 20th century include Jim Thorpe, Red Grange, and Bronko Nagurski; these three made the transition to the fledgling NFL and helped turn it into a successful league. Sportswriter Grantland Rice helped popularize the sport with his poetic descriptions of games and colorful nicknames for the game's biggest players, including Notre Dame's \"Four Horsemen\" backfield and Fordham University's linemen, known as the \"Seven Blocks of Granite\".\n\nIn 1907 at Champaign, Illinois Chicago and Illinois played in the first game to have a halftime show featuring a marching band. Chicago won 42–6. On November 25, 1911 Kansas and Missouri played the first homecoming football game. The game was \"broadcast\" play-by-play over telegraph to at least 1,000 fans in Lawrence, Kansas. It ended in a 3–3 tie. The game between West Virginia and Pittsburgh on October 8, 1921, saw the first live radio broadcast of a college football game when Harold W. Arlin announced that year's Backyard Brawl played at Forbes Field on KDKA. Pitt won 21–13. On October 28, 1922, Princeton and Chicago played the first game to be nationally broadcast on radio. Princeton won 21–18 in a hotly contested game which had Princeton dubbed the \"Team of Destiny.\"\n\nIn 1906 Vanderbilt defeated Carlisle 4–0, the result of a Bob Blake field goal. In 1907 Vanderbilt fought Navy to a 6–6 tie. In 1910 Vanderbilt held defending national champion Yale to a scoreless tie.\nHelping Georgia Tech's claim to a title in 1917, the Auburn Tigers held undefeated, Chic Harley led Big Ten champion Ohio State to a scoreless tie the week before Georgia Tech beat the Tigers 68–7. The next season, with many players gone due to World War I, a game was finally scheduled at Forbes Field with Pittsburgh. The Panthers, led by halfback Tom Davies, defeated Georgia Tech 32–0.\n\n1917 saw the rise of another Southern team in Centre of Danville, Kentucky. In 1921 Bo McMillin led Centre upset defending national champion Harvard 6–0 in what is widely considered one of the greatest upsets in college football history. The next year Vanderbilt fought Michigan to a scoreless tie at the inaugural game on Dudley Field, the first stadium in the South made exclusively for college football. Michigan coach Fielding Yost and Vanderbilt coach Dan McGugin were brothers-in-law, and the latter the protege of the former. The game featured the season's two best defenses and included a goal line stand by Vanderbilt to preserve the tie. Its result was \"a great surprise to the sporting world.\" Commodore fans celebrated by throwing some 3,000 seat cushions onto the field. The game features prominently in Vanderbilt's history. That same year, Alabama upset Penn 9–7.\n\nVanderbilt's line coach then was Wallace Wade, who in 1925 coached Alabama to the south's first Rose Bowl victory. This game is commonly referred to as \"the game that changed the south.\" Wade followed up the next season with an undefeated record and Rose Bowl tie.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the college game continued to grow, particularly in the South, bolstered by fierce rivalries such as the \"South's Oldest Rivalry\", between Virginia and North Carolina and the \"Deep South's Oldest Rivalry\", between Georgia and Auburn. Although before the mid-1920s most national powers came from the Northeast or the Midwest, the trend changed when several teams from the South and the West Coast achieved national success. Wallace William Wade's 1925 Alabama team won the 1926 Rose Bowl after receiving its first national title and William Alexander's 1928 Georgia Tech team defeated California in the 1929 Rose Bowl. College football quickly became the most popular spectator sport in the South.\n\nSeveral major modern college football conferences rose to prominence during this time period. The Southwest Athletic Conference had been founded in 1915. Consisting mostly of schools from Texas, the conference saw back-to-back national champions with Texas Christian University (TCU) in 1938 and Texas A&M in 1939. The Pacific Coast Conference (PCC), a precursor to the Pac-12 Conference (Pac-12), had its own back-to-back champion in the University of Southern California which was awarded the title in 1931 and 1932. The Southeastern Conference (SEC) formed in 1932 and consisted mostly of schools in the Deep South. As in previous decades, the Big Ten continued to dominate in the 1930s and 1940s, with Minnesota winning 5 titles between 1934 and 1941, and Michigan (1933, 1947, and 1948) and Ohio State (1942) also winning titles.\n\nAs it grew beyond its regional affiliations in the 1930s, college football garnered increased national attention. Four new bowl games were created: the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, the Sun Bowl in 1935, and the Cotton Bowl in 1937. In lieu of an actual national championship, these bowl games, along with the earlier Rose Bowl, provided a way to match up teams from distant regions of the country that did not otherwise play. In 1936, the Associated Press began its weekly poll of prominent sports writers, ranking all of the nation's college football teams. Since there was no national championship game, the final version of the AP poll was used to determine who was crowned the National Champion of college football.\n\nThe 1930s saw growth in the passing game. Though some coaches, such as General Robert Neyland at Tennessee, continued to eschew its use and was the last college team to produce an undefeated, untied and unscored upon season in 1939. Several rules changes to the game had a profound effect on teams' ability to throw the ball. In 1934, the rules committee removed two major penalties—a loss of five yards for a second incomplete pass in any series of downs and a loss of possession for an incomplete pass in the end zone—and shrunk the circumference of the ball, making it easier to grip and throw. Players who became famous for taking advantage of the easier passing game included Alabama end Don Hutson and TCU passer \"Slingin\" Sammy Baugh.\n\nIn 1935, New York City's Downtown Athletic Club awarded the first Heisman Trophy to University of Chicago halfback Jay Berwanger, who was also the first ever NFL Draft pick in 1936. The trophy was designed by sculptor Frank Eliscu and modeled after New York University player Ed Smith. The trophy recognizes the nation's \"most outstanding\" college football player and has become one of the most coveted awards in all of American sports.\n\nDuring World War II, college football players enlisted in the armed forces, some playing in Europe during the war. As most of these players had eligibility left on their college careers, some of them returned to college at West Point, bringing Army back-to-back national titles in 1944 and 1945 under coach Red Blaik. Doc Blanchard (known as \"Mr. Inside\") and Glenn Davis (known as \"Mr. Outside\") both won the Heisman Trophy, in 1945 and 1946 respectively. On the coaching staff of those 1944–1946 Army teams was future Pro Football Hall of Fame coach Vince Lombardi.\n\nThe 1950s saw the rise of yet more dynasties and power programs. Oklahoma, under coach Bud Wilkinson, won three national titles (1950, 1955, 1956) and all ten Big Eight Conference championships in the decade while building a record 47-game winning streak. Woody Hayes led Ohio State to two national titles, in 1954 and 1957, and dominated the Big Ten conference, winning three Big Ten titles—more than any other school. Wilkinson and Hayes, along with Robert Neyland of Tennessee, oversaw a revival of the running game in the 1950s. Passing numbers dropped from an average of 18.9 attempts in 1951 to 13.6 attempts in 1955, while teams averaged just shy of 50 running plays per game. Nine out of ten Heisman trophy winners in the 1950s were runners. Notre Dame, one of the biggest passing teams of the decade, saw a substantial decline in success; the 1950s were the only decade between 1920 and 1990 when the team did not win at least a share of the national title. Paul Hornung, Notre Dame quarterback, did, however, win the Heisman in 1956, becoming the only player from a losing team ever to do so.\n\nFollowing the enormous success of the National Football League's 1958 championship game, college football no longer enjoyed the same popularity as the NFL, at least on a national level. While both games benefited from the advent of television, since the late 1950s, the NFL has become a nationally popular sport while college football has maintained strong regional ties.\nAs professional football became a national television phenomenon, college football did as well. In the 1950s, Notre Dame, which had a large national following, formed its own network to broadcast its games, but by and large the sport still retained a mostly regional following. In 1952, the NCAA claimed all television broadcasting rights for the games of its member institutions, and it alone negotiated television rights. This situation continued until 1984, when several schools brought a suit under the Sherman Antitrust Act; the Supreme Court ruled against the NCAA and schools are now free to negotiate their own television deals. ABC Sports began broadcasting a national Game of the Week in 1966, bringing key matchups and rivalries to a national audience for the first time.\n\nNew formations and play sets continued to be developed. Emory Bellard, an assistant coach under Darrell Royal at the University of Texas, developed a three-back option style offense known as the wishbone. The wishbone is a run-heavy offense that depends on the quarterback making last second decisions on when and to whom to hand or pitch the ball to. Royal went on to teach the offense to other coaches, including Bear Bryant at Alabama, Chuck Fairbanks at Oklahoma and Pepper Rodgers at UCLA; who all adapted and developed it to their own tastes. The strategic opposite of the wishbone is the spread offense, developed by professional and college coaches throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Though some schools play a run-based version of the spread, its most common use is as a passing offense designed to \"spread\" the field both horizontally and vertically. Some teams have managed to adapt with the times to keep winning consistently. In the rankings of the most victorious programs, Michigan, Notre Dame, and Texas are ranked first, second, and third in total wins.\n\nIn 1940, for the highest level of college football, there were only five bowl games (Rose, Orange, Sugar, Sun, and Cotton). By 1950, three more had joined that number and in 1970, there were still only eight major college bowl games. The number grew to eleven in 1976. At the birth of cable television and cable sports networks like ESPN, there were fifteen bowls in 1980. With more national venues and increased available revenue, the bowls saw an explosive growth throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In the thirty years from 1950 to 1980, seven bowl games were added to the schedule. From 1980 to 2010, an additional 20 bowl games were added to the schedule. Some have criticized this growth, claiming that the increased number of games has diluted the significance of playing in a bowl game. Yet others have countered that the increased number of games has increased exposure and revenue for a greater number of schools, and see it as a positive development.\n\nWith the growth of bowl games, it became difficult to determine a national champion in a fair and equitable manner. As conferences became contractually bound to certain bowl games (a situation known as a tie-in), match-ups that guaranteed a consensus national champion became increasingly rare. In 1992, seven conferences and independent Notre Dame formed the Bowl Coalition, which attempted to arrange an annual No.1 versus No.2 matchup based on the final AP poll standings. The Coalition lasted for three years; however, several scheduling issues prevented much success; tie-ins still took precedence in several cases. For example, the Big Eight and SEC champions could never meet, since they were contractually bound to different bowl games. The coalition also excluded the Rose Bowl, arguably the most prestigious game in the nation, and two major conferences—the Pac-10 and Big Ten—meaning that it had limited success. In 1995, the Coalition was replaced by the Bowl Alliance, which reduced the number of bowl games to host a national championship game to three—the Fiesta, Sugar, and Orange Bowls—and the participating conferences to five—the ACC, SEC, Southwest, Big Eight, and Big East. It was agreed that the No.1 and No.2 ranked teams gave up their prior bowl tie-ins and were guaranteed to meet in the national championship game, which rotated between the three participating bowls. The system still did not include the Big Ten, Pac-10, or the Rose Bowl, and thus still lacked the legitimacy of a true national championship.\n\nIn 1998, a new system was put into place called the Bowl Championship Series. For the first time, it included all major conferences (ACC, Big East, Big 12, Big Ten, Pac-10, and SEC) and all four major bowl games (Rose, Orange, Sugar and Fiesta). The champions of these six conferences, along with two \"at-large\" selections, were invited to play in the four bowl games. Each year, one of the four bowl games served as a national championship game. Also, a complex system of human polls, computer rankings, and strength of schedule calculations was instituted to rank schools. Based on this ranking system, the No.1 and No.2 teams met each year in the national championship game. Traditional tie-ins were maintained for schools and bowls not part of the national championship. For example, in years when not a part of the national championship, the Rose Bowl still hosted the Big Ten and Pac-10 champions.\n\nThe system continued to change, as the formula for ranking teams was tweaked from year to year. At-large teams could be chosen from any of the Division I conferences, though only one selection—Utah in 2005—came from a BCS non-AQ conference. Starting with the 2006 season, a fifth game—simply called the BCS National Championship Game—was added to the schedule, to be played at the site of one of the four BCS bowl games on a rotating basis, one week after the regular bowl game. This opened up the BCS to two additional at-large teams. Also, rules were changed to add the champions of five additional conferences (Conference USA, the Mid-American Conference, the Mountain West Conference, the Sun Belt Conference and the Western Athletic Conference), provided that said champion ranked in the top twelve in the final BCS rankings, or was within the top 16 of the BCS rankings and ranked higher than the champion of at least one of the \"BCS conferences\" (also known as \"AQ\" conferences, for Automatic Qualifying). Several times after this rule change was implemented, schools from non-AQ conferences played in BCS bowl games, most notably Boise State in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl, in which they upset Oklahoma in overtime. In 2009, Boise State played TCU in the Fiesta Bowl, the first time two schools from BCS non-AQ conferences played each other in a BCS bowl game. The last team from the non-AQ ranks to reach a BCS bowl game was Northern Illinois in 2012, which played in (and lost) the 2013 Orange Bowl.\n\nDue to the intensification of the college football playoff debate after nearly a decade of the sometimes disputable results of the BCS, the conference commissioners and Notre Dame's president voted to implement a Plus-One system which was to be called the 'College Football Playoff'. The College Football Playoff is the annual postseason tournament for the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and just as its predecessors, has failed to receive sanctioning from the NCAA. The playoff began with the 2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season. Four teams play in two semifinal games, and the winners advance to the College Football Playoff National Championship game. The first season of the new system was not without controversy, however, after TCU and Baylor (both with only one loss) both failed to receive the support of the College Football Playoff selection committee. After the first season, the playoff has been dominated by two teams, Alabama and Clemson; one of the two has won every playoff except the first, and in three of the five years of the playoff, they have played each other in the championship game; in one other year they met in the semifinals.\n\nIn the early 20th century, football began to catch on in the general population of the United States and was the subject of intense competition and rivalry, albeit of a localized nature. Although payments to players were considered unsporting and dishonorable at the time, a Pittsburgh area club, the Allegheny Athletic Association, of the unofficial western Pennsylvania football circuit, surreptitiously hired former Yale All-American guard Pudge Heffelfinger. On November 12, 1892, Heffelfinger became the first known professional football player. He was paid $500 to play in a game against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. Heffelfinger picked up a Pittsburgh fumble and ran 35 yards for a touchdown, winning the game 4–0 for Allegheny. Although observers held suspicions, the payment remained a secret for years.\n\nOn September 3, 1895 the first wholly professional game was played, in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, between the Latrobe Athletic Association and the Jeannette Athletic Club. Latrobe won the contest 12–0. During this game, Latrobe's quarterback, John Brallier became the first player to openly admit to being paid to play football. He was paid $10 plus expenses to play. In 1897, the Latrobe Athletic Association paid all of its players for the whole season, becoming the first fully professional football team. In 1898, William Chase Temple took over the team payments for the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club, a professional football team based in Pittsburgh from 1895 until 1900, becoming the first known individual football club owner. Later that year, the Morgan Athletic Club, on the South Side of Chicago, was founded. This team later became the Chicago Cardinals, then the St. Louis Cardinals and now is known as the Arizona Cardinals, making them the oldest continuously operating professional football team.\n\nThe first known professional football league, known as the National Football League (not the same as the modern league) began play in 1902 when several baseball clubs formed football teams to play in the league, including the Philadelphia Athletics, Pittsburgh Pirates and the Philadelphia Phillies. The Pirates' team the Pittsburgh Stars were awarded the league championship. However, the Philadelphia Football Athletics and Philadelphia Football Phillies also claimed the title. A five-team tournament, known as the World Series of Football was organized by Tom O'Rouke, the manager of Madison Square Garden. The event featured the first-ever indoor pro football games. The first professional indoor game came on December 29, 1902, when the Syracuse Athletic Club defeated the \"New York team\" 5–0. Syracuse would go on to win the 1902 Series, while the Franklin Athletic Club won the Series in 1903. The World Series only lasted two seasons.\n\nThe first black person to be paid for his play in football games is thought to be two-sport athlete Charles Follis, A member of the Shelby Steamfitters for five years starting in 1902, Follis turned professional in 1904.\n\nThe game moved west into Ohio, which became the center of professional football during the early decades of the 20th century. Small towns such as Massillon, Akron, Portsmouth, and Canton all supported professional teams in a loose coalition known as the \"Ohio League\", the direct predecessor to today's National Football League. In 1906 the Canton Bulldogs–Massillon Tigers betting scandal became the first major scandal in professional football in the United States. It was the first known case of professional gamblers attempting to fix a professional sport. Although the Massillon Tigers could not prove that the Canton Bulldogs had thrown the second game, the scandal tarnished the Bulldogs' name and helped ruin professional football in Ohio until the mid-1910s.\n\nIn 1915, the reformed Canton Bulldogs signed former Olympian and Carlisle Indian School standout Jim Thorpe to a contract. Thorpe became the face of professional football for the next several years and was present at the founding of the National Football League five years later.\n\nIn 1920, the American Professional Football Association (APFA) was founded, in a meeting at a Hupmobile car dealership in Canton, Ohio. Jim Thorpe was elected the league's first president. After several more meetings, the league's membership was formalized. The original teams were:\n\nIn its early years the league was little more than a formal agreement between teams to play each other and to declare a champion at season's end. Teams were still permitted to play non-league members. The 1920 season saw several teams drop out and fail to play through their schedule. Only four teams: Akron, Buffalo, Canton, and Decatur, finished the schedule. Akron claimed the first league champion, with the only undefeated record among the remaining teams.\n\nThe APFA, which later became known as the National Football League (NFL), had a limited number of black players. In the league's first seven years, nine African-Americans played in the APFA/NFL. Two black players took part in the league's inaugural season: Fritz Pollard and Bobby Marshall. In 1921, Pollard coached in the league, becoming the first African-American to do so.\n\nIn 1921, several more teams joined the league, increasing the membership to 22 teams. Among the new additions were the Green Bay Packers, which now has the record for longest use of an unchanged team name. Also in 1921, A. E. Staley, the owner of the Decatur Staleys, sold the team to player-coach George Halas, who went on to become one of the most important figures in the first half century of the NFL. In 1921, Halas moved the team to Chicago, but retained the Staleys nickname. In 1922 the team was renamed the Chicago Bears. The Staleys won the 1921 AFPA Championship, over the Buffalo All-Americans in an event later referred to as the \"Staley Swindle\".\n\nBy the mid-1920s, NFL membership had grown to 25 teams, and a rival league known as the American Football League was formed. The rival AFL folded after a single season, but it symbolized a growing interest in the professional game. Several college stars joined the NFL, most notably Red Grange from the University of Illinois, who was taken on a famous barnstorming tour in 1925 by the Chicago Bears. Another scandal that season centered on a 1925 game between the Chicago Cardinals and the Milwaukee Badgers. The scandal involved a Chicago player, Art Folz, hiring a group of high school football players to play for the Milwaukee Badgers, against the Cardinals. This would ensure an inferior opponent for Chicago. The game was used to help prop up their win-loss percentage and as a chance of wrestling away the 1925 Championship away from the first place Pottsville Maroons. All parties were severely punished initially; however, a few months later the punishments were rescinded. Also that year a controversial dispute stripped the NFL title from the Maroons and awarded it to the Cardinals.\n\nAt the end of the 1932 season, the Chicago Bears and the Portsmouth Spartans were tied with the best regular-season records. To determine the champion, the league voted to hold its first playoff game. Because of cold weather, the game was held indoors at Chicago Stadium, which forced some temporary rule changes. Chicago won, 9–0. The playoff proved so popular that the league reorganized into two divisions for the 1933 season, with the winners advancing to a scheduled championship game. A number of new rule changes were also instituted: the goal posts were moved forward to the goal line, every play started from between the hash marks, and forward passes could originate from anywhere behind the line of scrimmage (instead of the previous five yards behind). In 1936, the NFL instituted the first draft of college players. With the first ever draft selection, the Philadelphia Eagles picked Heisman Trophy winner Jay Berwanger, but he declined to play professionally. Also in that year, another AFL formed, but it also lasted only two seasons.\n\nThe 1930s represented an important time of transition for the NFL. League membership was fluid prior to the mid-1930s. In 1933, the Pittsburgh Steelers and Philadelphia Eagles were founded. 1936 was the first year where there were no franchise moves, prior to that year 51 teams had gone defunct. In 1941, the NFL named its first Commissioner, Elmer Layden. The new office replaced that of President. Layden held the job for five years, before being replaced by Philadelphia Eagles co-owner Bert Bell in 1946.\n\nDuring World War II, a player shortage led to a shrinking of the league as several teams folded and others merged. Among the short-lived merged teams were the Steagles (Pittsburgh and Philadelphia) in 1943, the Card-Pitts (Chicago Cardinals and Pittsburgh) in 1944, and a team formed from the merger of the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Boston Yanks in 1945.\n\n1946 was an important year in the history of professional football, as that was the year when the league reintegrated. The Los Angeles Rams signed two African American players, Kenny Washington and Woody Strode. Also that year, a competing league, the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), began operation.\n\nDuring the 1950s, additional teams entered the league. In 1950, the AAFC folded, and three teams from that league were absorbed into the NFL: the Cleveland Browns (who had won the AAFC Championship every year of the league's existence), the San Francisco 49ers, and the Baltimore Colts (not the same as the modern franchise, this version folded after one year). The remaining players were chosen by the now 13 NFL teams in a dispersal draft. Also in 1950, the Los Angeles Rams became the first team to televise its entire schedule, marking the beginning of an important relationship between television and professional football. In 1952, the Dallas Texans went defunct, becoming the last NFL franchise to do so. The following year a new Baltimore Colts franchise formed to take over the assets of the Texans. The players' union, known as the NFL Players Association, formed in 1956.\n\nAt the conclusion of the 1958 NFL season, the Baltimore Colts and the New York Giants met at Yankee Stadium to determine the league champion. Tied after 60 minutes of play, it became the first NFL game to go into sudden death overtime. The final score was Colts 23, Giants 17. The game has since become widely known as \"the Greatest Game Ever Played\". It was carried live on the NBC television network, and the national exposure it provided the league has been cited as a watershed moment in professional football history, helping propel the NFL to become one of the most popular sports leagues in the United States. Journalist Tex Maule said of the contest, \"This, for the first time, was a truly epic game which inflamed the imagination of a national audience.\"\n\nIn 1959, longtime NFL commissioner Bert Bell died of a heart attack while attending an Eagles/Steelers game at Franklin Field. That same year, Dallas businessman Lamar Hunt led the formation of the rival American Football League, the fourth such league to bear that name, with war hero and former South Dakota Governor Joe Foss as its Commissioner. Unlike the earlier rival leagues, and bolstered by television exposure, the AFL posed a significant threat to NFL dominance of the professional football world. With the exception of Los Angeles and New York, the AFL avoided placing teams in markets where they directly competed with established NFL franchises. In 1960, the AFL began play with eight teams and a double round-robin schedule of fourteen games. New NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle took office the same year.\n\nThe AFL became a viable alternative to the NFL as it made a concerted effort to attract established talent away from the NFL, signing half of the NFL's first-round draft choices in 1960. The AFL worked hard to secure top college players, many from sources virtually untapped by the established league: small colleges and predominantly black colleges. Two of the eight coaches of the Original Eight AFL franchises, Hank Stram (Texans/Chiefs) and Sid Gillman (Chargers) eventually were inducted to the Hall of Fame. Led by Oakland Raiders owner and AFL commissioner Al Davis, the AFL established a \"war chest\" to entice top talent with higher pay than they got from the NFL. Former Green Bay Packers quarterback Babe Parilli became a star for the Boston Patriots during the early years of the AFL, and University of Alabama passer Joe Namath rejected the NFL to play for the New York Jets. Namath became the face of the league as it reached its height of popularity in the mid-1960s. Davis's methods worked, and in 1966, the junior league forced a partial merger with the NFL. The two leagues agreed to have a common draft and play in a common season-ending championship game, known as the AFL-NFL World Championship. Two years later, the game's name was changed to the Super Bowl.\nAFL teams won the next two Super Bowls, and in 1970, the two leagues merged to form a new 26-team league. The resulting newly expanded NFL eventually incorporated some of the innovations that led to the AFL's success, such as including names on player's jerseys, official scoreboard clocks, national television contracts (the addition of \"Monday Night Football\" gave the NFL broadcast rights on all of the Big Three television networks), and sharing of gate and broadcasting revenues between home and visiting teams.\n\nThe NFL continued to grow, eventually adopting some innovations of the AFL, including the two-point conversion. It has expanded several times to its current 32-team membership, and the Super Bowl has become a cultural phenomena across the United States. One of the most popular televised events annually in the United States, it has become a major source of advertising revenue for the television networks that have carried it and it serves as a means for advertisers to debut elaborate and expensive commercials for their products. The NFL has grown to become the most popular spectator sports league in the United States.\n\nOne of the things that have marked the modern NFL as different from other major professional sports leagues is the apparent parity between its 32 teams. While from time to time, dominant teams have arisen, the league has been cited as one of the few where every team has a realistic chance of winning the championship from year to year. The league's complex labor agreement with its players' union, which mandates a hard salary cap and revenue sharing between its clubs, prevents the richest teams from stockpiling the best players and gives even teams in smaller cities such as Green Bay and New Orleans the opportunity to compete for the Super Bowl. One of the chief architects of this labor agreement was former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who presided over the league from 1989 to 2006. In addition to providing parity between the clubs, the current labor contract, established in 1993 and renewed in 1998 and 2006, has kept player salaries low—the lowest among the four major league sports in the United States— and has helped make the NFL the only major American professional sports league since 1993 not to suffer any player strike or work stoppage.\n\nSince taking over as commissioner before the 2006 season, Roger Goodell has made player conduct a priority of his office. Since taking office, several high-profile players have experienced trouble with the law, from Adam \"Pacman\" Jones to Michael Vick. In these and other cases, Commissioner Goodell has mandated lengthy suspensions for players who fall outside of acceptable conduct limits. Goodell, however, has remained a largely unpopular figure to many of the league's fans, who perceive him attempting to change the NFL's identity and haphazardly damage the sport.\n\nMinor professional leagues such as the original United Football League, Atlantic Coast Football League (ACFL), Seaboard Football League and Continental Football League existed in abundance in the 1960s and early 1970s, to varying degrees of success. In 1970, Patricia Barzi Palinkas became the first woman to ever play on a men's semipro football team when she joined the Orlando Panthers of the ACFL.\n\nSeveral other professional football leagues have been formed since the AFL–NFL merger, though none have had the success of the AFL. In 1974, the World Football League formed and was able to attract such stars as Larry Csonka away from the NFL with lucrative contracts. However, most of the WFL franchises were insolvent and the league folded in 1975.\n\nIn 1982, the United States Football League formed as a spring league, and enjoyed moderate success during its first two seasons behind such stars as Jim Kelly and Herschel Walker. In 1985, the league, which lost a considerable amount of money due to overspending on players, opted to gamble on moving its schedule to fall in 1986 and filing a billion-dollar antitrust lawsuit against the NFL in an effort to stay afloat. When the lawsuit only drew a three-dollar judgment, the USFL folded.\n\nThe NFL founded a developmental league known as the World League of American Football with teams based in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The WLAF ran for two years, from 1991 to 1992. Its successor, the all-European NFL Europe League, ran from 1995 to 2007.\n\nIn 2001, the original XFL was formed as a joint venture between the World Wrestling Federation and the NBC television network. It folded after one season in the face of rapidly declining fan interest and a poor reputation. However, XFL stars such as Tommy Maddox and Rod \"He Hate Me\" Smart later saw success in the NFL. In 2020, a new XFL began play. The league, also owned by Vince McMahon is vastly different from the original incarnation.\n\nFootball is a popular participatory sport among youth. One of the earliest youth football organizations was founded in Philadelphia, in 1929, as the Junior Football Conference. Organizer Joe Tomlin started the league to provide activities and guidance for teenage boys who were vandalizing the factory he owned. The original four-team league expanded to sixteen teams in 1933 when Pop Warner, who had just been hired as the new coach of the Temple University football team, agreed to give a lecture to the boys in the league. In his honor, the league was renamed the Pop Warner Conference.\n\nToday, Pop Warner Little Scholars—as the program is now known—enrolls over 300,000 young boys and girls ages 5–16 in over 5000 football and cheerleading squads, and has affiliate programs in Mexico and Japan. Other organizations, such as the Police Athletic League, Upward, and the National Football League's NFL Youth Football Program also manage various youth football leagues.\n\nFootball is a popular sport for high schools in the United States. The National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) was founded in 1920 as an umbrella organization for state-level organizations that manage high school sports, including high school football. The NFHS publishes the rules followed by most local high school football associations. More than 13,000 high schools participate in football, and in some places high school teams play in stadiums that rival college-level facilities. For example, the school district serving the Houston suburb of Katy, Texas opened a 12,000-seat stadium in 2017 that cost over $70 million to host the district's eight high school teams. The growth of high school football and its impact on small town communities has been documented by landmark non-fiction works such as the 1990 book \"\" and the subsequent fictionalized film and television series.\n\nAmerican football has been played outside the US since the 1920s and accelerated in popularity after World War II, especially in countries with large numbers of U.S. military personnel, who often formed a substantial proportion of the players and spectators.\n\nIn 1998, the International Federation of American Football, was formed to coordinate international amateur competition. At present, 45 associations from the Americas, Europe, Asia and Oceania are organized within the IFAF, which claims to represent 23 million amateur athletes. The IFAF, which is based in La Courneuve, France, organizes the quadrennial World Championship of American Football.\n\nA long-term goal of the IFAF is for American football to be accepted by the International Olympic Committee as an Olympic sport. The only time that the sport was played was at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, but as a demonstration sport. Among the various problems the IFAF has to solve in order to be accepted by the IOC are building a competitive women's division, expanding the sport into Africa, and overcoming the current worldwide competitive imbalance that is in favor of American teams.\n\nOther codes of football share a common history with American football. Canadian football is a form of the game that evolved parallel to American football. While both games share a common history, there are some important differences between the two. A more modern sport that derives from American football is Arena football, designed to be played indoors inside of hockey or basketball arenas. The game was invented in 1981 by Jim Foster and the Arena Football League was founded in 1987 as the first major professional league to play the sport. Several other indoor football leagues have since been founded and continue to play today.\n\nAmerican football's parent sport of rugby continued to evolve. Today, two distinct codes known as rugby union and rugby league are played throughout the world. Since the two codes split following a schism on how the sport should be managed in 1895, the history of rugby league and the history of rugby union have evolved separately. Both codes have adopted innovations parallel to the American game; the rugby union scoring system is almost identical to the American game, while rugby league uses a gridiron-style field and a six-tackle rule similar to the system of downs in American Football.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It may simply depict a person dressed in fetish clothing, which could include undergarments, stockings, high heels, corsets, or boots. A common fetish theme is a woman dressed as a dominatrix.\n\nMany of the 'classic' 1940s, 1950s and 1960s-era fetish artists such as Eric Stanton and Gene Bilbrew began their careers at Irving Klaw's Movie Star News company (later Nutrix), creating drawings for episodic illustrated bondage stories.\n\nIn 1946 fetish artist John Coutts (a.k.a. John Willie) founded \"Bizarre\" magazine. Bizarre was first published in Canada, then printed in the U.S., and was the inspiration for a number of new fetish magazines such as \"Bizarre Life\". In 1957 English engineer John Sutcliffe founded \"Atomage\" magazine, which featured images of the rubber clothing he had made. Sutcliffe's work would inspire Dianna Rigg's leather-catsuit-wearing character in \"The Avengers\", a TV show that \"opened the floodgates for fetish-SM images\".\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, fetish artists such as Robert Bishop were published extensively in bondage magazines. In more recent years, the annual SIGNY awards have been awarded to the bondage artists voted the best of that year.\n\nMany artists working in the mainstream comic book industry have included fetishistic imagery in their work, usually as a shock tactic or to denote villainy or corruption. The boost that depictions of beautiful women in tight fetish outfits give to the sales of comics to a mostly teenage male comic-buying audience may also be a factor. In 1950s America comics with bondage or fetish themes began appearing. Around the same time, fetish artists influenced the cartoons of George Petty, Alberto Vargas and others, which featured in magazines like \"Playboy\" and \"Esquire\". One example of fetish imagery in comics is the catsuit-wearing, whip-wielding \"Catwoman\", who has been called, \"an icon of fetish art\".\n\nMany S&M, leather and fetish artists have produced images depicting urine fetishism (\"watersports\"), including Domino, Touko Laaksonen (\"Tom of Finland\"), Matt, and Bill Schmeling (\"The Hun\").\n\nMainstream fine artists such as Allen Jones have included strong fetish elements in their work. An artist whose erotica transcends to mainstream collectors is found in the Shunga and Shibari style works of Hajime Sorayama. Taschen books included artist Hajime Sorayama, whom his peer artists call a cross between Norman Rockwell and Salvador Dali, or an imaginative modern day Vargas. Sorayama's robotic diverse illustrative works are in the permanent collections of the New York City Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and the Smithsonian Institution, as well as the fetish arts in the private World Erotic Art Museum Miami collection.\n\nThe works of contemporary fetish artists such as Roberto Baldazzini and Michael Manning are published by companies such as NBM Publishing and Taschen.\n\n"}

They will return to the J1 League in the 2020–21 season after earning promotion the previous year.\n\nYokohama FC was formed in 1999 following the merger of Yokohama's two J.League clubs, the Flügels and the Marinos. Flügels supporters felt that their club had essentially been dissolved rather than merged with, so rejected the suggestion that they should start supporting Marinos - who had been their crosstown rivals. Instead, with money raised through donations from the general public and an affiliation with talent management company IMG, the former Flügels supporters founded the Yokohama Fulie Sports Club. Following the \"socio\" model used by FC Barcelona, the Fulie Sports Club created Yokohama FC, the first professional sports team in Japan owned and operated by its supporters.\n\nFor its first season in 1999, Yokohama FC hired former German national team and World Cup star Pierre Littbarski to be the manager and Yasuhiko Okudera, the first Japanese footballer to play professionally in Europe, to be the chairman. The club attempted to gain entry directly into the professional J.League, but the Japan Football Association only permitted entry to the amateur Japan Football League (JFL), at the time the third level of the Japanese football league system, and ruled that the club would not be eligible for promotion into J.League Division 2 at the end of its first season. So, despite finishing as JFL champion in 1999, Yokohama FC finished as JFL champion again in 2000 before being promoted to J.League Division 2.\n\nThe club spent the next 6 seasons in J.League Division 2 before finishing as champions in 2006 and gaining promotion to J. League Division 1. In 2007, just the ninth year of its existence, Yokohama FC played its first season in the top flight of Japanese football. After a poor season, the team were consigned to relegation with five games of the season still remaining. Despite their early relegation, Yokohama FC nevertheless decided the final outcome at the opposite end of the table; by defeating title contenders Urawa Red Diamonds on the last day of the season, Kashima Antlers secured the J.League Division 1 title.\n\nIn 2018, Yokohama FC narrowly missed out on automatic promotion by goal difference. The team made it to the J2 promotion final, losing to Tokyo Verdy on an stoppage time winner. In 2019, Yokohama finished second in J2 and gained automatic promotion to J1.\n\nAlthough they had a dire season in 2005, they ended 11th out of 12, they were in the top half of table throughout the 2006 season. On 26 November they finished on the top spot of the J2 league, and hence were finally promoted to division 1.\n\nThis success story was so dramatic as to make people somewhat excited in Japan. Yokohama FC's financial situation is so poor that they don't even possess their own football ground or a club house. Players did everything themselves including the carrying the goal posts and washing jerseys.\n\nSome of the main players are veteran stars, such as Kazuyoshi Miura (53), Atsuhiro Miura (58). These players once played for the National Team.\n\nThey lost all pre-season matches, even against college students, then also the first official match of the year. After this, they suddenly changed the player-manager to a freshman with little experience named Takuya Takagi 38. At the beginning of the season few expected them to become champions.\n\nFirst, Takagi concentrated on getting the basics right and focused on defense. The team then kept clean sheets in 15 consecutive games. This success gave the young players confidence to be more aggressive on the field. As a result, they didn't lose more than one game in succession and won the title.\n\nAs they could not adopt directly Flugels' white and blue strip given its similarity to that of Marinos, Yokohama FC decided to adopt an all-cyan kit, after NKK SC, a former company club which had closed in 1994. NKK SC was based in Kawasaki and played most matches at Todoroki Athletics Stadium, but used Mitsuzawa Stadium on days when the other Kawasaki clubs at the time (Verdy Kawasaki, Toshiba and Fujitsu) used it.\n\n\"As of 23 February 2020.\"\n\n\nAs of 26 February 2016.\n\n\n"}

From 1843–1856, Asher H. Ray and his wife Jane Curtis Ray were highly successful as principals of the female academy, which in the 1850s was called Louisburg Female Seminary. Among the courses offered by the seminary were history, botany, algebra, rhetoric, chemistry, geology, logic, French, Latin, Greek, guitar, and calisthenics. The respected reputation of the seminary contributed to a movement to establish a female college.\n\nIn 1855, the property of Louisburg Female Academy was transferred to the Louisburg Female College Company; the newly formed body, Louisburg Female College, opened its doors in 1857. A four-story, fifty-room brick Greek Revival-style building for the female college was constructed in 1857 on the west campus where the female academy building had formerly stood. Old Main, the central building of the Female Academy is still in use today as the administrative building of Louisburg College. Old Main was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. It is located in the Louisburg Historic District.\n\nIn August 1857, Louisburg Female College opened its doors under the management of Professor James P. Nelson. Course offerings included French, Spanish, Italian, piano, guitar, drawing, painting, and needlework. The female college continued to operate during the Civil War under presidents C.C. Andrews (1860–1861) and James Southgate, Jr. (1862–1865). After the war, about 500 Union soldiers camped in the college during May and June 1865.\n\nDuring the administration of Dr. Turner Myrick Jones (1866–1868), former president of Greensboro Female College, enrollment grew to 133 students. The regular college course in 1867 included such courses as English grammar, mythology, geography, botany, physiology, trigonometry, Latin, French, and \"Evidence of Christianity.\"\n\nAfter the College opened and closed several times during the 1870s and 1880s, S.D. Bagley became president in 1889. Matthew S. Davis, who had previously served twenty-five years as principal of the male academy, became president of the female college in 1896 and held the office until his death in 1906. He was succeeded by his daughter, Mary Davis Allen (Mrs. Ivey Allen), who was president until 1917.\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, a number of significant changes took place. The institution became known as Louisburg College, and the college became officially linked to the Methodist Church. Washington Duke, the Durham philanthropist, had acquired ownership of the college property in the 1890s; after his death, his son Benjamin N. Duke presented the property to the North Carolina Conference of the Methodist Church.\n\nOther changes in the early twentieth century included the erection of the three-story Davis Building, named in memory of Matthew S. Davis, and the reorganization of the college into an institution with junior college rating (1914–1915).\n\nDuring the presidency of Arthur D. Mohn in the 1920s, Louisburg College experienced a period of building expansion. The West Wing of Main Building, the Pattie Julia Wright Dormitory, and the Franklin County Building were constructed. Unfortunately, a disastrous fire gutted Main Building and the new West Wing in 1928. Closely following the fire came the Great Depression, and the college was burdened with debt and a shrinking enrollment.\n\nThe Reverend Armour David Wilcox, former minister of the Louisburg Methodist Church, served as president of the college from 1931 to 1937. Louisburg College became co-educational in 1931, and student enrollment immediately increased. By the end of World War II, institutional debts had been paid. Walter Patten served as president from 1939–1947 and Samuel M. Holton from 1947–1955. In 1952, Louisburg College was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.\n\nIn 1956, a planning committee of the North Carolina Conference of the Methodist Church recommended the establishment of two co-educational senior colleges and the merger of Louisburg College into one of the institutions. The college alumni and the citizens of Franklin County joined to oppose the merger. A \"Keep Louisburg at Home\" campaign emphasized the depth of local support for the junior college. The Conference decided, in response to this endeavor, to retain Louisburg College as an accredited junior college.\n\nA period of revitalization and growth occurred during the administration of president Cecil W. Robbins (1955–1974). Student enrollment, faculty size, budget, and physical plant were significantly increased and improved. In 1961, the college purchased the Mills High School property on the east side of Main Street; the Mills Building was remodeled to serve as the college auditorium-classroom building. During the Robbins administration, four dormitories, a library, a cafeteria and a student center were constructed.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1992, Dr. J. Allen Norris, Jr. served as college president. The Board of Trustees initiated the Third Century Campaign in 1980. The $4.2 million goal of the first phase of the campaign was surpassed, resulting in the construction of the E. Hoover Taft, Jr. Classroom Building. Through the generosity of the United Methodist Men of the Raleigh District, the Clifton L. Benson Chapel and Religious Life Center was opened in 1986. A new auditorium and theater complex was also constructed.\n\nDuring the 1986–87 school year, Louisburg College held a Bicentennial Celebration in recognition of its unique two-hundred-year heritage. The first college flag was designed and displayed during the celebration, and the first published history of the college, \"Louisburg College Echoes\", was issued in 1988.\n\nLouisburg College consists of 20 major buildings. It sits nicely on the north side of the city on 75 acres of land with Main Street running through the middle, dividing campus into West Campus and East Campus.\n\nStudents can earn degrees in five different fields including the Associate of Arts in General College, the Associates of Art in Education, the Associate of Science in General Science, the Associate of Science in General Science- STEM, and the Associate of Science in Business. Students can take additional coursework in disciplines such as the expressive arts and education. Students may earn federal certifications in STEM related technologies such as solar and wind power.\n\nThe Louisburg College Hurricanes rosters 13 varsity athletic teams; Men's and Women's Basketball, Men's and Women's Soccer, Men's and Women's Cross Country/Track, Baseball, Softball, Women's Volleyball, Football, and Cheerleading. Louisburg competes in the NJCAA in varying divisions depending on team. In 2015 the Men's Soccer team won the NJCAA National Championship. With Men's Cross Country finishing eighth nationally, Women's Cross Country finishing 18th. The Hurricane Football team went 7–1 and were ranked 15th at the close of the NJCAA season.\n\n\n\n"}

Actually situated in Linslade, the station is north west of London Euston and is served by London Northwestern Railway services on the West Coast Main Line. Until the 1960s the station was the start of a branch to Dunstable and Luton, with a junction just north of the present station. The station has four platforms. Platforms 1 & 2 serve the fast lines and are used by Virgin Trains services running non-stop to/from London Euston. Platforms 3 & 4 are served by slower London Northwestern railway services to/from London Euston and by Southern services between East Croydon and Milton Keynes Central.\n\nPage's Park railway station, terminus for the \"Leighton Buzzard Light Railway\" (a narrow gauge heritage railway), is on the opposite side of the town.\n\nThe first station simply known as \"Leighton\" was opened by the London and Birmingham Railway on 9 April 1838 as part of the first section of its line from to Denbigh Hall. The line had originally been planned to pass through Buckingham but opposition from the Duke of Buckingham ensured that it forced east through Linslade. A station with two-facing platforms was opened a ¼-mile south of the Linslade tunnels. These are arranged unusually for a four track main line: the southbound slow line has a tunnel to itself as does the northbound fast line, however the northbound slow and southbound fast lines share a tunnel. This stems from the fact that the line was built as double-track and when quadrupled, the two extra lines could only be placed along both sides, as single-track tunnels.\n\nIn May 1848, the station became a junction when a branch line to Dunstable was opened. The London and North Western Railway replaced the first station in February 1859 by another more permanent structure located to the south. The new building had an imposing frontage featuring arched windows. Access to the Dunstable branch was controlled by Leighton No. 2 signal box situated to the north of the station, while the actual branch signals were controlled by the main line box to the south. In 1874, land was purchased to the south of the station alongside the Dunstable branch for the construction of goods sidings, which eventually became known as \"Wing Yard\".\n\nThe LNWR was absorbed by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in the 1923 railway grouping and, in 1927, it added a crossover between the fast and slow lines. This was to play a significant role in the derailment of Royal Scot No. 6114 \"Coldstream Guardsman\" at Linslade on 22 March 1931 when the driver took the crossover at 50–60 mph instead of the regulation 15 mph. There had been a diversion in place on the fast lines and the driver had missed the warning signals. The engine overturned and six people were killed including the driver and fireman. The Scotland amateur football team was on the train, but remained unscathed.\n\nIn 1957-8 the platform buildings were rebuilt and a concrete awning placed over the platform. At the entrance a larger booking / waiting hall, central heating, electric lighting and the cycle storage, parcels and loading bay were improved.\n\nThe Great Train Robbery of 1963 occurred just south of this station, at near Ledburn, at a bridge on the southbound stretch towards Cheddington. Wing Yard was closed in February 1967 and it is now used as a car park, while the branch to Dunstable was closed from June. In 1989, the platforms were lengthened to accommodate 12-coach trains and a £1.8m project to rebuild the station was started.\nThe London and North Western Railway opened a small motive power depot at the south end of the station in 1859. This was reroofed in 1957 but closed 5 November 1962 and was demolished.\n\nThe station is served by trains operated by London Northwestern Railway and Southern.\n\nThe Monday-Saturday off-peak service is:\n\n\nLeighton Buzzard station is served by several local buses. The F70 bus route, operated by Arriva, provides a direct Bus rapid transit service to via the Luton to Dunstable Busway, with an onward connection to Luton Airport.\n\nThere have been past proposals about reopening the route to Luton when little of it had been lost to new construction, as either a rail link or as a guided busway. Although there is now a guided busway between Dunstable and Luton, much of the Leighton Buzzard to Dunstable section was lost to the Leighton Buzzard Southern Bypass.\n\nOn 22 March 1931, a passenger train was derailed due to excessive speed through a crossover. Six people were killed.\n\n"}

For several years thereafter, Ixtlilxochitl continued to pay tribute to the powerful Tepanec city of Azcapotzalco and its \"tlatoani\" Tezozomoc. However, Ixtlilxochitl grew restive in this role and, in preference to Tezozomoc's daughter, married the Mexica princess Matlalcihuatzin, a daughter of Huitzilihuitl, \"tlatoani\" of Tenochtitlan.\n\nIn 1414, Ixtlilxochitl took the title \"Chichimeca Tecuhtli\" (\"Lord of the Chichimecs\") and urged the Mexica to ally with him against Azcapotzalco. However, Huitzilihuitl, perhaps in deference to his wife, Tezozomoc's daughter, maintained his support of Tezozomoc and Azcapotzalco.\n\nIn response to Ixtlilxochitl's defiance, Tezozomoc led a large army, including Mexica forces, against Texcoco. Despite some initial successes, Tezozomoc was repulsed. Ixtlilxochitl reacted to this victory by taking the battle to Azcapotzalco, and besieged it for several months. Unable to take the city, however, Ixtlilxochitl lifted the siege, and returned to Texcoco.\n\nThe following year, the Tepanec forces, including Mexica contingents, again laid siege to Texcoco this time driving out Ixtlilxochitl, who was finally cornered in the foothills of Mount Tlaloc. His young son Nezahualcoyotl witnessed his death from the branches of a nearby tree.\n\nTexcoco was awarded to Tenochtitlan as a tributary, and Nezahualcoyotl fled into exile in Huexotzingo. Ten years later Nezahualcoyotl would avenge his father's death and retake Texcoco with the help of Itzcoatl, the future \"tlatoani\" of Tenochtitlan.\n\n"}

It is Pakistan's largest and oldest producer of alcoholic products. In 2015, it produced 10 million litres of beer, along with hundreds of tons of single malt whisky, vodka and brandy.\n\nFounded by the British in 1860, it is a publicly traded company listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange, its products are exported to India and Bangladesh. In 2014, the company established a flagship store on Park Avenue, in Manhattan, New York City. In 2013, it was named by \"Forbes\" as one of Asia's 200 best companies.\n\nThe brewery has two manufacturing units located in Rawalpindi, Punjab and Hattar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It is one of Pakistan's fastest-growing companies.\n\nThe Murree Brewery Company Ltd. was established in 1860 to meet the beer demand of British personnel at Ghora Gali near the resort place of Murree.\n\nThe Brewery was managed by the family of Edward Dyer, father of Colonel Reginald Edward Harry Dyer of Jallianwala Bagh massacre notoriety. In the 1880s the company established a further brewery in Rawalpindi and a distillery in Quetta.\n\nDue to scarcity of water in Murree in the 1920s, brewing was mostly transferred to Rawalpindi but malting continued at Ghora Gali until the 1940s, when this property was sold. This brewery, built in the Gothic revival style of architecture, was burnt during the independence of Pakistan in 1947, while the brewery in Quetta was destroyed in the 1935 Quetta earthquake. In the 1940s, the controlling share or interest in the brewery was obtained by a Parsi, Peshton Bandhara, who used to run a liquor business in Lahore before Pakistani independence. His son, the late M.P. Bandhara later carried on the business and now it is being run by a grandson, Isphanyar Bandhara.\n\nIn the 1960s the brewery imported oak casks from North America, Australia and Spain, and the underground cellars now hold over half a million litres of malt whisky for varying periods of maturation up to 12 years. Murree brewery produces a generally excellent world class single malt whisky.\n\na new beer canning and modern bottle filling facility were installed in the 1990s, imported from Germany. In 2001, the brewery had been temporarily closed for producing too much polluting waste. Authorities slapped the environmental protection order on the Murree Brewery in Rawalpindi, Islamabad's twin city.\n\nIn 2007, Murree became the Muslim world's first brewery to make 20-year-old malt whisky named \"Rarest Malt Whisky\". But, according to law, it cannot be exported and cannot be consumed by 97% of the population of Pakistan as local law prohibits Muslims from drinking alcohol. However, CEO of Murree claims that \"99 per cent of his customers are Muslims\".\n\nIn 1977, the Murree Brewery suffered a significant setback when Zulfikar Ali Bhutto imposed a total alcohol prohibition in Pakistan, to appease Islamic elements of the electorate. Subsequently, the government of General Zia-ul-Haq amended this law, requiring anyone wishing to consume alcohol to present credentials demonstrating that they were non-Muslim. The small Christian, Hindu, and Parsi communities were not large enough to support the enterprise, and production had to be scaled back.\n\nHowever, gradual relaxation of the prohibition laws has allowed Murree to introduce variations of Murree beer, vodka, gin and whisky. Today, all Murree products are readily available in legal liquor shops that operate openly in Karachi in places like Zamzama and Defence. It is also available in the interior of Sindh.\n\nMurree Beer was initially being produced in Austria for European markets and was available in various Pakistani and Indian restaurants, an enterprise which has since ceased since 2004. The current CEO, Isphanyar Bhandara has announced plans to pursue co-brewing with Foster's, but this scheme is still in development.\n\nThe Murree Brewery is one of the oldest public companies of South Asia. Its shares were traded on the Calcutta Stock Exchange as early as 1902, and it is now the oldest continuing industrial enterprise of Pakistan and among the top 25 performing public companies on the Karachi Stock Exchange.\n\nMurree's biggest competitor is the Quetta Distillery, and its products have to increasingly vie with smuggled brands from the West and India.\n\nIn 2013, Murree Brewery opened a franchise in India to a Bangalore-based entrepreneur, allowing the brewing, bottling and marketing of the beer in India.\n\nOn June 6, 2012, Scout Willis, the daughter of Hollywood actor Bruce Willis, was arrested in New York City and jailed overnight for drinking a beer manufactured by Murree Brewery.\n\nOn 19 October 2016 the Lahore High Court Lahore heard the case between Kingsway Capital LLP and Murree Brewery Co. Ltd., where Kingsway Capital LLP petitioned the Murree Brewery Co. Ltd. EOGM of 29 September 2016 to be declared as invalid and unlawful. The petition was thereafter allowed.

This ended on 31 December 1986, with the entry into force, as a result of a 1984 agreement between the government and the Holy See of the \"eight per thousand\" system.\n\nAs of 2015 there are 12 possible beneficiaries of the tax:\n\nIn addition an agreement has been signed with the Jehovah's Witnesses, but it has not yet received parliamentary ratification.\n\nIn 2015, an agreement was signed with the Soka Gakkai Italian Buddhist Institute, which was approved by law on June 28, 2016.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in spite of having made an agreement on 4 April 2007, ratified by Law 127 of 30 July 2012, is refusing to participate in the division of the funds.\n\nAlthough the 1985 law on the matter declared that the state's portion of the proceeds was to be devoted to extraordinary expenses, such as world hunger, natural disasters and refugees, since 2004 a large proportion is employed for general purposes. In 2004, €80 million out of a total of about €100 million were thus employed, leading to criticism of the fact that part of it was used to finance the Italian military mission in Iraq. Because of its financial situation in 2011, the government decided to utilize the entire sum of about €145 million for purposes other than those indicated in the 1985 law: for instance, €57,277,063 were spent on improving the prison infrastructure.\n\nThe purposes for which the religious groups may use their portions are laid down in the agreements entered into with the government. In the case of the Catholic Church, the purposes are specified in article 48 of the 1985 law: \"worship needs of the people, support of the clergy, charitable activities in favour of Italian society and the Third World\". Each year the Italian Episcopal Conference publishes the proportions it assigns under various headings. Thus at its meeting in May 2012 it approved the following distribution (in thousands of euros):\n\n\nThe financial support for the clergy brings their salary up to a certain level, such as €852.93 a month for a priest at the beginning of his service, and €1,308.57 a month for a bishop at the maximum of his biennial increments (2007 figures).\n\nFor the first fifteen years of the system there was a gradual increase of the percentage of those who chose their contributions to go to the Catholic Church and a corresponding diminution of those who chose the State as beneficiary. Of those who exercised a choice, 76.17% opted for the Catholic Church in 1990, increasing to 89.81% in 2004 and falling to 86.05% in 2006 and 85.01% in 2007. Since in 2007, for instance, only 43.50% of those who declared their incomes expressed a choice, those who did indicate the Catholic Church as beneficiary were less than 37% of the taxpayers, a figure much lower than the proportion of Italians who declare themselves Catholics, which corresponded rather to the proportion opting for the Church among those who did indicate a choice. Declarations in favour of the State, which were 22.31% in 1990, dropped to their lowest ever level of 7.60% in 2005, recovering later and reaching 11.95% in 2007.\n\nThe eight-per-thousand tax has significantly helped the Piedmontese Waldensians. A Protestant community whose origins predate the Reformation, the Waldensians have only about 25,000 enlisted members but about 412,000 Italians support them and their charitable works.\n\n"}

{"id": "1934011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1934011", "title": "Average bitrate", "text": "Average bitrate\n\nAverage bitrate (ABR) refers to the average amount of data transferred per unit of time, usually measured per second, commonly for digital music or video. An MP3 file, for example, that has an average bit rate of 128 kbit/s transfers, on average, 128,000 bits every second. It can have higher bitrate and lower bitrate parts, and the average bitrate for a certain timeframe is obtained by dividing the number of bits used during the timeframe by the number of seconds in the timeframe. Bitrate is not reliable as a standalone measure of audio/video quality, since more efficient compression methods use lower bitrates to encode material at a similar quality.\n\nAverage bitrate can also refer to a form of variable bitrate (VBR) encoding in which the encoder will try to reach a target average bitrate or file size while allowing the bitrate to vary between different parts of the audio or video. As it is a form of variable bitrate, this allows more complex portions of the material to use more bits and less complex areas to use fewer bits. However, bitrate will not vary as much as in variable bitrate encoding. At a given bitrate, VBR is usually higher quality than ABR, which is higher quality than CBR (constant bitrate). ABR encoding is desirable for users who want the general benefits of VBR encoding (an optimum bitrate from frame to frame) but with a relatively predictable file size. Two-pass encoding is usually needed for accurate ABR encoding, as on the first pass the encoder has no way of knowing what parts of the audio or video need the highest bitrates to be encoded.\n\n\n"}

The screenplay was written by Mark Steven Johnson, who also wrote the sequel \"Grumpier Old Men\" (1995). The original music score was composed by Alan Silvestri. This was the sixth film starring both Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, and their first pairing since 1981's \"Buddy Buddy\".\n\nIn Wabasha, Minnesota, retirees John Gustafson and Max Goldman are feuding next-door neighbors. Living alone, they spend their time ice fishing and pulling cruel practical jokes on each other, including John leaving a dead fish in Max’s truck. Their rivalry irritates their friend Chuck, owner of the town bait shop, and Max’s son Jacob, who is running for mayor. Dodging the attempts of IRS Agent Snyder to collect a serious debt, John supports his daughter Melanie when she separates from her husband Mike.\n\nJohn and Max both find themselves attracted to Ariel Truax, a free-spirited art professor who moves in across the street. Chuck has Thanksgiving dinner with Ariel, prompting John and Max to compete for her affections. Chuck dies, and Max discovers John’s IRS debt.

John and Ariel have sex – his first time since 1978 – and a jealous Max drives John’s fishing shanty into thin ice, which John narrowly escapes. He confronts Max, and the source of their animosity is revealed: Max resents John for marrying Max’s high school sweetheart. John explains she was unfaithful and Max was happier with the woman he did marry, but Max reminds John that he will have nothing to offer Ariel once the IRS takes his house. With this on his mind, John ends his relationship with Ariel, who warns that he will regret the risks he did not take in life.\n\nJacob is elected mayor, and Max continues courting Ariel. On Christmas, Melanie comes to visit and John is upset to learn she has reconciled with Mike. Giving her the same warning Ariel gave him, John leaves for the local bar. At Melanie’s request, Jacob asks Max to settle things with John, but the fathers are unable to mend their dispute and John storms out of the bar.

{"id": "1934022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1934022", "title": "Florence Ellinwood Allen", "text": "Florence Ellinwood Allen\n\nFlorence Ellinwood Allen (March 23, 1884 – September 12, 1966) was a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. She was the first woman to serve on a state supreme court and one of the first two women to serve as a United States federal judge. In 2005, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.\n\nAllen was born on March 23, 1884 in Salt Lake City, Utah, the daughter of Clarence Emir Allen Sr., a mine manager, and later United States Representative from Utah, and his wife Corinne Marie, née Tuckerman. She was one of seven children—five girls, one of whom died in infancy, and two boys. Her father was a professor and a linguist, and the family moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where he was hired by what was then called the Western Reserve University and is today called Case Western Reserve University. Young Florence grew up in Cleveland, where her father shared his love of languages with her, teaching her Greek and Latin before she was a teenager. She also showed an early love of poetry, as well as a talent for music, and after attending New Lyme Institute in Ashtabula, Ohio, she decided to attend Western Reserve, with music as her major. Allen graduated in 1904 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, and her father then sent her to Berlin, German Empire to continue her musical studies. While she was there, she worked as a correspondent for a New York magazine called the \"Musical Courier\". Her original plan was to become a concert pianist but she sustained an injury that cut her music career short. She returned to Ohio in 1906 and took a job as the music critic for \"The Plain Dealer\" (Cleveland, Ohio) newspaper, a position she held till 1909. By this time, she had begun showing an increasing interest in politics and law, which led her to take a Master of Arts degree in Political Science from Western Reserve; she completed it in 1908. She also took courses in constitutional law, and would have pursued a degree, but at that time, Western Reserve's law school did not admit women. So Allen took special classes and tutorials, and became more determined to have a legal career. She attended the law school at the University of Chicago for a year, and then transferred to New York University School of Law. In order to pay her tuition, she found work as a legal investigator and researcher for the New York League for the Protection of Immigrants. In 1913, she got her Bachelor of Laws, graduating with honors. She returned to Cleveland and was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1914.\n\nBy her own admission, she was not a success at first. She only made about $25 during her first month, and all she could afford for her office was two chairs and a borrowed typewriter. As she told a reporter in a 1934 interview, \"I had no clients. And I had no money. But I had great hopes.\" However, in order to become successful, what she needed was some experience, so she did volunteer work with the local Legal Aid Society of Cleveland, where she not only got that experience but got involved with an important case about suffrage. As a child, her mother had taken her to see famous suffragists Susan B. Anthony and Anna Howard Shaw giving talks about women's rights. And the belief that women should be treated as equals under the law undoubtedly resonated with her even more as a result of her struggles to be taken seriously as an attorney. She became even more interested in politics, and more committed to the cause of women's suffrage. She was active in the Women's Suffrage Party and began challenging local laws that limited women's participation in the political process. And she argued one particular case that went all the way to the Ohio Supreme Court: thanks to her efforts, she won the women of East Cleveland the right to vote in municipal elections. During this time, she also became involved in another cause, one that would be important to her all of her life: disarmament and the quest for world peace. For Allen, this was personal: both of her brothers died while serving their country during the First World War.\n\nOnce she won a few cases and gained the respect of her male colleagues, her career flourished. In 1919, she was appointed the assistant prosecuting attorney for Cleveland's Cuyahoga County. An active Democrat, she nevertheless encountered opposition from Democratic party chairman Burr Gongwer. However, the appointment was approved and she became the first woman in Ohio to hold such a position. She then began bringing cases before the grand jury. She also continued to advocate women's rights, even giving talks about her devotion to the Democratic party and the political process. By 1920, she was elected as a Common Pleas judge, on a non-partisan ticket. She was the first woman in this position too, and during her time on the bench she tried nearly 900 cases. Undoubtedly, her biggest challenge was a case involving gangster Frank Motto, who was convicted of the murder of two men during a robbery. With women on the jury and a woman judge, legal critics wondered whether the stereotype about women being emotional, and thus lenient, would come into play, but it did not. Motto was convicted, and in mid-May 1921, Allen sentenced Motto to the electric chair. Her meteoric rise continued when in 1922, Allen was elected to the Ohio Supreme Court. She immediately told reporters that she intended to keep partisan politics out of the judiciary. It was a promise she would keep.\n\nIn 1928, Allen was re-elected to a second six-year term on the Ohio Supreme Court. All of the winners in that election were Republicans except for her. She continued to be a popular figure in Ohio, honored by numerous civic groups for her fairmindedness; and lawyers who came before her praised her willingness to listen. And while she was not afraid to make the difficult decisions, even on death penalty cases, Allen was not just a \"law and order\" judge. She was also a mentor, who encouraged young women to become lawyers. She continued to give educational talks about the law, and she worked tirelessly to improve women's legal rights. She was a proponent of jury service for women, at a time when many states still did not allow women to serve, and she continued to encourage women to be politically active even while remaining non-partisan herself. By 1930, her reputation was so positive that some newspapers were suggesting that she be nominated for a seat on the United States Supreme Court. Among them was the \"Christian Science Monitor\", which praised Allen for her \"distinguished achievements\" as a jurist.\n\nA pacifist, Allen was an opponent of war and argued that the only way to avoid war was to outlaw it. War must be made outlawed and declared a crime, she said. She also called for the establishment of an international court that has jurisdiction over purely international disputes and that international law should be codified on the basis of equity and right.\n\nAllen was nominated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on March 6, 1934, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit vacated by Judge Smith Hickenlooper. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 15, 1934, and received her commission on March 21, 1934. She was the second woman to serve in the federal judiciary and the first woman to serve as an Article III federal judge. Genevieve R. Cline was earlier appointed to serve as an Article I federal judge on the United States Customs Court. Her nomination to the prestigious position received widespread praise. Newspaper articles described Allen as \"an able jurist\" and a \"profound student\" of the law. Allen served as Chief Judge from 1958 to 1959. She was a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States in 1958. She assumed senior status on October 5, 1959. Her service terminated on September 12, 1966, due to her death.\n\nAllen continued her ongoing advocacy of women's rights. She was a member of the National Association of Business and Professional Women, and spoke at several of their conventions, and was a member of the National Association of Women Lawyers. Allen continued to advocate an end to wars. In 1935, she was one of ten \"outstanding American women\", with Eleanor Roosevelt and feminist leader Carrie Chapman Catt, to contribute to \"Why Wars Must Cease\". In her essay, Allen asserted that wars \"unleash demoralizing instincts\" such as \"callousness, cynicism, and greed.\" She said they also contribute to numerous social problems, including the break-up of families, and increases in crime.\n\nThe press continued to speculate on Allen as a possible Supreme Court nominee. In early 1939, when Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis was about to retire, some of Allen's supporters tried to persuade President Roosevelt that it was time to name a woman, and they reminded the president that Allen was extremely qualified. Chief among advocates on her behalf was Lillian D. Rock, former vice president of the National Association of Women Lawyers and chair of a newly created committee whose purpose was to encourage the appointment of more women to important positions in government. Allen was not named to the Supreme Court, however, and it was another male judge, William O. Douglas, who replaced Justice Brandeis. For the next few years, every time a vacancy occurred, Allen's supporters would again suggest her, but to no avail.\n\nOn the Circuit Court, Sixth Circuit, she heard cases from Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, and Tennessee. In 1940, she wrote \"This Constitution of Ours\". Even after World War II broke out, Allen remained steadfast in her determination to work for peace. She continued speaking and gave talks both in person and on radio. In 1944, the National Association of Women lawyers put her name forth as someone who should be involved in international peace negotiations. When the war ended, she continued to speak to civic groups, especially women's clubs. Her message was that relying on the United Nations would not prevent the next war. It was essential for individual citizens to keep demanding that each country—whether large or small—have respect for the rule of law. \"To secure peace, there must be justice,\" she told 3,000 attendees at a conference of the National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs. \"There cannot be justice unless there is a rebirth of moral principle among the nations. There cannot be a rebirth of moral principle unless the conscience of the peoples becomes articulate.\" Allen herself remained a very articulate spokeswoman on the issues she cared about. She was regarded as such a credible figure that in 1947, the American Academy of Political and Social Science asked her to do a study of women's voting patterns, to offer her assessment of whether women were in fact using the franchise, and whether they were active in the political process. In later talks, Allen expressed the opinion that while many women were in fact voting and speaking out on issues, there was a generational shift taking place. The dynamic women leaders who had fought for suffrage and brought about greater participation for women in other areas of public life were now deceased, and they had not yet been replaced. She expressed concern about this lack of new and dynamic leadership, and hoped new leaders would emerge.\n\nAllen's supporters again sought to have her appointed to the United States Supreme Court during Harry S. Truman's presidency, but Truman seemed to be opposed to having a woman sitting on the highest court of the land. Allen was later told that Truman's reluctance to appoint her had to do with his belief that having a woman around would make the male judges uncomfortable. \"They say they couldn't sit around with their robes off and their feet up and discuss the problems.\" Truman's reluctance to appoint a woman extended to other venues. When there were more than 20 Federal court vacancies, his original list of nominees was all male; only after some influential women politicians protested, the president named one woman, Burnita Shelton Matthews, to the bench of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in 1949. After her retirement, she continued to do speaking engagements and began working on her autobiography. It was called \"To Do Justly,\" and was published in the autumn of 1965.\n\nIn declining health after falling and breaking her hip, Allen died on September 12, 1966, in Waite Hill, Ohio, where she had been living with a distant cousin since her retirement.\n\nIn 2005, Allen was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.\n\n\n"}

He was already suffering from Alzheimer's disease, and had to be gently coached through his role in the film. He died of the disease two years later in 1997.\n\nThe feud between Max (Walter Matthau) and John (Jack Lemmon) has cooled and they have become good friends. Their children, Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Jacob (Kevin Pollak), have become engaged. Meanwhile, John is enjoying his marriage to new wife Ariel (Ann-Margret).

Max retaliates by disconnecting John's motor from his boat and broadcasting himself nude (while Ariel was making a clay statue of him) at a Sears department store. Ariel is stressed out because of it and leaves John until things settle down. At the restaurant, Francesca is worried about all the time Maria spends with Max. She reminds her daughter of her five failed marriages and worries that Max will make it six.\n\nAfter being convinced to take a long look at herself, Maria reluctantly stops seeing Max. Distraught over losing Ariel, John heads to the lake for his father's advice but finds that he has died in his favorite spot with a fishing pole in one hand and a can of beer in the other. Following the funeral and the spreading of J.W.'s ashes in the lake, John and Max call off their feud again and John and Ariel reconcile.\n\nAfter realizing that their own inability to properly plan a wedding is what drove their kids to call it off, they decide to set it right. They help Jacob and Melanie reconcile, and manage to catch \"Catfish Hunter\" but they reluctantly decide to release it so it can be with J.W. in the lake, then clarify their own drama. After they let it go, they realize that they're late for a wedding happening in town and rush to the church as quickly as they can. The wedding is revealed to be for Max and Maria, who have reconciled (Jacob and Melanie have eloped). On the way to their honeymoon, they discover Max's one-eyed bulldog, Lucky, in the car with them, being put there by John earlier as a prank. Ragetti's is also reformed so it will be both a restaurant and a bait shop.\n\n\"Grumpier Old Men\" grossed $71 million at the North American box office, against a production budget of $25 million. \"Grumpier Old Men\" beat its predecessor's total of $70 million and cost $10 million less to make than the original. The film was released in the United Kingdom on March 1, 1996.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 17% based on 18 reviews, with a rating average of 4.2/10. On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating to reviews, the film has a score of 46 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film a score of 2 out of 4 stars. Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" described the film as contrived and getting by on the star power of the cast. Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" wrote: \"\"Grumpier Old Men\", which was directed by Howard Deutch from a screenplay by Mark Steven Johnson, who also wrote the first film, doesn't even try to make sense.

The popular series has sold over five million copies worldwide.\nThe character Hairy Maclary made his first appearance in 1983 in the book titled \"Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy\". He is the protagonist in twelve books in the series, and there are a further nine books about his friends.\n\nHairy Mclary's adventures are usually in the company of his other animal friends who include the dachshund Schnitzel von Krumm, dalmatian Bottomley Potts, greyhound-cross Bitzer Maloney, mastiff Hercules Morse and Old English sheepdog Muffin McLay. The tomcat Scarface Claw is their formidable opponent.\n\nAccording to the books' website, Hairy Maclary is \"... a small dog of mixed pedigree.\" In the 1990s, a TV series featuring ten five-minute episodes based on the series premiered. In 2015 a sculpture of Hairy Maclary and other characters from the books was officially unveiled in Tauranga, New Zealand on the waterfront by former New Zealand Prime Minister John Key. In the 2019 TVNZ series \"Goodnight Kiwi\" the prime minister Jacinda Ardern read \"Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy\" the episode aired on TVNZ 2 on Christmas Day. \n\nHairy Maclary books are designed to be read by an adult to a child. The plots are simple, keeping with the comprehension-level of the age group for which they are written. They generally involve Hairy and his friends in adventurous scenarios pitched against local cats. The animals in this series, unlike the creatures of Beatrix Potter's stories, are not given human thoughts and motives, their actions tell the stories, and reflect their animal natures.\n\nEach double-sided page has an illustration on one side, and text on the other. The pictures and the written words together tell the story, and the illustrations and their meanings are as important as the text. The books have a wide format that enables a child seated beside an adult to have a full view of the picture page while the adult reads.\n\nThe text is written in rhythmic verse that flows easily with simple rhymes like \"Bottomley Potts covered in spots, Hercules Morse as big as a horse\". Characters, events and therefore language are repetitive and cumulative, in the manner of \"Old MacDonald had a farm\". Each book contains a twist or some sort of conclusion at the end. The repetitions permit a young child to anticipate what is coming next and repeat the words.<poem> \n\"Schnitzel von Krumm \nwith a very low tum, \nBitzer Maloney \nall skinny and bony, \nMuffin McLay \nlike a bundle of hay, \nBottomley Potts \ncovered in spots, \nHercules Morse \nas big as a horse \n\nand Hairy Maclary \nfrom Donaldson's Dairy\" \n</poem>Although the books are designed to entertain young children, they are not intended as \"early readers\", as are, for example, the \"Cat in the Hat\" books by Doctor Seuss which have a very basic and largely phonic vocabulary. The Hairy Maclary books, despite their simple stories, introduce the listening child to some long but very expressive words, which are not part of the average pre-schooler vocabulary but must be understood by the child in the context in which they occur. For example, the noise made by a stranded cat and the excited dogs who discover it is described as a \"cacophony\".\n\nLynley Dodd's illustrations are closely observed from life. The breeds of dogs, the types of houses and the plants growing in each garden can generally be identified. The stories seem to exist in a real suburb in the real world. Hairy Maclary's home, for example, has a red corrugated iron roof supported on wooden brackets, and the garden has a frangipani tree, a picket fence and a row of agapanthi. Each picture promotes investigation and discussion between the child and the reader, as events unfold in the pictures which are not described in the text. In the first book of the series the repeated lines \"...and Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy\" accompany a series of illustrations showing Hairy Maclary sniffing the bottom of a lamp-post, burrowing into a hedge, barking at some birds and raiding a garbage can. Close observation is encouraged by the inclusion in many of the pictures of a tiny glimpse of the dog who has been named on the previous page, as it approaches or walks out of the picture, showing only the point of a nose or the tip of a tail.\n\n\n"}

These squadrons became the 334th, 335th, and 336th Fighter Squadrons of the 4th Fighter Group based at RAF Debden. The group was the first fighter group to fly combat missions over Germany airspace, the first to escort bombers over Berlin, and the first selected to escort bombers on shuttle bombing runs landing in Russia. The group was credited with shooting down 1,016 German planes.\n\nThe Eagle Squadrons were formed in 1940 with volunteer pilots from the United States prior to its entry into World War II in December 1941. The three Eagle Squadrons formed between September 1940 and July 1941 were turned over to the Eighth Air Force in .

{"id": "1934088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1934088", "title": "Furg Citadel", "text": "Furg Citadel\n\nThe Citadel of Furg, or \"Arg e Furg\", is a citadel from the 18th century, located in Furg Village in Darmian County, South Khorasan, Iran. The citadel was founded by Meerza Muhammad Rafiee Darmiany I (Lama).\n\nFork Castle or Mirza Rafi Khan Castle is located in South Khorasan Province, Iran. It has to a great extent survived deliberate and natural destructive events, and sustained itself despite passage of time. The castle is located in Forg Village. five kilometers from the city of \"Darmaian\", South Khorasan Province.\n\nFork Castle is located on the north side Fork Village at an altitude of 1840 meters on the edge of the heights of Darmian Valley leading to Asadiyeh plain. It has a good strategic situation, because it has a commanding view of the entire village, farms and roads around its eastern region. The area of the castle is about 9200 square meters which extends from east to west. The main entrance of the castle is located within the eastern walls, which is also the lowest point of the castle. In general, in the architecture of the castle from the east to the west, three major parts are recognizable. The first part on the east includes a barn, living place of crew, place of keeping cattle and dock warehouse. The second part of the castle, which is in the center of the castle, is located on a higher altitude than the first part and has been constructed at a distance of 50 meters from the place of food and military supplies and place of residing soldiers, and the third part which has the centrality state of the castle has been built in the highest part of the castle on two floors overlooking the entire village and the roads the area. In the eastern part of the castle including entrance, guard towers, water storage and other spaces, it is impossible to discern the purpose of their construction, owing to high rate of their destruction. Due to existence of the remnants of tower and rampart in the middle of the section with the first part, it is likely that this part was the second defensive phase of the castle, so that the defensive layers of the main part of the castle, i.e. Kohandej, is more completed. There is a brick tower with cruciform or lozenge design decorations in the northeast corner of this part which is known as penthouse tower among the people of the village. The third part of the castle located in the utmost west and the highest part of the castle is separated from the second part by two towers and fortified and long walls. The existence of these towers and ramparts shows the great importance of this part. This part is considered as the alcove of castle has more untouched spaces than the previous two parts. The existence of spaces like the vestibule, connecting corridors, stables, food storage, watchtowers and spaces with other applications are the most important specifications of this part; Alcove or citadel consists of two floors of which the upper floor, except the limited area, have been destroyed. The other architectural element is a burrow that has an exit door, and which has been designed for water supply during castle siege or for emergency and clandestine exit.\n\nThis tunnel has many stairs, of which some one hundred are still usable. These were used during the battle between Mirza Rafi Khan with Mir Alam Khan and his son Amir Asadollah Khan. This battle is referred to in Einolvaghaye\"… Esmaeil Khan, Atakhan, and their families obeyed and followed; and Afghans with Mirza Rafi Khan, Haji Fathkhan Afghan and Behboud son of Nazarkhan Ghalehgahi erected a burrow on one side of the Castle and escaped at night\". In this part the author may have made a mistake. They most likely used the same burrow that had previously been made. Otherwise; digging a burrow in a limited period of time during the war to escape was not possible. One of the key features of the castle is its physical and spatial structure, which follows the topography of its location, and the situation of which distinguishes it from other castles, particularly, mountain fortresses. In spite of the fact that the towers and the ramparts of the castle have provided the required strength to it, its location is not without defect in such manner that the mountains of the west castle are adjacent thereof. Using this weak point by the attackers has also been pointed out in Einolvaghaye. Of course, in respect of the problem mentioned above, it ought to be noted that the location of the castle should be studied within its own time. Perhaps in the era of Naseri (Naser al-Din Shah) in which cannons were vastly used in local wars in the region, this vulnerability of the castle has been revealed, while; in the early periods that these weapons were not common, perhaps it provided the best location. There is not yet an exact and documented comment on the early history of the castle construction. Based on the existing documents and the Book of Divan-e-Lame and local comments, the construction of the building was started on the early 1160AH, during the reign of Nader Shah Afshar, by Mirza Bagha Khan, son of the First Mirza Rafi Khan, and then completed by his son, the Second Mirza Rafi Khan. Being unknown the right time of the construction of the castle has also been mentioned in Divan-e-Lame and said: \"But, was it really started the building of the castle by Mirza Bagha Khan and completed by his son, Mirza Rafi Khan (Lame's grandson) or is it one of the old buildings and these two persons and the former ones, everyone has had a hand in it and made effort to repair and complete it, is something that has not been achieved yet; not based on the written documents and not through oral promise of the elders. Likely, Lame and his father had possessed the castle and it was their lace of residence and administration center and shelter at the time of their affliction and difficulty against attack of the then enemies and princes \n\nIn the Book of Haghayeghol Akhbr Naseri, on the events of the lunar year of 1268, it is said about Mirza Rafi Khan as follows: \"In the same year, Mirza Rafi Khan, who was staying in Ghaenat places, started to oppose, General Pashakhan with two legions from city of Semnan and et al and a collective of cavalry and forty cannons were assigned to punish him. Mirza Rafi Khan went to Harat. Zahiroddoleh interceded for him, his crime was pardoned.\" In Qajar era, a hard conflict occurred between the chief town of Ghaenat and the chief town of \"Forg\" and \"Darmian\" which finally resulted in killing Mirza Rafi Khan and occupying the castle. Among the influential lieutenant governors within this time period, we can point out to Mirza Mohammad Baghakhan, son of the first Mirza Rafi Khan, the second Mirza Rafi Khan, the third Mirza Rafi Khan, Mohammad Ebrahim Khan, Abdolali Khan and Aligholi Khan. After the third Mirza Rafikhan having been killed, those of the same dynasty took the responsibility of lieutenant governor in Darmian and Forg. Among the considerable points about Darmian's lieutenant governors, is the struggles occurred between this lieutenant governor with Khozeimeh family who were ruling Birjand. These conflicts have also been mentioned in Divan-e-Lame, including partiality of Lame's family from Nader Shah and Khozeimeh from Safavids which caused dispute, conflict and competition. These competitions sometimes associated with marriage between the family of Rafiei and Khozeimeh, in this way not only it was trying to make inconspicuous the local conflicts and differences, but also to strengthen relationship and unity between them with other lieutenant governors and elders of the area. In the same way, six daughters of the second Mriza Rafi Khan married with the great persons and lieutenant governors of Birjand, Nehbandan, Fanoud and Noghab. The non-written documents and instruments in respect of the events related to the date of construction or historical and natural disasters that have taken place in this complex are limited and it needs more digging and studies. The only inscription carved on the mortar surface of the water storage of the castle indicates the lunar date of 1217 and suggests that the building was repaired by an artisan named \"Abosaeid Jaiki\" in the early Qajar era. The studies made on the local history of the region is also greatly in consistency with the dates and the sovereignty of Mirza Bakhakhan and after him, his children and his offspring especially the second Mirza Rafi Khan and the third Mirza Rafi Khan certifies the foregoing matters. However, there is little documented information on the matter that whether the castle had been existed before sovereignty of Rafiei family as the local governors or not. Description of this castle and its situation have been recorded in come historic books and itineraries, for example, Riazi Heravi writes in Einolvaghayeh Book as follows: \"Forg Castle is 12 miles away from Birjand and locates around plain and entrance of \"Darmian\" valley and has a lot of gardens and trees and enjoys a good climate, the castle is on the top of a mountain of which walls and towers have been firmly constructed by mud bricks and its foundation was made by Ajin stone and has two Haji Shir around itself and two embankments each of which diameter is five cubits. The European tourists such as \"Doctor Forbes\" in 1814 AD, \"Colonel Mac GERGER\" in 1875, and \"Khanykf\" and \"Blue\" have visited the castle and have stated descriptions in their itineraries. Colonel Mac GARGAR also brought about the words of Doctor Forbes in his itinerary titled \"A Journey to the Province of Khorasan\" as follows: \"The castle has been built on the top of a hill at an altitude of 2000 to 2500 feet which could be threatened by the fire load from the highlands of the north and west. A mountain is located in the south and on the other two sides which is away 1200 yards from the peak to the walls of the castle. An interesting point that Mac GERGER said as quoted by Doctor Forbes is: \"Three water storages were provided inside the castle which is said that the storage of their water will supply the utility of a great garrison for the period of one year and six months.\n\nThe Forg Castle has been excavated two times so far. The first time was performed during the restoration operation of the castle in the year of 2001 in order to clarify the situation of plan and map of Kohandej. During the excavation, the spaces such as stable, food storage, burrows and corridors connecting different parts of the Kohandej were detected. This monument has been registered in the List of National Works under No. 3450 on March 18, 2001. As stated above, based on the evidences and chronicles, the foundation of the building goes back to Afsharieh era. The attribution of Forg Castle (Mirza Rafi Khan Castle) to Ismailia should be taken with caution because the Ismailia castles have special characteristics, for example, most of them have been constructed in out of the way and mountainous areas in order to be hidden and camouflaged. In the castles Ismailia was putting their followers under military and sectarian trainings and sending them to different regions for assassination of the authorities opposing to their thoughts. The names of those people were in encrypted form, which were sometimes changed too. Acting stealthily, fighting against central government and their local puppet rulers and propagating ideological thought relating to Ismailia sect were the most important tasks fulfilled in the Ismailia castles. The central governments were trying to destroy the fortresses. The architecture and construction of these structures which were being founded with speed and limited resources have been entirely varied from the official governmental castles. As the peak time of the Ismailia sect's activities coincided with the Abbasid and Seljuk Caliphs and as this sect was removed due to the brutal attack of the Mongol on Iran, it is far-fetched that the overall present structure of Forg Castle would remain safe and applicable from that time through Afsharieh era. Consequently, the greatness and external specifications of Forg Castle differ from Ismailia castles and this castle has not been hidden and has been considered as an official and a visible governmental castle for protection and establishment of security of the region. The Iranian official castles consisted of three Kohandej (place of living the ruler), Sharestan (Place of living of the people of village) and Rabath (farms and gardens) sections since a long time ago. The three parts were connected together in such manner that this specification is observed in Forg Castle. Forg village surrounded the Forg Castle and attached to it since a long time ago, while Ismailia castles were away from the residential and inhabited regions and were lacking those features. Normally, castles were built to resist insurgency and rebellion, were mostly constructed on the top of mountains and in impassable passes, were often without a specified geometrical design or previous plan, and were irregularly built. But the official and governmental castles were being constructed with previous plan and by choosing the right strategic position overlooking the surrounding areas in plains or beside passages and caravan roads and/or on the borders in order to protect, to guard and to provide security to the desired regions. Therefore; the Forg Castle or Mirza Rafi Khan Castle is an official building; and its administrative and governmental nature is clear. It seems that the castle had governmental and official application for protecting surrounding areas and frontier control throughout the history.\n\n"}

This is the only evidence we have from the time documenting his reign and thus this branch of the Achaemenid royal family.\nAnother attestation of his reign is the later Behistun Inscription, where his great-grandson Darius I states that eight Achaemenid kings preceded him - and then, he must be counting Ariaramnes as a king. \n\nHis English name is derived - via Latin - from the Greek .

TAG began as a small Bible study led by Lydia Little, a Washington, DC area resident who had experienced the Jesus People revival in California and wanted to see similar renewal brought to local young people. TAG continued to grow in numbers with the Tuesday night meetings moving from the Blair High School auditorium to a larger auditorium space at Christ Church of Washington. Larry Tomczak and C.J. Mahaney became the main teachers with Jim Orban (eventual son-in-law of Lydia Little) leading worship and a number of other young people taking on other leadership responsibilities as the group grew. At its largest point TAG attracted over 2,000 people, primarily young attendees under the age of 25. \n\nIn 1977 a small group of people (55 at the first meeting, many of whom were TAG attendees) began to gather in the basement of a suburban Maryland home. Simultaneously, the TAG ministry began to wind down and met for the last time in December 1979.\n\nThe young church called itself Gathering of Believers. As it grew in size, it met in different schools and facilities around Montgomery County. For a couple of years the church held services at the Cedar Club building on Muncaster Mill Road. It then shifted to a decentralized model with separate groups meeting in College Park, Gaithersburg, Silver Spring, and Wheaton. In the mid-'80s the groups consolidated as Covenant Life Church and met together at Magruder High School. In September 1993 the church opened its new facility on a 45-acre campus located at 7501 Muncaster Mill Road. It expanded to its current size in 2002.\n\nThe initial church group practiced \"co-equal\" leadership with a highly participatory congregation. Church life centered on numerous small groups meeting in member homes. Over the first few years Larry Tomczak and C. J. Mahaney increasingly assumed larger leadership roles. C.J. became lead pastor of the church while Larry provided leadership for a growing association of churches that were either planted by Covenant Life (13 churches in multiple states) or \"adopted\" on the basis of shared doctrinal convictions and relational ties. Originally called People of Destiny International, the association's name changed over time to PDI, then Sovereign Grace Ministries, and finally to Sovereign Grace Churches (2014). In the early '90s C.J. was selected to lead the association of churches in addition to his responsibilities as senior pastor of Covenant Life. Tomczak relocated to Atlanta in 1996 to plant a new church and left the association by 1998. He later stated that the increasingly Calvinistic theology was a major factor in this parting of the ways.\n\nMahaney held the role of senior pastor for over 20 years, and in September 2004 passed this role to Joshua Harris. C.J. continued as a mentor while leading Sovereign Grace, whose offices were located in the same facility.\n\nIn 2011, documents written by a former Sovereign Grace leader were circulated online that triggered sharp disagreements between leaders and internal strife within the church. Despite a formal reconciliation process mediated by Ambassadors of Reconciliation, in December 2012 members of Covenant Life Church voted to end their formal association with Sovereign Grace Ministries, citing numerous differences, but especially noting differences on issues related to church polity.\n\nJoshua Harris and C.J. Mahaney \"resigned from the council of The Gospel Coalition (TGC) in 2014. Also in 2014, a former church member was convicted of sexually abusing three boys in their homes in the 1980s and early 1990s. None of the abuse occurred at Covenant Life Church.\n\nIn 2014, a civil lawsuit against Covenant Life Church and Sovereign Grace Ministries alleging a cover-up of child sexual abuse was dismissed in Maryland. The case was dismissed by a lower court with prejudice since the statute of limitations for a civil suit in Maryland had passed. The case was finally dismissed by Maryland's highest court on September 22, 2014.\n\nIn January 2015 Joshua Harris announced plans to step down as lead pastor and pursue formal graduate theological studies at Regent College in Vancouver, BC. He stated in an interview that \"the isolation of Covenant Life, and of a small cluster of churches of which it was a part, may have fed leadership mistakes, including the decision of pastors — himself among them — to handle a child sexual abuse case internally instead of going to police.\"\n\nIn December 2015, Covenant Life Church voted to call P.J. Smyth (Johannesburg, South Africa) to be its new lead pastor. After a lengthy immigration process, he and his family received their visas in October 2016 and he was installed on January 29, 2017. \n\nEarly in 2018, tensions developed within the Board of Elders. Outside leaders and church members were invited to help resolve differences related to preaching and polity, but in July the elders and Pastor Smyth decided to part ways. Covenant Life's Board of Elders continues to provide leadership for the church. Smyth plans to plant a new church in the DC Metro region. When Smyth left the church, many middle aged people, and parents with children left the church too and decided to follow Smyth and help him start a new church.\n\nIn August 2018, Covenant Life Church has 4 pastors on staff and 4 non-staff elders. The church meets at 10 AM on Sunday mornings at 7501 Muncaster Mill Road in Gaithersburg, Maryland.\n\nCovenant Life School, an accredited K-12 day school, is housed in Covenant Life's facility. Over 250 students currently attend the day school, which is accredited by the Association of Christian Schools International and the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. \n\nCovenant Life Church also provides a Family Schools Program to support homeschooling parents in the church and community.\n\nCovenant Life has over 25 years sent out 13 church plants to many cities in the U.S. and a few abroad, including Cleveland (1982), Chicago, San Diego, Mexico, Texas, and the Philippines (1983-1984).\n\nIn 1984, Covenant Life Church planted Covenant Fellowship Church in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 2006, Covenant Life Church planted Sovereign Grace Church of Frederick in Frederick, Maryland.\n\nIn 2008, Covenant Life Church planted Iglesia Gracia Soberana de Gaithersburg in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Iglesia Gracia Soberana de Gaithersburg is the second Spanish-speaking Sovereign Grace church in the USA. Its pastor is José Mercado.\n\n"}
{"id": "1934110", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1934110", "title": "Spire (mollusc)", "text": "Spire (mollusc)\n\nA spire is a part of the coiled shell of molluscs. The spire consists of all of the whorls except for the body whorl. Each spire whorl represents a rotation of 360°. A spire is part of the shell of a snail, a gastropod mollusc, a gastropod shell, and also the whorls of the shell in ammonites, which are fossil shelled cephalopods.\nIn textbook illustrations of gastropod shells, the tradition (with a few exceptions) is to show the majority of shells with the spire uppermost on the page.\n\nThe spire, when it is not damaged or eroded, includes the protoconch (also called the nuclear whorls or the larval shell), and most of the subsequent teleoconch whorls (also called the postnuclear whorls), which gradually increase in area as they are formed. Thus the spire in most gastropods is pointed, the tip being known as the \"apex\". The word \"spire\" is used, in an analogy to a church spire or rock spire, a high, thin, pinnacle.\n\nThe \"spire angle\" is the angle, as seen from the apex, at which a spire increases in area. It is an angle formed by imaginary lines tangent to the spire.\n\nSome gastropod shells have very high spires (the shell is much higher than wide), some have low spires (the shell is much wider than high), and there are all possible grades between. In a few gastropod families the shells are not helical in their coiling, but instead are planispiral, flat-coiled. In these shells, the spire does not have a raised point, but instead is sunken. \n\nSnails with high spires tend to prefer vertical surfaces while those with low spires prefer horizontal surfaces. This is thought to aid in reducing competition between high and low-spired species in a habitat. Snails with middle-height spires show little preference to surface angle.\n\nGastropod shells that are not spirally coiled (for example shells of limpets) have no columella.\n\nIn some species as high-spired shells become adult the soft parts of the animal cease to occupy the upper parts of the cavity of the shell. The space thus vacated is sometimes filled with solid shell, as in \"Magilus\"; or it is partitioned off, as in \"Vermetus\", \"Euomphalus\", \"Turritella\", Triton or \"Caecum\". The empty apex in these shells is sometimes very thin, and becomes brittle. In some species it breaks away, leaving the shell truncated or decollated. Decollated shells usually have the whorls of the spire closely wound and not increasing much in diameter. A typical example is the decollate snail (\"Rumina decollata\").\n\nThe form of the shell of a gastropod is usually regular in coiling, and is normally a cone curved into a spiral, and descending in a screw-like manner from the apex or initial whorl to the aperture. The shell grows in a regular geometrical progression in its normal pattern, although these modes vary among themselves widely. Thus we have the simple depressed cone of \"Patella\", all aperture and no spire. From it there is every gradation, from the \"Haliotis\", almost equally depressed and broad, the result, however, of a very rapidly enlarging spiral, to the long, many-whorled \"Turritella\" or \"Vermetus\", which is a \"Turritella\" partially unrolled into a simple long tube — the\nopposite of the \"Patella\".\n\n\"See also\" : Gastropod shell#Shape of the shell\n\nIn most spiral shells the spire normally curves to the right, that is to say, placing the shell with its apex turned upward from the observer and its aperture in view : the aperture will be on the right hand side. In others the volutions proceed in the opposite direction with such regularity as to be eminently characteristic of some species and genera (\"Physa\", \"Clausilia\", etc.). However, in certain genera, it is found that species normally dextral will exceptionally produce sinistrally coiled shells, and vice versa. This abnormal growth probably is caused by disturbance of the relations of the embryo with its initial shell.\n"}

It deals with the lives of the three Irish Catholic McMullen brothers from Long Island, New York, over three months, as they grapple with basic ideas and values — love, sex, marriage, religion and family — in the 1990s.\n\nThe film begins with Finbar \"Barry\" McMullen standing at the grave of his recently deceased father, along with his mother, who tells him that she's returning to her native Ireland to be with Finbar O'Shaughnessy (after whom Barry is named), her sweetheart of long ago. She tells Barry that while she gave Barry's father 35 of the best years of her life, she's going to start living life her way with the man she really loves.\n\nJack has purchased their parents' home and lives in it with his wife Molly. Jack is torn between his love for Molly and his lust for Ann, a former romantic interest of Barry's.\n\nBarry and the youngest brother, Pat ask to temporarily move in with Jack, to which he reluctantly agrees. Pat plans to break his engagement to Susan, but becomes depressed when she breaks up with him. After much pleading, Susan decides to take Pat back. Pat then decides to end the relationship for good for Leslie, an auto mechanic. They decide to head out to California together in a classic car that Leslie has been working on.\n\nBarry shows no interest in a long-term relationship, until he meets Audrey, a woman whom he accuses of \"stealing\" an apartment that he was trying to rent for himself. Though things do not go well between them at first, they warm up to one another and start a relationship.\n\nMolly learns of Jack's affair after finding a wrapped condom in his pants as she is cleaning up after him one day. She confronts Jack, but he refuses to discuss it.\n\nJack finally breaks it off for good with Ann. He then returns home determined to rebuild his wounded marriage, but not before paying a visit to his father's grave, promising (in a voice-over) that he will be a better husband to his wife than his father was, pouring a bottle of Irish whiskey over the grave.\n\nBarry decides to move in with Audrey and take their relationship to the next level. The movie ends with all three brothers gathering at the family homestead with a newfound belief in love and a desire to not let the ghosts of the past stand in their way.\n\n\nEdward Burns wrote the screenplay in the spring of 1993 while working as a production assistant for \"Entertainment Tonight\", where he worked for cameraman Dick Fisher, who later produced and edited the film. Burns' own Irish Catholic background fed into the screenplay, and film was mostly shot in Burns' real-life family home, a house in the Valley Stream community of Long Island. Shooting took place on weekends over an eight-month period in New York State.\n\nThe film, which was shot on 16mm film, originally cost only $28,000, essentially the cost of raw stock and processing. Burns saved money by placing an advertisement in Backstage magazine looking for Irish-American actors willing to work for free, though lunch would be provided.\n\nWhen Robert Redford was at the \"Entertainment Tonight\" studios for an interview, Burns approached him at the elevator and gave him a copy of the film, asking Redford to watch it. Redford later extended an invitation to show it at the Sundance Film Festival. The showing led to a distribution deal, which included an additional $200,000 for post production work and to get the rights for the Sarah McLachlan song \"I Will Remember You\", which was added over the end credits.\n\nThe film won the Grand Jury Prize at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival. It was picked up for distribution by 20th Century Fox and grossed over $10 million at the US box office, making it one of the most profitable independent films of that era. According to Tom Rothman, it was also the first film ever released by Fox Searchlight Pictures, which Tom Rothman started for 20th Century Fox, in order to release Independent, Dramedy, Foreign and Arthouse films, despite being in Hollywood. Edward Burns was called \"The New Woody Allen\" and even continued to make Woody Allen-esque films afterwards.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 89% rating based on 36 critics.\n\n\n"}

Usually this term is used in situations where these symmetry-breaking terms are small, so that the symmetry is approximately respected by the theory. An example is the spectral line splitting in the Zeeman effect, due to a magnetic interaction perturbation in the Hamiltonian of the atoms involved.\n\nExplicit symmetry breaking differs from spontaneous symmetry breaking. In the latter, the defining equations respect the symmetry but the ground state (vacuum) of the theory breaks it.\n\nExplicit symmetry breaking is also associated with electromagnetic radiation. A system of accelerated charges results in electromagnetic radiation when the geometric symmetry of the electric field in free space is explicitly broken by the associated electrodynamic structure under time varying excitation of the given system. This is quite evident in an antenna where the electric lines of field curl around or have rotational geometry around the radiating terminals in contrast to linear geometric orientation within a pair of transmission lines which does not radiate even under time varying excitation.\n\n"}

Her rights were ignored by the Hungarian nobility when Sigismund died in 1437 and only her husband was accepted as monarch, with Elizabeth as mere consort.\n\nAlbert died in 1439, leaving Elizabeth a pregnant dowager with two daughters, Anne and Elizabeth. Bohemian nobility proclaimed an \"interregnum\", while King Vladislaus III of Poland was crowned new king of Hungary in May 1440, three months after Queen Elizabeth delivered a son, Ladislaus the Posthumous. She was determined to contend for her patrimony on her son's behalf, which led to a civil war between hers and Vladislaus' supporters. The conflict ended with the queen's death at the age of 33. Vladislaus himself died in battle in 1444, opening the path for Elizabeth's son to be recognized as king of Hungary.\n\nHer real birth date can be calculated by virtue of a letter of King Sigismund to Kéméndi Péter fia János (John, son of Peter Kemendi), Lord-lieutenant of Zala County dated 26 April 1410 (\"sabbato post festum s. Georgii\") at Végles, Hungary (now Vígľaš, Slovakia) and sealed with Queen Barbara's seal, who also stayed there and in which the king informs him about his daughter's birth \"alias circa festum beati Francisci confessoris\". Because this feast falls on 4 October, it must have happened in the previous year, that is, 1409 and in October. Baranyai (1926) argues that the usage of \"circa\" can allow some variations towards September but if it had occurred in September, he would have referred to the feast of Saint Michael which falls on 29 September instead of that of Francis of Assisi. The only remaining question, namely the exact day is educed from the engagement date of his daughter to Archduke Albert which was held on 7 October 1411, Pozsony, Hungary (now Bratislava, Slovakia, Pressburg in German) and probably may have adjusted to a former important event because it belongs to no religious feasts. The birthplace is also inferential and is traced back to the traditional place for the queen's labours that was in Visegrád and which is referred to in her Memoirs by Helene Kottannerin in the case of Queen Elisabeth advanced in pregnancy with Ladislas V in early 1440. In addition, Itinerary of King Sigismund shows that he stayed in Visegrad between 9–19 October 1409. In the end one concludes that her birth in Prague, on 28 February 1409, similarly to the date of 27 November this year which in reality was her christening day, is based on false sources.\n\nElizabeth was born into the powerful House of Luxembourg. Her parents were the 41-year-old King Sigismund of Hungary and his second wife, the 17-year-old Barbara of Cilli. Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić, the rebellious baron with whom Sigismund had recently come to terms, was the infant's godfather. The year after her birth, Elizabeth's father was elected King of the Romans.\n\nAs the king's only child, Elizabeth was seen as \"de facto\" heir presumptive to the throne, or at least as the princess whose eventual marriage would provide a king. In 1411, Sigismund managed to have the Hungarian estates promise that they would recognize Elizabeth's right to the Holy Crown of Hungary and elect her future husband as king –an agreement that would have great consequences after Sigismund's death. Elizabeth's hereditary right was in fact rather slim, as her father had acquired it by marrying his first wife, Queen Mary, from whom Elizabeth was not descended. The same year, Sigismund betrothed Elizabeth to the Habsburg Duke Albert V of Austria, then aged 14.\n\nQueen Barbara was very unpopular among the nobility, who resented her sympathy for the Hussites, forerunners of the Protestant Reformation. In 1418, they accused her of having committed adultery while her husband was attending the Council of Constance. The resulting strain in the royal marriage led to the queen's banishment and confinement, first in Várad and subsequently in Szakolca, between 1418 and 1419. The fact that Elizabeth accompanied her mother into the exile and presumably endured the same harsh treatment despite being recognized as heiress to the throne suggests that Sigismund may have doubted her paternity during that period. Nevertheless, Sigismund simultaneously negotiated her marriage to the Habsburg Duke Albert V of Austria. The Habsburgs, Sigismund's long-standing friends and allies, evidently did not question Elizabeth's legitimacy or, at least, were not deterred by the accusations made against her mother. Sigismund reconciled with Barbara in 1419 and Elizabeth returned to his favour along with her mother. The same year, he inherited the Bohemian crown from his elder brother, King Wenceslaus IV.\n\nOn 28 September 1421, the enduring friendship between King Sigismund and the House of Habsburg culminated in a marriage treaty signed in Vienna. The treaty confirmed Elizabeth's status as heiress presumptive of both Hungary and Bohemia, but only for as long as she remained Sigismund's only child. It stipulated that the birth of another daughter would leave Elizabeth with the right to choose one of her father's kingdoms, while the younger sister would inherit the other. Should she gain a brother, however, she would be deprived of both crowns in his favour. The Margraviate of Moravia was ceded to Albert as Elizabeth's dowry. The treaty was controversial in both Hungary and Bohemia, as the nobility of both countries claimed the right to elect their monarch, even though their choice was normally the heir-in-blood.\n\nElizabeth formally married Albert in a splendid ceremony held on 19 April 1422 in Vienna. Elizabeth, now duchess of Austria, moved to the Viennese court of her husband. The papal dispensation for the marriage, necessary due to the couple's common descent from Wenceslaus II of Bohemia and Judith of Habsburg, was not sought until 1431, but was easily granted by Eugene IV.\n\nThe couple's first child, a daughter named Anne, was born in 1432. The French travel writer Bertrandon de la Broquière noted that \"the Duchess, a tall, handsome woman, daughter to the Emperor, and heiress after him to the kingdoms of Hungary and Bohemia and their dependencies\", gave birth to a daughter, \"which had occasioned festivals and tournaments that were the more numerously attended because hitherto she had not had any children.\" In 1435, Elizabeth delivered a son, George, who died within three hours. The next birth was that of another daughter, Elizabeth, in 1436.\n\nBy the end of 1437, Elizabeth's aging father was gravely ill. Realising that his death was imminent, he summoned Elizabeth and Albert to Znojmo and convened a meeting of the Bohemian nobility, who accepted the couple as his heirs at his request but reserved the right of a formal election. He died on 9 December. After his burial, Elizabeth and Albert travelled to Pressburg to meet with the Hungarian magnates. They requested that the couple reside in Hungary and that the kingdom's border with Austria remain unaltered. Afterwards, the Diet resolved that Albert, who was elected due to being Elizabeth's husband, should govern only \"with her consent and approval\". The couple accepted the conditions on 18 December and were elected king and queen of Hungary. Elizabeth later asserted that her sovereignty derived not only from her father's will, but also from the will of the people.\n\nA dispute immediately arose as to who was entitled to crown Elizabeth; the bishop of Veszprém claimed the right to crown Hungarian queens consort, but the archbishop of Esztergom argued that Elizabeth was a queen regnant and that he should therefore crown both her and Albert. The archbishop, probably bribed, eventually yielded and signed a deed resigning the function to the bishop, but only on that occasion. The couple's coronation took place at Székesfehérvár Basilica on 1 January 1438.\n\nIn March 1438, the Imperial Diet elected Albert as Sigismund's successor on the German throne and Elizabeth consequently became queen of the Romans. Despite the Hussite attempts to enthrone Casimir of Poland, the Bohemian election in May ended in the couple's favour. Albert was crowned in June, but Elizabeth did not travel to Prague to take part in the ritual and spent the following summer governing Hungary.\n\nAt the death of her husband, she took control of Hungary as regent. She was pregnant, and she was convinced the child was a son. She prepared for the election of the next monarch of Hungary and formed a political party of followers. Among her followers were her mother's family Cilli, Ulrich II, Count of Celje, the greatest fief holder in Hungary, the Szécsis, the Garays and the cities, and appointed followers to the posts of arch bishop and governor of the royal castle. By 1440, Elisabeth was the de facto ruling monarch of Hungary, and her orders were respected and carried out, though she was not yet elected by the council and confirmed as such. On 1 January 1440, the Hungarian council gathered to elect a monarch. The decision was, that because of the threats from the Ottoman Empire, Elisabeth could not be elected as monarch, but a warlord and a military leader was needed. There were also suggestions that Elisabeth should marry the male elected to be monarch. In the end, Vladislaus of Poland was elected King of Hungary.\n\nElisabeth officially accepted the decision, but shortly afterward, she left Buda with her followers. On 15 May, she had her son crowned King of Hungary in Székesfehérvár with Holy Crown stolen by Helene Kottannerin from the castle of Visegrád. On 17 July Vladislaus of Poland was crowned King of Hungary in Székesfehérvár without Holy Crown. Northern Hungary supported Elisabeth, and she attacked Buda with an army led by John Jiskra, but was defeated. Elisabeth left her two younger children in the care of Emperor Frederick III and financed the civil war in Austria. In 1442, a negotiation was issued by Cardinal Cesarini in Győr. Elisabeth and Vladislaus met and exchanged gifts. Vladislaus gave Elisabeth fur. Shortly afterward, Elisabeth died. She was rumoured to have been poisoned.\n\nHer only son Ladislas V the Posthumous of Austria, king of Bohemia and Hungary (born 1440) died without issue, leaving the remaining kingdoms of the family to be succeeded by elected rulers.\n\nHer daughters Anna, Duchess of Thuringia (1432–1462), and Elisabeth, Queen of Poland (1437–1505), continued the family which afterwards regained some of these kingdoms.\n\nElisabeth was not the daughter of her father's first wife Mary of Hungary, and thus not a descended from Angevin kings of Hungary. However, she in many ways descended from the old Árpád kings of Hungary.\n\nHer paternal grandparents were Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and Elisabeth of Pomerania. Her maternal grandfather was Count Herman II of Celje , whose parents were the Styrian magnate Hermann I of Celje and Catherine of Bosnia (sister of the Hungarian queen Elizabeth of Bosnia). In right of the paternal grandparents, she was, through Emperor Charles, an heiress of Bohemia, and through Elisabeth of Pomerania, an heiress of Poland, of its Kujavian Piast branch of kings. Thus, she was a leading claimant to several Slavic kingdoms and principalities.\n\nShe was also a descendant of Árpád kings of Hungary, through her great-grandmother Elisabeth of Bohemia (1292–1330), who herself was granddaughter of Kunguta Rostislavna of Halicia, whose mother Anna was a daughter of King Bela IV of Hungary. Admittedly, this was not a very close Hungarian connection, but all the other \"extant\" descendants of Árpáds were approximately as distant at that time.\nAdditionally, she descended from Ottokar I of Bohemia's second wife Constance of Hungary, daughter of Bela III of Hungary.\n\n\n"}

It is located east of the town of Verdalsøra and about southeast of the village of Forbregd/Lein. The village is mainly known as the site of the Battle of Stiklestad on 29 July 1030. Stiklestad Church is located in the village and it is assumed to have been erected on the exact spot where King Olaf II Haraldsson fell in the battle. The king was buried in Nidaros (Trondheim), canonised there on 3 August 1031, and later enshrined in Nidaros Cathedral. Following the Lutheran reformation of 1537 the saint's remains were removed and their precise resting-place has been unknown since 1568.\n\nThe Old Norse form of the name is \"Stiklarstaðir\". The first element is the genitive of a word \"stikl\" and the last element is \"staðir\" which means \"farm\". The word \"stikl\" might have been derived from the verb \"stikla\" which means \"to jump\", and this might have been the name of a nearby brook.\n\nIn the 13th century Gesta Danorum, or \"The History of the Danes,\" Saxo Grammaticus recorded that the town was named after Stikla, a shield-maiden who was most famous for raiding with the Viking captain Rusla (Rusla was known as \"The Red Maiden\" for her brutal raids on Irish ships.) Stikla would have settled in the area at some point after her participation in the Battle of Clontarf in 1014.\n\nGiven King Olav II’s role in the spread of Christianity in Norway, Stiklestad has been a significant site in Norwegian national culture since the 1030 battle. There has been an Olav memorial there since medieval times.\n\nBetween 1934 and 1944 Vidkun Quisling’s Nationalist Nasjonal Samling party held a number of rallies at Stiklestad, in an attempt to link the party to Norway’s historic past. A special Nasjonal Samling monument was inaugurated there in July 1944, before being demolished a year later after the fall of Quisling's government.\nSince 1954 an annual the Saint Olav Drama, a re-enactment of the days leading up to the battle of 1030, has taken place at a specially built amphitheatre at Stiklestad. \n\nIn 1995 a Parliamentary decree established (\"Stiklestad Nasjonale Kultursenter\") at Stiklestad to promote the story and heritage of Saint Olaf, including the annual Saint Olav Drama. There is also a folk museum, that includes a medieval farm, and a hotel housed in the same building as the Culture Centre.\n\n\n"}

Cartelyou was a brick mason and a World War II veteran, while Juanita was a secretary in the Office of Public Housing. Cartelyou died in 1976 from leukemia. LaNier was the eldest of three girls. She was inspired by Rosa Parks when she refused to give up her seat in the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott.\n\nLaNier first attended Dunbar Junior High School, a segregated school in Little Rock. However, after graduating, she volunteered to be one of the first African-Americans to attend Central High School. She married Ira (Ike) LaNier in 1968 with whom she had two children, Whitney and Brooke. She has two grandchildren, a granddaughter and a grandson. She currently resides in Englewood, Colorado.\n\nLaNier learned about the chance to go to Central High School by her homeroom teacher at her junior high. Her teacher asked if anyone was interested in going to Central, and LaNier popped out of her seat and registered to go to the new school. Her parents didn’t know she had been enrolled until the registration card showed up in the mail that July.\n\nFebruary 9, 1960, LaNier's home was bombed. Two sticks of dynamite were placed on her home, it removed brick and destroyed 3 windows, and it could be heard from two miles away.

The integration followed the Brown v. Board of Education decision which required public schools to be desegregated.\n\nMinnijean Brown-Trickey was born to Mary and Jane Brown in Little Rock, AR. Willie worked as an independent mason and a landscaping contractor while Imogene was a homemaker and a nurses aide. Minnijean was the eldest of four siblings.\n\nBrown-Trickey began her high school career in 1956 at Horace Mann, an all-black school located in Little Rock, AR. She later transferred to Little Rock Central High School in 1957 following the Brown v. Board of Education decision. Minnijean was expelled from Central and finished her high school education in New York at the New Lincoln School in Manhattan.\n\nIn September of 1957, with the help of Daisy Bates, a prominent civil rights activist in Central Arkansas, Minnijean Brown-Trickey set out to integrate Little Rock Central High School alongside eight other African American students. The students originally attempted to enter the school on September 4, 1957, but were stopped by the Arkansas National Guard called in by Governor Orval Faubus. In response, President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent 1,200 U.S. paratroopers from the 101st Airborne Division to assist the Little Rock Nine in entering the school. On September 25, 1957, Brown-Trickey along with the other eight students desegregated Little Rock Central High School.\n\nDespite the troops being stationed at the high school throughout the '57-'58 school year, the nine students were physically and verbally harassed by their classmates. Brown-Trickey was the first suspended out of the Little Rock Nine and she was the only one to be expelled. Her suspension was the result of an incident which took place on December 17, 1957. While walking through the crowded cafeteria during lunch, Brown-Trickey was harassed and ended up dropping her lunch tray and spilling chili on two male students. She was suspended from school for six days. Following her suspension, Minnijean came back to school and a white student spilled soup on her. He was only suspended for two days.Later, in February, a group of girls threw a purse filled with combination locks at Minnijean. She responded by calling the girls \"white trash\" and was immediately expelled. After her expulsion, students at Central passed a note around which stated, \"One down, eight to go.\"\n\nFollowing the incident, Brown-Trickey moved to New York and lived with Drs. Kenneth B. and Mamie Clark. The Clark's were African American psychologists who helped with the argument presented by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in the Brown v. Board of Education case.\n\nBrown-Trickey attended the New Lincoln School in Manhattan for 11th and 12th grade.\n\nMinnijean Browns attended Southern Illinois University where she majored in journalism. She lived in Canada for a number of years in the 1980s and 1990s, where she studied social work at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario, and later completing a Master of Social Work degree at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario. Eventually, Brown-Trickey moved back to America and worked for the Clinton Administration in 1999 through 2001 as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Workforce Diversity at the Department of the Interior.\n\nToday, Minnijean continues to speak out for minority rights as well as for the environment. She has spoken in 49 states as well as several countries including Canada, England, and South Africa. The speaking event that Brown-Trickey values the most was speaking at an award ceremony for Malala Yousafzai.\n\nBrown-Trickey has been the recipient of many awards including a Lifetime Achievement Tribute by the Canadian Race Relations Foundation, the International Wolf Award, the Spingarn Medal, and an award from the W.E.B. DuBois Institute.Under the Clinton administration, Brown-Trickey received the Congressional Gold Medal in 1999 alongside the other members of the Little Rock Nine.\n\nIn 1967, Minnijean Brown married Roy Trickey. The couple had six children before divorcing in the 1980s. One of her daughters, Spirit Trickey, worked for the Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site in Little Rock, AR for 10 years. Growing up, Spirit and her siblings knew very little about their mother's involvement with civil rights. Minnijean didn't enjoy speaking about her time at Central, and it took 30 years for her to discuss the issue with her children. While Spirit no longer works for the Historic Site, she is still involved with the Little Rock Nine and their history. This includes coordinating her mother's speaking events and helping her write a memoir.\n\nBrown-Trickey has been depicted in two made-for-television movies about the Little Rock Nine. She was portrayed by Regina Taylor in the 1981 CBS movie \"Crisis at Central High\", and by Monica Calhoun in the 1993 Disney Channel movie \"The Ernest Green Story\". A documentary film about Brown-Trickey entitled \"Journey to Little Rock: The Untold Story of Minnijean Brown Trickey\" (2002) was produced by North-East Pictures in Ottawa, where Brown-Trickey lived during the 1990s. \n\n"}

The English lyrics were written by Carl Sigman in 1953.\n\nSigman originally wrote it as a religious-themed song, \"Answer Me\" (in which the first line reads \"Answer me, Lord above\"), as a question posed to God about why the singer has lost his lover. This version of the song became a joint number 1 hit for both Frankie Laine and David Whitfield in the United Kingdom in November 1953, the only time in UK chart history that two versions of the same song tied at the top. However, the BBC banned the song because of its \"religious\" lyrics, and Sigman rewrote them to address the lost lover directly, under the title \"Answer Me, My Love\". Whitfield then re-recorded the number with the new lyrics so as to get BBC air-plays. Both his versions have appeared on CD. Laine went back into the studios of Columbia Records and recorded \"Answer Me, My Love\", which was released in the UK but failed to overtake the original; many considered that this was due to the poor quality of the backing which lacked the \"atmosphere\" of the original Paul Weston arrangement.\n\nThe best-selling version of the song was recorded by Nat King Cole in 1954. The recording was released by Capitol Records as catalog number 2687.

This method relies on the use of ample live rock (rock with live marine organisms and bacteria on or in it). The theory is that aerobic bacteria covering the surface of the porous live rock and sand convert harmful ammonia (from fish and invertebrate waste) into nitrites, then nitrates, which are much less harmful to the tank's inhabitants. Through the process of diffusion, the nitrates move deep within the rock where they are converted by anaerobic bacteria to free nitrogen gas. Left over nitrates are removed through regular partial water changes, or with algal filtration such as an algae scrubber. As an added measure, a protein skimmer is used to remove some of the dissolved organic compounds before they break down into ammonia, although skimmers do not remove ammonia from fish urea.\n\nThe typical rule of thumb is to use from 1-2 lb (0.45 to 0.9 kg) of live rock per gallon (US) (3.7 liters) of aquarium water depending on the density of the rock – or filling the tank up 2/3 of the way to the top. The benefit of using live rock is fourfold: First, live rock acts as a biological filter, adding beneficial bacteria. Secondly, it introduces an abundance of marine life into the aquarium that many fish, invertebrates and corals use for food. Thirdly, it provides a natural reef appearance with ample places to locate corals. Lastly, live rock will also help balance and stabilize pH in the aquarium.\n\nCalcium, alkalinity and other trace elements which are consumed by corals are replaced through water changes (using natural seawater or a quality synthetic salt mix) or the use of a calcium reactor, kalkwasser (calcium water – calcium hydroxide mixed with pure water) or a balanced two-part solution.\n\n"}

Gastropods whose shells have varices are primarily families and species within the taxonomic groups Littorinimorpha and Neogastropoda.\n\nThe varix is a thickened axial ridge, a subcylindrical protrusion, in the shell which exists in some families of marine gastropods. It is an important shell character in generic classification. A varix is located at intervals around the whorl, and is formed by considerable thickening of the outer lip during a resting stage in the growth of the shell. In other words, in gastropods whose shells have varices, the shells are characterised by episodic growth - the shell grows in spurts, and during the resting phase the varix forms.\n\nIn many gastropod whose shells have varices, for example the Cassinae, the varix is essentially merely a thickening and swelling of the shell at that point. But in some genera within the family Muricidae, such as \"Chicoreus\", \"Hexaplex\", \"Pteropurpura\" and \"Pterynotus\", and also within the genus \"Biplex\", of the family Ranellidae, the varices are characterised by elaborate ruffles, frills or lamellae.

His residence was in Sirmium (today Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia). He was described in Byzantine sources as: \"\"ruler of Syrmia and brother of Nestongos\"\" ().\n\nVery little is known about him. Even his name may be simply a corruption of the name of Sirmium, added in the text of John Skylitzes in a later commentary. He had a brother, Nestongos, about whom nothing further is known, but who may have been an ancestor of the Nestongos aristocratic family that appears in Byzantium in the 11th–14th centuries.\n\nFollowing the death of the Bulgarian Tsar Ivan Vladislav in early 1018, Bulgarian resistance against the Byzantine emperor Basil II collapsed. Basil therefore sent his generals to extend his control over the local lords of the northern and western Balkans. While most of them submitted and recognized the emperor's authority, Sermon refused. Consequently, the local Byzantine governor, Constantine Diogenes invited Sermon to a meeting at the estuary of the river Sava in the Danube, where each would only be accompanied by three attendants. Diogenes had hidden his sword in the folds of his clothes, and struck Sermon down. He then marched his army into Sirmium, taking possession of the town. Sermon's wife was sent as a captive to Constantinople, where she married a senior Byzantine official.\n\nThree golden coins produced by Sermon have been found near Novi Sad, in one vineyard in Petrovaradin, which means that this area was also under Sermon's rule.

For instance, the individual words 'brother' and 'sister' may in some languages be agglomerated to 'brothersister' to express \"siblings\". The grammatical number of such constructs is often plural or dual. \n\nThe term dvandva was borrowed from Sanskrit, a language in which these compounds are common. Dvandvas also exist in Avestan, the Old Iranian language related to Sanskrit, as well as in numerous Indo-Aryan languages descended from the Prakrits. Several far-eastern languages such as Chinese, Japanese, Atong (a Tibeto-Burman language of India and Bangladesh) and Korean also have dvandvas. Dvandvas may also be found occasionally in European languages, but are relatively rare.\n\nExamples include:\n\n\"Dvandva\"s should not be confused with agglutination, which also concatenates words but is a different process.\n\nThere are two or three kinds of dvandva compounds in Sanskrit, depending on classification.\n\nThe first, and most common kind, the \"itaretara (<\"itara-itara\") dvandva\", is an enumerative compound word, the meaning of which refers to all its constituent members. The resultant compound word is in the dual or plural depending on the total number of described individuals. It takes the gender of the final member in the compound construction. Examples:\n\nCompare Greek Αβαρόσλαβοι \"the Avars and the Slavs (two distinct tribes acting as a unit)\", similarly with case and number marking displayed only on the last part of the compound, the first having the form of the word root)\n\nItaretaras formed from two kinship terms behave differently, in that the first word is not in the compound form but in the nominative (singular). \n\nThe second, rarer kind is called samāhāra dvandva and is a collective compound word, the meaning of which refers to the collection of its constituent members. The resultant compound word is in the singular number and is always neuter in gender. Examples:\n\nCompare Modern Greek ανδρόγυνο \"husband and wife\" or μαχαιροπίρουνο \"cutlery\" (literally \"knife-forks\"), similarly always in the neuter singular (plural marking would refer to several couples or cutlery sets).\n\nAccording to some grammarians, there is a third kind called \"ekaśeṣa dvandva\" \"residual compound\".

The goal of little Higgs models is to use the spontaneous breaking of such approximate global symmetries to stabilize the mass of the Higgs boson(s) responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking.\n\nThe little Higgs models predict a naturally-light Higgs particle.\n\nThe main idea behind the little Higgs models is that the one-loop contribution to the tachyonic Higgs boson mass coming from the top quark cancels. The simplified reason for that cancellation is that a loop's contribution is proportional to the coupling constant of one of the SU(2) groups. Because of the symmetries in the theory, the contributions cancel until there is a two-loop contribution involving both groups. This restricts the Higgs boson mass for about one order of magnitude, which is good enough to evade many of the precision electroweak constraints.\n\nLittle Higgs theories were an outgrowth of dimensional deconstruction: In these theories, the gauge group has the form of a direct product of several copies of the same factor, for example SU(2) × SU(2). Each SU(2) factor may be visualized as the SU(2) group living at a particular point along an additional dimension of space. Consequently, many virtues of extra-dimensional theories are reproduced even though the little Higgs theory is 3+1 dimensional.\n\nAlthough the idea was first suggested in the 1970s, a viable model was only constructed by Arkani-Hamed, Cohen, and Georgi in 2001. The idea was explored further by Arkani-Hamed, Cohen, Gregoire, and Wacker in 2002. Also in 2002, several other papers appeared that refined the ideas of little Higgs theories, notably the \"Littlest Higgs\" by Arkani-Hamed, Cohen, Katz, and Nelson.\n"}

The thirty 1,620-ton \"Benson\"-class destroyers were built in two groups. The first six were authorized in fiscal year 1938 (FY38) and laid down at Bethlehem Steel, Quincy, Massachusetts and three naval shipyards. The remaining 24 “repeat \"Benson\"s” were authorized in 1940–42 and built at four Bethlehem Steel yards. They were laid down after the first group was commissioned. These plus the “repeat \"Livermore\"s” (also known as \"repeat \"Gleaves\"es\") were also known at the time as the \"Bristol\" class. During World War II the \"Benson\"s were usually combined with the \"Livermore\"s (more correctly the \"Gleaves\" class) as the \"Benson\"-\"Livermore\" class; this persisted in references until at least the 1960s. In some references both classes are combined and called the \"Benson\" class. The \"Benson\"- and \"Gleaves\"-class destroyers were the backbone of the pre-war Neutrality Patrols and brought the action to the enemy by participating in every major campaign of the war.\n\nThe lead ship of the class was named after William Shepherd Benson, a graduate of the Naval Academy in 1877. He commanded , , , and the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Benson was appointed first Chief of Naval Operations in 1915 and then served as CNO until he retired 25 September 1919. He died in Washington, D.C., 20 May 1932.\n\nThe \"Benson\"s were originally envisioned as a single class of 24 ships, the first eight of which were ordered in fiscal year 1938 (FY38). Six of these were designed by Bethlehem Shipbuilding, to be built at a Bethlehem yard and several naval shipyards, and two were designed by Gibbs & Cox, to be built at Bath Iron Works. All were to have steam (references vary) superheated to , with cruising turbines and double-reduction gearing to maximize fuel efficiency. After contract award, Bethlehem requested that their design be modified to use less-complex single-reduction gears and no cruising turbines. Bethlehem claimed they could achieve comparable fuel efficiency with the simpler machinery. This request was granted, but FY39 and FY40 ships, beginning with , would use the more complex machinery. So the class was known through World War II as the \"Benson\"-\"Livermore\" class, and this name persisted in many references until at least the 1960s. In the spring of 1938 the Navy's Bureau of Steam Engineering requested that the FY39 and FY40 ships be modified for superheat. It proved possible for Bath to build their two FY38 ships, \"Gleaves\" and \"Niblack\", to the new design. \"Gleaves\" was completed prior to \"Livermore\" and had a lower hull number, thus the class name is more correctly the \"Benson\"-\"Gleaves\" class.\n\nThe only external difference between the \"Benson\" and \"Gleaves\" classes was the shape of the stacks; the \"Benson\"s' were flat-sided and the \"Gleaves\"es' were round.\n\nAfter the Fall of France in 1940 a rapid expansion of the Navy was envisioned. To fill the gap until the s would be ready for service, an additional 72 \"repeat\" \"Benson\"- and \"Gleaves\"-class ships were ordered in FY41 and FY42. 24 repeat \"Benson\"s were built by several Bethlehem yards, while an additional 48 repeat \"Gleaves\"es were built by various other builders. These were initially called the \"Bristol\" class after , a repeat \"Gleaves\" and the first of these to be completed, although the machinery of the repeat \"Benson\"s was different from the repeat \"Gleaves\"es. The repeat ships were ordered with reduced torpedo and gun armament and increased anti-submarine and light anti-aircraft armament.\n\nIn some references the \"Benson\" and \"Gleaves\" classes are combined as the \"Benson\" class.\n\nThe \"Benson\" class was designed as an improved version of the with two stacks and a new \"echeloned\" machinery arrangement that featured alternating boiler and engine rooms, designed to give the ships a better chance at surviving torpedo damage. Loss of one compartment, or even two adjacent compartments, would no longer disable the entire propulsion system. They also introduced quintuple torpedo tube mounts. Their scantlings, or framing dimensions, were increased to carry the weight of the new machinery. This increased the ships' displacement by about sixty tons, to 1620 tons standard displacement.\n\nThe \"Benson\"s were all completed with \"M\"-type boilers, steam (references vary) superheated to , single-reduction gearing, and no cruising turbines. The main steam turbines were designed and built by Bethlehem Steel.\n\nThe class was completed with four or five dual purpose guns (anti-surface and anti-aircraft (AA)), controlled by a Mark 37 Gun Fire Control System as in the previous \"Sims\" class. The introduction of two centerline quintuple torpedo tube mounts in this class was a significant improvement and was continued in subsequent World War II classes. This allowed a broadside of ten tubes with savings in space and weight compared to previous classes, which had twelve or sixteen tubes and an eight-tube broadside. However, most of the \"Benson\"s spent most of the war with only five torpedo tubes equipped in favor of greater light anti-aircraft armament. This varied considerably in different ships as the war went on; for example, the specified pair of twin guns were not widely available until mid-1942 and a quadruple machine cannon mount and a gun were temporarily substituted. In 1945 twelve ships (DD-600-601, 603-604, 608, 610, and DD-612-617) were modified for maximum light AA armament as an anti-\"kamikaze\" measure, with four 5-inch guns, no torpedo tubes, twelve 40 mm guns in two quad and two twin mounts and four 20 mm guns in two twin mounts. The first six ships landed a torpedo tube mount early in the war while on Atlantic service, but as they were transferred to the Pacific in early 1945 they were re-equipped with the torpedoes at the cost of a 5-inch gun. Photographs indicate that, as with most pre-1942 destroyers, the initial anti-submarine armament of two depth charge tracks was augmented with four or six K-gun depth charge throwers in 1941-42 on most ships.\n\nThe first six ships of the class began their careers on Neutrality Patrols, and after the attack on Pearl Harbor and the US entry into World War II continued to serve in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, supporting operations in North Africa, Italy, and southern France until transferred to the Pacific in early 1945. Several of the remaining ships spent the entire war in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. Others served entirely in the Pacific, at first in the Solomon Islands or Aleutians and later in other campaigns. Three were lost in the war; two in the Pacific and one in the Mediterranean. A fourth lost the bow section but was rebuilt and returned to service. After the war the survivors were decommissioned and placed in the Reserve Fleet in 1946-47; one was transferred to Italy and two were transferred to Taiwan in the 1950s. Modernization was considered in the 1950s but not implemented except on the transferred ships. The remainder were scrapped or otherwise disposed of in the late 60s and early 70s.\n\nUSS \"Laffey\" and USS \"Barton\" were lost at the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on 13 November 1942; USS \"Lansdale\" was lost to air attack in the Mediterranean Sea on 20 April 1944. Additionally, the bow section of USS \"Murphy\" was cut off in a collision with the tanker SS \"Bulkoil \" from New York on 21 October 1943 and sank with the loss of 38 crew. The rest of the ship was saved and was rebuilt and returned to service; thus \"Murphy\" was not officially considered lost.\n\nUSS \"Laffey\" received a Presidential Unit Citation for her role in the Battle of Guadalcanal. USS \"Bailey\" received a Navy Unit Commendation for her service in the Battle of the Komandorski Islands, 26 March 1943. Also, USS \"Hilary P. Jones\" received a Navy Unit Commendation for her actions in the final operations in the Mediterranean Sea in September 1944.\n\n\n\n"}

He was educated at Eton.\n\nBreadalbane sat as Member of Parliament for Okehampton from 1820 to 1826 and for Perthshire from 1832 to 1834. The latter year he succeeded his father as second Marquess of Breadalbane and entered the House of Lords. In 1848 he was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Lord Chamberlain of the Household by Lord John Russell, a post he held until the government fell in 1852. He held the same office under Lord Aberdeen between 1853 and 1855 and under Lord Palmerston between 1855 and 1858.\n\nA freemason, Breadalbane was Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Scotland between 1824 and 1826. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1834 and made a Knight of the Thistle in 1838. The following year he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Argyllshire, a post he held until his death. In 1842 he entertained Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort at Taymouth Castle. He was a supporter of the Free Church of Scotland during the Disruption of 1843.\n\nBreadalbane was also Rector of the University of Glasgow between 1840 and 1842 and of Marischal College, Aberdeen, between 1843 and 1845, President of the Society of Antiquaries between 1844 and 1862 and Governor of the Bank of Scotland between 1861 and 1862. In 1861 he was sent on a special diplomatic mission to Berlin for the investiture of King William I in the Order of the Garter. He was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Black Eagle of Prussia at the same time.\n\nLord Breadalbane married Lady Elizabeth (\"Eliza\"), daughter of George Baillie and sister of George Baillie-Hamilton, 10th Earl of Haddington, in 1821. They had no children. She was a Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Victoria. She died in Mayfair, London, on 28 August 1861, aged 58. Lord Breadalbane survived her by just over a year and died at Lausanne, Switzerland, on 8 November 1862, aged 66. On his death the barony of Breadalbane, earldom of Ormelie and marquessate of Breadalbane became extinct. He was succeeded in the lordship of Glenorchy, viscountcy of Tay and Paintland and earldom of Breadalbane and Holland by his distant relative and namesake, John Campbell.

In 1935–1936, he underwent primary pilot training at Randolph Field and was commissioned in the United States Army Air Corps.\n\nAfter the start of the Spanish Civil War, Baumler resigned his commission and offered his services to the Republican side. He went to Spain and served there from December 27, 1936, on a contract that promised him a salary of $1,500 a month plus $1,000 for each aircraft he shot down. In February 1937, he was assigned to the Escuadrilla Kosakov fighter unit under Russian command, flying a biplane Polikarpov I-15 \"Chato\". In 1937, he flew many combat missions against the Nationalists, generally dueling against German and Italian aircraft. On March 16, he was credited with his first victory, over an Italian Fiat CR.32 fighter, in a team with A. Zaitsev. On March 20, he was credited with another CR.32, 10 km southeast of Brihuega, as his first individual kill. On April 17, he claimed a German Heinkel He 51 fighter from the Legion Condor over Teruel, and with a second He-51 credited as probably shot down.\nIn late May 1937, Baumler was assigned to the 1st Escuadrilla de Moscas unit, commanded by the Russian Ivan Lakyeyev, flying a faster Polikarpov I-16 \"Mosca\" fighter. On June 2, he claimed another CR.32 in the Segovia area, and on June 14 another over Huesca. On July 8, he probably shot down his last CR.32. He became a close friend of another American volunteer pilot flying for the Spanish Republic, Frank Tinker, who was posted to this squadron after having fought successfully with the 'Lacalle Squadron'. Baumler flew his last missions on July 15, then returned to the United States in August.\n\nIn total, he was credited with shooting down four enemy planes individually and the fifth as a team victory (sometimes counted as 0.5), and with two probables.\n\nIn 1938, Baumler rejoined the U.S. Army as a second lieutenant, but in 1941 he resigned his commission again to join the American Volunteer Group (\"Flying Tigers\") then training in Burma. He was however refused a passport due to his Spanish combat. He returned to the U.S. Army, and in December was assigned to the U.S. Military Mission in China, probably with the expectation that he would serve as AMISSCA's liaison to the AVG, which was in need of experienced staff officers. He flew east on a Pan Am Clipper flying boat that was carrying tires and spare parts for the AVG fighter planes. The cargo was dumped, and Baumler and the aircraft returned after it was strafed at Wake Island on the morning of December 7, 1941 – the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nIn February 1942, Baumler served in the 45th Pursuit Squadron, and in May he was sent to China as a U.S. Army captain. He was credited with two aerial victories, on June 3 and 22, though these cannot be confirmed, and the first is probably erroneous.\nFrom July 4, 1942, he served in the successor of the Flying Tigers, the 75th Fighter Squadron of the 23rd Fighter Group as a pilot and as squadron adjutant under Major David Lee \"Tex\" Hill. Flying P-40E fighters, he was credited with four or five further Japanese aircraft from July to September 1942, his last victories. From December 11, 1942, to February 18, 1943, he commanded the 74th FS. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Medal, and was promoted to major. He seems to have been the first American pilot credited with destroying aircraft of all three Axis Powers.\n\nThe end of the war resulted in the rapid demobilization of the Air Force and Baumler, lacking a college degree and with a history of drinking problems and former association with the Soviets, was turned down for a regular commission, and accepted a permanent rank of master sergeant in order to remain in the service. In the immediate postwar period, he served at Gander Air Force Base in Newfoundland.\n\nDuring the Korean War, he served as a Ground Controlled Approach (GCA) operator and was selected as the controller to direct the landing of General (and President-Elect) Dwight D. Eisenhower's plane when he made his famous visit to Korea. It is said that during the Korean War he was responsible for a radar interception unit and from the way some Migs were manoeuvering he identified some of the Russian pilots as his former wingmen in Spain. He used to refer to them, laughingly, as 'My Boys'.\n\nBaumler's final duty station was Perrin Air Force Base in Texas, where he met and married Erma Loraine Northern of Telephone, Texas. He separated from the Air Force in September 1965 and was placed on the retired list at his reserve rank of major based on his combat decorations.\n\nBaumler died on August 2, 1973, at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Waco, Texas and was buried in Georgetown Cemetery, outside of Pottsboro, Texas.\n\n\n"}

The difference between the three is their level of focus—the motions recorded in BasicMOST are on the level of tens of TMUs, while MiniMOST uses individual TMUs and MaxiMOST uses hundreds of TMUs. This allows for a variety of applications—MiniMOST is commonly used for short (less than about a minute), repetitive cycles, and MaxiMOST for longer (more than several minutes), non-repetitive operations. BasicMost is in the position between them, and can be used accurately for operations ranging from less than a minute to about ten minutes.\n\nAnother variation of MOST is known as AdminMOST. Originally developed and released under the name ClericalMOST in the 1970s, it was recently updated to include modern administrative tasks and renamed. It is on the same level of focus as BasicMOST.\n\nUp until 16bit programs stopped working with Windows, it was possible to use AutoMOST. AutoMOST was a knowledge based system employing decision trees. Developers created logic trees. These trees could then be used by non IE trained operators to generate Standard Times. The user answered a series of logic questions to route the logic and made inputs (number of parts fitted etc.). As they made their way through the tree, based on their route and inputs, AutoMOST would be gathering sub operation data to collate into the final time for the activity being measured. AutoMOST was able to pull in sub operation data from any of the base versions of MOST (Mini, Maxi or Basic)\n\n"}

Legislation generally only refers to \"the Secretary of State\" without specifying which one; by virtue of the Interpretation Act 1978 this phrase means \"one of Her Majesty’s Principal Secretaries of State\". These positions can be created without primary legislation, nowadays at the behest of the Prime Minister.\n\nIn the Middle Ages the kings of England were attended by a cleric called the \"King's Clerk\" and later \"King’s Secretary\", who dealt with their official correspondence. Until the reign of Henry VIII, there was usually only one secretary, but under him a second appeared as the administrative state expanded. In the reign of Elizabeth I (1558–1603) these aristocratic men gained the title \"Secretary of State\". With Cabinet government after 1688, the Secretaries of State took on higher duties. Their posts came to be known as the Secretary of State for the Northern Department and the Secretary of State for the Southern Department. Both dealt with home affairs, but they divided foreign affairs, so that one dealt with the Protestant states of northern Europe and the other with the Roman Catholic states of southern Europe. The Secretary of State for the Southern Department ranked above his counterpart for the Northern Department.\n\nIn 1708, after Union with Scotland, a Secretary of State for Scotland was appointed, but the third secretaryship disappeared from 1742 until 1768, when a newly re-instituted third secretary began to take charge of the increasing administrative work of the British Empire. In 1782 came the new posts of Home Secretary, dealing with home affairs, and Foreign Secretary, dealing with foreign relations. The third secretary again disappeared, and the charge of the colonies was transferred to the Home Secretary. However, owing to the War of the First Coalition with France in 1794, a third secretary re-appeared to superintend the activities of the War Department. Seven years later, the colonial business became attached to his Department. In 1854, a fourth secretary of state gained exclusive charge of the War Department, and in 1858 a fifth secretary (for India) began duties.\n\nThese five secretaries of state remained constant thereafter until after the first world war. In the post-war decade, three new secretaries of state were instituted – one for the Royal Air Force was split out of the War Office; one for relations with Britain's self-governing Dominions was carved out of the Colonial Office, and the minister responsible for Scottish affairs was raised to the level of a secretary of state.\n\nThis situation remained constant until after the Second World War. At the independence of India in 1947, the India Office and the Dominions Office were merged under a single Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations. A year before, the Secretaries for War and Air had lost their status as cabinet-level ministers, due to a reorganisation of British military command, being subordinated to a new Minister of Defence, and were finally abolished in 1964 and replaced with a new Secretary of State for Defence. A few years later, with the increasing contraction of the British Empire, the Colonial and Commonwealth Relations offices were merged, and in 1968 their responsibilities were subsumed within those of the Foreign Secretary.\n\nBy this time, however, the entire concept of a secretary of state had been largely transformed, as Prime Minister Harold Wilson began in 1964 the process of transforming nearly all of the various ministers and board presidents which made up the British cabinet into secretaries of state. By the end of the twentieth century, virtually all departmental cabinet ministers were secretaries of state, with the notable exception of the Chancellor of the Exchequer who was the Second Lord of the Treasury. In contrast to the general stability of the secretaryships before the 1960s, the exact number and duties of the various secretaries of state has been very fluid with each prime minister; with only the Foreign and Home Secretaries, the two original secretaries of state, maintaining a consistent portfolio.\n\n\nThe honorific title First Secretary of State is awarded occasionally, to signify the senior Cabinet minister after the Prime Minister. It has been in existence since 1962 and is currently held by Dominic Raab since 24 July 2019.\n\n"}

The only difference is that the value of the energy is negative for the antiparticle.\n\nThe formal way to state this property is that the antiparticle scattering amplitudes are the analytic continuation of particle scattering amplitudes to negative energies. The interpretation of this statement is that the antiparticle is in every way a particle going backwards in time.\n\nMurray Gell-Mann and Marvin Leonard Goldberger introduced crossing symmetry in 1954. Crossing had already been implicit in the work of Richard Feynman, but came to its own in the 1950s and 1960s as part of the analytic S-matrix program.\n\nConsider an amplitude formula_10. We concentrate our attention on one of the incoming particles with momentum p. The quantum field formula_11, corresponding to the particle is allowed to be either bosonic or fermionic. Crossing symmetry states that we can relate the amplitude of this process to the amplitude of a similar process with an outgoing antiparticle formula_12 replacing the incoming particle formula_11: formula_14.\n\nIn the bosonic case, the idea behind crossing symmetry can be understood intuitively using Feynman diagrams. Consider any process involving an incoming particle with momentum p. For the particle to give a measurable contribution to the amplitude, it has to interact with a number of different particles with momenta formula_15 via a vertex. Conservation of momentum implies formula_16. In case of an outgoing particle, conservation of momentum reads as formula_17. Thus, replacing an incoming boson with an outgoing antiboson with opposite momentum yields the same S-matrix element.\nIn fermionic case, one can apply the same argument but now the relative phase convention for the external spinors must be taken into account.\n\nFor example, the annihilation of an electron with a positron into two photons is related to an elastic scattering of an electron with a photon (Compton scattering) by crossing symmetry. This relation allows to calculate the scattering amplitude of one process from the amplitude for the other process if negative values of energy of some particles are substituted.\n\n\n"}

Wolfgang Pauli and Felix Villars published the method in 1949, based on earlier work by Richard Feynman, Ernst Stueckelberg and Dominique Rivier.\n\nIn this treatment, a divergence arising from a loop integral (such as vacuum polarization or electron self-energy) is modulated by a spectrum of auxiliary particles added to the Lagrangian or propagator. When the masses of the fictitious particles are taken as an infinite limit (i.e., once the regulator is removed) one expects to recover the original theory.\n\nThis regulator is gauge invariant due to the auxiliary particles being minimally coupled to the photon field through the gauge covariant derivative. It is not gauge covariant, though, so Pauli–Villars regularization cannot be used in QCD calculations. P–V serves as an alternative to the more favorable dimensional regularization in specific circumstances, such as in chiral phenomena, where a change of dimension alters the properties of the Dirac gamma matrices.\n\nGerard 't Hooft and Martinus J. G. Veltman invented, in addition to dimensional regularization, the method of unitary regulators, which is a Lagrangian-based Pauli–Villars method with a discrete spectrum of auxiliary masses, using the path-integral formalism.\n\nPauli–Villars regularization consists of introducing a fictitious mass term. For example, we would replace a photon propagator formula_1, by formula_2, where formula_3 can be thought of as the mass of a fictitious heavy photon, whose contribution is subtracted from that of an ordinary photon.\n\n\n"}

In Euclidean space, the integral often converges for −Re(\"d\") sufficiently large, and can be analytically continued from this region to a meromorphic function defined for all complex \"d\".

Software or electronic inverse filters are often used to compensate for the effect of unwanted environmental filtering of signals.\n\nIn all proposed models for the production of human speech, an important variable is the waveform of the airflow, or volume velocity, at the glottis. The glottal volume velocity waveform provides the link between movements of the vocal folds and the acoustical results of such movements, in that the glottis acts approximately as a source of volume velocity. That is, the impedance of the glottis is usually much higher than that of the vocal tract, and so glottal airflow is controlled mostly (but not entirely) by glottal area and subglottal pressure, and not by vocal-tract acoustics. This view of voiced speech production is often referred to as the source-filter model.\n\nA technique for obtaining an estimate of the glottal volume velocity waveform during voiced speech is the “inverse-filtering” of either the radiated acoustic waveform, as measured by a microphone having a good low frequency response, or the volume velocity at the mouth, as measured by a pneumotachograph at the mouth having a linear response, little speech distortion, and a response time of under approximately 1/2 ms. A pneumotachograph having these properties was first described by Rothenberg and termed by him a circumferentially vented mask or CV mask.\n\nAs practiced, inverse-filtering is usually limited to non-nasalized or slightly nasalized vowels, and the recorded waveform is passed through an “inverse-filter” having a transfer characteristic that is the inverse of the transfer characteristic of the supraglottal vocal tract configuration at that moment. The transfer characteristic of the supraglottal vocal tract is defined with the input to the vocal tract considered to be the volume velocity at the glottis. For non-nasalized vowels, assuming a high-impedance volume velocity source at the glottis, the transfer function of the vocal tract below about 3000 Hz contains a number of pairs of complex-conjugate poles, more commonly referred to as resonances or formants. Thus, an inverse-filter would have a pair of complex-conjugate zeroes, more commonly referred to as an anti-resonance, for every vocal tract formant in the frequency range of interest.\n\nIf the input is from a microphone, and not a CV mask or its equivalent, the inverse filter also must have a pole at zero frequency (an integration operation) to account for the radiation characteristic that connects volume velocity with acoustic pressure. Inverse filtering the output of a CV mask retains the level of zero flow, while inverse filtering a microphone signal does not.\n\nInverse filtering depends on the source-filter model and a vocal tract filter that is linear system, however, the source and filter need not be independent.\n"}

Living for the most part in penury, he wrote poetry extensively and soon became the leading Serbian poet in the last decades of the nineteenth century. As many Serbian artists of that era, he died young, of tuberculosis, in 1894.\n\nHis poetry exemplifies a classic example of modern Serbian language and features the standard Decadent motifs of the epoch: cruel nature (e.g. cold wind blowing across empty fields), and the times of Elagabalus.\n\nIlić was born in Belgrade on 14 April 1860, the youngest son of poet and politician Jovan Ilić. On both sides of the family was of the highest provincial middle class, but was not noble; his father was fairly wealthy after retiring from the Privy Council in 1882, and living quietly as the patriarch of a literary dynasty which he helped create. Jovan Ilić, together with politicians-historians Jevrem Grujić and Milovan Janković, played a critical role in the St. Andrew Day National Assembly in 1858 when the call for a parliamentary check on Alexander Karađorđević's monastic power for the first time gained popular support. Vojislav was educated at various grade schools and high schools and at the end of his school days he enrolled in the Faculty of Philosophy at Belgrade's Grande école (Velika Škola), but did not graduate. The hub of literary activity was his home, where he befriended Jovan Jovanović Zmaj and Đura Jakšić and even married one of Jakšić's daughters. In certain aspects Vojislav does belong somewhat to all the four main periods of European literary style that he passed through in a period of less than 15 years, a unique phenomenon, but his great merit as a poet is that he emancipated himself from the affectations and puerilities of his masters. Literary critic Jovan Skerlić said one of the most striking aspects of Vojislav's activity is the attention he drew to the form and technique of poetic creation.\n\nIn 1885 he joined the Serbian Army as a volunteer and accompanied his detachment to Bulgaria but did not encounter the enemy. The short-lived Serbo-Bulgarian War gave Ilić another direction than the military. From 1887 until 1892 he was an editor at the Government Printing Press. In 1892 he taught at a Serbian grammar school in Turnu Severin, in Romania. That same year he was appointed press secretary at the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and afterwards vice-consul in Priština, then under Turkish rule.\n\nHis first publication was a book simply entitled \"Pesme\" (Poems) which appeared in Belgrade in 1887 and this was followed at other intervals by other volumes of more verse. As a poet he soon made a reputation as one of the ablest and most versatile writers of his day. His influence was infectious, young aspiring poets would gather around him and in that period the term \"Vojislavism\" became a coined word in Serbian literature. In the 1890s a true \"Vojislavism\" reigned among young Serbian poets; no wonder he was proclaimed \"the greatest Serbian poet\" by Skerlić and other critics. Of the best known Serbian poets who looked up to him during that period were Milorad Mitrović, Mileta Jakšić, Aleksa Šantić, Danica Marković, and for a short while even Jovan Dučić, who soon went on to abandon \"Vojislavism\" for a new literary wave that Dučić and Milan Rakić would ultimately espouse, influenced by the French poets. This independence Dučić and Rakić owed in part perhaps to their studies and frequent travels abroad, both were in the diplomatic service. It was Dučić who said, \"Even if Vojislav did not succeed in becoming our greatest poet, he is certainly our most beautiful poet.\"\n\nCritics say he was an ardent follower of Alexander Pushkin: \"As far as Vojislav Ilić is concerned Pushkin's influence is beyond question: everything in Ilić's verses, their rhythm and power of expression remind one of Pushkin.\" Jovan Skerlić reproached him for that, but Ilić himself never made a secret of it and openly avowed in one of his poems that he was a pupil of Vasily Zhukovsky and Pushkin.\n\nIlić was also an ardent follower of Vuk Karadžić's reforms.\n\nIlić died of tuberculosis on 21 January 1894 at the age of 33. He has been credited for having influenced many poets that came after him, thereby paving the way for higher achievements in Serbian poetry in the first two decades of the twentieth century. His work stood the test of time as various editions of his \"Collected Works\" have been published after his death, one in 1907 and 1909, in two volumes.\n\nOf Ilić, Jovan Skerlić wrote: \"What Lukijan Mušicki meant to Serbian literature in the 1830s, Sima Milutinović Sarajlija in the 1840s, Đura Jakšić and Jovan Jovanović Zmaj in the 1860s, so too, did Vojislav J. Ilić make his imprint in the 1890s. He brought Romanticism to its conclusion and ushered in a new direction – Vojislavism.\"\n\nHe is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs.\n\n"}

It features the 2002 champion Tony Stewart on the cover with a scowling look to represent the new Grudges and Alliances feature. It was the only game as of 2002 to feature the previous Winston Cup Champion on the cover. The game had the most extensive soundtrack of the series up from four songs from the previous game. The game also has a career mode, season mode, Lightning Challenge mode, SpeedZone, as well as a tutorial mode featuring Richard Petty. The game is an EA Sports Bio game, and is compatible with other EA Sports Bio games like \"Madden NFL 2004\" and \"NCAA Football 2004\". A Nintendo GameCube port was planned but was cancelled for unknown reasons.\n\n\nThe main feature of the game is the \"Grudges and Alliances\" feature, which is based on the player's driving style and attitude. If the player drives dirty and bumps into other drivers, even if it was an unintentional bump, that driver becomes a \"Rival\", and will bump into the player if they happen to encounter each other later in the race. However, if the player drafts the opponent (a new feature for the game), that rival's level in grudge severity drops. If the player drafts a neutral driver long enough, that driver will become an \"Ally\", and at times will let the player pass. Conversely, if the player bumps into an ally, their alliance will slowly drop. The maximum amount of severity for both grudges and alliances is -100 and +100, respectively. The player can see his/her four highest grudges and alliances at the end of the race. In Season and Career modes, the grudges and alliances the player makes carry over to future races.\n\nThe game received positive reviews from critics, with IGN giving the PS2 version an 8.8/10, praising the sounds, \"QuickSave\", and the microphone support. The main issue that IGN cited was that the driving model is somewhat unrealistic. IGN gave the PC version an 8.5, with the issue being the spotter's incompetence. The Xbox review was also an 8.5, and praised the framerate. GameSpot called the game the Tony Hawk or Madden of NASCAR, and gave the game an 8.8, with Metacritic giving it an 88. The more critical review came from GameZone, giving the game an 8.4.\n\nThe game received many top awards, the most notable was received at the 2003 Video Game Awards, where \"NASCAR Thunder 2004\" won the award for 2003's best racing game. It is currently the only NASCAR game to win an award at the VGAs.\n"}
{"id": "1934392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1934392", "title": "Apache Wicket", "text": "Apache Wicket\n\nApache Wicket, commonly referred to as Wicket, is a component-based web application framework for the Java programming language conceptually similar to JavaServer Faces and Tapestry. It was originally written by Jonathan Locke in April 2004. Version 1.0 was released in June 2005. It graduated into an Apache top-level project in June 2007.\n\nTraditional model-view-controller (MVC) frameworks work in terms of whole requests and whole pages. In each request cycle, the incoming request is mapped to a method on a \"controller\" object, which then generates the outgoing response in its entirety, usually by pulling data out of a \"model\" to populate a \"view\" written in specialized template markup. This keeps the application's flow-of-control simple and clear, but can make code reuse in the controller difficult.\n\nIn contrast, Wicket is closely patterned after stateful GUI frameworks such as Swing. Wicket applications are trees of \"components\", which use listener delegates to react to HTTP requests against links and forms in the same way that Swing components react to mouse and keystroke events. Wicket is categorized as a component-based framework.\n\nWicket uses plain XHTML for templating (which enforces a clear separation of presentation and business logic and allows templates to be edited with conventional WYSIWYG design tools). Each component is bound to a named element in the XHTML and becomes responsible for rendering that element in the final output. The \"page\" is simply the top-level containing component and is paired with exactly one XHTML template. Using a special tag, a group of individual components may be abstracted into a single component called a \"panel\", which can then be reused whole in that page, other pages, or even other panels.\n\nEach component is backed by its own model, which represents the state of the component. The framework does not have knowledge of how components interact with their models, which are treated as opaque objects automatically serialized and persisted between requests. More complex models, however, may be made \"detachable\" and provide hooks to arrange their own storage and restoration at the beginning and end of each request cycle. Wicket does not mandate any particular object-persistence or ORM layer, so applications often use some combination of Hibernate objects, EJBs or POJOs as models.\n\nIn Wicket, all server side state is automatically managed. You should never directly use an HttpSession object or similar wrapper to store state. Instead, state is associated with components. Each server-side page component holds a nested hierarchy of stateful components, where each component's model is, in the end, a POJO (Plain Old Java Object)\n\nWicket aims for simplicity. There are no configuration files to learn in Wicket. Wicket is a simple class library with a consistent approach to component structure.\n\nA Hello World Wicket application, with four files:\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" \n\n<body>\n</body>\n</html>\n\npackage org.wikipedia.wicket;\n\nimport org.apache.wicket.markup.html.WebPage;\nimport org.apache.wicket.markup.html.basic.Label;\n\npublic class HelloWorld extends WebPage {\n\npackage org.wikipedia.wicket;\n\nimport org.apache.wicket.protocol.http.WebApplication;\n\npublic class HelloWorldApplication extends WebApplication {\n\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<web-app xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" \n</web-app>\nBasic components like form, links, repeaters, and so on are built-in.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1934406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1934406", "title": "Crash Nitro Kart", "text": "Crash Nitro Kart\n\nCrash Nitro Kart is a racing video game developed by Vicarious Visions and published by Universal Interactive. The Game Boy Advance, GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox versions were released in North America on November 11, 2003 and in Europe on November 28, 2003; The N-Gage version of the game was released in Europe on June 30, 2004 and in North America on July 28, 2004. The Mobile version was released on September 20, 2004. The PlayStation 2 version was re-released in the three-disc \"Crash Bandicoot Action Pack\" compilation (alongside \"Crash Twinsanity\" and \"Crash Tag Team Racing\") in the United States on June 12, 2007 and in Europe on July 20, 2007. It was the last Crash Bandicoot game released under the Universal Interactive label, which parent company Vivendi would scrap after the release of this game, in favour of their new company, Vivendi Universal Games.\n\nThe game is the ninth installment in the \"Crash Bandicoot\" series. It is an indirect sequel to \"Crash Team Racing\" and the first game in the series to have full motion video. The game's story centers on the abduction of Crash Bandicoot, along with other characters in the series, by the ruthless dictator Emperor Velo XXVII. Threatening to destroy the Earth if they refuse, he forces them to race in his gigantic coliseum for the entertainment of his subjects. \"Crash Nitro Kart\" received mixed reviews, with reviews varying from version to version. The home console version was met with generally fair reviews. Reviewers dismissed the game as a generic kart racer, but commented positively on its \"power slide\" system. The Game Boy Advance version earned slightly better reviews than the console version, while reviews for the N-Gage version were middling, with much of the criticism going to the game's \"tunnel vision\".\n\nContent from the game was remastered as a part of \"Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled\" on June 21, 2019.\n\n\"Crash Nitro Kart\" is a racing game in which the player controls characters from the \"Crash Bandicoot\" universe, most of whom race in karts. While racing, the player can accelerate, steer, reverse, brake, hop or use weapons and power-ups with the game controller's analog stick and buttons. Four distinct types of crates are scattered throughout the tracks and arenas of \"Crash Nitro Kart\". \"Item Crates\" are marked with a question mark (?) and usually come in sets of four. The player can obtain a weapon or power-up by driving through an Item Crate and breaking it apart. The player can only carry one weapon or power-up at a time. \"Multiplier Crates\" are marked with an \"X\" and are usually found in hard-to-reach spots on the tracks. These special crates contain three of a certain weapon or power-up. \"Wumpa Crates\" are unmarked and carry \"Wumpa Fruit\" that strengthens the player's weapons and power-ups if ten of them are obtained. \"Activation Crates\" are marked with an exclamation point (!) and don't give the player anything when they are driven through; instead, they activate either a trap that can slow down the other racers or a boost pad.\n\nBoosting is an important part of \"Crash Nitro Kart\"'s gameplay. When the player boosts, their kart will momentarily go slightly faster than its normal top speed. Boosts are achieved by driving over boost pads scattered across the tracks, pumping the gas at the starting line, and holding the gas button at the right time when being reset on the track. Another technique used for boosting is the \"power slide\". To execute a power slide, the player holds down one of the hop buttons while steering. While sliding, a curved \"boost gauge\" appears next to the player's kart. When the gauge goes from green to red, the player presses the opposite shoulder button to obtain a boost. The higher the boost gauge goes, the more powerful the boost will be. You can do up to 3 boosts. \n\n\"Crash Nitro Kart\" features 6 racing modes: Adventure, Race Time Trial, Lap Time Trial, Quick Race, Team Race and Cup Tournament. Some modes are free-for-all, while others can be played as a team. The \"Adventure Mode\" is a single-player game in which the player must race through all of the tracks and arenas in the game and collect as many Trophies, Relics, Boss Keys, CNK Tokens and Gems as possible. The objective of the Adventure Mode is to win all the races of the five different worlds and win the freedom of the playable characters from the tyrannical Emperor Velo XXVII. The hub world of the game is Velo's Coliseum, from which the player can access any of the five other worlds through special gates. Most of these gates are initially locked; the player must complete the races of one world to gain access to the next world. When inside a world, the player may access a race by driving the selected character onto a \"Warp Pad\". By winning a race, the player will receive a Trophy. When the player receives all three Trophies in a world, the player will be able to race against that world's champion, who acts as a boss character. If the player manages to defeat the world's champion, the champion will relinquish a World Key. This allows the player to engage in the special modes of that world and enables access to the next world.\n\nThe special modes of each race consist of the \"Relic Race\", the \"CNK Challenge\", the \"Crystal Arena\" and the \"Gem Cups\". In the Relic Race, the player must race through a track alone and complete three laps in the fastest time possible. To aid the player, \"Time Crates\" are spread throughout the track. When the player drives the character through a Time Crate, the clock freezes for whatever number of seconds are indicated on the Crate. If all of the Time Crates on a track are destroyed, the player's final time will be reduced by ten seconds. The player wins a Relic by beating the time indicated on the screen. The CNK Challenge is played like a normal race, except that the player must also collect the letters C, N and K scattered throughout the track. If the player manages to collect all three letters and come in first place, a \"CNK Token\" is awarded. These tokens come in four different colors. If the player collects four tokens of the same color, the player will be able to access the Gem Cup of the corresponding color. Gem Cups are racing tournaments held against computer-controlled opponents, and are accessible through a special gate at Velo's Coliseum. If one of these cups is won, a Gem is awarded. When the player collects all the Trophies, World Keys and Relics, the player will be able to race against Emperor Velo on his personal racing track. If the player manages to defeat Velo in this race, the game is won.\n\nThe \"Race Time Trial\" is a single-player mode where the player attempts to set the best time on any of the tracks in the game. There are no other racers to hinder the player, but no item-bearing crates are present to aid the player. When the three-lap race is finished, the player can save a \"ghost\", a replay of that race. The next time that track is accessed in this mode, the player can load the ghost, allowing the player or others to compete with the ghost in a race. If the player finishes each of the tracks in a set time, the player will be able to compete against the ghosts of the game's boss characters. The \"Lap Time Trial\" plays like the Race Time Trial except that the player races to get the best time for a single lap around the track. When one lap is finished, the player's \"ghost\" (a replay of the lap that was just completed) will appear. Whenever a better time on the lap is accomplished, the old ghost will be replaced by the faster one. In the \"Quick Race\", the player selects a character, a track and races. The player can adjust the computer's skill level and the number of laps.\n\nIn the \"Team Race\", the player joins forces with a computer-controlled partner to win a race. When the player and the partner are in close proximity of each other, the \"Team Meter\" will rise. When the Team Meter is full, the player may activate the \"Team Frenzy\", in which the player and partner have temporary access to unlimited weapons and power-ups. In the \"Cup Tournament\", the player competes against other racers on three different tracks. At the end of a track, the racer in first place gets nine points, the second place racer is awarded six points, third place gets three points and fourth place gets one point; the rest get no points. When all three tracks are completed, the racer with the most points wins. This is the only racing mode that can be played by more than one human player.\n\nIn the battle modes, instead of racing on tracks, the player speeds around battle arenas while collecting weapons and attacking opponents. There are five battle modes in \"Crash Nitro Kart\". Each mode can be played by two to four players. In the \"Limit Battle\", the objective is to attack opponents with weapons and traps while avoiding attacks unleashed by the opponents. Offensive and defensive weapons can be collected by smashing special crates. A point and time limit can be set by the player before the game begins. Whoever earns enough points or has enough points when time runs out wins. This mode can be played free-for-all or with teams. In \"Last Kart Driving\", the contestants compete until they run out of lives. A contestant loses a life every time they are hit by a weapon or hazard or fall into a pit. A contestant who runs out of lives will be eliminated. As the title suggests, the last kart driving wins. This mode can be played free-for-all or with teams.\n\nIn \"Crystal Grab\", the contestants must fight to collect all the Crystals in the arena. When a contestant is attacked, they will drop any Crystals they've gathered, allowing opponents to steal them. This mode can be played free-for-all or with teams. In \"Capture the Flag\", two teams attempt to capture each other's flag and bring it back to their respective flags. Players must race to their opponents' side of the map and drive over their flag to grab it. They must then drive over their own flag's base to score a point from the flag they've captured. A flag that has been stolen can be dropped if the thief is hit with any weapon. Stolen flags that have been dropped can be returned to their respective bases. Due to the weight of the flags, any kart with a flag will be slowed down. The game ends when time runs out or when one of the teams has gotten enough points. This mode can only be played in teams. \"Steal the Bacon\" is a variation of \"Capture the Flag\" in which two teams fight over one flag that is situated in the middle of the arena. The teams must attempt to take the flag and bring it to their respective base.\n\n\"Crash Nitro Kart\" features around twenty-seven characters, sixteen of which are playable. The sixteen characters are split into four teams of four with each team driving karts of a matching color.\n\n\"Team Bandicoot\", which pilots blue karts, is led by Crash Bandicoot, the titular protagonist of the series. His kart is an all-round performer with exceptional acceleration. Coco Bandicoot, Crash's younger genius sister, programmed her kart's wheels to balance their speed better, improving her kart's turning ability. Crunch Bandicoot, Crash's friend, originally created by Doctor Neo Cortex to destroy Crash, pilots a kart with amazing momentum and speed but slow acceleration. Fake Crash, an imperfect duplicate of Crash, becomes accessible as a playable character if the player performs 50 consecutive speed boosts on any track in Adventure Mode as a member of Team Cortex.\n\n\"Team Cortex\", which pilots red karts, is led by Doctor Neo Cortex, Crash's archenemy and main antagonist of the series. Like Crash, Cortex pilots a kart that excels in acceleration. Doctor N. Gin, Doctor Cortex's right-hand man, is a mechanical genius who pilots a kart that specializes in turning ability. Tiny Tiger, Doctor Cortex's most faithful henchman, is a hulking giant who pilots a kart with a high top speed like Crunch. Doctor Nefarious Tropy, the self-proclaimed master of time, becomes accessible as a playable character if the player beats all the time records in Race Time Trial Mode.\n\n\"Team Oxide\", which pilots yellow karts, is led by \"Crash Team Racing\"s main antagonist Nitrous Oxide. His henchmen, Zam and Zem, become accessible as playable characters if the player wins the Purple and Green Gem in Adventure Mode respectively. \"Real Velo\", the form Emperor Velo is seen at the end of Adventure Mode, is a part of the Yellow Team and becomes accessible as a playable character if the player wins the Adventure Mode twice: once as a member of Team Bandicoot and once as a member of Team Cortex.\n\n\"Team Trance\", which pilots green karts, is led by N. Trance, the egg-like master of hypnotism. Dingodile and Polar, whom N. Trance has hypnotised, becomes accessible as playable characters if the player wins the Red and Blue Gem in Adventure Mode respectively. Pura, whom Trance has also hypnotised, becomes accessible as a playable character if the player performs 50 consecutive speed boosts on any track in Adventure Mode as a member of Team Bandicoot. Pura was replaced in the GBA version by fellow Universal/Sierra character Spyro the Dragon.\n\nThe main antagonist of the story, Emperor Velo XXVII, is the confident, dominating, bullying and contemptuous ruler of his own galaxy; he threatens to destroy Earth if Crash and Cortex's teams refuse to compete in his Galaxy Circuit. Velo is the final boss character of the game and races alongside two advisors who lay down offensive measures to slow the player down. Preceding Velo are four boss characters who possess \"World Keys\" that are needed to race against Velo. In order, the bosses consist of the following: Krunk, a hulking creature who feels that Earth is a copy of his home planet, Terra, and races to prove which planet is superior; Nash, a genetically engineered shark-like creature who was created to always move; Norm, a goblin-like mime who races alongside a larger and more obnoxious version of himself; and Geary, a robot as much obsessed with perfection as he is with cleaning.\n\nCrash, Coco and Crunch Bandicoot are relaxing while their nemesis, Doctor Neo Cortex, ponders his next course of action in regards to defeating the Bandicoots and achieving world domination. Suddenly, both groups are abducted by a mysterious white light that takes them to a large coliseum somewhere in another galaxy. This galaxy is ruled by Emperor Velo XXVII, who plans on having the teams race for the entertainment of his subjects. He promises the Earthlings that winning the races will win their freedom, but threatens them with the destruction of Earth if they refuse to race. \n\nAfter both teams accept the challenge, Velo explains that the racers will compete on four worlds of his choosing, and promises a race against the galactic champion if the champions of those worlds are defeated. When Krunk, Nash, Norm, and Geary, the champions of Terra, Barin, Fenomena, and Teknee respectively, are defeated, the Earth racers go up against the galactic champion: Emperor Velo himself. The racers defeat Velo, but he refuses to send them back to Earth unless they win all of the time relics and defeat him again. Velo loses again to the Earth racers and literally explodes in a bout of fury, revealing himself to be a robot suit controlled by a small gremlin-like version of himself. \n\nIf Team Bandicoot win the race, Velo, having lost his influence over his subjects, dejectedly relinquishes his empire to the Bandicoots. Crash considers becoming the next emperor of the galaxy, but decides otherwise and gives control back to Velo in exchange for sending the Bandicoots back to Earth. If Team Cortex win the race, Velo struggles with Cortex over the possession of his scepter, only to be stopped by Tiny. Cortex uses the scepter's power in an attempt to return to Earth, but the scepter breaks and sends Cortex, N. Gin and Tiny to Terra instead. When they are confronted by the natives (all of which resemble Krunk), Tiny repairs the scepter and is subsequently revered as a king, much to Cortex's annoyance.\n\nThe game that would become \"Crash Nitro Kart\" was initially conceptualized and developed by Traveller's Tales. The original concept involved vehicles that would sustain damage until they were reduced to a single wheel; the vehicle could be repaired by collecting special items scattered around the tracks. The character Nina Cortex, who would later appear in \"Crash Twinsanity\", was created and designed by Duke Mighten during this stage of development. Development duties of the game were subsequently transferred to Vicarious Visions, where the game was tentatively titled \"Crash Team Racing 2\" during pre-production.\n\nThe characters of the game were designed by series veteran Charles Zembillas, while the environments were designed by Joe Pearson (another veteran of the series), John Nevarez, Alan Simmons and Di Davies. The karts were designed by Perry Zombolis Jr. and Andy Lomerson. Recognizing that full motion video sequences have become the new norm in state-of-the-art video games, Universal Interactive decided that \"Crash Nitro Kart\" would be the first game in the \"Crash Bandicoot\" series to feature such cinematics. The cutscenes of \"Crash Nitro Kart\" were created by Red Eye Studios; pre-production of the cutscenes was handled by Epoch Ink. The screenplay of the cutscenes was written by Dan Tanguay. The studio's eight artists were given four months to create 32 minutes of pre-rendered cinematics. The actual animation phase was to be completed in 15 weeks, breaking down to almost five shots a day or 15 seconds of animation per day for each artist. The in-game versions of the character models were built using 3ds Max and were outfitted with full inverse kinematic setups, morph targets and UV texture maps by Vicarious Visions. These models could not be ported directly into the cinematics due to their lower resolution for optimal real-time interactivity. Instead, the artists of Red Eye Studios worked from concept sketches provided by Vicarious Visions and used Alias Systems' Maya (with which the artists were more familiar) to enhance the detail of the 27 character models in the game, including the Crash Bandicoot character.\n\nGiven the task of forming the personalities of the \"Crash Nitro Kart\" cast through the full-motion videos, the Red Eye Studio artists set certain rules for how each character would carry itself by default. As animator Thomas Happ noted, \"N. Gin, for example, would always default to twitchy, side-to-side glances, while Tiny would often scratch his head in confusion. There were a lot of scenes where the characters are just standing around listening to Emperor Velo talk, and we had to invent ways to personalize their mannerisms and create a uniquely 'thinking character'.\" To achieve the bold and deeply saturated colors and textures for the characters and environments, the artists used Maya as well as Adobe Photoshop and Corel Painter. While the artists adapted many of the sets and props in the cinematics from in-game counterparts, they recreated the majority of these objects from scratch in order to add surrealism to the scenery. The cinematics were completed well in advance of the four-month deadline. The console version of \"Crash Nitro Kart\" was announced by Vivendi Universal prior to the Electronic Entertainment Expo of 2003, while the N-Gage version was announced on February 16, 2004. \"Crash Nitro Kart\" is among the first titles to be developed using the Intrinsic Alchemy middleware technology following Vicarious Visions' purchase of its rights from the defunct Intrinsic Graphics.\n\nThe soundtrack of the game was composed by Ashif Hakik and Todd Masten of Womb Music, while the sound design was created by New Media Audio, a subsidiary of Technicolor Creative Services. Masten was contracted to create the score for the game after leaving Vicarious Visions and returning to California from New York. Based on his research of the \"Crash Bandicoot\" series' \"very recognizable\" sound palette, Masten incorporated numerous percussive tonal instruments into the score of \"Crash Nitro Kart\". Masten extensively used the then-recently released Reason program by Propellerhead Software in the writing of his score for the game, making \"Crash Nitro Kart\" Masten's first entirely digital score. Universal Interactive was so satisfied with the score Masten created that he was asked to remix a custom soundtrack disc as part of a special package deal with Walmart; \"Crash Nitro Kart\" is the second video game composed by Masten to receive a soundtrack release. The game is also among the first to support the 5.1 surround sound format.\n\nThe voice cast of the game consists of Clancy Brown as Doctor Neo Cortex and Uka Uka, Mel Winkler as Aku Aku, Kevin Michael Richardson as Crunch Bandicoot and an advisor of Velo, Debi Derryberry as Coco Bandicoot and Polar, Steven Blum as Emperor Velo XXVII and Crash Bandicoot, Billy West as Nash and Zam, Dwight Schultz as Dingodile and Fake Crash, Marshall R. Teague as Krunk, John DiMaggio as Tiny Tiger, Michael Ensign as Doctor Nefarious Tropy, Quinton Flynn as Doctor N. Gin and Nitrous Oxide, André Sogliuzzo as Norm and Zem, Paul Greenberg as Geary and Pura and Tom Bourdon as N. Trance and an advisor of Velo.\n\nThe Gameboy Advance and Xbox version received \"generally positive\" reviews, while the N-Gage, Gamecube, and PS2 versions received \"mixed or average\" reviews. Manny LaMancha of \"GamePro\" concluded that the gameplay of \"Crash Nitro Kart\" was addictive though not innovative. \"\" said that \"Crash Nitro Kart\" was \"satisfying and challenging at the same time\" and \"a great way to fill that need for speed.\" \"Nintendo Power\" praised the karts as \"fast\" and the power-ups as \"creative\". \"Official PlayStation Magazine\" concluded that \"Vicarious Visions did all it could to emulate the Naughty Dog classic (\"Crash Team Racing\") and just added a PS2 coat of paint.\" \"Play\" magazine said that the game was \"a little generic and heavily recycled, but the powerslide system from \"CTR\" pulls it together.\" Matt Helgeson of \"Game Informer\" dismissed the game as \"probably one of the least exciting racing titles I've played recently.\" Demian Linn of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" noted that the gameplay was \"nearly identical to \"Crash Team Racing's\", even down to the speed-boosting wumpa fruits, so if you loved it before, you'll still love it, and if not... not.\"\n\nThe game's controls were well received. Manny LaMancha of \"GamePro\" concluded that the controls were easy to pick up, but hard to master. \"Official Xbox Magazine\" praised the game's \"solid control\" and \"innovative boost system\". Michael Laffery of GameZone said that the interface was \"simple to use\" and that the game requires no learning curve. Tony Guidi of TeamXbox noted that the \"simplistic\" controls allowed the game to be played by anyone and that due to the different boosting and sliding techniques, \"mastering the control will separate the great racers from the newbs.\" Ryan Davis of GameSpot stated that while the powerslide system \"can give you a serious advantage in the race ... [it] is also very difficult to pull off, requiring flawless timing.\" Steven Rodriquez of Nintendo World Report said that the karts \"control pretty nicely, but can be hard to handle consistently at top speed,\" and added that power sliding was \"easy to do\".\n\nThe graphics of the game were positively received. Manny LaMancha of \"GamePro\" said that the visuals were brightly colored and smoothly animated and noted that the Xbox version's graphics were slightly cleaner than the PlayStation 2 version. Michael Lafferty of GameZone praised the environments as \"lush and richly textured\" and the cutscenes as \"very well done\". Tony Guidi of TeamXbox commended the graphics as \"clean and crisp\" and added that the cutscenes were \"beautifully polished\". Ryan Davis of GameSpot noted that \"\"Crash Nitro Kart\" maintains the brightly colored, cartoony look that has been the hallmark of past \"Crash Bandicoot\" games, though with slightly upgraded graphics. Ed Lewis of IGN said that the graphics for the single-player modes were \"bright and cheery and smooth\", but decreased in quality in the multiplayer modes. Kristan Reed of Eurogamer concluded that \"\"CNK\" stays in exactly the cutesy ballpark you'd expect from the Day-Glo series, neither straying in any way from the generic cartoon worlds of old nor providing any graphical trickery that surprises hardened gamers looking for a splash of eye candy with their cartoon frippery.\" Steven Rodriquez of Nintendo World Report noted that \"if you've played any of the other \"Crash Bandicoot\" games out there, then you have a pretty good idea what this one looks like.\" Russ Fischer of GameSpy said that the game \"some nice graphics, which use a solid framerate and loads of color to capture the old \"Crash\" magic.\"\n\nThe audio received mixed reception. Manny LaMancha of \"GamePro\" said that the in-game voice acting (provided by such stars as Debi Derryberry and Billy West) was \"clear and entertaining\". Tony Guidi of TeamXbox also noted that the character voices were \"done well\" and that the music \"isn't annoying\". However, Michael Lafferty of GameZone stated that the music can become \"a little tiring\" and \"annoying\" after a while. Ryan Davis of GameSpot concluded that the sound was \"respectable\", but added that the \"attitude\" of the character sounds bites seemed \"forced\". Ed Lewis of IGN said that the \"saving grace\" of the \"\"Looney Tunes\"-style repartee and sound effects\" is that \"it was done professionally and while it's pretty silly if you listen to it, it doesn't grate and get under the skin as other games can.\" He added that the music was \"bouncy and peppy and, once again, cartoony\". Steven Rodriguez of Nintendo World Report described the music and sound effects as \"generic\" and \"plain\" respectively, and noted that the best part of the game's audio was \"that sexy talking mask that gives you advice between races, but even he gets rather annoying.\"\n\nThe Game Boy Advance version was reviewed positively. Frank Provo of GameSpot stated that \"the characters aren't nearly as popular as those in Nintendo's Mario Kart game, but the deeper gameplay makes up for that to an extent.\" Craig Harris of IGN criticized the patches of slowdown in the game, but thought that otherwise it \"would be a close contender for best kart racer on the handheld.\" \"Nintendo Power\" concluded that \"although \"Crash Nitro Kart\" doesn't bring anything new to the kart-racing genre, it's a fast and amusing play that Crash Bandicoot fans will enjoy.\"\n\nThe N-Gage version received middling reviews. Levi Buchanan of IGN, in a positive review, praised the game's large selection of characters, tracks and gameplay modes. Ryan Davis of GameSpot commended the game for its fundamentally solid gameplay, smooth and sharp graphics and the amount of \"stuff to do\", but stated that \"the narrow field of vision has a dramatically negative effect on the whole experience, cross-canceling many of the game's positive traits.\" Louis Bedigian of GameZone felt that \"the variety of courses, power-ups, and the decent sense of speed are not enough to make up for a camera, which literally makes you feel sick.\" Justin Leeper of GameSpy criticized the chuggy framerate and tunnel vision of the screen and delivered a final message of \"If the N-Gage library was a classroom, then \"Crash Nitro Kart\" would be the cross-eyed kid who eats paste and thinks the answer to every math problem is 'cat'\". \n\n"}

His formidable grandmother Penelope Paumier is said to have been the main influence in his childhood. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, which he entered when he was only 16, graduating LLD in 1844. He was an outstanding scholar and also enjoyed some reputation as a journalist and minor poet. He became a barrister in 1840, practising mainly in the field of probate and matrimonial law; Queen's Counsel, 1854; Vicar-General of the province of Armagh, 1862; Queen's Advocate in Ireland, 1865; Solicitor General for Ireland, 1868 and Attorney General for Ireland, 1868 and 1874–1875. He became a member of the Privy Council of Ireland in 1868.\n\nBall was a Conservative Member of Parliament for Dublin University 1868–1875 and Vice-Chancellor of the University from 1880. His critics regarded him as an opportunist without any strong political convictions: on a celebrated occasion in the House of Commons, when he asked for the precise date of an event, Richard Dowse, the Government spokesman, replied that it was at roughly the time when Ball joined the Conservative party to advance his political career.\n\nHe opposed the Irish Church Act 1869, (his speech was regarded as one of the finest made in the Commons in living memory), but assisted in framing the future constitution of the disestablished Church of Ireland, of which he was a devout member all his life. He opposed Gladstone's first Irish Land Bill of 1870 and the Irish University Bill of 1873. \n\nOn the return of the Conservative Party to power in 1874, Ball served again as Attorney General for a time. Although his talents undoubtedly entitled him to a seat on the Bench, Disraeli was reluctant to lose a Law Officer of whom he had the highest opinion. When a suitable replacement as Attorney General was found Ball became Lord Chancellor of Ireland, 1875–1880. As a judge his reputation was excellent: his judgments, especially in probate cases, were both learned and well written. When the Conservatives went out of office in 1880, Ball's public career came to an end, and at 65 his health was starting to fail. When the Conservatives returned to power in 1885 Ball was too infirm to accept any office in the new Government. After 1890 he rarely left home.\n\nBall wrote two books, one on the Church of Ireland, the other on the Irish legislative system. Like his judgements, both books were praised both for their learning and strict impartiality: even Gladstone praised the book on the Irish Church highly\n\nBall married Catherine Elrington, daughter of Rev Charles Elrington, in 1852; she died in 1887. They had three sons, Charles, Thomas, and the best-known of their children, F Elrington Ball, who was an author and legal historian, and is still remembered for his definitive work \"The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921\" and for his 6 volume \"History of the Parishes of Dublin.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1934413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1934413", "title": "Upper Street", "text": "Upper Street\n\nUpper Street is the main street of the Islington district of inner north London, and carries the A1 road. It begins at the junction of the A1 and Pentonville Road and City Road, and runs roughly northwards past Angel Underground station, then past the Business Design Centre, then splits at Islington Green (where Essex Road, formerly named Lower Street, branches off), then past the Screen on the Green cinema, the town hall, ending at Highbury & Islington tube station on Highbury corner, where the A1 carries on as Holloway Road. The southernmost , from the junction to Islington Green, also carries the historical name of Islington's High Street.\n\nIt contains many fashionable shops, pubs, restaurants and theatres, including the now closed Granita restaurant where Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were said to have made their deal on the future leadership of the Labour Party.\n\nThe hilltop village of Islington originally consisted of two streets in addition to the High Street: Upper Street and Lower Street, which diverged from the High Street at Islington Green. Both date back to at least the 12th century. Henry VIII hunted duck in the ponds off Upper Street, while Walter Raleigh lived in Upper Street and owned a pub in Lower Street. Lower Street has since been renamed Essex Road.\n\nThe fields around Upper Street, with their close proximity to the growing city of London, were a major farming area. Islington was the home of the Royal Agricultural Hall, and a number of pubs and shops existed along the street to serve farmers and visitors to the hall.\nIn the 18th century Upper Street began to be redeveloped from an agricultural to a residential area. Ten houses were built in 1768 (later named Hornsey Row), and a further group built immediately south of Hornsey Row in 1792. A William Beverley (identified with William Roxby Beverley), the first to solve the problem of a \"magic knight's tour\" (a variant on the knight's tour in which the numbered steps form a magic square) resided in these buildings, now replaced by Islington Town Hall.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, the Upper Street area became notorious for its night-time entertainments. In 1870, Charles Dickens described the area as \"amongst the noisiest and most disagreeable thoroughfares in London.\" and in 1885, it was widely known as \"The Devil's Mile\" on account of its prostitution, crime and the level of drunkenness.\n\nUpper Street is unusual in being one of the few streets in London to have a \"high pavement\". This was constructed in the 1860s to protect pedestrians from being splashed by the large numbers of animals using the road to reach the rear of the new Royal Agricultural Hall (repurposed in 1986 as the present Business Design Centre); as a consequence, the pavement is approximately 1 m above the road surface for some of the length of the street. One of the few other London streets with a high pavement, Liverpool Road, is the next road west of Upper Street and also serviced the Royal Agricultural Hall.\n\nIn recent years Upper Street has become extremely fashionable, and contains numerous pubs and restaurants, including the now closed Granita, where Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were said to have made their deal on the future leadership of the Labour Party once it won power.The pubs along the street are also popular meeting places for supporters going to the nearby Emirates Stadium, home of Arsenal Football Club.\n\nStarting from the south, the first significant venue is a former tram shed, built in 1850 for commuter service to the City. By the 1940s the service had ceased, and the building was converted to an electricity substation, which was then closed by the 1970s. Following some years of lying derelict, it was reopened on 14 November 1979 as The Mall Antiques Arcade, and at its height housed over 35 dealers on its ground and lower ground floors. The building also housed other businesses, such as a restaurant in its upper floors, but the mall closed in 2008. Since 2013, the building has housed several chain shops. It is currently a sofa.com outlet. The closure of the arcade reflects the reduction in the number of antique traders in the nearby Camden Passage, though a weekend antiques market is still held there.\n\nMoving north, there is the Business Design Centre, mentioned above as the Royal Agricultural Hall, and the former Islington Chapel, now Angel Recording Studios. Beyond that is the Church of England parish church. St. Mary's was rebuilt in 1754 and its spire dominates the Islington skyline. The church is a major venue for performances of traditional religious music.\n\nThe Little Angel Theatre is a children's puppet theatre in a former Temperance hall, behind the church. Directly opposite the church is the King's Head Theatre, founded in 1970 as the first pub theatre in the UK. Upper Street also contains the Hope and Anchor, one of the most important venues of the 1970s and 1980s punk and new wave scenes. The Stranglers' album \"Live at the Hope and Anchor\" was recorded here. The building is still in use as a music venue today.\n\nFurther north is Islington Town Hall, where the joint first legal same-sex marriage in England took place on 29 March 2014. Adjacent to the town hall is Islington Museum.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s Upper Street was a focal point of the radical left. It was home to Sisterwrite, Britain's first feminist bookshop, as well as the Trotskyist Pioneer Books, the anarchist Rising Free shop (famous for stealing stock from other shops to sell in theirs) and the socialist Red Books. In the 1980s, Upper Street was home to the Islington Action Group for the Unwaged, a major far left campaigning and activist group, and to the squatter-run Molly's Cafe, a focal point for the anarchist and squatting movement. Upper Street made headlines on 23 July 1995, when the Reclaim the Streets movement took over the street, barricaded it to traffic and held a long party in the street.\n\nUpper Street was one of the settings for local resident Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. The London-based sections of the later books are set in and around Upper Street, the home address of \"Fenchurch\". In addition, the character of Hotblack Desiato is named after a local estate agent.\n\nCitations\n\"'Sources\"\n"}

Dewey had paved the way to win the Republican presidential nomination in the primary elections, where he had beaten former Minnesota Governor Harold E. Stassen and World War II General Douglas MacArthur. In Philadelphia he was nominated on the third ballot over the opposition from die-hard conservative Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft, the future \"minister of peace\" Stassen, Michigan Senator Arthur Vandenberg, and California Governor Earl Warren. In all Republican conventions since 1948, the nominee has been selected on the first ballot. Warren was nominated for vice president. The Republican ticket of Dewey and Warren surprisingly went on to lose the general election to the Democratic ticket of Harry S. Truman and Alben W. Barkley. One of the decisive factors in convening both major party conventions in Philadelphia that year was that Philadelphia was hooked up to the coaxial cable, giving the ability for two of the three then young television networks, NBC and CBS, to telecast for the first time live gavel to gavel coverage along the east coast. Only a few minutes of kinescope film have survived of these historic, live television broadcasts.\n\nThe party platform formally adopted at the convention included the following points:\n\n\nDewey had a long list of potential running mates, including his 1944 running mate Senator John Bricker of Ohio, Representative Charles Halleck of Indiana, former Governor Harold Stassen of Minnesota, and California Governor Earl Warren.

It lies to the northeast of the larger crater Langemak, about a crater diameter to the south-southwest of Bečvář and further east is Love.\n\nThe most distinctive aspect of this crater is the prominent ray system that surrounds the outer rim. This higher-albedo skirt of ejecta extends in a nearly continuous fashion out for several crater diameters, but is more extensive to the north and northeast than elsewhere. Beyond this continuous skirt, occasional rays and wisps of light material extent outwards for many more crater diameters. Due to its prominent rays and generally very fresh appearance, Necho is mapped as part of the Copernican System.\n\nThe mid-east and the middle part of the crater are mostly rough containing several hills.\n\nThe outer rim of Necho is somewhat uneven in form, particularly along the western side where it possesses two inner sides that overlap in almost spiral-like fashion. The rim has a slight outward bulge to the east, and is more uneven along that edge. The inner wall and floor has a high albedo, giving the crater a bright appearance. The inner side is generally wider on the western side, and the interior floor is offset to the eastern half.\n\nThe crater is named after Necho II, the king of the Egyptian 26th Dynasty.\n\nThe crater was informally called \"the Bright One\" by the Apollo 14 crew.

The village of Huntley, four miles from Newent in Gloucestershire, had apparently no connection with the Gordon family or with the town of Huntly in North Britain.\" George Edward Cokayne in \"The Complete Peerage\" says the following with regard to the Duke's choice of Norwich for his Earldom: \"His great-grandmother was the daughter of the 5th Duke of Norfolk and 1st Earl of Norwich, but though that title had become extinct in 1777, the representation thereof did not vest in the issue of that lady.\"\n\nHe was Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland from 1794 to 1806 and from 1807 to 1827. Between 1793 and 1827, he was Chancellor of King's College, Aberdeen. In addition, he was Lord Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire until 1808. He received the Order of the Thistle from King George III on 11 January 1775. The \"Dictionary of National Biography\" described him thus: \"At the time of his marriage the Duke was reputed one of the handsomest men of his day.\"\n\nHe raised the 92nd (Gordon Highlanders) Regiment of Foot in 1794 for the French Revolutionary Wars. He was responsible for establishing the new village of Fochabers as well as those of Tomintoul and Portgordon in Banffshire. He is also credited as the founder of the Gordon Setter breed of dog, having popularised a 200-year-old breed during the 18th century and then formalised its breed standard in 1820.\n\nHe was an enthusiastic supporter and patron of the music of William Marshall (1748–1833), a Scottish fiddler and composer, and famous for his many strathspeys, who acted as steward of the Gordon household.\n\nGordon married firstly on 23 October 1767 at Ayton, Scottish Borders and again at Mr. Fordyce's house in Argyll Street, Edinburgh, Jane, the daughter of Sir William Maxwell, 3rd Baronet of Monreith, by his wife, Magdalen, daughter of William Blair, of Blair, Ayrshire. Jane was described by the diarist Sir Nathaniel Wraxall as a celebrated beauty. From 1787 she was part of the social centre of the Tory party and was described in the Female Jockey Club of 1794 as possessing \"an open ruddy countenance, quick in repartée, and no one excelling her in performing the honours of the table, her society is generally courted\". It went on to say that\n\n\"The Duchess triumphs in a manly mien;\nLoud is her accent, and her phrase obscene.\"\nShe resided for some years in Edinburgh, but eventually refused to renew her residence at George Square, Edinburgh, because it was \"a vile dull place\".\nThe Hon. Henry Erskine is said to have written the following lines to her:\n\n\"That is, quoth he, as if the Sun should say,\nA vile dark morning this – I will not rise to-day.\"\nThe Duke and Duchess's marriage was tempestuous from the start and neither made any particular effort to be faithful to the other. For some years before her death she was bitterly estranged from the Duke. While the Duchess circulated at the centre of society, the Duke lived in retirement at Gordon Castle. Elizabeth Grant mentions \"The great width of the Spey, the bridge at Fochabers, and the peep of the towers of Gordon Castle from amongst the cluster of trees that concealed the rest of the building...the Duke lived very disreputably in this solitude, for he was very little noticed, and, I believe, preferred seclusion.\"\n\nThe Duchess is best remembered for placing the King's shilling between her teeth to help recruitment to the Gordon Highlanders which were founded by her husband. However, she also possessed a capacity for match-making which was unrivalled. Of her five daughters, three were married to Dukes, (Richmond, Manchester and Bedford) and one to a Marquess (Cornwallis).\n\nThe Duchess of Gordon died at Pulteney's Hotel, Piccadilly, Middlesex, on 14 April 1812 and was buried at her beloved Kinrara near Aviemore. After her death Alexander married at the Kirk of Fochabers (probably Bellie) in July 1820, Jane [or Jean] Christie, who was a native of Fochabers and was then aged about 40. Alexander had previously had four children by her. After their marriage she lived in great style, not at the castle, but at a town house in Fochabers. She claimed that by residing at the Castle, which the Duke had rebuilt and enlarged considerably, none of his friends would visit him.\n\nOne of the Duke's illegitimate sons, Colonel Charles Gordon, was given the property of Glasterim near Port Gordon. Curiously, Colonel Gordon had been a great favourite with the late Duchess. Elizabeth Grant described Colonel Gordon as \"much beloved by Lord Huntly, whom he exceedingly resembled, and so might have done better for himself and all belonging to him, had not the Gordon brains been of the lightest with him.\"\n\nJane died on 17 June 1824. The Duke himself died suddenly at Mount Street, Berkeley Square, on 17 June 1827, and was buried in Elgin Cathedral. He was succeeded by his son George Gordon, 5th Duke of Gordon.\n\nThe Duke had a total of seven children by his first wife:\n\nGordon has twice been depicted incorrectly as fighting at the Battle of Waterloo: in the 1970 film \"Waterloo\", where he was played by Rupert Davies, and the \"Dad's Army\" episode \"A Soldier's Farewell\", where he was played by John Laurie.\n\n"}

The convention offers 24-hour programming, including gaming and video.\n\nFanimeCon held an art auction for the charity Habitat for Humanity in 2004. Charities that FanimeCon supported in 2011 included the American Red Cross of Silicon Valley, APA Family Support Services of San Francisco, Cancer Support Community, and Japanese Red Cross Society.\n\nFanimeCon was first held in 1994 at California State University, Hayward, being run by several anime clubs. Foothill College would also host the convention until moving to the Wyndham Hotel in San Jose for 1999. From 2000–2003 the Santa Clara Convention Center hosted FanimeCon. In 2004, FanimeCon moved to the San Jose McEnery Convention Center. That year, the convention brought to the local economy, growing to an estimated in 2013, and in 2014.\n\nProblems with the convention in 2009 included Christian protests and over purchasing of artist alley tables, with the protesters also returning in 2010. In 2011, Saturday saw three hour registration waits, problems with the convention not using a printed schedule, outside religious protesters, and the Marriott fire alarm being pulled on Monday morning. Registration was affected in 2012 by a power outage. FanimeCon's 20th anniversary in 2014 was marked by San Jose having Fanime Day on May 23, 2014. The masquerade in 2015 suffered from technical issues. FanimeCon's masquerade for 2016 was scheduled to run for five hours. FanimeCon 2020 was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n"}
