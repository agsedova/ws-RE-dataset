{"id": "2073056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073056", "title": "Sulmona", "text": "Sulmona\n\nSulmona (; ; ) is a city and \"comune\" of the province of L'Aquila in Abruzzo, Italy. It is located in the Valle Peligna, a plateau once occupied by a lake that disappeared in prehistoric times. In the ancient era, it was one of the most important cities of the Paeligni and is known for being the native town of Ovid of whom there is a bronze statue, located on the town's main road, named after him.\n\nSulmona was one of the principal cities of the Paeligni, an Italic tribe, but no notice of it is found in history before the Roman conquest. A tradition alluded to by Ovid and Silius Italicus, which ascribed its foundation to Solymus, a Phrygian and one of the companions of Aeneas, is evidently a mere etymological fiction. The first mention of Sulmo occurs in the Second Punic War, when its territory was ravaged by Hannibal in 211 BC, who, however, did not attack the city itself. Its name is not noticed during the Social War, in which the Paeligni took so prominent a part; but according to Florus, it suffered severely in the subsequent civil war between Sulla and Gaius Marius, having been destroyed by the former as a punishment for allegiance to his rival. The writings of that rhetorical writer are not, however, to be taken literally, and it is more probable that Sulmo was confiscated and its lands assigned by Sulla to a body of his soldiers. In all events it is certain that Sulmo was a well-peopled and considerable town in 49 BC, when it was occupied by Domitius Calvinus with a garrison of seven cohorts; but the citizens, who were favorably inclined towards Julius Caesar, opened their gates to his lieutenant M. Antonius as soon as he presented himself.\n\nNot much more is known historically of Sulmo, which, however, appears to have continued to be a considerable provincial town. Ovid speaks of it as one of the three municipal towns whose districts composed the territory of the Paeligni: and this is confirmed both by Pliny and the \"Liber Coloniarum\"; yet it does not seem to have ever been large, and Ovid himself designates it as a small provincial town. From the \"Liber Coloniarum\" we learn also that it had received the status of a colony, probably in the time of Augustus; though Pliny does not give it the title of a Colonia. Inscriptions, as well as the geographers and Itineraries, attest its continued existence as a municipal town throughout the Roman Empire.\n\nThe chief claim to fame of Sulmona is derived from its having been the birthplace of Ovid, who repeatedly alludes to it as such, and celebrates its salubrity, and the numerous permanent streams of clear water in which its neighbourhood abounded. But, like the whole district of the Paeligni, it was extremely cold in winter, whence Ovid himself, and Silius Italicus in imitation of him, calls it \"gelidus Sulmo\" Its territory was fertile, cultivation of both in grain and wine are common, and one district, the Pagus Fabianus, is particularly mentioned by Pliny for the care bestowed on the irrigation of the vineyards.\n\nTraditionally, the beginning of the Christian age in Sulmona is set in the 3rd century. The city was part of the diocese of Valva, while a Sulmonese bishop is known from the 5th century. One of the earliest bishops was Saint Pamphilus (San Panfilo), an Italian pagan convert to Christianity in the 7th century from nearby Corfinium. He was elected bishop of Valva in 682 and died in 706. He is the patron saint of Sulmona and is buried in the church dedicated to him, the present Sulmona Cathedral.\n\nSulmona became a free commune under the Normans. Under Emperor Frederick II an aqueduct was built in the town, one of the most important constructions of the era in the Abruzzo; the emperor made it the capital of a large province, as well the seat of a tribunal and of a fair, which it however lost with the arrival of the Angevins. Despite that, it continued to expand and a new line of walls was added in the 14th century.\n\nIn the 16th century a flourishing paper industry was started.\n\nIn 1706 the city was nearly razed by an earthquake. While much of the medieval city was destroyed by the earthquake, some remarkable buildings survive such as the Church of Santa Maria della Tomba, the Palazzo Annunziata, the Aqueduct and the Gothic portal on Corso Ovidio.\n\nMuch of the city was then rebuilt in the prevailing elegant Baroque style of the 18th century.\n\nSulmona experienced an economic boom in the late 19th century, becoming a railway hub given its strategic geographic position between Rome and the Adriatic coast.\n\nThe anarchist and labor organiser Carlo Tresca was born there in 1879 and was active in the Italian Railroad Workers' Federation until emigrating to the US in 1904 to escape a prison term.\n\nSulmona's strategic position also made it a target for air raids during World War II. The railway station, the industrial sections and parts of the old town were damaged, but today they have been mostly restored.\n\nCampo 78 at Sulmona served as a POW camp in both world wars. During World War I, it housed Austrian prisoners captured in the Isonzo and Trentino campaigns; during World War II, it was home to as many as 3,000 British and Commonwealth officers and other ranks captured in North Africa.\n\nThe camp itself was built on a hillside and consisted of a number of brick barracks surrounded by a high wall. During World War II, conditions in Sulmona for both the officers and the men were indifferent. Accommodation was overcrowded. Normal rations of rice soup and bread were occasionally augmented by fresh fruit and cheese in the summer. Some food parcels from the International Committee of the Red Cross were distributed occasionally. For recreation, the prisoners laid out a football field, and they also had equipment for cricket and basketball. There was a theatre, a small lending library, at least one band, and a newspaper produced by a group of prisoners.\n\nIn September 1943, as the Italian government neared collapse, the inmates of Sulmona heard rumours that the evacuation of the camp was imminent. They awoke one morning to discover that their guards had deserted them. On 14 September, German troops arrived to escort the prisoners northwards, to captivity in Germany, but not before hundreds of them had escaped into the hills. One such escapee was the South African author, Uys Krige, who described his experience in a book titled \"The way out.\"\n\nThere were two other smaller camps nearby, \"Fontana d'Amore\", which held British officers, and \"Villa Orsini\", which held very senior Allied officers captured during World War II, including Air Marshal Owen Tudor Boyd, Major-General Sir Adrian Carton de Wiart, Brigadier James Hargest, Lieutenant General Sir Philip Neame, General Sir Richard Nugent O'Connor. All were subsequently transferred to Castello di Vincigliata Campo PG12 near Florence.\n\nSights in Sulmona include:\n\n\nThe remains of the ancient city are of little interest as ruins, but indicate the existence of a considerable town; among them are the vestiges of an amphitheatre, a theatre, and thermae, all of them located outside the gates of the modern city. About 3km from the city, at the foot of Monte Morrone, are some ruins of reticulated masonry, traditionally believed to be Ovid's villa. Today, they are more properly identified as the sanctuary of \"Hercules Curinus\". Nearby is the \"Badia Morronese\", a large (c. 119 × 140 m) religious complex located near Pope Celestine V's hermitage. It was founded by Celestine as a chapel in 1241, and was enlarged and later made into a convent.\nSulmona is the home of the Italian confectionery known as \"confetti\". These are sugar-coated almonds and are traditionally given to friends and relatives on weddings and other special occasions. Confetti can be eaten or simply used as decoration. The local artisans also colour these candies and craft them into flowers and other creations. There are two main factories in town and several shops that sell these items, the most famous of which is Confetti Mario Pelino.\n\n\nThe city has a football team, Pro Sulmona Calcio 1921. The club is currently disbanded, last competing in the 2015–16 season in the Promozione Abruzzo, the seventh division of Italian football.\n\nSulmona is served by the Sulmona railway station, an important station located at the intersection of three railway lines: the Rome–Sulmona–Pescara railway, the Terni–Sulmona railway and the Sulmona-Isernia railway.\n\n\n\nRelating to Sulmona POW camp, Villa Orsini and Fontana d'Amore:\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}

{"id": "2073058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073058", "title": "Hair clipper", "text": "Hair clipper\n\nA hair clipper (often individually known by the apparent plural hair clippers in a similar way to \"scissors\") is a specialised implement used to cut human head hair. They work on the same principle as scissors, but are distinct from scissors themselves and razors. Similar but heavier-duty implements are used to shear sheep, but are called handpieces or machine shears.\n\nHair clippers comprise a pair of sharpened comb-like blades in close contact one above the other and the side which slide sideways relative to each other, a mechanism which may be manual or electrical to make the blades oscillate from side to side, and a handle. The clipper is moved so that hair is positioned between the teeth of the comb, and cut with a scissor action when one blade slides sideways relative to the other. Friction between the blades needs to be as low as possible, which is attained by choice of material and finish, and frequent lubrication.\n\nHair clippers are operated by a pair of handles which are alternately squeezed together and released. Barbers used them to cut hair close and fast. The hair was picked up in locks and the head was rapidly depilated. Such haircuts became popular among boys, mostly in schools, and young men in the military and in prisons.\n\nManual clippers were invented between 1850 and 1890 by Nikola Bizumić, a Serbian barber. While they were widely used in the distant past, the advent and reduction in cost of electric hair clippers has led to them largely replacing manual clippers. Some barbers in Western countries continue to use them for trimming. They are also used in the Russian army: when conscripts enter boot camp, they cut their hair close to the skin, sometimes using manual clippers.\n\nIn Greece, male students had their heads shaved with manual hair clippers from the early 20th century until it was abolished in 1982. The same practice was used in the military, where recruits had their heads shaved as they set foot in boot camp. In the 1950s and 1960s a law was implemented in Greece whereby head shaving with manual clippers was to be used as a punishment for young people caught by police, such as teddyboys and prostitutes. This practice was extended to Greek hippies and leftist youths during the 1967-73 military regime. Obligatory hair clipping was abolished in Greece in 1982.\n\nManual hair clippers are used extensively by barbers in India to give short back and sides haircuts. Orthodox Jews tend to avoid clipping the side of their heads. Among Muslim men, some consider it haram to clip more than a fistful of the beard.\n\nElectric hair clippers work in the same way as manual ones, but are driven by an electric motor which makes the blades oscillate from side to side. They have gradually displaced manual hair clippers in many countries. Three different motor types are used in clipper production: magnetic, rotary and pivot. Rotary style may be driven by direct current or alternating current electricity source. Both magnetic and pivot style clippers use magnetic forces derived from winding copper wire around steel. Alternating current creates a cycle attracting and relaxing to a spring to create the speed and torque to drive the clipper cutter across the combing blade.\n\nLeo J. Wahl invented the first electric hair clipper. He first designed a hand-held massager for his uncle, Dr. Frank Wahl. Frank Wahl opened a manufacturing plant in Sterling, Illinois to produce and sell Leo’s massager. During this time, Leo would sell massagers to various barbers and noticed an opportunity to improve upon the tools barbers were using at the time.\n\nLeo Wahl took over his uncle’s manufacturing business after Frank left to serve in the Spanish American War in 1898. Leo continued to work on his inventions and by 1921, he patented his final design of an invention more than a decade in the making- the first electric hair clipper. Within a year, Wahl Manufacturing had manufactured and sold thousands of clippers all over the United States and in 1921 Leo renamed the company the Wahl Clipper Corporation.\nWhen Leo J. Wahl died on May 20, 1957 he had over 100 patent applications to his name. His descendants still operate the company today. Wahl Clipper is now an international industry leader in the manufacturing of products for the professional beauty and barber salon trade, consumer personal care and animal grooming. Wahl products are available in 165 countries around the world.\n\nBy 1921, Mathew Andis Sr. entered the electric clipper industry. Production of these clippers began in the basement of his home, with help from Anna, his wife. Andis sold his electric clippers door to door and one year later established the Andis O M Manufacturing with John Oster and Henry Meltzer. After the three men parted ways, Mathew established Andis Clipper Company the following year. Today, Andis Company remains a family-held business.\nIn 1928, the John Oster Manufacturing Company joined the electric clipper market. In 1960, the John Oster Manufacturing Co. was acquired by Sunbeam Corporation. Oster continues to manufacture clippers today but is also known for their kitchenware including but not limited to toasters, ovens, blenders, etc.\nWahl Clipper, Andis Company and Oster Company all remain in business today and are highly successful in the clipper industry as are many other companies, such as Kim Laube & Co. Kim Laube & Co specializes in clippers powerful enough for the animal grooming industry, and is committed to keep their manufacturing in U.S.A.\n\nElectric hair clipper blades must be lubricated frequently. Each major hair clipper manufacturer sells its own brand of hair clipper oil. Clippers can also be maintained with aerosol clipper spray which acts as a coolant, disinfectant, lubricant, cleaner, and rust preventative. It is possible to find out what is inside such a product by viewing the product's safety data sheet online. Wahl Hair Clipper Oil, for example, is simply mineral oil packaged in a bottle with a dropper tip.\n\nMost consumer grade hair clippers use a vibrating motor that moves the blade at a high resonant frequency. Sometimes the motor will come out of tune and make a loud noise. There is a screw on the side that is used to retune the motor and bring it back into resonance. Turn the clipper off and rotate the screw counter-clockwise half a turn. Turn the clipper back on and the loud buzzing should have stopped, indicating the motor is back in resonance. No further tuning is needed. The motor will transfer maximum power to the blade at this setting.\n\nBlades are usually made of rust-resistant stainless steel.\nCeramic cutters are available; they are not subject to corrosion, and stay sharper longer because of a higher resistance to wear than metal blades. They remain cool to the touch even with fairly prolonged use, as ceramic is a poor heat conductor. However, ceramic blades are brittle and easily broken, and more expensive to replace than metal blades.\n\n"}

Records in 1963. The album consists of a single continuous composition—partially written as a ballet—divided into four tracks and six movements.\n\nThe album was recorded on January 20, 1963 by an eleven-piece band. Mingus has called the album's orchestral style \"ethnic folk-dance music\". Mingus's perfectionism led to extensive use of studio overdubbing techniques. The album features liner notes written by Mingus and his then-psychotherapist, Edmund Pollock. \"The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady\" is often characterized by jazz and music critics as one of Mingus's two major masterworks (the other being \"Mingus Ah Um\") and has frequently ranked highly on lists of the best albums of all time.\n\nBob Hammer was co-orchestrator and arranger for the album. In the book \"The Penguin Jazz Guide: The History of the Music in the 1000 Best Albums\", Sue Mingus says: \"In some fashion, Charles absorbed Bob Hammer's rehearsal band for a six-weeks gig he had at the Village Vanguard in 1963, which provided a unique opportunity to work out, night after night, one of his greatest compositions, The Black Saint and The Sinner Lady.\"\n\nIn the book \"Mingus Speaks\", arranger Sy Johnson recollects: \"Bob Hammer was very successful at that. He's a piano player, who was around here, in 1962 or something like that, when he did Mingus's masterpiece, as far as I concerned, a brilliant piece of orchestration and brilliant performance of \"The Black Saint and The Sinner Lady\"\".\n\n\"The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady\" is among the most acclaimed jazz records of the 20th century. Richard Cook and Brian Morton, writers of \"The Penguin Guide to Jazz\", awarded the album a \"Crown\" token, the publication's highest accolade, in addition to the highest four-star rating. Steve Huey of AllMusic awards \"The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady\" five stars out of five and describes the album as \"one of the greatest achievements in orchestration by any composer in jazz history.\" \"Q magazine\" describes the album as \"a mixture of haunting bluesiness, dancing vivacity, and moments of Andalusian heat...\" and awards it four of five stars.\n\nThe album was included in Robert Dimery's \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2073069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073069", "title": "In Her Shoes (film)", "text": "In Her Shoes (film)\n\nIn Her Shoes is a 2005 American comedy-drama film based on the novel of the same name by Jennifer Weiner. It is directed by Curtis Hanson with an adapted screenplay by Susannah Grant and stars Cameron Diaz, Toni Collette, and Shirley MacLaine. The film focuses on the relationship between two sisters and their grandmother.\n\nMaggie (Cameron Diaz) and Rose Feller (Toni Collette) are very different sisters, raised by their father Michael (Ken Howard) and stepmother Sydelle (Candice Azzara) after their mother Caroline died in a car accident. Rose is the elder; an ostensibly plain and serious lawyer who is protective of Maggie despite her flaws. Maggie is a free spirit who is unable to hold a steady job (due to her virtual inability to read) and turns to alcohol and men for emotional and financial support. Rose grudgingly allows Maggie to move in with her in her Rittenhouse Square apartment in Philadelphia when their stepmother throws her out of the house. Their already difficult relationship turns worse when Rose catches Maggie in bed with Jim (Richard Burgi), a man Rose has been dating. A heartbroken and furious Rose throws Maggie out.\n\nA few days before, while secretly looking through her father's desk for money, Maggie had discovered a bundle of old greeting cards for her and Rose, containing cash, from their \"estranged\" grandmother Ella (Shirley MacLaine). Homeless and without job prospects, Maggie travels to Florida to find Ella. Ella invites Maggie to stay in her home. Ella admits to her close friend Ethel how Caroline was bipolar, and sent Ella a note several days before her death to look after her girls. However, as time passes, Ella discovers that Maggie has visited to do nothing but sunbathe and take money from her. Maggie asks Ella to finance an acting career, but Ella agrees to match her salary dollar for dollar if she accepts a job with the assisted living section of her grandmother's retirement community. Meanwhile, Rose has decided to quit her job, become a dog-walker, and date Simon Stein (Mark Feuerstein), a coworker whom she had previously ignored. They become engaged. Maggie is befriended by one of her patients, a blind retired professor of English literature (Norman Lloyd), who has asked Maggie to read works of poetry to him. She does so, but with great difficulty. After asking if she is dyslexic, the professor encourages Maggie to continue reading to him while offering guidance and emotional support. Maggie becomes friendly with other residents of the retirement community, and discovers that some of the women need a personal clothing shopper, an activity for which Maggie shows enormous talent. Ella offers to run the financial aspects of the business, and in the process she and Maggie become close and resolve their history.\n\nMeanwhile, Rose's reluctance to talk about Maggie is straining her relationships with Simon and her father. While Michael remains oblivious to his daughters' falling out, Simon tries to get Rose to talk about Maggie. When he sees Rose talking to Jim about Maggie, Simon's patience has grown thin and effectively dumps Rose after she continues staying silent about Maggie. Ella contacts Rose and sends a plane ticket, asking her to come for a visit. Rose is excited to hear from her long-lost grandmother, but her pleasure quickly sours when she arrives and discovers that Maggie already lives there. Rose reveals to Ella and Maggie that after Caroline took young Rose and Maggie on a spontaneous trip to New York without Michael's knowledge, Michael and Caroline had a huge argument, with Michael threatening to put her in a mental institution. Caroline killed herself two days later after sending a note to Ella, pleading with her to take care of her daughters. Maggie does not remember this as Rose shielded her from the events to protect her. Simon arrives in Florida, summoned by Maggie, and he and Rose reconcile. Rose opens up to him about Maggie and her desire to protect her, fearing that Simon will come to hate Maggie. Later, Rose's wedding takes place at the Jamaican Jerk Hut in Philadelphia where she and Simon had their first date. Ella and Michael reconcile, and Maggie reads a poem to Rose as a wedding gift, which moves Rose to tears.\n\n\n\"In Her Shoes\" has received generally positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 75% of the critics gave the film a positive reviews, based on 164 reviews, with an average rating of 6.85/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Honesty and solid performances make \"In Her Shoes\" a solid fit for all audiences\". Metacritic reports an average review score of 60%, based on 36 reviews. Rex Reed in \"The New York Observer\" calls \"In Her Shoes\" \"pure joy\" and \"a movie to cherish\", arguing that Shirley MacLaine has \"found her finest role since the Oscar-winning \"Terms of Endearment\" [...] funny and poignant, she uses abundant humanity and smart psychology to great advantage, lending her knowledge to the other actors generously.\" Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" states that the film \"starts out with the materials of an ordinary movie and becomes a rather special one. The emotional payoff at the end is earned, not because we see it coming as the inevitable outcome of the plot, but because it arrives out of the blue and yet, once we think about it, makes perfect sense. It tells us something fundamental and important about a character, it allows her to share that something with those she loves, and it does it in a way we could not possibly anticipate. Like a good poem, it blindsides us with the turn it takes right at the end.\"\n\nMick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" argues, on the other hand, that the film \"is almost a true statement, almost an honest rendering of a sibling relationship and almost not a sentimental Hallmark card of a movie. But it compromises with itself and ends up in a limbo of meaninglessness, with writer Susannah Grant and director Curtis Hanson strenuously pretending to have told one kind of story, when actually they've told quite another.\" Carino Chocano of the \"Los Angeles Times\" concurs, calling the film \"a curious movie, hovering for upward of two hours between light and dark, truth and fake uplift, menace and mollycoddling.\"\n\nThe film opened at #3 at the U.S. Box office raking in $10,017,575 USD in its first opening weekend.\n\nShirley MacLaine\n\nToni Collette\n\nCameron Diaz\n\n\n"}

His best known work is the Chronicon Helveticum, a history of the early Swiss Confederation.\n\nHaving served his native land in various offices, in 1558 he became the chief magistrate or \"Landarnmann\", and in 1559 was ennobled by the Emperor Ferdinand, to whom he had been sent as ambassador.\n\nOriginally inclined to moderation, he became later in life more and more devoted to the cause of the Counter-Reformation. It is, however, as the historian of the Swiss Confederation that he is best known. He collected material for three major works, which have never wholly lost their value, though his researches have been largely corrected. In 1538 his book on Rhaetia, written in 1528, was published in Latin and in German: \"De prisca ac vera Alpina Rhætia\", or \"Die uralt warhafftig Alpisch Rhætia\".\n\nTschudi's chief works were not published until long after his death. The \"Beschreibung Galliae Comatae\" appeared under Gallati's editorship in 1758, and is mainly devoted to a topographical, historical and antiquarian description of ancient Helvetia and Rhaetia, the latter part being his early work on Rhaetia revised and greatly enlarged. This book was designed practically as an introduction to his magnum opus, the \"Chronicon Helveticum\", part of which (from 1001 to 1470) was published by J. R. Iselin in two stately folios (1734–1736); the rest consists only of rough materials. There exist two rather antiquated biographies of Tschudi by I. Fuchs (2 vols, St Gall, 1805) and C. Vogel (Zürich, 1856).\n\nTschudi worked from both documents and legends to portray the ancient traditions of Swiss defense of liberty, giving roles not only to William Tell but to the heroic moment of the foundation of the Confederacy, when Werner Stauffacher representing Schwyz, Walter Fürst of Uri and Arnold of Melchtal for Unterwalden meet at the Rutli, a meadow above Lake Lucerne, and take an oath to defend Swiss freedom. Tschudi’s influential text dates that event to 8 November 1307.\n\nDown to the latter part of the 19th century Swiss historical writers had largely based their works on his investigations and manuscripts. The historical reputation of Tschudi has suffered after later research. His statements and documents relating to Roman times and the early history of Glarus and his own family had long roused suspicion. Detailed examination has proved that he not merely claimed to have copied Roman inscriptions that had never existed, and amended others in an arbitrary fashion, but that he deliberately forged documents to push back the origin of his family to the 10th century. He thus also entirely misrepresented the early history of Glarus, which is that of a democratic community, and not (as he pretended) that of a preserve of several aristocratic families. Tschudi's historical credit is thus low, and no document printed or historical statement made by him can be accepted without careful verification and examination.\n\nFor a summary of these discoveries see Georg von Wyss in the \"Jahrbuch\" of the Historical Society of Glarus (1895), vol. xxx., in No. i (1894), of the \"Anzeiger f. schweizerische Geschichte\", and in his \"Geschichte d. Historiographie in d. Schweiz\" (1895), pp. 196, 201, 202. The original articles by Vogelin (Roman inscriptions) appeared in vols xi., xiv. and xv. (1886–1890) of the \"Jahrbuch f. schweizer Geschichte\", and that by Schulte (Glarus) in vol. xviii. (1893) of the same periodical. For the defence, see a weak pamphlet, \"Schulte u. Tschudi\" (Coire, 1898), by P. C. von Planta.\n\n"}

The two towns formed a joint urban district from 1927 until 1974, before becoming part of Wyre. The two towns constitute part of the Blackpool Urban Area.\n\nThe civil parish of Thornton became an urban district in 1900, and was then renamed Thornton-Cleveleys in 1927. On April 1, 1974, the urban district became part of the Borough of Wyre. Thornton-Cleveleys corresponds with five wards of the borough.\n\nAccording to the 2001 census Thornton-Cleveleys has a population of 25,547, increasing to 28,703 at the 2011 census. The population of the individual borough council wards was recorded as:\n\nThornton is first mentioned in 1086 in the Domesday Book, where it was referred to as \"Torentum\" (a name preserved by Torentum Court on Lawsons Road). At the time it covered a large area including what are now Cleveleys and Fleetwood, and had a very low population density. It is thought that a settlement had existed at the site since the Iron Age, and a Roman road passes close to the village. The area remained lightly populated until 1799, when the marshland around the village was drained and agricultural production began on a large scale.\n\nA railway station was opened in Thornton in 1865. The opening of salt works at nearby Burn Naze by the United Alkali Company in the early 1890s (later becoming ICI) led to significant expansion of the village, with new houses and community buildings constructed. Thornton became an urban district council in 1900, surviving until 1974 when it became part of the Wyre Borough Council.\n\nThornton for Cleveleys railway station was formerly the principal intermediate stop on the Fleetwood branch of the LMS/British Rail London Midland Region railway, running from Poulton-le-Fylde, but it has been years since the station was used, and with the recent fencing-over of the level crossing in Station Road/Victoria Road East in order to prevent youths from congregating on the tracks, the glory days of Thornton are long since gone. However, a decision by an action group based in Poulton means they will finance a feasibility study into bringing the railway back to Thornton and Fleetwood.\n\nMarsh Mill, a large, well-preserved windmill built in 1794, is a prominent landmark. It was commissioned by Bold Hesketh, uncle of Peter Hesketh (later Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood), who would go on to play a prominent role in the expansion of Fleetwood. Tragedy struck in May 1930, when a Miss Alice Baldwin and a Mrs Mary Jane Bailey visited the windmill with an interest in purchasing it. However, when both women stepped onto the fantail platform, the platform collapsed and the women fell to their deaths.\n\nThornton contains a number of schools, including Baines Endowed Primary School, Thornton Primary School, Stanah Primary School, Royles Brook Primary School and Millfield Science and Performing Arts College. The public library, situated at Four Lane Ends, was closed down in the autumn of 2016 as a result of cost-cutting measures by Lancashire County Council. This decisions was hugely unpopular and despite protests and a petition, the decision to close the library wasn't initially overturned, but the library reopened in February 2018 after the decision was reversed.\n\nThornton-Cleveleys is home to Thornton-Cleveleys R.U.F.C. who play rugby in the RFU Northern Division, North Lancs 1.

For breast cancer it is often used together with docetaxel. It is taken by mouth.\nCommon side effects include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, and rashes. Other severe side effects include blood clotting problems, allergic reactions, heart problems such as cardiomyopathy, and low blood cell counts. It is not recommended in people with kidney problems. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. Capecitabine, inside the body, is converted to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) through which it acts. It belongs to the class of medications known as fluoropyrimidines, which also includes 5-fluorouracil and tegafur.\nCapecitabine was patented in 1992 and approved for medical use in 1998. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about US$122.64–195.66 per cycle of medication. In the United Kingdom it costs the NHS about £210.67 per cycle.

Although in his first full season he helped the team finish sixth in the League, with low attendances the club had fallen into debt and had to sell many of their best players, with stars such as Tim Coleman, Bert Freeman, Jimmy Sharp, Jimmy Ashcroft and William Garbutt all leaving during 1908. Although Morrell led the club to 6th place in 1908-09, at the time an all-time best, after that the club declined, finishing 18th the next.\n\nIn 1910 Arsenal were taken over by Sir Henry Norris but despite speculation he would be sacked, Morrell continued in his post. Arsenal rallied to finish 10th, in mid-table, for both the 1910-11 and 1911-12 seasons. Morrell applied for the job of Leeds City manager in the 1912 close season but dropped out of the running after being dissuaded by the Arsenal board; the job went instead to Herbert Chapman, who would one day manage Arsenal. Unfortunately for Morrell, by staying he oversaw a massive drop of form in 1912-13. Woolwich Arsenal eventually finished bottom of the First Division, giving Morrell the distinction of being the only Arsenal manager to have overseen a relegation.\n\nDespite relegation, Arsenal, who had by now moved to the new Arsenal Stadium, Highbury, retained Morrell and under him they came close to automatic promotion, finishing third in the Second Division in 1913-14 (missing out on second on goal average) and then fifth in 1914-15. This placing was high enough to get them eventually elected back into the expanded First Division in 1919, when competitive football resumed after the conclusion of World War I; however, Wolves and Barnsley had finished higher that season and were not granted promotion. Arsenal's return to the First Division appears to have been mainly thanks to political machinations by their chairman, Henry Norris, rather than their performance.\n\nBy then, Morrell was no longer Arsenal manager; after having been told he was due to be sacked at the end of the 1914-15 season due to the suspension of football due to World War I, he resigned on or around 19 April 1915. He returned to Scotland to manage Third Lanark and his fate after that is unknown.\n\n"}

{"id": "2073120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073120", "title": "DDT (professional wrestling)", "text": "DDT (professional wrestling)\n\nIn professional wrestling a DDT is any move in which the wrestler has the opponent in a front facelock/inverted headlock, and falls down or backwards to drive the opponent's head into the mat. The classic DDT is performed by putting the opponent in a front facelock and falling backwards so that the opponent is forced to dive forward onto their head. Although widely credited as an invention of Jake Roberts, who gave the DDT its famous name, the earliest known practitioner of the move was Mexican wrestler Black Gordman, who frequently performed it during the 1970s.\n\nRumors abound as to what the letters DDT supposedly stood for, including \"Damien's Death Trap\", \"Damien's Death Touch\", \"Damien's Dinner Time\" (all named after Jake's pet python, Damien), \"Drape Drop Takedown\", \"Drop Down Town\" and \"Death Drop Technique\". When asked what DDT meant, Jake once famously replied \"The End.\" The abbreviation itself originally came from the chemical dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, a notorious pesticide, as stated during shoot interviews and Jake's \"Pick Your Poison\" DVD.\n\nThe wrestler lifts the opponent onto his shoulders as in an Argentine backbreaker rack, pushes the opponent's legs while still holding the front facelock, flipping them over to the front of the wrestler. The wrestler falls down to the mat front first, driving the opponent face first down to the mat.\n\nAlso called a single arm DDT, this variation of the armbreaker involves the attacking wrestler grabbing the opponent's left or right arm, holding it across their chest and then falling backwards, dropping the opponent face first as well as damaging the opponent's arm and shoulder.\n\nThe wrestler applies a front facelock to the opponent, then lifts the opponent into an elevated leg-trap bodyscissors position and finally fall backwards driving the opponent head first down to the mat. WWE wrestler Paige uses this variation as a finishing move called the \"Ram-Paige\". A variation, known as a hammerlock cradle DDT, involves the attacking wrestler lifting the opponent into a bearhug, applying a hammerlock, then a front facelock, then finally driving the opponent's head into the mat. British wrestler Joseph Conners uses this variation, known as the \"Righteous Kill\" and Nia Jax has been utilizing a version of the move since her return from injury.\n\nInnovated by Kenta Kobashi. Instead of applying a head or facelock, the wrestler bends his opponent forward and hooks each arm behind the opponent's head, a position known as a butterfly. The wrestler then tucks the opponent's head under one of his arms and falls back to pull the opponent down either flat on his face, which is the more common variant, or onto the top of their head, causing them to roll over like in a regular DDT. It is also known as a double arm DDT or a butterfly DDT. Mick Foley, Stevie Richards, Drew McIntyre, and Jon Moxley have all popularized variations of this DDT: Foley used an unnamed jumping version, Richards uses a lifting version he calls the \"Stevie-T\", McIntyre used a snap version called the \"Future Shock\", and Moxley uses both a regular version called the \"Paradigm Shift\" and a lift-and-snap version called the \"Death Rider\" (having previously called the regular version the \"Dirty Deeds\" when performing under his Dean Ambrose name).\n\nThe wrestler stands in an elevated position (usually the top rope) and faces the standing or bent-over opponent. As they dive, the wrestler wraps their near arm around the opponent's head in a front facelock and swings themselves backwards in midair, landing back-first and simultaneously forcing the opponent's head into the mat.\n\nThis version of a DDT first sees an attacking wrestler place the opponent on an elevated surface, usually the ropes or the turnbuckle, while applying a front facelock. The attacking wrestler next draws the opponent away from the elevated surface leaving the opponent's feet over the elevated surface (i.e. ring ropes), making them the only thing other than the wrestler keeping the opponent off the ground. The attacking wrestler then falls backwards so that the opponent is forced to dive forward onto their head with extra force due to the height of which they were dropped. This DDT variation used as a signature move by Randy Orton. This can also be performed as a double team move. A slight variation, known as a diving DDT or a Halo DDT, exists and sees the wrestler and the opponent both on an elevated surface, albeit with the wrestler facing the ring. With the opponent in the front facelock, the wrestler and the opponent both dive off the elevated surface, resulting in the wrestler falling forward to perform the DDT instead of falling backwards. The move is sometimes referred to as a \"spike DDT\", because the defending wrestler lands in an upside-down, almost completely vertical position (known as the \"spiked\" position, which refers to when a wrestler is actually dropped vertically upside down). This move is usually performed with the defending wrestler's feet on the middle rope, sometimes to an opponent attempting to enter the ring.\n\nThe wrestler applies a front facelock and then falls backwards, much like a normal DDT, but instead of the opponent's head impacting the mat, the wrestler falls to a kneeling or sitting position driving the face of the opponent on to their knee.\n\nAlso known as a front flip DDT. After applying a front facelock, the wrestler pushes off the mat with their legs to flip the opponent and drive them onto the top of their head in a manner similar to the flip piledriver. This move is used by Drago in Lucha Underground.\n\nAlso known as a Samurai Driver, this DDT sees a wrestler place their head between the thighs of an opponent before jumping up while pushing away from the opponent's thighs to flip up and sit on the shoulders of the opponent. The wrestler then spreads their legs, dropping off the opponent's shoulders as they grab hold of the opponent's head in a front facelock to fall down to the mat back first, driving the opponent's head down to the mat. This move sees the attacking wrestler get lifted in a powerbomb position so often this move is used as a counter to a powerbomb.\nThis DDT sees the wrestler stand in front of his opponent facing at him, duck, hook one of his arms over the opponent's shoulder (if it's the opponent's left shoulder that the attacker chooses to seize, he hooks with his right, or opposite if sides are reversed), swing himself under the opponent's armpit then around and over the opponent's back so that he faces the same way as the opponent, lock the opponent's head under his other hand's armpit, spin another 180° to end up having the opponent locked in a front facelock and fall back to drive the opponent skull first to the mat, as in a regular DDT. The maneuver is usually performed after the attacker ducks a punch or a clothesline.\nA variant of the DDT popularized by Raven, the attacking wrestler would kick the opponent in the stomach before applying a front facelock and falls backwards to drive the opponent's head into the mat.\n\nAlso described as a fireman's carry implant DDT, this move sees the attacking wrestler first put an opponent up in the fireman's carry (across the wrestler's shoulders) position, then throw the opponent's legs out in front of him/her to spin them out while the attacking wrestler switches the position of their arm that's holding the opponent's head to a front facelock and falls backwards to drive the top of the opponent's head into the mat.\n\nAfter applying a front facelock, the wrestler hooks the opponent's near leg with his other arm, slightly hoists him up and falls backwards on to his back, driving the opponent's head down to the mat.\n\nVery different from a classic or traditional DDT, as the wrestler never uses his hand in this variation. The wrestler catches the opponent in a standing headscissors, and then falls backwards, slamming the opponent into the mat face-first. \n\nAlso often referred to as the Hurricanrana Driver or Hurricanrana Piledriver.\nThis move was used by Naomi.\nVariation of a classic DDT in which wrestler first applies a hammerlock on the opponent's further arm, then goes for a front facelock, and then falls backwards on to his back, driving the opponent's head down to the mat. Andrade uses this move as a finisher he calls “La Sombra”. Tessa Blanchard also uses a variant of the move.\n\nImplant DDT refers to variations of the DDT where the opponent is driven to the mat face first, as in a faceplant, and not on to their heads. The most common variation is the lifting DDT. A common variation of the double underhook DDT is the implant variation. Another variation sees the wrestler place their opponent in a headlock, but instead of falling backwards they leap backwards onto their back, pulling the opponent with them face first to the mat.\nA slight variation where instead of just falling backwards, the wrestler jumps up while holding the front facelock and then uses the weight and momentum to pull the opponent down on their head. Also, a variation of this move is sometimes seen where, as the wrestler jumps, they use the horizontal position to execute a front dropkick to the knees of the opponent to add additional impact to the move.\n\nAlso known as the Russian legsweep DDT. In these versions of a DDT the wrestler applies a front facelock and then performs a type of legsweep to essentially take out the legs from under the opponent before falling backwards to drive the opponent face first down to the mat.\n\nThis version of a DDT is similar to a spike DDT and is often referred to as a low angle brainbuster, or simply as an implant DDT. The attacking wrestler applies a front facelock to an opponent then lifts the opponent off the ground just before falling backwards to drive the opponent face or head first down to the mat. A slight variation of this sees the wrestler spin the opponent's body away from themselves as they raise the opponent off the ground. Another version, the lifting inverted DDT, sees the wrestler apply an inverted facelock, lift the opponent off the ground and fall back. This move was popularized by Gangrel during his stint in WWE as his finishing move, calling it the \"Impaler DDT\", and was later adopted by Edge, who called it the \"Edgecution\". It is now currently performed by Robert Roode who uses a swinging variation as a finishing move, calling it the \"Glorious DDT\".\n\nWith the opponent placed in a front facelock, the attacking wrestler performs a Moonwalk maneuver across the ring and then proceeds to execute a classic DDT slam.\n\nThe attacking wrestler puts the opponent over the shoulder as in a powerslam set up but instead throws them off and around their body grabbing their head and executing a modified DDT or a modified facebuster.\n\nThe wrestler charges at a bent-forward opponent and applies a front facelock before dropping backwards to drive the opponent down to the mat head first. In another variation the wrestler will also push the opponent up with his free arm, performing a spike DDT version of the move.\n\nThis move sees the wrestler apply the front facelock and then put one of their legs on one of the opponent's arms before falling backward and driving the opponent head first to the mat.\n\nThe opponent is facing the wrestler on the turnbuckle. The wrestler then does a backflip towards the opponent catching the opponent into a DDT on the way down.\n\nThe wrestler places the opponent in a front facelock and hooks only one of the opponent's arms behind their neck, as if going for a suplex, before falling back and driving the opponent's head into the mat. A variation of this move sees the wrestler lift the opponent off the ground after applying the underhook, before falling back to drive the opponent head first down to the mat. This lifting variation was popularized by Prince Devitt, who used it as a finisher under the name of \"Bloody Sunday\" and the \"1916\" as Finn Bálor.\n\nThe wrestler stands on the ring apron and performs a slingshot, and as they pull themselves over the top rope, they grab their opponent in a front facelock and fall backwards, driving their opponent's head into the mat. This version is used as a finisher by Johnny Gargano.\n\nThe wrestler applies a front facelock to their opponent. The wrestler then jumps down onto their back, swinging their legs forward, bending the opponent, and driving them down to the mat face, forehead, or head first. A slight variation sees the wrestler draw one of their legs backwards (usually the leg closest to the opponent) before swinging it forward to build extra momentum. They then drop onto their back, driving the opponent head first to the mat. Lita used this as her finisher and dubbed it \"Lita DDT\". Maryse calls this move \"French Kiss\". Alexa Bliss uses this move calling it \"Bliss DDT\". Yujiro Takahashi performs a variation where he delivers the DDT to a kneeling opponent, calling his version \"Pimp Juice\".\n\nThe wrestler applies a front facelock to his opponent and lifts them up with his free arm. He then falls backwards, driving the opponent vertically down to the mat head first. The Spike DDT is a version of the DDT which is somewhere between a lifting DDT and a brainbuster.\n\nThis variation sees the charging wrestler being spun into a tilt-a-whirl and ends the move up into a DDT. An inverted variation is also possible.\n\nThe tornado DDT is also referred to as a swinging/spinning DDT. A wrestler goes to the top rope and applies a front facelock to an opponent from an elevated position (for example, sitting on the top turnbuckle against an opponent standing on the mat, or from the apron against an opponent standing on the ground). The wrestler then jumps forward and swings around to fall backwards and drop the opponent's head into the mat.\n\nIn this version the fighter charges an opponent standing, jumps and applies the front facelock in the air before swinging and falling backwards having the opponent hit face first or head first into the canvas. This is sometimes known as a jumping swinging DDT and is used regularly by fighters who use a standard tornado DDT. Mickie James popularized this move under the name \"Mickie-DT\".\n\nThe wrestler applies a front facelock and lifts the opponent up into a vertical suplex and falls back driving the opponent head first into the mat. Also known as the \"brain buster\"\n\nThis subsection lists DDTs that involve the opponent being dropped on the back of their heads. The basic inverted DDT is also known as an inverted DDT.\nCommonly known as the reverse DDT. A wrestler applies an inverted facelock to his opponent, then falls backward driving the back of the opponent's head into the mat. The move was popularized by Sting in the late 1990s after he adopted it as his new finisher and named it the \"Scorpion Death Drop\".\n\nA wrestler applies an inverted facelock. Then the attacker throws his own feet backwards, falling onto his own stomach. The defending wrestler has the back of his head driven into the mat. Popularized by Christian Cage.\nThe attacking wrestler applies an Inverted facelock and puts his arm under the opponent arm completing the half nelson and drops down with the opponent's head driven into the mat\n\nThe wrestler applies an inverted facelock on the opponent with one arm, and lifts the opponent up with the other. The wrestler then falls backwards down onto their back, slightly to their side, driving the opponent down to the mat upper back and head first. This move is sometimes incorrectly referred to as an inverted DDT or a reverse DDT. Another variation used can be done where the wrestler falls on their stomach instead of their back, which is known as a lifting falling inverted DDT.\nA wrestler applies an inverted facelock to the opponent, swings either his or her legs for momentum and then falls backward driving the back of the opponent's head into the mat.\nAlso known as a backflip three-quarter facelock inverted DDT. In this move a wrestler applies a three-quarter facelock on the opponent and performs a backflip over the opponent while maintaining the facelock turning it into an inverted facelock and then either landing face down to the mat, on their own back to the side, on their knees, or in a sitting position, to drive the opponent's head back-first down to the mat. This move has several names, usually depending on the person performing it. The official name of the move used to be the \"Asai DDT\" as it was innovated by Yoshihiro Asai (Último Dragón). A sitout variation is used by former TNA wrestler Sonjay Dutt, as well as by WWE wrestler Kalisto.\n\nNJPW wrestler Tetsuya Naito uses a modified version of this move called the \"Destino\" which sees him grabbing and underhooking an opponent's single right arm with his right arm from behind while reaching under the outstretched right arm to take hold the opponent's head with his left arm while running a few short steps forward to jump performing while a backflip maintaining his hold on his opponent thus executing the maneuver.\n\nThis variation sees a wrestler lock in a front facelock and, while falling backwards, twist their opponent around resulting in the opponent landing on the back of their head, as in a standing inverted DDT. The same technique can be used to end in a falling inverted DDT. A slight variation of this sees the wrestler reach under the opponent while setting up the move to grab their far arm. From there, the wrestler pulls the arm over, causing the opponent to twist around until they are in an inverted facelock before then dropping backwards for a standard inverted DDT.\nSimilar to the normal tilt-a-whirl DDT. This DDT sees the charging wrestler being tilt-a-whirled by the opponent, after the maneuver is over, the wrestler holds the opponent into an inverted facelock, and then falling backwards while he's elevated off the mat into an inverted DDT.\nThe attacking wrestler applies an inverted facelock from an elevated position (for example, sitting on the top turnbuckle against an opponent standing on the mat, or from the apron against an opponent standing on the ground). He/she then jumps off so that he/she swings around the opponent. Using the momentum from the jump, he/she falls forwards and slams the back of the opponent's head into the mat. A standing jumping reverse tornado version of the move is also possible.\n"}

His grandfather, Franz Ulrich Bohli (1748–1810) immigrated as a young man from Vorarlberg in west part of Austria to Schönenwerd in the Canton of Solothurn in Switzerland, working as a mason for a manufacturer of silk ribbons. Later, he established his own silk ribbon manufacture in that town, relying mostly on work outsourced to local weavers.

During a business trip to Paris he visited a shoe manufacturing plant and began to think about producing shoes, founding his own small facility in 1851. \n\nAfter initial difficulties the business began to flourish and in the early 1870s he established sales organizations in Buenos Aires (Argentina), Montevideo, (Uruguay) and Paris, (France). To fill the need for workers he opened small manufacturing facilities in several towns in the surrounding region.\n\nBy 1880 Bally had transformed Schönenwerd from a sleepy farm village to an industrial center offering employment to hundreds of workers from the surrounding area, ultimately developing it into one of the w’s leading shoe manufacturing enterprises. Around the turn of the century, the firm employed some 3200 workers and produced over two million pairs of shoes a year. \n\nHe also served as a lawmaker in various local and federal positions. \n\nCarl Franz was a progressive liberal, pushing forward many new ideas in the town, now taken for granted. He and his wife opened a special education school for girls, a kindergarten, an old-age home and a public swimming facility at the bordering Aare river. He built homes for workers and converted a flood region of the Aare in town into a luscious, publicly accessible park. He fought battles to break the long established bond between school education and religion and supported the establishment of improved schooling facilities for grade schools and a regional middle school. \n\nCarl Franz and his wife Cecile Rychner (1823–1893) had two sons, Eduard and Arthur, who continued their father’s business under the name C. F. Bally Söhne. \n\nCarl Franz Bally died in Basel in 1899. \n\n"}

{"id": "2073143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073143", "title": "Darick Robertson", "text": "Darick Robertson\n\nDarick W. Robertson is an American artist best known for his work as a comic book illustrator on series he co-created, notably \"Transmetropolitan\" and \"The Boys\".\n\nRobertson has illustrated hundreds of comics in his twenty plus years in the industry. His body of work ranges from science fiction characters of his own creation to work on renowned classic characters from Marvel and DC Comics.\n\nRobertson was introduced to comics at an early age. He read Gold Key Comics found at the local barbershop and before long his father drove him to Palo Alto where young Robertson could buy weekly comics such as \"Flash\" and \"Spider-Man\". By fifth grade the young artist was already stapling together homemade comics to show to his friends. Darick Robertson cites Paul Smith, George Pérez, José Luis García-López, Neal Adams, Joe Kubert and Bernie Wrightson as early formative influences on his craft, and states it was Brian Bolland’s work on \"Camelot 3000\" that defined for him what a comic artist could aspire to. Robertson also cites Frank Miller as a hero, and hopes to eventually emulate Miller’s success as both an artist and a writer.\n\nRobertson created his first comic book at the age of 17 while still in school and also working as a bill collector. Many small-press black and white books featuring anthropomorphic heroes were seeing sudden critical and commercial success in the wake of Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird's \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\". Robertson had \"always loved this idea of stuffed animals fighting [so] they bleed and stuff comes out of them when they die.\" As a result, he created \"Space Beaver\", “a cute little beaver…running around shooting people.\"\n\nRobertson showed his new work, drawn on typing paper in ball-point pen, to Michio Okamura, an inker working as a security guard in the same building as the collection agency. Okamura inked Reggie Byers's \"Shuriken\" for Victory Comics, and introduced Darick to the use of Bristol Board, ink pens, and zip-a-tone. Okamura sent Robertson's pages to Victory Comics, who agreed to publish \"Space Beaver\", but not to compensate Robertson. Robertson then took the finished pages to Tibor Sardy, owner of Peninsula Comics in San Mateo California. After seeing Robertson's work, the comic store owner agreed to pay Robertson and publish \"Space Beaver\" under the name Ten-Buck Comics. Robertson would now spend every day after work and school drawing the book, which would run for 11 issues. Years after the series ended people still ask Robertson to confirm he was the creator of \"Space Beaver\". Robertson's father carried a worn copy of \"Space Beaver\" #1 folded into his coat pocket to show his friends what his son had created.\n\nIn 2000 Larry Young acquired permission to publish\"Space Beaver\" and AiT/Planet Lar released two trades collecting the entire run.\n\nAfter Robertson launched his career with Space Beaver, he began to regularly attend comic conventions seeking advice and professional connections. As a result, by age 21, Robertson landed his first work for a major publisher illustrating \"Justice League Quarterly\" #4 at DC Comics. He would then illustrate a run of \"Justice League Europe\" working alongside writer J. M. DeMatteis and artist/writer Keith Giffen. Over time Robertson would develop his craft finishing Giffen's panel breakdowns while working, coincidentally, on the seminal JLE story entitled \"Breakdowns\". Robertson worked on JLE issues 26, and 30-35. Later in his career Robertson would return to the Justice League to work with Mark Waid on \"Justice League: A Midsummer’s Nightmare\".\n\nAfter breaking in at DC, Robertson's first work at Marvel was \"Wolverine\" (volume 1) issue #54. Robertson would then have his first extended monthly run working with Fabian Nicieza on Marvel's \"New Warriors\" after Mark Bagley departed the book, a run Robertson recalls with pride. According to Nicieza, readers immediately took to Robertson's art despite its sharp stylistic differences from Bagley's. Robertson worked on \"New Warriors\" for two years, from issue 26 until issue 50, including writing for \"New Warriors Annual\" #3 and #4. While at Marvel, Robertson would also have a chance to work on his first iconic character – Spider-Man. Robertson illustrated \"Deadpool\" #50 and 51, which featured the first appearance of Kid Deadpool (aka Poolboy). Robertson illustrated \"Spider-man: the Power of Terror\", \"Spider-Man: The Final Adventure\" and a Spider-Man story written by Stan Lee and inked by George Pérez. This story is found collected in \"Best of Marvel 1995\". Robertson would also add additional writing credits working on \"Spectacular Spider-Man Super Special\" #1 and \"Spider-Man Team-Up\" #5.\n\nRobertson's career continued as a key creator on Malibu Comics's Ultraverse comic line. It was also his first foray into creating new characters for an existing business. At Malibu Robertson co-created and designed the character Nightman, and both wrote and created the character Ripfire. This brought about some frustration, however, as Malibu promised Robertson the rights in Nightman only to renege and sell the character to Marvel. Nightman eventually produced toys and a TV show, and Robertson later described the experience as “a sore spot.” However, while still at Malibu, Robertson met future DC and Wildstorm editor Hank Kanalz as well as a then obscure British comic writer, Warren Ellis.\n\nWhile working on a short run of Malibu's Ultraforce, Kanalz paired Robertson with emerging British comic writer Warren Ellis. Robertson enjoyed working with Ellis and contacted the writer explaining,\"\"I had the greatest time working on the [scripts]; they were funny and violent but, interesting… you ever want to work on a monthly project together, I'm all over it.\"\" Ellis agreed. When the Malibu Comics work ended, \"New Warriors\" writer and then Acclaim Comics Editor Fabian Nicieza approached Robertson about re-teaming with Ellis on a \"Solar, Man of the Atom\" special. The special became a science fiction heavy work including a two-page spread of a secret Vatican library. After the special was complete, Robertson received a phone call from Ellis asking up on that offer to work together on a monthly book.\n\n\"Transmetropolitan\" was created for DC's new Science Fiction imprint Helix. Robertson's immediate response to Ellis’ pitch was to tell the British writer \"that sounds great, I told you I'd want to work with you anytime you could.\" The future collaborators began to brainstorm on finer points of the new work, including arriving at the new name for the books lead. Helix editor Stuart Moore had worried the original name of Caleb Newcastle was \"too British\", so the collaborators settled on Spider Jerusalem.\n\nRobertson now faced a difficult choice in turning down the opportunity to draw \"Spider-Man\" monthly. A close friend pointed out to Robertson that choosing \"Transmetropolitan\" would mean he has a book that was always his, while choosing Spider-Man could make Robertson just another Spider-Man artist. Recalling his experiences with Malibu, Robertson chose the project where he would own the work. Ironically, despite Ellis's enthusiasm for Robertson's work, and the hard choice he made turning down Spider-Man, Robertson had difficulty overcoming an initial editorial perception that he was a superhero artist. Yet after a number of concept sketches and taking a firm stand, and submitting the first four pages of pencils for the first issue, Robertson was confirmed as the book's artist. Robertson described the \"Transmetropolitan\" process as \"a real collaboration […] unlike anything I've ever worked on before because there are things that I added that were never a part of the script.\" Notable contributions from Robertson include the idea of television buy bombs and the notorious Sex Puppets. Robertson even modeled Spider's ex-wife on his own wife, operating under the request that if she was drawn into the book, she didn't want the character to be anything like herself. Robertson is also behind the creation of Transmetropolitan's iconic gecko eating two headed cat. Robertson drew the cat into an alley panel after considering what strays might exist in the future. After seeing the sketch co-creator Ellis declared \"let's make it [Spider’s] pet.\"\n\nWriting for \"Wired\" magazine, Cory Doctorow called \"Transmetropolitan\" \"the graphic novel of the decade.\" Notable fans of \"Transmetropolitan\" include Patrick Stewart, Robin Williams, and writer/director Darren Aronofsky. Robertson called working on Transmetropolitan a rewarding experience, citing the critical acclaim, continued popularity of the characters and unique fandom. Robertson expresses fond memories of Ellis's scripts but he has no desire to return to Transmetropolitan. When the book ended he found no longer operating under the book's constant tight deadlines was a great relief.\n\nAfter DC shut the Helix label down, \"Transmetropolitan\" moved to Vertigo, with issue 7, where it ran for 60 issues.\n\nIn 2002, after Transmetropolitan ended, Robertson found his schedule opening up again for new projects. Former \"Transmetropolitan editor\" Axel Alonso approached Robertson with the opportunity for an exclusive deal at Marvel Comics. Robertson was instrumental in Marvel's launch of the Marvel MAX mature imprint. Alongside writer Garth Ennis, who Robertson had met through Warren Ellis, Robertson worked on \"Fury\", a hard-edged modern take on the seminal Marvel comics spy character Nick Fury which \"Rolling Stone\" hailed as \"cool comic of the year\". Robertson and Ennis developed a solid working partnership and would re-team again on a number of projects including a follow-up miniseries depicting Nick Fury during World War II entitled \" Fury: Peacemaker\". Darick also illustrated \"Spider-Man: Sweet Charity\" with veteran television writer Ron Zimmerman. Robertson referred to the book as \"his best Spider-Man work to date.\"\n\nRobertson soon collaborated again with Garth Ennis, illustrating the Ennis's 2002 run on the Marvel Knights \"Punisher\" series, in which Wolverine was mutilated by little people The next major collaboration between Robertson and Garth Ennis was \"Punisher: Born\". Originally planned as \"Punisher: The War Where I Was Born\", for the Ultimate line, the book instead became the new origin of Marvel's signature vigilante, and the starting point for Ennis's run the \"Punisher\" series published under Marvel's MAX imprint.\nNext, in 2003, Robertson was offered the opportunity to re-launch \" Wolverine\" alongside writer Greg Rucka. Robertson, a fan of Wolverine since discovering the character at age 12, accepted the offer, citing a desire to work on the high-profile X-Man for a long time. The new Wolverine series launched at number one in Diamond Comics May 2003 sales charts selling over 160,000 copies.\n\nSome controversy emerged during Robertson and Greg Rucka's run in regards to a mandate to replace Wolverine's classic squat design, which Robertson sought to develop and refine, with a design based on the 20th Century Fox X-Men movie franchise look of Wolverine portrayed by Hugh Jackman. Robertson states the Marvel request made him unhappy, but it was a company-wide choice and did not require his work to mimic the appearance of the actor exactly. Darick Robertson worked on \"Wolverine\" (Volume 3) for 14 issues.\n\nFollowing his work on Wolverine, Darick Robertson moved directly to another high-profile X-Men project. Robertson, a stated lifelong fan of X-Man character Nightcrawler, was nominated by Marvel Editor Cebulski, Robertson's collaborator on \"X-Men Unlimited\", as the artist for the fan-favorite character's first ongoing series. Robertson, who had once dressed as the teleporting X-Man for Halloween, said at the time, \"I never imagined I'd be so lucky as to move onto a Nightcrawler series on the heels of Wolverine, so in some ways it's still a childhood dream manifesting.\"\n\nWorking with series writer and playwright Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, Robertson aimed to bring the classic swashbuckler aspects of the character back to the forefront as well as explore deeper spiritual aspects of the Catholic hero. In addition to pencils Robertson took the series as an opportunity to further develop his craft in inking his own work. \" Nightcrawler\" ran 12 issues.\n\nWhile Robertson expressed disappointment in not being able to continue working on childhood favorites for Marvel, with the cancellation of Nightcrawler and his departure from Wolverine, Robertson took the opportunity to resign from his exclusivity at Marvel and reunite with Garth Ennis on a project proposed 4 years before. This project would be a super hero satire called \"The Boys\".\n\nEnnis had the project in mind for a number of years, and The Boys would permit Darick extensive creative control with the opportunity to produce an original work where he could design the characters, create the covers, and continue inking his own material. \"The Boys\", far from a simple story poking fun at superheroes would be an \"allegory about absolute power corrupting absolutely.\" To promote \"The Boys\" launch, and acting alongside comic store Isotope, Robertson gave away 10 original sketches of \"The Boys\" cast kicking the ass of the winner's choice of superhero.\n\nIn response to this project DC/Wildstorm offered Darick an exclusive contract which would also see him working on Batman and the re-launch of The Authority. However, after six issues under the DC/Wildstorm imprint the publisher elected to cancel the book despite critical acclaim and fan buzz. Robertson stated \"it became obvious that DC was not the right home for The Boys,\" though he thanked Scott Dunbier and Ben Abernathy at Wildstorm for their support. After DC released the rights for the book back to the creators, Robertson was granted an exception to his exclusivity deal so he could continue working on projects for DC, Wildstorm and Vertigo while \"The Boys\" found a new publisher.\n\n\"The Boys\" did not lack a home long as it was soon after picked up by Dynamite Entertainment in February 2007. In 2008 \"The Boys\" was nominated for an Eisner Award for Best Continuing Series as well as a GLAAD Media Award, and is now under development through Kickstart Entertainment and Original Film for Columbia Pictures. Subsequently, Columbia put The Boys into turnaround and it was picked up by Paramount Pictures Darick left the monthly art chores on \"The Boys\" with issue 43. Darick focused his attention on the six issue origin story \"Butcher, Baker, Candlestick Maker\" that focused on the BOYS central character Billy Butcher. The collected 6 issues made the New York Times bestseller list in April 2012.\n\nRobertson wrote and drew \"The Weight of the Crown\", a Conan The Barbarian one-shot for Dark Horse comics, released in January 2010, as well as a 16-page prequel to the story, originally published by Dark Horse Presents entitled \"The Mad King Of Gaul\".\n\nHe also wrote:\nThe CBLDF Presents Liberty Annual 2010 (2010)\nAnnual 2010, The CBLDF Presents: Liberty Comics (2008), Annual 2010 (Conan Variant), Malibu Signature Series (1993)\nThe New Warriors (1990) Annual 03 & Annual 04, Power Rangers (1995), Ripfire (1995) #0 - 'Genesis', Rune (1994) #3 - 'The Spoils of War', Space Beaver (1986) #1 - #11, Spider-Man (1990) Super Special 1, Spider-Man Team-Up (1995) #5, Spiderman/New Warriors: Fuerzas de la Oscuridad (1994)#4, - 'La Insoportable Oscuridad del Ser', Ultraverse Premiere (1993).\n\nIn 2012 Image Comics released the four issue mini series HAPPY! co-created with Eisner Award-winning writer Grant Morrison. Critically acclaimed and best selling, HAPPY! marks the first collaboration of Image Comics, Grant Morrison and Darick Robertson. The story centered around a beat down New York Detective turned hitman, Nick Sax, who awakes from a heart attack to a conversation with a perpetually upbeat \"Unipixisus\" (as named by Robertson's son), who calls himself \"Happy The Horse\" and takes the shape of a little blue flying donkey with a Unicorn horn. The creature is a little girl's imaginary friend and she is in danger. Only Nick Sax can save her as only Nick can see or hear Happy. It's an unusual buddy story and caught the attention of The RZA and Producer Reginald Hudlin who have expressed their desire to adapt the comic into a film. Harry Knowles' \"Ain't It Cool News\" announced Darick Robertson as one of their BEST ARTIST picks for their 9th Annual AICN COMICS @$$IE AWARDS, citing his work on HAPPY!.\n\nIn 2013 Robertson launched the 5 issue series BALLISTIC \"a psychedelic, transreal, hard sci-fi adventure\" with co-creator and writer Adam Egypt Mortimer, from Black Mask Studios.\n\nThe series was well reviewed but struggled to find an audience on its initial release. A collection is due in 2015.\n\nOLIVER is a steam-punk inspired reinterpretation of the classic Oliver Twist, set in a post apocalyptic London. It is being co-created with writer Gary Whitta based on a screenplay he wrote in 2001. OLIVER is set be published by Image Comics in 2015.\n\nRobertson currently lives in California with his wife and two children. He enjoys creating custom action figures, writing music, singing and playing the guitar.\n\n\n\n"}

Thomson was the first settler in the area known as Belmont, a suburb of Geelong and called his homestead Kardinia, a property now listed on the Register of the National Estate.\n\nThomson was the son of Alexander Thomson, a shipowner of Aberdeen, Scotland, baptised 28 March 1798. He was educated at Dr Todd's school at Tichfield, Aberdeen University, and at London, where he studied under Sir Everard Home and qualified for the medical profession. In March 1824 he married Barbara Dalrymple.\n\nIn 1825 Thomson sailed to Tasmania (then Van Diemen's Land) as a surgeon on a convict ship, the first of several voyages made by him. He was then in comfortable circumstances having been left a sum of £9500 by his mother. In 1831 he decided to settle in Tasmania, and bringing with him his wife and daughter, obtained a grant of 4000 acres (16 km²) of land.\n\nIn 1832 Thomson bought two small steamers and established a service between Hobart and Kangaroo Point. He, however, sold both vessels during the next two years. He became interested in the colonisation of Port Phillip District, but did not join the Port Phillip Association, though invited to do so, and in November 1835 he sent across the first cattle to arrive in the new settlement, a draft of 50 Hereford cows. In March 1836 Thomson arrived with his wife and daughter. He came over as medical officer and catechist for the Port Phillip Association, and built a house near the corner of Flinders and Elizabeth streets, Melbourne. In May he acted as one of three arbitrators in connexion with disputes between Henry Batman and John Pascoe Fawkner, and before his house was completed he was in the habit of holding a service on Sunday in his tent.\n\nThomson was secretary to the first public meeting held in Melbourne, on 1 June; in October William Lonsdale appointed him medical officer at a salary of £200 a year. He resigned this position in January 1837.\n\nHaving selected land on the present site of Geelong, Thomson settled there. He did some exploring, acquired more land in several localities, and in 1846 held about 150,000 acres (600 km²). He was a director of the Port Phillip bank, which was a failure, and the Port Phillip Steam Navigation Company, and he was the first to make cash advances on wool. He was foremost in every movement connected with Geelong from the removal of the bar at the mouth of the harbour to the founding of a mechanics' institute. He also took much interest in church affairs and in the well-being of the aborigines. In these matters he gave not only time, he also spent considerable sums of money.\n\nThe town was incorporated in 1849, then having 8000 inhabitants, and, as was fitting, Thomson was elected its first mayor. He field this position again in 1851, 1855, 1856 and 1857. He had been elected a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council as one of the representatives of the Electoral district of Port Phillip in 1843, but as it was difficult to attend the meetings at Sydney, soon resigned. He was active in the anti-transportation movement, in 1852 was elected a member of the Victorian Legislative Council for Geelong, and brought in and passed a bill incorporating the \"Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company\". Thomson presided at the first meeting of shareholders and was one of the directors. The line was completed in 1857. In the meanwhile Thomson had resigned his seat in the council, and visited England where he found he could get no information about the Australian colonies bills. There had been a change of ministers and Lord John Russell, now in charge of the colonial office, had gone to Vienna. Thomson followed him there, obtained an interview, and got a promise that there would be a separate constitution bill for the colony of Victoria. In May 1855 Lord John Russell sent him a copy of the bill which soon afterwards became law.\n\nIn 1857 Thomson was elected member for Geelong in the Victorian Legislative Assembly but resigned in April 1859. Thomson was elected member for Geelong East in October 1859, holding this seat until July 1861. His many activities had led to the neglect of his own financial affairs, and towards the end of his life he accepted the position of medical officer to the Sunbury boys' home. He died at Geelong on 1 January 1866 and was buried in the old Geelong cemetery. His wife and a daughter survived him.\n\nThe suburb of Thomson was named after Dr. Thomson as well as Thomson Street Belmont, the nucleus of the Belmont Heights Estate which was until the first World War, part of his extensive rural property. A parish of the Uniting Church in Australia and the Alexander Thomson Cricket Club, competing in the Geelong Cricket Association, was also named after him.\n\nAdditional resources listed by the Australian Dictionary of Biography:\n\n"}

The series was originally broadcast on BBC Three and later rerun on BBC Two. Reeves has said that the BBC do not want another series of \"Catterick\", though he may produce a spin-off centring on the DI Fowler character.\n\nThe series is named after Catterick in North Yorkshire, a village which gives it name to the nearby Catterick Garrison, Britain's largest army base.

He lives alone in their late mum's house, with only a turkey in a box for company. He had a George Clooney poster, but he ripped it in half, much to Carl's disgust. Chris does not get out much and has a habit of staring at people for no apparent reason. He has a one-man show called \"Dreams of Parsimony\" which involves him playing flute while climbing onto a chair. He also has a boomerang hidden somewhere, which he is desperate to find. His biggest ambition is to own \"luxury pets\" such as \"a soft white poodle, a lobster, a venison and a silkworm.\" He has always wanted to stay at the Mermade (sic) Hotel, which is why he and Carl end up stealing Tony's car.\n\nJust as DI Fowler below, Chris Palmer is ostensibly exactly the same as a character of the same name in \"The Club\".\n\nRoy Oates: Played by Matt Lucas, Roy Oates is the manager of the Mermade Hotel. He is a very bad-tempered man with a strange, indeterminate accent and a pony tail. He has a habit of wearing ridiculous pink boots and constantly puts his feet up on tables and chairs to appear imposing. He is blackmailing the hotel's dogsbody, Mark, with incriminating photos. He has a girlfriend, Tess, who does not really like him very much. He holds one great secret. His penis was chopped off in an incident with the hotel till, and he keeps it in a jar. He hopes to raise enough money to go to Switzerland to have an operation, but the penis gets stolen along with the contents of his safe. Later, he also gets his hand chopped off by a curved blade.\n\nTony: Played by Reece Shearsmith, Tony is a dangerous, psychotic armed robber who robs \"Neil's Wheels\" used car dealership and shoots the owner, Mr Neil Wheel. He is obsessed with keeping his mouth clean, drinking mouthwash and flossing his teeth. His Range Rover car, which contains a briefcase full of the stolen money, is eventually stolen by Chris and Carl, which provokes Tony to try to track them down and kill them. However, he is dominated by his mother, and he has to placate her before he can go on the rampage. By the end of the series, it turns out that Tony is in fact Carl's long-lost son, Paul Anthony, at which point he is supposed to be dead.\n\nTess: Played by Morwenna Banks, is the long-suffering receptionist at the Mermade Hotel. She is also Roy Oates' reluctant girlfriend. She claims that before he had his \"accident\" he was great fun (\"he even introduced me to a barrister,\"). She is drawn to Carl, but is not willing to commit. She is addicted to the \"gas\" from an asthma inhaler, which induces an extremely brief spell of euphoria. She never believes anything anyone says, usually offering a reply along the lines of \"You're tickling my turnips\" or \"You're feeling my fanny.\"\n\nMark: Played by Mark Benton, Mark is the Mermade Hotel's dogsbody. He is an amiable, mulleted and innocent sort of person. However, his time at the Mermade is miserable. He is a slave to Mr Oates, the hotel manager. After Mark caused an enormous accident at the annual flotilla the previous year, by bathing semi-clad on the rocks and being mistaken for a \"sensual woman.\" Oates captured him on camera and threatens to send the pictures to the press if Mark steps out of line. Mark also runs the Mermade Hotel's jazz-fusion disco night. He eventually helps Chris and Carl escape from the clutches of Tony and leaves the hotel.\n\nDI Keith Fowler: The intrepid \"American Eagle,\" played by Vic, DI Fowler is the determined police inspector who is finally living his dream of working for the NYPD (North Yorkshire Police Department). Certain things confuse him, however, such as the not-inconsiderable difference between a Volkswagen Golf and a Range Rover. He also mispronounces words such as \"Tupperware\" and \"Lager\" much to the confusion of everyone around. He believes the killer of Neil Wheel to be \"a loose cannon... a tithead.\" Along with his permanently baffled partner Webster (Matt Lucas) he enjoys a night on ecstasy in order to become a \"oneness\" with the suspect. He gets shot by Tony but survives and regales the nurses in his hospital of how he \"blew the lid off Tony Falucci's hydraulics scam!\"\n\nDI Fowler is fundamentally the same character as Kinky John from \"The Club\" sketches from \"Bang Bang, It's Reeves and Mortimer\" - although his profession and name differ, the look (including thick-lensed glasses), the voice and accent, and the demeanour are the same.\n\nDan, Dan The Shellfish Man: Played by Lucas, Dan is a very enthusiastic Cockney shellfish retailer, who specialises in cockles, whelks, winkles and crabsticks. He is, according to Chris, \"a nosy git\" and helps Carl out in his search for his son. Dan is the only man who knows where Chris' boomerang is.\n\nIan: Played by Tim Healy, Ian is one of the regulars in the Siberian Khatru pub in Northallerton. He is very talkative and likes sharing his bizarre stories with anyone within earshot. He very nearly joined a black rock-funk band, \"sort of like Osibisa\" but decided to stay home and look after his wife, who is freezing cold to the touch and has to be constantly kept warm with electric heaters. Ian finally comes to the realization that his wife has been dead for quite some time, but believes that it could have been the journey to the hospital that truly finished her off.\n\nPat The Barman: Played by Charlie Higson, Pat is the grumpy barman of the Siberian Khatru. He is constantly trying to serve his own brand of van-flattened Spatchcock.\n\nSergeant Minge-Munchington: (Steve Furst) one of DI Fowler's hapless officers.\n\nTony's Mum: Tony's mum (Julie T. Wallace) is very concerned about her son's behaviour, but is more than willing to give him what for if he steps out of line.\n\nDerek seems to be another refugee from \"Bang Bang, It's Reeves and Mortimer\", originally appearing as Tom Fun's dolorous side-kick in the 'Fun Fun Fun' sketches. In \"Catterick\", his appearance is identical to the earlier incarnation, but his voice and general behaviour are altogether more manic.\n\nGlen: (Frank Jarvis) Another one of the regulars at the Siberian Khatru, Glen never says a word, remains in his wheelchair, and always has a look of shock and awe on his face. He does get excited, however, at the prospect of crabsticks.\n\nThe varied soundtrack featured original music, with Jeff Beck on guitar, and was idiosyncratic in its use of popular music. As well as using songs to punctuate important moments in the plot, or to add surreality - such as the use of \"Kinky Boots\" by Patrick Macnee and Honor Blackman for many of Roy Oates' entrances - once an episode, characters would begin spontaneously lip-synching to songs. These were:\n\n\nThe theme tune from Vic and Bob's short-lived BBC1 gameshow, \"Families at War\", can be heard playing at Mark's disco featured in the second episode of the series.\n\n\nThe British Prog-rock group Crippled Black Phoenix sampled Reeve's character DI Fowler in the song \"Laying Traps\" on the 2012 album \"(Mankind) The Crafty Ape\".\n\n"}

It monitored, translated, and disseminated within the U.S. government openly available news and information from media sources outside the United States. Its headquarters was in Rosslyn, Virginia , later Reston, Virginia , and it maintained approximately 20 monitoring stations worldwide. In November 2005, it was announced that FBIS would become the newly formed Open Source Center, tasked with the collection and analysis of freely available intelligence.\n\nOn 26 February 1941, President Roosevelt directed that $150,000 be allocated for creation of the Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service (FBMS) under the authority of the Federal Communications Commission. The mandate of the FBMS was to record, translate, transcribe and analyze shortwave propaganda radio programs that were being beamed at the United States by the Axis powers. Its first monitoring station was established in October 1941 in Portland, Oregon.\n\nThe year following the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the system gained importance and changed its name to The Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service.\n\nAt four different listening centers it recorded short-wave broadcasts on plastic disks. Selected material was transcribed and translated and then sent to War agencies with weekly reports. These special reports included special titles such as \"Radio Tokyo's Racial Propaganda to the United States, Underground Movements and Morale in Japan,\" and \"New Nazi Portrait of the American Soldier.\" Monitored stations included official stations in many countries, and \"black\" stations that weren't what they pretended be. These black stations broadcast attacks on President Franklin D. Roosevelt while pretending to be stations in the American Midwest. This tactic was used to stir up race tensions and other issues.\n\nMultiple speeches and recording were monitored including speeches by Adolf Hitler, Joseph Goebbels, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Benito Mussolini, Philippe Pétain, Pierre Laval, and others; broadcasts over German radio by American citizens, including Fred W. Kaltenbach, Douglas Chandler, and Edward Leo Delaney; and broadcasts from Japan or Japanese-held territory, including news reports and commentary by \"Tokyo Rose.\" The FBIS kept track of a total of sixty \"black\" stations, which included a German-language station that pretended to represent an anti-Nazi army group, an anti-Nazi \"Catholic\" station, and an English-language station that attacked Winston Churchill.\n\nWith the end of World War II, the service was transferred to the Department of the Army. Like many other wartime organizations, the service was threatened with disbandment. The possibility of its disbandment was roundly criticized in many different quarters, which helped ensure its survival.\n\nUpon the passing of the National Security Act of 1947, the service was renamed the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) as a part of the CIA. Its original mission revolved around radio and press agency monitoring.\n\nIn response to the Cuban Missile Crisis and START Treaty, FBIS was tasked with monitoring for clandestine and encoded messages from all nations and coordinating broadcast media contact points who could instantly broadcast urgent messages on \"All Channels\" and \"All Calls\".\n\nIn 1967, the Service's mission was expanded to cover foreign mass media transmitted by radio, television, and print.\n\nIn 2007, Readex announced its plans to create a digital edition entitled Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) Daily Reports, 1941–1996. As of March 2017, this collection is available online via a paid subscription to Readex, as are Daily Report Annexes for 1974-1996.\n\nFBIS had approximately 20 stations, commonly called bureaus, that were located around the world. These stations operated as an adjunct of a U.S. embassy/consulate or military command. Bureaus opened and closed at various times depending on the world situation and local circumstances. These stations were not covert and operated with the consent of the host government. In addition, a few of the bureaus were located on territory belonging to or administered by the US such as Key West, Florida, Bahia Sucia, Puerto Rico, the Panama Canal Zone, etc. The personnel in the stations were both U.S. citizens and foreign nationals who were responsible for the collection, translation, and dissemination of foreign open source material. Depending on location, and the availability of print media, these personnel may have been responsible for translation of more than one language. Because of the large number print/radio/TV/satellite sources worldwide FBIS did not collect all open source material, but only those sources that met the requirements of the Intelligence Community.\n\nBesides the translations done overseas a large volume of less-time sensitive material was sent to FBIS headquarters in Rosslyn and Reston where a more detailed translation could take place.\n\nNot only were translations provided by in-house FBIS personnel, but approximately 700 independent contractors were also employed.\n\nMaterial provided by FBIS was disseminated to over 700 recipients in not only in the U.S. Intelligence Community, but also a large number of government, diplomatic and military organizations.\n\nThe material provided by FBIS, although it comes from openly available, public radio and TV broadcasts, is not made freely available to the American people, frequently due to copyright laws.\n\nThe Federation of American Scientists launched a successful campaign in 1997 to save FBIS from planned budget cuts.\n\nLarry Wu-Tai Chin worked for FBIS from 1952 to 1981 and sold classified documents to China.\n\nOffice of National Assessments Open Source Centre, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.\n\nBBC Monitoring\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2073193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073193", "title": "Austrian National Library", "text": "Austrian National Library\n\nThe Austrian National Library () is the largest library in Austria, with more than 12 million items in its various collections. The library is located in the Neue Burg Wing of the Hofburg in center of Vienna. Since 2005, some of the collections have been relocated within the Baroque structure of the Palais Mollard-Clary. Founded by the Habsburgs, the library was originally called the Imperial Court Library (); the change to the current name occurred in 1920, following the end of the Habsburg Monarchy and the proclamation of the Austrian Republic. The library complex includes four museums, as well as multiple special collections and archives.\n\nThe institution has its origin in the imperial library of the Middle Ages. During the Medieval period, the Austrian Duke Albert III (1349–1395) moved the books of the Viennese vaults into a library. Albert also arranged for important works from Latin to be translated into German. In the Hofburg, the treasure of Archduke Albert III had been kept in sacristies inside the south tower of the imperial chapel. The Archduke was a connoisseur of art; he supported the University of Vienna, and he founded a royal workshop for illustrating manuscripts. The oldest book on record at the library, the 1368 golden Holy Gospels, was owned by Albert III; in 1368, Johannes of Troppau, priest at Landskron and canon in Brno, transcribed the four Gospels of the Bible in gold letters with detailed illustrations in the school of Burgundian book art. On scenes depicting the lives of the four Evangelists, four coats of arms show the House of Austria, Tirol, Styria, and Carinthia, the lands which Archduke Albrecht III had ruled at the time.\n\nFrederick III, Holy Roman Emperor (1415–1493), had the goal of consolidating the art treasures among the Habsburg possessions. Among other things, he brought some valuable books into the Vienna, among them the \"Prager Wenzelsbibel\" and the document of the golden bull.\n\nThrough his marriage with Mary of Burgundy, Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor (1459–1519) came into possession of important books from Burgundy and north France, and brought these to Wiener Neustadt. With a value at that time estimated at 100,000 guldens, these books represented about an eighth of Mary's dowry. Also Maximilian's second wife, Bianca Maria Sforza, brought into the marriage books from Italian workshops as part of her dowry.\n\nAt that time the books of the library were kept partially in Wiener Neustadt, partially in Vienna, and partially in Innsbruck. After the death of Maximilian, the books were sent to the palace at Innsbruck. In addition to the valuable books from the public treasury, the Bibliotheca Regia, which collected and categorized scientific works, was developed in Vienna during the 16th century. Besides books, that library also contained globes and atlases. Over time the library expanded thanks to donations from the personal libraries of individual scholars.\n\nThe first head librarian, Hugo Blotius, was appointed in 1575 by Emperor Maximilian II. His most important task was drawing up the inventory of the library, which had grown to approximately 9,000 books. As a consequence, new works were added systematically, and other libraries were incorporated.\n\nOn 26 August 1624, delivery of copies was regulated by order of Ferdinand II. The Imperial Library also increased by purchases. In particular, the library of Philipp Eduard Fugger led to a major expansion. The library currently has about 17,000 sheets of one of the first periodic printing elements, the Fugger newspapers, from the Fugger library.\n\nIn 1722, Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor authorised the construction of a permanent home for the library in the Hofburg palace, after the plans of Leopold I. The wing was begun by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach and started accommodating the library in the 18th century.\n\nThe most valuable addition at that time was the extensive collection of Prince Eugene of Savoy, whose 15,000 volumes included valuable books from France and Italy. The State Hall of the library housed about 200,000 books at this point.\n\nDuring the reorganization there was for the first time criticism regarding the fact that the library served mainly as representation rather than the search for knowledge. Doctor Gerard van Swieten, physician to Maria Theresia, and his son Gottfried van Swieten supplemented the collection with numerous scientific works. Gottfried van Swieten also successfully introduced the card index. This facilitated the continuous updating of the inventory.\n\nAfter the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved by Napoleon and the Austrian Empire proclaimed in its place, the library was again reorganized. Under custodian Paul Strattmann, the library received a program for the first time which described its order; the library gained a three-way viewpoint:\n\nThe collection politics of the Imperial Library separated at the beginning the 19th century appreciably due to the requirements of the representation and its attention to scientific works. The multinational condition of the Austrian Empire brought with itself that, not only German-language books were collected, but also books of the Slavic and Hungarian linguistic area. Substantial parts of the Hungarian collection moved to Budapest, however, after reconciliation with Hungary. During the March revolution of 1848, the Imperial Library was in extreme danger, when after the bombardment of Vienna caused the burning of the Hofburg, in which the Imperial Library was located.\n\nAn important addition to the Imperial Library is the papyrus collection, which goes back to the acquisitions of the Viennese of antique dealer Theodor Graf.\n\nAfter the proclamation of the Republic of Austria, the Imperial Library was renamed in 1920 as the Austrian National Library.\nThe collection politics of intermediate wartime concentrated on \"the national literature of those German trunks, which came now under foreign-national rule.\" The director at that time of the library was Josef Donabaum. Under the line of the general manager, Paul Heigl, during the Nazi period (\"NS-zeit\"), hundreds of thousands of writings were accommodated here or the library served for majority the worthless, but seized works as transit camps into German libraries.\n\n\"The historical heritage of the Austrian National Library is not free of injustice and guilt. That is true in a particular manner of the period of National Socialism. Led by a fanatical National Socialist, Paul Heigl, the National Library was an active participant on a grand scale in the systematic robbing in the first place of Jewish citizens, but also of other victims of the Nazi regime. Despite considerable restitutions in the post-war years major portions of the looted collections remained in the Library. So the earliest possible restitution of those holdings to their legitimate possessors is for the Austrian National Library not only a duty under law, but also a moral question. With the Federal Law on Restitution of Art Objects in 1998, the basis, long since necessary, was created. In December 2003, after careful examination of all relevant holdings, the Austrian National Library completed its report on provenance according to the Law on Restitution of Art Objects of 1998, and handed it over to the Commission for Provenance. The essential findings are lists of illegal acquisitions during the Nazi period which are still in the possession of the Austrian National Library. Since then the Austrian National Library has taken pains to find the legitimate owners or inheritors, so as to give back the objects as quickly as possible. Since December of 2003 a total of 32,937 objects have been restored to their lawful owners.\"\n\nRenamed again into the Austrian National Library after 1945, small parts were returned again, but the majority remained in the collections. The attention of the collection activity was directed again in small steps toward Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nIn 1966, large parts of the collections were moved from the building at Josefsplatz to the premises of the Neue Burg wing at Heldenplatz, where new reading halls were set up. Due to the rising space requirement in 1992, the library opened up to approximately 4 million works. Wider ranges for reading halls were furnished at the same time, so that three levels are currently at the disposal of visitors (two floors of the main reading hall and the magazine reading hall).\n\nFor an extensive amount of time, the library used a card-catalog index. Since 1995, an electronic system has been in place, which went online in 1998. As of 2001, books confiscated from Jewish Austrians during World War II have been slowly returned to the heirs. It is estimated that nearly 25,000 works fall into this category.\n\nOn 1 January 2002 the library gained the full legal capacity to dismiss staff. This brought the full control to the mechanism in budget and personnel questions. The library has a certain part of its budget funded by the state; additional funds must be raised by sponsorships, reproduction services, and the loaning from the premises. Organizationally, the library uses a central management and has three chief departments (personnel and accounting, inventory structure and treatment, as well as use and information), plus the individual collections.\n\nThe head of the library reports to a board of trustees on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe Prunksaal () is the central structure of the old imperial library and part of the Hofburg palace. The wing is located in-between Josephsplatz to the north and the Burggarten to the south.\n\nThe books in the monastery of the Conventual Franciscans (Minoritenkloster) were stored here. The wing was begun in 1721 by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach and finished after his death in 1723 by his son Joseph Emanuel.\n\nThe sculptures on the wing are by Lorenzo Mattielli. The hall is divided, after the original list of the books, into two opposite \"war\" and \"peace\" sides, which is reflected also in the wall frescoes, from Daniel Gran. The fresco in the central dome represents a kind Apotheosis of Emperor Charles VI, whose image is held by Hercules and Apollo. Around the image of the emperor, several types of allegorical figures meet in a complicated theme, which symbolize the virtues of the Habsburgs and the wealth of their domains.\n\nLocated in the hall are marble statues of emperors with the statue of emperor Charles VI in its centre, created by the sculptors Peter Strudel and Paul Strudel. The four large globes are by Vincenzo Coronelli.\n\nDuring the reign of empress Maria Theresia, cracks started appearing in the dome, in which Court architect Nikolaus Pacassi soon strengthened the dome with an iron ring. The memorial fresco of Gran (in which the trace of a tear can be seen) was restored by Franz Anton Maulbertsch.\n\nAlso during her reign, the wing was extended on both ends, connecting the central Prunksaal with the Hofburg and St. Augustine's Church, forming Josefsplatz (Joseph Square).\n\nOne of the major tasks of the Austrian National Library is the collection and archiving of all publications appearing in Austria (including electronic media). Depending on the law for the medium, four copies, and by other printing elements, two obligation copies each, must be delivered to the National Library by periodic printing elements appearing in Austria.\n\nIn addition, the library collects all works of Austrian authors appearing abroad, as well as such works which concern Austrians or the Austrian spirit and culture. Further publications from the foreign country are taken up with emphasis on the range of the \"Geisteswissenschaften\". Tasks and services of the national library cover the development of the existence and their supply in the form of local-loan, remote-loan, and search services as well as Auskunfts, information and reproduction services.\n\nThe legally given general order for education is obeyed also by co-operation with universities, schools and adult education mechanisms.\n\nAltogether, the library has more than seven million objects, of which approximately three million are printed.\n\nDating from the 4th century CE to the present, this collection includes antique, medieval and modern manuscripts from almost every literate culture. Notable items in the collection include the Vienna Dioscurides, which was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme Register in 1997 in recognition of its world significance and outstanding universal value.\n\nThe map collection includes maps back to the 16th century and it has existed since 1905. After the First World War, the collection of the Habsburgs was taken over, designated as the Habsburg \"Family Estate Library\" (Familien-Fideikommiss-Bibliothek).\n\nThe map collection includes the Globe Museum, containing over 380 globes, some dating back to the 16th century. It is the world's only public globe museum, and has been in existence since 1956. The principal part of the Globe Museum's inventory consists of globes which existed before 1850. There is also technical literature in the collection, plus similar instruments, such as armillary spheres.\n\nThe map collection also includes the 17th century Atlas Blaeu-Van der Hem, a 50-volume set that consists of more than 2,400 maps, prints, and drawings. Considered the most beautiful and most remarkable atlas ever composed, it includes four volumes of manuscript maps and topographical drawings originally made for the Dutch East India Company (VOC). It was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme Register in 2003.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the papyrus collection became an important part of the library. The collection goes back to a private collection of Austrian Archduke Rainer, who gave the collection to Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria on 18 August 1899. The Papyrus collection contains about 180,000 objects from the period between that of the 15th Century BCE and the 16th Century CE. Besides papyri the collection includes papers, records on clay tablets, inscribed wood and wax trays, stone tablets, leathers, textiles and bones, as well as gold, silver and bronze articles with inscriptions. The Papyrus collection (Collection Archduke Rainer) is the largest such collection worldwide, and was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme Register in 2001.\n\nThe Papyrus Museum, located in the library in the Neue Burg wing of the Hofburg Palace, has around 200 objects from the collection on display.\n\nSince 1826, the music collection contains numerous scores and first-printings of works of well-known composers, such as Anton Bruckner or Richard Strauss. Numerous recordings such as records or CDs are kept as well. Among the music collection are also many handwritten notes of composers.\n\nContaining old and valuable printings, the collection of Incunabula is one of the five largest collections of historical block printing of the world. As an independent collection, it has existed since 1995 and ranks thereby among the youngest of the library. The collection covers approximately 8,000 incunabula (the fourth largest in existence worldwide), block printings from 1501 to 1850 (e.g. the Fugger newspapers), and bibliophile as well as rare and valuable printings without temporal restriction. The SIAWD collection has also been supplemented with Chinese and Japanese printings.\n\nThe Department of Planned Languages and Esperanto Museum incorporates a collection of materials related to planned languages.\n\nThe Department of the Library which collects, digitizes and works to promote publications on women and gender studies is known as \"Ariadne\". Founded in 1992, the department digitized its materials in 2000 and works to improve the visibility of women's contributions to society and in the history of Austria.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2073194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073194", "title": "Where the Action Is", "text": "Where the Action Is\n\nWhere the Action Is is a music-based television variety show that aired in the United States from 1965 to 1967. It was carried by the ABC network and aired each weekday afternoon. Created by Dick Clark as a spin-off of \"American Bandstand\", \"Where the Action Is\" premiered on June 27, 1965. The show was another step in the then-current trend of entertainment programs that targeted the teenage audience by focusing on pop music, following in the footsteps of \"Shindig!\" (premiered in the fall of 1964, also on ABC) and \"Hullabaloo\" (premiered January 1965 on NBC). Dick Clark's voice could be heard doing the artist introductions, and he sometimes did filmed interviews.\n\nThe show was hosted by Linda Scott and Steve Alaimo, who sang numbers between guest performances. Ms. Scott had a few hit singles as a teenager in the early 1960s; she was only 20 when \"Action\" premiered. Also appearing were Keith Allison (a Paul McCartney look-alike who later became a member of Paul Revere and the Raiders) and Laura Nyro. Typically, the show featured two or three performers lip-synching their recent hits with a bunch of teenagers clapping and swaying in the background, and a dance segment featuring the Action dancers. There would occasionally be an interview segment. A few episodes featured only one performer, such as Herman's Hermits or James Brown.\n\nOriginally intended as a summer replacement and broadcast at 2 P.M. EDT, the show was successful enough for it to continue throughout the 1965–66 TV season, with a change in time period to 4:30 P.M. Eastern time following the horror soap opera \"Dark Shadows\". Both programs attracted a young audience who watched the shows after school. It was in black and white.\n\nThe show's theme song, \"Action\", became a hit single for Freddy \"Boom Boom\" Cannon, peaking on the charts (#13) in September 1965. Most of these black-and-white telecasts were taped at various locales in Southern California. A handful of segments were taped elsewhere around The United States. The theme song was written by Steve Venet and Tommy Boyce. Later, Boyce co-wrote songs for The Monkees.\n\nThe program had its own stable of performers, most notably Paul Revere & the Raiders, who served as the \"de facto\" house band. Easily identified by their Revolutionary War costumes, the band had several Top 40 hits in the '60s thanks in part to the exposure they received on \"Where The Action Is\". Their lead singer, Mark Lindsay, with his signature ponytail, became one of the most popular teenage idols of the decade, gracing the covers of countless teen magazines. The Raiders also recorded the \"Action\" theme song for their 1965 album \"Just Like Us\" for which Dick Clark wrote the liner notes. When the group departed the show in 1966, they were replaced by The Robbs and The Hard Times. Other regular performers on \"Action\" included the dance troupe Pete Manifee and the Action Kids. Individual episodes featured a wide range of guest performers, as detailed below. Tina Mason was a regular singer being promoted by Dick Clark on the show. She met and later married Phil Volk, the bass player for Paul Revere and the Raiders, whom she met on the \"Action\" set. They married on the second anniversary of the show's premiere, June 27, 1967.\n\nThe weekday program was cancelled on March 31, 1967, with the network giving its local affiliates the time slot. However, members of the program's mainstay band Paul Revere and the Raiders (with lead vocalist Mark Lindsay) hosted very similar follow-up shows; both Revere and Lindsay hosted \"Happening '68\", a Saturday afternoon follow-up to \"American Bandstand\", and a weekday version of the same show, \"It's Happening\", from 1968 to 1969. Both shows were produced by Dick Clark's production company for ABC.\n\n\n \n"}

In February 2018, owner JAB Holding Company agreed to sell a majority controlling stake to Chinese materials conglomerate Shandong Ruyi.\n\nBally was founded by Carl Franz Bally and his brother Fritz in the basement of their family home in Schönenwerd in the Canton of Solothurn, Switzerland. The original family business was the manufacture of elastic ribbon.\n\nDuring a business trip to Paris in 1849, Carl Franz wanted to buy his wife some lace-up booties - the popular shoe of the day. Unable to recall her exact size, he decided to buy twelve pairs in a range of sizes, knowing that one would certainly fit. Upon visiting the Parisian factory where the booties were made, he noticed that each shoe featured buttons with elastic closures similar to the kind his family produced in Switzerland. Inspired by the possibility of creating more jobs and improving the lives of local residents, he decided to expand his business into shoe production. Together with his brother Fritz, Carl Franz employed designers to assist and they began producing shoes made entirely by hand in the cellar of his Schönenwerd home.\n\nThe Bally Company was established in Schönenwerd in 1851 and three years later the first factory located in the village centre was built. In 1854, Fritz Bally retired. By the 1870s, Bally was recognised as a footwear industry leader. The company’s name changed to C. F. Bally, and then to C. F. Bally & Sons when the brand’s founding pioneer handed the company reins to his sons in 1892. Carl Franz died in 1899 but undeniably passed on his pioneering spirit to his sons. Bally grew internationally and opened stores in Geneva, in Buenos Aires (1873), followed by Paris (1879) and London (1882). In the 1980s, Bally was also one of the very first European luxury goods brands to open in post-reform and opening China. By now the brand had also extended its offering to include clothing, handbags and leather goods for both men and women (1976), and in 1990 would become truly global, opening in Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Lebanon and Turkey.\n\nBally is currently under the leadership of CEO Frédéric de Narp (November 2013), with Pablo Coppola as Design Director (February, 2014) and parent company JAB Holdings at the helm.\n\nIn 2008 TPG Capital sold Bally International AG to Vienna, Austria-based Labelux Group, a luxury goods holding firm which also owns Jimmy Choo Ltd. and was founded by the German billionaire Reimann family as part of the family’s investment arm Joh A. Benckiser.\n\nHeadquartered in Caslano, Ticino, Switzerland, the company announced that Frédéric de Narp, a former executive at Harry Winston, would become its chief executive officer in November 2013. In February 2018 owner JAB Holding Company agreed to sell a majority controlling stake to Chinese materials conglomerate Shandong Ruyi.\n\n\n\n\n\nBally has 12 boutiques in the United States, including: Atlanta, Aventura, Beverly Hills, Costa Mesa, Dallas -(Northpark), Honolulu, Houston, Las Vegas, McLean, Miami, New York City, and Troy, Michigan, as well as in Polanco, Mexico City. Bally also hosts 3 outlet stores in the United States as well.\n\nBally House in Schönenwerd has been built by architect Karl Moser. As most of the employees of Bally factory were coming from the nearby villages and had a longer working way, it was important for the owners to provide the possibility of healthy food. At first a small cantine was built in 1879, and then in 1915 it was decided to build a bigger building in the middle of the park.\n\nKarl Moser has built a two-story classic building that included cantine for the employees, as well as the rooms for the employees, showers and bathrooms. Among the people the house was named Parkhotel.\n\nNowadays the building and the park around is under the protection of canton and is being used for different events.\n"}

It is the continuation of a successful 1970s glam rock outfit, Catapult; its members also formed a successful production and songwriting team, Cat Music, responsible for a number of Dutch hit songs.\n\nThe band was formed by various ex-members of a rock combo called Catapult, which split up in the early 1980s. Catapult had scored a number of hits in the late 1970s playing a form of glam rock; \"Let your hair hang down\" and \"Teeny Bopper Band\" were two of the band's hits. After their popularity faded, the band split up and its members formed a production company, Cat Music, specializing in producing various bands (including hard rock act Picture) and occasional one-hit wonders. They became quite adept at songwriting; Andre Hazes recorded three of their songs for his album \"Gewoon André\", including the number-one hit \"Een Beetje Verliefd\". The members did form a number of other bands, one of which, The Monotones, had a hit in Germany and the Netherlands with the song \"Mono\". Rubberen Robbie was their vehicle for parody and carnival songs.\n\nOne of the band's most popular songs, \"De Nederlandse Sterre Die Strale Overal\" (\"Dutch Stars Shine Everywhere\"), was a medley of verses adapted and butchered from Dutch hit songs; the very idea of such a compilation parodied a slew of hits by the Dutch novelty pop act Stars on 45; it sold 60,000 copies in three weeks and earned the band number one status on the Dutch charts. The band is hailed as one of the best acts from Leiden; their song \"3 Oktoberrr\" is a perennial favorite at the Leids 3 October Festival (the triple r in the song title is a reference to the Leiden dialect, with its peculiar pronunciation of that phoneme). Almost thirty years later the song was still ranked 62 in the top 500 songs of Omroep West, the regional radio station. Other well-known songs by the band include a parody of the Dutch classic levenslied \"Zuiderzeeballade\", and the song \"Marie\" (about a guy complaining that his girlfriend left him, even though he didn't cheat on her more than once a week), which is cited as an example of what the Leiden dialect sounds like.\n\nThe band remains popular as a live act. Since the mid-2000s, singer Cees Bergman plays live concerts with a classic rock band, Van Beukenstein. Maximum Overdrive is a cover band playing Rubberen Robbie songs.\n\n"}

C. Fields, featuring Joseph Calleia, Ruth Donnelly, Margaret Hamilton, Donald Meek, Willard Robertson, Dick Foran, William B. Davidson, and Addison Richards, and released by Universal Pictures. It was directed by Edward F. Cline and the music was written by Ben Oakland (song \"Willie of the Valley\") and Frank Skinner.\n\nWest reportedly wrote the original screenplay, with Fields contributing one extended scene set in a bar. Universal decided to give the stars equal screenplay credit, perhaps to avoid the appearance of favoritism, but the move incensed West, who declined to team with Fields afterwards. The stars spoofed themselves and the Western genre, with West providing a series of her trademark double entendres.\n\nIn the American Old West of the 1880s, Miss Flower Belle Lee (Mae West), a singer from Chicago, is on her way to visit relatives. While she is traveling on a stagecoach with three men and a woman named Mrs. Gideon (Margaret Hamilton), the town gossip and busybody, a masked bandit on horseback holds up the stage for its shipment of gold and orders the passengers to step out.\n\nThe masked bandit immediately takes an interest in the saucy blonde. As he makes his getaway with the gold, he takes her with him. Upon reaching the town of Little Bend, the others report the robbery and kidnapping to the sheriff (William B. Davidson). Flower Belle then walks into town, unharmed, and explains, \"I was in a tight spot but I managed to wiggle out of it.\"\n\nLater that evening, at the home of her Aunt Lou (Ruth Donnelly) and Uncle John (Willard Robertson), the masked bandit enters Flower Belle's second floor bedroom and they start kissing. However, his presence and departure is witnessed by Mrs. Gideon. She quickly reports what she has seen and Flower Belle is annoyed to find herself hauled up before the judge (Addison Richards). Offended by her indifferent manner, the judge asks angrily \"Young lady, are you trying to show contempt for this court?\" She answers: \"No, I'm doing my best to hide it!\" Flower Belle is then run out of Little Bend.\n\nShe boards a train to Greasewood City. It makes an unscheduled stop to pick up con-man Cuthbert J. Twillie (W. C. Fields). When hostile Indians attack, Flower Belle saunters to a window and mows them down with two pistols, while Twillie dodges flying arrows and fights off the Indians with a child's slingshot. Flower Belle has little use for Twillie until she sees a stash of money in his bag. Believing him to be rich, she then plays up to him and they get acquainted. They have an impromptu wedding, officiated over by a passenger, Amos Budge (Donald Meek), a gambler who looks like a minister.\n\nAs she has only pretended to marry Twillie for \"respectability\", Flower Belle gets a separate hotel room in Greasewood City. Meanwhile, Twillie is made sheriff by the saloon owner and town boss Jeff Badger (Joseph Calleia), who has an ulterior motive: he hopes the new sheriff, who is clearly incompetent, will be unable to interfere with Badger's crimes. Flower Belle attracts the attention of Badger, newspaper editor Wayne Carter (Dick Foran), and every other man in town. While keeping her troublesome \"husband\" out of reach and out of trouble, Flower Belle encounters the masked bandit again. At one point, she kisses Badger, and recognizes that Badger is the masked bandit, musing: \"That man's kiss is like a signature.\"\n\nTwillie attempts to consummate his \"marriage\" with Flower Belle, but she escapes and leaves a goat in their bed. Twillie, unaware of the substitution, attempts to make love to the goat, and is surprised when he discovers that it is not his wife.\n\nOne night, Twillie again attempts to consummate his \"marriage\" by entering Flower Belle's room disguised as the masked bandit. He is caught, accused of being the masked bandit, and is about to be hanged. With the noose around his neck, he makes his last request to the lynching party. \"I'd like to see Paris before I die. Philadelphia will do!\" \n\nHowever, Flower Belle saves Twillie.\n\n\nShooting on \"My Little Chickadee\" was completed in January 1940. West and Fields received joint screenplay credit, however, West later claimed that she wrote most of the film and that Fields only wrote some of the scenes, such as the bar scene, and some dialogue and was given joint credit as an inducement to \"straighten himself up and finish the picture\". The film was heavily censored, with many scenes and lines of dialogue ordered to be cut or altered. It opened just one month later and became Fields' highest-grossing film for Universal. Reportedly, West and Fields did not like each other, and would not speak to each other except during filming. Reviews were mixed, but Fields performance was praised across the board, while West's was criticized. She was so furious that she refused to work with Fields ever again or even to talk to him or about him. \n\nFields had starred in a series of comedies for Paramount in the 1930s. \"My Little Chickadee\" was West's first screen performance since \"Every Day's a Holiday\" (1937) for Paramount Pictures. This was Fields' second film for Universal, and West's only film for Universal. It was also the last successful film of West's career; her three subsequent films all failed at the box office.\n\n\"My Little Chickadee\" was the third of five films starring Fields and directed by Edward F. Cline, an ex-Keystone Cop. The others were \"Million Dollar Legs\" (1932), \"You Can't Cheat an Honest Man,\" \"The Bank Dick\" (1940), and \"Never Give a Sucker an Even Break\" (1941).\n\nFrank S. Nugent reviewed the film negatively for \"The New York Times\", writing that \"the film is at low tide most of the time in the quality of its humor, in the broad treatment its players and directors have given it, in the caliber of the audience it seems intended to please and in the generally bad odor it exudes.\" \"Variety\" wrote that the film \"has its sagging moments, and the slim basic story cannot be taken seriously at any point. But there's sufficient broad humor and elemental comedy to satisfy generally.\" \"Harrison's Reports\" wrote that West and Fields \"play up to each other very well and make a good team. Due to their efforts the picture offers good mass entertainment, in spite of the fact that the story is thin.\" \"Film Daily\" wrote that it was \"all lusty fun\" with \"some amusing gags and situations.\" John Mosher of \"The New Yorker\" called West \"as fresh and ebullient as ever\" after her two-year absence from the screen.\n\n\"My Little Chickadee\" was a box office success, earning $2 million in gross receipts.\n\n\n"}

He studied piano under Antoine Marmontel, his career beginning at the age of seven in Paris. While there he met and befriended many like-minded musicians who would have a long-lasting effect on his career. These included Franz Liszt, with whom he played arrangements of two of Liszt's symphonic poems (\"Les Préludes\", and \"Tasso, Lamento e Trionfo\") for 2 pianos, Hector Berlioz, Gioachino Rossini, Charles Gounod, Felix Mendelssohn, Sigismond Thalberg and Charles-Marie Widor. It is also known that he himself heard Frédéric Chopin play, and because of this, his recordings - and indeed the one film available of him - are seen as a link to a 'lost world' of piano performance.\n\nHe toured the concert platforms of Europe after leaving Paris, expanding his reputation for quality of tone and virtuosic, emotional interpretations. The death of his wife in 1908 resulted in him retiring from the stage, except for charity performances and concerts in aid of those wounded in the First World War. He had many pupils, including Alexander Brailowsky.

Each year, this facility hosts hundreds of researchers from universities, national laboratories, and industry, who conduct basic and applied research and technology development using neutrons. SNS is part of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which is managed by UT-Battelle for the United States Department of Energy (DOE). SNS is a DOE Office of Science user facility, and it is open to scientists and researchers from all over the world.\n\nNeutron scattering allows scientists to count scattered neutrons, measure their energies and the angles at which they scatter, and map their final positions. This information can reveal the molecular and magnetic structure and behavior of materials, such as high-temperature superconductors, polymers, metals, and biological samples. In addition to studies focused on fundamental physics, neutron scattering research has applications in structural biology and biotechnology, magnetism and superconductivity, chemical and engineering materials, nanotechnology, complex fluids, and others.\n\nThe spallation process at SNS begins with negatively charged hydrogen ions that are produced by an ion source. Each ion consists of a proton orbited by two electrons. The ions are injected into a linear particle accelerator, or linac, which accelerates them to an energy of about one GeV (or to about 90% the speed of light). The ions pass through a foil, which strips off each ion's two electrons, converting it to a proton. The protons pass into a ring-shaped structure, a proton accumulator ring, where they spin around at very high speeds and accumulate in \"bunches.\" Each bunch of protons is released from the ring as a pulse, at a rate of 60 times per second (60 hertz). The high-energy proton pulses strike a target of liquid mercury, where spallation occurs. The spalled neutrons are then slowed down in a moderator and guided through beam lines to areas containing special instruments where they are used in a wide variety of experiments.\n\nMost of the world's neutron sources were built decades ago, and although the uses and demand for neutrons have increased throughout the years, few new sources have been built. To fill that need for a new, improved neutron source, the DOE Office of Basic Energy Sciences funded the construction of SNS, which would provide the most intense pulsed neutron beams in the world for scientific research and industrial development.\n\nThe construction of SNS was a partnership of six DOE national laboratories: Argonne, Brookhaven, Lawrence Berkeley, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Jefferson. This collaboration was one of the largest of its kind in U.S. scientific history and was used to bring together the best minds and experience from many different fields.\n\nAfter more than five years of construction and a cost of $1.4 billion, SNS was completed in April 2006. The first three instruments began commissioning and were available to the scientific community in August 2007.\n\nAs of 2017, a total of 20 instruments have been completed, and SNS is hosting about 1,400 researchers per year.\n\n"}

Unlike fiat money, which also has little intrinsic value, it is limited legal tender. It does not have free coinage.\n\nPlato distinguished between tokens and commodities.\n\nIn the early nineteenth century, David Ricardo suggested issuing token money as long as it did not affect commodity standard.\n\nToken money has less commodity value compared to its face value. If the token money is metallic it is commonly made out of cheaper metals such as copper and nickel.\n\nToken money is also money whose face value exceeds its cost of production, i.e. the intrinsic value is lower than the extrinsic value. This means that the actual worth of a note or coin is much less than what we use it for. The cost of production of token money is less than its actual value, for example with convertible currency, collector notes, souvenirs, coupons, some retired US banknotes and per 1986 banknotes printed in regulation size and only on one side with authorization are actually worth more dollars than when issued.\n\nWith token money, exchanges are not considered fully complete because the exchange of value is not equivalent. Value is hoped to be rendered at some future time. Examples of this include bills of exchange or negotiable instrument and certificates.\n\nToken money does not have free coinage.\n\nToken money may be representative money, as well as having nominal value; that is, its owner has a legal claim to a fixed amount of a commodity that has intrinsic value.\n\n"}

It is presented by Huw Edwards Monday to Wednesday, and deputised by Sophie Raworth and Clive Myrie. The programme was controversially moved from 9:00pm on 16 October 2000. The main presenter simultaneously holds the lead presenter role for major events, election night (from 2015) and breaking news for BBC News.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2019, the programme featured a 45-minute format, with a half-hour segment focusing on British national and international news (with an emphasis on the latter), a 12-minute segment featuring local news from the BBC's regions around the country, and concluding with the national weather forecast. The programme used a shortened, 35-minute format on Friday nights to accommodate \"The Graham Norton Show\". In February 2019, in order to accommodate a new time slot focusing on youth programmes from BBC Three, the shortened format was adopted on a nightly basis.\n\nDuring the first three months of its revival, \"ITV News at Ten\" averaged 2.2 million viewers compared with an average of 4.8 million viewers watching the BBC bulletin over the same period.\n\nThe programme was launched on 16 October 2000, replacing the former \"BBC Nine O'Clock News\", which had been on the air since 14 September 1970. Its launch presenters were Michael Buerk and Peter Sissons. The move to 10pm was a response to the controversial axing of rival broadcaster ITV's \"News at Ten\". ITV reinstated a 20-minute news bulletin at 10pm in 22 January 2001, instigating a head-to-head clash with the BBC. The BBC's \"Ten O'Clock News\" eventually became the more popular programme, establishing itself on the BBC One schedule for at least six days a week. ITV's bulletin suffered as a result of poor scheduling, and on 2 February 2004 the bulletin moved to 10:30pm. In 2008, ITV reinstated \"News at Ten\" which remains the BBC's main competitor.\nBuerk and Sissons left the \"BBC Ten O'Clock News\" on 19 January 2003 to make way for presenters Huw Edwards and Fiona Bruce. To mark this presenter reshuffle, on Monday 20 January 2003 as Edwards and Bruce took over, the bulletin and the rest of BBC One news bulletins were relaunched with a new studio.\n\nSince 5 February 2006, the bulletin has been simulcast on the BBC News channel. Following the BBC One bulletin, the remaining portion of the \"BBC Ten O'Clock News Hour\" is followed by Sports News and ‘The Papers’. \n\nOn 21 April 2008 the programme, along with the rest of BBC News, underwent a graphical refresh and moved into a refurbished studio (N6). It also changed its name to \"BBC News at Ten\".\n\nAfter the regional news, there is a weather forecast from the BBC Weather Centre: presenters include Rob McElwee, Peter Gibbs, John Hammond and Philip Avery.\n\n\"BBC News at Ten\" was named News Programme of the Year at the RTS Television Journalism Awards in 2005, 2009 and 2010.\n\nThe programme, along with the BBC News channel and the other BBC One bulletins, moved to Broadcasting House and began broadcasting in high-definition on 18 March 2013.\n\nFollowing a five-month trial during the run-up to the 2015 general election, it was announced that the programme would be permanently extended to 45 minutes on Mondays through Thursdays from January 2016 (with the Friday-night edition retaining its original length to accommodate \"The Graham Norton Show\").\n\nAfter 16 years in the role, in January 2019, Bruce stepped down as the programme's main presenter on Fridays in order to replace David Dimbleby on \"Question Time\". Sophie Raworth and Clive Myrie serve as the regular presenters on Fridays with Bruce occasionally appearing on the programme as a relief presenter.\n\nIn February 2019, it was announced that the programme would be shortened back to 35 minutes beginning 4 March 2019, to accommodate a new broadcast of BBC Three programmes on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday nights. The decision faced criticism from those who believed this was the result of cuts. BBC staff denied that this was the case, arguing that the time slot could help attract BBC Three's target audience, and would also remove the scheduling overlap with \"Newsnight\" on BBC Two.\n\nIn March 2020, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the program was extended to a 45 minute bulletin until further notice.\n\nAs well as presenting from the main studio, the main presenters are called upon to present on location when major stories break. For example, Huw Edwards reported live from Washington for the 2008, 2012 and 2016 US presidential elections and has presented live from Basra at the withdrawal ceremony. He also regularly presented from Westminster, as well as from Edinburgh (at times when the referendum for Scottish independence was being developed).\n\nDuring the 2012 Summer Olympics, presenters also made use of BBC's makeshift studios overlooking the Olympic Park at Stratford. George Alagiah presented from L'Aquila in April 2009, Haiti in 2010, Egypt in 2011, and Tacloban in 2013.\n\nPaul Royall has been the editor of \"BBC News at Ten\" and \"BBC News at Six\" since July 2013. Royall joined the BBC from ITV Meridian in 1997, working on News 24. He later became Deputy Editor of \"BBC Breakfast\" in January 2004, to the Editor Mark Grannell. In May 2009 he became the Deputy Editor of the \"News at Ten\" and \"News at Six\". He became Editor on 22 July 2013, replacing James Stephenson who became Head of BBC World News.\n\nIf there is no position before the years of being a presenter, then this newsreader was either a relief presenter or occasional guest presenter.\n\n\n"}

A grammatical construction (for instance, a phrase or compound) is said to be \"endocentric\" if it fulfils the same linguistic function as one of its parts, and \"exocentric\" if it does not. The distinction reaches back at least to Bloomfield's work of the 1930s. Such a distinction is possible only in phrase structure grammars (constituency grammars), since in dependency grammars all constructions are necessarily endocentric. Further information about the classification of compounds please see Bisetto and Scalise.\n\nAn endocentric construction consists of an obligatory head and one or more dependents, whose presence serves to modify the meaning of the head. For example:\n\nThese phrases are indisputably endocentric. They are endocentric because the one word in each case carries the bulk of the semantic content and determines the grammatical category to which the whole constituent will be assigned. The phrase \"big house\" is a noun phrase in line with its part \"house\", which is a noun. Similarly, \"sing songs\" is a verb phrase in line with its part \"sing\", which is a verb. The same is true of \"very long\"; it is an adjective phrase in line with its part \"long\", which is an adjective. In more formal terms, the distribution of an endocentric construction is functionally equivalent, or approaching equivalence, to one of its parts, which serves as the center, or head, of the whole. An endocentric construction is also known as a \"headed\" construction, where the head is contained \"inside\" the construction.\n\nAn exocentric construction consists of two or more parts, whereby the one or the other of the parts cannot be viewed as providing the bulk of the semantic content of the whole. Further, the syntactic distribution of the whole cannot be viewed as being determined by the one or the other of the parts. The classic instance of an exocentric construction is the sentence (in a phrase structure grammar). The traditional binary division of the sentence (S) into a subject noun phrase (NP) and a predicate verb phrase (VP) was exocentric:\n\nSince the whole is unlike either of its parts, it is exocentric. In other words, since the whole is neither a noun (N) like \"Hannibal\" nor a verb phrase (VP) like \"destroyed Rome\" but rather a sentence (S), it is exocentric. With the advent of X-bar Theory in Transformational Grammar in the 1970s, this traditional exocentric division was largely abandoned and replaced by an endocentric analysis, whereby the sentence is viewed as an inflection phrase (IP), which is essentially a projection of the verb (a fact that makes the sentence a big VP in a sense). Thus with the advent of X-bar Theory, the endocentric vs. exocentric distinction started to become less important in transformational theories of syntax, for without the concept of exocentricity, the notion of endocentricity was becoming vacuous.\n\nBy contrast, in constraint-based syntactic theories, such as Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG), exocentric constructions are still widely used, but with a different role. Exocentricity is used in the treatment of non-configurational languages. As constraint-based models such as LFG do not represent a \"deep structure\" at which non-configurational languages can be treated as configurational, the exocentric S is used to formally represent the flat structure inherent in a non-configurational language. Hence, in a constraints-based analysis of Warlpiri, an exocentric structure follows the auxiliary, dominating all of the verb, arguments and adjuncts which are not raised to the specifier position of the IP:\n\nIn addition, in theories of morphology, the distinction remains, since certain compounds seem to require an exocentric analysis, e.g. \"have-not\" in \"Bill is a have-not\". For a class of compounds described as exocentric, see bahuvrihi.\n\nThe endo- vs. exocentric distinction is possible in phrase structure grammars (= constituency grammars), since they are constituency-based. The distinction is hardly present in dependency grammars, since they are dependency-based. In other words, dependency-based structures are necessarily endocentric, i.e. they are necessarily headed structures. Dependency grammars by definition were much less capable of acknowledging the types of divisions that constituency enables. Acknowledging exocentric structure necessitates that one posit more nodes in the syntactic (or morphological) structure than one has actual words or morphs in the phrase or sentence at hand. What this means is that a significant tradition in the study of syntax and grammar has been incapable from the start of acknowledging the endo- vs. exocentric distinction, a fact that has generated confusion about what should count as an endo- or exocentric structure.\n\nTheories of syntax (and morphology) represent endocentric and exocentric structures using tree diagrams and specific labeling conventions. The distinction is illustrated here using the following trees. The first three trees show the distinction in a constituency-based grammar, and the second two trees show the same structures in a dependency-based grammar:\nThe upper two trees on the left are endocentric since each time, one of the parts, i.e. the head, projects its category status up to the mother node. The upper tree on the right, in contrast, is exocentric, because neither of the parts projects its category status up to the mother node; Z is a category distinct from X or Y. The two dependency trees show the manner in which dependency-based structures are inherently endocentric. Since the number of nodes in the tree structure is necessarily equal to the number of elements (e.g. words) in the string, there is no way to assign the whole (i.e. XY) a category status that is distinct from both X and Y.\n\nTraditional phrase structure trees are mostly endocentric, although the initial binary division of the clause is exocentric (S → NP VP), as mentioned above, e.g.\nThis tree structure contains four divisions, whereby only one of these division is exocentric (the highest one). The other three divisions are endocentric because the mother node has the same basic category status as one of its daughters. The one exocentric division disappears in the corresponding dependency tree:\nDependency positions the finite verb as the root of the entire tree, which means the initial exocentric division is impossible. This tree is entirely endocentric.\n\nThe Chinese language is known for having rich compounds. Linguists often classify compound verbs in Chinese into five types: Subject-Predicate 主謂結構 (SP), Verb-Object 述賓結構 (VO), Verb-Complement 述補結構 (VC), Coordinative 並列結構 (VV), and Endocentric 偏正結構. The Coordinative, Verb-Complement, and Endocentric types are also known as Parallel, Verb-Resultative, and Modifier-Head, respectively.\n\nBelow are a few examples of the exocentric compounds in Chinese.\n\nThe Warlpiri language is widely held as the canonical example of a non-configurational language. As such, Warlpiri sentences exhibit exceptionally flat surface structure. If a non-derivational approach is taken to syntactic structure, this can best be formalised with exocentric S dominated by the auxiliary in I. Thus, an example analysis of the constituent structure of the Warlpiri sentence:\n\nwould be as follows:\n\nWhere S is a non-projected exocentric structure which dominates both heads and phrases with equal weight. The elements in spec of IP and under S can be freely moved and switch places, as position in c-structure, except for I, plays a pragmatic rather than syntactic role in a constraints-based analysis of Warlpiri sentence structure.\n\nWhile exocentric structures have largely disappeared from most theoretical analyses of standard sentence structure, many theories of syntax still assume (something like) exocentric divisions for coordinate structures, e.g.\n\nThe brackets each time mark the conjuncts of a coordinate structure, whereby this coordinate structure includes the material appearing between the left-most bracket and the right-most bracket; the coordinator is positioned between the conjuncts. Coordinate structures like these do not lend themselves to an endocentric analysis in any clear way, nor to an exocentric analysis. One might argue that the coordinator is the head of the coordinate structure, which would make it endocentric. This argument would have to ignore the numerous occurrences of coordinate structures that lack a coordinator (asyndeton), however. One might therefore argue instead that coordinate structures like these are multi-headed, each conjunct being or containing a head. The difficulty with this argument, however, is that the traditional endocentric vs. exocentric distinction did not foresee the existence of multi-headed structures, which means that it did not provide a guideline for deciding whether a multi-headed structure should be viewed as endo- or exocentric. Coordinate structures thus remain a problem area for the endo- vs. exocentric distinction in general.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2073268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073268", "title": "FC Carl Zeiss Jena", "text": "FC Carl Zeiss Jena\n\nFC Carl Zeiss Jena is a German football club based in Jena, Thuringia. Formed in 1903 and initially associated with the Carl Zeiss AG factory, they were one of the strongest clubs in East Germany from the 1960s to the 1980s, winning the DDR-Oberliga and the FDGB-Pokal three times each and reaching the 1981 European Cup Winners' Cup Final. Since German reunification in 1990, the club have competed no higher than the second tier. In the 2019–20 season, Jena are playing in the 3. Liga after winning promotion from the Regionalliga Nordost in 2017.\n\nThe club was founded in May 1903 by workers at the Carl Zeiss AG optics factory as the company-sponsored \"Fussball-Club der Firma Carl Zeiss\". The club underwent name changes in 1911 to \"Fussball Club Carl Zeiss Jena e.V.\" and in March 1917 to \"1. Sportverein Jena e.V.\"\n\nIn 1933, \"1. SV Jena\" joined the Gauliga Mitte, one of 16 top-flight divisions formed in the reorganization of German football under the Third Reich. The team captured division titles in 1935, 1936, 1940, and 1941. This earned \"Jena\" entry to the national finals, but they performed poorly and were never able to advance out of preliminary-round group play. After the 1943–44 season, the Gauliga Mitte broke up into a collection of city-based leagues as World War II overtook the area.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the war, associations of all types (including sports and football clubs) were banned in Germany by the occupying Allied authorities. Jena was reconstituted in June 1946 as \"SG Ernst Abbe Jena\" and, like many other clubs in East Germany, underwent a number of name changes: \"SG Stadion Jena\" (October 1948), \"SG Carl Zeiss Jena\" (March 1949), \"BSG Mechanik Jena\" (January 1951), \"BSG Motor Jena\" (May 1951) and \"SC Motor Jena\" (November 1954).\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, East German authorities tagged sports teams with the names of socialist heroes: Ernst Abbe was a local son and physicist associated with the Zeiss optical factory. He made an early contribution to easing the plight of workers by introducing the 8-hour work day at the Zeiss plant, a milestone for labour during the late 19th century.\n\nIn 1950 the club became a founding member of the DDR Liga (II), and in their second season captured a divisional title to win promotion to the top-flight DDR Oberliga for a single-season appearance. Renamed \"SC Motor Jena\" in 1954, they played their way back to the upper league by 1957. \"Jena\" won its first honours with the capture of the FDGB-Pokal in 1960 and followed up with the East German national title in 1963. The club was \"re-founded\" as \"FC Carl Zeiss Jena\" in January 1966, and became one of East Germany's \"focus centres\" for the development of players for the national side and a dominant side in the DDR-Oberliga. They took two more national titles in 1968 and 1970, but finished in second place another half-dozen times to sides such as Vorwärts Berlin, Dynamo Dresden and 1. FC Magdeburg. They also captured East German Cups in 1972, 1974 and 1980, and appeared in the 1981 European Cup Winners' Cup final, losing 2–1 to Dinamo Tbilisi.\n\nAfter German reunification in 1990, Jena entered the 2. Bundesliga. Their second-place finish in 1992 deteriorated into a 17th-place finish in 1994 and relegation to Regionalliga Nordost (III). They won immediate promotion, and played for three more years at tier-II level. Since 1999 the team has primarily played tier III and IV football, but a second place-finish in the Regionalliga Nord secured Jena promotion to the 2. Bundesliga for the 2006–07 season. Jena remained in the 2. Bundesliga by winning 2–1 away against FC Augsburg in their final match of the season. They finished last in the 2. Bundesliga in 2007–08, returning to the third tier. However, this would not be one of the Regionalligen; the German Football Association (DFB) launched the new 3. Liga for 2008–09, of which Jena was a charter member.\n\nOn 9 November 2009 chairman Peter Schreiber announced his retirement; on 13 November the executive board accepted his resignation, and on 25 November Hartmut Bayer became the new chairman. The second team was involved in the 2009 European football betting scandal, accused of match-fixing in the game against ZFC Meuselwitz. On 10 December 2009 the club announced that it was in financial distress, owing over €1 million. In January 2010 the players agreed to accept a lower salary.\n\nCarl Zeiss Jena have a friendship with the Welsh side Newport County, after the two sides played against each other in the European Cup Winners' Cup in the early 1980s. As with Carl Zeiss Jena, Newport County have seen similar struggles off and on the pitch, and the teams regularly play each other during pre-season.\n\nCarl Zeiss Jena were relegated from the 3. Liga in 2012 and finished second in the tier four Regionalliga Nordost in 2013, and third in 2014. In the 2016–17 season they won the Regionalliga Nordost and were promoted to 3. Liga after a play-off win against Viktoria Köln. CZ Jena won the first match in Köln 3–2 and lost the second leg 1–0 at home, but were promoted on the away goals rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFCC sent 33 players to the DDR (East German) national side.\n\nBefore the end of World War II, Jena sent three players to the German national side: Willy Krauß (1911–12), Heinz Werner (1935) and Ludwig Gärtner (1939–41).\n\nAmerican defender, Brian Bliss, played at the club from 1992 to 1996 and received regular calls to the United States men's national soccer team. He went on to play for MLS side Columbus Crew SC and would later serve as technical director in the club's front office.\n\nAnother notable player is former Germany goalkeeper Robert Enke, who started his career at the club and then went on to play for clubs such as Hannover 96, FC Barcelona and S.L. Benfica.\n\n\n\nThe recent season-by-season performance of the club:\n\n\n\nThe club's reserve team, FC Carl Zeiss Jena II, currently plays in the tier five NOFV-Oberliga Süd. It first played at this level from 1994 to 1999, and again since 2006 with a third place in 1996 and 2010 as its best results.\n\nThe team also won the Thuringia Cup in 1993. The latter allowed the club qualification to the 1993–94 DFB-Pokal where it lost 2–0 to Bayern Munich.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2073273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073273", "title": "The House on the Cliff", "text": "The House on the Cliff\n\nThe House On The Cliff is the second book in the original The Hardy Boys Mystery Stories published by Grosset & Dunlap. The book ranks 72nd on the \"Publishers Weekly's\" All-Time Bestselling Children's Book List in the United States with 1,712,433 copies sold . This book is one of the \"Original 10\" \"Hardy Boys\" books and is an excellent example of the writing style used by the Stratemeyer Syndicate's writers. This style influenced many other \"youth adventure series\" books that the Stratemeyer Syndicate also published, including the Nancy Drew series (designed as a corollary to \"The Hardy Boys\" written from the perspective of young girls), the Tom Swift adventure series, the Bobbsey Twins and other lesser known series. All of them used a unique writing style that made them very recognizable as Stratemeyer product.\n\nThis book was written for the Stratemeyer Syndicate by Leslie McFarlane in 1927. Between 1959 and 1973 the first 38 volumes of this series were systematically revised as part of a project directed by Harriet Adams, Edward Stratemeyer's daughter. The original version of this book was rewritten in 1959 by Harriet S. Adams resulting in two different stories with the same title.\n\nFenton Hardy, the famous private detective and father of the Hardy Boys, asks his sons to help him with his latest case involving a criminal named Felix Snattman and the illegal drug trade smuggling of stolen drugs. Hardy directs Frank and Joe to a house on the cliff, whose location overlooking Barmet Bay offers an excellent vantage point to watch for smugglers. \n\nThe Hardys are tricked into the house by cries for help, and are trapped for a short time in the attic; meanwhile, their telescope and motorcycles are damaged, possibly by the smugglers. They observe a man boating on Barmet Bay being chased by another motorboat. After his boat explodes in flames, Biff and Joe swim out while Frank and Chet get a rowboat to rescue the man. Once brought to shore, the man regains consciousness and says his name is Mr. Jones, which the Hardys believe to be a thinly-disguised alias. \n\nThe next day, both Mr. Hardy and Mr. Jones disappear. Frank and Joe seek out Mr. Hardy's informant at the maritime docks, Pretzel Pete, to see if he knows anything about the smugglers. Frank and Joe revisit the Shore Road area, and inside the house not far from the house on the cliff, Frank sees Mr. Hardy's hat. With their friends Chet Morton, Biff Hooper and Tony Prito, they use a boat to search for a secret tunnel at the base of the cliff. Frank and Joe try to rescue Mr. Hardy but they are also captured at gunpoint. Chet and Tony go to the United States Coast Guard and find Biff Hooper, Jerry Gilroy, and Phil Cohen there and lead them to the smuggler's secret cave. \n\nIt turns out that Mr. Jones was a spy working for the Coast Guard. At the end the Hardys escape into the house on the cliff and capture Snattman while he is negotiating with police. Snattman apologizes and describes his life as difficult. As an infant, he lost his father, and he inherited the house from his dead uncle. His uncle was mean to him, and he never really had the opportunity to be properly trained. As a result, he wanted to turn the house into a Boys' Home, one where boys who are not properly trained can come to live.\n\nThe front cover of the revised edition shows three boys in a boat, but in the text four boys are described being in the boat. The boys include Joe Hardy, Frank Hardy, Chet Morton and Biff Hooper.\n\nIn 2002 St. Martin's Minotaur published \"The House On The Point\", an homage to \"The House on the Cliff\" by Benjamin Hoff. Hoff wrote this book as a tribute to Franklin W. Dixon and The Hardy Boys, who had provided him with much entertainment during his youth. He did this by taking the original 1927 edition and stripping out all the details to form an outline of the story similar to, in his opinion, the outline Leslie McFarlane would have received from the Stratemeyer Syndicate. He then reimagined the story using his own version of the familiar Hardy Boys characters, making many minor changes, such as the case which Fenton Hardy is investigating, and more significant changes to the characters and their personalities. For example, in this reimagined version Callie Shaw and Iola Morten play an active role in investigating the Polucca residence and Callie shows her concern for Frank by giving him a kiss on the lips. Note that this would not likely have been permitted in the original, for (as McFarlane writes in \"Ghost of the Hardy Boys\" ) Stratemeyer expected the girls to make only occasional appearances and to have relationships with the boys that \"would not go beyond the borders of wholesome friendship and discreet mutual esteem.\"\n"}
{"id": "2073281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073281", "title": "Anthracycline", "text": "Anthracycline\n\nAnthracyclines is a class of drugs used in cancer chemotherapy that are extracted from \"Streptomyces\" bacterium. These compounds are used to treat many cancers, including leukemias, lymphomas, breast, stomach, uterine, ovarian, bladder cancer, and lung cancers. The first anthracycline discovered was daunorubicin (trade name Daunomycin), which is produced naturally by \"Streptomyces peucetius\", a species of actinobacteria. Clinically the most important anthracyclines are doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin and idarubicin.\n\nThe anthracyclines are among the most effective anticancer treatments ever developed and are effective against more types of cancer than any other class of chemotherapeutic agents. Their main adverse effect is cardiotoxicity, which considerably limits their usefulness. Use of anthracyclines has also been shown to be significantly associated with cycle 1 severe or febrile neutropenia. Other adverse effects include vomiting.\n\nThe drugs act mainly by intercalating with DNA and interfering with DNA metabolism and RNA production. Cytotoxicity is primarily due to inhibition of topoisomerase II after the enzyme induces a break in DNA, preventing religation of the break and leading to cell death. The basic structure of anthracyclines is that of a tetracyclic molecule with an anthraquinone backbone connected to a sugar moiety by a glycosidic linkage. When taken up by a cell the four ring structure intercalates between DNA bases pairs while the sugar sits within the minor groove and interacts with adjacent base pairs.\n\nDaunorubicin is a red pigmented drug which was discovered in the early 1960s. It was isolated from a strain of \"Streptomyces peucetius\" by Di Marco and coworkers, working for Farmitalia Research Laboratories in Italy who called it daunomycin. About the same time Dubost and coworkers in France also discovered the compound and named it rubidomycin. Daunorubicin was adopted as the international name. Initially it was seen to have activity against murine tumours and then in clinical trials it was found to be active against leukaemia and lymphomas.\n\nDoxorubicin was isolated from a mutated variant of S. \"peucetius\" (var. \"caesius\"). It differs from daunorubicin only by the addition of a hydroxyl group at the carbon 14 position. This modification greatly changes the activity of the drug making it highly effective against a wide range of solid tumours, leukaemia and lymphomas. It is the standard by which novel anthracyclines are judged.\n\nThe first anthracyclines were so successful that thousands of analogues have been produced in attempts to find compounds with improved therapeutic applications. Only epirubicin and idarubicin have been adopted for worldwide use. Epirubicin has similar activity to doxorubicin, however has reduced cardiotoxic side effects. Idarubicin is a fat soluble variant of daunorubicin and is orally bioavailable.\n\nSeveral groups of researchers focused on designing compounds that retained the polycyclic aromatic chromophore of the anthracyclines (favouring intercalation into DNA) and substituting the sugar residue with simple side chains. This led to the identification of the mitoxantrone which is classed as an anthracenedione compound and is used in the clinic for the management of various cancers. Disaccharide analogues have been shown to retain anticancer activity, and are being further investigated with respect to their mechanism of action.\n\nAlthough it has been 50 years from the discovery of anthracyclines, and despite recent advances in the development of targeted therapies for cancers, around 32% of breast cancer patients, 57%-70% of elderly lymphoma patients and 50–60% of childhood cancer patients are treated with anthracyclines. Some cancers benefit from neoadjuvant anthracycline-based regimes, and these include triple negative breast cancers that do not respond well to targeted therapies due to the lack of available receptors that can be targeted. Compared to non-triple negative breast cancer patients, triple negative breast cancer patients have shown better response rate and higher pathological response rate with anthracycline use, an indicator used for predicting improved long-term outcomes.\n\nAnthracyclines remain some of the most widely used chemotherapeutic agents but their potential is limited by its dose-limiting toxicities. Currently, there are many studies being conducted in the search for anthracyclines with better anti-tumour efficacy or with reduced side effects using different nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems.\n\nThe anthracyclines have been widely studied for their interactions with cellular components and impact on cellular processes. This includes studies in cultured cells and in whole animal systems. A myriad of drug-cellular interactions have been documented in the scientific literature and these vary with respect to the properties of target cells, drug dose and drug intermediates produced. Since artefactual mechanisms of action can be observed, the following mechanisms which occur at clinically relevant drug concentrations are the most important.\n\nAnthracyclines are readily taken up by cells and localised to the nucleus. The chromophore moiety of anthracyclines has intercalating function and inserts in between the adjacent base pair of DNA. The intercalating function inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis in highly replicating cells, subsequently blocking the transcription and replication processes.\n\nThis is by far the most-accepted mechanism to explain the action of anthracyclines as topoisomerase-II mediated toxicity is evident at clinically relevant drug concentrations. Topoisomerase-II is an enzyme that creates temporary double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks and reseals them after managing torsion of DNA supercoils. Anthracyclines intercalated into DNA, form a stable anthracycline-DNA-topoisomerase II ternary complex thus \"poisoning\" the enzyme and impeding the religation of double-stranded DNA breaks. This topoisomerase-II-mediated DNA damage subsequently promotes growth arrest and recruits DNA repair machinery. When the repair process fails, the lesions initiate programmed cell death.\n\nThe quinone moiety of anthracyclines can undergo redox reactions to generate excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of oxidoreductive enzymes such as cytochrome P450 reductase, NADH dehydrogenase and xanthine oxidase. Converting quinone to semiquinone produces free radicals that actively react with oxygen to generate superoxides, hydroxyl radicals and peroxides. In addition, the availability of cellular iron catalyses redox reactions and further generates ROS. The excessive ROS that cannot be detoxified results in oxidative stress, DNA damage, and lipid peroxidation thereby triggering apoptosis.\n\nAnthracyclines can also form adducts with DNA by a single covalent bond through an aminal linkage from the 3’-amino of daunosamine to the exocyclic amino of guanine. The supply of extracellular formaldehyde using formaldehyde-releasing prodrugs can promote covalent DNA adduct formation. Such adducts have been shown to block GpC specific transcription factors and induce apoptotic responses.\n\nResults from a recent meta-analysis provide evidence that breast cancer patients with either duplication of centromere 17 or aberrations in \"TOP2A\", the gene coding for topoisomerase-IIα, benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy that incorporates anthracyclines. This does not include subgroups of patients that harbour amplification of HER2. The observations from this study also allow patients to be identified where anthracyclines might be safely omitted from treatment strategies.\n\nAnthracycline administration is often accompanied by adverse drug reactions that limit the use of anthracyclines in the clinics. Two major dose limiting toxicities of anthracyclines include myelosuppression and cardiotoxicity. Fortunately, the introduction of therapeutic cytokines allows management of myelosuppression. Hence, cardiac injury remains as the major drawback of anthracycline-based anti-cancer agents.\n\nAnthracycline-mediated cardiotoxicity is dose-dependent and cumulative, with the damage imposed to heart occurring upon the very first dose and then accumulating with each anthracycline cycle. There are four types of anthracycline-associated cardiotoxicity that have been described.\n\nIn the clinic, a maximum recommended cumulative dose is set for anthracyclines to prevent the development of congestive heart failure. As an example, the incidence of congestive heart failure is 4.7%, 26% and 48% respectively when patients received doxorubicin at 400 mg/m, 550 mg/m and 700 mg/m. Therefore, the lifetime cumulative doxorubicin exposure is limited to 400–450 mg/m in order to reduce congestive heart failure incidence to less than 5%, although variation in terms of tolerance to doxorubicin exists between individuals. The risk factors that influence the extent of cardiac injury caused by anthracyclines include genetic variability, age (low or high age groups), previous treatments with cardiotoxic drugs and history of cardiac diseases. Children are particularly at risk due to the anthracycline activity that can compromise the development of the immature heart.\n\nCardiac injury that occurs in response to initial doses of anthracycline can be detected by a rise in troponin level immediately after administration. Biopsy also allows early detection of cardiac injury by evaluating heart ultrastructure changes. Receiving cumulative doses of anthracycline causes left ventricle dysfunction and with continued dosage reaches a certain threshold that can be clinically detected by non-invasive techniques such as 2D echocardiography and strain rate imaging. Advances in developing more sensitive imaging techniques and biomarkers allow early detection of cardiotoxicity and allow cardioprotective intervention to prevent anthracycline-mediated cardiotoxicity.\n\nThe predominant susceptibility of the heart to anthracyclines is due in part to a preferential mitochondrial localisation of anthracyclines. This is attributed to high affinity interaction between anthracyclines and cardiolipin, a phospholipid present in the heart mitochondrial membrane, as heart tissue contains a relatively high number of mitochondria per cell. Heart tissue also has an impaired defence against oxidative stress, displaying a low level of anti-oxidant enzymes such as catalase and superoxide dismutase for detoxifying anthracycline-mediated ROS.\n\nThe mechanisms accounting for anthracycline-induced cardiac damage are complex and interrelated. It was first recognised to be related to the oxidative stress induced by anthracyclines. A more recent explanation has emerged, in which anthracycline-mediated cardiotoxicity is due to anthracycline-topoisomerase IIb poisoning, leading to downstream oxidative stress.\n\nIn order to reduce the impact of cardiac injury in response to anthracyclines, a few cardioprotective strategies have been explored. Liposomal formulations of anthracyclines (discussed below) have been developed and used to reduce cardiac damage. Other novel anthracycline analogues such as epirubicin and idarubicin also provide options to reduce adverse cardiac events; these analogues have failed to show superior anti-cancer activity to the parent compounds. An alternative drug administration method involving continuous infusion for 72 h as compared to bolus administration provides some protection and can be used when high cumulative doses are anticipated.\n\nWhen anthracyclines are given intravenously, it may result in accidental extravasation at injection sites. It is estimated that the extravasation incidence ranges from 0.1% to 6%. Extravasation causes serious complications to surrounding tissues with the symptoms of tissue necrosis and skin ulceration. Dexrazoxane is primarily used to treat anthracyclines post-extravasation by acting as a topoisomerase II inhibitor as well as a chelating agent to reduce oxidative stress caused by anthracyclines. Dexrazoxane has also been used with success as a cardioprotective compound in combination with doxorubicin in metastatic breast cancer patients who have been treated with more than 300 mg/m doxorubicin, as well as in patients who are anticipated to have a beneficial effect from high cumulative doses of doxorubicin.\n\nThere is no high quality evidence to confirm if cardioprotective treatments are effective . Studies of the cardioprotective nature of dexrazoxane, provide evidence that it can prevent heart damage without interfering with the anti‐tumour effects of anthracycline treatment. Patients given dexrazoxane with their anthracycline treatment had their risk of heart failure reduced compared to those treated with anthracyclines without dexrazoxane. There was no effect on survival though. \n\nRadiolabelled doxorubicin has been utilised as a breast cancer lesion imaging agent in a pilot study. This radiochemical, Tc-doxorubicin, localised to mammary tumour lesions in female patients, and is a potential radiopharmaceutical for imaging of breast tumours.\n\nIn some cases, anthracyclines may be ineffective due to the development of drug resistance. It can either be primary resistance (insensitive response to initial therapy) or acquired resistance (present after demonstrating complete or partial response to treatment). Resistance to anthracyclines involves many factors, but it is often related to overexpression of the transmembrane drug efflux protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1), which removes anthracyclines from cancer cells. A large research effort has been focused in designing inhibitors against MRP1 to re-sensitise anthracycline resistant cells, but many such drugs have failed during clinical trials.\n\nLiposomes are spherical shape, phospholipid vesicles that can be formed with one or more lipid bilayers with phospholipids or cholesterols. The ability of liposomes to encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drug compounds allowed liposomes to be an efficient drug delivery systems (DDS) to deliver a range of drugs in these nano-carriers.\n\nLiposomal formulations of anthracyclines have been developed to maintain or even enhance the therapeutic efficacy of anthracyclines while reduce its limiting toxicities to healthy tissues, particularly cardiotoxicity. Currently, there are two liposomal formulations of doxorubicin available in the clinics.\n\nDoxil/Caelyx is the first FDA approved liposomal DDS, and was initially used to treat AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma in 1995 and is now being used for treating recurrent ovarian cancer, metastatic breast cancer with increased cardiac risk, and multiple myeloma. Doxorubicin is encapsulated in a nano-carrier known as Stealth or sterically stabilised liposomes, consisting of unilamellar liposomes coated with hydrophilic polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG) that is covalently linked to liposome phospholipids. The PEG coating serves as a barrier from opsonisation, rapid clearance while the drug is stably retained inside the nano-carriers via an ammonium sulphate chemical gradient. A major advantage of using nano-carriers as a drug delivery system is the ability of the nano-carriers to utilise the leaky vasculature of tumours and their impaired lymphatic drainage via the EPR effect.\n\nThe maximum plasma concentration of free doxorubicin after Doxil administration is substantially lower compared to conventional doxorubicin, providing an explanation for its low cardiotoxicity profile. However, Doxil can cause Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE, hand and foot syndrome) due to its accumulation in the skin. Doxil has lower maximum tolerable dose (MTD) at 50 mg/m every 4 weeks compared to free doxorubicin at 60 mg/m every 3 weeks. Despite this, the maximum cumulative dose for Doxil is still higher compared to doxorubicin due to its cardioprotective characteristics.\n\nMyocet is another non-pegylated liposome encapsulated doxorubicin citrate complex approved for use in combination with cyclophosphamide in metastatic breast cancer patients as first line treatment in Europe and Canada. Doxorubicin is loaded into the liposomes just before administration to patients with a maximum single dose of 75 mg/m every 3 weeks. Myocet has similar efficacy as conventional doxorubicin, while significantly reducing cardiac toxicity.\nDrug interactions with anthracyclines can be complex and might be due to the effect, side effects, or metabolism of the anthracycline. Drugs which inhibit Cytochrome P450 or other oxidases may reduce clearance of anthracyclines, prolonging their circulating half-life which can increase cardiotoxicity and other side effects. As they act as antibiotics anthracyclines can reduce the effectiveness of live culture treatments such as Bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy for bladder cancer. As they act as myelosuppressors anthracyclines can reduce the effectiveness of vaccines by inhibiting the immune system.\n\nSeveral interactions are of particular clinical importance. Though dexrazoxane can be used to mitigate cardiotoxicity or extravasation damage of anthracyclines it also may reduce their effectiveness and the recommendation is not to start dexrazoxane treatment upon initial anthracycline treatment. Trastuzumab (a HER2 antibody used to treat breast cancer) may enhance the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines although the interaction can be minimised by implementing a time interval between anthracycline and trastuzumab administration. Taxanes (except docetaxel) may decrease anthracycline metabolism, increasing serum concentrations of anthracyclines. The recommendation is to treat with anthracyclines first if combination treatment with taxanes is required.\n\n"}

The original version of this book was rewritten in 1962 by Alistair Hunter resulting in two different stories with the same title.\n\nThe Hardy boys learn a case of counterfeit insecurities of Australians across the European border is somehow intertwined with a national security case their dad is working on.\n\nFrank and Joe help prevent 14-year-old cyclist Ken Blake from getting killed in an accident. As they help the boy up they see he is delivering an envelope to Victor Peters, a name that means something to the Hardys later on in the book.\n\nThe Hardys learn that their friend Chet Morton has been tricked when asked to make change for what turned out to be a counterfeit twenty dollar bill, something that the police later confirm is becoming more common in their town of Bayport.\n\nLater, Joe is awakened by a clattering sound and sees a mysterious figure bicycling away from the Hardys' home. While investigating the disturbance a note is found that reads, \"Drop case or else danger for you and your family.\" The Hardy boys are not sure if this threat refers to the counterfeiting case that Frank and Joe are investigating or another case their detective dad, Fenton Hardy, is trying to solve.\n\nThe Hardys go with Chet, who wants to apply for a job at Elekton Controls, a missile-development company, but are told by Mr. Markel, one of Elekton's security guards, that there are no openings. Before leaving, they notice a bike that looks similar to the one ridden by Ken Blake and that is likely to have been used by the person who left the threatening note. Mr. Docker, an Elekton maintenance man, tells them that Ken does odd jobs for the company, but that he is not there at that time, even though Joe is certain he saw Ken looking out an adjacent old watermill's window at them. The Hardys, their girlfriends, Iola Morton and Callie Shaw and Chet go nearby to have a picnic but an arrow is shot at them with an attached note reading, \"Danger. Hardys beware.\"\n\nThe Hardy brothers receive a gift of a motorboat they call \"The Sleuth\", and show it to their friend, Tony Prito. Tony says the construction supply yard he is working at for the summer has become the latest to receive counterfeit money used to pay for lumber by a boy matching the description of Ken Blake. The Hardys take \"The Sleuth\" to the mill to investigate and find the mill wheel starting and stopping. Soon, they are attacked and left without gas in their new boat. They recover and get back to investigating by finding Ken who says he thinks someone has used his bike the same night that Joe saw someone bicycling from the Hardy's home. Markel and Docker pull Ken away and then a suspicious vehicle leaves Elekton. Later, the same suspicious vehicle gets away before an explosion at Elekton. Frank and Joe are terrified that their dad is inside the burning building. He was in the building but survived the explosion revealing that he was there to stop the attack after realizing there is a pattern to similar type attacks going on around similar companies in the United States.\n\nEager to learn more from Ken, the Hardys soon find that Ken has been released from Elekton. The Hardys find him at a boarding house and he explains that the bricks and lumber bought with the counterfeit money were being used for a project at the mill. Frank and Joe return to the old mill and realize that the wheel mill is set up to act as a signaling device for the people living inside; an electric-eye stops the flow of electricity to the wheel. It acts as a warning to those inside that someone is approaching the mill. Going inside the mill at a time when they know no one else is there, they discover a secret room hidden by the lumber bought with counterfeit money. In the secret room, they find the tools used to make the fake money, but before they can get away the villains return to the mill. Frank and Joe escape through a tunnel but are captured by Docker and Markel.\n\nVictor Peters arrives and these three villains reveal that Docker shot the arrow at the girlfriends and Markel used the bike to deliver the note to the Hardys' home. Docker and Markel also explain that, without the knowledge of Victor Peters, they allowed another villain, Paul Blum, into Elekton to attack the place, which is the case that Fenton Hardy was investigating. Blum reveals that he is working for other countries who wish to stop United States missile development. Frank and Joe take advantage of an opportunity and overtake the villains. The book ends with the police arresting all the villains and the expectation of the Hardys' next case when \"they were called upon to solve the mystery of \"The Missing Chums\".\"\n"}

This book is one of the \"Original 10\", generally considered to be the best examples of the Hardy Boys, and Stratemeyer Syndicate, writing.\n\nThe plot concerns the disappearance of the Boys' chums, Chet and Biff, when they take a motorboat trip down the coast. When Frank and Joe finally find them, they are all captured. In the end, they triumph over the bad guys on mysterious Blacksnake Island.\n\nThis book was written for the Stratemeyer Syndicate by Leslie McFarlane in 1928. Between 1959 and 1973 the first 38 volumes of this series were systematically revised as part of a project directed by Harriet Adams, Edward Stratemeyer's daughter. The original version of this book was rewritten in 1962 by James Buechler resulting in two different stories with the same title.\n\nThe original version of this title is noted for being the first Hardy Boys book in which Aunt Gertrude makes an appearance.\n\nAt the beginning of the book the boys take their new boat, the \"Sleuth\", out on the bay. While they are cruising on the bay another boat nearly rams them. They are unable to give chase because of a damaged steering mechanism on boat, and the boys end up going around in circles. It turns out that the boat that nearly rammed them had a purpose for doing so, but the reason why is not revealed until the end of the book.\n\nSoon after, the boys prepare to go to Callie Shaw's costume party. They inadvertently stumble upon another part of the unraveling mystery as they see some unknown men in Mr. French's Costume Shop, who appear to threaten him.\n\nReturning home, the boys frighten their Aunt Gertrude with their costumes. (Aunt Gertrude is a recurring character in the series.) Soon the boys are off to the costume party on their motorcycles. On the way they realize that the bank is being robbed. They follow the criminals until they lose them at the docks, where they hop into a boat and escape into the fog.\n\nAfter notifying the United States Coast Guard, the boys gain permission from Chief Collig to search for the criminals in the \"Sleuth\", but the boys discover the \"Sleuth\" has been stolen. The boys search for the bank robbers in Tony Prito's boat, the \"Napoli\", but are unable to find them in the thickening fog. The boys return home, explain to their father everything they saw at the bank and during the chase, and then head out to the costume party.\n\nThe next day the boys awaken to learn that Chet Morton and Biff Hooper never made it home from the party. The boys not only have to learn who stole the Sleuth, but where their missing friends went, and who robbed the bank. As the story develops the boys learn that expensive radios that may have been stolen are turning up. Lastly, a hermit on a tiny island with a shotgun threatens the boys. Soon they rescue their friends and escape. The book ends saying that Frank and Joe would soon start a new case \"in the near future while \"Hunting for Hidden Gold.\"'\n\nThe original story opens with Chet Morton and Biff Hooper preparing for a week-long boating trip in Biff's new motorboat \"Envoy\". As Frank and Joe are instructing Biff on the handling of the craft in Barmet Bay, another boat occupied by three men menaces them, nearly causing \"Envoy\" to collide with two sailboats. The Hardy Boys note that the three men were closely watching Chet and Biff, which becomes important later in the story.\n\nThe next day, an excited Chet and Biff leave for their boating trip on the \"Envoy.\" Both friend Tony Prito in his boat \"Napoli\" and Frank and Joe in their \"Sleuth\" decide to escort their friends to the end of the bay to see them off on their journey. Frank and Joe take Callie Shaw and Iola Morton as passengers. But before any of them reach the ocean, a violent squall strikes the bay and the \"Sleuth\" is forced to turn back to port, nearly capsizing. Soon after, \"Napoli\" also returns and Tony reports that \"Envoy\" did not turn back, and that Biff and Chet decided to press on through the storm. The boat was last seen headed out to the open ocean.\n\nAfter three days with no word from their friends, Frank and Joe organize a search effort to find trace of them. Before they can begin, however, their plans are interrupted by the arrival of their Aunt Gertrude, who has come for an extended visit, and doesn't approve of \"letting children go out in boats.\" With the approval of Mrs. Hardy, they eventually begin searching up the coast, accompanied again by Tony Prito in his \"Napoli.\" No villages up the coast have seen any sign of Biff's boat, though the boys do find some anonymous wreckage on a reef which leads them to believe that disaster struck the \"Envoy.\" They return home in defeat, and Chet and Biff are presumed dead by the community.\n\nSeveral days later, however, their hopes are restored when Aunt Gertrude opens a letter addressed to her brother Fenton Hardy. It is from Baldy Turk's gang, who claim to have kidnapped Frank and Joe, and are demanding ransom for their return. Frank and Joe, obviously not kidnapped, deduce that gangsters must be holding Chet and Biff, mistakenly believing that they are the Hardy Brothers. At this time, Tony also remembers that Biff once mentioned going \"down\" the coast, to Blacksnake Island. \nAfter one misadventure where Frank and Joe believe they have spotted Chet on a schooner, the boys approach Blacksnake Island to see the same boat which had menaced them on the bay leaving it. They land on the island and search for signs of Chet and Biff, eventually finding them being held captive in a cave by Baldy Turk's gang.\n\nAfter briefly freeing their friends, all the boys are recaptured, and hear news that Fenton Hardy has also been taken by the gang. They escape again, but Frank and Joe get separated from their friends once more in the darkness. They reach their boat, and steal the gang's boats as well, leaving the criminals stranded on the island with Chet and Biff.\n\nThe Hardys return with the authorities and round up the gang, finally releasing their friends from captivity. They return home to find that their father is also safe, and had arrested Baldy Turk while Frank and Joe had helped capture the rest of his gang.\n\nThe cover of the revised edition shows Frank and Joe spotting Chet and Biff in a distant boat as lightning strikes down. This scene takes place on page 139 of the revised edition. The image is sometimes confused with a similar scene in the original edition.\n"}

ZEI has participated in research, policy advice, and dialogue between science and practice since its establishment in 1995. ZEI also offers graduate education and mid-career training opportunities to contribute to the resolution of unresolved issues of European integration and the shaping of Europe's global role. ZEI directors are Prof. Dr. Ludger Kühnhardt and Prof. Dr. Christian Koenig.\n\nThe Berlin-Bonn Act of May 29, 1994–dealing with the consequence of the move of Germany’s national political institutions from Bonn to Berlin - provided for the establishment of a \"Center for European Integration Studies” (ZEI) and a \"Center for Development Research” (ZEF) as central scientific institutions of the University of Bonn. On May 4, 1995 the Senate of the University of Bonn agreed to establish these two centers. The overall concept was formulated in consultation with the participating organs of the federal government and the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. It is based on an original proposal of the Senate of the University of Bonn from February 11, 1993. The Senate decision of May 4, 1995 is considered the founding date of the \"Center for European Integration Studies\" (ZEI) and the \"Center for Development Research.\" (ZEF)\n\nAccording to the founding resolution of the Senate of the University of Bonn of May 4, 1995, the tasks of ZEI are as follows: \"ZEI will function as a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary institution aimed working on problems in the areas of political, legal, economic, social and cultural integration disparities in a regional and pan-European context. ZEI will conduct basic research in the conceptual area that encourages integration of research and to coordinate these efforts within the University and externally. ZEI is to take part in the solutions of concrete problems of integration by offering practical advice. All in all ZEI sees itself as a platform for the discussion of policy issues, a place to develop concepts, hypotheses and models. As an interface between theory and practice, ZEI focuses on institutional- and capacity-building in the field of integration research in Europe. ZEI can only realize its aforementioned goals through consistent openness to the public, through inclusion of guest researchers and through close cooperation with non-university institutions to integrate research, practice and integration of the European Union.”\n\nThe Center for European Integration Studies (ZEI) provides future oriented research on unresolved issues of European integration and the global role of Europe. ZEI’s research and teaching emphasis on “Governance and Regulation in the EU” brings together two aspects whose critical interplay shapes the EU, its impact on citizens’ lives and its role globally. The work of ZEI - basically in the fields of political science and law - is applied and linked with innovative knowledge transfer. The dynamic interplay between governance and regulation in the EU serves as the touch stone for research, teaching and consulting work conducted at ZEI.\n\nZEI offers postgraduate students an English-speaking Master in European Studies - Governance and Regulation. An international faculty from across Europe guarantees highest scholarly standards, offering diverse methods and perspectives on politics, law and economics. Practical experts and excursions to the decision-making centers of European politics add to the international atmosphere at ZEI in Bonn.\n\nZEI publishes in its own series: \"ZEI Discussion Paper\", the \"Future of Europe Observer\", and \"ZEI Insights\" deal with issues of governance and regulation in the European Union. ZEI also monitors the work of the European Union's institutions and publishes regular comments on progress or failure, including the \"ZEI Monitor\". ZEI scholars also contribute regularly to national and international publications. * Nomos Publishing House (Baden-Baden) publishes the “Schriften des Zentrum für Europäische Integrationsforschung,” edited by ZEI Director Prof. Dr. Ludger Kühnhardt. Until 2016, there have been 76 books published in this series. The Nomos Publishing House offers the leading publishing program on questions of European research in Germany.\n\nIn the field of jurisprudence dealing with network industries, communications and the respective European regulation legislation, ZEI Director Prof. Dr. Christian Koenig is Managing Editor of the journal series\n\nSince 1998, ZEI offers a one-year post-graduate Master program in English: \nThe interdisciplinary “Master of European Studies - Governance and Regulation” features academics and practitioners from across Europe. They cover issues of politics, law and economics related to European integration. The Fellows of ZEI’s “Master of European Studies - Governance and Regulation” are post-graduate students with professional experience from across the EU and worldwide. Their career paths include public institutions, private sector, academia and the media and form a network of more than 500 alumni in over 100 countries.\n\nIn addition, ZEI regularly offers Summer Schools and Mid-Career Training Programs. Particularly noteworthy is the ZEI Academy in Comparative Regional Integration which accompanied ZEI's research on global comparative regional integration studies.\n\n"}

He served two other terms in the House, in the 9th Congress (1797–1799) and 14th Congress (1813–1815). He was elected to the U.S. Senate to complete the term of John Rutherfurd and served there from 1799 to 1801. Between these duties he served a number of years as the Mayor of New Brunswick, New Jersey including 1792–1794, 1801–1813, and 1821–1824. He also represented Middlesex County, New Jersey on the New Jersey Legislative Council for the 1808, 1810, and 1812–1813 sessions of the legislature, serving as Vice-President of Council in the latter session.\n\nWhen Schureman died in 1824 at New Brunswick, he was buried in the churchyard of the First Dutch Reformed Church there. The church and cemetery still stand and are located at Neilson and Bayard Streets.\n\n"}

Thick-walled saltpans were filled with saltwater and heated from below until the water had boiled away and salt was left behind. Often, the bulk of the water would be allowed to evaporate in salterns before the concentrated brine was transferred to a smaller briquetage vessel for final reduction. Once only salt was left, the briquetage vessels would have to be broken to remove the valuable commodity for trade.\n\nBroken briquetage material is found at multiple sites from the later Bronze Age in Europe into the medieval period and archaeologists have been able to identify different forms and fabrics of the pottery, allowing trade networks to be identified. Saltworking sites contain large quantities of the orange/red material and in Essex the mounds of briquetage are known as Red Hills. A recent discovery at the Poiana Slatinei archaeological site next to a salt spring in Lunca, Neamt County, Romania, indicates that Neolithic people of the Precucuteni Culture were boiling the salt-laden spring water through the process of Briquetage to extract the salt as far back as 6050 BC, making it perhaps the oldest saltworks in history.\n"}

Before that, no one in the academic world was aware of its existence. ASC arose when enslaved Gullah speakers from the South Carolina and Georgia coastal region, later called \"Black Seminoles,\" escaped from slavery on rice plantations and fled into the Florida wilderness. This process began in the late 1600s, and continued into the 1830s. In Florida, the Black Seminoles built their own independent communities, but established a close partnership with the Seminole Indians. That alliance helped protect both groups during the First and Second Seminole Wars.\n\nThe present-day speakers of Afro-Seminole Creole live in Seminole County, Oklahoma and Brackettville, Texas in the United States, and in Nacimiento de los Negros, Coahuila, Mexico. ASC is threatened with extinction as there are only about 200 native speakers today. The speakers of ASC are all descendants of the Black Seminoles who settled in Florida and then, through a series of wars and other threats, were driven first to what is now Oklahoma and Northern Mexico, and later into Texas after the Civil War. The speakers of ASC are all 65 years of age or older, so unless actions are soon taken, ASC will likely be extinct in one or two decades.\n\n\n"}

It began on June 4, 1978, and was hosted by jazz pianist Marian McPartland (1918–2013) until 2011. It is the longest-running cultural program on NPR. The show generally features a single guest (though small groups and duos are also featured at times), and usually consists of about an equal mixture of discussion and playing, often duets with McPartland. Initially the guests were limited to jazz pianists, but the format was later expanded to include performers on other instruments as well as other genres (though the performances remain focused on jazz tunes). The show provides an inside look at the relationships of jazz musicians, since McPartland often had long friendships with many of her guests. \"Piano Jazz\" won a Peabody Award in 1983. The show is an exclusive production of South Carolina public radio on WLTR and is offered nationally by NPR.\n\nA number of shows have been released commercially on CD or LP, including shows with Dizzy Gillespie, Bill Evans, Bruce Hornsby, Mary Lou Williams, Shirley Horn, Steely Dan Milt Hinton, Kenny Burrell, Lionel Hampton and Les McCann. These were released on The Jazz Alliance, a subsidiary of Concord Records founded around 1990 for this purpose.\n\nOn November 10, 2011, NPR announced the retirement of Marian McPartland from the program. Jon Weber stepped into McPartland's shoes, recording 13 episodes for the renamed \"Piano Jazz Rising Stars\", broadcast in early 2012 and 2013. It features mainly young musicians such as Whitney James, Jason Moran, Taylor Eigsti and Grace Kelly.

Fußballclub Lokomotive Leipzig e.V. is a German football club based in the city of Leipzig in Saxony and may be more familiar to many of the country's football fans as the historic side VfB Leipzig, the first national champion of Germany. The club won four cup titles and the 1965–66 Intertoto Cup during the East German era. It also finished runner-up in the 1986–87 European Cup Winners' Cup. 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig was renamed VfB Leipzig after efter German re-unification and managed to qualify for the Bundesliga in 1993. However, as many clubs of the former DDR-Oberliga, VfB Leipzig faced hard times in re-unified Germany and a steady decline soon followed. 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig was refounded in 2003 and has reclimbed through divisions. The team competes in the fourth tier Regionalliga Nordost as of 2020.\n\n1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig claims to be the successor to the VfB Leipzig and SC Sportbrüder Leipzig established in 1896 and 1893 respectively, and to be, therefore, one of the oldest clubs of the German Football Association. However, they are not nominally successors. In 2018, 1. FC Lokomotive announced a merger with the formally extant, but bankrupt and dormant VfB Leipzig, in order to be entitled to the forerunner's titles. Due to the significant breaks and turmoils in the club history, especially during the post-World War II era, many fans identify 1966 as the year of establishment rather than 1893.\n\nThe club was formed as VfB Leipzig on 13 May 1896 out of the football department of gymnastics club Allgemeine Turnverein 1845 Leipzig. However, the club lay claim to an earlier date of origin by reaching back to a club that was merged with VfB Leipzig in 1898, the SC Sportbrüder Leipzig, which was one of four football clubs formed in Leipzig in 1893. \n\nFollowing the merger with SC Sportbrüder Leipzig, the club competed under the name VfB Sportbrüder 1893 Leipzig. VfB Sportbrüder 1893 Leipzig was one of the original 86 teams that came together in the city on 28 January 1900 to form the German Football Association (DFB). From 2 May 1900, the Sportbrüder 1893 part of the name was dropped and the team became again known as VfB Leipzig.\nVfB Leipzig were immediately successful at their chosen sport and made their way to the first German national championship final held in 1903. Their opponents were DFC Prag, a German-Jewish side from Prague, which was then part of Austria-Hungary. The DFB had invited \"German\" clubs of this sort from other countries in order to boost numbers in their new national association.\n\nDFC Prag had made their way to the final under circumstances that had allowed them to avoid playing a single playoff match, while VfB Leipzig had come through some hard-fought matches. Arriving in Hamburg for the match, the heavily favoured Pragers took themselves off on an ill-advised pub crawl the night before the contest and so arrived to the pitch in less than ideal match-shape. The contest against was delayed half an hour as officials scrambled to find a football that was in good condition. The host, FC 93 Altona Hamburg, provided a new ball and 11 minutes in, DFC Prag scored the first goal. At the end of the first half, the score stood at 1–1, but VfB Leipzig then pulled away to emerge as the first winners of the Viktoria Meisterschaftstrophäe (\"Victoria Championship Trophy\"), representative of German football supremacy, on the strength of a decisive 7–2 victory.\n\nVfB Leipzig played themselves into another final appearance in 1904, but the match was never contested. A protest by FV Karlsruhe over their disputed semi-final with Britannia Berlin was never resolved and the DFB called off the final only hours before its scheduled start. There would be no champion that year. The following season, VfB Leipzig found themselves unable to cover the expense of travelling to participate in their scheduled first-round playoff match and so were eliminated from that year's competition. However, they did go on to raise the Viktoria again in 1906 and 1913 and also played in the 1911 and 1914 finals.\n\nIn the period leading up to World War II, VfB Leipzig was unable to repeat their early success. After the re-organization of German football leagues under the Third Reich in 1933, the club found itself in Gauliga Sachsen, 1 of 16 upper-tier divisions. While they earned strong results within their own division, they were unable to advance in the playoff rounds. In 1937, they captured the Tschammerpokal, known today as the DFB-Pokal, in a match against Schalke 04, the dominant side of the era.\n\nThe club, like most other organizations in Germany, including sports and football clubs, was dissolved by the occupying Allied authorities in the aftermath of the war. Club members reconstituted the team in 1946 as SG Probstheida under the auspices of the occupying Soviets. After playing as BSG Erich Zeigner Probstheida and then BSG Einheit Ost, the club merged with sports club SC Rotation Leipzig in 1954 and played in the DDR-Oberliga, East Germany's top-flight league, but earned only mediocre results. In 1963, the city of Leipzig's two most important sports clubs – SC Rotation and SC Lokomotive Leipzig – were merged, resulting in two new sides being founded: SC Leipzig and BSG Chemie Leipzig.\n\nEast German football went through a general re-organization in 1965, creating football clubs as centres of high-level football, during which the football department of SC Leipzig was separated from the sports club and reformed into football club 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig, while rivals Chemie Leipzig continued as a Betriebssportgemeinschaft (BSG), or a corporate team. Like most East German clubs, it was assigned to a publicly owned enterprise as its \"sponsor\". In the case of Lokomotive, the providing enterprise was Deutsche Reichsbahn—the East German state railways—hence the name. The club's fortunes improved somewhat as they almost always finished well up the league table, but they were unable to capture the top honour in the DDR (German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik or German Democratic Republic) with losing final appearances in 1967, 1986, and 1988.\n\n\"Lok\" earned a clutch of East German Cups \"(FDGB Pokal)\" with victories in 1976, 1981, 1986 and 1987 against failed appearances in the Cup final in 1970, 1973 and 1977. They also won the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 1966 and made an appearance in the 1987 final of the European Cup Winners' Cup, falling 0–1 to Johan Cruyff's Ajax after a Marco van Basten goal.\n\nRe-unification in 1990 was followed by the merger of the football leagues of the two Germanys a year later. A poor season led to a seventh-place finish in the transitional league, but an unexpectedly strong playoff propelled the club into the 2. Bundesliga.\n\n1. FC Lokomotive made a grasp at their former glory by re-claiming the name VfB Leipzig. A third-place finish in 1993 advanced the team to the top-flight Bundesliga, where they finished last in the 1994 season. The new VfB began a steady slide down through the 2. Bundesliga into the Regionalliga Nordost (III) by 1998 and then further still to the NOFV-Oberliga Süd (IV) by 2001. They were bankrupted in 2004, their results were annulled and the club was dissolved.\n\nIn late 2003, the club was re-established by a group of fans as 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig. The renewed side had to start in the lowest league eleventh-tier 3. Kreisklasse, Staffel 2 in 2004–05. Even so, they continued to receive solidly enthusiastic fan support: their match against Eintracht Großdeuben's second team in the Leipzig Zentralstadion on 9 October 2004 broke the world record for lower-league attendance with 12,421 spectators. Thanks to a merger with SSV Torgau, the club could play in the seventh-tier Bezirksklasse Leipzig, Staffel 2 in 2005–06. Finishing this league as champions, the team qualified for the sixth-tier Bezirksliga. In 2006, Lok Leipzig also played a friendly match against FC United of Manchester (4–4) and qualified for the 2006–07 Landespokal by winning the Bezirkspokal. Lokomotive Leipzig finished as champions of their group and promoted to fifth-tier Landesliga Sachsen Group for 2007–08 season. The club finished second to Erzgebirge Aue and missed out on direct promotion to NOFV-Oberliga Süd by two points in 2007–08 season. It still had the chance to regain Oberliga status through a relegation play-off with Schönberg, winning the first leg 2–1 at Schönberg. In the return leg, in front of almost 10,000 spectators, the club lost 0–1 but still gained Oberliga promotion via the away goals rule.\n\nLokomotive Leipzig finished Oberliga in third place in 2008–09, 12th in 2009–10 and eighth in 2010–11. Lokomotive Leipzig was promoted to Regionalliga Nordost after finishing Oberliga as sixth due to reserve teams of FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt, Dynamo Dresden and Carl Zeiss Jena being ineligible for promotion. Lokomotive finished in tenth place in the 2012–13 season but were relegated to Oberliga Nordost after finishing 15th in 2013–14.\n\nThe club stayed in contention for promotion back up to the Regionalliga during the 2014–15 season, having hired former German international Mario Basler as director of sports in early 2015. In the final match of the season, Lok supporters stormed the field after their club had fallen behind 2–0, forcing the match to be abandoned and the club to finish outside of the promotion ranks. The club finished in first place in the southern group of the NOFV-Oberliga and returned to Regionalliga Nordost for the 2016–17 season.\n\nThe club's fans share a fierce and often violent rivalry with the supporters of Chemie Leipzig. When both teams met in the quarter finals of the Sachsenpokal in 2016, German daily newspaper \"Die Welt\" called the match the \"German hooligan summit\". An additional reason for the enmity between some fan groups (namely their ultras) is a political one. Whereas certain Chemie fan clubs express left-wing and anti-fascist political views, Lok has vocal supporters from the right and far-right of the political spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBSG Leipzig-Ost\n\nSC Rotation Leipzig\n\nSC Leipzig\n\n1. FC Lok Leipzig\n\nVfB Leipzig\n\n1. FC Lok Leipzig\n\n1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig has underwent several reorganizations during its history and has taken several names and forms.

She was the co-founder and partner of law firm Lee & Lee.\n\nKwa Geok Choo was the daughter of Kwa Siew Tee, former general manager of Oversea-Chinese Bank and Singapore Municipal Commissioner who was a Tong'anese on his paternal side who also had a Teochew mother, and Wee Yew Neo, Geok Choo's Teochew mother from Shantou. Kwa attended the Methodist Girls' School, Raffles Institution and Raffles College, and was a Queen's Scholar of Malaya. According to Lee Kuan Yew's memoirs, by 1939, Kwa and Lee were both top students in Raffles, often coming first and second in exams. They continued their courtship during the Japanese occupation when their studies were disrupted. After the war, Kwa resumed her studies at Raffles College in 1946 while Lee left Singapore to pursue his law degree at the University of Cambridge. Kwa was admitted to Girton College in 1947, after Lee petitioned for her, saying she was \"a very bright girl, brighter than I was\". She graduated with first-class honours in 1949 and was called to the bar in the subsequent year. She returned to Singapore and was admitted to the Colony Bar in 1951. Kwa was one of the few female lawyers of the country then, practising at Laycock & Ong.\n\nKwa married Lee in secret in London in 1947 and then remarried in Singapore on 30 September 1950. They had two sons – Lee Hsien Loong and Lee Hsien Yang – and a daughter – Lee Wei Ling. Her brother, Kwa Soon Bee, served as a Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health. She had three sisters: Mrs Cheah, a teacher at Methodist Girls' School; Mrs Yong, the wife of Yong Nyuk Lin; and Mrs Earnest Lau, who was also a teacher at Methodist Girls School.\n\nOn 1 September 1955, Kwa Geok Choo founded law firm Lee & Lee with Lee Kuan Yew and Dennis Lee Kim Yew. Kwa practised conveyancing and legal draftsmanship. She retired from partnership in 1987 but stayed on as a consultant thereafter.\n\nDuring Lee's years as Prime Minister and Senior Minister, Kwa was frequently seen with her husband, especially on diplomatic trips and meetings with other foreign ministers. After suffering two strokes in May and June 2008, she was bedridden and developed locked-in syndrome, being unable to speak, but remained conscious and able to understand speech.\n\nKwa Geok Choo was a founding member of the People’s Action Party (PAP) and helped to draft the PAP Constitution. She made her first political speech on Radio Malaya on PAP's policy on women before the 1959 elections, advocating equal pay for women and for monogamous marriages. She mostly stayed out of the political limelight throughout her husband's career.\n\nWhen Singapore separated from the Malaysian Federation, Kwa drafted the clauses in the Separation Agreement for the guarantee of the water agreements between the Malaysian state of Johor and Singapore. This guarantee was done via an amendment to the Federal Constitution of Malaysia.\n\nKwa was also a pioneer advocate of women's rights in Singapore. She spoke on family planning, and supported legal protection for women. Together with other women’s activists such as Chan Choy Siong, Kwa's suggestions were included into the landmark 1961 Women’s Charter, which sought to improve and protect the legal rights of women.\n\nKwa died in her sleep at home, following a long illness on 2 October 2010 around 0540 hours SST. She was given a state funeral and cremated at Mandai Crematorium on 7 October 2010.\n\nIn 2011, the Singapore Management University named its new law library, a new scholars programme and a top law graduate award after Kwa. In the same year, the National University of Singapore established a professorship in property law, a distinguished visitors programme, bursaries and scholarships in her honour. Nanyang Girls' High School also unveiled a bust of Kwa at its Yu Zhi Library, which is named after her. Her alma mater, the Methodist Girls' School, named their auditorium in her honour after it was refurbished in 2011.\n\nSingapore's Peranakan Museum currently displays Kwa's barrister wig on its third floor.\n\nIn 2011, former \"Far Eastern Economic Review\" comic artist Morgan Chua released \"In Memory of Kwa Geok Choo (1921-2010)\", a book of sketches and political cartoons in tribute to her.\n\nIn October 2014, the Madame Tussauds Singapore museum unveiled wax figures of Kwa and Lee Kuan Yew seated and smiling together against a backdrop of red flowers formed in the shape of two hearts. The statues were created based on a photograph that was taken by Kwa's niece, Kwa Kim Li, of the pair on Valentine's Day in 2008 at Sentosa.\n\nIn the same month, Cultural Medallion recipient Tan Swie Hian completed a painting of Kwa and Lee Kuan Yew entitled \"A Couple\". The painting, which took Tan five years to complete, was partially damaged by a fire in 2013. It depicts Kwa and Lee in their youth, is based on a 1946 black-and-white photograph of the couple in the University of Cambridge, and incorporates in its background Tan's poem written in memory of Kwa. Tan said, \"I have always felt [Madam Kwa] was a great woman who, despite her intelligence and capability, was also a humble and dedicated wife.\" \"A Couple\" was donated to the National Library of Singapore in 2017 and is displayed at the National Library Building in Victoria Street. She remains symbolic as a recognised leader who impacted generations to come particularly on sensitive issues regarding water.\n\n\n"}

It may be used together with rest, physical therapy, and pain medication. It is less preferred in low back pain. It has limited use for rheumatoid arthritis and cerebral palsy. Effects generally begin within half an hour. It is taken by mouth or injection into a vein.\nCommon side effect include headaches, sleepiness, dizziness. Serious side effects may include anaphylaxis, liver problems, confusion, and seizures. Use is not recommended in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Use by the elderly is considered high risk. Methocarbamol is a centrally acting muscle relaxant. How it works is unclear, but it does not appear to affect muscles directly.\nMethocarbamol was approved for medical use in the United States in 1957. It is available as a generic medication. It is relatively inexpensive as of 2016. In 2017, it was the 178th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than three million prescriptions.\n\nMethocarbamol is a muscle relaxant used to treat acute, painful musculoskeletal spasms in a variety of musculoskeletal conditions. However, there is limited and inconsistent published research on the medication's efficacy and safety in treating musculoskeletal conditions, primarily neck and back pain.\n\nMethocarbamol injection may have a beneficial effect in the control of the neuromuscular spasms of tetanus. It does not, however, replace the current treatment regimen.\n\nIt is not useful in chronic neurological disorders, such as cerebral palsy or other dyskinesias.\n\nCurrently, there is some suggestion that muscle relaxants may improve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis; however, there is insufficient data to prove its effectiveness as well as answer concerns regarding optimal dosing, choice of muscle relaxant, adverse effects, and functional status.\n\nThe clinical effectiveness of methocarbamol compared to other muscle relaxants is not well-known. One trial of methocarbamol versus cyclobenzaprine, a well-studied muscle relaxant, in those with localized muscle spasm found there was no significant differences in their effects on improved muscle spasm, limitation of motion, or limitation of daily activities.\n\nThere are few contraindications to methocarbamol. They include:\n\n\nMethocarbamol is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant that has significant adverse effects, especially on the central nervous system.\n\nPotential side effects of methocarbamol include:\n\n\nWhile the product label states that methocarbamol can cause jaundice, there is minimal evidence to suggest that methocarbamol causes liver damage. During clinical trials of methocarbamol, there were no laboratory measurements of liver damage indicators, such as serum aminotransferase (AST/ALT) levels, to confirm hepatotoxicity. Although unlikely, it is impossible to rule out that methocarbamol may cause mild liver injury with use.\n\nSkeletal muscle relaxants are associated with an increased risk of injury among older adults. Methocarbamol appeared to be less sedating than other muscle relaxants, most notably cyclobenzaprine, but had similar increased risk of injury. The medication was listed on the 2012 Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults and is considered to be a high-risk medication for the elderly.\n\nMethocarbamol is labeled by the FDA as a pregnancy category C medication. The teratogenic effects of the medication are not known and should be given to pregnant women only when clearly indicated.\n\nThere is limited information available on the acute toxicity of methocarbamol. Overdose is used frequently in conjunction with CNS depressants such as alcohol or benzodiazepines and will have symptoms of nausea, drowsiness, blurred vision, hypotension, seizures, and coma. There are reported deaths with an overdose of methocarbamol alone or in the presence of other CNS depressants.\n\nUnlike other carbamates such as meprobamate and its prodrug carisoprodol, methocarbamol has greatly reduced abuse potential. Studies comparing it to the benzodiazepine lorazepam and the antihistamine diphenhydramine, along with placebo, find that methocarbamol produces increased \"liking\" responses and some sedative-like effects; however, at higher doses dysphoria is reported. It is considered to have an abuse profile similar to, but weaker than, lorazepam.\n\nMethocarbamol may inhibit the effects of pyridostigmine bromide. Therefore, methocarbamol should be used with caution in those with myasthenia gravis taking anticholinesterase medications.\n\nMethocarbamol may disrupt certain screening tests as it can cause color interference in laboratory tests for 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and in urinary testing for vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) using the Gitlow method.\n\nThe mechanism of action of methocarbamol has not currently been established. Its effect is thought to be localized to the central nervous system rather than a direct effect on skeletal muscles. It has no effect on the motor end plate or the peripheral nerve fiber. The efficacy of the medication is likely related to its sedative effect.\n\nIn healthy individuals, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg. The mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. The elimination half-life was longer in the elderly, those with kidney problems, and those with liver problems.\n\nMethocarbamol is the carbamate derivative of guaifenesin, but does not produce guaifenesin as a metabolite, because the carbamate bond is not hydrolyzed metabolically; its metabolism is by Phase I ring hydroxylation and \"O\"-demethylation, followed by Phase II conjugation. All the major metabolites are unhydrolyzed carbamates. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol are also excreted in the urine.\n\nMethocarbamol was approved as a muscle relaxant for acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in the United States in 1957. Muscle relaxants are widely used to treat low back pain, one of the most frequent health problems in industrialized countries. Currently, there are more than 3 million prescriptions filled yearly. Methocarbamol and orphenadrine are each used in more than 250,000 U.S. emergency department visits for lower back pain each year. In the United States, low back pain is the fifth most common reason for all physician visits and the second most common symptomatic reason. In 80% of primary care visits for low back pain, at least one medication was prescribed at the initial office visit and more than one third were prescribed two or more medications. The most commonly prescribed drugs for low back pain included skeletal muscle relaxants. Cyclobenzaprine and methocarbamol are on the U.S. Medicare formulary, which may account for the higher use of these products.\n\nThe generic formulation of the medication is relatively inexpensive, costing less than the alternative metaxalone in 2016. In the UK, the NHS pays about £13 for 100 tablets of 750 mg of methocarbamol as of 2019. In the US the wholesale cost of this quantity is about US$10 as of 2020.\n\nMethocarbamol without other ingredients is sold under the brand name Robaxin in the U.K., U.S. and Canada; it is marketed as Lumirelax in France, Ortoton in Germany and many other names worldwide. In combination with other active ingredients it is sold under other names: with acetaminophen (paracetamol), under trade names Robaxacet and Tylenol Body Pain Night; with ibuprofen as Robax Platinum; with acetylsalicylic acid as Robaxisal in the U.S. and Canada. However, in Spain the tradename Robaxisal is used for the paracetamol combination instead of Robaxacet. These combinations are also available from independent manufacturers under generic names.\n\nAlthough opioids are a typically first line in treatment of severe pain, several trials suggest that methocarbamol may improve recovery and decrease hospital length of stay in those with muscles spasms associated with rib fractures. However, methocarbamol was less useful in the treatment of acute traumatic pain in general.\n\nLong-term studies evaluating the risk of development of cancer in using methocarbamol have not been performed. There are currently no studies evaluating the effect of methocarbamol on mutagenesis or fertility.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of methocarbamol has not been established in pediatric individuals below the age of 16 except in tetanus.\n"}

It is based on the 1979 novel \"Death Bite\" by Michael Maryk and Brent Monahan.\n\nAccording to \"Filmink\" the movie \"kicked off his [Fonda's] straight to video phase that lasted through the ‘80s.\"\nReclusive millionaire philanthropist Jason Kincaid lost his brother to a massive taipan serpent during a hunting trip in Micronesia. The snake also bit him, but rather than dying from the venom he survived and seemingly developed a telepathic link with the creature, caused by the venom mutating the brain cells responsible for extrasensory perception. Haunted by visions of the snake's continued killings, Kincaid pays to have a poacher capture it and deliver it to his mansion outside San Diego. He hires psychiatrist and ESP researcher Tom Brasilian in the hopes that he can help him rid of the unwanted psychic link once and for all. In exchange, Kincaid offers to underwrite all of Brasilian's on-going research.\n\nHowever, a Satanic cult also has its eyes on the snake. As it is worshiped by the indigenous natives as the guardian of their underworld, they believe that it is, in fact, a demon and hopes to acquire it for worship. The cult hires ex-CIA agent Warren Crowley to steal the snake. Crowley bribes a sailor on the ship transporting it to the United States to help secure it, but the mole is killed when he attempts to look inside the snake's container and is bitten. The venom causes his blood vessels and visceral tissues to rapidly swell and he dies by falling overboard.\n\nAs Brasilian insists on keeping the snake at his university laboratory until Kincaid's private lab is constructed, he oversees its transportation there, unknowingly being tailed by Crowley and his minder Deacon Tyrone. Kincaid's niece Suzanne, believing that his psychic link is actually a delusion brought on by the trauma of her father's death, attempts to kill the snake by secretly increasing the temperature of its container to a lethal 150 degrees. That night, Crowley and Tyrone break into the lab. Tyrone, realizing that the snake is overheated, opens the container. The snake promptly breaks loose and kills Tyrone and the lab director before escaping outside. Brasilian and Suzanne are summoned to the site by police, while Kincaid senses that the snake has broken loose.\n\nBrasilian surmises that the snake must go to a temperate environment, and searches a nearby greenhouse with Suzanne. The snake attacks them, and Brasilian barely manages to fend it off with a fire extinguisher. Police arrive, but Kincaid manages to ward them off by convincing them of the danger the creature poses. All three are taken into custody, and police are skeptical of Kincaid's claims and threaten to charge him with manslaughter for illicitly importing such a deadly animal. Meanwhile, the snake attacks a nearby a house and kills its inhabitants, an act Kincaid witnesses through his mental link.\n\nCrowley is threatened by the cult for his failure to secure the snake. He bribes the location of Kincaid's residence and travels there by van, believing the snake will eventually travel there at which point he can capture it. Meanwhile, Brasilian determines that Kincaid's psychic link can be used to track down the snake before it strikes again. He hooks him up to a brain-pattern monitoring device, and Kincaid begins having a telepathic episode, seeing the snake arrive at his house and kill Crowley. Kincaid can only shout out a few cryptic words before the connection is lost, and disappears before he can be questioned any further. Suzanne realizes that he was referring to their house, and she and Brasilian race to intercept him.\n\nKincaid arrives at the house, where the snake has already killed a groundskeeper. Picking up an assault rifle, he searches the grounds but is repeatedly struck by more and more intense visions of the snake's previous kills, losing his gun in the process. Finally, he confronts the creature in the backyard, where the psychic energy causes spontaneous explosions around the two. He attacks it with a knife, but it quickly gains the upper hand and kills him. Brasilian and Suzanne arrive, and Brasilian picks up Kincaid's gun and shoots the snake to death. He and Suzanne leave as the snake's remains burn side-by-side with Kincaid.\n\nWriters Michael Maryk and Brent Monahan wrote the novel \"Death Bite\" in 1979 to cash in on the success of Peter Benchley’s ‘’Jaws’’, in the hopes that their novel would likewise be turned into a feature film. Hollywood agent Martin Erlichman bought the rights to the novel for $5,000 for one year. According to Monahan, Erlichman was fond of optioning screenplays on spec, and had file cabinets filled with the works of many anxious writers seeking to hit it big. Having done nothing with the ‘’Death Bite’’ property in the interim, and only a couple months remaining on his option, Erlichman sought to take advantage of the tax breaks afforded in Canada's film industry at that time.\n\nThe film was originally announced in January 1981 newspaper reports to begin shooting in February of that year. During the planning stages, the original aim was to use live snakes for portions of the attack sequences. Herpetologist and snake wrangler Bob Zappalorti was going to provide the reptiles and Raymond Mendez, a well known model-maker, insect wrangler, and photographer would create hand puppets for close-ups. A 14 foot Indian Rock Python was bought and stored in NYC for almost a year before the idea of using real reptiles was discarded.\n\nAs pre-production went on, the film went through several rewrites and different directors who eventually left when principal photography failed to materialize. When filming finally started, original production studio Filmpro Limited went bankrupt less than a week in, and banking firm Cinequity Corporation took over bringing two inexperienced men on board as producers. Fearing the film would fail to stand-out among the trend of “animal attack” movies coming out at the time, Cinequity rewrote the script to add supernatural elements, replaced the wrangled snakes with animatronics, and brought on-board director William Fruet in May 1981.\n\nFilming took place in-and-around various locations in Toronto, Ontario. The Kincaid estate was Valley Halla Estate by the Rouge River, and the opening sequence was filmed at Scarborough Bluffs Park. The animatronics used to realize the snake were designed by Mendez and Neal Martz. Originally six different snakes—each performing its own function—were to be built, but with a limited amount of money and time constraints, this idea was scrapped and doing as much as possible with a single mechanical snake was considered more feasible. While filming commenced in Canada, Mendez and his small crew of six built their robot monster in New York in autonomy over the course of eight weeks between August and October 1981. Two 22 ft bodies, three 6 ft necks to accommodate an armature, and puppet heads were used to bring creatures to life. The gore effects, including the graphic results of the snake's bite, were designed and realized by Academy Award-winning makeup artists Dick Smith and Stephan Dupuis, and featured heavily the former's signature air bladder technique. Invited to watch the filming in Toronto, both Maryk and Monahan left after three days upon becoming irritated with the constant alterations being made to their work.\n\nDespite the impressive nature of the finished product, Fruet was unsatisfied with how it looked on-screen when interacting with the live actors, and limited its appearance in the final film through the use of POV shots and quick edits. A climactic end battle between Oliver Reed and the snake was planned and filmed. It included scenes of the snake partially swallowing Reed's arm, and him stabbing and dismembering it with a knife. Fruet was unsatisfied with the effects, and heavily re-edited the sequence, cutting most of the snake's appearances and padding it out with flashbacks. Other extended, gory sequences were either planned or filmed, including a nightmare sequence in which some victims of the snake show up covered with graphic wounds. Fruet claims that additional shots with more graphic violence were filmed specifically for the East Asian release of the film.\n\nFonda said in 1990 that \"They couldn't figure out how to end the damn film. I told Ollie that it's up to him to make that huge snake look good...'You've got to make it look like it's going to kill you Ollie!' He was probably sober part of the time. It's really too bad. He’s a joke on himself. You know, the poor guy is very talented. It's just that he's simply become a caricature of himself.\" \n\nThe film was given a limited release theatrically in the United States by Producers Distributing Corporation in May 1984. The film was released on VHS by Thorn EMI.\n\nIn April 2016, CodeRed released the film on DVD and Blu-ray for the first time. Because the print used for the release was missing a reel, CodeRed substituted with Standard Definition footage from a VHS master.\n\nThe film's score was composed by Eric Robertson. Tangerine Dream contributed the original theme over the end credits.\n\n"}

{"id": "2073462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073462", "title": "Second-order cybernetics", "text": "Second-order cybernetics\n\nSecond-order cybernetics, also known as the cybernetics of cybernetics, is the recursive application of cybernetics to itself. It was developed between approximately 1968 and 1975 by Margaret Mead, Heinz von Foerster and others. Von Foerster referred to it as the cybernetics of \"observing systems\" whereas first order cybernetics is that of \"observed systems\". It is sometimes referred to as the \"new cybernetics\", the term preferred by Gordon Pask, and is closely allied to radical constructivism, which was developed around the same time by Ernst von Glasersfeld. While it is sometimes considered a radical break from the earlier concerns of cybernetics, there is much continuity with previous work and it can be thought of as the completion of the discipline, responding to issues evident during the Macy conferences in which cybernetics was initially developed. Its concerns include epistemology, ethics, autonomy, self-consistency, self-referentiality, and self-organizing capabilities of complex systems. It has been characterised as cybernetics where \"circularity is taken seriously\".\n\nSecond-order Cybernetics can be abbreviated as C2 or SOC, and is sometimes referred to as the cybernetics of cybernetics, the new cybernetics or second cybernetics. The terms are often used interchangeably, but can also stress different aspects:\n\nSecond-order cybernetics took shape during the late 1960s and mid 1970s. The 1967 keynote address to the inaugural meeting of the American Society for Cybernetics (ASC), Margaret Mead, who had been a participant at the Macy Conferences, is a defining moment in its development. She characterised \"cybernetics as a way of looking at things and as a language for expressing what one sees\". This paper was social and ecological in focus, with Mead calling on cyberneticians to assume responsibility for the social consequences of the language of cybernetics and the development of cybernetic systems.\n\nMead's paper concluded with a proposal directed at the ASC itself, that it organise itself in the light of the ideas with which it was concerned. That is, the practice of Cybernetics by the ASC should be subject to Cybernetic critique, an idea returned to specially by Ranulph Glanville in his time as president of the society.\n\nMead's paper was published in 1968 in a collection edited by Heinz von Foerster. With Mead uncontactable due to field work at the time, von Foerster titled the paper \"Cybernetics of Cybernetics\", a title that perhaps emphasised his concerns more than Mead's. Von Foerster promoted Second-order Cybernetics energetically, developing it as a means of renewal for Cybernetics generally and as what has been called an \"unfinished revolution\" in science. Von Foerster's developed Second-order Cybernetics as a critique of realism and objectivity and as a radically reflexive form of science, where observers enter their domains of observation, describing their own observing not the supposed causes.\n\nThe initial development of second-order cybernetics was consolidated by the mid 1970s in a series of significant developments and publications:\n\nHeinz von Foerster attributes the origin of second-order cybernetics to the attempts of cyberneticians to construct a model of the mind:\n\n... a brain is required to write a theory of a brain. From this follows that a theory of the brain, that has any aspirations for completeness, has to account for the writing of this theory. And even more fascinating, the writer of this theory has to account for her or himself. Translated into the domain of cybernetics; the cybernetician, by entering his own domain, has to account for his or her own activity. Cybernetics then becomes cybernetics of cybernetics, or \"second-order cybernetics\".\nMany cyberneticians draw a sharp distinction between first and second order cybernetics, others stress the continuity between the two, and the implicit second order qualities of earlier cybernetics.\nThe anthropologists Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead contrasted first and second-order cybernetics with this diagram in an interview in 1973. Referring to the Macy conferences, it emphasises the requirement for a participant observer in the second order case:\n\nIn 1992, Pask summarized the differences between the old and the new cybernetics as a shift in emphasis:.\n\nSome biologists influenced by cybernetic concepts (Maturana and Varela, 1980; Varela, 1979; Atlan, 1979) realized that the cybernetic metaphors of the program upon which molecular biology had been based rendered a conception of the autonomy of the living being impossible. Consequently, these thinkers were led to invent a new cybernetics, one more suited to the organization mankind discovers in nature – organizations he has not himself invented. The possibility that this new cybernetics could also account for social forms of organization, remained an object of debate among theoreticians on self-organization in the 1980s.\n\nIn political science in the 1980s unlike its predecessor, the new cybernetics concerns itself with the interaction of autonomous political actors and subgroups and the practical reflexive consciousness of the subject who produces and reproduces the structure of political community. A dominant consideration is that of recursiveness, or self-reference of political action both with regard to the expression of political consciousness and with the ways in which systems build upon themselves.\n\nIn 1978, Geyer and van der Zouwen discuss a number of characteristics of the emerging \"new cybernetics\". One characteristic of new cybernetics is that it views information as constructed by an individual interacting with the environment. This provides a new epistemological foundation of science, by viewing it as observer-dependent. Another characteristic of the new cybernetics is its contribution towards bridging the \"micro-macro gap\". That is, it links the individual with the society. Geyer and van der Zouten also noted that a transition from classical cybernetics to new cybernetics involves a transition from classical problems to new problems. These shifts in the thinking involve, among other things, a change in emphasis on the system being steered to the system doing the steering, and the factors which guide the steering decisions. And a new emphasis on communication between several systems which are trying to steer each other.\n\nGeyer & J. van der Zouwen (1992) recognize four themes in both sociocybernetics and new cybernetics:\n\nOther topics where new cybernetics is developed are: \n\nOrganizational cybernetics is distinguished from management cybernetics. Both use many of the same terms but interpret them according to another philosophy of systems thinking. Organizational cybernetics by contrast offers a significant break with the assumption of the hard approach. The full flowering of organizational cybernetics is represented by Beer's viable system model.\n\nOrganizational cybernetics studies organizational design, and the regulation and self-regulation of organizations from a systems theory perspective that also takes the social dimension into consideration. Researchers in economics, public administration and political science focus on the changes in institutions, organisation and mechanisms of social steering at various levels (sub-national, national, European, international) and in different sectors (including the private, semi-private and public sectors; the latter sector is emphasised).\n\nThe reformulation of sociocybernetics as an \"actor-oriented, observer-dependent, self-steering, time-variant\" paradigm of human systems, was most clearly articulated by Geyer and van der Zouwen in 1978 and 1986. They stated that sociocybernetics is more than just social cybernetics, which could be defined as the application of the general systems approach to social science. Social cybernetics is indeed more than such a one-way knowledge transfer. It implies a feed-back loop from the area of application – the social sciences – to the theory being applied, namely cybernetics; consequently, sociocybernetics can indeed be viewed as part of the new cybernetics: as a result of its application to social science problems, cybernetics, itself, has been changed and has moved from its originally rather mechanistic point of departure to become more actor-oriented and observer-dependent.\nIn summary, the new sociocybernetics is much more subjective and the sociological approach than the classical cybernetics approach with its emphasis on control. The new approach has a distinct emphasis on steering decisions; furthermore, it can be seen as constituting a reconceptualization of many concepts which are often routinely accepted without challenge.\n\nAndrew Pickering has criticised second order cybernetics as a form of linguistic turn, moving away from the performative practices he finds valuable in earlier cybernetics. Pickering's comments seem to apply specifically to where second order cybernetics has emphasised epistemology and language, for instance in the work of von Foerster, as he approvingly references the work of figures such as Bateson and Pask and the idea of participant observers which fall within the scope of second order cybernetics more broadly considered.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2073470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073470", "title": "Manifold", "text": "Manifold\n\nIn mathematics, a manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. More precisely, each point of an \"n\"-dimensional manifold has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to the Euclidean space of dimension \"n\". In this more precise terminology, a manifold is referred to as an \"n\"-manifold.\n\nOne-dimensional manifolds include lines and circles, but not figure eights (because no neighborhood of their crossing point is homeomorphic to Euclidean 1-space). Two-dimensional manifolds are also called surfaces. Examples include the plane, the sphere, and the torus, which can all be embedded (formed without self-intersections) in three dimensional real space, but also the Klein bottle and real projective plane, which will always self-intersect when immersed in three-dimensional real space.\n\nAlthough a manifold locally resembles Euclidean space, meaning that every point has a neighbourhood homeomorphic to an open subset of Euclidean space, globally it may be not homeomorphic to Euclidean space. For example, the surface of the sphere is not homeomorphic to the Euclidean plane, because (among other properties) it has the global topological property of compactness that Euclidean space lacks, but in a region it can be charted by means of map projections of the region into the Euclidean plane (in the context of manifolds they are called \"charts\"). When a region appears in two neighbouring charts, the two representations do not coincide exactly and a transformation is needed to pass from one to the other, called a \"transition map\".\n\nThe concept of a manifold is central to many parts of geometry and modern mathematical physics because it allows complicated structures to be described and understood in terms of the simpler local topological properties of Euclidean space. Manifolds naturally arise as solution sets of systems of equations and as graphs of functions.\n\nManifolds can be equipped with additional structure. One important class of manifolds is the class of differentiable manifolds; this differentiable structure allows calculus to be done on manifolds. A Riemannian metric on a manifold allows distances and angles to be measured. Symplectic manifolds serve as the phase spaces in the Hamiltonian formalism of classical mechanics, while four-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds model spacetime in general relativity.\n\nA surface is a two dimensional manifold, meaning that it locally resembles the Euclidean plane near each point. For example, the surface of a globe can be described by a collection of maps (called charts), which together form an atlas of the globe. Although no individual map is sufficient to cover the entire surface of the globe, any place in the globe will be in at least one of the charts. \n\nMany places will appear in more than one chart. For example, a map of North America will likely include parts of South America and the Arctic circle. These regions of the globe will be described in full in separate charts, which in turn will contain parts of North America. There is a relation between adjacent charts, called a \"transition map\" that allows them to be consistently patched together to \ncover the whole of the globe.\n\nDescribing the coordinate charts on surfaces explicitly requires knowledge of functions of two variables, because these patching functions must map a region in the plane to another region of the plane. However, one-dimensional examples of manifolds (or curves) can be described with functions of a single variable only.\n\nManifolds have applications in computer-graphics and augmented-reality given the need to associate pictures (texture) to coordinates (e.g. CT scans).\nIn an augmented reality setting, a picture (tangent plane) can be seen as something associated with a coordinate and by using sensors for detecting movements and rotation one can have knowledge of how the picture is oriented and placed in space. \n\nAfter a line, the circle is the simplest example of a topological manifold. Topology ignores bending, so a small piece of a circle is treated exactly the same as a small piece of a line. Consider, for instance, the top part of the unit circle, \"x\" + \"y\" = 1, where the \"y\"-coordinate is positive (indicated by the yellow circular arc in \"Figure 1\"). Any point of this arc can be uniquely described by its \"x\"-coordinate. So, projection onto the first coordinate is a continuous, and invertible, mapping from the upper arc to the open interval (−1, 1):\n\nSuch functions along with the open regions they map are called \"charts\". Similarly, there are charts for the bottom (red), left (blue), and right (green) parts of the circle:\n\nTogether, these parts cover the whole circle and the four charts form an atlas for the circle.\n\nThe top and right charts, formula_3 and formula_4 respectively, overlap in their domain: their intersection lies in the quarter of the circle where both the formula_5- and the formula_6-coordinates are positive. Each map this part into the interval formula_7, though differently. Thus a function formula_8 can be constructed, which takes values from the co-domain of formula_3 back to the circle using the inverse, followed by the formula_4 back to the interval. Let \"a\" be any number in formula_7, then:\n\nSuch a function is called a \"transition map\".\n\nThe top, bottom, left, and right charts show that the circle is a manifold, but they do not form the only possible atlas. Charts need not be geometric projections, and the number of charts is a matter of choice. Consider the charts\n\nand\n\nHere \"s\" is the slope of the line through the point at coordinates (\"x\", \"y\") and the fixed pivot point (−1, 0); similarly, \"t\" is the opposite of the slope of the line through the points at coordinates (\"x\", \"y\") and (+1, 0). The inverse mapping from \"s\" to (\"x\", \"y\") is given by\n\nIt can easily be confirmed that \"x\" + \"y\" = 1 for all values of \"s\" and \"t\". These two charts provide a second atlas for the circle, with the transition map\n(that is, one has this relation between \"s\" and \"t\" for every point where \"s\" and \"t\" are both nonzero).\n\nEach chart omits a single point, either (−1, 0) for \"s\" or (+1, 0) for \"t\", so neither chart alone is sufficient to cover the whole circle. It can be proved that it is not possible to cover the full circle with a single chart. For example, although it is possible to construct a circle from a single line interval by overlapping and \"gluing\" the ends, this does not produce a chart; a portion of the circle will be mapped to both ends at once, losing invertibility.\n\nThe sphere is an example of a surface. The unit sphere of implicit equation\nmay be covered by an atlas of six charts: the plane divides the sphere into two half spheres ( and ), which may both be mapped on the disc by the projection on the plane of coordinates. This provides two charts; the four other charts are provided by a similar construction with the two other coordinate planes.\n\nAs for the circle, one may define one chart that covers the whole sphere excluding one point. Thus two charts are sufficient, but the sphere cannot be covered by a single chart.\n\nThis example is historically significant, as it has motivated the terminology; it became apparent that the whole surface of the Earth cannot have a plane representation consisting of a single map (also called \"chart\", see nautical chart), and therefore one needs atlases for covering the whole Earth surface.\n\nViewed using calculus, the circle transition function \"T\" is simply a function between open intervals, which gives a meaning to the statement that \"T\" is differentiable. The transition map \"T\", and all the others, are differentiable on (0, 1); therefore, with this atlas the circle is a \"differentiable manifold\". It is also \"smooth\" and \"analytic\" because the transition functions have these properties as well.\n\nOther circle properties allow it to meet the requirements of more specialized types of manifold. For example, the circle has a notion of distance between two points, the arc-length between the points; hence it is a \"Riemannian manifold\".\n\nManifolds need not be connected (all in \"one piece\"); an example is a pair of separate circles.\n\nManifolds need not be closed; thus a line segment without its end points is a manifold. And they are never countable, unless the dimension of the manifold is 0. Putting these freedoms together, other examples of manifolds are a parabola, a hyperbola (two open, infinite pieces), and the locus of points on a cubic curve (a closed loop piece and an open, infinite piece).\n\nHowever, excluded are examples like two touching circles that share a point to form a figure-8; at the shared point a satisfactory chart cannot be created. Even with the bending allowed by topology, the vicinity of the shared point looks like a \"+\", not a line. A \"+\" is not homeomorphic to a closed interval (line segment), since deleting the center point from the \"+\" gives a space with four components (i.e. pieces), whereas deleting a point from a closed interval gives a space with at most two pieces; topological operations always preserve the number of pieces.\n\nInformally, a manifold is a space that is \"modeled on\" Euclidean space.\n\nThere are many different kinds of manifolds, depending on the context. In geometry and topology, all manifolds are topological manifolds, possibly with additional structure, such as a differentiable structure. A manifold can be constructed by giving a collection of coordinate charts, that is a covering by open sets with homeomorphisms to a Euclidean space, and patching functions: homeomorphisms from one region of Euclidean space to another region if they correspond to the same part of the manifold in two different coordinate charts. A manifold can be given additional structure if the patching functions satisfy axioms beyond continuity. For instance, differentiable manifolds have homeomorphisms on overlapping neighborhoods diffeomorphic with each other, so that the manifold has a well-defined set of functions which are differentiable in each neighborhood, and so differentiable on the manifold as a whole.\n\nFormally, a (topological) manifold is a second countable Hausdorff space that is locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space.\n\n\"Second countable\" and \"Hausdorff\" are point-set conditions; \"second countable\" excludes spaces which are in some sense 'too large' such as the long line, while \"Hausdorff\" excludes spaces such as \"the line with two origins\" (these generalizations of manifolds are discussed in non-Hausdorff manifolds).\n\n\"Locally homeomorphic\" to Euclidean space means that every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open Euclidean \"n\"-ball,\n\nMore precisely, locally homeomorphic here means that each point \"m\" in the manifold \"M\" has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to an open \"neighborhood\" in Euclidean space, not to the unit ball specifically. However, given such a homeomorphism, the pre-image of an formula_18-ball gives a homeomorphism between the unit ball and a smaller neighborhood of \"m\", so this is no loss of generality. For topological or differentiable manifolds, one can also ask that every point have a neighborhood homeomorphic to all of Euclidean space (as this is diffeomorphic to the unit ball), but this cannot be done for complex manifolds, as the complex unit ball is not holomorphic to complex space.\n\nGenerally manifolds are taken to have a fixed dimension (the space must be locally homeomorphic to a fixed \"n\"-ball), and such a space is called an \"n\"-manifold; however, some authors admit manifolds where different points can have different dimensions. If a manifold has a fixed dimension, it is called a pure manifold. For example, the sphere has a constant dimension of 2 and is therefore a pure manifold whereas the disjoint union of a sphere and a line in three-dimensional space is \"not\" a pure manifold. Since dimension is a local invariant (i.e. the map sending each point to the dimension of its neighbourhood over which a chart is defined, is locally constant), each connected component has a fixed dimension.\n\nScheme-theoretically, a manifold is a locally ringed space, whose structure sheaf is locally isomorphic to the sheaf of continuous (or differentiable, or complex-analytic, etc.) functions on Euclidean space. This definition is mostly used when discussing analytic manifolds in algebraic geometry.\n\nThe spherical Earth is navigated using flat maps or charts, collected in an atlas. Similarly, a differentiable manifold can be described using mathematical maps, called \"coordinate charts\", collected in a mathematical \"atlas\". It is not generally possible to describe a manifold with just one chart, because the global structure of the manifold is different from the simple structure of the charts. For example, no single flat map can represent the entire Earth without separation of adjacent features across the map's boundaries or duplication of coverage. When a manifold is constructed from multiple overlapping charts, the regions where they overlap carry information essential to understanding the global structure.\n\nA \"coordinate map\", a \"coordinate chart\", or simply a \"chart\", of a manifold is an invertible map between a subset of the manifold and a simple space such that both the map and its inverse preserve the desired structure. For a topological manifold, the simple space is a subset of some Euclidean space R and interest focuses on the topological structure. This structure is preserved by homeomorphisms, invertible maps that are continuous in both directions.\n\nIn the case of a differentiable manifold, a set of \"charts\" called an \"atlas\" allows us to do calculus on manifolds. Polar coordinates, for example, form a chart for the plane R minus the positive \"x\"-axis and the origin. Another example of a chart is the map χ mentioned in the section above, a chart for the circle.\n\nThe description of most manifolds requires more than one chart (a single chart is adequate for only the simplest manifolds). A specific collection of charts which covers a manifold is called an \"atlas\". An atlas is not unique as all manifolds can be covered multiple ways using different combinations of charts. Two atlases are said to be equivalent if their union is also an atlas.\n\nThe atlas containing all possible charts consistent with a given atlas is called the \"maximal atlas\" (i.e. an equivalence class containing that given atlas (under the already defined equivalence relation given in the previous paragraph)). Unlike an ordinary atlas, the maximal atlas of a given manifold is unique. Though it is useful for definitions, it is an abstract object and not used directly (e.g. in calculations).\n\nCharts in an atlas may overlap and a single point of a manifold may be represented in several charts. If two charts overlap, parts of them represent the same region of the manifold, just as a map of Europe and a map of Asia may both contain Moscow. Given two overlapping charts, a \"transition function\" can be defined which goes from an open ball in R to the manifold and then back to another (or perhaps the same) open ball in R. The resultant map, like the map \"T\" in the circle example above, is called a \"change of coordinates\", a \"coordinate transformation\", a \"transition function\", or a \"transition map\".\n\nAn atlas can also be used to define additional structure on the manifold. The structure is first defined on each chart separately. If all the transition maps are compatible with this structure, the structure transfers to the manifold.\n\nThis is the standard way differentiable manifolds are defined. If the transition functions of an atlas for a topological manifold preserve the natural differential structure of R (that is, if they are diffeomorphisms), the differential structure transfers to the manifold and turns it into a differentiable manifold. Complex manifolds are introduced in an analogous way by requiring that the transition functions of an atlas are holomorphic functions. For symplectic manifolds, the transition functions must be symplectomorphisms.\n\nThe structure on the manifold depends on the atlas, but sometimes different atlases can be said to give rise to the same structure. Such atlases are called \"compatible\".\n\nThese notions are made precise in general through the use of pseudogroups.\n\nA manifold with boundary is a manifold with an edge. For example, a sheet of paper is a 2-manifold with a 1-dimensional boundary. The boundary of an \"n\"-manifold with boundary is an -manifold. A disk (circle plus interior) is a 2-manifold with boundary. Its boundary is a circle, a 1-manifold. A square with interior is also a 2-manifold with boundary. A ball (sphere plus interior) is a 3-manifold with boundary. Its boundary is a sphere, a 2-manifold. (See also Boundary (topology)).\n\nIn technical language, a manifold with boundary is a space containing both interior points and boundary points. Every interior point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to the open \"n\"-ball Every boundary point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to the \"half\" \"n\"-ball . The homeomorphism must send each boundary point to a point with \"x\" = 0.\n\nLet \"M\" be a manifold with boundary. The interior of \"M\", denoted Int \"M\", is the set of points in \"M\" which have neighborhoods homeomorphic to an open subset of R. The boundary of \"M\", denoted ∂\"M\", is the complement of Int\"M\" in \"M\". The boundary points can be characterized as those points which land on the boundary hyperplane of R under some coordinate chart.\n\nIf \"M\" is a manifold with boundary of dimension \"n\", then Int\"M\" is a manifold (without boundary) of dimension \"n\" and ∂\"M\" is a manifold (without boundary) of dimension .\n\nA single manifold can be constructed in different ways, each stressing a different aspect of the manifold, thereby leading to a slightly different viewpoint.\n\nPerhaps the simplest way to construct a manifold is the one used in the example above of the circle. First, a subset of R is identified, and then an atlas covering this subset is constructed. The concept of \"manifold\" grew historically from constructions like this. Here is another example, applying this method to the construction of a sphere:\n\nA sphere can be treated in almost the same way as the circle. In mathematics a sphere is just the surface (not the solid interior), which can be defined as a subset of R:\n\nThe sphere is two-dimensional, so each chart will map part of the sphere to an open subset of R. Consider the northern hemisphere, which is the part with positive \"z\" coordinate (coloured red in the picture on the right). The function χ defined by\n\nmaps the northern hemisphere to the open unit disc by projecting it on the (\"x\", \"y\") plane. A similar chart exists for the southern hemisphere. Together with two charts projecting on the (\"x\", \"z\") plane and two charts projecting on the (\"y\", \"z\") plane, an atlas of six charts is obtained which covers the entire sphere.\n\nThis can be easily generalized to higher-dimensional spheres.\n\nA manifold can be constructed by gluing together pieces in a consistent manner, making them into overlapping charts. This construction is possible for any manifold and hence it is often used as a characterisation, especially for differentiable and Riemannian manifolds. It focuses on an atlas, as the patches naturally provide charts, and since there is no exterior space involved it leads to an intrinsic view of the manifold.\n\nThe manifold is constructed by specifying an atlas, which is itself defined by transition maps. A point of the manifold is therefore an equivalence class of points which are mapped to each other by transition maps. Charts map equivalence classes to points of a single patch. There are usually strong demands on the consistency of the transition maps. For topological manifolds they are required to be homeomorphisms; if they are also diffeomorphisms, the resulting manifold is a differentiable manifold.\n\nThis can be illustrated with the transition map \"t\" = ⁄ from the second half of the circle example. Start with two copies of the line. Use the coordinate \"s\" for the first copy, and \"t\" for the second copy. Now, glue both copies together by identifying the point \"t\" on the second copy with the point \"s\" = ⁄ on the first copy (the points \"t\" = 0 and \"s\" = 0 are not identified with any point on the first and second copy, respectively). This gives a circle.\n\nThe first construction and this construction are very similar, but they represent rather different points of view. In the first construction, the manifold is seen as embedded in some Euclidean space. This is the \"extrinsic view\". When a manifold is viewed in this way, it is easy to use intuition from Euclidean spaces to define additional structure. For example, in a Euclidean space it is always clear whether a vector at some point is tangential or normal to some surface through that point.\n\nThe patchwork construction does not use any embedding, but simply views the manifold as a topological space by itself. This abstract point of view is called the \"intrinsic view\". It can make it harder to imagine what a tangent vector might be, and there is no intrinsic notion of a normal bundle, but instead there is an intrinsic stable normal bundle.\n\nThe \"n\"-sphere S is a generalisation of the idea of a circle (1-sphere) and sphere (2-sphere) to higher dimensions. An \"n\"-sphere S can be constructed by gluing together two copies of R. The transition map between them is defined as\n\nThis function is its own inverse and thus can be used in both directions. As the transition map is a smooth function, this atlas defines a smooth manifold.\nIn the case \"n\" = 1, the example simplifies to the circle example given earlier.\n\nIt is possible to define different points of a manifold to be same. This can be visualized as gluing these points together in a single point, forming a quotient space. There is, however, no reason to expect such quotient spaces to be manifolds. Among the possible quotient spaces that are not necessarily manifolds, orbifolds and CW complexes are considered to be relatively well-behaved. An example of a quotient space of a manifold that is also a manifold is the real projective space identified as a quotient space of the corresponding sphere.\n\nOne method of identifying points (gluing them together) is through a right (or left) action of a group, which acts on the manifold. Two points are identified if one is moved onto the other by some group element. If \"M\" is the manifold and \"G\" is the group, the resulting quotient space is denoted by \"M\" / \"G\" (or \"G\" \\ \"M\").\n\nManifolds which can be constructed by identifying points include tori and real projective spaces (starting with a plane and a sphere, respectively).\n\nTwo manifolds with boundaries can be glued together along a boundary. If this is done the right way, the result is also a manifold. Similarly, two boundaries of a single manifold can be glued together.\n\nFormally, the gluing is defined by a bijection between the two boundaries. Two points are identified when they are mapped onto each other. For a topological manifold this bijection should be a homeomorphism, otherwise the result will not be a topological manifold. Similarly for a differentiable manifold it has to be a diffeomorphism. For other manifolds other structures should be preserved.\n\nA finite cylinder may be constructed as a manifold by starting with a strip [0, 1] × [0, 1] and gluing a pair of opposite edges on the boundary by a suitable diffeomorphism. A projective plane may be obtained by gluing a sphere with a hole in it to a Möbius strip along their respective circular boundaries.\n\nThe Cartesian product of manifolds is also a manifold.\n\nThe dimension of the product manifold is the sum of the dimensions of its factors. Its topology is the product topology, and a Cartesian product of charts is a chart for the product manifold. Thus, an atlas for the product manifold can be constructed using atlases for its factors. If these atlases define a differential structure on the factors, the corresponding atlas defines a differential structure on the product manifold. The same is true for any other structure defined on the factors. If one of the factors has a boundary, the product manifold also has a boundary. Cartesian products may be used to construct tori and finite cylinders, for example, as S × S and S × [0, 1], respectively.\nThe study of manifolds combines many important areas of mathematics: it generalizes concepts such as curves and surfaces as well as ideas from linear algebra and topology.\n\nBefore the modern concept of a manifold there were several important results.\n\nNon-Euclidean geometry considers spaces where Euclid's parallel postulate fails. Saccheri first studied such geometries in 1733 but sought only to disprove them. Gauss, Bolyai and Lobachevsky independently discovered them 100 years later. Their research uncovered two types of spaces whose geometric structures differ from that of classical Euclidean space; these gave rise to hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry. In the modern theory of manifolds, these notions correspond to Riemannian manifolds with constant negative and positive curvature, respectively.\n\nCarl Friedrich Gauss may have been the first to consider abstract spaces as mathematical objects in their own right. His theorema egregium gives a method for computing the curvature of a surface without considering the ambient space in which the surface lies. Such a surface would, in modern terminology, be called a manifold; and in modern terms, the theorem proved that the curvature of the surface is an intrinsic property. Manifold theory has come to focus exclusively on these intrinsic properties (or invariants), while largely ignoring the extrinsic properties of the ambient space.\n\nAnother, more topological example of an intrinsic property of a manifold is its Euler characteristic. Leonhard Euler showed that for a convex polytope in the three-dimensional Euclidean space with \"V\" vertices (or corners), \"E\" edges, and \"F\" faces,\n\nThe same formula will hold if we project the vertices and edges of the polytope onto a sphere, creating a topological map with \"V\" vertices, \"E\" edges, and \"F\" faces, and in fact, will remain true for any spherical map, even if it does not arise from any convex polytope. Thus 2 is a topological invariant of the sphere, called its Euler characteristic. On the other hand, a torus can be sliced open by its 'parallel' and 'meridian' circles, creating a map with \"V\" = 1 vertex, \"E\" = 2 edges, and \"F\" = 1 face. Thus the Euler characteristic of the torus is 1 − 2 + 1 = 0. The Euler characteristic of other surfaces is a useful topological invariant, which can be extended to higher dimensions using Betti numbers. In the mid nineteenth century, the Gauss–Bonnet theorem linked the Euler characteristic to the Gaussian curvature.\n\nInvestigations of Niels Henrik Abel and Carl Gustav Jacobi on inversion of elliptic integrals in the first half of 19th century led them to consider special types of complex manifolds, now known as Jacobians. Bernhard Riemann further contributed to their theory, clarifying the geometric meaning of the process of analytic continuation of functions of complex variables.\n\nAnother important source of manifolds in 19th century mathematics was analytical mechanics, as developed by Siméon Poisson, Jacobi, and William Rowan Hamilton. The possible states of a mechanical system are thought to be points of an abstract space, phase space in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms of classical mechanics. This space is, in fact, a high-dimensional manifold, whose dimension corresponds to the degrees of freedom of the system and where the points are specified by their generalized coordinates. For an unconstrained movement of free particles the manifold is equivalent to the Euclidean space, but various conservation laws constrain it to more complicated formations, e.g. Liouville tori. The theory of a rotating solid body, developed in the 18th century by Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange, gives another example where the manifold is nontrivial. Geometrical and topological aspects of classical mechanics were emphasized by Henri Poincaré, one of the founders of topology.\n\nRiemann was the first one to do extensive work generalizing the idea of a surface to higher dimensions. The name \"manifold\" comes from Riemann's original German term, \"Mannigfaltigkeit\", which William Kingdon Clifford translated as \"manifoldness\". In his Göttingen inaugural lecture, Riemann described the set of all possible values of a variable with certain constraints as a \"Mannigfaltigkeit\", because the variable can have \"many\" values. He distinguishes between \"stetige Mannigfaltigkeit\" and \"diskrete\" \"Mannigfaltigkeit\" (\"continuous manifoldness\" and \"discontinuous manifoldness\"), depending on whether the value changes continuously or not. As continuous examples, Riemann refers to not only colors and the locations of objects in space, but also the possible shapes of a spatial figure. Using induction, Riemann constructs an \"n-fach ausgedehnte Mannigfaltigkeit\" (\"n times extended manifoldness\" or \"n-dimensional manifoldness\") as a continuous stack of (n−1) dimensional manifoldnesses. Riemann's intuitive notion of a \"Mannigfaltigkeit\" evolved into what is today formalized as a manifold. Riemannian manifolds and Riemann surfaces are named after Riemann.\n\nIn his very influential paper, Analysis Situs, Henri Poincaré gave a definition of a (differentiable) manifold (\"variété\") which served as a precursor to the modern concept of a manifold.\n\nIn the first section of Analysis Situs, Poincaré defines a manifold as the level set of a continuously differentiable function between Euclidean spaces that satisfies the nondegeneracy hypothesis of the implicit function theorem. In the third section, he begins by remarking that the graph of a continuously differentiable function is a manifold in the latter sense. He then proposes a new, more general, definition of manifold based on a 'chain of manifolds' (\"une chaîne des variétés\").\n\nPoincaré's notion of a \"chain of manifolds\" is a precursor to the modern notion of atlas. In particular, he considers two manifolds defined respectively as graphs of functions formula_23 and formula_24. If these manifolds overlap (\"a une partie commune\"), then he requires that the coordinates formula_25 depend continuously differentiably on the coordinates formula_26 and vice versa ('\"...les formula_27 sont fonctions analytiques des formula_28 et inversement\"'). In this way he introduces a precursor to the notion of a chart and of a transition map. It is implicit in Analysis Situs that a manifold obtained as a 'chain' is a subset of Euclidean space.\n\nFor example, the unit circle in the plane can be thought of as the graph of the function formula_29 or else the function formula_30 in a neighborhood of every point except the points (1, 0) and (−1, 0); and in a neighborhood of those points, it can be thought of as the graph of, respectively, formula_31 and formula_32. The reason the circle can be represented by a graph in the neighborhood of every point is because the left hand side of its defining equation formula_33 has nonzero gradient at every point of the circle. By the implicit function theorem, every submanifold of Euclidean space is locally the graph of a function.\n\nHermann Weyl gave an intrinsic definition for differentiable manifolds in his lecture course on Riemann surfaces in 1911–1912, opening the road to the general concept of a topological space that followed shortly. During the 1930s Hassler Whitney and others clarified the foundational aspects of the subject, and thus intuitions dating back to the latter half of the 19th century became precise, and developed through differential geometry and Lie group theory. Notably, the Whitney embedding theorem showed that the intrinsic definition in terms of charts was equivalent to Poincaré's definition in terms of subsets of Euclidean space.\n\nTwo-dimensional manifolds, also known as a 2D \"surfaces\" embedded in our common 3D space, were considered by Riemann under the guise of Riemann surfaces, and rigorously classified in the beginning of the 20th century by Poul Heegaard and Max Dehn. Henri Poincaré pioneered the study of three-dimensional manifolds and raised a fundamental question about them, today known as the Poincaré conjecture. After nearly a century of effort by many mathematicians, starting with Poincaré himself, Grigori Perelman proved the Poincaré conjecture (see the Solution of the Poincaré conjecture). William Thurston's geometrization program, formulated in the 1970s, provided a far-reaching extension of the Poincaré conjecture to the general three-dimensional manifolds. Four-dimensional manifolds were brought to the forefront of mathematical research in the 1980s by Michael Freedman and in a different setting, by Simon Donaldson, who was motivated by the then recent progress in theoretical physics (Yang–Mills theory), where they serve as a substitute for ordinary 'flat' spacetime. Andrey Markov Jr. showed in 1960 that no algorithm exists for classifying four-dimensional manifolds. Important work on higher-dimensional manifolds, including analogues of the Poincaré conjecture, had been done earlier by René Thom, John Milnor, Stephen Smale and Sergei Novikov. One of the most pervasive and flexible techniques underlying much work on the topology of manifolds is Morse theory.\n\nThe simplest kind of manifold to define is the topological manifold, which looks locally like some \"ordinary\" Euclidean space R. By definition, all manifolds are topological manifolds, so the phrase \"topological manifold\" is usually used to emphasize that a manifold lacks additional structure, or that only its topological properties are being considered. Formally, a topological manifold is a topological space locally homeomorphic to a Euclidean space. This means that every point has a neighbourhood for which there exists a homeomorphism (a bijective continuous function whose inverse is also continuous) mapping that neighbourhood to R. These homeomorphisms are the charts of the manifold.\n\nA \"topological\" manifold looks locally like a Euclidean space in a rather weak manner: while for each individual chart it is possible to distinguish differentiable functions or measure distances and angles, merely by virtue of being a topological manifold a space does not have any \"particular\" and \"consistent\" choice of such concepts. In order to discuss such properties for a manifold, one needs to specify further structure and consider differentiable manifolds and Riemannian manifolds discussed below. In particular, the same underlying topological manifold can have several mutually incompatible classes of differentiable functions and an infinite number of ways to specify distances and angles.\n\nUsually additional technical assumptions on the topological space are made to exclude pathological cases. It is customary to require that the space be Hausdorff and second countable.\n\nThe \"dimension\" of the manifold at a certain point is the dimension of the Euclidean space that the charts at that point map to (number \"n\" in the definition). All points in a connected manifold have the same dimension. Some authors require that all charts of a topological manifold map to Euclidean spaces of same dimension. In that case every topological manifold has a topological invariant, its dimension. Other authors allow disjoint unions of topological manifolds with differing dimensions to be called manifolds.\n\nFor most applications a special kind of topological manifold, namely a differentiable manifold, is used. If the local charts on a manifold are compatible in a certain sense, one can define directions, tangent spaces, and differentiable functions on that manifold. In particular it is possible to use calculus on a differentiable manifold. Each point of an \"n\"-dimensional differentiable manifold has a tangent space. This is an \"n\"-dimensional Euclidean space consisting of the tangent vectors of the curves through the point.\n\nTwo important classes of differentiable manifolds are smooth and analytic manifolds. For smooth manifolds the transition maps are smooth, that is infinitely differentiable. Analytic manifolds are smooth manifolds with the additional condition that the transition maps are analytic (they can be expressed as power series). The sphere can be given analytic structure, as can most familiar curves and surfaces.\n\nThere are also topological manifolds, i.e., locally Euclidean spaces, which possess no differentiable structures at all.\n\nA rectifiable set generalizes the idea of a piecewise smooth or rectifiable curve to higher dimensions; however, rectifiable sets are not in general manifolds.\n\nTo measure distances and angles on manifolds, the manifold must be Riemannian. A \"Riemannian manifold\" is a differentiable manifold in which each tangent space is equipped with an inner product in a manner which varies smoothly from point to point. Given two tangent vectors and , the inner product gives a real number. The dot (or scalar) product is a typical example of an inner product. This allows one to define various notions such as length, angles, areas (or volumes), curvature and divergence of vector fields.\n\nAll differentiable manifolds (of constant dimension) can be given the structure of a Riemannian manifold. The Euclidean space itself carries a natural structure of Riemannian manifold (the tangent spaces are naturally identified with the Euclidean space itself and carry the standard scalar product of the space). Many familiar curves and surfaces, including for example all -spheres, are specified as subspaces of a Euclidean space and inherit a metric from their embedding in it.\n\nA Finsler manifold allows the definition of distance but does not require the concept of angle; it is an analytic manifold in which each tangent space is equipped with a norm, ||·||, in a manner which varies smoothly from point to point. This norm can be extended to a metric, defining the length of a curve; but it cannot in general be used to define an inner product.\n\nAny Riemannian manifold is a Finsler manifold.\n\nLie groups, named after Sophus Lie, are differentiable manifolds that carry also the structure of a group which is such that the group operations are defined by smooth maps.\n\nA Euclidean vector space with the group operation of vector addition is an example of a non-compact Lie group. A simple example of a compact Lie group is the circle: the group operation is simply rotation. This group, known as U(1), can be also characterised as the group of complex numbers of modulus 1 with multiplication as the group operation.\n\nOther examples of Lie groups include special groups of matrices, which are all subgroups of the general linear group, the group of \"n\" by \"n\" matrices with non-zero determinant. If the matrix entries are real numbers, this will be an \"n\"-dimensional disconnected manifold. The orthogonal groups, the symmetry groups of the sphere and hyperspheres, are \"n\"(\"n\"−1)/2 dimensional manifolds, where \"n\"−1 is the dimension of the sphere. Further examples can be found in the table of Lie groups.\n\n\nDifferent notions of manifolds have different notions of classification and invariant; in this section we focus on smooth closed manifolds.\n\nThe classification of smooth closed manifolds is well understood \"in principle\", except in dimension 4: in low dimensions (2 and 3) it is geometric, via the uniformization theorem and the solution of the Poincaré conjecture, and in high dimension (5 and above) it is algebraic, via surgery theory. This is a classification in principle: the general question of whether two smooth manifolds are diffeomorphic is not computable in general. Further, specific computations remain difficult, and there are many open questions.\n\nOrientable surfaces can be visualized, and their diffeomorphism classes enumerated, by genus. Given two orientable surfaces, one can determine if they are diffeomorphic by computing their respective genera and comparing: they are diffeomorphic if and only if the genera are equal, so the genus forms a complete set of invariants.\n\nThis is much harder in higher dimensions: higher-dimensional manifolds cannot be directly visualized (though visual intuition is useful in understanding them), nor can their diffeomorphism classes be enumerated, nor can one in general determine if two different descriptions of a higher-dimensional manifold refer to the same object.\n\nHowever, one can determine if two manifolds are \"different\" if there is some intrinsic characteristic that differentiates them. Such criteria are commonly referred to as invariants, because, while they may be defined in terms of some presentation (such as the genus in terms of a triangulation), they are the same relative to all possible descriptions of a particular manifold: they are \"invariant\" under different descriptions.\n\nNaively, one could hope to develop an arsenal of invariant criteria that would definitively classify all manifolds up to isomorphism.\nUnfortunately, it is known that for manifolds of dimension 4 and higher, no program exists that can decide whether two manifolds are diffeomorphic.\n\nSmooth manifolds have a rich set of invariants, coming from point-set topology,\nclassic algebraic topology, and geometric topology. The most familiar invariants, which are visible for surfaces, are orientability (a normal invariant, also detected by homology) and genus (a homological invariant).\n\nSmooth closed manifolds have no local invariants (other than dimension), though geometric manifolds have local invariants, notably the curvature of a Riemannian manifold and the torsion of a manifold equipped with an affine connection.\nThis distinction between local invariants and no local invariants is a common way to distinguish between geometry and topology. All invariants of a smooth closed manifold are thus global.\n\nAlgebraic topology is a source of a number of important global invariant properties. Some key criteria include the \"simply connected\" property and orientability (see below). Indeed, several branches of mathematics, such as homology and homotopy theory, and the theory of characteristic classes were founded in order to study invariant properties of manifolds.\n\nIn dimensions two and higher, a simple but important invariant criterion is the question of whether a manifold admits a meaningful orientation. Consider a topological manifold with charts mapping to R. Given an ordered basis for R, a chart causes its piece of the manifold to itself acquire a sense of ordering, which in 3-dimensions can be viewed as either right-handed or left-handed. Overlapping charts are not required to agree in their sense of ordering, which gives manifolds an important freedom. For some manifolds, like the sphere, charts can be chosen so that overlapping regions agree on their \"handedness\"; these are \"orientable\" manifolds. For others, this is impossible. The latter possibility is easy to overlook, because any closed surface embedded (without self-intersection) in three-dimensional space is orientable.\n\nSome illustrative examples of non-orientable manifolds include: (1) the Möbius strip, which is a manifold with boundary, (2) the Klein bottle, which must intersect itself in its 3-space representation, and (3) the real projective plane, which arises naturally in geometry. \n\nBegin with an infinite circular cylinder standing vertically, a manifold without boundary. Slice across it high and low to produce two circular boundaries, and the cylindrical strip between them. This is an orientable manifold with boundary, upon which \"surgery\" will be performed. Slice the strip open, so that it could unroll to become a rectangle, but keep a grasp on the cut ends. Twist one end 180°, making the inner surface face out, and glue the ends back together seamlessly. This results in a strip with a permanent half-twist: the Möbius strip. Its boundary is no longer a pair of circles, but (topologically) a single circle; and what was once its \"inside\" has merged with its \"outside\", so that it now has only a \"single\" side. Similarly to the Klein Bottle below, this two dimensional surface would need to intersect itself in two dimensions, but can easily be constructed in three or more dimensions.\n\nTake two Möbius strips; each has a single loop as a boundary. Straighten out those loops into circles, and let the strips distort into cross-caps. Gluing the circles together will produce a new, closed manifold without boundary, the Klein bottle. Closing the surface does nothing to improve the lack of orientability, it merely removes the boundary. Thus, the Klein bottle is a closed surface with no distinction between inside and outside. In three-dimensional space, a Klein bottle's surface must pass through itself. Building a Klein bottle which is not self-intersecting requires four or more dimensions of space.\n\nBegin with a sphere centered on the origin. Every line through the origin pierces the sphere in two opposite points called \"antipodes\". Although there is no way to do so physically, it is possible (by considering a quotient space) to mathematically merge each antipode pair into a single point. The closed surface so produced is the real projective plane, yet another non-orientable surface. It has a number of equivalent descriptions and constructions, but this route explains its name: all the points on any given line through the origin project to the same \"point\" on this \"plane\".\n\nFor two dimensional manifolds a key invariant property is the genus, or the \"number of handles\" present in a surface. A torus is a sphere with one handle, a double torus is a sphere with two handles, and so on. Indeed, it is possible to fully characterize compact, two-dimensional manifolds on the basis of genus and orientability. In higher-dimensional manifolds genus is replaced by the notion of Euler characteristic, and more generally Betti numbers and homology and cohomology.\n\nJust as there are various types of manifolds, there are various types of maps of manifolds. In addition to continuous functions and smooth functions generally, there are maps with special properties. In geometric topology a basic type are embeddings, of which knot theory is a central example, and generalizations such as immersions, submersions, covering spaces, and ramified covering spaces.\nBasic results include the Whitney embedding theorem and Whitney immersion theorem.\n\nIn Riemannian geometry, one may ask for maps to preserve the Riemannian metric, leading to notions of isometric embeddings, isometric immersions, and Riemannian submersions; a basic result is the Nash embedding theorem.\n\nA basic example of maps between manifolds are scalar-valued functions on a manifold,\n\nsometimes called regular functions or functionals, by analogy with algebraic geometry or linear algebra. These are of interest both in their own right, and to study the underlying manifold.\n\nIn geometric topology, most commonly studied are Morse functions, which yield handlebody decompositions, while in mathematical analysis, one often studies solution to partial differential equations, an important example of which is harmonic analysis, where one studies harmonic functions: the kernel of the Laplace operator. This leads to such functions as the spherical harmonics, and to heat kernel methods of studying manifolds, such as hearing the shape of a drum and some proofs of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2073471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073471", "title": "Beta oxidation", "text": "Beta oxidation\n\nIn biochemistry and metabolism, beta-oxidation is the catabolic process by which fatty acid molecules are broken down in the cytosol in prokaryotes and in the mitochondria in eukaryotes to generate acetyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle, and NADH and FADH, which are co-enzymes used in the electron transport chain. It is named as such because the beta carbon of the fatty acid undergoes oxidation to a carbonyl group. Beta-oxidation is primarily facilitated by the mitochondrial trifunctional protein, an enzyme complex associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane, although very long chain fatty acids are oxidized in peroxisomes.\n\nThe overall reaction for one cycle of beta oxidation is:\n\nFree fatty acids cannot penetrate any biological membrane due to their negative charge. Free fatty acids must cross the cell membrane through specific transport proteins, such as the SLC27 family fatty acid transport protein. Once in the cytosol, the following processes bring fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix so that beta-oxidation can take place.\n\nOnce the fatty acid is inside the mitochondrial matrix, beta-oxidation occurs by cleaving two carbons every cycle to form acetyl-CoA. The process consists of 4 steps.\n\n\nFatty acids are oxidized by most of the tissues in the body. However, some tissues such as the red blood cells of mammals (which do not contain mitochondria), and cells of the central nervous system do not use fatty acids for their energy requirements, but instead use carbohydrates (red blood cells and neurons) or ketone bodies (neurons only).\n\nBecause many fatty acids are not fully saturated or do not have an even number of carbons, several different mechanisms have evolved, described below.\n\nOnce inside the mitochondria, each cycle of β-oxidation, liberating a two carbon unit (acetyl-CoA), occurs in a sequence of four reactions:\n\nThis process continues until the entire chain is cleaved into acetyl CoA units. The final cycle produces two separate acetyl CoAs, instead of one acyl CoA and one acetyl CoA. For every cycle, the Acyl CoA unit is shortened by two carbon atoms. Concomitantly, one molecule of FADH, NADH and acetyl CoA are formed.\n\nIn general, fatty acids with an odd number of carbons are found in the lipids of plants and some marine organisms. Many ruminant animals form a large amount of 3-carbon propionate during the fermentation of carbohydrates in the rumen. Long-chain fatty acids with an odd number of carbon atoms are found particularly in ruminant fat and milk.\n\nChains with an odd-number of carbons are oxidized in the same manner as even-numbered chains, but the final products are propionyl-CoA and Acetyl CoA\n\nPropionyl-CoA is first carboxylated using a bicarbonate ion into D-stereoisomer of methylmalonyl-CoA, in a reaction that involves a biotin co-factor, ATP, and the enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase. The bicarbonate ion's carbon is added to the middle carbon of propionyl-CoA, forming a D-methylmalonyl-CoA. However, the D conformation is enzymatically converted into the L conformation by methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase, then it undergoes intramolecular rearrangement, which is catalyzed by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (requiring B as a coenzyme) to form succinyl-CoA. The succinyl-CoA formed can then enter the citric acid cycle.\n\nHowever, whereas acetyl-CoA enters the citric acid cycle by condensing with an existing molecule of oxaloacetate, succinyl-CoA enters the cycle as a principal in its own right. Thus the succinate just adds to the population of circulating molecules in the cycle and undergoes no net metabolization while in it. When this infusion of citric acid cycle intermediates exceeds cataplerotic demand (such as for aspartate or glutamate synthesis), some of them can be extracted to the gluconeogenesis pathway, in the liver and kidneys, through phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and converted to free glucose.\n\nβ-Oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids poses a problem since the location of a cis bond can prevent the formation of a trans-Δ bond. These situations are handled by an additional two enzymes, Enoyl CoA isomerase or 2,4 Dienoyl CoA reductase.\n\nWhatever the conformation of the hydrocarbon chain, β-oxidation occurs normally until the acyl CoA (because of the presence of a double bond) is not an appropriate substrate for acyl CoA dehydrogenase, or enoyl CoA hydratase:\n\n\nTo summarize:\n\nFatty acid oxidation also occurs in peroxisomes when the fatty acid chains are too long to be handled by the mitochondria. The same enzymes are used in peroxisomes as in the mitochondrial matrix, and acetyl-CoA is generated. It is believed that very long chain (greater than C-22) fatty acids, branched fatty acids, some prostaglandins and leukotrienes undergo initial oxidation in peroxisomes until octanoyl-CoA is formed, at which point it undergoes mitochondrial oxidation.\n\nOne significant difference is that oxidation in peroxisomes is not coupled to ATP synthesis. Instead, the high-potential electrons are transferred to O, which yields HO. It does generate heat however. The enzyme catalase, found primarily in peroxisomes and the cytosol of erythrocytes (and sometimes in mitochondria), converts the hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.\n\nPeroxisomal β-oxidation also requires enzymes specific to the peroxisome and to very long fatty acids. There are four key differences between the enzymes used for mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation:\n\nPeroxisomal oxidation is induced by a high-fat diet and administration of hypolipidemic drugs like clofibrate.\n\nThe ATP yield for every oxidation cycle is theoretically a maximum yield of 17, as NADH produces 3 ATP, FADH produces 2 ATP and a full rotation of the citric acid cycle produces 12 ATP. In practice it is closer to 14 ATP for a full oxidation cycle as the theoretical yield is not attained - it is generally closer to 2.5 ATP per NADH molecule produced, 1.5 ATP for each FADH molecule produced and this equates to 10 ATP per cycle of the TCA (according to the P/O ratio), broken down as follows:\n\nFor an even-numbered saturated fat (C), n - 1 oxidations are necessary, and the final process yields an additional acetyl CoA. In addition, two equivalents of ATP are lost during the activation of the fatty acid. Therefore, the total ATP yield can be stated as:\n\nor\nFor instance, the ATP yield of palmitate (C, \"n = 8\") is:\n\nRepresented in table form:\n\nFor sources that use the larger ATP production numbers described above, the total would be 129 ATP ={(8-1)*17+12-2} equivalents per palmitate.\n\nBeta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids changes the ATP yield due to the requirement of two possible additional enzymes.\n\nThe reactions of beta oxidation and part of citric acid cycle present structural similarities in three of four reactions of the beta oxidation: the oxidation by FAD, the hydration, and the oxidation by NAD. Each enzyme of these metabolic pathways presents structural similarity.\n\nThere are at least 25 enzymes and specific transport proteins in the β-oxidation pathway. Of these, 18 have been associated with human disease as inborn errors of metabolism.\n\n\n"}

He is paid huge amounts of money for his views, consulted by the government, but he is bored and wants adventure, so he joins the shadowy organization The Council which controls everything going on in the world. Starring alongside Mayall is Michael Maloney as Brian Albumen, Cnut's faithful servant, and Emily Bruni as Dr. Hannah Awkward who becomes professor of pedantics.\n\nThe series was written by Maurice Gran and Laurence Marks. Although much hyped by ITV, who were hoping to repeat the success of Gran and Marks' previous project with Mayall, \"The New Statesman\", the series did not achieve high viewing figures, and was dropped after one series.\n\nIn Get Rich Quick, Adonis Cnut meets the attractive Hannah Awkward, who is trying to get a professorship. However, Adonis had already voted against her before he had met her, and since he cannot change his vote, Dr. Awkward will not become professor. The only way is for her to marry Adonis, since one is not allowed to vote against one's own wife. Then Albumen wins 50 million pounds on a TV show, with Adonis giving him the answers through a headset, which is part of a scheme to make people think that genetically modified food makes you very smart. Albumen is made honorary member of the university senate, and gives Dr. Awkward his vote, so she does not have to marry Adonis. Adonis, however, is not very pleased about this.\n\nIn Prepare to Meteor Maker, Sir Richard Chutney announces to the secret council that planet earth will soon collide with a meteor. All the members of the council decide to pretend they are having a charity high-altitude balloon race, while they are actually escaping armageddon. Meanwhile, Albumen is about to be arrested, because The Sun is threatening to release an article about his treason during the Falklands War. Adonis Cnut takes Hannah and Albumen with him in his balloon, looking forward to having to repopulate the world together with Hannah. When he tries to shoot an albatross, Adonis actually hits Richard Chutney's balloon, and Chutney seems to land on their balcony. The man then turns out to be called Graeme, and Chutney is apparently still on the ground, having lied about the meteor, and is now buying all the world's major companies (including Microsoft) for very reasonable prices. Luckily, while Chutney is busy becoming the owner of the planet, Adonis \"drops in unannounced\" and manages to depress Chutney so much (by telling him there are no challenges left for him in life) that it drives him to jump out of the window. Adonis buys The Sun and prevents Albumen's arrest.\n\nIn Might as Well Face It, You're Addicted to Fudge, dr. Awkward is rapidly gaining weight due to her addiction to Albumen's home-made fudge. Unfortunately, Albumen has been illegally selling his confectionery on the Magdalen Bridge (in British imperial units), and all the fudge has been confiscated by the police as evidence. Albumen is very defensive of the old imperial measures and calls himself a \"metric martyr\". Meanwhile, the secret council is in need of an offshore island to control, and Cuba seems to be a good option. Adonis disguises himself as Cuban exile Señor Guacamole and visits the somewhat dimwitted US president George W. Shrub, in order to make him believe he has to invade Cuba. He succeeds, and visits UK prime minister Tony Caring while he is at it, also persuading him he has to declare war on Cuba, but also to leave the European Union and reinstate the old British imperial measures. Meanwhile, Hannah has broken into the police station and eaten the 17 kilos worth of fudge they had confiscated as evidence. Both she and Albumen are arrested by Constable Haywain. However, the council has found out that Cuba is no longer an option, because it will be hit by a tidal wave. Adonis returns to America and persuades president Shrub (\"Call me Dubya!\") by means of a special cigar to reconsider declaring war. He explains to the council that, now that Britain has left the European Union, it will be available as their own exploitable offshore island. Albumen receives a pardon from the prime minister in a foolscap envelope, on quarto parchment, handwritten with ink made from soot and cold tea.\n\nIn Double First, Adonis Cnut is suspected of murdering Burger King Professor Sheridan Brinsley in a pub toilet after having appeared on a talk show with him. Adonis denies he has killed Brinsley, but is clearly being secretive about something. One afternoon, when he is normally lecturing, Dr. Awkward accidentally meets Adonis in his office and he starts kissing her. However, when Hannah starts \"scrabbling at his trousers like a deranged dormouse\", Adonis stops her and tells her he's impotent. When she tells Albumen about this, he knows something must be wrong, and when they ask Adonis whether he would like to go to a sex therapist, he reveals what has really been going on. As it turns out, Adonis has been mapping human DNA in his secret laboratory for the last few years, and has already started cloning people as well, namely Albumen (a spare one, in case something happens to the original) and himself. Adonis's clone has evidently murdered Sheridan Brinsley, but when the clone comes over to the apartment, no one can tell who is the real Adonis. The real Adonis then tells the police inspector about a microdot he put between the buttocks of his clone in order to tell them apart. This turns out to be a bluff, but it becomes clear that the clone has no genitals (as Adonis puts it: \"teflon groin\") which is convincing enough. The clone is arrested and Adonis goes free.\n\nIn The Unhappy Eater, the now Nobel Prize winner Adonis Cnut is sent on a mission to find the formula to an antidepressant. The formula already exists, but has been hidden somewhere. The person who hid it is Edmund Bilyas, a professor who shares quite a few characteristics with Hannibal Lecter, who is now in prison because he ate 11 of his students. Adonis and Albumen visit him in prison to offer him things (such as \"edible cellmates\") in exchange for the whereabouts of the formula. Bilyas does not accept their offers, but lets Adonis work the problem out by himself. Albumen suggests the location will have something to do with cannibalism, after which dr. Awkward suddenly remembers an exhibition she went to around the time Bilyas was arrested, about a cannibal Aztec king called Quecalaxlotlotl. They find out that the exhibition is currently in Belugastan. They go to Belugastan and trick one of the museum guards into turning the alarm system off. Adonis finds the formula inside a skull and when they come home, he tests the drug on Albumen and on Hannah, who is immediately off to Hollywood (because she is suddenly so happy about her looks) to star together with Anthony Hopkins in \"Muteness of the Goats III: The Revenge of Billy\". Adonis uses the antidepressant on the prime minister, who would not let him have a statue of himself made. Due to the drug, the prime minister says a few rather stupid things during a TV interview and is fired. The new prime minister thanks him by means of giving him a huge statue of himself with golden angel wings (\"visible from space\") in front of Buckingham Palace.\n\nIn Just a Minute, Adonis Cnut has just finished making the pilot for his new TV series called A Long History of Time, \"not to be confused with Stephen Hawking's superficial treatment of the same subject\". Unfortunately, the people at the BBC do not think the man in the street will appreciate his programme, so it will be aired at 3 a.m. on \"BBC Digital Choice Gold Two\". Adonis tells Albumen, who is apparently not feeling too well, to tape the programme. However, when Adonis watches the tape the next day, the last minute before the end has been cut off and instead there is a \"film about Watergate\" that was already on the tape. He confronts Albumen with the missing minute of his programme and accuses him of deliberately setting the VCR so that it would stop a minute before the end. Albumen replies that, funnily enough, \"all VCR's do that\". Hannah arrives and she tells Adonis to phone a doctor, because Albumen is literally green in the face and obviously ill. Doctor Clarence Newell-Post (a former lover of Vincent Awkward, Hannah's father) arranges a bed for Albumen at the hospital. Meanwhile, the secret council are struggling with the economic problems surrounding the phenomenon of global warming. Albumen is released from hospital and is diagnosed with radiation sickness. Adonis lets him watch his tape to make him feel better, and it turns out that the Watergate film on the tape is actual footage from the White House. Albumen explains that his father worked there as a janitor during Watergate, and that he stole the VCR and the tape in it from the White House. On the tape, there is evidence that Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger came up with a plan to manipulate all new digital watches from China to make every hour 30 seconds longer. Like this, they could get rid of the \"incriminating 18 minutes\" of the Watergate scandal. Adonis figures out that this is the key to global warming: \"because it is 30 years since Watergate, the calendar is three months adrift, so the fact that it feels like April in January, is because it actually \"is\" April in January\". This means there is no global warming and that everyone can just \"carry on polluting\". Kissinger, who is now in the secret council, warns Adonis about the VCR: it was a gift from the Chinese, who had stuffed it with plutonium to try to kill the president. Adonis runs over to his apartment, where Albumen and Hannah are now both green and ill, and throws the VCR out of the window, after which it explodes and Believe Nothing ends with Adonis's words \"Oh, bugger\".\n\nThe complete series has been released in both the UK (from Fremantle Home Entertainment) and Australia (through Shock DVD) as a region free DVD. The DVD features extras including one-on-one interviews with the series writer and regular cast and bloopers. Although the series was produced in 16:9 widescreen the DVD contains a 4:3 crop of all the episodes. Oddly, though, bloopers are presented in their original aspect ratio of 16:9.\n\n"}

At this time, the fleet consisted of a Douglas DC-8-63, a Douglas DC-8-50F and three Twin Otters. It operated international routes to Amsterdam, Belem, Curacao, Georgetown, Manaus, Miami and Panama City, and domestic services to Apoera, Avanavero, Bakhuys, Djoemoe, Ladouanie, Moengo and Nieuw Nickerie. From 1955 til 2005 Surinam Airways operated an extensive domestic network. Now, since 2013 Caricom Airways is operating as a feeder commuter airline from the hinterland of Suriname, using two Britten Norman BN2 Islanders and a Cessna 206, as \"Surinam Airways Commuter\".

It is the longest-running professional Equity theatre in the United States.\n\nIn 1933, when the United States was in the middle of the Great Depression, many people could not afford to pay for theater tickets, and many actors had trouble finding employment. A review by Paul Dellinger in the December 17, 2006 issue of \"The Roanoke Times\" summarized the situation as follows: But Broadway was not doing so much swinging during the Depression, when theaters went dark and actors found themselves out of work. Back in Porterfield's part of Virginia, farmers were stuck with crops they couldn't sell. That was when Porterfield came up with his genius of an idea, bringing actors to Abingdon to barter their performances for farm goods.\n\nBeginning with \"some twenty of his fellow actors\", Robert Porterfield, founder of the theatre, offered admission by letting the local people pay with food goods, hence the name \"Barter\". He said, \"With vegetables that you cannot sell you can buy a good laugh.\"\n\nThe original ticket price for a play was 30 cents, or the equivalent in goods. Referring to the barter concept, an article in \"Life\" magazine's July 31, 1939, issue reported, \"What sounded like the craziest idea in the history of the U.S. theater is now a booming success.\"\n\nActors were kept very busy, even when they did not have parts in current plays. They contributed to the theatre's overall success by working on scenery, collecting props, directing and working in the cafeteria at the Barter Inn, where members of the troupe boarded.\n\nBarter Theatre's first production was \"After Tomorrow\" by John Golden. An Associated Press news story reported that the production \"was played to a capacity audience that came laden with cakes, fruit, vegetables, poultry\" and a live pig.\n\nWhile remaining based in Abingdon, Barter Theatre has presented plays over a broad geographical area. In 1949, one of its companies produced \"Hamlet\" in Elsinore, Denmark. That same year it had a touring company that did one-night stands in localities in Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina.\n\nIn 2014 the Barter Theatre and the William King Art Center collaborated to produce an art exhibition by Abingdon artists affiliated with the two institutions.\n\nInitially, the theatre's plays were performed in the Abingdon Opera House, and actors stayed at the Martha Washington Inn. In 1935, it moved to the campus of the defunct Stonewall Jackson College for Women. The 1939 article in Life reported that the actors received no pay but were fed well and were housed in the former college's dormitories. The troupe produced plays in the auditorium on the campus. Productions branched out into the surrounding area after three nights on campus, going \"on a ten-day tour of mountain towns and resorts in an ancient bus widey known as 'Bessie.'\"\n\nThe facility in which actors stayed became known as the Barter Inn. Besides housing members of the theatre, the inn offered a limited number of reservations for the public, which provided an opportunity for people to eat with the actors in the inn's cafeteria. In 1950, novelist James Hilton purchased \"several acres of land adjoining the Barter Theater [sic] ... to protect the view from the Barter Inn\" after the property had been advertised as being available for building sites.\n\nIn 1996, a $1.7 million renovation of the building was completed. The depth of the stage was increased from 28 feet to 60 feet. New lighting and sound systems were installed, and the heating and air-conditioning systems were upgraded. The balcony was extended to provide more seats and a better view from that level.\n\nToday, Barter is one of the last year-round professional resident repertory theaters remaining in the United States.\n\nThe current building, originally Sinking Springs Presbyterian Church built in 1833, is the second-oldest theatrical building in the United States. In 1951, its interior was renovated with fittings from the Empire Theatre in New York. The seats from that renovation were later replaced with seats from the Jefferson Theatre in Falls Church, Virginia, after it closed.\n\nEach year, Barter Theatre celebrates its heritage with Barter Days. For these performances, patrons are invited to barter for admission by bringing the equivalent amount of canned food. All food is donated to a local charity.\n\nPorterfield served as director until his death in 1971. Rex Partington was selected as the next artistic director, serving from 1972 to 1992. Since 1992, Richard Rose has served as the Barter Theatre's third artistic director. The Barter's continued success under their leadership made it the first regional theater \"to survive the passing of its founder.\"\n\nMany well-known stars of stage, screen and television have performed early in their careers at Barter, including Gregory Peck, Ernest Borgnine, Patricia Neal, Ned Beatty, Hume Cronyn, Gary Collins, Frances Fisher, Kevin Spacey, Larry Linville, John Glover, Jim Varney, and Wayne Knight. Will Bigham, the 2007 winner of \"On The Lot,\" acted at Barter Theatre for several years.\n\nThe theatre is located within the Abingdon Historic District. The main theatre (named Gilliam Stage) has 505 seats with 216 of those in the balcony, and Barter Stage II (Named Smith Theatre) has 167.\n\n\n2019 season schedule\n\"Camelot\" February 21 – March 30 at Gilliam Stage\n\"Morning After Grace\" February 7 – March 31 at Stage II\n\"Madame Buttermilk\" April 5 – May 11 at Gilliam Stage\nShakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\" April 11 – May 4 at Stage II\n\"Shrek: The Musical\" May 18 – August 25 at Gilliam Stage \n\"Exit Laughing\" May 30 – August 24 at Gilliam Stage\n\"Church Basement Ladies\" May 12 – August 25 at Stage II\n\"La Cage Aux Folles\" June 14 – August 24 at Stage II\n\"Maytag Virgin\" Aug 27 – Nov 10 at Stage II\n\"Wait Until Dark\" Sep 6 – Nov 8 at Gilliam Stage\n\"The Producers\" Sept 19 – Nov 9 at Gilliam Stage\n\"The Loophole\" Sept 13 – Nov 8 at Stage II\n\"White Christmas\" Nov 15 – Dec 29 at Gilliam Stage\n\"Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol\" Nov 21 – Dec 22 at Stage II\n\"The Santaland Diaries\" Nov 26 – Dec 29 at Stage II\n\nThe Barter Players schedule\nClassic theatre for kids of all ages\n\"The Princess and the Pea\" April 23-May25 at Stage II\n\"Dr. Seuss's The Cat in the Hat\" April 24 – May 26 at Gilliam Stage\n\"James and the Giant Peach\" May 28 – June 22 at Stage II\n\"The Little Mermaid\" June 25 – July 20 at Stage II\n\"Tarzan\" July 23 – Aug 10 at Stage II\n\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" Oct 1 – Nov 13 at Stage II\n\"'Twas the Night Before Christmas\" Nov 19 – Dec 21 at Gilliam Stage\n\n"}

{"id": "2073513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073513", "title": "Harzburg", "text": "Harzburg\n\nThe Harzburg, also called Große Harzburg (\"Great Harz Castle\"), is a former imperial castle, situated on the northwestern edge of the Harz mountain range overlooking the spa resort of Bad Harzburg in Goslar District in the state of Lower Saxony, Germany. It was erected from 1065 to 1068 at the behest of King Henry IV of Germany, slighted during the Saxon Rebellion in 1073-75, and a century later rebuilt under Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and his Welf successor Otto IV, who died here in 1218.\n\nLater used as a robber baron's lair, the hill castle crumbled into ruins over the centuries. Today it has almost completely disappeared; only fragments of the foundation walls and the towers together with the castle well are preserved.\n\nMentioned as \"Hartesburg\" in a 1071 deed, the name of the castle () is derived from the Harz mountain range, called \"Hart\" in Middle Low German, and is probably affiliated with \"hardt\" meaning \"mountain forest\". Therefore, \"Harzburg\" can be translated as \"Harz Castle\".\n\nThe ruins of the \"Große Harzburg\" are located above the spa town and the Radau valley, on the top of the Großer Burgberg hill at a height of . The summit can be reached by the Burgberg Cable Car and has an outstanding view past the neighbouring summit of \"Kleiner Burgberg\" () in the northwest over the northern Harz Foreland with the Harly hill range and far into the North German Plain. Southwards, the view goes over the densely forested mountains of the Harz National Park up to the Brocken massif.\n\nThe remains of the walls on the Großer Burgberg summit are open to the public. The layout of the castle and its remnants are explained on information boards at the site. It had two different \"bergfrieds\"; the square one has been partially rebuilt in modern times (see photo). One interesting feature is the wide moat driven through the rock that separates the castle complex into an east and a west wing, linked by a modern stone bridge. The castle well drew drinking water from the nearby Sachsenbrunnen, an enclosed spring in the woods. In medieval times, the water was transferred over several hundred metres in wooden pipes.\n\nThe viewpoint on the northern edge of the castle plateau is marked by the high Canossa Column, erected in 1877 during the German \"Kulturkampf\" conflict in honour of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck on the 800th anniversary of King Henry's Walk to Canossa. In addition, the former castle grounds comprise the more than two-hundred-year-old Bismarck Elm, a Harz folktales memorial hall erected from 1928 to 1932, a modern statue of the alleged pagan god Krodo, as well as a restaurant. \n\nTo the north, on the nearby hill of \"Kleiner Burgberg\", are the remains of the so-called \"Kleine Harzburg\" (\"Little Harz Castle\") outlook, and to the east on the nearby \"Sachsenberg\" are the traces of a rampart, possibly constructed by the rebellious Saxons to besiege the \"Große Harzburg\" (see below).\n\nAlready in 924/926 King Henry the Fowler had reached an armistice with the Hungarian invaders at nearby Werla Castle. In the 11th century, the Salian emperor Henry III had made the Imperial Palace of Goslar one of his favourite residences. He did, however, arouse the disfavour of the local Saxon nobility and the Billung dukes, not only by his Franconian descendance, but also due to the expensive maintaining of his Imperial court. Henry III died in 1056 at Bodfeld Castle and when his son King Henry IV, came of age in 1065, he soon renewed the Saxon conflict laying claim to several domains around the Harz mountains. \n\nDuring Henry's minority and the regency of his mother Agnes of Poitou, the Saxon nobles had strengthened their position. The local count Otto of Nordheim, Duke of Bavaria since 1061, had even been involved in Henry's abduction during the 1062 Coup of Kaiserswerth. In turn, the \"Große Harzburg\" (\"Hartesburg\") was erected during a large-scale castle building programme in the Duchy of Saxony from 1065 to 1068. Intended as a demonstration of power in the Saxon mainland, the extended complex was strategically sited by King Henry's architect Bishop Benno II of Osnabrück providing protection for the nearby Goslar imperial palace and the mines of Rammelsberg. Its walls extend right up to the steep face of the conical hilltop. At the time it was built the castle was impregnable.\n\nDespite its defensive strength, the castle was also especially palatial. For example, it contained, amongst other things, unusually large, three-roomed great hall and collegiate church, to which Henry had many relics transferred. He even had a sort of family vault built, in which he laid the mortal remains of his brother, Duke Conrad II of Bavaria and his son, Henry, both of whom died young.\n\nAccording to the chronicler Lambert of Hersfeld, the Saxon Rebellion broke out when on 29 June 1073 several nobles marched against the king residing in the Imperial Palace of Goslar. Henry had to flee along with the Imperial Regalia into the walls of the Harzburg. The besieging forces led by Otto of Nordheim and Bishop Burchard II of Halberstadt allegedly numbered 60,000 whilst his garrison only had 300 men. The king finally fled to Franconia in the night to 10 August, according to legend, through the well of the besieged castle and a secret passage. \n\nThe king initially did not gain much support by the German princes and in the 1074 Treaty of Gerstungen he was forced to agree to slight his castles, including the Harzburg. He hesitated, however, and only had the walls and towers demolished, whilst the buildings themselves remained. But in the spring of 1074 the Harzburg was plundered by annoyed peasants and completely destroyed. The collegiate church was not spared and the royal family tomb was desecrated. This incident prompted widespread indignation and gave Henry cause to advance with all his might against the rebellious Saxons again and so, on 9 June 1075, the rebels were defeated at the Battle of Langensalza.\n\nHenry IV never returned to the Harzburg. Pope Gregory VII, who would become a bitter enemy during the Investiture Controversy, imposed a ban on the devastated site. In January 1077, the king had to make the Walk to Canossa to obtain the revocation of his excommunication.\n\nDuring the conflict of the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick I with the Welf duke Henry the Lion, the rebuilding work on the castle continued until 1180. In January 1076 Henry had claimed the enfeoffment with Goslar and the Rammelsberg mines in turn for his support against the rebellious Italian cities of the Lombard League. The duke was deposed in 1180, yet Frederick felt it was necessary to protect Goslar against Henry's forces. \n\nThe complex was completed by Henry's son Emperor Otto IV, sole King of the Romans upon his rival Philip of Swabia in 1208. He was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Innocent III the next year, however, the two fell out soon after. Banned by the pope, he had to witness the election of the Hohenstaufen scion Frederick II in September 1211. Defeated by King Philip II of France in the 1214 Battle of Bouvines, he retired to his Saxon homelands and died at the Harzburg on 19 May 1218. The fortress lost its immediate function as an imperial castle as Otto's brother Henry of Brunswick had to surrender the Imperial Regalia to the Hohenstaufen dynasty. \n\nIn 1222 the Harzburg was awarded the title of \"castrum imperiale\" again. Relying on the existing imperial enfeoffment of the Harzburg seat, the character of the castle as an imperial fortress remained largely intact up to the time the Hohenstaufen dynasty became extinct and the castle was pledged to the Counts of Wernigerode in 1269.\n\nThe following centuries were characterized by frequent changes of ownership. About 1370 it was occupied by the Welf duke Otto of Brunswick-Göttingen during the War of the Lüneburg Succession and entrusted to his \"ministerialis\" Hans von Schwicheldt, against fierce protest raised by the Wernigerode counts. In the early 15th century the Harzburg was pledged as a fief to the three sons of Hans von Schwicheldt, who turned it into a robber baron castle and ravaged the surrounding Brunswick, Hildesheim and Halberstadt lands. \n\nThe importance of the fortress decreased steadily, resulting in its slow decline. A rebuilding of the castle in the 16th century was never carried out due to the high cost. During the Thirty Years' War, the castle changed hands several times, although its garrison remained intact. Since this type of fortification had become insignificant due to the changed nature of warfare, demolition of the remaining elements of the ruin began in 1650. Since then the castle has amounted to little more than its foundation ruins and well. The urban settlement of \"Neustadt\" at the foot of the \"Großer Burgberg\" adopted the castle's name in 1892.\n\n\n"}

The most recent installment was published in 1989. The final volume, \"Since Noon Yesterday\", is, as of 2005, unpublished.\n\nAvallone was prolific at writing movie and TV tie-ins, numbering more than two dozen, beginning with 1963's \"The Main Attraction\". His most successful was the first of the \"Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" novels, \"The Thousand Coffins Affair\". \"I did it for a flat fee of $1,000 with a handshake deal to do the rest of the series,\" he said in 1989. \"Then Ace double-crossed everybody and they got follow-up writers to do the others. They sold it to 60 foreign countries, and it stayed in print until 1970. Every copy of the book says April, 1965—there's no record of a printing order or anything—but they had five printings in the first three months! Everything to worked right in The Thousand Coffins Affair and it sort of set the pattern for all kinds of TV spy books. I was very satisfied with it, and despite the monetary beating I took, it did get me a lot of work down through the years.\" Avallone said he faced some minor editorial restrictions on the \"U.N.C.L.E.\" book, at the studio's insistence. The villainous organization of the book, Golgotha, was described by Avallone as being German. \"MGM insisted on making them Russians—and of course this is 1964, the height of the Cold War,\" he said. Due to his involvement in the tie-ins, the cover of the January 1967 issue of \"The Saint Magazine\", edited by Leslie Charteris, erroneously identified Avallone as the creator of the TV series.\n\nHis tie-ins included \"Hawaii Five-O\", \"Mannix\", \"Friday the 13th Part III\", \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\" and \"The Partridge Family\".

{"id": "2073543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073543", "title": "The War of the Gargantuas", "text": "The War of the Gargantuas\n\n\"The War of the Gargantuas\" was released in Japan on July 31, 1966 and was given a theatrical release in the United States on July 29, 1970 by Maron Films, on a double-bill with \"Monster Zero\". Since its release, the film has been regarded as a cult classic, drawing admiration from artists such as Brad Pitt, Quentin Tarantino, Guillermo del Toro, and Tim Burton.\n\nDuring a rainy night, a fishing boat is attacked by a giant octopus. The octopus is then attacked by a giant, green-haired humanoid monster. After defeating the octopus, the green monster then attacks the boat. A survivor is recovered, who reveals to doctors and police that Frankenstein attacked his boat and ate the crew. The press picks up the story and interviews Dr. Paul Stewart and his assistant, Dr. Akemi Togawa, who once had a baby Frankenstein in their possession for study five years prior. Stewart and Akemi dispel the idea that the attack was caused by their Frankenstein, postulating that his Frankenstein was gentle, would not attack nor eat people, nor would he live in the ocean as he was found in the mountains and likely died after he escaped.\n\nAnother boat is attacked and villagers see the green Frankenstein off the coast at the same time that a mountain guide reports seeing Frankenstein in the Japanese Alps. Stewart and Akemi investigate the mountains and find giant footprints in the snow. Their colleague, Dr. Majida, collects tissue samples from the second boat. The green Frankenstein attacks Haneda Airport, eats a woman, and returns to the sea after the clouds clear. Stewart and Akemi leave for Tokyo for a meeting with the military to discuss plans to kill the monster. Majida deduces that the green Frankenstein is sensitive to light. The green Frankenstein briefly appears in Tokyo, but is driven away by bright lights. It retreats to the mountains, where the military counterattacks it. Then, a second Frankenstein, brown-haired in appearance, appears and comes to the green Frankenstein's aide, helping it escape.\n\nStewart and Akemi conclude that the brown Frankenstein is their former subject. To distinguish the monsters, the military designate the green and brown Frankensteins as Gaira and Sanda, respectively. After collecting and examining tissue samples from both monsters, Stewart concludes that Gaira is Sanda's clone. He theorizes that a piece of Sanda's tissue made its way out to sea, where it survived off plankton and evolved into Gaira. During a hiking trip, Stewart, Akemi, and several hikers run away from Gaira. Akemi falls off a ledge, but Sanda saves her in time, injuring his leg in the process. Stewart and Akemi try to convince the military that only Gaira should be killed while Sanda should be spared, but the army ignores their pleas, unwilling to risk letting either monster live. After discovering that Gaira devoured people, Sanda attacks him. Gaira escapes with Sanda pursuing and heads towards Tokyo, no longer deterred by the city lights as they alert him to the presence of food.\n\nDuring the evacuation, Akemi vows to save Sanda, but runs into Gaira instead. Sanda stops Gaira from devouring Akemi and Stewart carries her to safety. Sanda tries to plead with Gaira, but the green monster engages Sanda in battle. Stewart tries to convince the military to give Sanda time to defeat Gaira, but fails. However, the military aides Sanda as his battle with Gaira moves from Tokyo to Tokyo Bay and further out to sea. As the military drops bombs around the battling Frankensteins, an underwater volcano suddenly erupts, swallowing both monsters. Majida informs Stewart and Akemi that the monsters' deaths could not be confirmed due to the intense heat, but stresses that nothing could have survived the eruption.\n\n\"The War of the Gargantuas\" was the third and final co-production collaboration between Toho and Henry G. Saperstein's UPA. Towards the end of 1965, Toho informed director Ishirō Honda that his director's contract would not be renewed and Iwao Mori told him that he would need to speak with producer Tomoyuki Tanaka about each assignment. Seiji Tani, Honda's new chief assistant, spoke about actor Russ Tamblyn and Honda not agreeing on set, with Tamblyn often doing the exact opposite of what Honda instructed, Tani stated: \"Honda-san had to hold back and bear so much during that one. [Russ Tamblyn] was such an asshole\" Tamblyn felt his lines in the film were so bad that he improvised them all. It was co-producer Saperstein's choice to replace Nick Adams with Tamblyn, later stating, \"Tamblyn was a royal pain in the ass\".\n\nThe film was originally announced as \"The Frankenstein Brothers\", then \"The Two Frankensteins\", \"Frankenstein vs. Frankenstein\", \"Frankenstein's Decisive Battle\", and \"Frankenstein's Fight\" during script writing processes. The film was originally intended as a sequel to \"Frankenstein Conquers the World\", with Honda biographers Ryfle and Godziszewski noting that the continuity between the two films was \"somewhat fuzzy\". The film was created quickly, with writer Kimura's final draft on the screenplay being dated 23 April 1966. Honda shot the film's dramatic footage between May 9 and June 4 with Tsuburaya's special effects crew finishing in mid-July. The American version had Honda shoot additional scenes and UPA had Toho release the negatives, outtakes and other footage such as sound and music elements. Tab Hunter was originally cast as Dr. Stewart, but was replaced by Tamblyn during pre-production.\n\nToho commissioned an English dub from Frontier Enterprises, a Tokyo-based company, for international territories. Referred to as the \"international dub\", this version is a direct translation of the Japanese version, keeping references to the monsters as Frankensteins and even having Russ Tamblyn's English dialogue dubbed over by another actor. Toho's international dub remained unreleased until late 2017, when the film and other Godzilla titles appeared on Starz's streaming service after Janus Films and The Criterion Collection obtained the rights to the films.\n\nCo-producer Henry G. Saperstein commissioned a separate English dub from Glen Glenn Sound, a Los Angeles-based company, for the film's American release. This version omits all references to \"Frankenstein Conquers the World\", with the creatures being referred to as \"Gargantuas\" instead of \"Frankensteins\". This version also includes additional footage not featured in the Japanese version, making the American version run at 92 minutes. Tamblyn's original dialogue soundtrack got lost during production and he was called back to re-dub his lines for the film's American release. Tamblyn had to work without a script and had to rely on improvising his lines based on the footage he was watching and due to being unable to remember his original lines. Tamblyn's voice was dubbed for the Japanese version.\n\nThe film was released theatrically in Japan on July 31, 1966 by Toho. The Glen Glenn Sound English dub received a theatrical release in the United States by Maron Films as \"The War of the Gargantuas\" on July 29, 1970, where it was released as a double feature with \"Monster Zero\", which was also dubbed by Glen Glenn Sound. In the United Kingdom, the film was titled Duel of the Gargantuas. \"The War of the Gargantuas\" and \"Monster Zero\" were intended to be released earlier; however, distributors did not think that either film had potential until 1970, when Saperstein made a deal with Maron Films.\n\nIn 2008, Classic Media released a 2-disc DVD of the film as a double feature with \"Rodan\". Both films included their original Japanese version and American English versions, with \"Rodan\" presented in its native full-screen scope and \"The War of the Gargantuas\" in its original widescreen ratio. This release also features the documentary \"Bringing Godzilla Down to Size\", detailing the history of the genre and tokusatsu techniques of the genre. In 2010, Toho released the film on Blu-ray which includes special features such as an audio commentary by Kumi Mizuno, outtakes, trailers, and behind the scenes photo galleries. In 2017, Janus Films and The Criterion Collection acquired the film, as well as other Godzilla titles, to stream on Starz and FilmStruck.\n\nAmerican actor Brad Pitt had cited \"The War of the Gargantuas\" as the film that inspired him to pursue acting. The film inspired parts of Quentin Tarantino's \"\", such as a miniature shot of Tokyo made specifically for the film and the fight scene between Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah, which Tarantino dubbed \"War of the Blonde Gargantuas\". Tarantino had screened the film for Hannah and Hannah's character uses the word \"gargantuan\" several times.\n\nIn an episode of \"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated\" titled \"Battle of the Humungonauts\", the episode parodies the film by featuring two hairy creatures similar in appearance to Sanda and Gaira, riffing the film's title, and even featuring a cover of Kipp Hamilton's \"The Words Get Stuck in My Throat\". American film director Tim Burton noted the film was a favorite of his and his daughter's. Mexican film director Guillermo del Toro cited \"The War of the Gargantuas\" and its predecessor \"Frankenstein Conquers the World\" as two of his top five favorite \"kaiju\" films and cited \"The War of the Gargantuas\" as an influence on the opening for \"Pacific Rim\". The American band Devo performed a live version of \"The Words Get Stuck in My Throat\" in 1978. In August 2019, Michael Dougherty, director and co-writer of \"\", expressed interest in rebooting and adapting the Gargantuas for the MonsterVerse.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2073557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073557", "title": "Bobby Fischer", "text": "Bobby Fischer\n\nRobert James Fischer (March 9, 1943January 17, 2008) was an American chess grandmaster and the eleventh World Chess Champion. Many consider him to be the greatest chess player of all time.\nHe showed great skill in chess from an early age; at 13, he won a known as \"The Game of the Century\". At age 14, he became the youngest ever U.S. Chess Champion, and at 15, he became both the youngest grandmaster (GM) up to that time and the youngest candidate for the World Championship. At age 20, Fischer won the 1963/64 US Championship with 11 wins in 11 games, the only perfect score in the history of the tournament. His book \"My 60 Memorable Games\", published in 1969, is regarded as essential reading. He won the 1970 Interzonal Tournament by a record 3½-point margin, and won 20 consecutive games, including two unprecedented 6–0 sweeps, in the Candidates Matches. In July 1971, he became the first official FIDE number-one-rated player.\n\nFischer won the World Chess Championship in 1972, defeating Boris Spassky of the USSR, in a match held in Reykjavík, Iceland. Publicized as a Cold War confrontation between the US and USSR, it attracted more worldwide interest than any chess championship before or since. In 1975, Fischer refused to defend his title when an agreement could not be reached with FIDE, chess's international governing body, over one of the conditions for the match. Under FIDE rules, this resulted in Soviet GM Anatoly Karpov, who had won the qualifying Candidates' cycle, being named the new world champion by default.\n\nAfter forfeiting his title as World Champion, Fischer became reclusive and sometimes erratic, disappearing from both competitive chess and the public eye. In 1992, he reemerged to win an unofficial rematch against Spassky. It was held in Yugoslavia, which was under a United Nations embargo at the time. His participation led to a conflict with the US government, which warned Fischer that his participation in the match would violate an executive order imposing US sanctions on Yugoslavia. The US government ultimately issued a warrant for his arrest. After that, Fischer lived his life as an émigré. In 2004, he was arrested in Japan and held for several months for using a passport that had been revoked by the US government. Eventually, he was granted an Icelandic passport and citizenship by a special act of the Icelandic Althing, allowing him to live in Iceland until his death in 2008.\n\nFischer made numerous lasting contributions to chess. In the 1990s, he patented a modified chess timing system that added a time increment after each move, now a standard practice in top tournament and match play. He also invented Fischer random chess, a new variant of chess also known as Chess960.\n\nBobby Fischer was born at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, on March 9, 1943. His birth certificate listed his father as Hans-Gerhardt Fischer, also known as Gerardo Liebscher, a German biophysicist. His mother, Regina Wender Fischer, was a US citizen, born in Switzerland; her parents were Polish Jews. Raised in St. Louis, Missouri, Regina became a teacher, registered nurse, and later a physician.\n\nAfter graduating from college in her teens, Regina traveled to Germany to visit her brother. It was there she met geneticist and future Nobel Prize winner Hermann Joseph Muller, who persuaded her to move to Moscow to study medicine. She enrolled at I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, where she met Hans-Gerhardt, whom she married in November 1933. In 1938, Hans-Gerhardt and Regina had a daughter, Joan Fischer. The reemergence of anti-Semitism under Stalin prompted Regina to go with Joan to Paris, where Regina became an English teacher. The threat of a German invasion led her and Joan to go to the United States in 1939. Regina and Hans-Gerhardt had separated in Moscow, although they did not officially divorce until 1945.\n\nAt the time of her son's birth, Regina was homeless and shuttled to different jobs and schools around the country to support her family. She engaged in political activism, and raised both Bobby and Joan as a single parent.\n\nIn 1949, the family moved to Manhattan and the following year to Brooklyn, New York City, where she studied for her master's degree in nursing and subsequently began working in that field.\n\nIn 2002, Peter Nicholas and Clea Benson of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" published an investigative report backed by detailed and compelling evidence that indicated that Bobby Fischer's biological father was actually Paul Nemenyi. Nemenyi, a Hungarian mathematician and physicist of Jewish heritage, was considered an expert in fluid and applied mechanics. Benson and Nicholas continued their work and gathered additional evidence in court records, personal interviews, and even a summary of the FBI investigation written by J. Edgar Hoover, which supported their earlier conclusions.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, the FBI investigated Regina and her circle for her alleged communist sympathies, as well as her time living in Moscow. FBI files note that Hans-Gerhardt Fischer never entered the United States, while recording that Nemenyi took a keen interest in Fischer's upbringing. Not only were Regina and Nemenyi reported to have had an affair in 1942, but Nemenyi made monthly child support payments to Regina and paid for Bobby's schooling until his own death in 1952. In addition, Nicholas and Benson found letters by Nemenyi's first son, Peter, identifying Bobby Fischer as his brother.\n\nIn March 1949, 6-year-old Bobby and his sister Joan learned how to play chess using the instructions from a set bought at a candy store. When Joan lost interest in chess and Regina did not have time to play, Fischer was left to play many of his first games against himself. When the family vacationed at Patchogue, Long Island, New York, that summer, Bobby found a book of old chess games and studied it intensely.\n\nIn 1950, the family moved to Brooklyn, first to an apartment at the corner of Union Street and Franklin Avenue, and later to a two-bedroom apartment at 560 Lincoln Place. It was there that \"Fischer soon became so engrossed in the game that Regina feared he was spending too much time alone\". As a result, on November 14, 1950, Regina sent a postcard to the \"Brooklyn Eagle\" newspaper, seeking to place an ad inquiring whether other children of Bobby's age might be interested in playing chess with him. The paper rejected her ad, because no one could figure out how to classify it, but forwarded her inquiry to Hermann Helms, the \"Dean of American Chess\", who told her that Master Max Pavey, former Scottish champion, would be giving a simultaneous exhibition on January 17, 1951. Fischer played in the exhibition. Although he held on for 15 minutes, drawing a crowd of onlookers, he eventually lost to the chess master.\n\nOne of the spectators was Brooklyn Chess Club President, Carmine Nigro, an American chess expert of near master strength and an instructor. Nigro was so impressed with Fischer's play that he introduced him to the club and began teaching him. Fischer noted of his time with Nigro: \"Mr. Nigro was possibly not the best player in the world, but he was a very good teacher. Meeting him was probably a decisive factor in my going ahead with chess.\"\n\nNigro hosted Fischer's first chess tournament at his home in 1952. In the summer of 1955, Fischer, then 12 years old, joined the Manhattan Chess Club. Fischer's relationship with Nigro lasted until 1956, when Nigro moved away.\n\nIn June 1956, Fischer began attending the Hawthorne Chess Club, based in master John \"Jack\" W. Collins' home. Collins taught chess to children, and has been described as Fischer's teacher, but Collins himself suggested that he did not actually teach Fischer, and the relationship might be more accurately described as one of mentorship.\n\nFischer played thousands of blitz and offhand games with Collins and other strong players, studied the books in Collins' large chess library, and ate almost as many dinners at Collins' home as his own.\n\nOn the tenth national rating list of the United States Chess Federation (USCF), published on May 20, 1956, Fischer's rating was 1726, more than 900 points below top-rated Samuel Reshevsky (2663). His playing strength increased rapidly that year.\nIn March 1956, the Log Cabin Chess Club of West Orange, New Jersey (based in the home of the club's eccentric multi-millionaire founder and patron Elliot Forry Laucks) took Fischer on a tour to Cuba, where he gave a 12-board simultaneous exhibition at Havana's Capablanca Chess Club, winning ten games and drawing two. On this tour the club played a series of matches against other clubs. Fischer played , behind International Master Norman Whitaker. Whitaker and Fischer were the leading scorers for the club, each scoring 5½ points out of 7 games.\n\nIn July 1956, Fischer won the US Junior Chess Championship, scoring 8½/10 at Philadelphia to become the youngest-ever Junior Champion at age 13. At the 1956 US Open Chess Championship in Oklahoma City, he scored 8½/12 to tie for 4th–8th places, with Arthur Bisguier winning. In the first Canadian Open Chess Championship at Montreal 1956, he scored 7/10 to tie for 8th–12th places, with Larry Evans winning. In November, Fischer played in the 1956 Eastern States Open Championship in Washington, D.C., tying for second with William Lombardy, Nicholas Rossolimo, and Arthur Feuerstein, with Hans Berliner taking first by a half-point.\n\nFischer accepted an invitation to play in the Third Lessing J. Rosenwald Trophy Tournament in New York City (1956), a premier tournament limited to the 12 players considered the best in the country. Although Fischer's rating was not among the top 12 in the country, he received entry by special consideration. Playing against top opposition, the 13-year-old Fischer could only score 4½/11, tying for 8th–9th place. Yet he won the for his game against International Master Donald Byrne, in which Fischer sacrificed his queen to unleash an unstoppable attack. Hans Kmoch called it \"The Game of the Century\", writing: \"The following game, a stunning masterpiece of play performed by a boy of 13 against a formidable opponent, matches the finest on record in the history of chess prodigies\". According to Frank Brady, The Game of the Century' has been talked about, analyzed, and admired for more than fifty years, and it will probably be a part of the canon of chess for many years to come.\" \"In reflecting on his game a while after it occurred, Bobby was refreshingly modest: 'I just made the moves I thought were best. I was just lucky.\n\nIn 1957, Fischer played a two-game match against former World Champion Max Euwe at New York, losing ½–1½. On the USCF's eleventh national rating list, published on May 5, 1957, Fischer was rated 2231—over 500 points higher than his rating a year before. This made him the country's youngest ever chess master up to that point. In July, he successfully defended his US Junior title, scoring 8½/9 at San Francisco. As a result of his strong tournament results, Fischer's rating went up to 2298, \"making him among the top ten active players in the country\". In August, he scored 10/12 at the US Open Chess Championship in Cleveland, winning on tie-breaking points over Arthur Bisguier. This made Fischer the youngest ever US Open Champion. He won the New Jersey Open Championship, scoring 6½/7. He then defeated the young Filipino master Rodolfo Tan Cardoso 6–2 in a New York match sponsored by Pepsi-Cola.\n\nBased on Fischer's rating and strong results, the USCF invited him to play in the 1957/58 US Championship. The tournament included such luminaries as six-time US champion Samuel Reshevsky, defending US champion Arthur Bisguier, and William Lombardy, who in August had won the World Junior Championship. Bisguier predicted that Fischer would \"finish slightly over the center mark\". Despite all the predictions to the contrary, Fischer scored eight wins and five draws to win the tournament by a one-point margin, with 10½/13. Still two months shy of his 15th birthday, Fischer became the youngest ever US champion. Since the championship that year was also the US Zonal Championship, Fischer's victory earned him the title of International Master. Fischer's victory in the US Championship sent his rating up to 2626, making him the second highest rated player in the United States, behind only Reshevsky (2713), and qualified him to participate in the 1958 Portorož Interzonal, the next step toward challenging the World Champion.\n\nBobby wanted to go to Moscow. At his pleading, \"Regina wrote directly to the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, requesting an invitation for Bobby to participate in the World Youth and Student Festival. The reply—affirmative—came too late for him to go.\" Regina did not have the money to pay the airfare, but in the following year Fischer was invited onto the game show \"I've Got a Secret\", where, thanks to Regina's efforts, the producers of the show arranged two round-trip tickets to the Soviet Union.\n\nOnce in Russia, Fischer was invited by the Soviet Union to Moscow, where International Master Lev Abramov would serve as a guide to Bobby and his sister, Joan. Upon arrival, Fischer immediately demanded that he be taken to the Moscow Central Chess Club, where he played speed chess with \"two young Soviet masters\", Evgeni Vasiukov and Alexander Nikitin, winning every game. Chess author V. I. Linder writes about the impression Fischer gave grandmaster Vladimir Alatortsev when he played blitz against the Soviet masters: \"Back in 1958, in the Central Chess Club, Vladimir Alatortsev saw a tall, angular 15-year-old youth, who in blitz games, crushed almost everyone who crossed his path… Alatortsev was no exception, losing all three games. He was astonished by the play of the young American Robert Fischer, his fantastic self-confidence, amazing chess erudition and simply brilliant play! On arriving home, Vladimir said in admiration to his wife: 'This is the future world champion!\n\nFischer demanded to play against Mikhail Botvinnik, the reigning World Champion. When told that this was impossible, Fischer asked to play Keres. \"Finally, Tigran Petrosian was, on a semi-official basis, summoned to the club…\" where he played speed games with Fischer, winning the majority. \"When Bobby discovered that he wasn't going to play any formal games … he went into a not-so-silent rage\", saying he was fed up \"with these Russian pigs\", which angered the Soviets who saw Fischer as their honored guest. It was then that the Yugoslavian chess officials offered to take in Fischer and Joan as early guests to the Interzonal. Fischer took them up on the offer, arriving in Yugoslavia to play two short training matches against masters Dragoljub Janošević and Milan Matulović. Fischer drew both games against Janošević and then defeated Matulović in Belgrade by 2½–1½.\n\nAt Portorož, Fischer was accompanied by Lombardy. The top six finishers in the Interzonal would qualify for the Candidates Tournament. Most observers doubted that a 15-year-old with no international experience could finish among the six qualifiers at the Interzonal, but Fischer told journalist Miro Radoicic, \"I can draw with the grandmasters, and there are half-a-dozen in the tournament I reckon to beat.\" Despite some bumps in the road and a problematic start, Fischer succeeded in his plan: after a strong finish, he ended up with 12/20 (+6−2=12) to tie for 5th–6th. The Soviet grandmaster Yuri Averbakh observed,\n\nIn the struggle at the board this youth, almost still a child, showed himself to be a full-fledged fighter, demonstrating amazing composure, precise calculation and devilish resourcefulness. I was especially struck not even by his extensive opening knowledge, but his striving everywhere to seek new paths. In Fischer's play an enormous talent was noticeable, and in addition one sensed an enormous amount of work on the study of chess.\n\nSoviet grandmaster David Bronstein said of Fischer's time in Portorož: \"It was interesting for me to observe Fischer, but for a long time I couldn't understand why this 15-year-old boy played chess so well\". Fischer became the youngest person ever to qualify for the Candidates and the youngest ever grandmaster at 15 years, 6 months, 1 day. \"By then everyone knew we had a genius on our hands.\"\n\nBefore the Candidates' Tournament, Fischer won the 1958/59 US Championship (scoring 8½/11). He tied for third (with Borislav Ivkov) in Mar del Plata (scoring 10/14), a half-point behind Luděk Pachman and Miguel Najdorf. He tied for 4th–6th in Santiago (scoring 7½/12) behind Ivkov, Pachman, and Herman Pilnik.\n\nAt the Zürich International Tournament, spring 1959, Fischer finished a point behind future World Champion Mikhail Tal and a half-point behind Yugoslavian grandmaster Svetozar Gligorić.\n\nAlthough Fischer had ended his formal education at age 16, dropping out of Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, he subsequently taught himself several foreign languages so he could read foreign chess periodicals. According to Latvian chess master Alexander Koblencs, even he and Tal could not match the commitment that Fischer had made to chess. Recalling a conversation from the tournament: Tell me, Bobby,' Tal continued, 'what do you think of the playing style of Larissa Volpert?' 'She's too cautious. But you have another girl, Dmitrieva. Her games do appeal to me!' Here we were left literally open-mouthed in astonishment. Misha and I have looked at thousands of games, but it never even occurred to us to study the games of our women players. How could we find the time for this?! Yet Bobby, it turns out, had found the time!\n\nUntil late 1959, Fischer \"had dressed atrociously for a champion, appearing at the most august and distinguished national and international events in sweaters and corduroys.\" Now, encouraged by Pal Benko to dress more smartly, Fischer \"began buying suits from all over the world, hand-tailored and made to order.\" He told journalist Ralph Ginzburg that he had 17 hand-tailored suits and that all of his shirts and shoes were handmade.\n\nAt the age of 16, Fischer finished equal fifth out of eight at the 1959 Candidates Tournament in Bled/Zagreb/Belgrade, Yugoslavia, scoring 12½/28. He was outclassed by tournament winner Tal, who won all four of their individual games. That year, Fischer released his first book of collected games: \"Bobby Fischer's Games of Chess\", published by Simon & Schuster.\n\nFischer's interest in chess became more important than schoolwork, to the point that \"by the time he reached the fourth grade, he'd been in and out of six schools.\" In 1952, Regina got Bobby a scholarship (based on his chess talent and \"astronomically high IQ\") to Brooklyn Community Woodward. Fischer later attended Erasmus Hall High School at the same time as Barbra Streisand and Neil Diamond. In 1959, its student council awarded him a gold medal for his chess achievements. The same year, Fischer dropped out of high school when he turned 16, the earliest he could legally do so. He later explained to Ralph Ginzburg, \"You don't learn anything in school.\"\n\nWhen Fischer was 16, his mother moved out of their apartment to pursue medical training. Her friend Joan Rodker, who had met Regina when the two were \"idealistic communists\" living in Moscow in the 1930s, believes that Fischer resented his mother for being mostly absent as a mother, a communist activist and an admirer of the Soviet Union and that this led to his hatred for the Soviet Union. In letters to Rodker, Fischer's mother states her desire to pursue her own \"obsession\" of training in medicine and writes that her son would have to live in their Brooklyn apartment without her: \"It sounds terrible to leave a 16-year-old to his own devices, but he is probably happier that way\". The apartment was on the edge of Bedford-Stuyvesant, a neighborhood that had one of the highest homicide and general crime rates in New York City. Despite the alienation from her son, Regina, in 1960, protested the practices of the American Chess Foundation and staged a five-hour protest in front of the White House, urging President Dwight D. Eisenhower to send an American team to that year's chess Olympiad (set for Leipzig, East Germany, behind the Iron Curtain) and to help support the team financially.\n\nFischer played in eight US Championships, winning all of them, by at least a one-point margin. His results were:\n\nFischer missed the 1961/62 Championship (he was preparing for the 1962 Interzonal), and there was no 1964/65 event. In his eight US Chess Championships, Fischer lost only three games; to Edmar Mednis in the 1962/63 event, and in consecutive rounds to Samuel Reshevsky, and Robert Byrne in the 1965 championship, culminating in a total score of 74/90 (61 wins, 26 draws, 3 losses).\n\nFischer refused to play in the 1958 Munich Olympiad when his demand to play ahead of Samuel Reshevsky was rejected. Some sources claim that 15-year-old Fischer was unable to arrange leave from attending high school. Fischer later represented the United States on first board at four Men's Chess Olympiads, winning two individual Silver and one individual Bronze medals:\n\nOut of four Men's Chess Olympiads, Fischer scored +40−7=18, for 49/65: 75.4%. In 1966, Fischer narrowly missed the individual gold medal, scoring 88.23% to World Champion Tigran Petrosian's 88.46%. He played four games more than Petrosian, faced stiffer opposition, and would have won the gold if he had accepted Florin Gheorghiu's draw offer, rather than declining it and suffering his only loss.\n\nAt the 1962 Varna Olympiad, Fischer predicted that he would defeat Argentinian GM Miguel Najdorf in 25 moves. Fischer actually did it in 24, becoming the only player to beat Najdorf in the tournament. Ironically, Najdorf lost the game while employing the very opening variation named after him: the Sicilian Najdorf.\n\nFischer had planned to play for the US at the 1968 Lugano Olympiad, but backed out when he saw the poor playing conditions. Both former World Champion Tigran Petrosian and Belgian-American International Master George Koltanowski, the leader of the American team that year, felt that Fischer was justified in not participating in the Olympiad. According to Lombardy, Fischer's non-participation was due to Reshevsky's refusal to yield first board.\n\nIn 1960, Fischer tied for first place with Soviet star Boris Spassky at the strong Mar del Plata Tournament in Argentina, winning by a two-point margin, scoring 13½/15 (+13−1=1), ahead of David Bronstein. Fischer lost only to Spassky; this was the start of their lifelong friendship.\n\nFischer experienced the only failure in his competitive career at the Buenos Aires Tournament (1960), finishing with 8½/19 (+3−5=11), far behind winners Viktor Korchnoi and Samuel Reshevsky with 13/19. According to Larry Evans, Fischer's first sexual experience was with a girl to whom Evans introduced him during the tournament. Pal Benko says that Fischer did horribly in the tournament \"because he got caught up in women and sex. Afterwards, Fischer said he'd never mix women and chess together, and kept the promise.\" Fischer concluded 1960 by winning a small tournament in Reykjavík with 4½/5, and defeating Klaus Darga in an exhibition game in West Berlin.\n\nIn 1961, Fischer started a 16-game match with Reshevsky, split between New York and Los Angeles. Reshevsky, 32 years Fischer's senior, was considered the favorite, since he had far more match experience and had never lost a set match. After 11 games and a tie score (two wins apiece with seven draws), the match ended prematurely due to a scheduling dispute between Fischer and match organizer and sponsor Jacqueline Piatigorsky. Reshevsky was declared the winner, by default, and received the winner's share of the prize fund.\n\nFischer was second in a super-class field, behind only former World Champion Tal, at Bled, 1961. Yet, Fischer defeated Tal head-to-head for the first time in their individual game, scored 3½/4 against the Soviet contingent, and finished as the only unbeaten player, with 13½/19 (+8−0=11).\n\nFischer won the 1962 Stockholm Interzonal by a 2½-point margin, going undefeated, with 17½/22 (+13−0=9). He was the first non-Soviet player to win an Interzonal since FIDE instituted the tournament in 1948. Russian grandmaster Alexander Kotov said of Fischer:\n\nFischer's victory made him a favorite for the Candidates Tournament in Curaçao. Yet, despite his result in the Interzonal, Fischer only finished fourth out of eight with 14/27 (+8−7=12), far behind Tigran Petrosian (17½/27), Efim Geller, and Paul Keres (both 17/27). Tal fell very ill during the tournament, and had to withdraw before completion. Fischer, a friend of Tal, was the only contestant who visited him in the hospital.\n\nFollowing his failure in the 1962 Candidates, Fischer asserted in a \"Sports Illustrated\" article, that three of the five Soviet players (Tigran Petrosian, Paul Keres, and Efim Geller) had a prearranged agreement to quickly draw their games against each other in order to conserve their energy for playing against Fischer. It is generally thought that this accusation is correct. Fischer stated that he would never again participate in a Candidates' tournament, since the format, combined with the alleged collusion, made it impossible for a non-Soviet player to win. Following Fischer's article, FIDE, in late 1962, voted to implement a radical reform of the playoff system, replacing the Candidates' tournament with a format of one-on-one knockout matches; the format that Fischer would dominate in 1971.\n\nFischer defeated Bent Larsen in a summer 1962 exhibition game in Copenhagen for Danish TV. Later that year, Fischer beat Bogdan Śliwa in a team match against Poland in Warsaw.\n\nIn the 1962/63 US Championship, Fischer lost to Edmar Mednis in round one. It was his first loss ever in a US Championship. Bisguier was in excellent form, and Fischer caught up to him only at the end. Tied at 7–3, the two met in the final round. Bisguier stood well in the middlegame, but blundered, handing Fischer his fifth consecutive US championship.\n\nInfluenced by ill will over the aborted 1961 match against Reshevsky, Fischer declined an invitation to play in the 1963 Piatigorsky Cup tournament in Los Angeles, which had a world-class field. He instead played in the Western Open in Bay City, Michigan, which he won with 7½/8. In August–September 1963, Fischer won the New York State Championship at Poughkeepsie, with 7/7, his first perfect score, ahead of Arthur Bisguier and James Sherwin.\n\nIn the 1963/64 US Championship, Fischer achieved his second perfect score, this time against the top-ranked chess players in the country. This result brought Fischer heightened fame, including a profile in \"Life\" magazine. \"Sports Illustrated\" diagrammed each of the 11 games in its article, \"The Amazing Victory Streak of Bobby Fischer\". Such extensive chess coverage was groundbreaking for the top American sports magazine. His 11–0 win in the 1963/64 Championship is the only perfect score in the history of the tournament, and one of about ten perfect scores in high-level chess tournaments ever. David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld called it \"the most remarkable achievement of this kind\". Fischer recalls: \"Motivated by my lopsided result (11–0!), Dr. [Hans] Kmoch congratulated [Larry] Evans (the runner up) on 'winning' the tournament… and then he congratulated me on 'winning the exhibition'.\"\n\nFischer's 21-move victory against Robert Byrne won the brilliancy prize for the tournament. Byrne wrote: The culminating combination is of such depth that, even at the very moment at which I resigned, both grandmasters who were commenting on the play for the spectators in a separate room believed I had a won game!\n\nInternational Master Anthony Saidy recalled his last round encounter with the undefeated Fischer:\n\nGoing into the final game I certainly did not expect to upset Fischer. I hardly knew the opening but played simply, and he went along with the scenario, opting for a N-v-B [i.e., Knight vs. Bishop] endgame with a minimal edge. In the corridor, Evans said to me, \"Good. Show him we're not all children.\"\n\nAt adjournment, Saidy saw a way to force a draw, yet \"sealed a different, wrong move\", and lost. \"Chess publications around the world wrote of the unparalleled achievement. Only Bent Larsen, always a Fischer detractor, was unimpressed: 'Fischer was playing against children.\n\nFischer, eligible as US Champion, decided against his participation in the 1964 Amsterdam Interzonal, taking himself out of the 1966 World Championship cycle, even after FIDE changed the format of the eight-player Candidates Tournament from a round-robin to a series of knockout matches, which eliminated the possibility of collusion. Instead, Fischer embarked on a tour of the United States and Canada from February through May, playing a simultaneous exhibition, and giving a lecture in each of more than 40 cities. He had a 94% winning percentage over more than 2,000 games. Fischer declined an invitation to play for the US in the 1964 Olympiad in Tel Aviv.\n\nFischer wanted to play in the Capablanca Memorial Tournament in Havana in August and September 1965. Since the State Department refused to endorse Fischer's passport as valid for visiting Cuba, he proposed, and the tournament officials and players accepted, a unique arrangement: Fischer played his moves from a room at the Marshall Chess Club, which were then transmitted by teleprinter to Cuba. Luděk Pachman observed that Fischer \"was handicapped by the longer playing session resulting from the time wasted in transmitting the moves, and that is one reason why he lost to three of his chief rivals.\" The tournament was an \"ordeal\" for Fischer, who had to endure eight-hour and sometimes even twelve-hour playing sessions. Despite the handicap, Fischer tied for second through fourth places, with 15/21 (+12−3=6), behind former World Champion Vasily Smyslov, whom Fischer defeated in their individual game. The tournament received extensive media coverage.\n\nIn December, Fischer won his seventh US Championship (1965), with the score of 8½/11 (+8−2=1), despite losing to Robert Byrne and Reshevsky in the eighth and ninth rounds. Fischer also reconciled with Mrs. Piatigorsky, accepting an invitation to the very strong second Piatigorsky Cup (1966) tournament in Santa Monica. Fischer began disastrously and after eight rounds was tied for last with 3/8. He then staged a strong comeback, scoring 7/8 in the next eight rounds. In the end, World Chess Championship finalist Boris Spassky edged him out by a half point, scoring 11½/18 to Fischer's 11/18 (+7−3=8).\n\nNow aged 23, Fischer would win every match or tournament he completed for the rest of his life.\n\nFischer won the US Championship (1966/67) for the eighth and final time, ceding only three draws (+8−0=3), In March–April and August–September, Fischer won strong tournaments at Monte Carlo, with 7/9 (+6−1=2), and Skopje, with 13½/17 (+12−2=3). In the Philippines, Fischer played nine exhibition games against master opponents, scoring 8½/9.\n\nFischer's win in the 1966/67 US Championship qualified him for the next World Championship cycle.\n\nAt the 1967 Interzonal, held at Sousse, Tunisia, Fischer scored 8½ points in the first 10 games, to lead the field. His observance of the Worldwide Church of God's seventh-day Sabbath was honored by the organizers, but deprived Fischer of several rest days, which led to a scheduling dispute, causing Fischer to forfeit two games in protest and later withdraw, eliminating himself from the 1969 World Championship cycle. Communications difficulties with the highly inexperienced local organizers were also a significant factor, since Fischer knew little French and the organizers had very limited English. No one in Tunisian chess had previous experience running an event of this stature.\n\nSince Fischer had completed fewer than half of his scheduled games, all of his results were annulled, meaning players who had played Fischer had those games cancelled, and the scores nullified from the official tournament record.\n\nIn 1968, Fischer won tournaments at Netanya, with 11½/13 (+10−0=3), and Vinkovci, with 11/13 (+9−0=4), by large margins. Fischer then stopped playing for the next 18 months, except for a win against Anthony Saidy in a 1969 New York Metropolitan League team match. That year, Fischer (assisted by grandmaster Larry Evans) released his second book of collected games: \"My 60 Memorable Games\", published by Simon & Schuster. The book \"was an immediate success\".\n\nIn 1970, Fischer began a new effort to become World Champion. His dramatic march toward the title made him a household name and made chess front-page news for a time. He won the title in 1972, but forfeited it three years later.\n\nThe 1969 US Championship was also a zonal qualifier, with the top three finishers advancing to the Interzonal. Fischer, however, had sat out the US Championship because of disagreements about the tournament's format and prize fund. Benko, one of the three qualifiers, agreed to give up his spot in the Interzonal in order to give Fischer another shot at the World Championship; Lombardy, who would have been \"next in line\" after Benko, did the same.\n\nIn 1970 and 1971, Fischer \"dominated his contemporaries to an extent never seen before or since\".\n\nBefore the Interzonal, in March and April 1970, the world's best players competed in the USSR vs. Rest of the World match in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, often referred to as \"the Match of the Century\". There was much surprise when Fischer decided to participate.\n\nWith Evans as his second, Fischer flew to Belgrade with the intention of playing board one for the rest of the world. Danish grandmaster Bent Larsen, however, due to his recent tournament victories, demanded to play instead of Fischer, even though Fischer had the higher Elo rating. To the surprise of everyone, Fischer agreed. Although the USSR team eked out a 20½–19½ victory, \"On the top four boards, the Soviets managed to win only one game out of a possible sixteen. Bobby Fischer was the high scorer for his team, with a 3–1 score against Petrosian (two wins and two draws).\" \"Fischer left no doubt in anyone's mind that he had put his temporary break from the tournament circuit to good use. Petrosian was almost unrecognizable in the first two games, and by the time he had collected himself, although pressing his opponent, he could do no more than draw the last two games of the four-game set\".\n\nAfter the USSR versus the Rest of the World Match, the unofficial World Championship of Lightning Chess (5-minute games) was held at Herceg Novi. \"[The Russians] figured on teaching Fischer a lesson and on bringing him down a peg or two\". Petrosian and Tal were considered the favorites, but Fischer overwhelmed the super-class field with 19/22 (+17−1=4), far ahead of Tal (14½), Korchnoi (14), Petrosian (13½), and Bronstein (13). Fischer lost only one game (to Korchnoi, who was also the only player to achieve an even score against him in the double round robin tournament). Fischer \"crushed such blitz kings as Tal, Petrosian and Vasily Smyslov by a clean score\". Tal marveled that, \"During the entire tournament he didn't leave a single pawn en prise!\", while the other players \"blundered knights and bishops galore\". For Lombardy, who had played many blitz games with Fischer, Fischer's 4½-point margin of victory \"came as a pleasant surprise\".\nIn April–May 1970, Fischer won at Rovinj/Zagreb with 13/17 (+10−1=6), by a two-point margin, ahead of Gligorić, Hort, Korchnoi, Smyslov, and Petrosian. In July–August, Fischer crushed the mostly grandmaster field at Buenos Aires, winning by a 3½-point margin, scoring 15/17 (+13−0=4). Fischer then played first board for the US Team in the 19th Chess Olympiad in Siegen, where he won an individual Silver medal, scoring 10/13 (+8−1=4), with his only loss being to World Champion Boris Spassky. Right after the Olympiad, Fischer defeated Ulf Andersson in an exhibition game for the Swedish newspaper \"Expressen\". Fischer had taken his game to a new level.\n\nFischer won the Interzonal (held in Palma de Mallorca in November and December 1970) with 18½/23 (+15−1=7), far ahead of Larsen, Efim Geller, and Robert Hübner, with 15/23. Fischer finished the tournament with seven consecutive wins. Setting aside the Sousse Interzonal (which Fischer withdrew from while leading), Fischer's victory gave him a string of eight consecutive first prizes in tournaments. Former World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik was not, however, impressed by Fischer's results, stating: \"Fischer has been declared a genius. I do not agree with this… In order to rightly be declared a genius in chess, you have to defeat equal opponents by a big margin. As yet he has not done this\". Despite Botvinnik's remarks, \"Fischer began a miraculous year in the history of chess\".\n\nIn the 1971 Candidates matches, Fischer was set to play against Soviet grandmaster and concert pianist Mark Taimanov in the quarter-finals. The match began in mid-May in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Fischer was generally favored to win. Taimanov had reason to be confident. He was backed by the firm guidance of Botvinnik, who \"had thoroughly analysed Fischer's record and put together a 'dossier' on him\", from when he was in talks to play Fischer in a match \"a couple of years earlier\". After Fischer defeated Taimanov in the second game of the match, Taimanov asked Fischer how he managed to come up with the move 12. N1c3, to which Fischer replied \"that the idea was not his—he had come across it in the monograph by the Soviet master Alexander Nikitin in a footnote\". Taimanov said of this: \"It is staggering that I, an expert on the Sicilian, should have missed this theoretically significant idea by my compatriot, while Fischer had uncovered it in a book in a foreign language!\" With the score at 4–0, in Fischer's favor, the fifth game adjournment was a sight to behold. Schonberg explains the scene:\n\nTaimanov came to Vancouver with two seconds, both grandmasters. Fischer was alone. He thought that the sight of Taimanov and his seconds was the funniest thing he had ever seen. There Taimanov and his seconds would sit, six hands flying, pocket sets waving in the air, while variations were being spouted all over the place. And there sat Taimanov with a confused look on his face. Just before resuming play [in the fifth game] the seconds were giving Taimanov some last-minute advice. When poor Taimanov entered the playing room and sat down to confront Fischer, his head was so full of conflicting continuations that he became rattled, left a Rook \"en prise\" and immediately resigned.\n\nFischer beat Taimanov by the score of 6–0. There was little precedent for such a lopsided score in a match leading to the World Championship.\n\nUpon losing the final game of the match, Taimanov shrugged his shoulders, saying sadly to Fischer: \"Well, I still have my music.\" As a result of his performance, Taimanov \"was thrown out of the USSR team and forbidden to travel for two years. He was banned from writing articles, was deprived of his monthly stipend… [and] the authorities prohibited him from performing on the concert platform.\" \"The crushing loss virtually ended Taimanov's chess career.\"\n\nFischer was next scheduled to play against Danish grandmaster Bent Larsen. \"Spassky predicted a tight struggle: 'Larsen is a little stronger in spirit Before the match, Botvinnik had told a Soviet television audience:\n\nIt is hard to say how their match will end, but it is clear that such an easy victory as in Vancouver [against Taimanov] will not be given to Fischer. I think Larsen has unpleasant surprises in store for [Fischer], all the more since having dealt with Taimanov thus, Fischer will want to do just the same to Larsen and this is impossible.\n\nFischer beat Larsen by the identical score of 6–0. Robert Byrne writes: \"To a certain extent I could grasp the Taimanov match as a kind of curiosity–almost a freak, a strange chess occurrence that would never occur again. But now I am at a loss for anything whatever to say… So, it is out of the question for me to explain how Bobby, how anyone, could win six games in a row from such a genius of the game as Bent Larsen\". Just a year before, Larsen had played first board for the Rest of the World team ahead of Fischer, and had handed Fischer his only loss at the Interzonal. Garry Kasparov later wrote that no player had ever shown a superiority over his rivals comparable to Fischer's \"incredible\" 12–0 score in the two matches. Chess statistician Jeff Sonas concludes that the victory over Larsen gave Fischer the \"highest single-match performance rating ever\".\n\nOn August 8, 1971, while preparing for his last Candidates match with former World Champion Tigran Petrosian, Fischer played in the Manhattan Chess Club Rapid Tournament, winning with 21½/22 against a strong field.\n\nDespite Fischer's results against Taimanov and Larsen, his upcoming match against Petrosian seemed a daunting task. Nevertheless, the Soviet government was concerned about Fischer. \"Reporters asked Petrosian whether the match would last the full twelve games… 'It might be possible that I win it earlier,' Petrosian replied\", and then stated: \"Fischer's [nineteen consecutive] wins do not impress me. He is a great chess player but no genius.\" Petrosian played a strong in the first game, gaining the advantage, but Fischer eventually won the game after Petrosian faltered. This gave Fischer a run of 20 consecutive wins against the world's top players (in the Interzonal and Candidates matches), a winning streak topped only by Steinitz's 25 straight wins in 1873–1882. Petrosian won the second game, finally snapping Fischer's streak. After three consecutive draws, Fischer swept the next four games to win the match 6½–2½ (+5−1=3). \"Sports Illustrated\" ran an article on the match, highlighting Fischer's domination of Petrosian as being due to Petrosian's outdated system of preparation:\n\nFischer's recent record raises the distinct possibility that he has made a breakthrough in modern chess theory. His response to Petrosian's elaborately plotted 11th move in the first game is an example: Russian experts had worked on the variation for weeks, yet when it was thrown at Fischer suddenly, he faced its consequences alone and won by applying simple, classic principles.\n\nUpon completion of the match, Petrosian remarked: \"After the sixth game Fischer really did become a genius. I on the other hand, either had a breakdown or was tired, or something else happened, but the last three games were no longer chess.\" \"Some experts kept insisting that Petrosian was off form, and that he should have had a plus score at the end of the sixth game…\" to which Fischer replied, \"People have been playing against me below strength for fifteen years.\" Fischer's match results befuddled Botvinnik: \"It is hard to talk about Fischer's matches. Since the time that he has been playing them, miracles have begun.\" \"When Petrosian played like Petrosian, Fischer played like a very strong grandmaster, but when Petrosian began making mistakes, Fischer was transformed into a genius.\"\n\nFischer gained a far higher rating than any player in history up to that time. On the July 1972 FIDE rating list, his Elo rating of 2785 was 125 points above (World No. 2) Spassky's rating of 2660. His results put him on the cover of \"Life magazine\", and allowed him to challenge World Champion Boris Spassky, whom he had never beaten (+0−3=2).\n\nFischer's career-long stubbornness about match and tournament conditions was again seen in the run-up to his match with Spassky. Of the possible sites, Fischer's first choice was Belgrade, Yugoslavia, while Spassky's was Reykjavík, Iceland. For a time it appeared that the dispute would be resolved by splitting the match between the two locations, but that arrangement failed. After that issue was resolved, Fischer refused to appear in Iceland until the prize fund was increased. London financier Jim Slater donated an additional US$125,000, bringing the prize fund up to an unprecedented $250,000 ($ million today) and Fischer finally agreed to play.\n\nBefore and during the match, Fischer paid special attention to his physical training and fitness, which was a relatively novel approach for top chess players at that time. Leading up to this match he conducted interviews with 60 Minutes and Dick Cavett explaining the importance of physical fitness in his preparation. He had developed his tennis skills to a good level, and played frequently during off-days in Reykjavík. He had also arranged for exclusive use of his hotel's swimming pool during specified hours, and swam for extended periods, usually late at night. According to Soviet grandmaster Nikolai Krogius, Fischer \"was paying great attention to sport, and that he was swimming and even boxing…\"\n\nThe match took place in Reykjavík from July to September 1972. Fischer was accompanied by William Lombardy; besides assisting with analysis, Lombardy may have played an important role in getting Fischer to play in the match and to stay in it. The match was the first to receive an American broadcast in prime time. Fischer lost the first two games in strange fashion: the first when he played a risky pawn-grab in a drawn endgame, the second by forfeit when he refused to play the game in a dispute over playing conditions. Fischer would likely have forfeited the entire match, but Spassky, not wanting to win by default, yielded to Fischer's demands to move the next game to a back room, away from the cameras, whose presence had upset Fischer. After that game, the match was moved back to the stage and proceeded without further serious incident. Fischer won seven of the next 19 games, losing only one and drawing eleven, to win the match 12½–8½ and become the 11th World Chess Champion.\n\nThe Cold War trappings made the match a media sensation. It was called \"The Match of the Century\", and received front-page media coverage in the United States and around the world. Fischer's win was an American victory in a field that Soviet players – closely identified with and subsidized by the state – had dominated for the previous quarter-century. Kasparov remarked, \"Fischer fits ideologically into the context of the Cold War era: a lone American genius challenges the Soviet chess machine and defeats it\". Dutch grandmaster Jan Timman calls Fischer's victory \"the story of a lonely hero who overcomes an entire empire\". Fischer's sister observed, \"Bobby did all this in a country almost totally without a chess culture. It was as if an Eskimo had cleared a tennis court in the snow and gone on to win the world championship\".\n\nUpon Fischer's return to New York, a Bobby Fischer Day was held. He was offered numerous product endorsement offers worth \"at least $5 million\" ($ million today), all of which he declined. He appeared on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\" with American Olympic swimming champion Mark Spitz and also appeared on The Dick Cavett Show, as well as on a Bob Hope TV special. Membership in the US Chess Federation doubled in 1972, and peaked in 1974; in American chess, these years are commonly referred to as the \"Fischer Boom\". This match attracted more worldwide interest than any chess championship before or since.\n\nFischer was scheduled to defend his title in 1975 against Anatoly Karpov, who had emerged as his challenger. Fischer, who had played no competitive games since his World Championship match with Spassky, laid out a proposal for the match in September 1973, in consultation with FIDE official Fred Cramer. He made three principal (non-negotiable) demands:\n\n\nA FIDE Congress was held in 1974 during the Nice Olympiad. The delegates voted in favor of Fischer's 10-win proposal, but rejected his other two proposals, and limited the number of games in the match to 36. In response to FIDE's ruling, Fischer sent a cable to Euwe on June 27, 1974:\n\nAs I made clear in my telegram to the FIDE delegates, the match conditions I proposed were non-negotiable. Mr. Cramer informs me that the rules of the winner being the first player to win ten games, draws not counting, unlimited number of games and if nine wins to nine match is drawn with champion regaining title and prize fund split equally were rejected by the FIDE delegates. By so doing FIDE has decided against my participation in the 1975 World Chess Championship. Therefore, I resign my FIDE World Chess Championship title. Sincerely, Bobby Fischer.\n\nThe delegates responded by reaffirming their prior decisions, but did not accept Fischer's resignation and requested that he reconsider. Many observers considered Fischer's requested 9–9 clause unfair because it would require the challenger to win by at least two games (10–8). Botvinnik called the 9–9 clause \"unsporting\". Korchnoi, David Bronstein, and Lev Alburt considered the 9–9 clause reasonable.\n\nDue to the continued efforts of US Chess Federation officials, a special FIDE Congress was held in March 1975 in Bergen, Netherlands, in which it was accepted that the match should be of unlimited duration, but the 9–9 clause was once again rejected, by a narrow margin of 35 votes to 32. FIDE set a deadline of April 1, 1975, for Fischer and Karpov to confirm their participation in the match. No reply was received from Fischer by April 3. Thus, by default, Karpov officially became World Champion. In his 1991 autobiography, Karpov professed regret that the match had not taken place, and claimed that the lost opportunity to challenge Fischer held back his own chess development. Karpov met with Fischer several times after 1975, in friendly but ultimately unsuccessful attempts to arrange a match, since Karpov would never agree to play to 10.\n\nBrian Carney opined in \"The Wall Street Journal\" that Fischer's victory over Spassky in 1972 left him nothing to prove, except that perhaps someone could someday beat him, and he was not interested in the risk of losing. He also opined that Fischer's refusal to recognize peers also allowed his paranoia to flower: \"The world championship he won ... validated his view of himself as a chess player, but it also insulated him from the humanizing influences of the world around him. He descended into what can only be considered a kind of madness\".\n\nBronstein felt that Fischer \"had the right to play the match with Karpov on his own conditions\". Korchnoi stated:\n\nWas Fischer right in demanding that the world title be protected by a two point handicap – that the challenger would be considered the winner with a 10–8 score and that the champion would retain his title in the event of a 9–9 draw? Yes, this was quite natural: the champion deserves this, not to mention the fact that further play to the first win in the event of an even score would be nothing short of a lottery – the winner in that case could not claim to have won a convincing victory.\n\nSoviet grandmaster Lev Alburt felt that the decision to not concede to Fischer's demands rested on Karpov's \"sober view of what he was capable of\". Years later, in his 1992 match against Spassky, Fischer said that Karpov refused to play against him under Fischer's conditions.\n\nAfter the 1972 World Chess Championship, Fischer did not play a competitive game in public for nearly 20 years. In 1977 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he played three games against the MIT Greenblatt computer program, winning them all.\n\nHe moved to the Los Angeles area and associated with the Worldwide Church of God for a time. On May 26, 1981, while walking in Pasadena, Fischer was arrested by a police patrolman, because he resembled a man who had just committed a robbery in the area. Fischer, who alleged that he was slightly injured during the arrest, said that he was held for two days, subjected to assault and various types of mistreatment, and released on $1,000 bail. Fischer published a 14-page pamphlet detailing his alleged experiences and saying that his arrest had been \"a frame up and set up\".\n\nIn 1981, Fischer stayed at the home of grandmaster Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with \"Sports Illustrated\" reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:\n\nHe was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.\n\nIn 1988–1990, Fischer had a relationship with German chess player Petra Stadler, who had been put in touch with Fischer by Spassky. When Stadler later published a book about the affair, Spassky apologized to Fischer.\n\nFischer emerged after twenty years of isolation to play Spassky (then tied for 96th–102nd on the FIDE rating list) in a \"Revenge Match of the 20th century\" in 1992. This match took place in Sveti Stefan and Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in spite of a United Nations embargo that included sanctions on commercial activities. Fischer demanded that the organizers bill the match as \"The World Chess Championship\", although Garry Kasparov was the recognized FIDE World Champion. Fischer insisted he was still the true World Champion, and that for all the games in the FIDE-sanctioned World Championship matches, involving Karpov, Korchnoi, and Kasparov, the outcomes had been prearranged. The purse for the rematch was US$5 million, with $3.35 million of the purse to go to the winner.\n\nAccording to grandmaster Andrew Soltis:\n\n[The match games] were of a fairly high quality, particularly when compared with Kasparov's championship matches of 1993, 1995 and 2000, for example. Yet the games also reminded many fans of how out of place Fischer was in 1992. He was still playing the openings of a previous generation. He was, moreover, the only strong player in the world who didn't trust computers and wasn't surrounded by seconds and supplicants.\n\nFischer won the match with 10 wins, 5 losses, and 15 draws. Kasparov stated, \"Bobby is playing OK, nothing more. Maybe his strength is 2600 or 2650. It wouldn't be close between us\". Yasser Seirawan believed that the match proved that Fischer's playing strength was \"somewhere in the top ten in the world\".\n\nFischer and Spassky gave ten press conferences during the match. Seirawan attended the match and met with Fischer on several occasions; the two analyzed some match games and had personal discourse. Seirawan later wrote: \"After September 23 [1992], I threw most of what I'd ever read about Bobby out of my head. Sheer garbage. Bobby is the most misunderstood, misquoted celebrity walking the face of the earth.\" He added that Fischer was not camera shy, smiled and laughed easily, was \"a fine wit\" and \"wholly enjoyable conversationalist\".\n\nThe US Department of the Treasury warned Fischer before the start of the match that his participation was illegal, that it would violate President George H. W. Bush's imposing United Nations Security Council sanctions against engaging in economic activities in Yugoslavia. In response, during the first scheduled press conference on September 1, 1992, in front of the international press, Fischer spat on the US order, saying \"this is my reply\". His violation of the order led US Federal officials to initiate a warrant for his arrest upon completion of the match, citing, in pertinent part, \"Title 50 USC §§1701, 1702, and 1705 and Executive Order 12810\".\n\nPrior to the rematch against Spassky, Fischer had won a training match against Svetozar Gligorić in Sveti Stefan with six wins, one loss and three draws.\n\nAlthough Fischer's mother was Jewish, Fischer rejected attempts to label him as Jewish. In a 1984 letter to the editor of the \"Encyclopaedia Judaica\", Fischer demanded that they remove his name from future editions.\n\nIn an interview in the January 1962 issue of \"Harper's\", he was quoted as saying, \"I read a book lately by Nietzsche and he says religion is just to dull the senses of the people. I agree.\"\n\nFischer associated with the Worldwide Church of God in the mid-1960s. The church prescribed Saturday Sabbath, and forbade work (and competitive chess) on Sabbath. According to his friend and colleague Larry Evans, in 1968 Fischer felt philosophically that \"the world was coming to an end\" and he might as well make some money by publishing \"My 60 Memorable Games\"; Fischer thought that the Rapture was coming soon.\n\nDuring the mid-1970s, Fischer contributed significant money to the Worldwide Church of God. In 1972, one journalist stated that \"Fischer is almost as serious about religion as he is about chess\", and the champion credited his faith with greatly improving his chess. Yet prophecies by Herbert W. Armstrong went unfulfilled. Fischer eventually left the church in 1977, \"accusing it of being 'satanic', and vigorously attacking its methods and leadership\".\n\nFischer made numerous antisemitic statements and professed a general hatred for Jews since at least the early 1960s. Jan Hein Donner wrote that at the time of Bled 1961, \"He idolized Hitler and read everything about him that he could lay his hands on. He also championed a brand of anti-semitism that could only be thought up by a mind completely cut off from reality.\" Donner took Fischer to a war museum, which \"left a great impression, since [Fischer] is not an evil person, and afterwards he was more restrained in his remarks—to me, at least.\"\n\nFrom the 1980s on, Fischer's comments about Jews were a major theme in his public and private remarks. He openly denied the Holocaust, and called the United States \"a farce controlled by dirty, hook-nosed, circumcised Jew bastards\". Between 1999 and 2006, Fischer's primary means of communicating with the public was radio interviews. He participated in at least 34 such broadcasts, mostly with radio stations in the Philippines, but also in Hungary, Iceland, Colombia, and Russia. In 1999, he gave a radio call-in interview to a station in Budapest, Hungary, during which he described himself as the \"victim of an international Jewish conspiracy\". In another radio interview, Fischer said that it became clear to him in 1977, after reading \"The Secret World Government\" by Count Cherep-Spiridovich, that Jewish agencies were targeting him. Fischer's sudden reemergence was apparently triggered when some of his belongings, which had been stored in a Pasadena, California, storage unit, were sold by the landlord, who claimed it was in response to nonpayment of rent. Fischer was also upset that UBS bank had liquidated his assets and closed his account without his permission. When asked who he thought was responsible for the actions UBS had taken Fischer replied, \"There's no question that the Jew-controlled United States is behind this—that's obvious.\"\n\nFischer's library contained antisemitic and racist literature such as \"Mein Kampf\", \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\", and \"The White Man's Bible\" and \"Nature's Eternal Religion\" by Ben Klassen, founder of the World Church of the Creator. A notebook written by Fischer contains sentiments such as \"12/13/99 It's time to start randomly killing Jews\". Despite his views, Fischer remained on good terms with Jewish chess players.\n\nAfter the 1992 match with Spassky, Fischer, now a fugitive, slid back into relative obscurity, taking up residence in Budapest, Hungary, and allegedly having a relationship with young Hungarian chess master Zita Rajcsányi. Fischer stated that standard chess was stale and that he now played blitz games of chess variants, such as Chess960. He visited the Polgár family in Budapest and analyzed many games with Judit, Zsuzsa, and Zsófia Polgár. In 1998/99 he also stayed at the house of young Hungarian grandmaster Peter Leko.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2002, Fischer lived in Baguio City in the Philippines, residing in the same compound as the Filipino grandmaster Eugenio Torre, a close friend who had acted as his during his 1992 match with Spassky. Torre introduced Fischer to a 22-year-old woman named Marilyn Young. On May 21, 2001, Marilyn Young gave birth to a daughter named Jinky Young, and claimed that Fischer was the child's father.\n\nShortly after midnight on September 12, 2001, Philippines local time (approximately four hours after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the US), Fischer was interviewed live by Pablo Mercado on the Baguio City station of the Bombo Radyo network. Fischer stated that he was happy that the attacks had happened, while expressing his view on United States and Israeli foreign policy, saying, \"I applaud the act. Look, nobody gets ... that the US and Israel have been slaughtering the Palestinians ... for years.\" He also said, \"The horrible behavior that the US is committing all over the world ... This just shows you, that what goes around, comes around even for the United States.\" Fischer also referenced the movie \"Seven Days in May\" and said he hoped for a military coup d'état in the US, \"[I hope] the country will be taken over by the military—they'll close down all the synagogues, arrest all the Jews, execute hundreds of thousands of Jewish ringleaders.\" In response to Fischer's statements about 9/11, the US Chess Federation passed a motion to cancel his right to membership in the organization. Fischer's right to become a member was reinstated in 2007.\n\nFischer lived for a time in Japan. On July 13, 2004, acting in response to a letter from US officials, Japanese immigration authorities arrested him at Narita International Airport near Tokyo for allegedly using a revoked US passport while trying to board a Japan Airlines flight to Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, Philippines. Fischer resisted arrest, and claimed to have sustained bruises, cuts and a broken tooth in the process. At the time, Fischer had a passport (originally issued in 1997 and updated in 2003 to add more pages) that, according to US officials, had been revoked in November 2003 due to his outstanding arrest-warrant for the Yugoslavia sanctions violation. Despite the outstanding arrest-warrant in the US, Fischer said that he believed the passport was still valid. The authorities held Fischer at a custody center for 16 days before transferring him to another facility. Fischer said that his cell was windowless and he had not seen the light of day during that period, and that the staff had ignored his complaints about constant tobacco smoke in his cell.\n\nTokyo-based Canadian journalist and consultant John Bosnitch set up the \"Committee to Free Bobby Fischer\" after meeting Fischer at Narita Airport and offering to assist him. Boris Spassky wrote a letter to US President George W. Bush, asking \"For mercy, charity\", and, if that was not possible, \"to put [him] in the same cell with Bobby Fischer\" and \"to give [them] a chess set\". It was reported that Fischer and Miyoko Watai, the President of the Japanese Chess Association (with whom he had reportedly been living since 2000) wanted to become legally married. (It was also reported that Fischer had been living in the Philippines with Marilyn Young during the same period.) Fischer applied for German citizenship on the grounds that his father was German. Fischer stated that he wanted to renounce his US citizenship, and appealed to US Secretary of State Colin Powell to help him do so, though to no effect. Japan's Justice Minister rejected Fischer's request for asylum and ordered his deportation.\n\nSeeking ways to evade deportation to the United States, Fischer wrote a letter to the government of Iceland in early January 2005, requesting Icelandic citizenship. Sympathetic to Fischer's plight, but reluctant to grant him the full benefits of citizenship, Icelandic authorities granted him an alien's passport. When this proved insufficient for the Japanese authorities, the Althing (the Icelandic Parliament), at the behest of William Lombardy, agreed unanimously to grant Fischer full citizenship in late March for humanitarian reasons, as they felt he was being unjustly treated by the United States and Japanese governments, and also in recognition of his 1972 match, which had \"put Iceland on the map\".\n\nAfter arriving in Reykjavík, Fischer gave a press conference. He lived a reclusive life in Iceland, avoiding entrepreneurs and others who approached him with various proposals.\n\nFischer moved into an apartment in the same building as his close friend and spokesman, Garðar Sverrisson. Garðar's wife, Kristín Þórarinsdóttir, was a nurse and later looked after Fischer as a terminally ill patient. Garðar's two children, especially his son, were very close to Fischer. Fischer also developed a friendship with Magnús Skúlason, a psychiatrist and chess player who later recalled long discussions with him on a wide variety of subjects.\n\nOn December 10, 2006, Fischer telephoned an Icelandic television station that had just broadcast a chess game in which one player blundered such that his opponent was able to mate on the next move. Although he tried to change his mind upon seeing the mate, the touch-move rule forced him to play the blunder. Fischer pointed out a winning combination that could have been played instead of the blunder or the other attempted move, but had been missed by the player and commentators.\n\nIn 2005, some of Fischer's belongings were auctioned on eBay. Fischer claimed, in 2006, that the belongings sold in the US without his permission were worth \"hundreds of millions of [US] dollars; even billions of dollars.\" In the same interview, Fischer also said that UBS Bank had closed an account of his and liquidated his assets against his wishes, transferring the funds to a bank in Iceland.\n\nOn January 17, 2008, Fischer died at age 64 from kidney failure at the Landspítali Hospital (National University Hospital of Iceland) in Reykjavík. He had been suffering from degenerative kidney failure. He originally had a urinary tract blockage but refused surgery or medication. Magnús Skúlason reported Fischer's response to leg massages: \"Nothing soothes as much as the human touch.\"\n\nOn January 21, Fischer was buried in the small Christian cemetery of Laugardælir church, outside the town of Selfoss, southeast of Reykjavík, after a Catholic funeral presided over by Fr. Jakob Rolland of the diocese of Reykjavík. In accordance with Fischer's wishes, only Miyoko Watai, Garðar Sverrisson, and Garðar's family were present.\n\nFischer's estate was estimated at 140 million ISK (about 1 million GBP, or US$2 million). It quickly became the object of a legal battle involving claims from four parties, with Miyoko Watai ultimately inheriting what remained of Fischer's estate after government claims. The four parties were Fischer's Japanese wife Miyoko Watai; his alleged Filipino daughter Jinky Young and her mother Marilyn Young; his two American nephews Alexander and Nicholas Targ and their father Russell Targ; and the US government (claiming unpaid taxes).\n\nMarilyn Young claimed that Jinky was Fischer's daughter, citing as evidence Jinky's birth and baptismal certificates, photographs, a transaction record dated December 4, 2007, of a bank remittance by Fischer to Jinky, and Jinky's DNA through her blood samples. However, Magnús Skúlason, a friend of Fischer's, said that he was certain that Fischer was not the girl's father. In addition, the validity of Miyoko Watai's marriage to Fischer was challenged.\n\nOn June 16, 2010, Iceland's supreme court ruled in favor of a petition on behalf of Jinky Young to have Fischer's remains exhumed. The exhumation was performed on July 5, 2010, in the presence of a doctor, a priest, and other officials. A DNA sample was taken and Fischer's body was then reburied.\n\nOn August 17, 2010, it was announced that results of DNA testing had ruled out Fischer as the father of Jinky Young. On March 3, 2011, an Icelandic district court ruled that Miyoko Watai and Fischer had married on September 6, 2004, and that, as Fischer's widow and heir, Watai was therefore entitled to inherit Fischer's estate. Fischer's nephews were ordered to pay Watai's legal costs, amounting to ISK 6.6 million (approximately $57,000).\n\nWhile as far as is known Fischer was never formally diagnosed, there has been widespread comment and speculation concerning his psychological condition based on his extreme views and unusual behavior. Reuben Fine, psychologist and chess player, who met Fischer many times, said that \"Some of Bobby's behavior is so strange, unpredictable, odd and bizarre that even his most ardent apologists have had a hard time explaining what makes him tick\" and described him as \"a troubled human being\" with \"obvious personal problems\".\n\nValery Krylov, advisor to Anatoly Karpov and a specialist in the \"psycho-physiological rehabilitation of sportsmen\", believed Fischer suffered from schizophrenia. Psychologist Joseph G. Ponterotto, from second-hand sources, concludes that \"Bobby did not meet all the necessary criteria to reach diagnoses of schizophrenia or Asperger syndrome. The evidence is stronger for paranoid personality disorder.\" Magnús Skúlason, a chess player, psychiatrist and head doctor of Sogn Mental Asylum for the Criminally Insane, befriended Fischer towards the end of Fischer's life. From \"Endgame\", Fischer's 2011 biography by Frank Brady:\n\n[...] Skulason was not \"Bobby's psychiatrist\", as has been implied in the general press, nor did he offer Bobby any analysis or psychotherapy. He was at Bobby's bedside as a friend, to try to do anything he could for him. Because of his training, however, he couldn't fail to take note of Bobby's mental condition. \"He definitely was not schizophrenic\", Skulason said. \"He had problems, possibly certain childhood traumas that had affected him. He was misunderstood. Underneath I think he was a caring sensitive person.\"\n\n\nFischer's opening repertoire was narrow in some ways. As White, Fischer almost exclusively played 1.e4 throughout his career. He played 1.d4 with White only once in a serious game, during a blitz tournament. In spite of this narrowness, he was considered by some of his rivals to be unpredictable in his opening play, and a difficult opponent to prepare for.\n\nAs Black, Fischer would usually play the Najdorf Sicilian against 1.e4, and the King's Indian Defense against 1.d4, only rarely venturing into the Nimzo-Indian (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4), Benoni, Grünfeld or Neo-Grünfeld. Fischer acknowledged difficulty playing against the of the French Defense (1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4), but maintained that the Winawer was unsound because it exposed Black's kingside, and that, in his view, \"Black was trading off his good bishop with 3...Bb4 and ...Bxc3.\" Later on Fischer said: \"I may yet be forced to admit that the Winawer is sound. But I doubt it! The defense is anti-positional and weakens the K-side.\"\n\nFischer was renowned for his opening preparation and made numerous contributions to chess opening theory. He was one of the foremost experts on the Ruy Lopez. A line of the Exchange Variation (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Bxc6 dxc6 5.0-0) is sometimes called the \"Fischer Variation\" after he successfully resurrected it at the 1966 Havana Olympiad. Fischer's lifetime score with the move 5.0-0 in tournament and match games was eight wins, three draws, and no losses (86.36%).\n\nFischer was a recognized expert in the black side of the Najdorf Sicilian and the King's Indian Defense. He used the Grünfeld Defense and Neo-Grünfeld Defense to win his celebrated games against Donald and Robert Byrne, and played a theoretical novelty in the Grünfeld against reigning world champion Mikhail Botvinnik, refuting Botvinnik's prepared analysis . In the Nimzo-Indian Defense, the line beginning with 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3 b6 5.Ne2 Ba6 was named after him.\n\nFischer established the viability of the so-called Poisoned Pawn Variation of the Najdorf Sicilian (1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.Bg5 e6 7.f4 Qb6). This bold queen sortie, to snatch a pawn at the expense of development, had been considered dubious, but Fischer succeeded in proving its soundness. Out of ten tournament and match games as Black in the Poisoned Pawn, Fischer scored 70%, winning five, drawing four, and losing only one: the 11th game of his 1972 match against Spassky. Following Fischer's use, the Poisoned Pawn Variation became a respected line, utilized by many of the world's leading players. Fischer's 10.f5 in this line against Efim Geller quickly became the main line of the Poisoned Pawn.\n\nOn the white side of the Sicilian, Fischer made advances to the theory of the line beginning 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 (or e6) 6.Bc4, which has sometimes been named after him.\n\nIn 1961, prompted by a loss the year before to Spassky, Fischer wrote an article titled \"A to the King's Gambit\" for the first issue of the \"American Chess Quarterly\", in which he stated, \"In my opinion, the King's Gambit is busted. It loses by force.\" Fischer recommended 1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 d6, which has since become known as the Fischer Defense, as a refutation to the King's Gambit. Fischer later played the King's Gambit as White in three tournament games, winning them all.\n\nFischer had excellent endgame technique. International Master Jeremy Silman listed him as one of the five best endgame players (along with Emanuel Lasker, Akiba Rubinstein, José Raúl Capablanca and Vasily Smyslov), calling Fischer a \"master of bishop endings\". The endgame of a rook, bishop, and pawns against a rook, knight, and pawns has sometimes been called the \"Fischer Endgame\" because of several instructive wins by Fischer (with the bishop), including three against Mark Taimanov in 1970 and 1971.\n\nIn 1988, Fischer filed for for a new type of chess clock, which gave each player a fixed period at the start of the game and then added a small increment after each completed move.\n\nAn example of Fischer's patented clock was made for, and used in, the 1992 rematch between Fischer and Spassky. Clocks based on the \"Fischer clock\" soon became standard in major chess tournaments. Fischer would later complain that he was cheated out of the royalties for this invention.\n\nFischer heavily disparaged chess as it was currently being played (at the highest levels). As a result, on June 19, 1996, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Fischer announced and advocated a variant of chess called Fischerandom Chess (later also known as Chess960). The goal of Fischerandom Chess was to ensure that a game between two players is a contest between their understandings of chess, rather than their abilities to prepare opening strategies or memorize opening lines.\n\nKasparov calls Fischer \"perhaps the most mythologically shrouded figure in chess\". Some leading players and some of Fischer's biographers have ranked him as the greatest player who ever lived. Other writers have said that he was arguably the greatest player ever, without reaching a definitive conclusion. Leonard Barden wrote, \"Most experts place him the second or third best ever, behind Kasparov but probably ahead of Karpov.\"\n\nSome grandmasters compared Fischer's play to that of a computer; a player without noticeable weaknesses.\n\nFischer's great rival Mikhail Tal praised him as \"the greatest genius to have descended from the chess heavens\". American grandmaster Arthur Bisguier wrote \"Robert James Fischer is one of the few people in any sphere of endeavour who has been accorded the accolade of being called a legend in his own time.\" Former World Champion Tigran Petrosian stated that Fischer put more time into chess than the entire Soviet team.\n\nBiographers David Edmonds and John Eidinow wrote:\n\nFaced with Fischer's extraordinary coolness, his opponents [sic] assurance would begin to disintegrate. A Fischer move, which at first glances looked weak, would be reassessed. It must have a deep master plan behind it, undetectable by mere mortals (more often than not they were right, it did). The US grandmaster Robert Byrne labeled the phenomenon \"Fischer-fear\". Grandmasters would wilt, their suits would crumple, sweat would glisten on their brows, panic would overwhelm their nervous systems. Errors would creep in. Calculations would go awry. There was talk among grandmasters that Fischer hypnotized his opponents, that he undermined their intellectual powers with a dark, mystic, insidious force.\n\nKasparov wrote that Fischer \"became the detonator of an avalanche of new chess ideas, a revolutionary whose revolution is still in progress\". In January 2009, reigning World Champion Viswanathan Anand described him as \"the greatest chess player who ever lived\". Serbian grandmaster Ljubomir Ljubojević called Fischer, \"A man without frontiers. He didn't divide the East and the West, he brought them together in their admiration of him.\"\n\nGerman grandmaster Karsten Müller wrote:\n\nFischer, who had taken the highest crown almost singlehandedly from the mighty, almost invincible Soviet chess empire, shook the whole world, not only the chess world, to its core. He started a chess boom not only in the United States and in the Western hemisphere, but worldwide. Teaching chess or playing chess as a career had truly become a respectable profession. After Bobby, the game was simply not the same.\n\nFischer won the Chess Oscar (an award, started in 1967, given to the best chess player, determined through votes from chess media and leading players) for 1970, 1971, and 1972.\n\nFischer was a charter inductee into the US Chess Hall of Fame in Washington, D.C. in 1985. After routing Taimanov, Larsen, and Petrosian in 1971, Fischer achieved a then-record Elo rating of 2785. After beating Spassky by the score 12½–8½ in their 1972 match, his rating dropped to 2780.\n\nSt. Louis philanthropist Rex Sinquefield offered a $64,000 \"Fischer Memorial Prize\" for any player who could win all nine of their games at the 2009 US Chess Championship. By the fifth day of the championship, all 24 participants became ineligible for the prize, having drawn or lost at least one game.\n\n(Rapid, blitz and blindfold games not included; listed as +wins −losses =draws.)<br>\n\n\nIn 2001, Nigel Short wrote in \"The Sunday Telegraph\" chess column that he believed he had been secretly playing Fischer on the Internet Chess Club (ICC) in speed chess matches. Subsequently others claimed to have played Fischer as well.\nFischer denied ownership of the account.\n\n\n\nThe 1955 US Amateur Championship was the first tournament organized by the US Chess Federation in which Fischer entered. Before this tournament, he had played in the Brooklyn Chess Club Championships, in some tournaments organized by the Brooklyn YMCA Chess and Checker Club, and in a correspondence chess tournament organized by \"Chess Review\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1957, it grants both undergraduate and graduate degrees, and is one of the university's nine constituent schools. Since 1998, the school has been named in honor of Georgetown alumnus Robert Emmett McDonough.\n\nThe school was founded in 1957 as an outgrowth of the School of Foreign Service, and was originally named the Georgetown University School of Business Administration. In 1993, the name was changed to the Georgetown University School of Business. On October 7, 1998, the School of Business was renamed the Robert Emmett McDonough School of Business in honor of alumnus Robert Emmett McDonough (a 1949 graduate of the School of Foreign Service) in honor of his $30 million donation to the school.\n\nIn 2009 the McDonough School of Business moved into the newly constructed Rafik B. Hariri Building, named after the late Rafik Hariri, former Prime Minister of Lebanon and father of Georgetown alumnus Saad Hariri, also a former Prime Minister of Lebanon. The $82.5-million privately funded building opened in the summer of 2009. The new building includes 15 classrooms, eight case-style rooms, five tiered lecture rooms, and two flat-floor rooms; 34 breakout rooms complete with data ports, flat-screen video monitors, and white boards; separate undergraduate and graduate commons areas and lockers for graduate students; 120 faculty offices; 11 interview rooms within the Career Management Office; 15 conference rooms throughout the building; and a 400-seat auditorium, among other features.\n\nSeveral academic themes distinguish the McDonough School of Business and give the school a special identity among managers and academicians, including international and intercultural dimensions of the marketplace, the importance of written and oral communication, and interpersonal effectiveness in organizations. As a Catholic and Jesuit university, Georgetown stresses ethics and social justice in its curriculum.\n\nThe Georgetown Institute for Consumer Research is one of several academic research centers at the McDonough School of Business.\n\nThe McDonough School of Business is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business.\n\nUndergraduates work toward a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA). The curriculum combines business and liberal arts courses to provide a strong foundation in critical thinking and reasoning. The primary academic emphasis during the first and second years is the liberal arts, notably economics, government, history, philosophy, English, calculus, and theology. Coursework usually shifts to mostly business courses in the junior and senior years, but this can vary depending on how a student constructs his or her schedule. Students must complete both 40 courses and 120 semester hours of liberal arts courses, business core courses, courses supporting a major or minor, and free electives.\n\nThe McDonough School of Business has core courses in the traditional disciplines of accounting, finance, marketing, management, and the decision sciences support these themes. Additionally these themes are supported by the school's strong support of minor concentrations among nearly 50 liberal arts disciplines. About one third of undergraduates choose to double major. Undergraduate concentrations include accounting, finance, two separate majors related to international business, management, marketing, and operations and information management (OPIM). The McDonough School's undergraduate acceptance rate in the 2009-2010 cycle (for the class of 2014) was 22 percent, but this dropped to 15.7 percent for the 2014-2015 cycle (class of 2019), where the school accepted 530 applicants out of roughly 3,375 applicants. In the 2013-2014 admission cycle (for the class of 2018), the 25th and 75th percentiles of the admitted students' SAT scores were 650 and 750 for Critical Reading, and 690 and 770 for Mathematics, respectively.\n\nThe largest employers of new McDonough School of Business alumni include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan, Barclays Capital, Pricewaterhouse Coopers, Deloitte, Bank of America, IBM, and Citigroup. Students also pursue professional degrees, such as Juris Doctor, immediately after graduating.\n\nThe Undergraduate Program Office and active students provide dozens of activities and groups. Some well-known activities include the Georgetown University Student Investment Fund, Georgetown University Accounting Society, Innovo Consulting, Hilltop Consultants, Alpha Kappa Psi Professional Business Fraternity, Young Alumni Mentor Program, Stock Pitch Competition, and several other activities.\n\nStudents work for a variety of skill-based jobs on campus, such as in accounting or finance department of student groups and companies (such as The Corp, \"The Hoya\", and the Georgetown University Alumni & Student Federal Credit Union), the University Investment Office, the MSB Tech Center, and University Information Services. Many students also have internships in the Washington, DC area, usually about 8–12 hours per week, at private equity, investment management, and accounting firms, or other companies including startups. Given the school’s D.C. location, students also have the opportunity to intern with government agencies. \n\nThe school also offers six-week summer study-abroad programs tailored specifically for business students at the University of Oxford, Sophia University in Tokyo, and the ESADE Business School.\n\nGraduate work offered by the school includes a day and evening Master of Business Administration (MBA) programs, two Global Executive MBA programs (one weekend format and one modular), a Master of Science in Finance (MSF) program, a Master of Science in Management and an Executive Master's in Leadership degree.\n\nThe Georgetown MBA Full-time Program is a general management program oriented toward those with liberal arts, science, or technical undergraduate degrees. Students who enroll in the 60-credit program typically are mid-level managers with an average of five years of work experience. During the course of the 21-month program, students are required to participate in four one-week residences, of which one is international. Joint degrees are offered combining the MBA with JD, MD, Masters in Public Policy, or Masters of Science in Foreign Service.\n\nFor the class of 2019, 34% of enrolled students are of international origin and 77% have lived, worked, or studied abroad. The fields most represented by applicants were finance, consulting, and technology, respectively. There were 1,742 applicants and 276 were enrolled.\n\nThe MBA Full-time Program has often been ranked among the top 25 business programs by many leading publications, including BusinessWeek, USNews, Financial Times, and many others.\n\nThe \"MBA Evening Program\" (EP) is designed for the working professional. The 60-credit program is taught by the same faculty as the MBA Full-Time Program and covers the same academic content in three years. In its 2015 ranking, Bloomberg BusinessWeek ranked the MBA Evening Program #4 in the nation.\n\nThe \"Master of Science in Finance\" graduate program is technology-intensive, with a duration of 21-months, requisites of 32-34 credits and is accredited by the Advanced Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). The program is intended to prepare the next global leaders of finance, via challenging quantitative academic coursework, a required graduation GPA of at least a 3.0, an on-campus residency, an optional 2- month summer consulting and/or investment clinic, as well as a mandatory global consulting project. One of the past locations for the global consulting project has been Johannesburg, South Africa. In the past, firms such as Barclays, Deloitte, Blink Consulting, Standard Chartered, Coca-Cola and the World Bank, have partnered with the program to offer consulting project opportunities to students.\n\nProgram coursework encompasses Corporate Finance, Financial Markets, Econometrics, Real Estate Private Equity, Big and Small Data, Fixed Income Investments, Advanced Valuation and Modeling, Financial Statement Analysis, as well as Options Pricing and Risk Management.\n\nGeorgetown's McDonough School of Business offers Executive MBA programs that are characterized by small class sizes and cohort relationships. The \"Global Executive MBA program\" (previously the International Executive MBA program - IEMBA) provides experienced professionals with the tools needed to excel in today's global business environment by combining classroom teaching with international residencies. The every-alternate-weekend class structure means students can stay on the job, immediately putting their new knowledge to work. The \"Georgetown-ESADE Global Executive MBA\" for highly accomplished managers and executives is offered in partnership with the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University and the ESADE Business School in Spain. The program consists of six 11-day modules in Washington, D.C., Barcelona, São Paulo, Buenos Aires, Bangalore, Moscow, and New York. The Executive Master's in Leadership degree is a distinctive, 13-month program that emphasizes leadership in organizations with a focus on identifying and developing the leadership capabilities of individuals. The master's program analyzes leadership as a set of skills on three different levels of analysis: \"individual\", \"interpersonal\", and \"institutional\".\n\nGeorgetown's McDonough School of Business claims more than 10,500 undergraduate alumni and approximately 5,000 MBA and several hundred Executive MBA alumni.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2073576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073576", "title": "Polychelidae", "text": "Polychelidae\n\nThe family Polychelidae contains thirty-eight extant species of blind, benthic lobster-like crustaceans. They are found throughout the world's tropical, sub-tropical and temperate oceans, including the Mediterranean Sea and the Irish Sea.\n\nThe family Polychelidae is notable for the number of chelate (clawed) limbs, with either four or all five pairs of pereiopods bearing claws. This gives rise to the scientific names \"Polycheles\" (many-clawed) and \"Pentacheles\" (five claws). The first pair of periopods are greatly elongated, but often become broken off while specimens are being brought to the surface. The rostrum is very short or absent, and, although eyestalks are present, the eyes are absent. This family can be seen as evidence of the transition from shrimp-like animals to lobster-like animals, since they possess a number of primitive characters (plesiomorphies), such as the pointed telson, in contrast to the rounded telson in lobsters.\n\nAlthough apparently widespread, and at least locally common, they were first discovered only in the late nineteenth century when they were dredged up by the \"Challenger\" expedition from a depth supposed to be \"\"barren, if not of all life, certainly of animals so high in the scale of existence\"\" (Charles Spence Bate). Their kinship with the fossil group Eryonoidea, including well-known genera such as \"Eryon\", was immediately recognised. Since \"Eryon\" and its relatives were only known from fossils, lastly in the Jurassic, this made the Polychelidae something of a living fossil.\n\nThe reason that polychelids remained unknown for so long is that they live on the sea-floor, often at great depths; the family as a whole has a depth range from less than to over . This also accounts for the lack of eyesight, since almost none of the sun's light penetrates to such abyssal depths.\n\nA single fossil species is known, \"Antarcticheles antarcticus\", which was found in Jurassic sediments on James Ross Island, close to the Prince Gustav Channel.\n\nThe larvae of polychelids are very distinctive, and were first described under the name \"Eryoneicus\". Over forty different larval forms are known, although few can be ascribed to known adult species.\n\n"}
{"id": "2073577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073577", "title": "Andy Sandham", "text": "Andy Sandham\n\nAndrew Sandham (6 July 1890 – 20 April 1982) was an English cricketer, a right-handed batsman who played 14 Test matches between 1921 and 1930. Sandham made the first triple century in Test cricket, 325 against the West Indies in 1930, and scored over 40,000 first-class runs.\n\nBorn in Streatham, London, Sandham made his Surrey debut in 1911, and was capped in 1913. In his 26 years at the county Sandham formed a formidable opening partnership with Jack Hobbs, and the two put on a hundred for the first wicket on 66 occasions, the highest of these the 428 they accumulated against Oxford University in 1926. He passed 2,000 runs in eight seasons, and during the middle part of his career between 1924 and 1931 averaged above 50 in all but two years. He scored an unbeaten 292 against Northants, being denied his triple century only by Percy Fender's declaration, and still holds three record Surrey partnerships, including the 173 he put on with Andy Ducat for the 10th wicket at Leyton after suffering a bout of food poisoning.\n\nSandham made his England debut in 1921 against Australia, inching his way to 21 in 81 minutes before being bowled by a 'snorter' from Ted McDonald. He went to South Africa in 1922–23 but made only one half-century in his nine innings, and though he was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1923, he again failed to make much of an impression either against the South Africans in 1924 or in Australia the following winter. In 1924 Herbert Sutcliffe made his Test debut, and his success as Hobbs' opening partner restricted Sandham's opportunities subsequently. He played only five innings against Australia during his career and thought that the greatest regret of his career. Sandham went to South Africa in 1926–27 and scored heavily in the matches against domestic opposition, averaging above 60, but was not picked for any of the Tests.\n\nHowever, he did play in the Caribbean series in 1929–30, and it was here that he achieved his greatest fame. In the first Test at Bridgetown he made 152 and 51. In the next two games he failed completely, making 0 and 5 at Port of Spain and then 9 and 0 at Georgetown. In the fourth and final Test at Kingston, however, he became the first Test triple-centurion when he compiled a mammoth 325 out of England's equally imposing total of 849, beating R. E. Foster's individual Test score record of 287, which had stood for twenty-seven years. The theoretically timeless match was in fact abandoned as a draw after nine days, but Sandham had still had time to make 50 in the second innings; he had scored 592 runs in the series. His aggregate of 375 in the match stood as the Test record until Greg Chappell eclipsed it. He made the runs with a long-handled bat borrowed from his captain Freddie Calthorpe and a pair of ill-fitting boots borrowed from Patsy Hendren. At 39 years and 272 days, he is, by almost five years, the oldest player to break the individual scoring record in Tests.\nSandham went to South Africa with MCC in 1930/31. He broke a bone in his ankle in a motor accident in Durban in December. It required a small operation and ended his tour after two first-class matches. The Kingston Test was therefore to be Sandham's final match at Test level, and his 325 is by some distance the highest score in a final Test match.\n\nHe continued to appear regularly for Surrey for a number of years, scoring 219 against the touring Australians in 1934, a record for a county player against that opposition. He recorded his hundredth first-class hundred in 1935 on a damp pitch at Basingstoke, reaching the milestone with 'a flick behind square'. He made 239 against Glamorgan as late as June 1937, only a month short of his 47th birthday. He scored 102 in his final match in England, against Sussex at Hove, but had an unusual end to his career, playing three games at Buenos Aires for Sir TEW Brinkman's XI against Argentina in 1937–38. These matches were designated as first-class, and so he ended with a whimper, not reaching 30 in any of his six innings in South America.\n\nAfter the war, Sandham returned to Surrey as coach and delighted in the county's seven successive County Championship titles in the 1950s, later becoming the club's scorer. He died in 1982 in Westminster, London. He was a Catholic.\n"}
{"id": "2073580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073580", "title": "Toronto Pearson International Airport", "text": "Toronto Pearson International Airport\n\nLester B. Pearson International Airport , branded as Toronto Pearson International Airport (simply known as Toronto Pearson, Pearson Airport or Pearson), is the primary international airport serving Toronto, its metropolitan area, and its surrounding region known as the Golden Horseshoe. It is the largest and busiest airport in Canada, the second-busiest international air passenger gateway in the Americas, and the 30th-busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic, handling 50.5 million passengers in 2019. The airport is named in honour of Lester B. Pearson, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and 14th Prime Minister of Canada.\n\nToronto Pearson is located northwest of Downtown Toronto with the majority of the airport situated in the city of Mississauga and a small portion of the airfield extending into Toronto's western district of Etobicoke. It features five runways and two passenger terminals along with numerous cargo and maintenance facilities on a site that covers .\n\nToronto Pearson is the primary hub for Air Canada and is among that airline's four hubs. It also serves as a hub for WestJet, cargo airline FedEx Express, and as a base of operations for Air Transat and Sunwing Airlines. Pearson is operated by the Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA) as part of Transport Canada's National Airports System, and is the largest airport in the world with facilities for United States border preclearance.\n\nAn extensive network of non-stop domestic flights is operated from Toronto Pearson by several airlines to all major and many secondary cities across all provinces of Canada. As of 2019, over 75 airlines operate around 1,250 daily departures from the airport to more than 180 destinations across all six of the world's inhabited continents.\n\nIn 1937, the Government of Canada agreed to support the building of two airports in the Toronto area. One site selected was on the Toronto Islands, which is the present-day Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport. The other site selected was an area northwest of Toronto near the town of Malton, which was originally intended to serve as an alternate to the downtown airport but instead would become its successor. The first scheduled passenger flight at the \"Malton Airport\" was a Trans-Canada Air Lines DC-3 that landed on August 29, 1939. Since Toronto has more than one airport, YTO is used for the area designation, while Pearson is coded YYZ, Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport is YTZ and Toronto/Buttonville Municipal Airport is YKZ. YZ was the code for the station in Malton, Ontario, where Pearson Airport is located and hence the IATA code for Pearson Airport is YYZ. The telegraph station in Toronto itself was coded TZ, which is why Toronto's smaller City Centre Airport is coded YTZ. \nDuring World War II, the Royal Canadian Air Force established a base at the airport as a component of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. \"RCAF Station Malton\" was home to several training schools and was in operation between 1940 and 1946.\n\nIn 1958, the municipal government of Toronto sold the Malton Airport to the Government of Canada, which subsequently changed the name of the facility to \"Toronto International Airport\", under the management of Transport Canada. The airport was officially renamed \"Lester B. Pearson International Airport\" in 1984, in honour of Toronto-born Lester B. Pearson, the fourteenth Prime Minister of Canada and recipient of the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize. The Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA) assumed management, operation, and control of the airport in 1996, and has used the name \"Toronto Pearson International Airport\" for the facility since the transition.\n\nToronto Pearson International Airport has two active public terminals, Terminal 1 and Terminal 3. Both terminals are designed to handle all three sectors of travel (domestic, transborder, and international), which results in terminal operations at Pearson being grouped for airlines and airline alliances, rather than for domestic and international routes.\n\nA third public terminal, the Infield Concourse (IFC), currently acts as an extension of Terminal 3 providing additional bridged gates.\n\nTerminal 2 was permanently closed and demolished in 2007, replaced by an expanded Terminal 1.\n\nMeasuring over , Terminal 1 is the largest airport terminal in Canada and the 12th largest in the world by floor space. Air Canada and all other Star Alliance airlines that serve Pearson are based at Terminal 1. Emirates is the only non-alliance airline that uses the terminal.\n\nTerminal 1 was designed by a joint venture known as Airports Architects Canada made up of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP, Adamson Associates Architects and Moshe Safdie and Associates. It contains 58 gates: D1, D3, D5, D7-D12, D20, D22, D24, D26, D28, D31–D45 (D32, D34, D36 also serve US flights and carry F designation), D51, D53, D55, D57 (also carry F designation), F60–F63, F64A–F64B, F65, F66A–F66B, F/E67–F/E81 (F68-F73 and F78-F81 serve both US and international flights but E74-E77 are international only), F59, F82-F83, and F84-F99. Two of the gates, E73 and E75, can accommodate the Airbus A380.\n\nAlong with the standard customs and immigration facilities, Terminal 1 also contains special customs \"B\" checkpoints along the international arrivals walkway. Passengers connecting from an international or trans-border arrival to another international (non-U.S.) departure in Terminal 1 go to one of these checkpoints for passport control and immigration checks, then are immediately directed to Pier E for departure. This alleviates the need to recheck bags, pass through security screening, and relieves congestion in the primary customs hall. International-to-domestic passengers use the same corridor and a bus for one-stop security procedures, which avoids having to re-clear security if coming from another country with a mutual agreement.\n\nThe terminal has a total of eight lounges, with five of the lounges being Air Canada operated lounges (3 Maple Leaf Lounges, one Maple Leaf Express Lounge and one Signature Suite) and three being Plaza Premium operated. Both Air Canada and Plaza Premium have lounges in the Domestic, International and Transborder zones, with the Signature Suite being in the International Zone.\n\nIn addition to the eight lounges, Air Canada operates the Air Canada Cafe, in which premium passengers have the ability to enter into the zone and get premium coffee and grab and go snacks.\n\nAn eight-level parking garage with 8,400 public parking spaces (including 700 rental car spaces) across from Terminal 1 is connected to the terminal by several elevated and enclosed pedestrian walkways.\n\nTerminal 1 is home to the ThyssenKrupp Express Walkway, the world's fastest moving walkway.\n\nTerminal 3 is a facility designed by B+H Architects and Scott Associates Architects Inc. It is used by all SkyTeam and Oneworld airlines that serve Pearson, along with Air Transat, Etihad Airways, Pakistan International Airlines, Philippine Airlines, Sunwing Airlines, WestJet and all other airlines that are unaffiliated with an airline alliance (except Emirates, which uses Terminal 1). Terminal 3 has 46 gates: B1a-B1d, B2a, B2c, B3-B5, A6d-A6f, A7–A16, B17-B20 (also, A17-A20 for transborder flights), B22-B29, C30-C36 and B37–B41.\n\nA five-level parking garage with 3,800 public parking spaces (including 600 rental car spaces) is located directly across from the terminal along with the Sheraton Hotel, both of which are connected to Terminal 3 by an elevated pedestrian walkway.\n\nSince June 2018, the GTAA has used the Infield Terminal to act as an extension of Terminal 3 to provide additional bridged gates. Passengers on flights arriving or departing from gates at the Infield Terminal are transported by bus to/from Terminal 3.\n\nThe Infield Concourse (IFC) was originally built to handle traffic displaced during the development and construction of the current Terminal 1. Its 11 gates (521 to 531) were opened gradually throughout 2002 and 2003, and a business lounge was opened in 2005. In 2009, the Infield Concourse was closed for regular operations in conjunction with the official opening of the newly constructed Terminal 1. However, the GTAA retained plans to reactivate the IFC for regular operations whenever necessary to accommodate seasonal or overflow demand.\n\nThe terminal was substantially renovated in late 2015 to serve as a dedicated terminal for incoming government-sponsored refugees of the Syrian Civil War. Further renovations were completed at the Infield Concourse in early 2018 and on June 5, 2018, the terminal was reactivated for summer operations by the GTAA to act as an extension of Terminal 3 with the purpose of providing required additional bridged gates. Passengers are transported by bus between Terminal 3 and the IFC. Effective December 2019, Sunwing Airlines moved their operations from terminal 3 to the IFC.\n\nDue to its intermittent usage for passenger traffic, the Infield Concourse is frequently used as a location to film major motion pictures and television productions.\n\nSkyservice FBO operates an private VIP terminal at Toronto Pearson on Midfield Road in the infield area of the airport. The terminal handles most private aircraft arriving and departing at Pearson, providing passenger services that include 24/7 concierge, private customs and immigration facilities, personalized catering, showers, direct handling of baggage, and VIP ground transportation services.\n\nToronto Pearson has five runways, three of which are aligned in the east–west direction, and two in the north–south direction. A large network of taxiways, collectively measuring over in length, provides access between the runways and the passenger terminals, air cargo areas, and airline hangar areas.\n\nToronto Pearson is home to the Toronto Area Control Centre, one of seven area control centres in Canada operated by Nav Canada. The airport uses a Traffic Management Unit (TMU), located in the apron control tower at Terminal 1, to control the movement of aircraft and other airport traffic on the ground. The main air traffic control tower at Pearson is located within the infield operations area of the airport.\n\nThe airfield maintenance unit is responsible for general maintenance and repairs at Pearson. During the winter months, the unit expands into a dedicated 24-hour snow removal team of more than 200 workers tasked with ensuring normal operations at the airport, as Pearson regularly experiences of total snow accumulation in a typical winter season. The airport employs over 94 pieces of snow removal equipment, including 11 Vammas PSB series, 4 Oshkosh HT-Series snowplow units, and 14 snowmelters.\n\nPearson Airport's Central De-icing Facility is the largest in the world, servicing over 10,500 aircraft each winter. The six de-icing bays, covering a total area of , can handle 12 aircraft simultaneously and take between 2 and 19 minutes to de-ice each aircraft dependent on factors such as active weather and aircraft specifications.\n\nThe Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA) Fire and Emergency Service maintains three stations at the airport, with more than 80 firefighters providing fire and rescue operations at Pearson. They are equipped with six crash tenders as well as several pumpers, aerial ladders, and heavy rescue units. The GTAA Fire and Emergency Service operates in conjunction with the \"Fire and Emergency Services Training Institute\" (FESTI), located at the northwest end of the airport grounds.\n\nToronto Pearson handles over 50% of total international air cargo in Canada. The airport has three main cargo facilities, known as Cargo West (Infield), Cargo East (VISTA), and Cargo North (FedEx).\n\nThe Cargo West facility (also known as the Infield Cargo Area) is located between runways 15L/33R and 15R/33L. It is a multi-tenant facility including three large buildings with of warehouse space, a common use cargo apron, vehicle parking, and a truck maneuvering area. A four-lane vehicle tunnel connects the Infield Cargo Area to the passenger terminal area of the airport.\n\nThe Cargo East facility (also known as the VISTA cargo area) is located north of Terminal 3. The VISTA cargo area is a multi-tenant facility of several buildings organised in a U-shape, with of warehouse space and an adjacent common use cargo apron.\n\nThe Cargo North facility is the Canadian hub for FedEx Express. The site occupies an area on the north side of the airport lands near runway 05/23, and is home to two buildings operated exclusively by FedEx with of warehouse space and a dedicated cargo apron.\n\nThe Peel Regional Police is the primary law enforcement agency at Toronto Pearson. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) also maintain a Toronto Airport Detachment at Pearson, which provides federal law enforcement services.\n\nThe Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) is responsible for security screening procedures at Pearson Airport. Other government agencies with security operations at Pearson include the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), and Transport Canada. In addition, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) also conduct operations at the airport to facilitate United States border preclearance.\n\nPearson Airport has seven aircraft maintenance hangars, operated by Air Canada, Air Transat, Westjet, and the GTAA, which are used for line maintenance and routine aircraft inspections. At the north end of the airfield are numerous independently operated hangars for charter aircraft and personal private aircraft based at Pearson, along with passenger and maintenance facilities to service them.\n\nThe Greater Toronto Airports Authority maintains administrative offices on Convair Drive, near the southeast corner of the airfield. Gate Gourmet and CLS Catering Services both operate dedicated flight kitchen facilities at Pearson for airline catering services. Aviation fuel (Jet A-1) is supplied by Esso Avitat and Shell Aerocentre, both located in the infield operations area of the airport.\n\nSeveral public transit bus services operate bus routes to Toronto Pearson International Airport. Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) operates daily, 24-hour public transit bus service from Pearson Airport to various stations in Toronto, with route 900 Airport Express being the main express bus service to the airport from station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth subway line, and route 52 Lawrence West providing rush hour service to and stations on Line 1 Yonge–University subway line. The TTC Blue Night Network operates local night bus routes to Warden Avenue, Eglinton station and Sunnybrook Hospital. Although the airport terminals are situated outside of the Toronto city limits, TTC services at Pearson do not require a supplementary fare. TTC buses serve both Terminal 1 and Terminal 3.\n\nTwo public transit operators based in Peel Region also operate routes to the airport, Brampton Transit, and MiWay. Brampton Transit operates all-day public transit bus service from Pearson Airport to the city of Brampton, with express service operating to Bramalea Terminal. Brampton Transit buses arrive and depart from Terminal 1. MiWay operates all-day public transit bus service from Pearson Airport to the city of Mississauga, with express service to City Centre Transit Terminal, Humber College, and Winston Churchill Transitway Station, and local routes to Westwood Square Terminal, Renforth station, and Meadowvale Town Centre Terminal. MiWay buses arrive and depart from Terminal 1, Terminal 3, Toronto Pearson Viscount station, and the infield operations area of the airport.\n\nGO Transit is another daily, 24-hours public transit service that operates coaches from the airport to cities across the Greater Toronto Area with express service to Richmond Hill Terminal and Hamilton GO Centre, and local service to Finch Terminal. GO Transit coaches arrive and depart from Terminal 1.\n\nGreyhound Canada operates daily intercity coach service from Pearson Airport to the Toronto Coach Terminal, cities across Southern Ontario, and select cities in the U.S. states of New York and Michigan. Greyhound Canada coaches arrive and depart from Terminal 1.\n\nThe airport is also served by several long-distance van and minibus shuttle operators, which provide transportation from the airport to various municipalities and regional airports throughout Southern Ontario and to select cities and towns in the U.S. states of New York and Michigan.\n\nToronto Pearson is directly accessible from Highway 427 and Highway 409 with Airport Road and Dixon Road providing local access to the airport. There are 12,200 parking spaces available in parking garages adjacent to Terminal 1 and Terminal 3, in addition to several other parking lots located in the immediate area.\n\nCar rentals are available from various major car rental agencies located in the parking garages adjacent to both terminals. Car rentals are also available from off-airport car rental agencies located near Toronto Pearson Viscount station, accessible from both terminals via the Link Train.\n\nTaxicabs and limousines can be accessed at designated taxi stands located outside of both Terminal 1 and Terminal 3. Only official airport-licensed taxis and limousines can legally pick up passengers at Pearson, and all airport-licensed taxi and limo companies use GTAA authorized flat rate fares for travel from the airport.\n\nRidesharing services Uber and Lyft are available at Pearson Airport. Designated rideshare pickup zones are located at both Terminal 1 and Terminal 3. Terminal 1 pickup is from the ground level, while Terminal 3 pickup is from the arrivals level.\n\nPresently two train services operate from the airport, one serving as a airport rail link, the other as a localized people mover. The Union Pearson Express (UP Express) is an airport rail link running between Pearson Airport and Union Station in Downtown Toronto, with intermediate stops at and GO Stations. Trains depart every 15 minutes from Toronto Pearson Terminal 1 station and provide a 25-minute travel time to Union Station, the busiest intermodal transportation facility in Canada. The UP Express operates daily between 5:27 am and 12:57 am.\n\nLink Train is an automated people mover that facilitates inter-terminal transportation at Pearson Airport. It runs between Terminal 1, Terminal 3, and the Viscount Value Park Lot, connecting to the airport terminals at Toronto Pearson Terminal 1 station and Toronto Pearson Terminal 3 station. The Link train operates daily, 24-hour service with trains departing all stations every 4 to 8 minutes.\nIn February 2017, the GTAA announced a proposed transit hub to be located across from Terminal 3 that would connect with Union Pearson Express and may connect with other transit lines extended to the airport like Line 5 Eglinton LRT and GO Transit Regional Express Rail. This proposal would eliminate the Link Train connecting Terminals 1 and 3 with a bridge from the transit hub to Terminal 3 and another bridge connecting Terminal 3 to Terminal 1.\n\nMetrolinx is currently planning the Eglinton Crosstown West Extension which is a western extension of the under-construction Line 5 Eglinton to a proposed transit hub at Pearson Airport across the terminals at the site of Viscount Station. The segment to Renforth Gateway is scheduled to open by 2030-31 with the connection to Pearson Airport opening at an unknown later date. Metrolinx is also studying a potential connection with Line 6 Finch West to the transit hub. Other connections like the Mississauga Transitway are being studied.\n\n\n\n"}

Ritter's disease of the newborn is the most severe form of SSSS, with similar signs and symptoms. SSSS often includes a widespread painful erythroderma, often involving the face, diaper, and other intertriginous areas. Extensive areas of desquamation might be present. Perioral crusting and fissuring are seen early in the course. Unlike toxic epidermal necrolysis, SSSS spares the mucous membranes. It is most common in children under 6 years, but can be seen in adults who are immunosuppressed or have kidney failure.\n\nThe syndrome is induced by epidermolytic exotoxins (exfoliatin) A and B, which are released by \"S. aureus\" and cause detachment within the epidermal layer, by breaking down the desmosomes. One of the exotoxins is encoded on the bacterial chromosome, while the other is encoded on a plasmid. These exotoxins are proteases that cleave desmoglein-1, which normally holds the granulosum and spinosum layers together, similar to the pathophysiology of the autoimmune skin disease, pemphigus vulgaris.\n\nSSSS is a clinical diagnosis. This is sometimes confirmed by isolation of \"S. aureus\" from blood, mucous membranes, or skin biopsy; however, these are often negative. Skin biopsy may show separation of the superficial layer of the epidermis (intraepidermal separation), differentiating SSSS from TEN, wherein the separation occurs at the dermo-epidermal junction (subepidermal separation). SSSS may be difficult to distinguish from toxic epidermal necrolysis and pustular psoriasis.\n\nThe mainstay of treatment for SSSS is supportive care along with eradication of the primary infection. Conservative measures include rehydration, antipyretics (e.g., ibuprofen or paracetamol), management of thermal burns, and stabilization. Parenteral antibiotics to cover \"S. aureus\" should be administered. Most strains of \"S. aureus\" implicated in SSSS have penicillinases, so are penicillin resistant. Therefore, treatment with nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin is typically indicated. Clindamycin is sometimes also used because of its inhibition of exotoxins.\n\nThe prognosis of SSSS in children is excellent, with complete resolution within 10 days of treatment, and without significant scarring. However, SSSS must be differentiated carefully from toxic epidermal necrolysis, which carries a poor prognosis. The prognosis in adults is generally much worse, and depends upon various factors such as time to treatment, host immunity, and comorbidities.\n\nThe clinical features were first described in 1878 by Baron Gottfried Ritter von Rittershain, who observed 297 cases among children in a single Czechoslovakian children's home over a 10-year period.\n\nIn 1885, Nil Filatow, and in 1894, Clement Dukes, described an exantematous disease which they thought to be a form of rubella, but in 1900, Dukes identified it to be a separate entity which came to be known by the names Dukes' disease, Filatov’s disease, or fourth disease. Although Dukes identified it as a separate entity, it is thought not to be different from scarlet fever caused by staphylococcal exotoxin after Keith Powell proposed equating it with the condition currently known as staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome in 1979.\n\n"}

It was a principal dogma of the Hussites and one of the Four Articles of Prague. After the Hussite movement split into various factions early in the Hussite Wars, Hussites that emphasized the laity's right to communion under both kinds became known as Moderate Hussites, Utraquist Hussites, or simply Utraquists. The Utraquists were the largest major Hussite faction. \n\nFollowing the victory of allied Utraquist and Catholic forces in the Hussite Wars, Utraquists constituted a majority of the Bohemian population until the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, nearly two centuries later. The Battle of White Mountain, in 1620, marked the end of the Bohemian Revolt and, consequently, the end of almost two hundred years of Utraquist predominance.\n\nUtraquism was a Christian dogma first proposed by Jacob of Mies, professor of philosophy at the University of Prague, in 1414. It maintained that the Eucharist should be administered \"in both kinds\" – as both bread and wine – to all the congregation, including the laity. The practice among Roman Catholics at the time was for only the priests to partake of the consecrated wine, the Precious Blood.\n\nThe Utraquists were a moderate faction of the Hussites (in contrast to the more radical Taborites, Orebites and Orphans). They were also known as the Prague Party or the Calixtines – from \"calix\", Latin for their emblem, the chalice.\n\nThe Utraquists eventually reunited with the Holy See and defeated the more radical Taborites and Orphans at the Battle of Lipany in 1434. After that battle, nearly all forms of Hussite revival were Utraquist, as seen with George of Podebrady, who even managed to cause the city of Tábor, the famous Taborite stronghold, to convert to Utraquism.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2073586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073586", "title": "Juan Huarte de San Juan", "text": "Juan Huarte de San Juan\n\nJuan Huarte de San Juan or Juan Huarte y Navarro (1529 – 1588) was a Spanish physician and psychologist.\n\nHe was born at Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port (Lower Navarre) toward the end of 1529 or beginning of 1530, and was educated, first, at the university of Huesca. He then went on to the University of Alcalá, where he received his doctorate in medicine in 1560.\n\nThough it appears doubtful whether he practiced as a physician at Huesca, Huarte distinguished himself by his professional skill and heroic zeal during the plague which devastated Baeza in 1566. For a very short period of time, he was appointed doctor by the Cathedral Chapter in 1573. After six months of holding this position, he was fired when he left without permission to request licenses for printing his magnum opus, \"Examen de ingenios para las sciencias\" (\"The Examination of Men's Wits\") or \"The Examination of Talents for the Professions.\"\n\nIn his personal life, he married a woman named Águeda, and they had three children: Antonia (born between 1568-1576), Águeda, and Luis.\n\nHuarte died in Linares in 1588.\n\nHuarte published the first edition of his \"Examen de ingenios para las ciencias\" (\"The Examination of Men's Wits\") in 1575, which won him a European reputation, and was translated by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. Despite its initial proscription by the Inquisition, copies of the \"Examen\" were found in many of Barcelona's public and private libraries (including those of Joaquín Setantí, Jeroni Tarrassa, Joan Nadal de Prats, Pau Ignasi de Dalmases and the library of the Jesuit school). Though now superseded, Huarte's treatise is historically interesting as the first attempt to show the connection between psychology and physiology, and its acute ingenuity is as remarkable as the boldness of its views. After his death, a second, revised and expurgated (by the Inquisition) version was published. Between 1575 and 1800, sixty different editions of \"Examen\" were published. During the 16th, 17th and 18th century, the \"Examen\" was translated into six European languages: French, Italian, English, Latin, German and Dutch. Richard Carew was the translator of \"Examen de Ingenios\" into English, basing his translation on Camilli's Italian version. (This book is the first systematic attempt to relate physiology with psychology, though based on the medicine of Galen. Four editions of this translation were published: in 1594, 1596, 1604 and 1616.)\n\nHe set forth the following theories in his \"Examen de ingenios para las ciencias\":\n\nFirst, it is only possible for someone to have a lone talent, rather than multiple talents. Huarte considered this single talent to be differentiated in a high degree, with differentiation between individuals and nations.\n\nSecond, it is critical to fulfill a profession that is in agreement with the talent a person possesses.\n\nThird, if the individual is \"lacking genius,\" he or she struggles in a futile way with science.\n\nFinally, each talent is marked by a temperament which is corresponding to the physique of a person. This concept relates to his theory on humoral temperaments.\n\nIn \"Examen\", Huarte discusses the treatment of children as it relates to their abilities. In line with his theory regarding single talents, Huarte believed some children are proficient in one particular area while others are not. Because they have these differences, children should be studied while they are young to ascertain their abilities so they can learn efficiently in the area they excel in. While Huarte wanted children to begin acquiring knowledge related to their talents at a young age, he was aware that the tasks would have to be developmentally appropriate. Applying this, children would learn language earlier and logic when they are older.\n\nAs mentioned above, Huarte believed that humoral temperaments had an effect on individual differences. He believed that levels of heat, cold, moistness, and dryness would result in these differences. During this time, humoral temperaments were used to explain differences in age, ethnicity, and intellect. However, Huarte applied the idea of humoral temperaments in a different way. He suggested that humoral temperaments had an effect on differences in memory and understanding. In his theory, memory was dependent on moistness while understanding was dependent on dryness. Following his theory, he believed older people had brains that were dry (understanding), but that means the person has a poor memory as well. Children, on the other hand, were believed to have the opposite problem: they had moist brains useful for memory tasks, but were low in understanding because they were lacking dryness. Huarte also stated that for everyone, memory is better in the morning and worsens throughout the day because brains accumulate moisture while sleeping and dry out over the waking hours.\n\nHuarte stressed \"somatic determinants of behavior\" which originate in the brain. His theory on this combined Greek philosophy with significance placed on the natural determinants of behavior and Christian theology with attention drawn to miraculous enlightenment. His interest in natural determinants of behavior signifies him as a notable pioneer in the field of differential psychology.\n\nIn keeping with tradition during the time, Huarte did not have positive views toward women. He aided in perpetuating the views related to gender differences by using his theory regarding humoral temperaments. According to Huarte, women could not be blamed for being dull, because they were both cold and dry (a humoral temperamental characterization of their gender). In conjunction with this, Huarte taught that intelligence is stored in the testicles, thus justifying his theory that women are, by nature more stupid than men. Historians can interpret these paternalistic biases coinciding with his desire to understand individual differences as insight into how psychologists shaped and supported social norms during and after their time, and use this knowledge to question other gender-differentiated results.\n\nIn 1983, Huarte de San Juan was named the patron of Spanish psychology by Spain's psychology of \"decanos\" (deans). \"Examen de ingenios para las ciencias\" has been acknowledged as being a paradigm for organizational psychology, psychological assessment, Cartesian linguistics, and others. It has been suggested by Martín-Araguz that neuropsychologists would find Huarte's work relevant to their field, and that he may have been the founder of neuropsychology. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, \"Examen\" was thought of as the best known medical treaty available. His influence can be seen (though not always cited) in the work of Miguel de Cervantes (whose \"Don Quixote\" was inspired by him), Francis Bacon, Pierre Charron, Immanuel Kant, Noam Chomsky, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, David Hume, Montesquieu, Friedrich Nietzsche, Francisco de Quevedo, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Arthur Schopenhauer, Jakob Thomasius, and Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. Additionally, Huarte's position on women provides support for the suggestion that the Renaissance was a time for men to make intellectual strides, and that women did not have this chance.\n\n"}

He served in the post from 1988 to 1997, under the governorship of Lord Wilson of Tillyorn and the last governor, Chris Patten.\n\nMathews was born on 14 December 1941. He is the son of George James and Ivy Pricilla Mathews.\n\nHe was educated at Palmer's Grammar School in England. He qualified as a solicitor of England and Wales in 1963 and was in private practice in England until 1965, when he moved to Australia. In Australia, he was Deputy District Registrar of the High Court of Australia in Sydney.\n\nMathews moved to Hong Kong in 1968, where he was appointed a Crown Counsel. He was appointed deputy Law Draftsman in 1978. In 1982 he was appointed Crown Solicitor, having been appointed deputy the year before. In 1988 he was appointed the final Attorney General of Hong Kong succeeding Michael David Thomas QC. He was the first solicitor to be appointed attorney general in Hong Kong. Mathews was a member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council from 1985 to 1995. He was awarded a CMG in 1989.\n\nSoon after becoming attorney general, Mathews had to deal with three scandals involving the Attorney General's Chambers.\n\nThe first involved Christopher Harris, a senior Crown Counsel, who was caught procuring a girl under 12 for sex. On advice from a private barrister, Mathews decided not to prosecute Harris. After a public outcry, and after seeking further advice, he reversed the decision and Harris was convicted and sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment.\n\nSecond, the same year, Warwick Reid, the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, was investigated for receiving bribes and absconded. Mathews admitted later he allowed Reid to stay in his position even though he knew he was under investigation. (Mathews may have been prevented by the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance from saying anything to Reid to suggest he was under investigation.)\n\nThe third was his last-minute intervention in a wounding case involving an English Cathay Pacific pilot Ian Wilkinson. At the criminal trial rather than calling evidence an agreed fact sheet was prepared (without the victim's prior knowledge or consent, which was immediately disputed by the wife's lawyers). The intervention by Matthews raised questions about the administration of justice and the rule of law in Hong Kong as well as the way in which Matthews had handled the matter which had effectively prevented the wife from taking out a private prosecution. Matthews was called before LegCo but refused to explain his decisions. Matthews then made certain statements to the press which were immediately challenged and found to be untrue. The handover of Hong Kong to China prevented this case being further investigated since the Chinese Government said they could not be held responsible for any questionable decisions taken by the previous colonial government and the Lord Chancellor's office claimed it came under the remit of the Foreign Office.\n\nMathews served as Attorney General of Hong Kong until 30 June 1997, when Hong Kong's sovereignty was transferred to People's Republic of China. Mathews was quoted on the possibility of a legal vacuum after the handover as saying: \"After midnight on the 30th of June, it ain't my problem\"\n\nMathews retired after the handover and returned to England. In retirement he has served as deputy district chairman of the Appeals Service and as chairman of the Overseas Service Pensioners' Association.\n\nMathews married Sophie Lee in 1968 and they had two daughters. The marriage was dissolved in 1992 and that year he married Halima Guterres, who is a writer and former journalist with South China Morning Post.\n\nHis recreations are reading, gardening and music.\n\n"}

He began production of Tennent's lager in 1885, having acquired his brother's share of the business a year earlier.\n\nTennent was born in Glasgow the second son of Charles Stewart Parker Tennent and Arabella Jane Hay (after Charles Tennent's death, Arabella married Richard Frederick Fotheringham Campbell). His great-great-grandfather, also Hugh Tennent, founded the Tennent’s Wellpark Brewery, Glasgow in the 1760s. Hugh had one older brother, Archibald Hay Tennent, who was three years his senior.\n\nHugh’s father and grandfather both died in 1864 when he was only a year old. For the next twenty years the firm was successfully run by trustees. During this time the business was built to a value of more than £300,000. The brewery was greatly extended, the plant was modernized and the products promoted internationally.\n\nIn his late teens Tennent took on a senior management role until in 1884, aged 21, he became sole partner of the firm and proprietor of the works. His 21st birthday was celebrated by a banquet in Glasgow City Hall and upon taking control of his father’s business he gave gifts of money to all his employees, numbering at that time between five and six hundred.\n\nHugh Tennent took a close interest in the German industry and its rapid expansion into export markets. In 1881, while still in a senior management position, he travelled on the first of many visits to Bavaria. He was accompanied by Wyllie Clarke, who later became managing director. During the trip they familiarised themselves with lager brewing.\n\nInspired by the Bavarian lagers Hugh Tennent first brewed Tennent's lager in 1885. The transition to lager production was made easier as key parts of the brewing processes in Scotland and Bavaria were similar for example low-temperature fermentation. He later built a new lager brewery on the Wellpark site, which was begun in 1889 and completed in 1891. At the time the enterprise earned the contempt of a local newspaper who hailed it as a ‘madman’s dream’. The lager brewery was set up by engineers with the firm L.A. Riedinger of Augsburg, which had previously set up plants in locations as far apart as Tiflis, Yoklahoma, Cuba and Buenos Aires.\n\nHugh Tennent died, unmarried and childless, in 1890 at age twenty-seven.\n\nAbove his share of the firm, his personal estate was worth at least a quarter of a million pounds. A second Tennent trust was set up to run the business, but Hugh Tennent was the last member of the family in direct control of Tennent’s.\n\n\n"}

All of the four species occur at the southern cone of South America in Chile and Argentina, and all except the flying steamer duck are flightless; even this one species capable of flight rarely takes to the air. The genus name \"Tachyeres\", \"having fast oars\" or \"fast rower\", comes from Ancient Greek ταχυ- \"fast\" + ἐρέσσω \"I row (as with oars)\". The common name \"steamer ducks\" arose because, when swimming fast, they flap their wings into the water as well as using their feet, creating an effect like a paddle steamer. They can be aggressive and are capable of chasing off predators like petrels. Bloody battles of steamer ducks with each other over territory disputes are observed in nature. They even kill waterbirds that are several times their size.\n\nThey are usually placed in the shelduck subfamily Tadorninae. However, mtDNA sequence analyses of the cytochrome \"b\" and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 genes indicate that \"Tachyeres\" rather belongs in a distinct clade of aberrant South American dabbling ducks, which also includes the Brazilian, the crested, and the bronze-winged ducks.\n\nThere are four species:\nThe Chubut steamer duck was only described in 1981.\n\nBased on the \"Taxonomy in Flux\" from John Boyd's website.\n\nFlightless \"Tachyeres\" have a paraphyletic organization, as shown above. There are multiple possible explanations of these organizations. It is unlikely that flightlessness evolved once in all \"Tachyeres\" and then disappeared in \"T. patachonicus\", because of there is no evidence for a reversal of evolution, and these reversals are extremely rare. It is more likely that flightlessness evolved independently in each steamer duck species. However, a candidate gene for flightlessness in steamer ducks has been identified, and this combined with the range of flight capability means the evolutionary history of the group may not be so clear cut.\n\nThere is genomic evidence of recent speciation into four \"Tachyeres\" species. Flightless \"Tachyeres\" are thought to be undergoing a modern evolutionary transition to flightlessness, which explains the range of flight capability observed across the genus. The largest males of the most volant species, the flying steamer duck, are completely incapable of flight, while other individuals rarely fly. The flying steamer duck is the only species to reside in landlocked bodies of water. Generally, island bound/isolated avian populations are more likely to experience evolution towards flightlessness, which may be the case for several \"Tachyeres\" populations in the coastal South American regions.\n\n"}

The form may be permanent or temporary and may or may not remain part of the finished structure. Monolithic domes are a form of monolithic architecture.\n\nThe igloo may be the earliest form of monolithic dome. While it is constructed of blocks of compressed snow, these blocks melt and re-freeze to form a strong, homogeneous structure. The dome-like shape of the igloo exhibits the two major advantages of a dome-shaped structure: great strength, and good insulation. The strength is due to the natural strength of the arch, and the insulation is due to the minimal surface area of a spherical section.\n\nThe first modern monolithic dome structure was built in Provo, Utah, by architect Lee C. Knell, and opened in 1963 as an ice skating rink. Called \"Turtle Reams\" after its 1967 conversion into a general store by new owner Paul Ream, the building stood until it was demolished in 2006 for new construction.\n\nTurtle Reams was built by first creating a mound of dirt in the desired shape of the shell, an ellipsoidal section long, wide and high. The mound was then covered in a grid of rebar, to provide strength, and a layer of concrete approximately thick. After the concrete was cured, the dirt was excavated through the doorways, leaving the roof standing in its place. The floor was then poured to finish the structure.\n\nToday, monolithic domes are used in a variety of residential, commercial and industrial projects. Because of the strength, durability and economics, they are used to store large amounts of various commodities in the cement, fertilizer, agricultural, power and mining industries. Due to their structural integrity, they are used as the containment buildings at some nuclear power plants. Forms have been made using nearly every common structural material including air pressure supported fabric.\n\nModern construction differs significantly from the original concrete-over-dirt method. The current methods were developed by three brothers from Idaho: David, Barry, and Randy South. The first dome built using these method was constructed in April 1976 in Shelley, Idaho:\n\n\nIn instances where necessity requires economical construction for multiple small and basic dwellings, the dome can be built without insulation and the air form can be removed after completion and re-used to build additional domes.\n\nThe dome, when finished, is earthquake, tornado and hurricane resistant (the US Federal Emergency Management Agency rates them as \"near-absolute protection\" from F5 tornadoes and Category 5 Hurricanes). Recently, a number of monolithic domes constructed using MDI techniques have survived major disasters:\n\nThe demolition of Turtle Reams also demonstrated the durability of the monolithic dome structure. A wrecking ball demolished a strip several feet wide around the perimeter of the structure, without a collapse. When a doorway on one side was pulled down, the dome finally tipped over, and collapsed.\n\nThe monolithic dome, for a number of reasons, is very energy efficient. The spherical sections of the dome offer minimal surface area for the volume they contain, so there is less surface for heat transfer with the outside air. The one piece construction of the monolithic dome also eliminates many of the seams through which air can leak, though this is mitigated to some degree in residential domes by the addition of multiple doors and windows. By placing the insulating foam on the outside of the concrete shell, the concrete acts as a thermal mass inside the building, reducing interior temperature fluctuations far more than the traditional home's insulation inside of a brick or stone veneer.\n\nWhile the monolithic dome has numerous demonstrated engineering advantages, there are also some disadvantages, both engineering and social.\n\n\nSocial disadvantages of monolithic domes are to a large degree shared by geodesic domes, due to the similar shape and unorthodox construction. These disadvantages are:\nThe largest monolithic dome in the world is the home of Faith Chapel Christian Center in Birmingham, AL, which is tall, and in diameter. Inside is a floor area of in two levels.\n\nSome communities in the United States have chosen to use monolithic dome technology in the construction of new schools. A map of recently built monolithic dome schools can be found here: \n\nA residential house, the monolithic \"Dome of a Home\" in Pensacola Beach, Florida, has experienced several hurricanes since it was built.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2073628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073628", "title": "Television encryption", "text": "Television encryption\n\nTelevision encryption, often referred to as \"scrambling\", is encryption used to control access to pay television services, usually cable or satellite television services.\n\nPay television exists to make revenue from subscribers, and sometimes those subscribers do not pay. The prevention of \"piracy\" on cable and satellite networks has been one of the main factors in the development of Pay TV encryption systems.\n\nThe early cable-based Pay TV networks used no security. This led to problems with people connecting to the network without paying. Consequently, some methods were developed to frustrate these self-connectors. The early Pay TV systems for cable television were based on a number of simple measures. The most common of these was a channel-based filter that would effectively stop the channel being received by those who had not subscribed. These filters would be added or removed according to the subscription. As the number of television channels on these cable networks grew, the filter-based approach became increasingly impractical.\n\nOther techniques such as adding an interfering signal to the video or audio began to be used as the simple filter solutions were easily bypassed. As the technology evolved, addressable set-top boxes became common, and more complex scrambling techniques such as digital encryption of the audio or video cut and rotate (where a line of video is cut at a particular point and the two parts are then reordered around this point) were applied to signals.\n\nEncryption was used to protect satellite-distributed feeds for cable television networks. Some of the systems used for cable feed distribution were expensive. As the DTH market grew, less secure systems began to be used. Many of these systems (such as OAK Orion) were variants of cable television scrambling systems that affected the synchronisation part of the video, inverted the video signal, or added an interfering frequency to the video. All of these analogue scrambling techniques were easily defeated.\n\nIn France, Canal+ launched a scrambled service in 1984. It was also claimed that it was an unbreakable system. Unfortunately for that company, an electronics magazine, \"Radio Plans\", published a design for a pirate decoder within a month of the channel launching.\n\nIn the USA, HBO was one of the first services to encrypt its signal using the VideoCipher II system. In Europe, FilmNet scrambled its satellite service in September 1986, thus creating one of the biggest markets for pirate satellite TV decoders in the world, because the system that FilmNet used was easily hacked. One of FilmNet's main attractions was that it would screen hard-core porn films on various nights of the week. The VideoCipher II system proved somewhat more difficult to hack, but it eventually fell prey to the pirates.\n\nAnalog and digital pay television have several conditional access systems that are used for pay-per-view (PPV) and other subscriber related services. Originally, analog-only cable television systems relied on set-top boxes to control access to programming, as television sets originally were not \"cable-ready\". Analog encryption was typically limited to premium channels such as HBO or channels with adult-oriented content. In those cases, various proprietary video synchronization suppression methods were used to control access to programming. In some of these systems, the necessary sync signal was on a separate subcarrier though sometimes the sync polarity is simply inverted, in which case, if used in conjunction with PAL, a SECAM L TV with a cable tuner can be used to partially descramble the signal though only in black and white and with inverted luminance and thus a multi standard TV which supports PAL L is preferred to decode the color as well. This, however will lead to a part of the video signal being received as audio as well and thus another TV with preferably no auto mute should be used for audio decoding. Analog set-top boxes have largely been replaced by digital set-top boxes that can directly control access to programming as well as digitally decrypt signals.\n\nVideoCipher II RS (VCII RS) is the scrambling system that C-Band satellite pay TV channels originally used. A VCII-capable satellite receiver is required to decode VCII channels. VCII has largely been replaced by DigiCipher 2 in North America. Originally, VCII-based receivers had a separate modem technology for pay-per-view access known as Videopal. This technology became fully integrated in later-generation analog satellite television receivers.\n\n\nDigiCipher 2 is General Instrument's proprietary video distribution system. DigiCipher 2 is based upon MPEG-2. A 4DTV satellite receiver is required to decode DigiCipher 2 channels. In North America, most digital cable programming is accessed with DigiCipher 2-based set-top boxes. DigiCipher 2 may also be referred to as DCII.\n\nPowerVu is another popular digital encryption technology used for non-residential usage. PowerVu was developed by Scientific Atlanta. Other commercial digital encryption systems are, Nagravision (by Kudelski), Viaccess (by France Telecom), and Wegener.\n\nIn the US, both DirecTV and Dish Network direct-broadcast satellite systems use digital encryption standards for controlling access to programming. DirecTV uses VideoGuard, a system designed by NDS. DirecTV has been cracked in the past, which led to an abundance of cracked smartcards being available on the black market. However, a switch to a stronger form of smart card (the P4 card) wiped out DirectTV piracy soon after it was introduced. Since then, no public cracks have become available. Dish Network uses Nagravision (2 and 3) encryption. The now-defunct VOOM and PrimeStar services both used General Instruments/Motorola equipment, and thus used a DigiCipher 2-based system very similar to that of earlier 4DTV large dish satellite systems.\n\nIn Canada, both Bell TV and Shaw Direct DBS systems use digital encryption standards. Bell TV, like Dish Network, uses Nagravision for encryption. Shaw Direct, meanwhile, uses a DigiCipher 2-based system, due to their equipment also being sourced from General Instruments/Motorola.\n\nZenith Electronics developed an encryption scheme for their Phonevision system of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nOak Orion was originally used for analog satellite television pay channel access in Canada. It was innovative for its time as it used digital audio. It has been completely replaced by digital encryption technologies. Oak Orion was used by Sky Channel in Europe between the years 1982 and 1987. Oak developed related encryption systems for cable TV and broadcast pay TV services such as ONTV.\n\nLeitch Viewguard is an analog encryption standard used primarily by broadcast TV networks in North America. Its method of scrambling is by re-ordering the lines of video (Line Shuffle), but leaves the audio intact. Terrestrial broadcast CATV systems in Northern Canada used this conditional access system for many years. It is only occasionally used today on some satellite circuits because of its similarity to D2-MAC and B-MAC.\n\nThere was also a version that encrypted the audio using a digital audio stream in the horizontal blanking interval like the VCII system. One US network used that for its affiliate feeds and would turn off the analog sub carriers on the satellite feed.\n\nB-MAC has not been used for DTH applications since PrimeStar switched to an all-digital delivery system in the mid-1990s.\n\nVideoCrypt was an analogue cut and rotate scrambling system with a smartcard based conditional access system. It was used in the 1990s by several European satellite broadcasters, mainly British Sky Broadcasting. It was also used by Sky New Zealand (Sky-NZ). One version of Videocrypt (VideoCrypt-S) had the capability of scrambling sound. A soft encryption option was also available where the encrypted video could be transmitted with a fixed key and any VideoCrypt decoder could decode it.\n\nRITC Discret 1 is a system based on horizontal video line delay and audio scrambling. The start point of each line of video was pseudorandomly delayed by either 0 ns, 902 ns, or 1804 ns. First used in 1984 by French channel Canal Plus, it was widely compromised after the December 1984 issue of \"Radio Plans\" magazine printed decoder plans. The BBC also used the Discret system in the late 1980s, as part of testing the use of off-air hours for encrypted specialist programming, with BMTV (British Medical Television) being broadcast on BBC Two. This would ultimately lead to the launch of the scrambled BBC Select service in the early 1990s.\n\nUsed by European channel FilmNet, the SATPAC interfered with the horizontal and vertical synchronisation signals and transmitted a signal containing synchronisation and authorisation data on a separate subcarrier. The system was first used in September 1986 and saw many upgrades as it was easily compromised by pirates. By September 1992, FilmNet changed to D2-MAC EuroCrypt.\n\nAdded an interfering sine wave of a frequency circa 93.750 kHz to the video signal. This interfering signal was approximately six times the frequency of the horizontal refresh. It had an optional sound scrambling using Spectrum Inversion. Used in the UK by BBC for its world service broadcasts and by the now defunct UK movie channel \"Premiere\".\n\nUsed by German/Swiss channel Teleclub in the early 1990s, this system employed various methods such as video inversion, modification of synchronisation signals, and a pseudo line delay effect.\n\nConditional Access system using the D2-MAC standard. Developed mainly by France Telecom, the system was smartcard based. The encryption algorithm in the smartcard was based on DES. It was one of the first smart card based systems to be compromised.\n\nAn older Nagravision system for scrambling analogue satellite and terrestrial television programs was used in the 1990s, for example by the German pay-TV broadcaster Premiere. In this line-shuffling system, 32 lines of the PAL TV signal are temporarily stored in both the encoder and decoder and read out in permuted order under the control of a pseudorandom number generator. A smartcard security microcontroller (in a key-shaped package) decrypts data that is transmitted during the blanking intervals of the TV signal and extracts the random seed value needed for controlling the random number generation. The system also permitted the audio signal to be scrambled by inverting its spectrum at 12.8 kHz using a frequency mixer.\n\n\n"}

In contrast, the state in which the molecule aligns to a substance in parallel is called homogeneous alignment.\n\nThere are various other ways of alignment in liquid crystals.

Located at the base of the western side of the Great Rift Valley, Arba Minch consists of the uptown administrative centre of Shecha and 4 kilometers away the downtown commercial and residential areas of Sikela, which are connected by a paved road. On the eastern side of Sikela is the gate to Nechisar National Park, which covers the isthmus between Lake Abaya to the north and Lake Chamo to the south. Buses and taxis connect the uptown and downtown parts; both parts have schools. Kulfo River flows through the town, and drains into Lake Chamo.\n\nArba Minch is known as a source for fruit, including mango, banana, orange, apple, guava and pineapple, and is also known for its fish farms. Indicating its richness of fish a local singer named Abile Chedo sang the song \"Nu Dere Gamo Gofa Oycha Arbaminche muziri kalsi yedes Abaya-Chamo mole\". It is the home of Arba Minch University and the Southwest Synod of the Mekane Yesus Church. The town also is served by Arba Minch Airport, (ICAO code HAAM, IATA AMH).\n\nArba Minch was founded in the early 1960s by then Fitawrari Aemeroselasie Abebe and the city succeeded Chencha as the provincial capital of Gamo Gofa. The oral tradition has it that Fitawrari Aemiro Selassie Abebe had to fight with prominent figures of Chencha (Aba Gaga) to move the capital from Chencha to Arbaminch. One of the reasons for Aemiroselassie Abebe to move the provincial centre from Chencha to Arbaminch was for travelers from Gidole to Chencha to take a break after a long, hot crossing of the arid Rift Valley. Roads were built linking the new town to Soddo and making Arba Minch only a day's journey by road to the capital, Addis Ababa. A telephone line connecting the town to the capital, costing E$ 250,000, was turned up on 15 July 1967.\n\nThe Norwegian Lutheran Mission opened a station at Arba Minch in 1970, which included a trade school; the school's operation was later taken over by the Mekane Yesus Church. At the beginning of the Ethiopian Revolution public demonstrations occurred in the town, and four people were killed in clashes with the police on 28 March 1974. Following the revolution privately held plantations were made into state farms.\n\nThe 193 million birr Arba Minch Textile Mill was opened on 6 May 1992 in the presence of Ethiopian Prime Minister Tamirat Layne. The mill would produce polyester mixed with cotton grey fabrics. According to the SNNPR's Bureau of Finance and Economic Development, other amenities in Arba Minch include postal service, 24-hour electrical service, a bank and a hospital. May 2010, the Ethiopian Roads Authority awarded a contract worth 563 million E$ to the construction firm of Brehane Hagos to build a road 60 kilometers in length from this town to Belta. The United States military operated a facility at Arba Minch from 2011 until September 2015. The facility served as the base for several General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\nBased on the 2007 Census conducted by the CSA, this town has a total population of 74,879, of whom 39,208 are men and 35,671 women. The majority of the inhabitants practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, with 56.04% of the population reporting that belief, 38.47% were Protestants, and 4.16% were Muslim.\n\nThe 1994 national census reported this town had a total population of 40,020 of whom 20,096 were males and 19,924 were females.\n\n"}

{"id": "2073660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073660", "title": "Fork end", "text": "Fork end\n\nA fork end, fork-end, or forkend is a slot in a bicycle frame or bicycle fork where the axle of a bicycle wheel is attached. A dropout is a type of fork end that allows the rear wheel to be removed without first derailing the chain. \n\nTrack bicycle frames have track fork ends, on which the opening faces rearwards. Because they do not have dropouts, the chain must be derailed from the sprocket before the rear wheel can be removed from a typical track bike. Some single-speed bicycles intended for street or trail use are also equipped with track fork ends instead of dropouts.\n\nOn bicycles that do not have a derailleur or other chain tensioning device, rear \"horizontal dropouts\" allow adjustment of chain tension, and can accommodate a range of chain lengths or cog sizes. They were standard on most older derailleur bicycles from before the 1990s. An older derailleur-equipped bicycle with horizontal dropouts can be readily converted into singlespeed, fixed gear or to use an internally geared hub. \n\nRear \"vertical dropouts\" have the slot facing downwards. The advantage is that the wheel axle cannot slip forward compared with horizontal dropouts. The disadvantage is that on a bicycle without a rear derailleur but with vertical dropouts, the chain tension cannot be adjusted by moving the wheel forwards or backwards, and needs another means of chain-tensioning, by a derailleur, chain tensioner, or eccentric bottom bracket or rear hub. Fixed wheel bicycles cannot use any form of chain tensioning device, because the lower run of chain is pulled very tight when using the transmission as a brake.\n\nIn general, a modern bicycle frame intended for derailleur gears will have a vertical dropout, while one designed for singlespeed or hub gears will have horizontal dropouts or track fork ends.\n\nLawyer lips or lawyer tabs (a type of \"positive retention device\"), a nineteenth century invention, are tabs fitted to the fork ends on the front fork of bicycles sold in some countries (particularly the U.S.) to prevent a wheel from leaving the fork if the quick release skewer comes undone. They were reintroduced in response to lawsuits supported by experts including John Howard, in cases where incorrectly adjusted quick release wheels came out of the forks. Lawyer tabs are designed to compensate for the fact that many riders do not know how to operate a quick release properly: some riders treat them as a folding wing nut, and others do not tighten them enough for fear of snapping them or shearing the skewer (both are not likely given the normal range of human strength, and the mechanical advantages involved, as long as the skewer is not damaged or flawed).\n\nA side-effect is that the quick release, which was developed to allow the wheel to be removed without having to unscrew any components, no longer works as designed: the skewer must be unscrewed in order to remove the wheel (although tools do remain unnecessary). This means that the tension on refitting must be adjusted again. Some cyclists file off the lawyer tabs so the quick release works as originally intended.\n\nA correctly secured quick release is unlikely to be ejected from the fork end in normal use where rim brakes are in use, although recently there has been some evidence, notably from James Annan, a British scientist working in Japan, suggesting that the moments in disc brake systems can cause quick-release front wheels to be ejected past the lawyer tabs. A small number of serious crashes have been attributed to this cause. This is controversial, and the fork manufacturers have not admitted a fault, although there is some evidence that they may accept the principle, and advice on checking quick release tension has been strengthened. A complete solution to ejection risk would involve mounting the front disc brake caliper in front of the fork blade rather than behind, as the reaction force on the disc would then be into, rather than out of, the fork-end. However, this would involve major retooling by fork and brake manufacturers, though at least one manufacturer has placed the disc caliper mounts on the front of the right fork blade. This allows standard disc brakes to be used, and also makes it easier to mount mudguards.\n\nFork ends and dropouts may support one or more eyelets, small protruding tabs with holes, often threaded, to facilitate the mounting of racks and fenders.\n\nSome rear track fork ends have threaded devices (\"chaintugs\") to aid in setting the proper chain tension. These may be integral to the fork end or separate items. They work by holding the rear axle in an eye at the end of a threaded bolt. The bolt passes through a cap which fits over the open fork end. Tightening the bolts on each side causes the axle to be pulled backwards towards the open fork end, tensing the chain. Chaintugs can also solve the problem of \"axle creep\" on hard-ridden fixed-gear bicycles, especially those with hard chromed fork ends, which may not offer adequate grip for the serrated track nuts.\n\nThe derailleur hanger or mech hanger is the part of the dropout that the rear derailleur attaches to. \n\nMost non-steel framed bikes have a separate removable derailleur hanger, generally made from aluminium which is bolted to the dropout. These are intended as a cheap replaceable part so that in the event of an accident or mechanical problem that could damage the derailleur or frame, the derailleur hanger breaks or deforms instead. Sometimes a shear bolt which is designed as a weak point will also be used. There are dozens of different derailleur hangers available and one model is seldom interchangeable with another.\n\nBecause of huge variety, derailleur hangers can be classified :\n\n\nIn general, steel-framed bikes do not have a removable derailleur hanger, because a steel dropout and hanger is stronger and therefore less likely to be damaged, and also it is more malleable and less likely to work harden during deformation and generally can be bent back into shape without breaking.\n\nThe derailleur hanger must be aligned correctly for proper indexed shifting, with the rear derailleur bolt hole and the rear axle close to parallel. If it is out of alignment, the rear derailleur will not move far enough, with respect to the rear sprockets, with each click. A special tool exists to measure and correct misaligned hangers.\n\nOn frames with no derailleur hanger, a direct mount derailleur or derailleur with a hanger plate is used. These only fit bikes with horizontal dropouts, and are held in place by a small bolt and the rear wheel axle. These have now been effectively superseded by the derailleur hanger. Since a derailleur designed to be fitted to a separate hanger will be aligned lower on the bike than one that bolts directly onto the frame, it follows that a derailleur must be selected firstly with the mounting method in mind.\n\nSome rear, horizontal, forward-facing dropouts have small adjustment screws threaded through the very rear to aid in positioning the axle precisely. The screws may be fitted with springs to keep them from moving. \nThe most common screw size for the adjustment screws is M3.\n"}

He also goes by the names Joseph Arias and Joe Arias.\n\nAfter high school he sang with the rock band Purlie, which had a 1973 single on Capitol Records, and then had a stint with improvisational comedy group the Groundlings. In 1976 he and his best friend Kim Hastreiter - who would go on to co-found \"Paper\" magazine - drove across country in a pickup truck and moved to New York City.\n\nArias eventually got a job at the Fiorucci designer clothing store. He and other store staff famously performed (danced and modeled clothes) in the shop windows. While working at the store he became friends with alternative musician Klaus Nomi, singing backup and designing sets and costumes. On December 15, 1979, Nomi and Arias appeared on \"Saturday Night Live\" accompanying David Bowie for a live performance of three songs: \"The Man Who Sold the World\", \"TVC 15\" and \"Boys Keep Swinging\". While in New York, he also performed with Ann Magnuson in a band called Strange Party which recorded and performed in various night clubs. Upon Nomi's death, Arias became executor to the Klaus Nomi (Sperber) estate. A tribute to his friend is held in Berlin every year, and the documentary film \"The Nomi Song\" was released in 2004. A film on the life Arias shared with Nomi was in development in 2010 with Alan Cumming slated to play Nomi.\n\nArias, who is openly gay, gradually became involved in the burgeoning 1980s New York performance art scene, appearing regularly at Club 57 and other downtown venues. During these years he also began crafting a successful career in cabaret, channeling the vocal style and mannerisms of Billie Holiday.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Arias covered the songs of Holiday in a show titled \"Strange Fruit\" which ran for over a year at the Astor Theater on Lafayette Street in New York City and received a positive notice from John Lahr in \"The New Yorker\".\n\nThe 1990s also saw Arias perform in weekly shows at Bar d'O, an intimate lounge in the West Village of New York City. Regular guest performers at Bar d'O included Sade Pendarvis, Daniel Isengart and Flotilla Debarge. The evenings have inspired annual reunion shows each December at Indochine restaurant and became the subject of a 2011 documentary film produced by Bobby Sheehan.\n\nIn 2003 Arias moved to Las Vegas, Nevada to star in Cirque du Soleil's Zumanity at the New York-New York Hotel & Casino. In addition to starring in the show, he co-wrote two of the show's songs. After six years, Arias returned to New York where he starred in \"Arias with a Twist\", a collaboration with puppeteer Basil Twist at HERE Arts Center. Produced by Barbara Busackino and Tandem Otter Productions, the show received a positive review from Ben Brantley in the \"New York Times\". The show has toured to Los Angeles and Paris and spawned a \"docufantasy\" film of the same name which premiered at the TriBeCa Film Festival in 2010.\n\n\"Arias with a Twist: Deluxe\", a revamped and expanded version of the show, returned to New York for a limited run at Abrons Arts Center from September 14 to October 16, 2011. Arias' relationship with Abrons began in October 2010 when \"Joey Arias in Concert\" marked Arias' first concert appearances in New York in over a decade. Based on the success of the show, Earl Dax collaborated with Josh Wood who produced Arias in concert at New York's Town Hall on April 21, 2010.\n\nArias continues to perform in venues such as Joe's Pub and Feinstein's/54 Below.\n\nFilm credits include \"Big Top Pee-wee\"; \"Mondo New York\"; \"Elvira, Mistress of the Dark\"; \"Flawless\"; \"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything!

{"id": "2073676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073676", "title": "Tonquin (1807 ship)", "text": "Tonquin (1807 ship)\n\nTonquin was a 290-ton American merchant ship initially operated by Fanning & Coles and later by the Pacific Fur Company (PFC), a subsidiary of the American Fur Company (AFC). Its first commander was Edmund Fanning, who sailed to the Qing Empire for valuable Chinese trade goods in 1807. The vessel was outfitted for another journey to China and then was sold to German-American entrepreneur John Jacob Astor. Included within his intricate plans to assume control over portions of the lucrative North American fur trade, the ship was intended to establish and supply trading outposts on the Pacific Northwest coast. Valuable animal furs purchased and trapped in the region would then be shipped to China, where consumer demand was high for particular pelts.\n\n\"Tonquin\" left New York City for the Columbia River in late 1810. From there the vessel sailed across the Atlantic Ocean until reaching the Falkland Islands in December. Captain Jonathan Thorn marooned eight PFC employees there, though they were secured the same day after other men threatened to kill Thorn. After passing Cape Horn into the Pacific Ocean, \"Tonquin\" visited the Kingdom of Hawaii in February 1811. Sorely needed fresh produce and animal products were purchased and 24 Native Hawaiian Kanakas hired after holding negotiations with Kamehameha I and Kalanimoku. \"Tonquin\" finally reached the Columbia River on 22 March 1811. In the subsequent days, attempts to find a safe route over the Columbia Bar killed eight men.\n\nWork began in May 1811 on the sole trading post founded by \"Tonquin\", Fort Astoria, on the present-day Oregon coast. After construction was completed, the ship departed with a majority of the trade goods and general provisions from the fort, intending to trade them with indigenous tribes on the coast of Vancouver Island. When the crew began bartering with Tla-o-qui-aht natives at Clayoquot Sound in June, a dispute arose due to Captain Thorn's poor treatment of an elder. All but four members of the crew were killed by armed Tla-o-qui-aht led by chief Wickaninnish. The survivors intentionally detonated the ship's powder magazine, and \"Tonquin\" was destroyed and sunk. Joseachal, a Quinault interpreter previously hired by Thorn, was the sole crew member to survive the entire incident and return to Fort Astoria. While there, he held several conversations with Duncan McDougall and gave the only detailed account of how \"Tonquin\" was destroyed.\n\n\"Tonquin\" was constructed by Adam and Noah Brown at a dry dock in New York City in 1807.\n\n\"Tonquin\" was first purchased by Fanning & Coles to participate in the Old China Trade. It originally had a crew of 24, including its captain, Edmund Fanning. She departed New York City harbor on 26 May 1807 for the port of Guangzhou. Outside the port cities of China, \"Tonquin\" survived a typhoon while crossing the Macclesfield Bank. From there the vessel passed the Wanshan Archipelago on its way to Guangzhou. Prior to returning to the United States, \"Tonquin\" was detained by Commodore Edward Pellew. Apparently Fanning was previously acquainted with both Pellew and his father, and after a discussion with Pellew, Fanning subsequently was allowed to start the return voyage, leaving the port on 18 November 1807.\n\nAnother vessel owned by Fanning & Coles, \"Hope\", was encountered the same day. After meeting with its captain, Reuben Brumley, Fanning continued to sail towards the Bocca Tigris. A squadron of British vessels stationed there stopped \"Tonquin\" and detained it for a day. The following day, orders from Commodore Pellew arrived, detailing that \"Tonquin\" was to be freed immediately and sent Fanning \"his apology for your detention, and his good wishes, that you may have a pleasant and safe passage.\" Prior to the departure of the principal British officers, a toast to the United States and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was held. Fanning returned to New York City with a full cargo of valuable trade goods on 6 March 1808.\n\nOrganized in 1808, the second voyage of \"Tonquin\" was focused on the active sandalwood trade throughout the Pacific Ocean. The previous year, an arrangement with a group of iTaukei people on Fiji was made by Captain Brumley of \"Hope\". The sandalwood tree \"Santalum yasi\" was to be cut, collected, and processed by the iTaukei until Brumley returned in 18 months. The then still active Embargo Act of 1807 was a potential roadblock in this overseas project. Coles and Fanning both went to Washington, D.C. to request federal approval for the voyage to Fiji. There they held meetings with Albert Gallatin, the Secretary of the Treasury. Gallatin sent the proposal to President Thomas Jefferson, who formally approved it.\n\n\"Tonquin\" was dispatched to Fiji on 15 June 1808. Brumley was appointed captain, with Coles and Fanning both on board. From New York City, the vessel went south through the Atlantic Ocean and sailed past part of the Brazilian coast and later Gough Island. After passing Cape Horn, the ship continued to sail west, landing at King George Sound in modern Western Australia on 8 October 1808. A tent there was made to allow crew members with scurvy to recover. Local Noongar groups frequently visited the Americans at their tent. Through signs the Noongar would initiate potential commercial transactions by establishing their peaceful intentions through dropping their weapons. Only after the Americans would put down their firearms would a spirited trade begin between the two groups. American goods such as beads, metal buttons and knives were often exchanged in return for Noongar-manufactured stone tools and food supplies. Those of the crew afflicted with illness were restored to health over the following days. \"Tonquin\" left the sound on 21 October for Tongatapu, where local peoples sold the crew stockpiles of \"hogs, bread-fruit, [and] yams\" among other products.\n\nOn 10 December, \"Tonquin\" passed Vatoa and landed at Vanua Levu the following day. Greeted by a group of iTaukei men bearing gifts of fruit, the Americans informed their hosts of the previous agreement made over sandalwood. The dignitaries soon departed to transmit news elsewhere. Shortly after sunrise the next day, iTaukei men gave fresh coconuts, breadfruit, hogs, and yams from their assembled canoes. The local leader, Tynahoa, arrived with his followers and announced that he had the agreed amount of sandalwood harvested and stockpiled. Over the course of an hour the Americans and Tynahoa held a discussion on board \"Tonquin\". He told the merchants that several British ships from Port Jackson had visited and were still anchored nearby during the time of Brumley's absence. However, he was insistent that no sandalwood had been sold to them, as he had declared a tabu on the sale of sandalwood among his subordinates.\n\nThe sandalwood was delivered gradually to \"Tonquin\" from subjects of Tynahoa. This process would span several months, although the wait was apparently worth it. Fanning later stated that the entire hull and part of the deck were loaded with the raw material. The tabu was formally absolved by Tynahoa, allowing the waiting British merchants to finally purchase their own supplies of sandalwood. \"Tonquin\" departed for Guangzhou on 22 March 1809. Sailing roughly northwest from Vanua Levu, the islands of modern Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands were sighted, in addition to parts of the Federated States of Micronesia, such as Kapingamarangi, which Fanning called the Equator Isles. After entering the Guangzhou port, the sandalwood cargo was sold in return for various Chinese products. \"Tonquin\" safely returned to New York City.\n\n\"Tonquin\" was sold for $37,860 () to German-American businessman John Jacob Astor on 23 August 1810. Astor purchased the vessel to spearhead his plans for gaining a foothold in the ongoing maritime fur trade on the Pacific Northwest Coast of North America. \"Tonquin\" was assigned to the Pacific Fur Company (PFC) to accomplish this major commercial goal. The PFC was a subsidiary venture funded largely by the American Fur Company, the original fur enterprise founded by Astor in 1808. Astor was able to gain the services of United States Navy lieutenant Jonathan Thorn and put him in command of the 10-gun merchant vessel.\n\nOn 8 September 1810, \"Tonquin\" departed New York harbor bound for the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest. Cargo on board included fur trade goods, seeds, building material for a trading post, tools, and the frame of a schooner to be used in the coastal trade. The crew consisted of 34 people including the captain, 30 of whom were British subjects. Four partners of the company were on board: Duncan McDougall, David and Robert Stuart, and Alexander McKay. Additionally there were 12 clerks and 13 Canadian voyageurs, plus four tradesmen: Augustus Roussel, a blacksmith; Johann Koaster, a carpenter; Job Aitkem, a boat builder; and George Bell, a cooper.\n\nAfter leaving the national waters of the United States, \"Tonquin\" sailed southeast into the Atlantic. On 5 October, the ship came within sight of Boa Vista in the Cape Verde Islands. The enforced policy of impressment by the United Kingdom made Thorn wary of passing British vessels. Consequently, he decided against staying at the holdings of the Kingdom of Portugal and avoided the Cape Verde Islands. After sailing down the coast of West Africa, \"Tonquin\" made way for South America. Off the coast of Argentina an extreme storm struck, ruining many of the sails and adding two additional leaks in the hull. As the voyage continued on, the freshwater supplies dwindled to three gills a day per sailing member.\n\nThe vessel landed at the Falkland Islands on 4 December to make repairs and take on water supplies, with a suitable source of freshwater located at Port Egmont. Captain Thorn set sail on 11 December without eight of the men, including partner David Stuart, Gabriel Franchère and Alexander Ross. Having only a rowboat, the eight men spent over six hours rowing before they caught up with \"Tonquin\". Robert Stuart quickly threatened Thorn to stop the ship, saying if he refused then \"You are a dead man this instant.\" This display made Thorn order the \"Tonquin\" crew to sail back and pick up the stranded crew. Thorn's actions led to increasing tensions between him and the employees of the Pacific Fur Company. Communication between company workers was no longer held in English to keep the captain excluded from discussions. Company partners held talks in their ancestral Scottish Gaelic and hired PFC workers used Canadian French. The atmosphere of \"their jokes and chanting their outlandish songs\" greatly frustrated Thorn. On 25 December, \"Tonquin\" safely traversed around Cape Horn and sailed north into the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\"Tonquin\" reached the Kingdom of Hawaii on 12 February 1811, dropping anchor at Kealakekua Bay. The possibility of men deserting the ship in favor of the islands became a major threat. Thorn had no choice but to make amends with the PFC partners to police the crew. Several men abandoned ship but the cooperation of the nearby Native Hawaiians saw their return. One man was flogged, another put in chains. Thorn assembled all of the crew and PFC employees and harassed the men to remain on the ship. Commercial transactions eventually began with the Hawaiians; the crew purchased cabbage, sugar cane, purple yams, taro, coconuts, watermelon, breadfruit, hogs, goats, two sheep, and poultry for \"glass beads, iron rings, needles, cotton cloth\". A courier from government agent John Young ordered \"Tonquin\" to visit him for meat supplies and then to have an audience with King Kamehameha I who resided on Oʻahu.\n\nUpon entering Honolulu, the crew was greeted by Francisco de Paula Marín and Isaac Davis. Marín acted as an interpreter in negotiations with Kamehameha I and Kalanimoku, a prominent Hawaiian government official. Besides his work in discussion between the Hawaiian Monarch and the PFC officers, Marín also acted as the pilot to guide the ship into port, for which he received five Spanish dollars. Twenty-four Hawaiian kanakas were recruited for three years service, half in the fur venture and the other half as laborers on \"Tonquin\". One of the Hawaiians, Naukane, was appointed by Kamehameha I to oversee the interests of these laborers. Naukane was given the name John Coxe while on \"Tonquin\" and later joined the North West Company. \"Tonquin\" and its crew left the Hawaiian Kingdom on 1 March 1811.\nThe Columbia River was reached on 22 March 1811, but its dangerous bar posed a major problem. Thorn sent five men in a boat to attempt to locate the channel, but the rough surf capsized the vessel and its crew was lost. Two days later another attempt by an additional small boat also sank. Of the five crew members, which included two Hawaiian Kanakas, only an American and a Hawaiian survived. In total eight men died attempting to find a safe route past the Columbia Bar. Finally, on March 24, \"Tonquin\" crossed into the Columbia's estuary and laid anchor in Baker's Bay. The personnel then proceeded fifteen miles up the river to present-day Astoria, Oregon, where they spent two months laboring to establish Fort Astoria. Some trade goods and other materials that composed the cargo were transferred to the new trading post. During this work, small transactions with curious Chinookan Clatsop people occurred.\n\nOn 5 June 1811, \"Tonquin\" left Baker's Bay with a crew of 24 and sailed north for Vancouver Island to trade with various Nuu-chah-nulth peoples living on the island's west coast. Alexander McKay was aboard the ship as supercargo and James Lewis as clerk. Near Destruction Island, a member of the Quinault nation, Joseachal, was recruited by Thorn to act as an interpreter, being recorded as \"Joseachal\" by McDougall in company records. He had a sister married to a Tla-o-qui-aht man, a factor that has been attributed to his later survival on Vancouver Island.\n\nWhile anchored at Clayoquot Sound, the \"Tonquin\" crew engaged in fur trading activities with the natives. Members of the neighboring Tla-o-qui-aht nation boarded the ship in large numbers to trade. Commercial dealings were negotiated between an experienced elder, Nookamis, and Thorn. Thorn offered an exchange rate found to be unsatisfactory by the elder, who wanted five blankets for every fur skin sold. These discussions continued on throughout the day and Thorn increasingly became frustrated at the indigenous intransigence to accept his terms. The interpreter later informed McDougall that Thorn \"got in a passion with Nookamis\", taking one of Nookamis' fur skins and hitting him on the face with it. After this outburst, Thorn ordered the ship prepare to depart, with the Tla-o-qui-aht still on board.\n\nThe Tla-o-qui-aht consulted among themselves and on 15 June, as \"Tonquin\" was close to leaving the area, offered to trade their fur stockpiles again. They proposed that in return for a skin, the PFC officers sell three blankets and a knife. McDougall recounted that \"A brisk trade was carried on all the Indians setting round on the decks of the Ship were supplied with a knife a piece.\" Violence immediately erupted as warriors led by Wickaninnish attacked the crew on board, killing all but four of the men. Three crew members escaped in a rowboat during the confusion, and one badly wounded man, James Lewis, was left aboard the ship. The following day, 16 June, Lewis allegedly scuttled \"Tonquin\" by lighting a fuse that detonated the ship's powder magazine when the Tla-o-qui-aht returned to loot the ship; the explosion may have killed more than 100 natives. The crew members who had escaped during the initial massacre were allegedly captured and tortured to death by the Tla-o-qui-aht following the explosion. The only known survivor of the crew was Joseachal, who arrived back at Fort Astoria with the assistance of prominent Lower Chinookan noble Comcomly. His account is the only one detailing the fate of the \"Tonquin\".\n\nTwo locations, Tonquin Valley and Tonquin Pass, were named after \"Tonquin\". A movie was in planning stages in 2008 to portray the events ending with the 1811 destruction of \"Tonquin\".\n\n\n\n"}

The line element of a stationary spacetime has the form formula_2\n\nwhere formula_4 is the time coordinate, formula_5 are the three spatial coordinates and formula_6 is the metric tensor of 3-dimensional space. In this coordinate system the Killing vector field formula_7 has the components formula_8. formula_9 is a positive scalar representing the norm of the Killing vector, i.e., formula_10, and formula_11 is a 3-vector, called the twist vector, which vanishes when the Killing vector is hypersurface orthogonal. The latter arises as the spatial components of the twist 4-vector formula_12(see, for example, p. 163) which is orthogonal to the Killing vector formula_7, i.e., satisfies formula_14. The twist vector measures the extent to which the Killing vector fails to be orthogonal to a family of 3-surfaces. A non-zero twist indicates the presence of rotation in the spacetime geometry.\n\nThe coordinate representation described above has an interesting geometrical interpretation. The time translation Killing vector generates a one-parameter group of motion formula_15 in the spacetime formula_16. By identifying the spacetime points that lie on a particular trajectory (also called orbit) one gets a 3-dimensional space (the manifold of Killing trajectories) formula_17, the quotient space. Each point of formula_18 represents a trajectory in the spacetime formula_16. This identification, called a canonical projection, formula_20 is a mapping that sends each trajectory in formula_16 onto a point in formula_18 and induces a metric formula_23 on formula_18 via pullback. The quantities formula_9, formula_11 and formula_6 are all fields on formula_18 and are consequently independent of time. Thus, the geometry of a stationary spacetime does not change in time. In the special case formula_29 the spacetime is said to be static. By definition, every static spacetime is stationary, but the converse is not generally true, as the Kerr metric provides a counterexample.\n\nIn a stationary spacetime satisfying the vacuum Einstein equations formula_30 outside the sources, the twist 4-vector formula_31 is curl-free,\n\nand is therefore locally the gradient of a scalar formula_33 (called the twist scalar):\n\nInstead of the scalars formula_9 and formula_33 it is more convenient to use the two Hansen potentials, the mass and angular momentum potentials, formula_37 and formula_38, defined as\n\nIn general relativity the mass potential formula_37 plays the role of the Newtonian gravitational potential. A nontrivial angular momentum potential formula_38 arises for rotating sources due to the rotational kinetic energy which, because of mass-energy equivalence, can also act as the source of a gravitational field. The situation is analogous to a static electromagnetic field where one has two sets of potentials, electric and magnetic. In general relativity, rotating sources produce a gravitomagnetic field which has no Newtonian analog.\n\nA stationary vacuum metric is thus expressible in terms of the Hansen potentials formula_43 (formula_44, formula_45) and the 3-metric formula_6. In terms of these quantities the Einstein vacuum field equations can be put in the form\n\nwhere formula_49, and formula_50 is the Ricci tensor of the spatial metric and formula_51 the corresponding Ricci scalar. These equations form the starting point for investigating exact stationary vacuum metrics.\n\n"}

He has a younger brother, Tom, born in 1979. He had piano lessons when he was a teenager but admitted to hating them and never practising pieces because they were all classical music which he found boring.

{"id": "2073714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073714", "title": "Daniel Pedoe", "text": "Daniel Pedoe\n\nDan Pedoe (29 October 1910, London – 27 October 1998, St Paul, Minnesota, USA) was an English-born mathematician and geometer with a career spanning more than sixty years. In the course of his life he wrote approximately fifty research and expository papers in geometry. He is also the author of various core books on mathematics and geometry some of which have remained in print for decades and been translated into several languages. These books include the three-volume \"Methods of Algebraic Geometry\" (which he wrote in collaboration with W. V. D. Hodge), \"The Gentle Art of Mathematics\", \"Circles: A Mathematical View\", \"Geometry and the Visual Arts\" and most recently \"Japanese Temple Geometry Problems: San Gaku\" (with Hidetoshi Fukagawa).\n\nDaniel Pedoe was born in London in 1910, the youngest of thirteen children of Szmul Abramski, a Jewish immigrant from Poland who found himself in London in the 1890s: he had boarded a cattleboat not knowing whether it was bound for New York or London, so his final destination was one of blind chance. Pedoe's mother, Ryfka Raszka Pedowicz, was the only child of Wolf Pedowicz, a corn merchant and his wife, Sarah Haimnovna Pecheska from Łomża then in Congress Poland (that part of Poland then under Russian control). The family name requires some explanation. The father, Abramski, was one of the Kohanim, a priestly group, and once in Britain, he changed his surname to Cohen. At first, all thirteen children took the surname Cohen, but later, to avoid any potential anti-semitism, some of the Cohen children changed their surname to Pedoe, a contraction of their mother's maiden name; this happened while Daniel was at school, aged 12.\n\n\"Danny\" was the youngest child in a family of thirteen children and his childhood was spent in relative poverty in the East End of London, despite their father being a skilled cabinetmaker. He attended the Central Foundation Boys' School where he was first influenced in his love of geometry by the headmaster Norman M. Gibbins and a textbook by Godfrey and Siddons. While still at school, Pedoe published his first paper, \"The geometric interpretation of Cagnoli's equation: sin b sin c + cos b cos c cos A = sin B sin C – cos B cos C cos a\"; it appeared in the \"Mathematical Gazette\" in 1929. He was successful at the \"ten plus\" examination and subsequently won a Scholarship to study mathematics at Cambridge University.\n\nDuring his first three years at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he was a scholar, Pedoe was tutored in mathematics by Arthur Stanley Ramsey, the father of Frank P. Ramsey. He attended lectures by Ludwig Wittgenstein and Bertrand Russell, although he was unimpressed by the teaching style of either great man. Geometry became his main interest and, advised by Henry Baker, he started work on his doctorate and published several papers. In 1935 he took a break from Cambridge and went to the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton where he worked with Solomon Lefschetz.\n\nOn his return to England in 1936, Pedoe was appointed as an assistant lecturer of the mathematics department at the University College, Southampton. More of his papers were published and after(?) 1937, he was awarded his PhD on the strength of his thesis, \"The Exceptional Curves on an Algebraic Surface\", which was based on Henry Baker's work on the Italian theory of algebraic surfaces; he was examined by W. V. D. Hodge and Baker at Cambridge.\n\nIn the late 1930s, Pedoe married Mary Tunstall, an English geographer and the couple had a daughter, Naomi, and identical twin sons, Dan and Hugh, born in December 1939.\n\nBy 1941, Winchester College had lost several teachers to the army and had become unable to meet its teaching commitments. They requested help and Pedoe was asked to assist with the teaching of mathematics. He taught junior and senior classes (the juniors could be unruly) and in the senior class one of the students was Freeman Dyson who showed enormous early talent and was strongly encouraged by Pedoe with extra work and reading. Their friendship lasted more than fifty more years until Pedoe's death in 1998 and Dyson's list of people who have most influenced him begins \"Hardy, Pedoe...\".\n\nIn 1941 a collaboration with W. V. D. Hodge started which lasted some twelve years and included the writing of the huge three-volume work, \"Methods of Algebraic Geometry\". Although the book was originally designed as a geometric counterpart of G. H. Hardy's \"A Course of Pure Mathematics\" it was never intended as a textbook and contains original material. First published in the 1940s, all three volumes were reprinted by Cambridge University Press in 1995.\n\nPedoe published three more papers in 1942: \"A remark on a property of a special pencil of quadrics\", \"On some geometrical inequalities\" and \"An inequality for two triangles\".\n\nIn 1942, Pedoe moved to Birmingham for a lectureship at the University of Birmingham, working mainly in engineering mathematics. The family were not happy there, the local air pollution affected his children and Pedoe did not like the working environment. The professor of mathematical physics at Birmingham was Rudolf Peierls, who was working on the British project to develop the atomic bomb; he suggested to Pedoe that he, Pedoe, should do some war-work. He did so, and worked part-time to improve piston rings so as to emulate German dive-bombing tactics.\n\nIn 1947 he moved to Westfield College, part of the University of London, as a reader in mathematics. Once again, he was unhappy, both from domestic and professional points of view: his salary was insufficient for him to afford to buy a family home and he found the working environment to be \"a strain\".\n\nEncouraged by Mary to look abroad, he was appointed as head of the mathematics department at the University of Khartoum in the Sudan and took up the role in 1952 on trial basis with leave of absence from Westfield College. When Westfield pressed for firm decision, he resigned and stayed at Khartoum for seven years: the length of his contract. It was during this period that he wrote many of his books including \"The Gentle Art of Mathematics\", \"Circles\" and a textbook, \"An Introduction to projective geometry\".\n\nPedoe found the time at Khartoum to his taste; there was a comfortable life-style that allowed him to write and the family joined him each Christmas. Eventually, Mary stayed with him permanently, the children remaining in England.\n\nIn 1959, he was appointed as head of the mathematics department at the University of Singapore by Sir Alexander Oppenheim.\n\nUnwilling to retire at 55, the statutory retirement age in Singapore, he moved again, to Indiana in 1962, to take up a position at Purdue University, near Lafayette. Although the location was somewhat isolated, there was an active social life and he was kept busy. One of the positions he held there was as Senior Mathematician to the Minnesota College Geometry Project, which was to improve geometry teaching in high schools and colleges by making films and writing accompanying books.\n\nAfter two years at Purdue, he was appointed as a professor at the University of Minnesota where he stayed until he retired in 1980, when he was made Professor Emeritus. He won a Lester R. Ford Award in 1968.\n\nPedoe's interest and work continued after his retirement and in 1984 he was approached by Hidetoshi Fukagawa, a high-school teacher in Aichi, Japan. Fukagawa had tried unsuccessfully to interest Japanese academics in San Gaku – Japanese wooden tablets containing geometric theorems which had hung in temples and shrines for around two centuries as offerings to the gods.\n\nA collaboration started which resulted in the publication of the book, \"Japanese Temple Geometry Problems\" by the Charles Babbage Research Centre in Canada. The book succeeded in arousing interest in this uniquely Japanese form of mathematics.\n\nDan Pedoe died in 1998, aged 88, after a long period with failing health. He was survived by his twin sons, Dan and Hugh Tunstall-Pedoe, and six grandchildren.\n\nA collection of Daniel Pedoe's papers and correspondence throughout his life is to be found at the University of Birmingham archive centre.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is probably most noted for his role as the founding Commissioner of the Independent Commission Against Corruption of Hong Kong.\n\nCater served in Royal Air Force fighter squadrons during the World War II. Cater arrived in Hong Kong to work with the British military jurisdiction after the japanese surrender. Cater began his career of civil service in 1946 as a cadet officer in the Fisheries Department, and was made Director of Agriculture and Fisheries in 1964. In 1966 Cater attended the Imperial Defence College in London. He was appointed by then Governor David Trench to lead the team that restored peace and security following the riots in 1967. He became Defence Secretary and Special Assistant to Governor David Trench during the civil unrest in 1967, and subsequently served as deputy Colonial Secretariat (1967-68), Executive Director of the newly established Trade Development Council (1968-70), Director of Commerce and Industry (1970-72), Secretary for Information (1972-73) and the Secretary for Home Affairs in 1973.\n\nCater was instrumental in establishing schools in all of Hong Kong's fishing villages.\n\nIn February 1974, he was delighted to accept appointment to the first Commissionership of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) by Murray MacLehose following the flight of Police Superintendent Peter Godber, who was under investigation at the time regarding several million pounds stashed in Vancouver banks. His widow later revealed that Cater considered at one point leaving the government. She said: \n\nCater was widely respected and much liked in Hong Kong for the way in which he brought the fledgling ICAC to the point where it became strong enough to survive the attacks of vested interests, and of its many enemies both within and without the government. As a result of Cater's vital early direction, the ICAC was able to grow into a body which presided over the (almost total) eradication of corruption, both official (Governmental) and elsewhere, in Hong Kong.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1984, Cater became Hong Kong's Commissioner in London. Afterwards, he joined China Light & Power Co., and became the head of Hong Kong Nuclear Investment Co, a nuclear power station venture at Daya Bay in Guangdong province. He was also a consultant to Bechtel, a US engineering contractor, and Philips.\n\nIn 1995, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Laws) by the University of Bath.\n\nSir Jack was born on 21 February 1922, son of a London policeman.\n\nSir Jack was married to Peggy in 1950. The couple lived most of their life together in Hong Kong, until the late 1990s.

Cater suffered from Alzheimer's disease during the final few years of his life. He died in Guernsey on 14 April 2006, aged 84.\n\nA memorial was held for him in Hong Kong at the St. John's Cathedral on 21 October 2006, attended by many senior officials and prominent figures, \"inter alia\" Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang, Run Run Shaw, David Akers-Jones, former Secretary for Security Alistair Asprey, as well as Raymond Wong and Lily Yam, respectively the then current Commissioner and a former Commissioner of the ICAC.\n\n\n"}

At first the case is being worked on by Fenton Hardy but when he becomes injured he invites his sons Frank and Joe to join him. After overcoming many obstacles the Hardy boys recover the stolen gold and turn the outlaws over to the Sheriff.\n\nThis book was written for the Stratemeyer Syndicate by Leslie McFarlane in 1928. Between 1959 and 1973 the first 38 volumes of this series were systematically revised as part of a project directed by Harriet Adams, Edward Stratemeyer's daughter. The original version of this book was rewritten in 1963 by Alistair Hunter resulting in two different stories with the same title.\n\nThe Hardy Boys head to Montana to help their father who had been working on a case and broke his ribs. They go to the village of Lucky Lode and find a mystery connected to a man they saved, who had been shot by careless hunters in the beginning of the book. The man they saved had his gold stolen; when he was in Lucky Lode mining, he suspected one of his partners who was trying to save the gold had disappeared. When in Lucky Lode, they meet Mr. Burke who owns the general store; they later learn he is a spy called \"Slip Gun\", working for Big Al, the villain. They defeat Big Al who was known as Black Pepper when the man they saved lived in Lucky Lode. While hunting for the hidden gold the Hardy Boys spot a cave, so they head into it to search for clues to where the gold might be, but they run into a pack of wolves before they find any clues and have to find a way to get out of the cave. They also find Bart Dawson is Bob Dodge, the man who flew them to Montana, who is revealed to have had amnesia. They end up recovering the gold and round up all the bad guys in the story.\n\nWhile their father Fenton Hardy is in Montana working on a case of missing gold the Hardy Boys go skating on Shallow Lake with their friends Chet Morton and Jerry Gilroy where they meet Jadbury Wilson, a poor old man who is also a former gold miner from Montana. Wilson tells them his tale of how Bart Dawson, a trusted member of his party, ran off during a gun fight taking four bags of their gold with him for safekeeping but failed to return once the gunfight ended. Upon returning to the Hardy home, with the injured Jadbury Wilson, the Hardy boys receive a telegram from their father requesting that they join him in Montana immediately.\n\nAfter a stranger, claiming to be Mr. Hardy’s lawyer, ushers the boys onto the wrong train, resulting in their being kidnapped and later escaping, the Hardy boys decide to continue their journey in disguise, finally arriving at Lucky Bottom, Montana to meet with their father. He tells them that they are looking for gold which Bart Dawson claims was stolen from him by an outlaw named Black Pepper and his gang. The next day, while searching for the gold, the Hardy boys are attacked by the gang of outlaws; however they manage to escape and return to town for the night. The following day they manage to catch one member of the gang who gives them information about Black Pepper. Upon searching, they discover a cabin used by Black Pepper, and there they find a map to the hidden gold, indicating it is buried in The Lone Tree mine.\n\nWhile exploring the mine the Hardy boys are attacked by a pack of wolves that chase them down another shaft which happens to be the main mine entrance and the first landmark on the map they found in Black Pepper's cabin. Following the map, the Hardy boys recover the gold which leads to them being attacked by Black Pepper himself. They manage to get the upper hand and march back to town with both the outlaw and the gold, to later learn that Bart Dawson had believed Jadbury Wilson was dead and now that he knows differently he is willing to share the recovered gold. Bart Dawson explains that he had not returned with the gold immediately following the first gun fight because he suffered from amnesia caused by a gunshot to his head.\n"}

He later became the second president of the colony which later became Jamestown. He was killed by the Pamunkey Native Americans when he was going to trade with them in 1609.\n\nRatcliffe was born in Lancashire. Many people say he used the alias John Sicklemore, but this was never confirmed. He served as a seaman before going to Virginia, and he may be the Captain Ratcliffe taken prisoner with Sir Henry Cray and Captain Pigott at Mulheim in 1605.\n\nRatcliffe commanded the \"Discovery\" and became a councillor of the Jamestown Colony. The \"Discovery\" was the smallest of all three ships; it had a crew of only 21 men. He became president of the colony upon the deposition of Edward Maria Wingfield on 10 September 1607. Ratcliffe fell out of favour with many colonists after enlisting men to build a governor's house. Many colonists also disagreed with how he handled trade with the natives and how he performed during the food shortages during the summer of 1608. Ratcliffe was removed in July 1608 and succeeded by Matthew Scrivener. During the administration of George Percy, Ratcliffe was sent in October 1609 to build a fort at Old Point Comfort, which was named \"Algenourne Fort\" after one of Percy's ancestors.\n\nRatcliffe worked with explorer John Smith to remove Edward Wingfield from the presidency because he was hiding food for himself that the colony needed. Ratcliffe was elected president and asked Smith to organise work details and expeditions to trade with Native Americans. By January 1608, only 40 colonists were alive, and Ratcliffe and the Council planned to return to England on the \"Discovery.\" Ratcliffe's overgenerous trading provoked Smith to complain that they would soon run out of items to trade. Ratcliffe left office (either by resignation or deposition) in July 1608, two months before the end of his term. At that point, Ratcliffe had lost the faith of the colonists, who accused him of hoarding rations (recent discoveries say that he was hoarding the rations for his sick children). The colonists were also enraged that as they were sick and dying, Ratcliffe ordered they build a capitol in the woods. The colonists dubbed the project \"Ratcliffe's Palace.\" Ratcliffe accompanied Christopher Newport when he sailed from Virginia in 1608. In May 1609, he commanded the \"Diamond\", one of the ships in the Third Supply fleet of Sir Thomas Gates.\n\nIn December 1609, Ratcliffe and 14 fellow colonists were invited to a gathering with the tribe of Powhatan Indians. The Powhatans promised the starving colonists would be given corn, but it was a trap. The colonists were ambushed. Ratcliffe suffered a particularly gruesome fate: he was tied to a stake in front of a fire. Women removed the skin from his entire body with mussel shells and tossed the pieces into the flame as he watched. They skinned his face last and finally burned him at the stake. This story was documented in an eyewitness account that is included in \"The Jamestown Adventure: Accounts of the Virginia Colony, 1605–1614 (Real Voices, Real History)\", edited by Ed Southern.\n\nIn Disney's \"Pocahontas\" (1995), Ratcliffe was portrayed as a greedy and ruthlessly ambitious man, and the film's main antagonist. His character believes that the Powhatan tribe is very barbaric in nature and have hidden gold near the outskirts of Virginia, and he wants to battle the Native Americans for them, despite the fact that there was never any gold in Virginia and that the tribe has their own type of society. Here, he was voiced by David Ogden Stiers. In this adaptation, he is accompanied by the pug Percy (this name derived from the English colonist George Percy) and by his servant Wiggins. He also appeared in the direct-to-video sequel \"\" (1998), where he plans to dupe King James I into allowing him into sending a large navy armada to initiate a genocide against Powhatans by attempting to sabotage the diplomatic meetings between Pocahontas and the king. He is finally exposed for his incompetence and treachery and is imprisoned by King James.\n\n"}

Between 1959 and 1973 the first 38 volumes of this series were systematically revised as part of a project directed by Harriet Adams, Edward Stratemeyer's daughter. The original version of this book was rewritten in 1966 by Anne Shultes resulting in two different stories with the same title.\n\nA series of adventures begins for the Hardy Boys and their friends Chet and Biff after they are invited to spend Christmas vacation on Cabin Island at the invitation of its owner, Elroy Jefferson, as a reward for recovering Jefferson's car in \"The Shore Road Mystery\". While they are collecting the keys to the cabin from Mr. Jefferson they meet Mr. Hanleigh who is interested in purchasing the island. As well, Mr. Jefferson asks the Hardy boys to locate his grandson Johnny who has gone missing.\n\nAs the boys try to enjoy themselves, someone seems determined to spoil their fun. First, two high school dropouts vandalize their loaded ice boat, the \"Sea Gull\", which delays their departure for Cabin Island by a few hours. Once on the island, a ghost-like hooting leads to an innocent and humorous discovery. All their groceries are stolen, and so Frank and Joe head for the coast to purchase new supplies, but not long after, they find the original stock buried in snow. Chet sees a ghost walking through the woods, as well Mr. Hanleigh and the two high school dropouts are seen sneaking around the island, apparently searching for something.\n\nAfter a series of collisions and near misses with the \"Sea Gull\", the Hardys learn that Mr. Hanleigh is the nephew of a former servant of Mr. Jefferson and he is looking for something hidden in the fireplace. A foreign dignitary, who was earlier mistaken for a ghost due to his white robes, reveals that he is seeking a medal that was presented to the grandfather of his nation's ruler, and had been misled by Mr. Hanleigh who was pretending to be Jefferson's representative.\n\nThe Hardy boys find the missing medals hidden in the chimney and also locate Johnny, returning both to Mr. Jefferson who rewards them with a medal for each of them.\n\nWhile riding in their homemade iceboat on the frozen surface of Barmet Bay, Frank and Joe Hardy and Chet Morton discuss their plans for the upcoming Christmas holiday break, and decide to ask if they could rent out the namesake cabin on Cabin Island. However, a mysterious stranger chases them off the island, and on their return to shore, they nearly crash into an iceboat piloted by Ted Carson and Ike Nash, two reckless and obnoxious youths. The boys are later invited to the home of Elroy Jefferson, a man whose car they returned in \"The Shore Road Mystery\", so he can reward them. They overhear an argument between Jefferson, the owner of Cabin Island, and a Mr. Hanleigh, who is constantly trying to buy the titular cabin for large sums of money. Mr. Jefferson initially tries to give them a monetary reward for returning his stolen Pierce Arrow (Jefferson was in Europe when the car was returned), but the boys ask if they can use his cabin for the holidays, which Mr. Jefferson grants them permission for. As time goes by on the island, the boys notice that strange things have been going on, most notably the disappearance of their supplies. Frank and Joe head to a village on the mainland to get more supplies, and end up talking to a storekeeper named Amos Grice. Grice tells the boys that Jefferson had once married a woman who would inherit the valuable Bender stamp collection from her father, and that rumor has it that Jefferson really married her for the stamps, which were turned over to Elroy when she did inherit them. Jefferson built the cabin years ago for his late wife and son to use in the summer, but while it was being constructed the stamp collection vanished along with their servant, John Sparewell, and Mrs. Jefferson died shortly thereafter. It is later revealed that after Sparewell was almost caught with the stamps, he went to Cabin Island to try to return the stamps in secret. However, he hid them in a gap in the chimney, intending to retrieve them the next day, but the gap was mortared up, sealing them up forever. Before Sparewell died, he willed the box of stamps to his nephew, Mr. Hanleigh, with the instructions to return it to Jefferson. Hanleigh had been trying to buy the island and prowl around it to recover the stamps, but never intended to give them back to Jefferson. Neither Hanleigh nor the boys were able to find the stamps, but when a violent storm tears the cabin apart, the box of stamps is miraculously recovered.\n"}

The next day they are hired by Mr. Allen, the president of Stanwide Mining Equipment Company, under the guise of being factory messengers when in fact they are working undercover to investigate missing shipments of expensive mining equipment containing platinum.\n\nThe Hardy boys decide to quit their messenger jobs when it becomes clear that the gang is onto them. Instead they rent a plane and take aerial photographs of the area where their car crash occurred; however, their camera and exposed film are stolen before they have a chance to develop the pictures. Continuing to investigate the theft of their camera, as well as the theft of the mining equipment, they repeatedly see footprints and hear a voice belonging to Clint Hill, an aircraft pilot who is presumed dead after his plane crashed into the ocean, causing them to wonder if his ghost is somehow involved in the thefts.\n\nAfter recovering their pictures the Hardy boys rent a helicopter and return to the area of the car crash, finding a large hidden cave and recovering the stolen shipments of equipment. Next the Hardy boys fly to a small Caribbean island, and then to Montana in pursuit of the criminals.

Clint is revealed to be alive after all, having survived the crash and faked his death.\n\nIn the original version of this story on the way to the new Bayport Airport the boys are almost run over by Mail Pilot Giles Ducroy. Ducroy blames the boys because he lost his job and later he frames the boys for a mail robbery. Although they don't have an alibi they are bailed out of jail by Mr Applegate (from Tower Treasure) and Mr Jefferson owner of Cabin Island(previous book). The Hardy boys overhear Ducroy and two other hoods planning a major air mail robbery. They find out that Ducroy and company bought an airplane and stow in the back of it to follow the hoods. When Ducroy and company try to steal a major payroll the Hardy boys manage to capture the thieves. The real pilot, whose plane was ruined by the thieves, ends up using the crooks' plane to deliver his cargo. The boys graduate from high school. They get rewarded since the info they had sent to their father clears the boys.\n\n\n\n\nThe title of the novel was adopted by the progressive metal band The Great Airport Mystery, whose album \"The Great Spaceport Mystery\" was released May 7, 2013.\n"}

It is located approximately to the south of modern-day Minya in the region known as Middle Egypt, the area between Asyut and Memphis.\n\nWhile there are some Old Kingdom burials at the site, it was primarily used during the Middle Kingdom, spanning the 21st to 17th centuries BCE (Middle Bronze Age).\n\nTo the south of the cemetery is a temple constructed by Hatshepsut and Thutmose III, dedicated to the local goddess Pakhet. It is known as the \"Cave of Artemis\", because the Greeks identified Pakhet with Artemis, and the temple is subterranean.\n\nProvincial governors in the Middle Kingdom continued to be buried in decorated rock-cut tombs in their local cemeteries, carried over from the First Intermediate Period, at sites such as Beni Hasan. There is evidence of a re-organization of the system of government during the 12th Dynasty. During the First Intermediate Period and for some of the Middle Kingdom period it was common for Nomarchs (someone who oversees/controls a government specified area) to be hereditary positions; the elite did not depend on the king to legitimize their power as much as they had in the Old Kingdom. In the 12th Dynasty the power of the Nomarchs began to be curtailed, and provincial governors were appointed or at least confirmed by the king.\n\nThere are 39 ancient tombs here of Middle Kingdom (ca. 21st to 19th centuries BCE) nomarchs of the Oryx nome, who governed from Hebenu. Due to the quality of, and distance to the cliffs in the west, these tombs were constructed on the east bank. There is a spatial distribution in this cemetery (there are two cemeteries here: the upper range and the lower necropolis) associated with the different levels of resources available to the deceased; the most important people were buried near the top of the cliff. In the lower cemetery there are 888 shaft tombs, dating to the Middle Kingdom, that were excavated by John Garstang; for the most part these tombs shared a similar general design which included a small chamber or recess at the foot of the shaft (facing south) to receive the coffin and the funeral deposits.\n\nIn the upper cemetery members of the elite class built striking tombs to represent their social and political positions as the rulers and officials of the Oryx Nome, which is the 16th Nome of Upper Egypt. At this site, the provincial high elite were buried in large and elaborately decorated tombs carved into the limestone cliffs near the provincial capital, located in the upper cemetery area. These tombs lie in a row on a north-south axis. There is a slight break in the natural rock terrace, on to which they open, that divides the thirty-nine high status tombs into two groups. The basic design of these elite tombs was an outer court and a rock-cut pillared room (sometimes referred to as the chapel) in which there was a shaft that led to the burial chamber.\n\nSome of the larger tombs have biographical inscriptions and were painted with scenes of daily life and warfare. They are famous for the quality of their paintings. Nowadays, many of these scenes are in poor condition, though in the 19th century copies were made of several of them.\n\nFour out of the 39 tombs are accessible to the public. Notable tombs are:\n\n\n"}

The original version of this book was rewritten in 1967 by Tom Mulvey resulting in two different stories with the same title.\n\nJoe and Frank are asked by their father Fenton Hardy to break into the house of a scientist and retrieve a secret invention and keep it safe from being stolen while he is away. The brothers successfully retrieve the device while at the same time thwarting an attempted burglary. The device turns out to be a small transistor-type radio with remarkably clear reception; their father sends a message to guard it carefully, so they hide it in the trunk of their car. The next day at an antique airplane show, Chet steps on the toe of a blonde-haired man who becomes angry but flees when an onlooker states that the man was trying to eavesdrop on their conversation. Later, the brothers see the blonde man, who accidentally dumps his briefcase contents when fleeing them.\n\nFrom here the plot parallels in many ways the original plot, with minor changes and updates. At a party at Chet's later that night, the boys observe someone snooping around their car. Joe goes to investigates and disappears as the clock strikes midnight. As in the original, Frank and Chet search for Joe, but the trail eventually grows cold until a tip from Aunt Gertrude (of all people) leads to the caves along the bay off Shore Road. In this version, the bad guys are recast as both jewel smugglers and electronic thieves.\n\nThe New York sequence follows much as in the original version as well, although in 1967 the Hardys are less shy about calling family for help and thus do not have to hitch-hike back to Bayport after being robbed. Once the boys are back to Bayport, they find the gang's head honcho is working at the local jewelry store, and as in the original version they follow him to the airport. The use of bi-planes in the original is maintained in the new version by the device of having the Hardys contact an acquaintance who has an antique plane to help them chase Taffy Marr. Their parachute escape from the plummeting biplane, one of the dramatic set-pieces of the original version, is thus maintained in the new book.\n\nAs in the first book, Marr and the rest of the gang are rounded up late at night on the beach trying to bring in a load of hot diamonds.\n\nThis story opens with Chet Morton giving the Hardy boys and their chums a lesson on how to use the new automat which just opened in their hometown of Bayport. While jostling one another the boys bump into a blonde haired man. Later, while wrestling with the boys from Crabb Corners, Joe Hardy falls against the blonde man again causing him to drop his package which is later revealed to contain diamonds he is smuggling.\n\nThat evening the Hardy boys attend a party at the Morton's farm. While the clock is striking midnight Joe Hardy disappears without a trace. At first Frank thinks his brother is playing a joke on him but when he does not reappear Frank gets worried. A while later Frank and his chums manage to locate Joe who has been kidnapped and kept hostage in a cave along the Shore Road.\n\nThe rest of the story deals with Frank and Joe traveling to New York City to unravel the mystery of the blonde man. In New York they are pick pocketed and have to spend a night sleeping in a park, while listening to the clock strike midnight. While hitchhiking back from New York, the boys meet two Department of Justice men who are investigating a case of diamond smuggling. When they return to Bayport the Hardy brothers locate who they believe to be Taffy Marr, the diamond smuggler. The Hardy boys chase him to the airport and then hire a plane to continue the chase, however the plane they hired has mechanical problems and crashes. After again returning to Bayport they locate Taffy Marr again, and send a message for the Department of Justice men to come and help them make the arrest. Together with help from the Department of Justice men, the Hardy brothers manage to arrest Taffy Marr and the men he's been working with.\n\nThe story concludes with an informal party at the Morton's farm again, with the boys recounting their adventures for their friends, while the clock strikes midnight again.\n"}

He is well known in the Philippines for his close friendship with the writer and Propagandist José Rizal, and the numerous correspondence between the two provide a vital reference for Rizal historians and scholars, including his last letter from prison before the execution.\n\nBlumentritt was born in Prague (now the Czech Republic, then the capital of Kingdom of Bohemia in the former Austrian Empire).\n\nBlumentritt wrote extensively about the Philippines, although he never visited the islands, corresponding with the then Filipino student and writer José Rizal, who later became a national hero. Blumentritt's relationship with Rizal began as early as July 1886. Blumentritt became one of Rizal's closest confidants although they met only once. He translated a chapter of the latter's first book, \"Noli Me Tangere\", into German and wrote the preface to Rizal's second book, \"El filibusterismo\", although he was against its publication as he believed that it would lead to Rizal's death. These two novels are commentaries disguised as fiction which angered both the Catholic Church and the Spanish colonial government, and which eventually led to Rizal's 1896 trial and execution. Before the execution in Manila, Rizal wrote his final letter for Blumentritt. Blumentritt reportedly cried after receiving the letter.\n\nAlongside Rizal, Blumentritt was a significant contributor to the publication \"La Solidaridad\", published by Filipino expatriates from 1889 to 1895 as a voice for advocacy of political reforms in the Philippines. From 1900, Blumentritt was a member of the Berlin Society for Anthropology.\n\nBlumentritt died in Litoměřice (), Bohemia. He is memorialized in the Philippines by numerous public parks and streets. Among them are Blumentritt Road, Blumentritt station (Line 1), Blumentritt railway station, the Blumentritt Market in Metro Manila and the Blumentritt Street in Naga City and Tuguegarao. His relations with Rizal also caused the twin status of the Czech town of Litoměřice with the Philippine towns of Calamba (Rizal's birthplace) and Dapitan (where Rizal was initially exiled).\n\n\n\n\n"}

Upon further exploration they find an unused wing of the home which has recently had locks added to the doors.

While the police thought this resolved the case, the Hardy boys kept an eye on the Purdy house and found a stranger coming to the house, who then runs away after another scream is heard.\n\nWhile investigating the house again the Hardy boys are taken hostage by a crazy old man named Amos and another man who looks almost exactly like Mr. Dalrymple. Surprisingly they are rescued by Mr. Applegate and a bomb, which was attached to the ticking grandfather clock, is safely disarmed. Mr. Dalrymple arrives with the police and Amos falls to his death while trying to escape. The Hardy boys examine the device he was using and solve the mystery of how he managed to deliver the death threats to the secret room, as well they locate stamps which Mr. Dalrymple's doppelgänger had stolen from Mr. Applegate.\n\nA banker named Raymond Dalrymple of Lakeside gets death threats and shows up at the Hardy house, seeking Fenton Hardy's assistance.

Further sleuthing reveals that the thefts are performed in well-known speedboats such as the Hardy's \"Sleuth\".\n\nShortly after, Dalrymple disappears and the Hardys, fearing for their lives, go to the Purdy place to look for him. Then the Hardys are held up by a man named Arthur Jensen, looking similar to Dalrymple, living in his house secretly in hiding. Jensen was a thief who stole small, but valuable things from ships and such. Frank and Joe are bound and gagged, along with an inventor named Amos Wandy, with a time bomb set to go off at 3 a.m. With less than two minutes remaining, a window panel breaks and Chet Morton emerges and unbinds Frank, who then defuse the bomb just seconds before it was supposed to go off. Joe and Wandy are unbound next. Then Jensen is later caught on the Purdy mansion grounds and the valuables are retrieved. Another discovery proves that the death threats to Raymond Dalyrmple are lowered down through the chimney in the jaws of one of Amos Wandy's inventions, which rolls to the middle of the hidden room, then drops the note and is raised up by a wire.\n\nAt the end, Dalrymple throws a surprise party for the boys and gives Mr. Wandy permission to stay in the hidden room and invent whenever he wants.\n"}

Between 1959 and 1973 the first 38 volumes of this series were systematically revised as part of a project directed by Harriet Adams, Edward Stratemeyer's daughter. The original version of this book was rewritten in 1965 by David Grambs, resulting in two different stories with the same title.\n\nFrank and Joe attempt to uncover a plot to smuggle refugees from Baredo in the Huellas (a fictional island nation off the coast of French Guiana) into the United States, and the involvement of local magnate Orrin North. They also get involved with investigating attempts to spy on a top-secret satellite camera being built at a local company called Micro-Eye. Someone has managed to infiltrate security at the plant and has taken photos of blueprints.\n\nRealizing that several clues point to the involvement of people from Baredo, Frank and Joe and their friend Chet Morton fly down to Cayenne, French Guiana, and then go by boat to Baredo in the nearby Huellas to investigate. What they discover is that Orrin North, while supposedly on the side of rebels against the dictator of Baredo, is actually double-crossing the rebels by finding out their identities and capturing them.\n\nReturning to Bayport, the boys overhear a plot to steal the satellite camera the very next day, but they are captured and taken aboard a ship where they are locked into a hold being filled with water. They manage to escape from the hold with the assistance of their father, Fenton Hardy, who has been on the same case and went after this ship at the same time. They free the political prisoners on board, stop the theft at Micro-Eye, and capture the criminals with the assistance of the Coast Guard.\n\nWhen Frank and Joe try to take their laundry to the laundromat in order to clean up the house before Aunt Gertrude arrives, they learn that its owner has disappeared and has been replaced by a sinister Chinaman named Louie Fong. Later that day, the boys go down to the docks to meet their aunt, who mysteriously does not show up. While waiting, they meet a man who introduces himself as Sidney Pebbles, who is invited to spend the night at the Hardy home. The next morning Mr. Pebbles has disappeared, along with some papers from Fenton Hardy's coat pockets, leaving only a set of footprints below the window. That night, they arrive home to find Aunt Gertrude on the floor, ill. She had accidentally overslept and had to arrive on the return voyage, making her a day late. Concerned, they hire a nurse, Mrs. Cody, to take care of her while she recovers. In the following days, the Hardy boys investigate a fight amongst Chinamen at the local docks, as well as meeting Orrin North, who had hired their father to clear his company name under accusations that he is involved in smuggling Chinamen into America to avoid a head tax.\n\nLater, the boys and Orrin North head to a Chinese restaurant named \"Lantern Land\" where Sidney Pebbles is working. To their surprise, a Sidney Pebbles is working there, but is not the same man. They overhear Pebbles talking with Tom Wat, a Chinese man who was stabbed in the dock fight, but miraculously survived, when someone releases a dog to attack Tom. The Hardy boys intervene and save the pair, also trying to help Tom and Sidney. During the course of their investigation, the Hardy boys hide Tom Wat by dressing him up as a woman and hiding him in their home. They also meet the real Mr. Pebbles and realize that they had been fooled by an imposter who lied to them in order to get into their house. The story concludes with the Hardy boys being held prisoner along with their father, until Tom Wat is able to escape and get help, resulting in the people smugglers being arrested and the Hardy boys solving the mystery of who left the footprints under the window.\n"}

The followers of the county side are dubbed Trelawny's Army. In 1991 and 1999 Cornwall made the County Championships finals, played at Twickenham Stadium, with Cornwall beating first Yorkshire and in 1999 Gloucestershire to win the cup.\n\nCornish rugby has produced many fine rugby players who have played at the international level, including Phil Vickery, Trevor Woodman, (both England), Brian 'Stack' Stevens (England and British and Irish Lions), Graham Dawe (England), along with Andy Reed who has represented Scotland and the Lions, and many others.\n\nAlso, the Cornish rugby team can boast an Olympic silver medal. In 1908, they won the County Championship for the first time, and the prize was to represent Great Britain at rugby in the 1908 Olympic Games. They lost to Australia 32-3 in the final, and remain the only county side to represent Great Britain at rugby in the Olympics.\n\nThe Cornwall Rugby Football Union (CRFU) was formed in 1883. It is a union of 37 rugby union clubs which includes most rugby union clubs in Cornwall (St Columba and Torpoint RFC is a member of the Devon Rugby Football Union), the open-age Cornwall representative side and representative teams at various age groups. The CRFU are members of the Rugby Football Union (RFU), the governing body for rugby union in England. The CRFU organises three annual knockout cup competitions – the Cornwall Super Cup, Cornwall Cup and Cornwall Clubs Cup, with the Cornwall Cup stretching back to 1967. The Cornwall Super Cup is played between the Launceston and Redruth (doubling up as National League 2 South league games between the sides), the Cornwall Cup is for teams based between tiers 6 and 12 in the English league system and finally the Cornwall Clubs Cup is for teams in the regional Cornish leagues. The Cornwall Cup used to be the premier competition with the top sides such as the Cornish Pirates, Launceston, Mounts Bay and Redruth taking part but has been superseded in recent years by the Super Cup, itself downsized to just the two teams due to the demands of the modern game both in terms of fixture congestion and the increased physical toll on players. All cups are currently sponsored by Tribute Ales.\n\nThe Cornish rugby tradition has deep roots, stretching back before the game was even codified. A form of folk football, known as Cornish hurling was highly popular there, and is still played in two towns in Cornwall. It is possible that the former popularity of this game paved the way for the rugby code. Their rugby jerseys with gold and black hoops were introduced in 1885.\n\nCornish Rugby has had the honour to have played host to many international touring rugby teams over the years including New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand Māori, France, Romania, the USA, Canada, Japan and the Soviet Union.\nOne of the most important times of the year in a Cornish rugby fan's calendar is the County Championship. Like the 1900 games, three teams entered: Australasia (representing Australia and New Zealand), France, and Great Britain (which included the whole of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). France pulled themselves from the event prior to the commencement of the tournament, being unable to field a representative team. Cornwall won the championship for the first time in 1908, when they played in front of 17,000 fans at Redruth. The game was against Durham, also known for its mining, this time coal not tin. Cornwall won the game 17–3, scoring 5 tries. The added incentive for the winner was the chance to represent Great Britain at the 1908 Summer Olympics. The choice of Cornwall was controversial, as only three of their players had ever represented England, as well as the fact that Australia, who had been on a tour of the United Kingdom, had defeated them 18 points to five.\n\nTwo other countries entered the 1908 Summer Olympics, France and Australasia, the name of a combined team from Australia and New Zealand. France withdrew before the tournament which left Great Britain (Cornwall) playing Australasia. The final score was 32–3 to Australasia with Bert Solomon managing to score a try for Great Britain.\n\nAustralasia's team, the Wallabies, was already on tour in Britain, while the best Anglo-Welsh players were on tour in New Zealand at the time. Great Britain was therefore represented by the Cornwall county team, who were chosen by the RFU as an appropriate side after they defeated Durham in the 1907 English county championship.\nAs expected, Australasia defeated Great Britain, claiming the gold medal, the score being 32 points to three. The match at the White City Stadium was played under poor conditions, in fog and with a slippery field.Olympic 'spirit' too much for Cornwall rugby team against Australia in 1908 by Brendan Gallagher on \"The Telegraph\", 2 Dec 2008</ref>\n\nCornwall reached the Championship final again in 1909, 1928, 1958, 1969 and 1989 but had to wait until 1991 before re-claiming the trophy. In a final that most Cornish fans will remember forever, Cornwall played Yorkshire at Twickenham in front of 54,000 fans, the majority of which were supporting Cornwall. In a game that had everything, from a Cornish point of view, all seemed lost when after 54 minutes, Cornwall found themselves trailing at 16-3 down, having been tricked when Yorkshire ran a penalty that the Cornish believed they had indicated to kick. That one moment changed the course of the game and Cornwall fought back to draw level at 16-16 after 80 minutes. They even missed the conversion that would have given them victory in normal time. The game then went into extra time when Cornwall managed to continue their scoring.\n\nThe final score was 29–20 to Cornwall which sent the Cornish fans into a state of total elation. The Cornish tries were not pretty but no one cared. Richard Nanckivell's two tries were the inspiration that they could win and Tommy Bassett and Billy Peters put the icing on the cake in extra-time. Cornwall's first title since 1908. Cornwall managed to reach the final again in both 1992 and 1998, unfortunately losing both and it was not until 1999 when they met Gloucester in the final that Cornwall managed to win the Championship again.\n\nCornwall play most of their home games at Redruth R.F.C. and Camborne RFC but matches have also been played at Penzance & Newlyn and Launceston.\n\nThe premier club side in Cornwall are the Cornish Pirates (recently renamed from Penzance & Newlyn RFC) who play in the RFU Championship. They are hoping to increase their fanbase by appealing to Cornish nationalist sentiment to help them gain promotion to the Aviva Premiership. Launceston Rugby Club (\"The Cornish All Blacks\") have recently (2007 season) been promoted to the National Division One. Redruth R.F.C. (\"The Reds\") play in National Division Two and also get good support. Mount's Bay have this season 2007–08 began their campaign in National Division Three, South, leading the league for the entire season they are at season end promoted to National Division Two for the 2008/09 season. The other major Cornish club sides who play in the South West 1, 2 West, Western Counties West and Cornwall & Devon leagues are Bude, Camborne, Falmouth, Hayle, Newquay Hornets Penryn, St Austell, St. Ives, Saltash, Truro and Wadebridge Camels.\n\nFethy Po Fyllel An Gwarry Ha Tra Nahen!

The Barbarian players, who normally wear their club socks, all wore black and gold socks to represent Cornwall, in a game which Australia won 11–8.\n\n\nAs of 2019 Cornwall have won the Bill Beaumont Cup (County Championship) six times: 1908, 1991, 1999, 2015, 2016, 2019\nSince 1984 the finals have been played at Twickenham:\n\n\nThere are currently 37 clubs affiliated with the union, most of which have teams at both senior and junior level.\n\nThe Cornwall RFU currently runs the following competitions for clubs in Cornwall:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2073790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073790", "title": "Site of the Claudian invasion of Britain", "text": "Site of the Claudian invasion of Britain\n\nThe site of the Claudian invasion of Britain in AD 43 is a matter of academic debate. Although it is generally believed that the force left from Gesoriacum (Boulogne), it is possible that part of the fleet sailed from near the mouth of the Rhine. And while Rutupiæ (Richborough, on the east coast of Kent) is often stated as the site of the landing (e.g. by Sheppard Frere), there are equally plausible arguments in favour of a landing further west along the south coast of Britain.\n\nThe only contemporary detailed account of the invasion comes from Cassius Dio's \"Roman History\", written in the early 3rd century. He states that the main invasion force under Aulus Plautius sailed in three divisions, and George Patrick Welch argues that there were three landing sites in Kent: Lympne furthest west (the Legio II Augusta under Vespasian), Dover in the centre (the Legio XX Valeria Victrix under an unknown commander) and Richborough in the east (the IX Hispana and XIV Gemina under the overall command of Plautius). The three divisions would have then advanced from the coast and met at the River Medway.\n\nOther historians dispute that the Romans landed in Kent. Dio describes how the troops saw a shooting star whilst at sea and were cheered by this omen. He adds that it travelled from east to west and that this was the direction the Romans were sailing in. However, a voyage from Boulogne to Kent sails from south to north.\n\nTaking Boulogne as the point of departure, historians such as John Morris and J. G. F. Hind have used Dio's account to suggest a landing point much further west along the south coast of Britain, around the Solent or Southampton Water. This is supported by Dio's stated reason for the Roman invasion, that Verica, the king of the Atrebates who lived in the area of modern-day Hampshire, had appealed for Roman assistance after he was expelled in a coup, and by Suetonius's assertion that Vespasian conquered the Isle of Wight.\n\nSimilarly Dio writes of an early victory when the Romans received the surrender of a tribe he calls the \"Bodunni\". No tribe of this name is known, but it is very similar to that of the Dobunni who occupied Gloucestershire. In this case, a landing point in the region of Chichester or Portsmouth might be expected.\n\nThe remains of military storehouses dating to the appropriate period have been found under Fishbourne Roman Palace, a 1st-century Roman villa near Chichester and, on the basis of this, and other archaeological evidence, archaeologist Barry Cunliffe, formerly a proponent of the Kent hypothesis, has stated that he was becoming persuaded by the arguments in favour of a South Coast landing.\n\nOther historians argue that, as the Roman invasion fleet may have numbered as many as 1,000 ships, mostly slow and ungainly troop transports, its commanders would have wanted to minimise the time spent at sea because of the risk of contrary winds, and that this favours the short route to Kent rather than the longer journey up the Channel to the Solent. Richborough had a large natural harbour (long since silted up) which would have provided a suitable anchorage for the landing (though its capacity to hold more than a small part of the fleet has been questioned), and there are archaeological remains of earthworks, interpreted as defensive ditches, dug to protect the anchorage, dating to the period of the invasion. There is also evidence at Richborough of a ceremonial arch, which may have commemorated Richborough's role in the invasion, but as the arch was not constructed until c AD 80, by which time Rutupiæ was the major port of entry into Britain from the continent, its relation to the events of the invasion is uncertain.\n\nThe British defence was led by Caratacus and Togodumnus of the Catuvellauni, an eastern kingdom with influence over Kent, and the Romans' immediate objective seems to have been to secure a crossing of the River Thames in order to reach the territory of the Catuvellauni. The Dobunni, who Dio says were tributaries of the Catuvellauni, could have sent troops eastwards to their aid, who then surrendered to Plautius in Kent. In this scenario, Vespasian's western conquests could have taken place after the Thames crossing was secured.\n\nAccording to Suetonius, Claudius sailed from Boulogne, and it is usually assumed that the main force under Plautius sailed from the same place, but it is possible that Plautius's forces sailed from the mouth of the Rhine, which Strabo names as a point of departure used for crossings to Britain in the early 1st century; ships commonly sailed along the coast of Belgic Gaul to the territory of the Morini, before taking a relatively short open-sea crossing to Britain. This would account for the westward journey in Dio's account. On the other hand, if the Rhine was the point of departure, and if the Catuvellauni were Plautius's objective, it could be argued that a landing south of the Thames would have been unnecessary and have entailed as much risk as a landing north of the river.\n\nThe three divisions mentioned by Dio also leave open the possibility that, while the main landing was in Kent, part of the force sailed to the Solent to aid Verica, or vice versa. Dio, of course, wrote about 150 years after the event, and his sources are unknown; the details of his account are uncorroborated and may be unreliable.\n\n"}

The original version of this book was rewritten in 1961 by James Beuchler resulting in two different stories with the same title.\n\nThe original story contained racial stereotypes which were removed during the revision. For example, the chief villain, a young black man named Luke Jones is described in the 1935 edition as \"the worst scoundrel we have ever come across\", but is completely removed from the 1961 version, and most characters identifiable as black have been reworked as racially ambiguous.\n\nThe Hardy boys meet Mr. Bart Worth who is the editor of the \"Larchmont Record\". He explains that Mr. Samuel Blackstone has sued him for printing a story accusing his ancestors of being pirates. Mr. Worth also tells the Hardy boys about the long-standing feud between the Blackstone and the Rand families over ownership of a pond in Hidden Harbor.\n\nThe Hardy boys accept Mr. Worth’s case and, along with their friend Chet Morton, drive to Georgia. Once they have set up a camp on the beach between the two properties, the boys begin to investigate the Rand and Blackstone estates. They are surprised to find a ‘sea monster’ in the pond and to witness Mr. Rand being hit over the head with a vase by Mr. Blackstone, only moments later to find the vase intact and Mr. Rand missing.\n\nDespite the efforts of their enemies, the Hardy boys manage to find Mr. Rand and recover a treasure chest containing historical records which prove that the accusations Mr. Worth made in his article were all true. The feud is settled when Mr. Rand and Mr. Blackstone decide to work together to harvest the valuable cypress trees from Hidden Harbor.\n\nThe story begins with the Hardy boys and their pal Chet Morton returning to Bayport on a small coast liner from Larchmont where they had procured handwriting samples from Miss Pennyweather for a case on which their father, Fenton Hardy, was working. During a storm, they meet Mr. Samuel Blackstone who tells the boys that he is carrying a large sum of money. Shortly thereafter, the ship runs aground and Mr. Blackstone is knocked down by Mr. Luke Jones and badly hurt. Joe and Chet manage to swim to shore but Frank Hardy goes missing as he stayed behind to assist the injured Mr. Blackstone.\n\nShortly after Frank is located, the three boys are arrested on charges of robbing Mr. Blackstone. The Hardy boys immediately suspect Mr. Ruel Rand of robbing Mr. Blackstone and set out to track him down. Recording the license plate of a car that they see him get into, they learn he lives in Hidden Harbor. The Hardy boys visit the wreck of the \"Resolute\" where they attempt to retrieve the handwriting samples. However, their boat drifts off and they are detained by the Coast Guard before they are able to reach their stateroom. After returning to land, they are questioned by the district attorney at Mr. Blackstone’s bedside. There they learn about the long-standing feud between the Blackstones and the Rands.\n\nChet and the Hardy boys travel south to Hidden Harbor to retrieve new handwriting samples from Miss Pennyworth as well as to investigate who stole Mr. Blackstone’s money. While there, they are followed by a detective and their campsite is vandalized. They also stumble across a ‘secret society’ of young black men being led by Luke Jones, a servant to Mr. Blackstone. This group of Negroes kidnaps Mr. Rand’s mentally insane brother who manages to turn the tables on them by stealing their revolvers. Eventually the Hardy boys manage to find and disarm the brother as well as capture Luke Jones and make him confess to stealing Mr. Blackstone’s money and his diamond ring as well as being responsible for inciting more hatred between the two families. The Hardy boys also manage to gather indisputable evidence which solves their father’s case without the need for replacement handwriting samples.\n"}

The original version of this book was rewritten in 1968 by Tom Mulvey resulting in two different stories with the same title.\n\nThis story begins with Frank and Joe Hardy driving home along Shore Road when they have an accident with a dragster. After they arrive home their father, Fenton Hardy, tells them about a new case he has taken on for Alden Automotive Research and Development Company, with which he would like the boys' help. Mr. Hardy explains that Mr. Alden believes someone is trying to steal the plans for a secret new engine he is designing, and that two of his racing cars which were equipped with new engine had strange accidents in which their windshields suddenly \"crazed\" (turned an opaque white), just after passing a road sign warning “DANGER”. While they are discussing the case, someone fires a smoke grenade into their house with a warning attached, telling them to \"drop the Alden case\".\n\nFrank and Joe start by working undercover at Alden’s shop, while their friend Chet Morton takes an interest in jet propelling his bicycle, which leads to humorous results. At the shop the boys meet Barto Sigor and they learn that he has a twin brother Vilno who recently quit Alden’s employment. The boys immediately suspect that the twins may have swapped spots so that Vilno can gain access to the plans for the new motor. The Hardy boys also meet Roger Alden, Mr. Alden’s son, who seems to have a bad attitude. He is the boys' second suspect.\n\nAunt Gertrude receives news that she has just inherited a farm for retired racing horses. She is horrified at the prospect of owning such a thing, but before she can sell it the Hardy boys go to see the place. When they return they find that Mr. Alden’s racehorse Topnotch has been stolen and is being held for ransom. The Hardy boys return to the farm where they meet with Fowler, the manager of the farm, who tells them to get lost. While there, Frank picks up a cartridge from Fowler’s rifle, which he later matches to the rifle casing used to shoot the smoke grenade into the Hardy home. It is later revealed that Fowler is actually Norman Dodson, and is responsible for the theft of Topnotch. Using their detective skills, the Hardy boys figure out where the horse is being kept. They go there, get captured, but manage to escape while riding Topnotch to freedom.\n\nReturning to the Alden automotive case, they learn that Barto has fled the plant with Mr. Alden's experimental race car. The Hardy boys eventually figure out where Barto is hiding, but when they reach the mansion hideout, they are suddenly \"frozen in their tracks\" by a \"powerful invisible force\". Once captured they find their father has also been trapped, along with Mr. Alden and his son Roger. While they are being held hostage Vilno brags to the boys about his \"sonic trap\" which can trap objects inside using \"hypersonic vibrations\" and he explains how he used his \"hypersonic generator\" to craze the windshields of the race cars. Once Vilno leaves Joe manages to escape from the cabin through an air vent, where Chet Morton arrives on his rocket propelled bike, causing the villains to crash their car between two trees and trapping them inside until the police can arrive to arrest them.\n\nThe original story involves the theft of a famous racehorse, Topnotch. Intertwined are the mysterious and malevolent works of the villain Vilnoff. These two stories are intertwined and the Hardy boys are immersed as they solve the seemingly unlinked mysteries. In this original version, the \"sinister signpost\" is in the form of a glowing hand that turns and points toward the underground lair of the villain.\n"}

He would later be forced to flee to Nancy by the encroachment of the Kingdom of Prussia's soldiers. He exhibited paintings throughout his lifetime at the Paris Salon.\n\nFriant created works in charcoal, oil, and other media. He also used photographs to prepare finished paintings.\n\nFriant was born in the commune of Dieuze in 1863. His father was a locksmith and mother a dressmaker. The wife of a chemist, Madame Parisot would hire the wife of Émile Friant's father to design custom clothing. The Parisots took an early interest in the young Friant and treated him maternally, as they were without children of their own.\n\"La Petite Barque\"\nWith the defeat of the Second French Empire at hand, as part of the then-ongoing Franco-Prussian War, Dieuze was no longer under state control. Intensely distressed by this, Parisot intended to leave the commune for Nancy, but died shortly before having the chance. In 1871, Madame Parisot fled with Friant to Nancy; his biological family would follow later.\n\nFriant was sent to the \"lycée\" to learn Latin, as Madame Parisot intended for him to follow in her husband's footsteps and become a chemist. Meanwhile, friends of his biological father had suggested sending him to a municipal school of art because of his skill with the brush. Because of his poor work at the lycée, Friant requested permission to leave and focus on his art. His father agreed, and the young Friant was placed under the guide of a private tutor who would arrange his academic work so that time remained for painting. Under the guidance of Louis-Théodore Devilly, director of a school in Nancy and a proponent of realism, Friant learned the art of still life and landscape painting.\n\nFriant painted \"La Petite Barque\" at the age of 15. It was exhibited in Nancy and quickly became the center of public intrigue. The municipal council granted him permission to travel to Paris a year later. There, he studied under Alexandre Cabanel, who tutored him in creating oil sketches of historical works. Friant, becoming disenchanted by the academic style of the atelier method, returned to Nancy.\n\nIn 1882, Aime Morot, a friend of Friant, encouraged him to debut two of his works at the Salon: \"The Prodigal Son\" and \"Studio Interior\", for which he received an honourable mention. The following year, Friant again presented at the Salon and took second place in the Prix de Rome concours. In 1884 he received a third class medal at the Salon with his painting \"Un coin d'atelier\" and in 1885 a second-class medal. He would form a lasting friendship with the actors Ernest and Benoit Coquelin. With the travel grant he received from the Salon of 1886, Friant traveled to and studied in the Netherlands. His portrait of the Coquelins' mother reflects the influence of that trip. In 1889 he exhibited his 1888 painting \"La Toussaint\" at the Salon, for which he received a first prize. This painting depicts a revanchist patriotic image of a group of people visiting a cemetery in which the French victims of the Franco-Prussian War were buried. He received a gold medal for the same painting at the Universal Exposition of 1889, as well as the Legion of Honour. The painting was acquired by the State and added to the collection of the Luxembourg and is now on permanent display in the Musée des beaux-arts in Nancy. He received a second gold medal from the jury at the Universal Exposition in 1900, where he exhibited five paintings including \"La Discussion politique\", \"Jours heureux\" and \"La Douleur\".\n\nFriant was appointed a professor of painting in 1923 at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France, promoted to the position of commander in the Legion of Honor, and made a member of the Institut de France. In 1932, Friant fell to his death in Paris.\n\n\n"}

Mr. Mudge tells them that he would like to purchase the \"Sea Spook\". The boys decide to go to pick up their girlfriends Callie and Iola from a movie at the Bijou but as they arrive they see a man wearing the disguise of the Goggler Gang running away with the cashbox. They catch the man but he escapes before the police arrive. Later, the boys travel up the river in the ‘’sleuth’’ to speak to Mrs. Lunberry, the owner of a Jeweled Siva which was recently stolen, on behalf of their father who is going to take on the case. Upon returning they are summoned to Doc Grafton’s Health Farm by their chum Chet Morton, who has taken summer employment there. During the course of their travels they keep seeing suspicious vehicles, specifically brand new greenTorpedo sedans. When they get to the health farm Chet tells them that he has learned that someone is going to kidnap them and leaves them in suspense until Callie and Iola arrive and Chet says that they are kidnapping them to go to a beach party. The clue about the green Torpedo leads them to Izmir Motors, owned by Malcolm Izmir. The boys try to get to the door of Mr. Izmir’s house but are attacked by his guard dogs and have to climb a tree to escape. The butler finally comes outside and calls the dog and the Hardys get to talk to Malcolm Izmir who had been receiving threatening notes. Upon returning home they find their house has been burglarized and their fathers safe blown open and Aunt Gertude tied and gagged with a note that calls her a blabber mouth.\nThey learn from Chief Collig that the Bijou holdup man was actually Nick Cordoza, and that he had broken into Mr. Izmir’s house, but Mr. Izmir had refused to press charges. The boys also learn from Mr. Mudge that the Izmir syndicate has gone broke. They also suspect that Doc. Grafton’s resort is actually a hideout for crooks who are getting plastic surgery to alter their looks, based on Chet’s report that he saw a mummy in an off-limits building on the Health Farm and their guess that Mr. Izmir is the head of the Goggler Gang because his name can be shortened to Mal I, which may mean ‘evil eye’. Fenton Hardy goes undercover at the resort while Chet and the Hardy boys investigate by sneaking on to the Health Farm. They all end up captured by Spotty Lemuel and Rip Sinder. They are rescued when Chet calls the police, who arrest the villains and several other crooks that were staying at the Health Farm.\n\nThe boys (Frank, Joe, and Chet) go see a movie called \"A Figure in Hiding\" at the local Rialto Theater. After the film is over, the Rialto is robbed, with the thief getting away with $900. Then the boys go to the Bayport Hotel and meet up with their father, Fenton Hardy. They spy on a pair of men (Rip Sinder and Spotty Lemuel) in the room next door, part of a cruel gang called the \"Eye Syndicate\", run by a bogus doctor named Grafton performing fraudulent eye operations on unsuspecting victims. While Sinder and Lemuel are preparing letters to prospective victims, Sinder's daughter barges in and begs him to come home. Lemuel, trying to get her to leave, reveals to her that she was adopted, something that Sinder had kept secret from her. This works and Virginia runs away in a fit of despair and sorrow. Not long after that, the police mistakenly arrest their friend Chet for the robbery. It was really committed by Nick Cordoza, whom the boys found in his car unconscious. Chet runs away to Boston instead of going back home, following directions from a note supposedly from the Hardy boyss to go there and wait for them. Later, their father devises a plan to trap Grafton by telling one of his clients (Henry Zatta) to pay with marked bills. However, the plan falls apart after Grafton recognizes his long lost father, causing him to flee and leave behind the $500 in marked money. Eventually, the boys find Virginia at an auto garage, where they attempt to prevent her from escaping, only to be caught in an auto accident. Grafton and his mute assistant Zeb find them and attempt to bury them alive but the Hardy boys fight them off. The boys are able to make it out of Grafton's cellar and the police show up to arrest the criminals. When the case is solved, Virginia is reunited with her grandmother, one of the victims of Grafton's fraudulent medical operations.\n"}

Between 1959 and 1973 the first 38 volumes of this series were systematically revised as part of a project directed by Harriet Adams, Edward Stratemeyer's daughter. The original version of this book was rewritten in 1966 by James D. Lawrence resulting in two different stories with the same title.\n\nOn a stormy night, the Hardy boys receive a visit from Captain Early who tells them the story of Red Rogers, the ‘Jolly Roger’, and Whalebone Island, where he is said to haunt. The next day, the boys receive a map in the mail showing a red 'X' on Whalebone Island. They assume this is a treasure map so they, along with their friend Chet Morton, go to meet their father and explore the island. As they approach, they see the abandoned lighthouse flashing a warning to them in Morse code. On the island, they find their father who tells them about a solid gold bust of an Egyptian Pharaoh which was owned by Mr. Zufar. While it was being shipped to America aboard a freighter named \"Katawa\", the ship sank and Mr. Zufar is making an insurance claim for one million dollars. However, the insurance company has received a tip that the head was not on the ship when it sank and Mr. Zufar is trying to defraud them.\n\nThe Hardy boys end up on the salvage ship that is sent to search the \"Katawa\", which happens to be sunk very close to Whalebone Island. While they are on board, they notice another salvage ship in the area as well. Once the diver is lowered to the sunken ship, he finds that someone else has already been there and stolen some of the ship’s equipment. On a later dive, the diver is nearly killed when a squid triggers a booby trap that was intended for him.\n\nThe boys leave the salvage ship when they receive notice that their father has gone missing. They return to shore and locate their father and the missing Pharaoh’s head and put a stop to a plan by Mr. Zufar to sell the real head while also collecting the insurance for the head which was supposedly sunk. In the end, while the bad guys nearly capture them, the rival divers come to their rescue, having earlier revealed that they were searching for a U-boat sunk by Captain Early during World War II. As a result of an earlier rescue the boys performed, the divers were going to give them a share of the treasure and had come to do so when they found them in trouble. While the mystery is solved, the boys discover that the money the other divers were after is actually counterfeit.\n\nThe Hardy Boys meet up with a professional diver by the name of Roland Perry, who is employed by the Crux Brothers diving company. After the boys rescue Perry from a mishap on the water, they loan him one of their father's suits, and Perry heads off to his next job at nearby Bailey's Landing. But the suit happened to contain important notes for the case that the elder Hardy was working on, so he sends the boys to retrieve them. Along the way, they run afoul of two thugs, Bock and Simon.\n\nAfter retrieving the notes, the boys stick around to help Perry raise a yacht belonging to a wealthy businessman. In the process, they become entangled in Perry's bitter feud with another diver, Gus Kuntz, the unscrupulous owner of a rival diving company. Kuntz employs the thugs Bock and Simon, and repeatedly tries to sabotage Perry's diving operations, putting Perry's and the boys' lives at risk. Mysterious notes left at the Hardys' hotel serve as the eponymous secret warnings, foretelling misfortune, but the boys are undaunted.\n\nAt length the yacht is raised, and Perry moves on to his next job: searching for treasure in the sunken ocean liner \"Katawa\" off of Reed's Point. They enlist the aid of eager photographer and inventor Earl Chipsley and his remarkable underwater X-ray motion picture camera. But the second mate of the \"Katawa\", Clark Hornblow, institutionalized after having gone mad at the time of the wreck, insists the riches are elsewhere, having been stolen by other officers using a lifeboat. What's more, Kuntz and his henchmen will stop at nothing to claim the gold and diamonds for themselves. The Hardys are beset by dangers above and below the surface of the sea as they attempt to secure the \"Katawa\"'s fantastic treasure.\n"}

The original version of this book was rewritten in 1969 by Tom Mulvey resulting in two different stories with the same title.\n\nWhile their father Fenton Hardy is working on cases of museum robberies, he asks Frank and Joe to stake out the \"Black Parrot\", a shipping boat docked in Bayport. The Hardy boys get a job loading crates aboard the ship but because the crew is so unfriendly and are kept very busy, they don’t have a chance to investigate. They instead decide to follow another lead and travel to New York to search for a rare old book. While scouring a used book store, they locate a book titled \"Empire of the Twisted Claw\" which bears a symbol on the cover which matches a ring the first mate of the \"Black Parrot\" was wearing. While they cannot afford to purchase the book, the store keeper allows them to read it, whereby they learn about the Empire of the Twisted Claw and the pirate ships named \"Black Parrot\" and \"Yellow Parrot\" and the King who controlled the empire.\n\nAs the investigation continues, the Boys and their father learn that the thieves are targeting the DeGraw collection and will likely rob six more museums. They stand guard at one of the museums but when the thieves strike, they use a sleeping gas knocking the boys out. Following up on a lead, they find where the \"Black Parrot\" has docked again and watch while the crew loads about a dozen logs on board and the ship immediately leaves port. The Hardy boys then track down the \"Yellow Parrot\" where they take jobs to get aboard and look around. While investigating more of these strange logs in the storeroom, the logs break free and Frank must hang from the roof to avoid being crushed.\n\nWhen they learn that the \"Yellow Parrot\" is going to meet up with the \"Black Parrot\", the boys realize that they must escape. They jump ship and swim to a strange island where they meet an eccentric man who lives on that island. They escape the island by hitching a ride with a pilot who is a friend of the island man, and thus they can return home. Later, they receive a radio call from someone on the \"Yellow Parrot\" who is trying to help them. The boys fly to the source of the signal and find the ship hidden near the strange island. Initially they are captured but manage to escape while learning why the crooks desire the DeGraw collection and capture the masterminds behind the robberies.\n\nFamous detective Fenton Hardy informs his sons, Frank and Joe, that a clever, dangerous gang of smugglers is operating in their part of the country and the government must defeat it. He may need their help, in a hurry, and reminds them of the secret code he has given them which he will use to summon them quickly if need be. Frank and Joe do not tell him that Frank's wallet, containing the code, has been lost.\n\nIn the meantime he asks the boys to search for an out of print book on criminology.\n\nAs Fenton packs to depart on his mission, Frank notices that the house is under surveillance. Fenton takes his departure in disguise so that he won't be followed. Soon after he leaves, an attempt is made to break into the house, but Frank and Joe scare off the intruder.\n\nThe next day they go out in search of the criminology book their father asked them to find. They find it in a used book store and also run across a curious volume called \"Fifty Thousand Dead Men\", by a pirate captain. They head home with both books.\n\nAt home they receive a call from a stranger, one Pierre, who has an exaggerated French Canadian accent, claiming to represent their father and demanding the delivery of his papers to a seedy bar in the water front district. There follows several attempts by Pierre to trick the boys into turning over their father's papers, including the use of the secret code after Frank's wallet is mysteriously returned. As each attempt is countered, the boys follow Pierre back to a tramp schooner, the \"Black Parrot\", being loaded for departure. After surveying the ship and overhearing a sailor report that he had gotten the papers, they head back home.\n\nAt home, they find their Aunt and the housekeeper tied up and their father's papers stolen. Remembering the comments they overheard on the \"Black Parrot\" regarding “the papers”, they hurry to the ship, only to find it has departed. They give chase in their speedboat, but run out of gas and the schooner gets away. Interrogating the clerk at the shipping office gives them little to go on except the vague information that the \"Black Parrot\" often plies the logging camps along the Canadian coast.\n\nBack home again, the boys’ mother returns from a trip and relates to them a strange message from their father that was received by the hotel clerk. Using the code sheet, Frank a Joe determine that the message mentions “fishing boat” and instructs them to go to the Canadian woods. They conclude that their father has been kidnapped and was only able to leave an incomplete message. They resolve to travel to the Canadian woods, explore around the lumbering camps to find their father and maybe the \"Black Parrot\". They leave their friend, Chet, to watch over and protect the household.\n\nOn the train Frank reads the pirate book and discovers that the pirate, one Captain Gronger, has a pet parrot that broke his leg and ended up with a twisted claw. The pirate captain adopts a twisted claw as his insignia.\n\nOnce in Canada they travel into the woods to a lumber town, Woodsville, on the outskirts of the lumber country. Arriving at night, they check into a rustic boarding house / hotel and are assigned a room to be shared with two other boarders. Upon encountering the Hardys, the two boarders are immediately startled and they bolt and run. The Hardys give chase but the two get away. One of them resembles the intruder they confronted back home.\n\nSubsequent inquires reveal that the larger of the two is young Jim Hoskin, the arrogant, boastful, ne’er-do-well son of old Jim Hoskin. Setting out for old Jim Hoskin’s cabin, they encounter and confront young Jim and his shorter companion, a sailor. After a brief fight, the two get away again.\n\nWaiting until dark to reconnoiter, Joe heads out alone, while Frank gets some more sleep. In the dark a car silently coasts through the village, its engine cut. Joe jumps onto the back and hangs on in order to follow the suspects. While hanging on, he hears Jim and the sailor gripe about Pierre, who acts as if he were the Claw King himself. When the car hits a bump, Joe is injured and is discovered. The two tie him to a log at the top of a log jam in a river, so when the jam is cleared he will be swept away and crushed to death.\n\nAwaking, and realizing that Joe has been gone far too long, Frank sets out to find him. Following his foot prints and then the car’s tire tracks, he comes to where Joe was captured. He hears Joe crying for help, and rescues him from the log jam in the nick of time. Stumbling across a nearby lumber camp, they receive food and medical attention. One of the men identifies Jim Hoskin’s companion as Slim Wetzel.\n\nBack at the hotel, they call home to their friend Chet, who has been watching over the house in their absence. He tells them another attempt was made to break in, and when he dusted for fingerprints, one of them looked like a claw.\n\nThey decide to press deeper into the lumber country and make the rounds of all the lumber camps in order to find their father. On horseback, they head to a neighboring village. From a couple of locals they learn that Young Jim and Slim Wetzel had been in the area trying to obtain sleeping powder to take care of a “maniac” in their company. The “maniac”, lying in the back seat of the car, was moaning and raving something about “frogs climb double trees”.\n\nThe Hardy's suspect the “maniac” is their father, feigning craziness and trying to convey a message through the code. Consulting the code, they determine that the police should raid some place in the woods, but the code does not provide a translation for “double trees”. They surmise it to be a reference to a lumber camp name and find a “Twin Spruce Camp” nearby on their map. They head for the camp.\n\nNear the camp they are attacked by a large wolf-dog. After fending off the attack, they observe a man dragging the wolf-dog into a cabin. They suspect that their father is being held prisoner there. They decide to call on the Canadian Mounted Police for assistance and ride to the nearby headquarters. Sergeant Johnson tells them that the camp has been closed for four years and no-one should be there. At a gallop, all three ride back to the camp.\n\nAs they sneak up on the cabin, they are again attacked by the wolf-dog, but Sergeant Johnson uses a weighted net to trap and dispatch it. Breaking into the cabin they discover and confront Young Jim and Slim Wetzel. Overcoming them, they tie them up, and the Sergeant leaves with the men, leaving Frank and Joe to guard the cabin until he returns.\n\nExploring, Joe discovers a hidden room upstairs, and breaking into it, discovers his father in very poor condition, too weak even to talk. They provide their father a stimulant, and Frank relates that while Sergeant Johnson was tying up the prisoners, he noticed that they both had twisted claws branded on the tips of their index fingers.\n\nFenton relates the story of his capture just after leaving the message the boys received from their mother and how he feigned being delirious and used his ranting to try to convey a message to them. As they talk, they notice that the forest around them is on fire, and that they are trapped.\n\nAs the fire closes in on the cabin, all hope of escape seems cut off. Suddenly, a charging horse and rider burst through the wall of flames, and Sergeant Johnson dismounts. He quickly gives them direction on how to direct their horses through the fire and straps Fenton to his mount. After penetrating the firestorm safely, they head back to the village. At the village, Fenton receives medical attention.\n\nThey decide to give Chet another call for an update. Chet tells them that while investigating the \"Black Parrot\", he has found out that there are a number of Parrot boats, each named with a different color. Frank concludes that the smuggling gang has read the pirate book they picked up, and have been using it as a guide.\n\nFenton summons the boys and tells them that Sergeant Johnson overheard the prisoners discussing a boat named the \"Black Parrot\" due to dock at a small port town, Little Cove. Fenton directs them ship out on the boat in order to solve the case. They travel to Little Cove.\n\nIn Little Cove they find that the \"Black Parrot\" has not yet arrived. They then spy Pierre, and follow him back to a large house. In the morning they procure seaman’s clothing as a disguise, and binoculars. They stake out Pierre’s house and, using the binoculars, are able to distinguish a claw mark on his index finger.\n\nThe next morning, the \"Black Parrot\" arrives and Frank and Joe head to the water front in their disguises to sign up for the crew. As luck would have it, when the boys approach the first mate he has just fired two rowdy crew members and hires them on the spot. They report to the ship the next morning and are put to work right away. In the course of their labor, Frank observes the twisted claw print on the Captain's finger and Joe overhears the Captain and Pierre say that they are sailing to King Barracuda’s Island for a meeting of all the King’s subjects from the world over.\n\nJoe notices that the Captain is an enthusiast for solitaire card games and manages to engage him with new games and strategies. Frank cozies up to “Sparks” the radio operator. Joe gets the opportunity to covertly search the Captain’s cabin and finds one of his father’s missing papers. A note scribbled on it reports that Jim Hoskin had put Fenton out of the way, and was signed by Pierre.\n\nThe crew notice that the Hardys have been trying to get friendly with the officers and confront them. One of them sarcastically mentions that Joe has been doing card tricks for the Captain. Impulsively, Joe demands a card deck and starts performing impromptu magic tricks. The crew is astonished and entertained by Joe’s feats of prestidigitation and they win the crew over.\n\nThe crew asks the boys to do them a favor and to try to find out from the Captain where the ship is headed. They have observed signs of bad luck and doom, and believe that only by getting to land soon will they break the spell. Frank promises to ask the Captain and let them know. When they observe Pierre going to the Captain's cabin, they eavesdrop and hear the Captain tell him they will make Barracuda Island six days off. But before they can report back, the crew mutinies and locks the Captain and other officers in the brig.\n\nFrank and Joe take the opportunity to search Pierre’s cabin and find a report that details an amazing record of world-wide smuggling activities. The boys realize that if the mutiny is successful they will not be able to get to Barracuda Island and break the smuggling ring. They resolve to stop the mutiny.\n\nA ferocious storm arises; the mutineers squabble amongst themselves and prove incapable of handling the situation. The ship is near sinking and chaos reins. In the confusion, Frank get the key to the brig and frees the officers. They quickly take charge and the crew, fearing death, follows orders and fights to save the ship. In the end, the ship suffers heavy damage but survives, and the Captain is again in full control. The leaders of the mutiny are rounded up and locked in the brig.\n\nA few days later, the ship makes landfall at Barracuda Island, but the crew are disappointed to learn that they are strictly forbidden from going ashore. After the Captain, Pierre, and a few officers depart, the Hardys slip overboard and swim ashore.\n\nOn the island they encounter a resident and are nearly exposed, but they convince him to keep their presence a secret. From him we learn that the island consists of three classes: an indigenous population of brown-skinned, loincloth-clad “natives”; a European population that are descendants of shipwreck survivors who are largely ignorant of the “outside world” and of the smuggling activities; and a ruling class led by the Barracuda King, which conducts various illegal enterprises around the world.\n\nThe boys blend into the population and observe various festivities associated with arrival of the fleet for the yearly meeting with the King. They learn that there will be a parade that will welcome and escort the Captains and officers of each ship to the King’s castle where they will report on their activities and receive recognition for their successes. The Hardys use the general commotion as the parade advances towards the castle to slip past the gate and gain entrance to the castle. Cautiously exploring, the secrete themselves in an empty chamber with a balcony overlooking the audience hall and the King’s throne.\n\nFrom their hiding place, they witness the induction of the new recruits into the “Order of the Twisted Claw”. Each initiate has the twisted claw insignia ceremonially branded on his forefinger with a poker heated in a cauldron of boiling oil.\n\nThe King is then ready to accept the reports from each of the ships crews but first severely questions Pierre and the Captain concerning the absence of Young Jim and Slim, and are even threatened with death for having allowed them to disappear and thus endanger the Order. Pierre lies and tells the King they perished in the forest fire. The King reserves judgment until he hears their report.\n\nWhen it is their turn, Pierre and the Captain astound the gathering with the scope of their smuggling activities and their profitability. They provide details of how they use hollow logs and false papers to smuggle luxury goods into the United States and turn a profit on them. The King forgives the disappearance of Young Jim and Slim, and awards them the grand prize, a large chest of gold coins.\n\nThe Hardys have seen enough and sneak out of the castle and swim back to the ship. Their absence had been noted by the officer in charge, but they make up a tall tale about taking a swim and being attacked by barracudas. The credulous crew backs them up in their story and is entertained by the boys as they elaborate on their adventure.\n\n“Sparks”, the radio operator, prevails upon Frank to help him fix the wireless outfit; Frank winds a new coil and gets it working. The Captain and Pierre return to the ship, and in a chance encounter with him, Pierre eyes them suspiciously. The boys suspect they have been recognized, and as precaution, Frank tells Sparks that the coil needs more work and disconnects it. Shortly after, Pierre confronts them and has them tossed into the brig.\n\nThe brothers decide that their only hope is to play on the crew’s resentment towards the Captain and incite another mutiny. They find out that the Captain has rationed some of the gold coins to the men and so they are not going to turn against him. Changing tactics, Joe plays on their superstitious nature and tells one of the crew that the Captain is going to kill them, which will curse the ship and it will sink, drowning all aboard. The terrified seaman rushes to tell the rest of the crew. He returns and informs them that the crew is afraid of being punished and won’t engage in a second uprising. Just then, one of the officers appears and herds them to the Captain’s cabin. As a last desperate chance, the boys raise a commotion yelling out “Don’t kill us!”. The crew, eavesdropping outside, becomes fearful, breaks down the cabin door, and removes the Captain, Pierre and the officers to the brig.\n\nNow free, the brothers see their chance to use the wireless to summon help. Sparks feigns ignorance of the situation and requests that the coil be restored. Frank seems to oblige, and as soon as Sparks thinks the radio is fixed, turns on them and attempts to summon the other Parrot ships to put down the mutiny. But Frank only pretended to comply and the radio does not function. The crew imprison Sparks in the brig.\n\nWith the radio fixed, the Hardys attempt to summon help, but a storm arises and the static makes it impossible to know if their messages are getting through. After repeated attempts to relay a message, the radio gives out without receiving any reply.\n\nOne of the crew informs them that they have decided to change course and head for the Mediterranean in order to avoid prosecution for mutiny, and are even considering freeing the Captain, who has promised to double their money and make sure they are not punished. Just then, the lookout on the mast spots a ship steaming towards them. The radio messages got through and it is a U.S. revenue cutter. A shot is fired across the bow and a boarding crew takes over the ship. Fenton Hardy is aboard the cutter and congratulates his sons on a job well done.\n\nA worldwide alert is given, and any officers of the Parrot vessels with the claw insignia are being arrested. A contingent of American warships seize the island and capture the King of Barracuda. Back home, the Hardys travel to Washington for the official investigation, and confront the deposed king. They show him the pirate book and he confesses that the author was his grandfather, and that he always regretted losing it and feared that it would be his undoing.\n"}

Being a laboratory school, it also serves as a training ground for future teachers graduating on UFRJ.\n\nFounded in May 20, 1948, the school was located in a building by the beach of Botafogo, yielded by Fundação Getulio Vargas. From 1952 to 1962 the school remained in another building in São Salvador square granted by the state government, and in 1962 it was transferred to its current location. Despite being a small school, CAp was, in the mid-1960s, one of the strongest references on student activism, the main force of resistance against the Brazilian military dictatorship.\n\nCAp is located on J.J. Seabra street, in the neighbourhood of Lagoa, South Zone of Rio de Janeiro. The building it occupies today is not federal - it belongs to the state government, and was landmarked by the city mayor for being one of the few horizontal constructions on Lagoa. It is in a rather bad condition, but the lack of government funding and these special conditions have contributed to making it quite difficult to have any effective restorations.\n\nOn May 2005, a wall collapsed on one of the classrooms. It was a holiday, so the school was empty and no one was hurt. This triggered a rise on funds available for restorations on 2006, but some projects had to be delayed because of problems on the structure of the building.\n\nThere is a request from the student body regarding giving CAp a building of its own. Most people suggest it could be located inside the UFRJ campus at Urca, but unfortunately this is not a priority for the federal government as it would demand too many resources.\n\n\"Colégio de Aplicação\", literally \"Application School\", means that the school is used as a training or research ground for UFRJ student-teachers.\n\nStudents of CAp UFRJ may engage in research projects at UFRJ through NICJr. (\"Núcleo de Iniciação Científica Jr.\", \"English: \"Junior Scientific Initiation Nucleus\"\").\n\nAs of 2008, classes on CAp are available from 1st grade of Ensino Fundamental (roughly equivalent to Elementary and Middle School) to the 3rd grade of \"Ensino Médio\" (roughly equivalent to High School). Students from the first five years have classes in the afternoon, and the rest in the morning, the only exception being the final year, in which there are classes in the afternoon in addition to the morning ones.\n\nThere are admission draws for the 1st grade, in which 50 students enter the school, being divided in 2 classes of 25, on the 6th grade of \"Ensino Fundamental\", with 10 vacancies, dividing students in two classes of 30 each. On the 1st grade of \"Ensino Médio\" (9th grade), when 30 more students join the school, making it three classes of 30 students.

The original version of this book was rewritten in 1964 by James D. Lawrence resulting in two different stories with the same title.\n\nUK version published by William Collins Sons & Co. Ltd. as The Mystery of the Disappearing Floor, Volume 5, in 1971.\n\nThe Hardy boys are asked by their father, Fenton Hardy, to assist him in solving a case involving a notorious jewel thief, Noel Strang, and his accomplices. Initially, they spot Strang's car and attempt to follow it until the car drops a purple smoke bomb and the Hardys are forced to pull over. While returning home from the car chase, they run into their friend Chet Morton who was in the woods rock collecting when he heard weird screams. When they go to investigate, they find a strangely tiled floor in the woods and nearby an injured man suddenly revives and runs off. Their adventure continues with a stolen amethyst, a bomb damaging their boat the \"Sleuth\", and a savage looking hound which turns out to be an electrified scare device.\n\nWhen Aunt Gertrude hears where the boys found Chet, she tells them that they were close to Old Man Perth’s house where strange deaths have happened. The owner of the Perth Mansion, Jerome Perth, was a business tycoon who made many enemies due to his swindles. When he died his nephew, Clarence Perth, inherited the house. Shortly after moving in, the servants awoke during a night to him screaming and he was found on the floor of his bedroom with a fractured skull, saying \"Th..the Floor!\", before dying. The door and the windows of the room were all locked from the inside, so the mystery of how he died was never solved.\n\nThe Hardy boys identify a pilot who may be helping the thieves, so they walk into his hangar to examine his plane. Armed with a miniature camera, Joe snaps a picture of a map found in the plane. This leads them to a cabin hidden in the woods in a small bight named Tigers Bight. Unfortunately, the boys don’t have a chance to investigate the cabin as their family friend Jack Wayne crashes his plane \"Skyhappy Sal\" nearby and is injured. After rescuing Jack, the boys return to the Perth mansion where they find the jewel thieves hiding out and tricking a professor, Aden Darrow, into making a ‘freeze ray gun’ for them.\n\nAfter more investigation, the Hardy boys manage to figure out that Clarence died by accident due to the 'disappearing floor' in his bedroom. Unfortunately, the boys are captured before they can tell anyone, but luckily due to Strang's bragging, they are informed about how the gang has been using the freeze ray guns to stun security guards and steal the jewels. Strang explains how they rigged an elevator to go to the wrong floor where they had set up a fake office in order to receive a special shipment of diamonds without arousing any suspicion until they were safely away in the Haley Heist. Eventually Fenton Hardy reaches the Perth Mansion with the police and rescues his sons, arresting the thieves.\n\nThe boys help bring a gang of bank robbers to justice.\n\nIn the television series, \"The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries\", the story is completely rewritten. In it, the boys are asked by their father to help him keep surveillance on an employee of a technology firm who have hired for a case. However, their participation is complicated when they follow him to an isolated property and are beset with a number of strange experiences, beginning with a UFO sighting, that make them doubt their senses.\n"}

Historian Bernard Lewis describes the meaning of \"futūḥ\" within classic Islamic thought:\n\nThese were not seen as conquests in the vulgar sense of territorial acquisitions, but as the overthrow of impious regimes and illegitimate hierarchies, and the \"opening\" of their peoples to the new revelation and dispensation... The use of the root \"ftḥ\" is thus not unlike the 20th century use of the verb \"liberate\", and is indeed sometimes replaced by the latter verb (\"ḥarrara\") in modern Arabic writing on early Islamic history. The Arabic verb \"ghalaba\", \"conquer\", with its connotation of overwhelming by means of superior force, is sometimes used in early accounts of the Muslim conquests, but only in the context of actual military operations...Underlying this usage, clearly, is a concept of the essential rightfulness or legitimacy of the Muslim advance and the subsequent illegitimacy of Muslim retreat before infidel conquest... The advance of Muslim power is thus an opening or a liberation, to give free scope to this divinely implanted propensity.\n\nMany histories from the classical period of Islamic civilization dealing with the early conquests have \"futūḥ\" in their title and are considered to form their own genre of literature, called \"futūḥ\" reports. Like many other histories from the early period, the futūḥ reports contain a mixture of genres and material, with some clearly of an administrative, religio-legal, philosophical, or edificatory nature. For example, a common feature of the genre is an account of the opposing ambassador's first impression of the Arab army in which he remarks favorably upon the primitive virtues of these early Muslim warriors, thus implicitly criticizing the luxury and over-refinement of the author's own time.\n\nThe following is a partial list of these histories:\n\n\nThe impact of the \"futūḥ\" conquests was immense, not least of all on the conquerors themselves, who incorporated many features of the advanced cultures they absorbed into what eventually became classic Islamic civilization.\n\nAmong the conquered peoples, the upheavals: Islamization and Arabization. The former occurred as Islam became a society's regnant religio-political framework. The latter occurred as Arab customs and the Arab language became widely adopted by a population. Though the two developments often occurred in tandem, the expression of one did not necessarily mean the expression of the other. Many Middle Eastern Christians, for example were Arabized but never Islamicized, while the Persians were Islamicized but did not Arabize.\n\nOf the two upheavals, Islamization had the greater impact on social and cultural identity. In all cases Islamization led to a people's near total rejection of their pagan, pre-Islamic past, such that their ancestral achievements and heritage were either forgotten or actively denigrated. When in the 19th Century European Orientalists began recovering this past, their findings were at first ignored by the Muslim residents of the Near East:\n\nThough this alienation may be partially explained by the Arab cultural imperialism implicit in Islamization (as exemplified in the adoption of the Arabic script, for example), there is a more direct theological rationale for this, which is the Islamic concept of jahiliyyah, or state of ignorance and barbarity which supposedly prevailed in pre-Islamic Arabia. Readily applied by the first Islamicized peoples to their own pagan pasts, it led them to view these epochs as times of rampant impiety, ignorance, and injustice from which little of value could be gleaned.\n\nThus one trope of converted Muslims' perception of their own history is the depiction of the pre-Islamic political order as one of rampant exploitation and tyranny, with rulers ordering society according to malign whim rather than in humble subordinance to God's beneficent law for mankind:\n\nAnd in Islamic Persia, \"Chosroes\", from the great Persian king Khosrau II, became as strong a by-word for tyrannical pagan kingship as \"Pharaoh\" (though ironically the pagan destroyer of the Achaemenid Empire, Alexander the Great, was lionized thanks to an accident of Qur'anic textual sources).\n\nSuch hostile depictions of the pre-Islamic political order are a necessary complement to the ideology of \"futūḥ\": in order for the Muslim conquests to be seen as liberatory, the social orders which they replaced had to be depicted as negatively as possible.\n\nWith the rejection of the pre-Islamic political order came the\nrejection of its cultural legacy as well, often expressed by the iconoclastic destruction of its\nmonumental remains as in the recent demolition of the Buddhas of Bamyan. In Egypt, for example, the missing nose of the Great Sphinx of Giza was broken off by a fanatic Sufi when he saw the local farmers making offerings to the Sphinx. And in Iran:\n\nThe popular dissemination of Orientalist discoveries led to a revision of these attitudes, however, and at least a partial reassertion of pre-Islamic identities. In Egypt, the works of native scholars such as Rifā'a Rafi' al-Tāhtawī led to renewed interest in the Pharaonic past and helped give rise to Egyptian national identity movements such as Pharaonism. Though initially derided by other Arabs as \"tafar'un\" (meaning lapsing into pharaonism), the Egyptian movements were in time emulated elsewhere:\n\nThe acceptance of classical Islam's interpretation of the \"futūḥ\" conquests by the Islamicized/Arabized peoples of the Near East and beyond varies.\n\nIt has been least contentious among the Arab countries of Asia, where identity with the original Arab conquerors is strongest. In modern Arab historiography there has been a trend (in part due to the influence of Western-style nationalism), to portray the earliest conquests as liberations of Arabs (or proto-Arabs) from Sassanid/Byzantine imperial domination:\n\nIn North Africa, a reassertion of ethnic and linguistic identity among Berbers called Berberism has recently developed.\n\nDespite a rich pre-Islamic political and cultural heritage, attempts at a reassertion of national identity in Iran have often met with strong resistance:\n\nWith the overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1979, traditional notions of identity returned to Iran, as can be seen by the unabashed embrace of the classic \"futūḥ\" interpretation of Persian history in the propaganda of the Iran–Iraq War:\n\nAcceptance in Pakistan of \"futūḥ\" \"salvation history\" can be seen in current expressions of alienation from both the political as well as cultural legacies of its pre-Islamic past:\n\nAn interesting cultural adaptation found mainly here, though, is the widespread claim of descent from the Arab (or Moghul) conquerors:\n\nThe psychic relation of \"converted\" (i.e. non-Arab) Muslims to Islam is the subject of V. S. Naipaul's literary travelogues \"Among the Believers\" and \"\".\n\n\n"}

He is best remembered for his screenplay for \"In the Heat of the Night\", for which he won an Academy Award in 1967, and for creating the television series \"Naked City\" and \"Route 66\". Other features as screenwriter include the Irwin Allen productions \"The Towering Inferno\" and \"The Poseidon Adventure\".\n\nBorn in Detroit, Michigan, Sterling Silliphant was named for his father, Sterling Silliphant, a Canadian who immigrated to the United States in 1911, becoming a US citizen in 1916. His mother was Ethel M. Silliphant. He had one brother, Leigh, who was three years younger. The family moved to Glendale, California when the brothers were young.\n\nHe graduated from Hoover High School and subsequently, from the University of Southern California.\n\nSilliphant was a film and television writer with more than 700 hours of prime-time television drama to his credit, many of which earned Emmys for their producers, directors, and cast members. However, he never received an Emmy personally as writer. \"Time\" in 1967 referred to him in a feature article with the statement: \"The moving finger...having written, moved on!\" \n\nProduction manager Sam Manners called him from the road unit of \"Route 66\" from El Paso, Texas. He told Stirling they could save perhaps $100,000 if Stirling could write an extra story for the show that could be shot in El Paso while the production trucks and crew were there. Silliphant obliged, and had the script ready in a couple of days. The guest star was Albert Dekker, who was flown in to portray his part over the weekend. \n\nAlthough he worked constantly in Hollywood, he had a well-known aversion against living in Southern California, where he had grown up. After he became successful, he built a house in Tiburon, California and commuted regularly by air to Los Angeles. \n\nDuring World War II, Silliphant served as a lieutenant in the United States Army. Upon his discharge in 1946 in the earlier part of his career, he was publicity director for Walt Disney, and was lead writer on the stories incorporated into \"The Mickey Mouse Club\". He produced several independent films such as \"5 Against the House\" with Kim Novak, \"Huk!\" and \"Maracaibo\". Later he broke into television, writing for the live \"Playhouse 90\". \"Perry Mason\" and \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" soon followed. \n\nSilliphant was known for his involvement in two TV series of the sixties, \"Route 66\" and \"Naked City\". Silliphant was quoted as saying that a number of his \"Naked City\" scripts were far superior to the script that won him the Oscar for \"In the Heat of the Night\". He adapted eight half-hour episodes of \"Naked City\" into a tie-in paperback as well, which was published in 1959. One of his later series creations was \"Longstreet\", which featured a blind detective played by James Franciscus, who had also starred in the first season of \"Naked City\".\n\nHe wrote three television miniseries: \"Pearl\" (about the attack on Pearl Harbor), \"Space\" (based on the James Michener novel about America's early space program), and \"\". He wrote the script for a never-produced TV miniseries of \"Atlas Shrugged\", the novel by Ayn Rand. \n\nSilliphant wrote or co-wrote 47 feature films, including \"Maracaibo\" (produced and directed by and starring Cornel Wilde); the Jacques Tourneur noir \"Nightfall\"; \"Village of the Damned\"; the Charles Bronson spy thriller \"Telefon\", \"The Liberation of L.B. Jones\" (director William Wyler's final film); \"The Killer Elite\" (directed by Sam Peckinpah); the Dirty Harry crime drama \"The Enforcer\" and the arm wrestling story \"Over the Top\" (the latter with its star Sylvester Stallone).\n\nIn addition to the Academy Award, \"In the Heat of the Night\" also earned Silliphant an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America, for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. He helped to pull film concepts together. He penned the screenplay for \"Shaft in Africa\", the third film in the \"Shaft\" series. With Chatrichalerm Yukol, he co-wrote the screenplay to the 1994 Thai action film, \"Salween\".\n\nHe was a close friend of Bruce Lee, under whom he studied martial arts. Lee was featured in the Silliphant-penned detective movie \"Marlowe\" and four episodes of the series \"Longstreet\". Silliphant reportedly recommended Lee for action choreography work. They had been working on a philosophical martial arts script, \"The Silent Flute\" (later known as \"Circle of Iron\"), which was to star Lee and James Coburn, and the pre-production even went to the extent of all three going to India on an unsuccessful location hunt. India was selected because Warner Brothers could not repatriate money their films generated in India due to foreign exchange regulations. The Siliphant, Coburn and Lee project was greenlit on the condition that the film would be shot in India to use the money unused in Warner's India accounts.\n\nSilliphant's last screenplay was for the 1995 film \"The Grass Harp\".\n\nSilliphant had a son, Loren (June 18, 1950 – February 12, 1969), with actress Patricia Wymore. Loren was shot and killed at age 18 by Chester Allen Johnson, who was found guilty of first-degree murder. Loren Silliphant was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.\n\nIn 1974, Silliphant married Tiana Alexandra Du Long, with whom he had two children, Stirling and Dayle.\n\nActor and martial arts expert Bruce Lee was a martial arts student and a friend of Silliphant. Silliphant got interested in Lee's specialities and with other fellow actor James Coburn they worked on developing \"The Silent Flute.\" Silliphant later penned several projects that included Lee and his abilities, the first \"Marlowe\" (1969) where Lee plays Winslow Wong a hoodlum well versed in martial arts, Lee also did fight choreographies for the film \"A Walk in the Spring Rain\" (1970), and Lee played Li Tsung a Jeet Kune Do instructor who teaches it to the main character in the tv show \"Longstreet\" (1971), included in the script were elements of his martial arts philosophy.\n\nSilliphant died in 1996 in Bangkok, Thailand, where he had resided since 1988.\n\nHis work papers are archived at University of California, Los Angeles's Westwood campus.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2073846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073846", "title": "Malmquist bias", "text": "Malmquist bias\n\nThe Malmquist bias is an effect in observational astronomy which leads to the preferential detection of intrinsically bright objects. It was first described in 1922 by Swedish astronomer Gunnar Malmquist (1893–1982), who then greatly elaborated upon this work in 1925. In statistics, this bias is referred to as a \"selection bias\" or \"data censoring\". It affects the results in a brightness-limited survey, where stars below a certain apparent brightness cannot be included. Since observed stars and galaxies appear dimmer when farther away, the brightness that is measured will fall off with distance until their brightness falls below the observational threshold. Objects which are more luminous, or intrinsically brighter, can be observed at a greater distance, creating a false trend of increasing intrinsic brightness, and other related quantities, with distance. This effect has led to many spurious claims in the field of astronomy. Properly correcting for these effects has become an area of great focus.\n\nIn everyday life it is easy to see that light dims as it gets farther away. This can be seen with car headlights, candles, flashlights, and many other lit objects. This dimming follows the inverse square law, which states that the brightness of an object decreases as , where is the distance between the observer and the object.\n\nStarlight also follows the inverse square law. Light rays leave the star in equal amounts in all directions. The light rays create a sphere of light surrounding the star. As time progresses, the sphere grows as the light rays travel through space away from the star. While the sphere of light grows, the number of light rays stays the same. So, the amount of light per unit of surface area of the sphere (called flux in astronomy) decreases with distance and therefore time. When observing a star, only the light rays that are in the given area being viewed can be detected. This is why a star appears dimmer the farther away it is.\n\nIf there are two stars with the same intrinsic brightness (called luminosity in astronomy), each at a different distance, the closer star will appear brighter while the further will appear dimmer. In astronomy, the apparent brightness of a star, or any other luminous object, is called the apparent magnitude. The apparent magnitude depends on the intrinsic brightness (also called absolute magnitude) of the object and its distance.\n\nIf all stars had the same luminosity, the distance from Earth to a particular star could be easily determined. However, stars have a wide range in luminosities. Therefore, it can be difficult to distinguish a very luminous star that is very far away from a less luminous star that is closer. This is why it is so hard to calculate the distance to astronomical objects.\n\nTypically, when looking at an area of sky filled with stars, only stars that are brighter than a limiting apparent magnitude can be seen. As discussed above, the very luminous stars that are farther away will be seen, as well as luminous and faint stars that are closer. There will appear to be more luminous objects within a certain distance from Earth than faint objects. However, there are many more faint stars: they simply cannot be seen because they are so dim. The bias towards luminous stars when observing a patch of sky affects calculations of the average absolute magnitude and average distance to a group of stars. Because of the luminous stars that are at a further distance, it will appear as if our sample of stars is farther away than it actually is, and that each star is intrinsically brighter than it actually is. This effect is known as the Malmquist bias.\n\nWhen studying a sample of luminous objects, whether they be stars or galaxies, it is important to correct for the bias towards the more luminous objects. There are many different methods that can be used to correct for the Malmquist bias as discussed below.\n\nThe Malmquist bias is not limited to luminosities. It affects any observational quantity whose detectability diminishes with distance.\n\nThe ideal situation is to avoid this bias from entering a data survey. However, magnitude limited surveys are the simplest to perform, and other methods are difficult to put together, with their own uncertainties involved, and may be impossible for first observations of objects. As such, many different methods exist to attempt to correct the data, removing the bias and allowing the survey to be usable. The methods are presented in order of increasing difficulty, but also increasing accuracy and effectiveness.\n\nThe simplest method of correction is to only use the non-biased portions of the data set, if any, and throw away the rest of the data. Depending on the limiting magnitude selected, there may be a range of distances in the data set over which all objects of any possible absolute magnitude could be seen. As such, this small subset of data should be free of the Malmquist bias. This is easily accomplished by cutting off the data at the edge of where the lowest absolute magnitude objects would be hitting the limiting magnitude. Unfortunately, this method would waste a great deal of good data, and would limit the analysis to nearby objects only, making it less than desirable. (Looking at the figure to the right, only the first fifth of the data in distance could be kept before a data point is lost to the bias.) Of course, this method assumes that distances are known with relatively good accuracy, which as mentioned before, is a difficult process in astronomy.\n\nThe first solution, proposed by Malmquist in his 1922 work, was to correct the calculated average absolute magnitude (formula_1) of the sample back to the true average absolute magnitude (\"M\"). The correction would be\n\nTo calculate the bias correction, Malmquist and others following this method follow six main assumptions:\n\nObviously, this is a very ideal situation, with the final assumption being particularly troubling, but allows for an approximate correction of simple form. By integrating the luminosity function over all distances and all magnitudes brighter than \"m\",\n\nwhere A(m) is the total number of stars brighter than m. If the spatial distribution of stars can be assumed to be homogeneous, this relation is simplified even further, to the generally accepted form of\n\nThe traditional method assumes that the measurements of apparent magnitude and the measurements from which distance is determined are from the same band, or predefined range, of wavelengths (e.g. the H band, a range of infrared wavelengths from roughly about 1300–2000 nanometers), and this leads to the correction form of \"cσ\", where \"c\" is some constant. Unfortunately, this is rarely the case, as many samples of objects are selected from one wavelength band but the distance is calculated from another. For example, astronomers frequently select galaxies from B-band catalogs, which are the most complete, and use these B band magnitudes, but the distances for the galaxies are calculated using the Tully–Fisher relation and the H band. When this happens, the square of the variance is replaced by the covariance between the scatter in the distance measurements and in the galaxy selection property (e.g. magnitude).\n\nAnother fairly straightforward correction method is to use a weighted mean to properly account for the relative contributions at each magnitude. Since the objects at different absolute magnitudes can be seen out to different distances, each point's contribution to the average absolute magnitude or to the luminosity function can be weighted by 1/V, where V is the maximum volume over which the objects could have been seen. Brighter objects (that is, objects with smaller absolute magnitudes) will have a larger volume over which they could have been detected, before falling under the threshold, and thus will be given less weight through this method since these bright objects will be more fully sampled. The maximum volume can be approximated as a sphere with radius found from the distance modulus, using the object's absolute magnitude and the limiting apparent magnitude.\n\nHowever, there are two major complications to calculating V. First is the completeness of the area covered in the sky, which is the percentage of the sky that the objects were taken from. A full sky survey would collect objects from the entire sphere, 4π steradians, of sky but this is usually impractical, both from time constraints and geographical limitations (ground-based telescopes can only see a limited amount of sky due to the Earth being in the way). Instead, astronomers will generally look at a small patch or area of sky and then infer universal distributions by assuming that space is either isotropic, that it is generally the same in every direction, or is following a known distribution, such as that one will see more stars by looking toward the center of a galaxy than by looking directly away. Generally, the volume can be simply scaled down by the percentage actually viewed, giving the correct number of objects to volume relation. This effect could potentially be ignored in a single sample, all from the same survey, as the objects will basically all be altered by the same numerical factor, but it is incredibly important to account for in order to be able to compare between different surveys with different sky coverage.\n\nThe second complication is cosmological concerns of redshift and the expanding universe, which must be considered when looking at distant objects. In these cases, the quantity of interest is the comoving distance, which is a constant distance between two objects assuming that they are moving away from each other solely with the expansion of the universe, known as the Hubble flow. In effect, this comoving distance is the object's separation if the universe's expansion were neglected, and it can be easily related to the actual distance by accounting for how it would have expanded. The comoving distance can be used to calculate the respective comoving volume as usual, or a relation between the actual and comoving volumes can also be easily established. If z is the object's redshift, relating to how far emitted light is shifted toward longer wavelengths as a result of the object moving away from us with the universal expansion, D and V are the actual distance and volume (or what would be measured today) and D and V are the comoving distance and volumes of interest, then\n\nA large downside of the volume weighting method is its sensitivity to large-scale structures, or parts of the universe with more or less objects than average, such as a star cluster or a void. Having very overdense or underdense regions of objects will cause an inferred change in our average absolute magnitude and luminosity function, according with the structure. This is a particular issue with the faint objects in calculating a luminosity function, as their smaller maximum volume means that a large-scale structure therein will have a large impact. Brighter objects with large maximum volumes will tend to average out and approach the correct value in spite of some large-scale structures.\n\nMany more methods exist which become increasingly complicated and powerful in application. A few of the most common are summarized here, with more specific information found in the references.\n\nThis method is based on the distribution functions of objects (such as stars or galaxies), which is a relation of how many objects are expected with certain intrinsic brightnesses, distances, or other fundamental values. Each of these values have their own distribution function which can be combined with a random number generator to create a theoretical sample of stars. This method takes the distribution function of distances as a known, definite quantity, and then allows the distribution function of absolute magnitudes to change. In this way, it can check different distribution functions of the absolute magnitudes against the actual distribution of detected objects, and find the relation that provides the maximum probability of recreating the same set of objects. By starting with the detected, biased distribution of objects and the appropriate limits to detection, this method recreates the true distribution function. However, this method requires heavy calculations and generally relies on computer programs.\n\nPaul Schechter found a very interesting relation between the logarithm of a spectral line's line width and its apparent magnitude, when working with galaxies. In a perfect, stationary case, spectral lines should be incredibly narrow bumps, looking like lines, but motions of the object such as rotation or motion in our line of sight will cause shifts and broadening of these lines. The relation is found by starting with the Tully–Fisher relation, wherein the distance to a galaxy is related to its apparent magnitude and its velocity width, or the 'maximum' speed of its rotation curve. From macroscopic Doppler broadening, the logarithm of the line width of an observed spectral line can be related to the width of the velocity distribution. If the distances are assumed to be known very well, then the absolute magnitude and the line width are closely related. For example, working with the commonly used 21cm line, an important line relating to neutral hydrogen, the relation is generally calibrated with a linear regression and given the form\n\nwhere P is log(line width) and α and β are constants.\n\nThe reason that this estimator is useful is that the inverse regression line is actually unaffected by the Malmquist bias, so long as the selection effects are only based on magnitude. As such, the expected value of P given M will be unbiased and will give an unbiased log distance estimator. This estimator has many properties and ramifications which can make it a very useful tool.\n\nAdvanced versions of the traditional correction mentioned above can be found in the literature, limiting or changing the initial assumptions to suit the appropriate author's needs. Often, these other methods will provide very complicated mathematical expressions with very powerful but specific applications. For example, work by Luri et al. found a relation for the bias for stars in a galaxy which relates the correction to the variance of the sample and the apparent magnitude, absolute magnitude, and the height above the galactic disk. This gave a much more exact and accurate result, but also required an assumption about the spatial distribution of stars in the desired galaxy. While useful individually, and there are many examples published, these have very limited scope and are not generally as broadly applicable as the other methods mentioned above.\n\nAnytime a magnitude-limited sample is used, one of the methods described above should be used to correct for the Malmquist bias. For instance, when trying to obtain a luminosity function, calibrate the Tully–Fisher relation, or obtain the value of the Hubble constant, the Malmquist bias can strongly change the results.\n\nThe luminosity function gives the number of stars or galaxies per luminosity or absolute magnitude bin. When using a magnitude-limited sample, the number of faint objects is underrepresented as discussed above. This shifts the peak of the luminosity function from the faint end to a brighter luminosity and changes the shape of the luminosity function. Typically, the volume weighting method is used to correct the Malmquist bias so that the survey is equivalent to a distance-limited survey rather than a magnitude-limited survey. The figure to the right shows two luminosity functions for an example population of stars that is magnitude-limited. The dashed luminosity function shows the effect of the Malmquist bias, while the solid line shows the corrected luminosity function. Malmquist bias drastically changes the shape of the luminosity function.\n\nAnother application that is affected by the Malmquist bias is the Tully–Fisher relation, which relates the luminosity of spiral galaxies to their respective velocity width. If a nearby cluster of galaxies is used to calibrate the Tully–Fisher relation, and then that relation is applied to a distant cluster, the distance to the farther cluster will be systematically underestimated. By underestimating the distance to clusters, anything found using those clusters will be incorrect; for example, when finding the value of the Hubble constant.\n\nThese are just a few examples where the Malmquist bias can strongly affect results. As mentioned above, anytime a magnitude-limited sample is used, the Malmquist bias needs to be corrected for. A correction is not limited to just the examples above.\n\nSome alternatives do exist to attempt to avoid the Malmquist bias, or to approach it in a different way, with a few of the more common ones summarized below.\n\nOne ideal method to avoid the Malmquist bias is to only select objects within a set distance, and have no limiting magnitude but instead observe all objects within this volume. Clearly, in this case, the Malmquist bias is not an issue as the volume will be fully populated and any distribution or luminosity function will be appropriately sampled. Unfortunately, this method is not always practical. Finding distances to astronomical objects is very difficult, and even with the aid of objects with easily determined distances, called standard candles, and similar things, there are great uncertainties. Further, distances are not generally known for objects until after they have already been observed and analyzed, and so a distance limited survey is usually only an option for a second round of observations, and not initially available. Finally, distance limited surveys are generally only possible over small volumes where the distances are reliably known, and thus it is not practical for large surveys.\n\nThis method attempts to correct the bias again, but through very different means. Rather than trying to fix the absolute magnitudes, this method takes the distances to the objects as being the random variables and attempts to rescale those. In effect, rather than giving the stars in the sample the correct distribution of absolute magnitudes (and average absolute magnitude), it attempts to 'move' the stars such that they would have a correct distribution of distances. Ideally, this should have the same end result as the magnitude correction methods and should result in a correctly represented sample. In either the homogeneous or inhomogeneous case, the bias is defined in terms of a prior distribution of distances, the distance estimator, and the likelihood function of these two being the same distribution. The homogeneous case is much simpler and rescales the raw distance estimates by a constant factor. Unfortunately, this will be very insensitive to large scale structures such as clustering as well as observational selection effects, and will not give a very accurate result. The inhomogeneous case attempts to correct this by creating a more complicated prior distribution of objects by taking into account structures seen in the observed distribution. In both cases though, it is assumed that the probability density function is Gaussian with constant variance and a mean of the true average log distance, which is far from accurate. However, this method is debated and may not be accurate in any implementation due to uncertainties in calculating the raw, observed distance estimates causing the assumptions to use this method to be invalid.\n\nThe term 'Malmquist bias' has not always been definitively used to refer to the bias outlined above. As recently as the year 2000, the Malmquist bias has appeared in the literature clearly referring to different types of bias and statistical effect. The most common of these other uses is to refer to an effect that takes place with a magnitude limited sample, but in this case the low absolute magnitude objects are overrepresented. In a sample with a magnitude limit, there will be a margin of error near that boundary where objects that should be bright enough to make the cut are excluded and objects that are slightly below the limit are instead included. Since low absolute magnitude objects are more common than brighter ones, and since these dimmer galaxies are more likely to be below the cutoff line and scattered up, while the brighter ones are more likely to be above the line and scattered down, an over-representation of the lower luminosity objects result. However, in modern-day literature and consensus, the Malmquist bias refers to the effect outlined above.\n"}

{"id": "2073856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073856", "title": "Palanga", "text": "Palanga\n\nPalanga (; , is a seaside resort town in western Lithuania, on the shore of the Baltic Sea. It is the busiest summer resort in Lithuania and has beaches of sand (18 km, 11 miles long and up to 300 metres, 1000' wide) and sand dunes. Officially Palanga has the status of a city municipality and includes Šventoji, Nemirseta, Būtingė and other settlements, which are considered as part of the city of Palanga.\n\nAccording to a legend, there was a pagan shrine at the foot of a hill in Palanga where a beautiful priestess named Birutė used to tend the ceremonial fires. Having heard of Birutė's beauty, Kęstutis, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, came to make her his wife. It is written in the Lithuanian Bychowiec Chronicle that Birutė \"did not consent, and answered that she had promised the gods to remain a virgin as long as she lived. Kęstutis then resorted to take her by force, and with great pomp brought her back to his capital, Trakai, where he invited his kinsmen and celebrated with a lavish wedding...\" Kęstutis was later murdered and Birutė returned to Palanga and resumed serving at the shrine until her death. The legend claimed that she was buried in the hill which is now named after her.\n\nNot far from Šventoji, archaeologists discovered an encampment which indicates that the area was inhabited some 5,000 years ago. Between the 10th and 13th centuries Palanga had been one of the main settlements of Mēguva Land, inhabited by the Curonians. Situated upon the trail of the ancient Amber Road, it became a center of trade and crafts.\n\nIn historical documents the name of Palanga was first mentioned in 1161 when the King Valdemar I of Denmark disembarked there with his army and captured the castle of the Curonians.\n\nBetween the 13th and 15th centuries, the inhabitants of Palanga had to confront the Teutonic Knights in the south and the Livonian Brothers of the Sword in the north. Their adversaries were unable to achieve their goal of capturing the Lithuanian sea-coast from Klaipėda to Šventoji. Although Klaipėda (Memel) passed into the hands of the German feudal lords under the Treaty of Melno, in 1422, Palanga and Šventoji remained under Lithuanian control. The two towns gradually developed into harbours and even greater centers of trade. British merchants established enterprises in Šventoji in 1685. During the Great Northern War, the Swedish Army ravaged Palanga, destroyed the harbour at Šventoji, and blocked up the entrance with rocks in 1701.\n\nAfter the Third Partition of Poland in 1795 Lithuania became a part of Russian Empire. In 1819 Palanga came from Vilna Governorate to Grobin County of Courland Governorate.\n\nPalanga was purchased in 1824 by Count Michał Tyszkiewicz. His grandson Józef Tyszkiewicz built a pier and engaged ships to transport passengers and bricks to nearby Liepāja. Palanga began to develop as a resort in the early 19th century. The pier has been a favourite spot for taking a stroll and other recreation since 1892. Józef Tyszkiewicz's son, Feliks Tyszkiewicz, commissioned the construction of the neo-renaissance Tiškevičiai Palace, built by the famous German architect Franz Schwechten in 1897. The French landscape architect Édouard André designed a large park around the palace, between 1897 and 1907. The palace became a favourite gathering place for concert performances. Amongst the good friends and associates of Feliks Tyszkiewicz was the notary, Jonas Kentra.\n\nFollowing the Lithuanian press ban of 1864, Palanga became an important location for the smuggling of Lithuanian publications from the west. The Rev. Marcijonas Jurgaitis, physician Liudas Vaineikis, and notary Jonas Kentra, played significant roles in this activity. After Kentra obtained official permission, a public performance featuring the comedy, \"America in the Bathhouse\" (\"Amerika pirtyje\"), was performed in the Lithuanian language. This had previously not been permitted. However, later the Tsarist authorities deported Vaineikis and twenty-five other people to Siberia in 1901.\n\nIn 1919, after the breakup of the Russian Empire, Palanga became a part of Latvia, like the rest of the Courland Governorate. In 1921 the town was peacefully transferred to Lithuania following a Lithuanian-Latvian treaty and giving Lithuania access to the sea.\n\nIn June and August 1941, hundreds of local Jews were executed in the Forest of Palanga.\n\nThe Tiškevičiai Palace's park was converted into a botanical garden in 1960. Today it contains two hundred different types of trees and shrubs, including an oak tree planted by President Antanas Smetona. The palace, now the Palanga Amber Museum, has an extensive collection of amber jewelry and other artifacts. Symphonic concerts as well as other musical festivals and events take place in the summer, usually in the evening.\n\nPalanga is a resort town through which the Šventoji and Rąžė (Samogitian: \"Ronžē\") Rivers flow into the Baltic Sea. Rąžė was formerly known as Alanga and gave Palanga its name: \"Palanga\" which literally means \"on the Alanga River\". The Palanga municipality extends 24 kilometers from Nemirseta in the south to the Latvian border in the north. Palanga is subdivided to Nemirseta, Vanagupė, Kunigiškiai, Manciškiai, and Šventoji – five neighboring fishermen villages which were united into one city following administrative changes to the area. During the time when the Klaipėda Region was part of Germany, Nemirseta was the northernmost village of East Prussia; conversely Palanga was a border checkpoint between Russian Lithuania and Germany.\n\nThe municipality is accessed by roads from Klaipėda and Šiauliai. There are no railroads in the municipality (the closest rail connection is in Kretinga, the capital of the Kretinga district municipality). Palanga's International Airport, the third largest in Lithuania, offers connecting flights to Scandinavia, Germany, United Kingdom, Poland and to the biggest city in Baltic States - Riga, Latvia. The airport is located between Palanga and Šventoji, and it handles more flights in the summer due to the resort nature of the municipality.\n\nIn the summer, a multitude of tourists stay on Palanga, both for its beaches and to enjoy the maritime atmosphere. There is a carnival centered on Jonas Basanavičius Street, which is a pedestrian-only thoroughfare during the high season. There are dozens of restaurants, bars, rides, and other forms of entertainment. The aforementioned Amber Museum is open to the public, as are as the museum's extensive botanical gardens. Anaičiai Ethnographic Cemetery holds a collection of 19th- and early 20th-century graves. In the Sculptures Garden, one can find 28 contemporary Art statues by artists from Armenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Ukraine.\n\nAlso found in Palanga is one of the oldest operating pharmacies in Lithuania. It was established in the mid-19th century.\n\nThe city is also home to a regional radio station, FM Palanga.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The rebels also claimed to be acting over other causes including bad governance, and religion in the name of the Scottish Reformation. As the government and rebel forces moved back and forth across Scotland without fighting, the conflict became known as the \"chase about raid.\" Queen Mary's forces were superior and the rebel lords fled to England where Queen Elizabeth censured the leader.\n\nThere were fears that her marriage to Darnley signaled a return to Roman Catholicism. Moray is reported to have declared that he aimed at nothing else than \"the maintenance of the true religion.\"\n\nThe rebels gathered in Ayrshire. Mary set out from Holyroodhouse to Linlithgow and Stirling on 26 August 1565 to move to Glasgow and confront them. Her cannon followed, brought by John Chisholm, who had obtained funds from the Burgh of Edinburgh after Mary promised the town rights over Leith. The treasurer of the Scottish exchequer, John Wishart of Pitarro, had sided with the rebellion and was replaced by William Murray of Tullibardine. The Provost of Edinburgh was also removed and Simon Preston of Craigmillar, a friend of Mary put in his place. William Murray's lands were raided by Highlanders. On 31 August, Moray and his supporters arrived in Edinburgh with 1,000 or 1,200 men. The English diplomat Thomas Randolph doubted that this force could withstand the Queen and King's army, as they lacked \"harquebusiers,\" soldiers with hand-guns. Edinburgh Castle was held for the Queen and began to shoot its cannon at the rebels in the town.\n\nThe rebel lords left Edinburgh. Mary came back to Edinburgh in early September and retired to Stirling, then back to Glasgow. Moray's supporters retreated to Dumfries. On 10 September they sent Robert Melville to ask Elizabeth I of England for guns, money, troops, support from Lord Scrope at Carlisle, and naval assistance in the Forth. Thomas Randolph heard that Mary carried a pistol near Hamilton, and Darnley wore a \"gylte corslet\", while the rest of the army wore \"jacks.\" By the 7 September Mary was back at Stirling. Moray and his followers contemplated making for Carlisle in England.\n\nThe English ship, \"The Aide\" captained by Anthony Jenkinson arrived in the Forth on 25 September, but was bombarded by the cannon on Inchkeith and returned to Berwick-upon-Tweed. Jenkynson intended to prevent Lord Seton bringing more munitions for Mary from France. Moray failed to gather significant support and the rebellion was easily crushed by Mary, forcing Moray to flee.\n\nThe rebels crossed the border at Carlisle, then made their way to Newcastle upon Tyne. Moray decided to go to London, and got as far as Royston in Hertfordshire, until he received a letter from Elizabeth I of England to stop as he was not invited and a rebel against his own queen. He was then brought to Westminster on 23 October 1565 to explain himself to Elizabeth and the French ambassadors.\n\nElizabeth said to him that \"itt were no Prince's part to think well of your doinges, ... and, she wolde putt allso her helping hande too make them to understand the dutye which the subject owght to bear towarddes the Prynce.\" Moray declared he had not intended anything to the danger of Mary's person.\n\nMoray stayed in England at Newcastle over the winter and returned to Scotland on 10 March 1566. Mary had summoned him for trial, and David Rizzio had just been murdered. Moray was reconciled with Mary and back on the Scottish Privy Council by 29 April 1566.\n\nThe rebels justified their cause by listing their complaints against Mary and her rule, which were sent to England in the hope of gaining recognition and support.

The protagonist is said to have been born on 20 February 1852 in Vienna and passed on 17 December 1904 at a sanatorium.\n\nThe plot device employed in \"Josephine Mutzenbacher\" is that of first-person narrative, structured in the format of a memoir. The story is told from the point of view of an accomplished aging 50-year-old Viennese courtesan who is looking back upon the sexual escapades she enjoyed during her unbridled youth in Vienna. Contrary to the title, almost the entirety of the book takes place when Josephine is between the ages of 5–13 years old, before she actually becomes a licensed prostitute in the brothels of Vienna. The book begins when she is five years old and ends when she is thirteen years old and starts her career as an unlicenced prostitute with a friend, to support her unemployed father.\n\nAlthough the German-language text makes use of witty nicknames – for instance, the curate’s genital is called \"a hammer of mercy\" – for human anatomy and sexual behavior, its content is entirely pornographic. The actual progression of events amounts to little more than a graphic, unapologetic description of the reckless sexuality exhibited by the heroine, all before reaching her 14th year. The style bears more than a passing resemblance to the Marquis de Sade's \"The 120 Days of Sodom\" in its unabashed \"laundry list\" cataloging of all manner of taboo sexual antics from children’s sexual play, incest and rape to child prostitution, group sex, sado-masochism, lesbianism, and fellatio. In some constellations, Josefine appears as the active seducer, and sex is usually depicted as an uncomplicated, satisfactory experience.\n\nThe original Austrian publication was unillustrated, but a later pirated edition from 1922 contained black-and-white drawings, entirely pornographic as the text. These illustrations were bound in the archival copy of the first edition at the Austrian National Library, and have been reproduced at least in the hardcover edition of the 2018 English translation and in a 2019 Finnish translation, erroneously dated to 1906. Another illustrated German-language edition was published in the late 1960s in Liechtenstein with images by Jean Veenenbos (1932–2005).\n\nOther illustrations have been created as well. The first English translation of 1931 was quickly pirated in New York and illustrated by Mahlon Blaine (1894–1969). The 1973 translation, \"Oh! Oh! Josephine\", is illustrated with photographic stills from \"the continental movie\" of 1970, \"Josephine Mutzenbacher\" a.k.a. \"Naughty Knickers\" by Kurt Nachmann.\n\nAlso a Danish translation of 1967 contains illustrations. An incomplete Swedish translation from 1983 contains random photographs of prostitutes with scathing comments.\n\nThe novel \"Josefine Mutzenbacher\" has given rise to a multitude of interpretations. It has been listed both as child pornography and labeled as an apposite depiction of the milieu and manners of its time in Vienna, a travesty or a parody or a persiflage of a coming-of-age story or a novel of development, and mentioned as a rare case of a picaresque novel with a female protagonist. It has also been praised for its criticism of the bourgeois society.\n\nThe relation of the novel to the Freudian theory of sexuality has been subject to debate. The Swedish translator C.-M. Edenborg sees \"Josefine Mutzenbacher\" as an indictment of Freud’s bourgeois psychology, whereas the Austrian psychoanalyst Désirée Prosquill thinks that not only are there marked thematic correspondences between \"Josefine Mutzenbacher\" (1906) and \"Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality\" (1905) but \"Mutzenbacher\" also anticipates some issues concerning infantile sexuality that Freud added to his theory only later.\n\nThe distribution of the novel \"Josefine Mutzenbacher\" was forbidden in Austria from 1913 on when it was taken into the list \"Catalogus Librorum in Austria Prohibitorum\" because of its obscenity.\n\nIn 1931, a bookseller called Josef Kunz was convicted in Vienna for a public act of obscenity because he had published a new edition of the novel, and the copies of the book were confiscated. In 1971, however, the Supreme Court of Austria decided that there is no longer reason to punish a publisher for distributing the novel because there are artistic tendencies in the work. Still in 1988, there was another legal process to ban the novel because of obscenity, but this time, too, the Supreme Court judged in favour of the publisher.\n\nThe Mutzenbacher Decision (Case BVerfGE 83,130) was a ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany (\"Bundesverfassungsgericht\") on 27 November 1990 concerning whether or not the novel \"Josefine Mutzenbacher\" should be placed on a list of youth-restricted media. However, the significance of the case came to eclipse \"Josefine Mutzenbacher\" as an individual work, because it set a precedent as to which has a larger weight in German Law: Freedom of Expression or The Protection of Youth.\n\n\"Pornography and Art are not Mutually Exclusive.\"\n\nIn Germany, there is a process known as indexing (). The \"Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien\" (BPjM or \"Federal inspection department for youth-endangering media\") collates books, movies, video games and music that could be harmful to young people because they contain violence, pornography, Nazism, hate speech and similar dangerous content. The items are placed on the \"List of youth-endangering media\" (\"Liste jugendgefährdender Medien\").\n\nAn item will stay on the list for 25 years, after which time the effects of the indexing will cease automatically.\n\nItems that are indexed (placed on the list) cannot be bought by anyone under 18, they are not allowed to be sold at regular bookstores or retailers that young people have access to, nor are they allowed to be advertised in any manner. An item that is placed on the list becomes very difficult for adults to access as a result of these restrictions.\n\nThe issue underlying the Mutzenbacher Decision is not whether the book is legal for adults to buy, own, read, and sell – that is not disputed. The case concerns whether the intrinsic merit of the book as a work of art supersedes the potential harm its controversial contents could have on the impressionable minds of minors and whether or not it should be \"indexed\".\n\nIn the 1960s, two separate publishing houses made new editions of the original 1906 \"Josefine Mutzenbacher\". In 1965 Dehli Publishers of Copenhagen, Denmark, published a two volume edition, and in 1969 the German publisher Rogner & Bernhard in Munich printed another edition with a glossary by Oswald Wiener. The BPjM placed \"Josefine Mutzenbacher\" on its list, after two criminal courts declared the pornographic content of the book obscene.\n\nThe BPjM maintained that the book was pornographic and dangerous to minors because it contained explicit descriptions of sexual promiscuity, child prostitution, and incest as its exclusive subject matter, and promoted these activities as positive, insignificant, and even humorous behaviors in a manner devoid of any artistic value. The BPjM stated that the contents of the book justified it being placed on the \"list of youth-endangering media\" so that its availability to minors would be restricted.\n\nIn 1978 a third publishing house attempted to issue a new edition of \"Josefine Mutzenbacher\" that included a foreword and omitted the \"glossary of Viennese vulgarisms\" from the 1969 version. The BPjM again placed \"Josefine Mutzenbacher\" on its \"list of youth-endangering media,\" and the Rowohlt Publishing house filed an appeal with the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany on the grounds that \"Josefine Mutzenbacher\" was a work of art that minors should not be restricted from reading.\n\nOn 27 November 1990 the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany made what is now known as \"The Mutzenbacher Decision\". The Court prefaced their verdict by referring to two other seminal freedom of expression cases from previous German Case Law, the and the \"\" Decision. The court ruled that under the German constitution (\"Grundgesetz\") chapter about Freedom of Art (\"Kunstfreiheit\"), the novel \"Josefine Mutzenbacher\" was both pornography and art, and that the former is not necessary and sufficient to deny the latter.\n\nIn plain English, even though the contents of \"Josefine Mutzenbacher\" are pornographic, they are still considered art and in the process of indexing the book, the aspect of freedom of art has to be considered. The court's ruling forced the BPjM to temporarily remove the Rowohlt edition of \"Josefine Mutzenbacher\" from its list of youth-endangering media.\n\nThe book was added to the list again in November 1992 in a new decision by the BPjM which considered the aspect of freedom of art, but deemed the aspect of protecting children to be more important. Some later editions of the book by other publishers were added to the list as well.\n\nAgain, the publisher appealed to the Administrative Court (\"Verwaltungsgericht\") of Cologne and won the case in 1995. However, the BPjM appealed for its part and won in September 1997 at the higher instance, \"Oberverwaltungsgericht\", and the Federal Administrative Court (\"Bundesverwaltungsgericht\") refused further appeal in February 1998.\n\nTherefore \"Josefine Mutzenbacher\" was taken into the list for 25 years. After this period of time had passed and the indexing ceased, the BPjM decided in November 2017 that there was no more any reason to list the book anew. According to the BPjM, one reason was that, because of the archaic language and parodic style of depiction, the book was no longer considered to conduce its readers to imitate the abusive sexual practices described within. The BPjM also noted that according to current scholarly opinion, the book shows remarkable literary merit, for instance, by tending to present new perspectives to autobiographical works of literature.\n\n\nIn 1976 the heirs of Felix Salten – more precisely, his granddaughter Lea Wyler – demanded the German publishing company Rogner & Bernhard to stop distributing the novel \"Josefine Mutzenbacher\" and to pay royalties. In response, the company asked for \"decisive evidence\" for Salten’s authorship. The heirs could not provide such evidence.\n\nTen years later, In June 1986, the heirs instituted an action at the Munich Landgericht court against Rogner & Bernhard, claiming that Salten’s authorship can be prooved, although they only could provide circumstantial evidence. The court, however, did not examine the question of authorship because, according to the old German Copyright Act, the anonymously published novel had become Public Domain in 1957 and the copyright could no longer be reinstituted; that is, Salten’s heirs should have declared the authorship before the end of 1956. So, the case was ruled in favour of the publishing company in May 1988.\n\nThe heirs appealed to Munich Oberlandesgericht court but lost there in July 1989 and, subsequently, also lost at the Federal Court of Justice in early 1990.\n\nTwo novels, also written anonymously, which present a continuation of the original \"Josephine Mutzenbacher\", have been published. However, they are not generally ascribed to Felix Salten.\n\nAlso the sequels have been translated into many languages. For instance, \"Oh! Oh! Josephine: Volume 2\" from 1973 is an English rendering of \"Meine 365 Liebhaber\".\n\nIn 2000 the Austrian writer Franzobel published the novel \"\"Scala Santa oder Josefine Wurznbachers Höhepunkt\"\" (\"Scala Santa or Josefine Wurznbacher's Climax\"). The title's similarity to Josephine Mutzenbacher, being only two letters different, is a play on words that is not just coincidence. The book's content is derivative as well, telling the story of the character \"Pepi Wurznbacher\" and her first sexual experience at age six.\n\nThe name \"Pepi Wurznbacher\" is directly taken from the pages of \"Josephine Mutzenbacher\"; \"Pepi\" was Josephine Mutzenbacher's nickname in the early chapters. Franzobel has commented that he wanted his novel to be a retelling of the Josephine Mutzenbacher story set in modern day. He simply took the characters, plot elements and setting from \"Josephine Mutzenbacher\" and reworked them into a thoroughly modernized version that occurs in the 1990s. He was inspired to write the novel after being astounded at both the prevalence of child abuse stories in the German Press and having read \"Josephine Mutzenbacher\"'s blatantly unapologetic depiction of the same.\n\n\"Josephine Mutzenbacher\" has been included in several university courses and symposium.\n\nThe Viennese a cappella quartet 4she regularly performs a cabaret musical theatre production based on \"Josephine Mutzenbacher\" called \"The 7 Songs of Josefine Mutzenbacher\" (\"Die 7 Lieder der Josefine Mutzenbacher\"). The show is a raunchy, humorous parody of the novel, set in a brothel, that runs approximately 75 minutes.\n\nIn 2002 the German actor and the jazz group CB-funk performed a live rendition of the texts of Josephine Mutzenbacher and Shakespeare set to modern music composed by Bernd Weißig and arranged by the Pianist Detlef Bielke of the at the in Berlin.\n\nIn January 2005, Austrian actress gave several comedy cabaret live performances of the text of Josephine Mutzenbacher at the Auersperg15-Theater in Vienna, Austria.\n\nIn an event organized by the Jazzclub Regensburg, Werner Steinmassl held a live musical reading of Josephine Mutzenbacher, accompanied by Andreas Rüsing, at the Leeren Beutel Concert Hall in Ratisbon, Bavaria, Germany called \"Werner Steinmassl reads Josefine Mutzenbacher\" on 3 September 2005.\n\nBoth the original Josephine Mutzenbacher and the two \"sequels\" are available as spoken word audio CDs read by Austrian actress Ulrike Beimpold:\n\nIn 1997 Helmut Qualtinger released \"Fifi Mutzenbacher\", a parody on audio CD:\n\nThe Jewish Museum of Vienna displayed an exhibit at the Palais Eskeles called \"Felix Salten: From Josephine Mutzenbacher to Bambi\" where the life and work of Felix Salten was on display, which ran from December 2006 to March 2007. Austrian State Parliament Delegate Elisabeth Vitouch appeared for the opening of the exhibit at Jewish Museum Vienna and declared: \"Everyone knows Bambi and Josefine Mutzenbacher even today, but the author Felix Salten is today to a large extent forgotten\".\n\nThere are several English translations of \"Josefine Mutzenbacher\", some of which, however, are pirated editions of each other. Until 2018, all the English translations were missing the original publisher's introduction.\n\nWhen checked against the German text, the translations differ, and the original chapter and paragraph division is usually not followed, except for the 2018 edition. The original novel is divided only in two long chapters, but most translated editions disrupt the text, each in their own way, into 20–30 chapters, sometimes with added chapter titles.\n\nThe 1973 edition, \"Oh! Oh! Josephine\", claims to be \"uncensored and uncut\", but actually it is incomplete and censored, e.g., obfuscating references to anal intercourse. All these issues are replicated in the 1975 Finnish translation which is made via this English edition.\n\nThe first anonymous English translation from 1931 is abridged and leaves part of the sentences untranslated; the 1967 translation by Rudolf Schleifer, however, contains large inauthentic expansions, as shown in the following comparison:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2073885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073885", "title": "Vladimir Kumarin", "text": "Vladimir Kumarin\n\nVladimir Kumarin, aka Vladimir Barsukov, aka \"Kum\" is a Russian businessman, former deputy president of the Petersburg Fuel Company (PTK) between 1998 and 1999, and the boss of the criminal Tambovskaya Bratva (Tambov gang) of Saint Petersburg.\n\nKumarin was born in Tambov, after compulsory military service he came to Leningrad to study. In the 1980s he served his first sentence for possession of arms and forged documents. Thereafter he met a compatriot from Tambov, Valery Ledovskikh with whom he founded a gang. The gang initially invited only persons from Tambov region (thus its name - Tambovskaya). Being not yet strong enough to operate independently the gang merged into the large criminal group Velikolukskaya (from Velikie Luki, Pskov region) and was engaged mostly in commercial racket.\n\nIn 1989 multiple Kumarin's gang members were convicted for the bloody firefight with another criminal gang, Malyshevskaya. The verdict was rather mild, supposedly because the state prosecutor was severely injured by the unknown persons during the investigation. After having completed a short sentence, Kumarin's gang has swiftly taken over racket all across the North-Western region of Russia - Leningrad, Pskov, Novgorod, Karelia - challenging the business affairs of his former 'host gang'. A bloody skirmish with Velikolukskaya gang caused Kumarin to fall into a month-long coma. His right arm had to be amputated at the shoulder and bullets pierced his stomach, chest and lungs. To this day he still has bullet fragments in his heart.\n\nDuring mid-1990-ties Kumarin attempted to legalize the criminal earnings of his gang using the extensive contacts with the government of St. Petersburg city headed by mayor Anatoly Sobchak (1991-1996), to whom the current Russian President Vladimir Putin served as assistant. Kumarin was an investor to the Kirishinefteorgsintez (Киришинефтеоргсинтез) oil refinery and member of the Board of Petersburg Fuel Company (PTK) controlled by Kumarin. PTK became the sole supplier of gasoline to the municipal transport of St. Petersburg.\n\nSince late 1990-ties few senior members of Kumarin's structures as well as of its adversaries were killed and a row of investigations of his past criminal affairs was published. In June 2003, the magazine \"Der Spiegel\" mentioned that, according to the German ministry of criminal affairs, the German firm St. Petersburg Real Estate Holding Company () (SPAG) had fallen under suspicion of being involved in a money laundering scheme through the Cali cocaine cartel with connections to Kumarin. Russian co-owner of the SPAG's joint venture was the government of Saint-Petersburg and Vladimir Putin, then the municipal official, was a member of the board from 1992 to 2000. In April 2004 German police interrogated Kumarin but no indictments were made. It has been suggested that Kumarin maintained good relations to Russian politicians Mikhail Glushenko and Alexander Filatov. Allegedly after refusing to back down from a business deal in favour of a politician close to Vladimir Putin, Kumarin was raided and arrested by 300 special forces officers on August 24, 2007. Prosecutor General Yury Chaika accused him of banditry and organizing a gang. He was also accused of the murder attempt on businessman Sergei Vasiliev, a rival in the oil business. In 2006, two men with automatic rifles sprayed Vasiliev's car with gunfire, wounding him and killing one of his bodyguards.\n\nKumarin sought to clean up his image via donations to charities and the Russian Orthodox Church of which he was a devout follower as well as securing the release of two kidnapped children of Sergey Borodulin, Russian businessman. During this period his celebrity grew as well, dozens of celebrities and politicians attended his 50th birthday party in 2006. Kumarin was interviewed by Andrey Konstantinov, author of book \"Bandit Petersburg.\" Since 2004 Kumarin-Barsukov served as assistant to the St.Petersburg municipal MP, Alexander Nevzorov, well-known Russian journalist, who endorsed Kumarin as the \"perfectly clean person\" and invited Kumarin to play the role of King Louis XIV in his film. During the 1990-ties, however, Nevzorov covered multiple raids of Kumarin's gang in prime-time TV shows making the gang notorious among the public.\n\nAfter the 2007-2009 investigation Kumarin was sentenced to 14 years in prison plus a fine for the episodes of racket, fraud, money laundering and a murder attempt. The verdict was challenged in the European Court of Human Rights and by 2011 his sentence was reduced by 2.5 years. In 2012 another long investigation of Kumarin's affairs starts. Kumarin was accused of contracting a killing of Galina Starovoitova. Main witness against Kumarin was Mikhail Glushenko a.k.a. Misha-Khokhol, who in turn was in 2015 sentenced for 17 years in prison for arranging of the murder of Starovoitova.\n\nIn March 2019, he was sentenced by the Court of St. Petersburg to 24 years in prison for creating The Tambov Gang.\n\n"}

It was the plantation house of four generations of the Lee family of Virginia (with descendants later to expand to Maryland and other states). Stratford Hall is the boyhood home of two signers of the Declaration of Independence, Richard Henry Lee (1732-1794), and Francis Lightfoot Lee (1734-1797). Stratford Hall is also the birthplace of Robert Edward Lee (1807–1870), a longtime military officer\nin the Corps of Engineers in the United States Army. Later, CSA President Jefferson Davis selected Robert E. Lee as General-in-Chief of the Confederate States Army. Lee commanded the CSA’s Army of Northern Virginia during the American Civil War (1861-1865). After the Civil War, Robert E. Lee became president of Washington College, later known as Washington and Lee University, in Lexington, Virginia. The Stratford Hall estate was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960, under the care of the National Park Service in the U.S. Department of the Interior.\n\nColonel Thomas Lee (1690-1750) was a Virginian who served as acting Governor of the colony and was a strong advocate for westward expansion. Lee purchased the land for Stratford Hall in 1717, aware of its agricultural and commercial potential as a waterfront site. Construction of the Georgian Great House did not begin until the late 1730s. Designed by an unknown architect, the brick Great House is a two-story H-shaped structure, surrounded on four corners by attending outbuildings, all of which still stand today. Following construction of the Great House, Thomas Lee expanded the site into a bustling hive of activity, and soon the working plantation became \"a towne in itself\" as one visitor to Stratford marveled. A wharf on the Potomac River was the destination for a large number of merchant ships, a grist mill ground wheat and corn there, and slaves and indentured servants farmed tobacco and other crops on the thousands of acres of farmland. Blacksmiths, coopers, carpenters, tailors, gardeners, and weavers plied their trades at Thomas Lee's Stratford. Stratford Hall is set in the Historic Northern Neck of Virginia, a rural peninsula where historic Christ Church is located.\n\nIn the midst of this busy world, Thomas Lee and his wife Hannah Harrison Ludwell (1701–49) raised eight children, six sons and two daughters. They played important roles in shaping the early history of the nation. His eldest son, Philip Ludwell Lee Sr., Esquire (1727–75) inherited Stratford Hall. Richard Henry Lee (1732–94) and Francis Lightfoot Lee (1734–97) were delegates from Virginia to the Second Continental Congress, and signers of the Declaration of Independence. Richard Henry was later instrumental in guiding the fledgling nation, serving as President of Congress in 1784-85. Thomas Ludwell Lee, active in local politics, served as a Virginian legislator and helped compose the Virginia Declaration of Rights. William Lee (1739–95) and Dr. Arthur Lee (1740–92) were diplomats to England during the turbulent struggle for American independence. Hannah Lee was an early proponent of women's rights, and Alice Lee married the prominent physician William Shippen Jr. (1736-1808) of Philadelphia.\n\nPhilip Ludwell Lee Sr. (1727–75), a member of the House of Burgesses and the King's Council, continued to expand the plantation after he inherited Stratford until it eventually encompassed almost . A lover of horses and music, Philip and his wife Elizabeth Steptoe (1743–89) had two daughters, the oldest of them known as the \"divine Matilda\". Philip died in 1775, and Elizabeth remarried in 1780 to Philip Richard Fendall I (1734-1805). The new couple continued to reside at Stratford Hall with her two daughters and her son-in-law (and later a hero of the Revolutionary War, Henry \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee (1756-1818), who had married her daughter Matilda. An arrangement was reached in 1784-85 that the Fendalls would turn over their rights to Stratford Hall, and Henry would sell a one-half acre lot situated on Oronoco Street in Alexandria, Virginia for 300 pounds. It was there that Philip R. Fendall built the \"Lee-Fendall House\". Matilda inherited Stratford Hall in this agreement and lived there with her husband Harry and her second cousin, but the couple's time together was cut short when Matilda died after eight years of marriage.\nSeveral years passed before \"Light Horse Harry\" remarried to Ann Hill Carter (1773-1827) of Shirley Plantation. Their fourth child, Robert Edward Lee (1807–70), was born at Stratford Hall in 1807. Robert E. Lee spent only his first four years at Stratford Hall, yet remembered it fondly for the remainder of his life. In the middle of the Civil War, Lee wrote his wife that \"In the absence of a home I wish I could purchase Stratford. That is the only place I could go to, now accessible to us, that would inspire me with feelings of pleasure and local love. You and the girls could remain there in quiet. It is a poor place, but we could make enough cornbread and bacon for our support and the girls could weave us clothes. I wonder if it is for sale and at how much.\"\n\nLight Horse Harry fell heavily into debt and eventually served a two-year term in debtors prison. Anne Carter Lee and the children departed from Stratford Hall during the winter of 1810-11, and moved to Alexandria. Stratford Hall passed into the hands of Harry and Matilda's surviving son Major Henry Lee IV \"Black Horse\" (1787-1837), but financial troubles and personal scandal forced him to sell the plantation several years later.\n\nStratford Hall remained in private hands for more than a century. William C. Somerville of Maryland purchased the property from Henry Lee IV in 1822. After his death his heirs discovered that obligations incurred by Henry Lee IV continued to encumber the property. The plantation was foreclosed in 1828 and purchased by Henry D. Storke of Westmoreland County, who was married to Elizabeth \"Besty\" McCarty, sister of Henry Lee IV's wife, Anne Robinson McCarty. Besty Storke lived on the property until her death in 1879 and was buried there.\n\nIn 1929, a group of women dedicated to preserving the memory of Robert E. Lee and the Lee family joined together to form the Robert E. Lee Memorial Association and purchased Stratford Hall from the Storkes' heirs. Today the site is maintained by the Robert E. Lee Memorial Association and is open to the public.\nStratford Hall was depicted on a 4¢ United States postage stamp of the 1936-37 Army-Navy issue. The stamp shows General Robert E. Lee and \"Stonewall\" Jackson, with Stratford Hall in the center.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2073892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073892", "title": "The Phantom Freighter", "text": "The Phantom Freighter\n\nThe Phantom Freighter is Volume 26 in the original The Hardy Boys Mystery Stories published by Grosset & Dunlap.\n\nThis book was written for the Stratemeyer Syndicate by Amy McFarlane, the wife of long time Hardy Boys author Leslie McFarlane, in 1947. Between 1959 and 1973 the first 38 volumes of this series were systematically revised as part of a project directed by Harriet Adams, Edward Stratemeyer's daughter. The original version of this book was shortened in 1970 by Priscilla Baker-Carr resulting in two similar stories sharing the same title.\n\nThe Hardy brothers embark on a freighter trip under mysterious circumstances and find themselves involved with a smuggling ring. The Hardy Boys discover that the Phantom Freighter is really a smuggling ship used to smuggle counterfeit documents, illegal drugs, cowhides, and electric motors.\n\nEnigmatic stranger Thaddeus McClintock arrives in Bayport and engages Frank and Joe Hardy to arrange for a relaxing trip for him (with the Boys to accompany him) with the mysterious promise of “I’ll pay all expenses and when the trip is over you’ll be paid. Money, if you like. Or something else.” Meanwhile, Aunt Gertrude has arrived and announced that she is going to be living in the Hardy household long term. The shipping company incorrectly delivers one of her cartons, delivering instead a box apparently of raw wool addressed to a Mr. Johnson to the Hardy’s address. After expressing her anger at the shipping company as the carton contains valuable family papers, Aunt Gertrude sends the boys to the address marked on the box to swap the packages. Arriving at the remote farm, the boys find nobody home but the barn ablaze. Frank breaks into the barn to rescue a carton believed to be Aunt Gertrude’s, only to find out it contained discarded newspapers. The owner of the barn arrives and is shocked to find that someone had been staying at his house and having packages delivered while he was out of town. After getting a description of the man who signed for the package from the delivery driver, the boys spot a man matching that description at a clothing store and follow him to the docks where he disappears.\n\nLater, after reviewing several other modes of travel with Mr. McClintock, the boys suggest a cruise on an oceangoing freighter, to which Mr. McClintock is receptive. The boys then try repeatedly to book passage on freighters scheduled through Bayport, but are rebuffed at every turn. The travel agency they attempted to work through, owned by Mr. Klack, seems more interested in keeping them off ships than arranging their passage. Even when the boys are successful at obtaining tickets through an out-of-town travel agency, an unknown individual posing to act on their behalf picks up their tickets, again preventing them from setting sail. At the suggestion of loyal Hardy friend Chet Morton (who is trying his hand at fly-tying), the boys and Mr. McClintock employ local fishing captain Harkness to take them on a fishing expedition. Captain Harkness agrees to take the trip, provided they avoid Barmet Shoals as he recently spotted a phantom freighter there that left him spooked and shaken. After landing a monstrous tuna to the delight of Mr. McClintock and heading back to Bayport, their boat runs out of gas to the disbelief of Captain Harkness. As night falls, the party on the boat is horrified to see a freighter cutting through the sea toward them, only to go silent and dark. Though the boys try hard to locate the ship, it is neither heard or sighted again and has disappeared by first light. Rescue comes from a coastal patrol aircraft and ship the next day.\n\nMeanwhile, numerous other break-ins are discovered in and around Bayport during which nothing was stolen from unoccupied houses, but packages are delivered and signed for by people unknown to the owners. Fenton Hardy reveals that he is working on a case of forged historical documents which have been appearing in the rare document trade.\n\nAunt Gertrude takes a trip to Bridgewater, evasively answering questions about where and why she is going. The boys follow her to Bridgewater and find her meeting with an elderly woman the boys previously identified as one of the people involved in the package delivery scheme. The boys summon the local police who arrest the woman (who is selling some of the contents of Aunt Gertrude’s carton back to her) and search her motel room, finding more stolen property.\n\nThe boys recruit their friend Biff Hooper to help them book passage, which turns to their advantage as an out-of-town travel agent arranges their cruise aboard the \"Father Neptune\". Meeting Captain Gramwell of the \"Father Neptune\", the boys learn that one crew member recently left the ship ill and a new hand had been hired. Suspicious, the boys investigate and find the crewman had in fact been kidnapped and the new hand was sent to interrupt the trip. Captain Gramwell reacts quickly and has the new crewman, recognized by the boys as part of the smuggling ring, arrested and questioned to find his missing crewman, who is recovered.\n\nMr. McClintock, the boys, Biff, and Chet board the \"Father Neptune\" in Southport. At sea, the cargo aboard the \"Father Neptune\" suddenly shifts, leaving the ship listing badly and in danger of sinking. The crew and passengers rush to redistribute the cargo, eventually restoring the ship upright.\n\nThe boys tell Captain Gramwell about the smuggling ring and phantom ship. Captain Gramwell has the ship’s radio operator contact all the ships in the area and discovers that the \"Lion Tamer\" spotted just such a ship nearby. Spotting the ship at nightfall, the \"Father Neptune\" pursues the mystery ship, identified as the \"Black Gull\", but is unable to overtake it, much to the frustration of Captain Gramwell as the \"Father Neptune\" is declared to be the fastest ship in those waters and the mystery ship is obviously older and slower. That night, the mystery ship is again sighted, dark and apparently adrift. Along with the \"Father Nepture\"'s radio operator Sparks, the boys row over to the ship while the \"Father Neptune\" keeps a spotlight on the mystery ship to hide the rowboat. This scene is depicted on the cover of the book. Upon boarding the mystery ship, the party finds the ship seemingly abandoned, but are suddenly jumped by the ship’s crew and captured.\n\nHeld captive with Sparks aboard the \"Black Gull\" by the chief smuggler Crowfoot, the boys pretend to cast in with the smuggler. Crowfeet tells the boys about the ship’s secret repeller belts around the hull which hold off any motorized vessel or aircraft, allowing the \"Black Gull\" (under many different names) to escape from much faster ships and explaining how the boys adrift in the fishing boat were able to get so close with the fishing boat's engine shut down due to fuel exhaustion. After the \"Black Gull\"'s radio operator falls ill, Crowfeet presses a seemingly reluctant Sparks into service to send messages. The boys then take turns sending coded messages via innocent-sounding nursery rhymes to their father, including the line “sailing, sailing, over the bounding main, for many a sailing ship can go faster…”. Soon a sleek racing sloop under full sail (immune to the effects of the repeller which only affects motor vessels) approaches and quickly overtakes the slow freighter. Coast Guard officers board and rescue the boys, Sparks, and the captured scientists who had been kidnapped and forced to work for the smuggler. Among them is a chemist who had developed the techniques used to artificially age paper to supply forged documents for sale in the antique / rare document market. The elderly “smuggler” Mitchell turns out to be Mr. McClintock's former business partner and is happily reunited with Mr. McClintock aboard the \"Father Neptune\". With Mitchell rescued, the entire design for the repeller belt is recovered and Mr. McClintock and Mitchell agree to turn the design over to the US Government. The boys, Chet, Biff, and Mr. McClintock then continue their cruise to the Caribbean. The reader is left with a note that the Hardy Boys next mystery will be \"The Secret of Skull Mountain\".\n"}

It is located about 2 km south of the Middle Kingdom tombs at Beni Hasan, and about 28 km south of Al Minya. Today, the site is a small village known as Istabl Antar.\n\nThere are two temples here, both of which are dedicated to Pakhet. They are cut out of the rock into the cliffs on the eastern side of the Nile. One of the temples, built by the pharaoh Hatshepsut, has an architrave bearing a long dedicatory text with her famous denunciation of the Hyksos. Nearby is a small shrine bearing the name of Alexander IV of Macedon.\n\nAn earlier temple was probably located here, but no traces older than that of Hatshepsut have been found. The decorations inside have been usurped by Seti I in places, his name replacing that of Hatshepsut.\n\nCut from the living rock, Hatshepsut's temple is composed of two chambers connected by a short passageway. The outer portico is rectangular and originally had eight stone columns arranged in two rows Unfortunately, only three of the four columns forming the facade are still relatively intact and none of the internal pillars remain. The rock face above the external pillars of the portico is dressed and inscribed with text bearing Hatshesput's name. It includes the famous text in which she denounces the Hyksos and records her actions in rebuilding the damage they had caused thus legitimising her own reign. Within the portico only the southern wall bears any inscription. The text originally referred to Hatshepsut but was usurped by Seti I who also added further dedications. The smaller inner sanctuary is square with a statue niche at the back. It was not inscribed by Hatshepsut and Brand has suggested that it was in fact Seti who first excavated the passageway and sanctuary.\n\nSeti altered the text to replace Hatshepsut's name with his own and changed representations of the Queen to depictions of himself, but Fairman and Grdseloff argued that there was no clear evidence that Tuthmosis III defaced the chapel when he was expunging her name from other monuments late in his reign despite the existence of his name on some of the pillars of the portico. This conclusion is queried by Brand who suggests that an image of the queen had been vandalised by Tuthmosis and later recarved to depict Seti. Likewise Fairman and Grdseloff did not find evidence that Akhenaten had defaced the name of Amun but Brand concluded that Seti had repaired this damage and notes at least one instance where an earlier version of one of the arms of Amun was still visible. Brand notes that Seti also replaced an image of a priest with that of the god Thoth and concludes that this was the result of the increasing influence of this god's temple in Hermopolis during the reign of Seti. Finally Brand notes that Seti added three scenes to the depictions of the coronation of Hatshepsut but (contrary to Fairman and Grdseloff) found no evidence that he had usurped these scenes from Hatshepsut.\n\n"}

{"id": "2073923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2073923", "title": "Southway", "text": "Southway\n\nSouthway is a large suburban housing estate in north-west Plymouth in the English county of Devon. The name is believed to have derived from the route into Plymouth often used by Buckland Abbey monks, which was known as the \"South Way\".\n\nThe neighbourhood is spread across an often steep topography, which provides good views to the open areas of woodland to the north and south. Southway lies to the north of the Southway Valley Local Nature Reserve, an area of woodland and grassland with extensive footpaths accessible from the housing estate.\n\nPart of the city's extensive post-war housing programme, the land upon which Southway is built was previously occupied by three farms, Southway, Langley and Birdcage, as well as parts of four other farms, Clittaford, Heathfield, Hendwell and Wyvell (now Widewell). Some of these are commemorated in street names, and much of the original woodland and greenery remains in large pockets around the estate.\n\n\nThe 1960s phase also saw a large shopping centre added to the estate, complete with banks and a Public library , as well as two pubs The Falstaff , The Merry Monk (The Abbots Way (The Old Southway)) and The Clittaford Club a Private members club. There are also Anglican and Roman Catholic churches and a community centre .\n\nNearby is the Southway Industrial Estate, which provides a home to large companies such as BAE Systems and Invensys .\n\n2009 - Southway Primary School changes its name to Beechwood Primary School, following its incorporation into the Southernway Federation along with Langley Primary School (now Oakwood Primary School).\n\n2010 - Beechwood Primary School is relocated to a new building on the site of the former Southway Community College in Rockfield Avenue.\n\nThere are 2855 households in Southway, with an average household size of 2.4. The majority (roughly 66%) of houses in Southway are terraced, with comparatively fewer detached or semi-detached properties. Flats comprise approximately 12% of dwellings. There is a lower than average rate of owner occupancy (54% compared with 68.9% nationally).\n\nAlthough there is a uniform post-war typology across the neighbourhood, the houses are constructed with a range of materials, mainly stucco and brick. The residential density is fairly low, at 27 dwellings per hectare.\n\nA new residential development, of 490 dwellings, is currently being constructed in the north-east of Southway. Other potential residential developments have also been proposed in Southway, including on the sites of two former primary schools.\n\nSome of the street names in Southway are named after families who had historically owned land in the Tamerton Foliot area - these include Bonville Road and Bampfylde Way. Other themes for street names include Victorian Plymouthians (such as Burnard Close, after Robert Burnard), Mayors of Plymouth (such as Alger Walk, after William Henry Alger), and British islands and headlands (such as Lundy Close or Flamborough Road).\n\nSouthway is within the Southway Ward of Plymouth City Council. It is part of the Plymouth, Moor View parliamentary constituency, having previously been part of the now-defunct constituency of Plymouth Devonport.\n\nSouthway has a lack of facilities for a neighbourhood of its size. The neighbourhood's one local centre is located on Flamborough Road. Other local facilities, such as primary schools, are located apart from this centre.\nIn 2017, supermarket Aldi opened a store on Flamborough Road. \nThere are two primary schools in Southway, which together comprise the Southernway Federation, with a single executive head and federation governing body. Oakwood Primary School opened in September 2009, after a refurbishment of the site occupied by Langley Infants and Junior Schools. Beechwood Primary is an amalgamation of the former Southway and Tamerton Vale primaries. It opened in September 2008 on the site of the former Southway Primary School, before moving to a new location, on the site of the former Southway Community College, in June 2010. Tamerton Vale Primary had previously been situated on the western edge of the neighbourhood.\n\nSouthway Community College, which closed in July 2002 due to a lack of pupils, had been founded by Peter Bindschedler in 1962 as Southway Comprehensive School. Its name later changed to Southway School before becoming Southway Community College in 1994.\n\nThere is a public library in Southway shopping centre, which is open six days a week with a range of information services.\n\nSouthway Surgery, located on Rockfield Avenue, has three GPs and offers a range of National Health Service (NHS) services including a diabetes clinic and a mother and baby clinic.\n\nHoly Spirit, Southway is a Church of England church within the Diocese of Exeter, located on Clittaford Road. The church building was built in 1960, largely funded by the trustees of the recently closed Kelly College Mission and constructed according to a design of local architect Mr D. McDonald. The building was later extended in 1985, and now has a capacity of 250 people. Formerly part of the parish of Tamerton Foliot, it became a parish church in its own right in 1971.\n\nNearby is the Roman Catholic church of St Thomas More, which was built between 1963 and 1964. Originally a separate parish, it joined with the Crownhill church of St Peter at the beginning of 2006.\n\nPlymouth Miniature Steam is a club for model railway engineers, based at Goodwin Park. The club has been running since the 1960s, and based in Southway since 1990. The miniature railway is open to the public on the first and third Sundays of each month.\n\nSouthway is well-served with bus routes. The whole neighbourhood is within a 5-minute walk of a bus stop, and there are frequent services to Plymouth City Centre and Derriford Hospital.\n\nThere are no designated cycle routes through the neighbourhood, largely because of the difficulties presented by the steep topography.\n\nThe population of Southway has a higher proportion of over-60s than the city of Plymouth as a whole. Life expectancy is higher in Southway than for Plymouth as a whole, although 24.2% of residents have had a long term illness and only 61.2% of people consider their health as 'good'.\n\nThere are limited employment opportunities for Southway residents within the neighbourhood, with 2008 figures showing a job ratio of 0.55 per person.\n\nPolice statistics show that the level of crime and anti-social behaviour in Southway is average, with a rate of 11.18 per 1000 people in April 2011. However, in 2010 there was a 29.3% increase in crime compared with 2009, with particular rises in the rate of domestic burglaries (from 6 incidents to 27) and criminal damage (from 80 incidents to 102). According to surveys conducted by PACT and Plymouth City Council, the rate of anti-social behaviour in the community, and the visible lack of police patrolling, is a source of concern to many Southway residents. In 2008, it was ranked the 28th worst neighbourhood in Plymouth in terms of crime.\n\n"}

At the time, the commander of the Eastern District Army was Lieutenant General Shizuichi Tanaka.\n\nSupport of the Eastern District Army was essential to Hatanaka's plan to take over the Imperial Palace, and so Hatanaka exhorted General Tanaka to aid him. Tanaka refused, and later told his men to ignore Strategic Order 584, forged by Hatanaka and ordering the Eastern District Army to seize and defend the Imperial Palace; in short, to aid in the coup. Rather than send in his men to defeat the rebels by force, Tanaka traveled to the Imperial Palace and spoke to Hatanaka and the other rebel leaders personally, haranguing them, and putting an end to the rebellion.\n\nThe Eastern District Army remained active for several months after the surrender of Japan to help maintain public order until the arrival of the American occupation forces, and to oversee the final demobilization and dissolution of the Imperial Japanese Army.\n\n\n"}

P. Putnam's Sons in 1982 and today is part of Penguin Random House through its subsidiary Penguin Group.\n\nToday, through the Penguin Group, they publish approximately 170 titles a year, including licensed children's books for such properties as Miss Spider, Strawberry Shortcake, Super WHY!, Charlie and Lola, Nova the Robot, Weebles, Bratz, Sonic X, The Wiggles, and Atomic Betty. Grosset & Dunlap also publishes \"Dick and Jane\" children's books and, through Platt & Munk, \"The Little Engine That Could.\"\n\nThe company was founded in 1898 by Alexander Grosset and George T. Dunlap. It was originally primarily a hardcover reprint house. In 1907, Grosset & Dunlap acquired Chatterton & Peck, who had a large children's list including the Stratemeyer Syndicate.\n\nGrosset & Dunlap is historically known for its photoplay editions and juvenile series books such as the Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, The Bobbsey Twins, Tom Swift, Cherry Ames and other books from their long partnership with the Stratemeyer Syndicate (currently owned by Simon & Schuster). \n\nAfter George T. Dunlap retired in 1944, Grosset & Dunlap was sold to a consortium of Random House; Little, Brown; Harper and Brothers; Scribners; and the Book-of-the-Month Club. In 1954, Grosset & Dunlap acquired McLoughlin Brothers. Grosset & Dunlap had an initial public offering in 1961, by which time the majority of the books published were children's books. Grosset & Dunlap launched the paperback reprint house Bantam Books in 1945 in cooperation with Curtis Publishing Company. In 1964, Grosset & Dunlap acquired full ownership of Bantam from Curtis.\n\nGrosset & Dunlap obtained permission from Little, Brown, to reprint Thornton Burgess's many children's books, and began issuing the Bedtime Stories series (20 books originally published 1913–1919, including such titles as \"The Adventures of Reddy Fox\" and \"The Adventures of Chatterer the Red Squirrel\") in 1949. The original Little, Brown editions had plates of high quality paper for the illustrations, but the Grosset & Dunlap editions were to print the illustrations on the same stock as the text. They commissioned the original artist, Harrison Cady, to recreate the illustrations as line drawings appropriate for that type of paper, and to create many additional illustrations. Where the original Little, Brown editions had six full-page illustrations, the Grosset & Dunlap had 14 (fourteen) full-page drawings, plus many smaller drawings placed throughout the text. Cady had matured as an artist in the decades since the original Little, Brown illustrations. The line drawings he did for Grosset & Dunlap are simpler than the illustrations he had made for Little, Brown, and are generally more charming. The original Little, Brown illustrations better convey Cady's remarkable vision for Burgess' creatures.\n\nGrosset & Dunlap published the Burgess books as hardcovers with dustjackets from 1949 to 1957, then as pink hardcovers without dust jackets from about 1962 into the 1970s. They issued them with library bindings in 1977. In most cases, the latest date printed anywhere in the book was from the early 1940s, so the Grosset & Dunlap editions are today often mistaken for being older than they are. In the 1980s, Little, Brown, owned by Penguin, canceled their permission for Grosset & Dunlap to publish the Burgess books. For most of the titles, the Harrison Cady illustrations commissioned by Grosset & Dunlap have never been published since then. An exception is the 2000 Dover edition of \"The Adventures of Paddy the Beaver\", which has all of them (the illustrations in most of the Dover editions are not the Grosset & Dunlap commissions).\n\nIn 1968, Grosset & Dunlap was acquired by conglomerate National General, run by Gene Klein. National General was acquired by American Financial Group in 1973.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the company's Charter Books (also known as Ace Charter) imprint published mystery fiction, most notably the Leslie Charteris series, \"The Saint\".\n\nIn 1974, Filmways bought the company from American Financial Group (Bantam was sold separately). During this time, Grosset & Dunlap acquired a new paperback publisher, Ace Books. Filmways sold Grosset & Dunlap to G. P. Putnam's Sons when Orion Pictures acquired Filmways in 1982.\n\nIn 1978, the company drew a great deal of attention with its publication of \"RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon\". The preparation of the book was alluded to briefly in the 2008 Oscar-nominated film \"Frost/Nixon\", which chronicled and dramatized a series of interviews with the ex-president conducted by British television personality David Frost. Shortly after the aforementioned interviews aired among great publicity, the copy editor whom Grosset & Dunlap sent to San Clemente to work on the book with Nixon's staff was named David Frost.\n\nGrosset & Dunlap also published a series of literary classics which they called the Illustrated Junior Library. This series, published with colorful illustrations, included such titles as \"Heidi\", an expurgated edition of \"Gulliver's Travels\", \"Swiss Family Robinson\", \"The Boy's King Arthur\" (published under the title \"King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table\"), and \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" (a 1956 reprinting of the 1944 edition with new illustrations by Evelyn Copelman, and published under the title \"The Wizard of Oz\"). This edition is still in print and may be a collectors item.\n\nPutnam merged with Penguin Group in 1996 In 2013, Penguin merged with Bertelsmann's Random House, forming Penguin Random House.\n\nToday, Grosset & Dunlap's new juvenile series include Dish, Camp Confidential, Flirt (books), Katie Kazoo, Dragon Slayers' Academy, and Henry Winkler and Lin Oliver's Hank Zipzer series.\n\n\n"}

If holmgang was refused by the accused, he could be outlawed (full outlawry), as this refusal proved that the accuser was right and the accused was '. If the accused fought successfully in \"holmgang\" and had thus proven that he was not ', the \"scolding\" was considered what was in Old English called \", an unjustified, severe defamation, and the accuser had to pay the offended party full compensation.

Unlike a transient voltage suppression diodes, such as Transil, a Trisil acts as a crowbar device, switching ON when the voltage on it exceeds its breakover voltage.\n\nA Trisil is bidirectional, behaving the same way in both directions. It is principally a voltage-controlled triac without gate. The behavior of a Trisil is similar to a SIDAC, but unlike SIDAC, Trisil devices are commonly used to protect circuits from overvoltage. They act faster and can handle more current. In 1982, the only manufacturer was Thomson SA; a successor company, ST Microelectronics continues to make the devices.\n\nThis type of crowbar protector is widely used for protecting telecom equipment from lightning-induced transients and induced currents from power lines. Other manufacturers of this type of device include Bourns (TISP) and Littelfuse (SIDACtor). Rather than using the natural breakdown voltage of the device, an extra region is fabricated within the device to form a Zener diode. This allows a much tighter control of the breakdown voltage.\n\nIt is also possible to make gated versions of this type of protector. In this case, the gate is connected to the telecom circuit power supply (via a diode or transistor) so that the device will crowbar if the transient exceeds the power supply voltage. The main advantage of this configuration is that the protection voltage tracks the power supply, thus eliminating the problem of selecting a particular breakdown voltage for the protection circuit.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2074045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074045", "title": "Svengoolie", "text": "Svengoolie\n\nSvengoolie is an American hosted horror movie television program. The show's title is taken from the name of the character host. The show is a long-running local program in the Chicago area and in recent years expanded nationally, airing Saturday nights on MeTV. He talks about the Scariest Beasts on our planet past and present.\n\nThe show airs both low-budget and classic horror and science-fiction movies, with host \"Svengoolie\" – a telescoping of the words Svengali and ghoul – played by Rich Koz (pronounced \"Koze\"), who wears thick skull-like makeup around his eyes and cheekbones, a moustache, goatee, and long wig, all black, and a black top hat with a tuxedo jacket over a bright red, open-collared, button-down shirt.\n\nJust before and after commercial breaks, Svengoolie presents sketches, tells corny jokes, and performs song parody spoofs of the film being aired. Some shows were presented in what was later dubbed \"Sven-surround\" – a pun on \"Sensurround\", a brand name theater audio system – in which Svengoolie would joke as the film aired sometimes with humorous sound effects. (The creators of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" cited Svensurround as an inspiration.) This stunt was discontinued for a short time, then brought back due to viewer request, although as a clip segment aired outside the film.\n\nOne relatively recent addition to the show is the simultaneous use of Twitter with the hashtag #svengoolie, allowing those watching to comment on the show.\n\nIn August 2006, it was announced that WCIU had obtained broadcast rights to the classic Universal Monsters films of the 1930s and 1940s. These films had been requested since Svengoolie aired in the 1980s. By December 2006, the show featured four episodes of the Abbott and Costello \"Meet\" series, with Universal Studio Monsters and several Hammer Film Productions that were distributed by Universal-International. On May 5, 2007, Svengoolie presented Bela Lugosi's \"Dracula\" (1931), claiming it was the first time the movie had been shown on local television in more than a decade.\n\nThe show opens with a reference to early radio broadcasting: \"Calling all stations, clear the air lanes, clear all air lanes for the big broadcast.\" This is a sound clip from the preview \"trailer\" of one of the four \"Big Broadcast Of ... (1932, 1936, 1937, 1938)\" movies. In a running gag throughout the series, Svengoolie's mentions of the Chicago suburb of Berwyn are met with an audio clip of several people groaning \"BERWYN?!?\" Another recurring gag involves rubber chickens thrown at Svengoolie after a weak joke, usually at the end of an episode's opening and closing sketches. Visitors assist the crew in throwing rubber chickens during taping. Frequently sound clips are used from Warner Bros. cartoons (\"Oh we're the boys of the Chorus,\"...etc.), radio broadcasts of \"The Stan Freberg Show\" (\"Thank you for all those cards and letters, you folks in television LAND...\", \"Wun'erful, Wun'erful\" and \"Ow, OW, OW!!!\" from \"The HoneyEarthers\"), and other sources.\n\n\nMany other incidental characters throughout the show's run have been voiced by Rich Koz and—during his tenure—Jerry G. Bishop, as well as WFLD staff announcer Jim Barton (during the \"Son of\" years).\n\nRich Koz did most of the artwork for the show when he revived it as \"Son of Svengoolie\" at WFLD. For every episode, Koz researches the film to find interesting facts, then writes each episode, spending about four hours doing so.\n\nThe camera shots and audio effects are handled by director Chris Faulkner and Kevin Reisberg, the show's assistant director.\n\nIn 2014, the original casket prop used by both Bishop and Koz on camera was retired and donated to the Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago. Segments showcasing the original casket continued to be rebroadcast on the MeTV schedule. Rebroadcasts often will use improved prints of the films if they have become available, while keeping the old comedy skits.\n\nThe show's original title was \"Screaming Yellow Theater with host Svengoolie\". The title was derived from Screaming Yellow Zonkers, a yellow, sugary glazed popcorn snack, first produced in the 1960s. It wasn't until the revival that the show was titled after the host's name. It debuted on September 18, 1970 on WFLD (Channel 32) and ran until late summer 1973. Svengoolie was played then by Jerry G. Bishop. In later seasons, Rich Koz – a fan who sent in sketch ideas – became a show writer. In 1973, Kaiser Broadcasting took over WFLD from Field Communications and \"Screaming Yellow Theater\" was cancelled and replaced with \"The Ghoul\" from Cleveland. \"The Ghoul\" lasted until 1974 when it was taken off the air. Field Communications took WFLD back from Kaiser Broadcasting in 1978, which led\nJerry Bishop and Rich Koz to discuss the show's resurrection.\n\nOn June 16, 1979, \"Son of Svengoolie\" debuted on WFLD, with Koz in the title role. The show also aired on Field Communications-controlled stations in Philadelphia, Boston, San Francisco, and Detroit. The series ran until WFLD, then owned by Metromedia, was sold to Rupert Murdoch's Fox Television Stations Group in 1986 as part of the newly created Fox network. New management canceled the show, deciding that it did not fit the new programming direction. After 334 shows, the final episode aired January 25, 1986. Koz returned to WFLD in various capacities, mainly as the host of \"Fox Kids Club\" and \"The Koz Zone\" weekday afternoon children's programming, and appearing as an announcer on the Fox network's 1988 New Year's Eve broadcast.\n\nNeal Sabin, the executive vice president of Weigel Broadcasting, brought the show back on December 31, 1994 on WCIU (Channel 26), using \"Svengoolie\" as the name; Koz took the role of Svengoolie when Bishop told Koz that he \"believed he was grown up enough now to no longer be just the Son.\" Koz also hosts a weekly Three Stooges \"Stooge-a-palooza\" show on WCIU.\n\nThe series was aired on Chicago's WWME-CA, Milwaukee stations WBME-CD and WMLW-TV, and occasionally on WMYS-LD in South Bend, Indiana. These stations are owned by Weigel Broadcasting. Beginning on April 2, 2011, Svengoolie's show became available nationally on the MeTV network through the efforts of Neal Sabin.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1986, \"Son of Svengoolie\" won three Chicago Emmys at station WFLD. For its 25th anniversary in 2004, \"Svengoolie\" was presented with the Silver Circle Award by the Chicago/Midwest Chapter of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences for \"outstanding contributions to Chicago television.\"\n\n\"Svengoolie\" is also a consistent winner of the \"Best Horror Host\" award from the Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Awards.\n\nA special four-part crossover story in two-page parts featuring Svengoolie with the various DC Comics superheroes ran through the month of October 2019. DC Comics editor Dan Didio said the idea for this was a \"fun mash-up\" featuring the Justice League alongside elements of the \"Svengoolie\" show.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

Her parents were keen amateur musicians and opera enthusiasts. She was the sister of composer James W. Tate. Her family moved to London in 1898, where Teyte attended St. Joseph's Convent School, Snow Hill, and later studied at the Royal School of Music.\n\nHer father died in 1903 and she went to Paris the following year to become a pupil of the celebrated tenor Jean de Reszke. She made her first public appearance in Paris in 1906 when she sang Cherubino in \"The Marriage of Figaro\" and Zerlina in \"Don Giovanni\", both conducted by Reynaldo Hahn. Her professional debut took place at the Opera House in Monte Carlo on 1 February 1907, where she performed Tyrcis in \"Myriame et Daphné\" (André Bloch's arrangement of Jacques Offenbach's \"Daphnis et Chloé\"), with Paderewski. The following week, again at the Opera House in Monte Carlo, she sang Zerlina.\nFinding that her surname was generally mispronounced in France, she changed it from Tate to Teyte before joining the Opéra-Comique in Paris. After a few small parts, she was cast as Mélisande in \"Pelléas et Mélisande\" by Debussy, replacing the originator of the role, Mary Garden. To prepare for \"Pelléas et Mélisande\", she studied with Debussy himself, and she is the only singer ever to be accompanied by Debussy on the piano with an orchestra in public (see Beau Soir). In 1910, Sir Thomas Beecham cast Teyte as Cherubino and Mélisande and also as Blonde in \"Die Entführung aus dem Serail\" for his London season. Despite her early singing successes, Teyte did not easily establish herself in the main opera houses. Instead, she moved to America and performed with the Chicago Grand Opera Company from 1911–1914 and the Boston Opera Company from 1914–17, singing in Philadelphia and elsewhere, but not in New York, though she created the title role in Henry Kimball Hadley's opera, \"Bianca\", at Manhattan's Park Theater in 1918. Returning to Britain in 1919, she created the rôle of Lady Mary Carlisle in André Messager's operetta, \"Monsieur Beaucaire\", at the Prince's Theatre. She married for a second time in 1921, to Canadian millionaire Walter Sherwin Cottingham, and went into semi-retirement until 1930, when she performed as Mélisande and played the title role in Puccini's \"Madama Butterfly\".\n\nAfter difficulty in reviving her career, she ended up performing music hall and variety (24 performances a week) at the Victoria Palace in London. Finally, in 1936, her recordings of Debussy songs accompanied by Alfred Cortot attracted attention, and recordings remained an important factor in her renewed fame, as she gained a reputation in England and the United States as the leading French art song interpreter of her time. She sang at the Royal Opera House in 1936–37 in \"Hansel and Gretel\", as Eurydice in Gluck's \"Orfeo ed Euridice\" and as Butterfly in \"Madama Butterfly\". In 1938–39 she broadcast performances of Massenet's \"Manon\" in English, with Heddle Nash as des Grieux, in addition to an ill-advised Eva in Wagner's \"Die Meistersinger\". She also appeared in operetta and musical comedy between the wars.\n\nShe made her first New York appearances in 1948, including a Town Hall recital followed by performances of Pelléas at the New York City Center Opera. She continued to record and perform in opera until 1951, making her final appearance in the part of Belinda (to Kirsten Flagstad's Dido) in Purcell's \"Dido and Aeneas\" at the Mermaid Theatre in London. Her final concert appearance was at the Royal Festival Hall on 22 April 1956, aged 68. She spent her last years teaching. She died in London in 1976, aged 88.\n\n\nThe Musicians' Benevolent Fund sponsors a prize in her honour. The Maggie Teyte Prize of £2,000, which is coupled with the Miriam Licette Scholarship of £3,000, is open to women singers under the age of 30. The winner is offered a recital in association with the Friends of Covent Garden for the Royal Opera House.\n\n\n"}

In 1465, he followed the latter's army in France to help King Louis XI of France. He also took part in the Milanese campaigns against Bartolomeo Colleoni and fought alongside Federico III da Montefeltro in the wars in Romagna.\n\nIn 1478 he supported the Florentines against Pope Sixtus IV's expansionism. Two years later he acquired the castle of Mesocco. In 1483, he abandoned Ludovico Sforza and switched his allegiance to Charles VIII of France. In 1484, he defeated the Venetians at Martinengo.\n\nIn 1488, he married Beatrice d'Avalos, after his first wife (Margherita Colleoni) had died. In June of the same year, he moved to southern Italy, entering the service of the Kingdom of Naples and its ruler Ferdinand of Aragon. The same year, Isabella of Aragon, daughter of Prince Alfonso and granddaughter of King Ferdinand married Gian Galeazzo Sforza, formally Duke of Milan. In 1493, the young duke asked his father-in-law for support to regain his ducal power from his uncle, the Regent Ludovico il Moro. Ludovico then asked Charles VIII to invade Naples. Charles swept away any resistance in Italy and soon forced the Neapolitans to sign a treaty of peace. The treaty was negotiated by Trivulzio, who in the meantime had been named commander-in-chief of the Neapolitan army. Impressed by Trivulzio's capabilities, Charles decided to engage him, with Ferdinand's permission, for a salary of 10,000 ducats a year.\n\nTrivulzio marched toward France with Charles' army. When the retreating French were attacked by the League of Venice in the Battle of Fornovo (1495), he fought with the French army. On June 15, 1495, he was appointed governor of Asti and was given noble titles and territories in France. After Charles died in 1498, his successor Louis XII mustered a large army under Trivulzio to conquer the Duchy of Milan from Ludovico. Trivulzio took several fortified towns, and forced Ludovico to abandon Milan. On 6 October 1499, he presented Louis XII with the keys of the city. Louis made him governor of Milan; he had already made him a Marshal of France on September 29.\n\nTrivulzio also took part in the victorious Battle of Agnadello against the Republic of Venice, and commanded contingents of the French army at Novara and (this time allied with the Venetians against the Swiss) Marignano. In 1516 he successfully defended Milan from the assault of Emperor Maximilian I.\n\nHowever, reports about his behavior as governor caused him to fall in disgrace soon afterwards. He went to France to regain his position from King Francis I of France, but in vain. He died at Arpajon (France) in 1518.\n\nHis nephew Teodoro Trivulzio was also a military commander under France, and was briefly governor of Milan, Genoa, and Lyon.\n\nTrivulzio accumulated huge amounts of money, which he used in part as a patron of arts, in particular of works by Bramantino: these include the Trivulzio Chapel in the Basilica of San Nazaro in Brolo, where he was buried, and the tapestries cycle of the Twelve Months now in the Castello Sforzesco in Milan.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci designed a large equestrian statue of Trivulzio, which was never begun.\n"}

Commonly known in Bermuda as the cahow, a name derived from its eerie cries, this nocturnal ground-nesting seabird is the national bird of Bermuda and can be found pictured on Bermudian currency. It is the second rarest seabird on the planet and a symbol of hope for nature conservation. They are known for their medium-sized body and long wings. The Bermuda petrel has a greyish-black crown and collar, dark grey upper-wings and tail, white upper-tail coverts and white under-wings edged with black, and the underparts are completely white.\n\nFor 300 years, it was thought to be extinct. The dramatic rediscovery in 1951 of eighteen nesting pairs made this a \"Lazarus species\", that is, a species found to be alive after having been considered extinct. This has inspired a book and two documentary films. A national programme to preserve the bird and restore the species has helped increase its numbers, but scientists are still working to enlarge its nesting habitat on the restored Nonsuch Island.\n\nCahows typically eat small fish, squid and shrimp-like crustaceans. They also predominantly feed in colder waters. Geolocator studies carried out between 2009 and 2011 confirmed that they primarily forage in two widely separated locations during the non-breeding season (July to October), between Bermuda, Nova Scotia and North Carolina, and to the north and northwest of the Azores archipelago. Special glands in their tube-like nostrils allow them to ingest seawater. These glands filter out the salt and expel it through sneezing.\n\nInitially they were superabundant throughout the archipelago, but because of habitat degradation and invasion of mammals, the bird's suitable nesting areas have dwindled to four islets in Castle Harbor, Bermuda, in the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, some 650 miles east of North Carolina. The cahow is a slow breeder, but excellent flier. It visits land only to nest and spends most its adult life on the open seas ranging from the North Atlantic coastal United States and Canada to waters off western Europe. After 3–4 years at sea, males return to breeding islands to create nests.\n\nBreeding season takes place during January and June. They nest in burrows and only the ones that can be in complete darkness are chosen. Females return after 4–6 years at open sea looking for a mate; the females lay one egg per season. 40% to 50% fail to hatch. Eggs are incubated by both parents and take 53–55 days to hatch. Hatching occurs between May and June. Cahows mate for life and typically return to the same nest each year.\n\nThe Spanish sailors of the 1500s used Bermuda and its surrounding islands as a waypoint for their raids against the Inca and other civilizations. At that time, cahows were abundant and formed dense, noisy colonies. These sailors, as Diego Ramirez writes in 1603, would take up to 400 birds a night for food. In addition to eating birds, conquistadors brought hogs to the island to sustain themselves over their voyage. These hogs decimated the ground-nesting cahow, rooting up their burrows, eating eggs, chicks and adults and disrupting their breeding cycle.\n\nFollowing the Spanish arrival in Bermuda, the English ship \"Sea Venture\" was wrecked on the island in 1609. Those men that were shipwrecked culled the fattest individual petrels and harvested their eggs in abundance, especially in January when other food sources were diminished. This shipwreck led directly to the settlement of the island by the English in 1612.\n\nBermuda's colonization by the English introduced species like rats, cats and dogs, and mass killings of the birds for food by these early colonists devastated their numbers. The remaining cahow population also decreased due to widespread burning of vegetation and deforestation by the settlers during the first 20 years of settlement. Despite being protected by one of the world's earliest conservation decrees, the governor's proclamation \"against the spoyle and havocke of the Cohowes\", the birds were thought to have become extinct by the 1620s.\n\nSubsequent sightings of the cahow were believed to be confusion with the similar Audubon's Shearwater. In 1935, William Beebe of the New York Zoological Society had hopes of rediscovering the bird. By June he was presented with an unidentified seabird that had struck the St. Davids Light house in Bermuda. The bird was then sent to American ornithologist Robert Cushman Murphy of The American Museum of Natural history in New York. He identified the bird as a Bermuda petrel. Six years later, Bermudian naturalist Louis L. Mowbray received a live Bermuda petrel that had collided with a radio antenna tower. The bird was released after rehabilitation two days later.\n\nAfter a bird that died flying into a lighthouse was identified as a cahow, in January 1951 18 surviving nesting pairs were found on rocky islets in Castle Harbour by Murphy and Mowbray and with them was a 15-year-old Bermudian boy, David B. Wingate, who would become the primary conservationist in the fight to save the bird.\n\nDavid B. Wingate devoted his life after that to saving the bird. After university studies and other work, in 1966 Wingate became Bermuda's first conservation officer. He undertook work to address various threats to the Bermuda petrel, including the eradication of introduced rats on the nesting islands and nearby islands, and addressed nest-site competition with the more aggressive, native white-tailed tropicbird \"Phaethon lepturus catsbyii\", which invaded petrel nest burrows and killed up to 75% of all chicks. Following the design and installation of specially sized wooden \"baffler\" burrow entrance covers, which allowed the petrels to enter but excluded the larger tropicbirds, there has been essentially no further chick loss from this cause.\n\nWingate also initiated the ecological restoration of Nonsuch Island, located near the Bermuda Petrel breeding islets. Nonsuch was a near desert after centuries of abuse, neglect and habitat destruction. The measures that had to be taken weren't just for conserving what was left but also to recreate what had been lost, and thousands of endemic and native plant, including Bermuda cedar (\"Juniperus bermudiana\"), Bermuda palmetto palm (\"Sabal bermudana\") and Bermuda olivewood (\"Cassine laneanum\"), were propagated and planted out on Nonsuch to recreate the original forest ecosystem that once covered Bermuda, but which was almost entirely lost through disease and clearing for agriculture, shipbuilding and residential development. In total, almost 10,000 individual native and endemic plants of over 100 species were planted on Nonsuch starting in 1962, and have since developed into a well-established closed-canopy forest, similar to early accounts of what was found on Bermuda by the earliest settlers in the 1600s. Wingate's goal was to restore the habitat on Nonsuch Island so that it could eventually serve as a viable nesting site for the species.\n\nEven after retirement, Wingate designed and donated artificial plastic nest boxes to the Cahow Recovery Project, funded by the Bermuda Audubon Society. These nests were an effort made toward assisting the recovery of the Bermuda Petrel, which normally nest in deep soil burrows or rock crevices but suffered from a shortage of suitable nest sites and soil for the birds to burrow in on the original nesting islets. Artificial concrete burrows have been used for many years to provide additional nesting opportunities for the birds, but are very labor-intensive to construct, requiring 400-800 lbs of concrete each. The new nest boxes were designed to meet the birds nesting needs, and it is hoped that they will assist in the recovery of the Cahow for its future survival.\n\nDavid Wingate retired in 2000, after which Jeremy Madeiros became the Bermuda Government terrestrial conservation officer, taking over the management of the Cahow Recovery Program and the Nonsuch Island Living Museum Project. Madeiros carried out a review of the status of the Bermuda Petrel, identifying erosion of the four small original nesting islets due to hurricane damage and sea-level rise as the single largest threat facing the species. A banding program for both fledgling and adult Petrels was initiated in 2002, and by 2015 had resulted in over 85% of all Bermuda Petrels being fitted with identification bands, enabling positive identification of individual birds through their breeding lifespan. Madeiros published a recovery plan for the Bermuda Petrel, which provided guidelines and objectives for the management of the species, in 2005.\n\nIt was recognized that the four original tiny nesting islets, which were the only nesting locations for the Petrel and which totaled only 1 hectare (2.4 acres) in area, did not provide sufficient habitat for the species to fully recover. Madeiros, assisted by the Australian petrel specialist Nicholas Carlile, proposed and carried out a translocation project to re-establish a nesting population of Bermuda Petrel on Nonsuch Island, which at 6.9 ha (16.5 acres) was much larger and more elevated that the original nesting islets, offering safety from erosion and hurricane flooding and providing room for potentially thousands of nesting pairs. In 2004, the trial year of the project took place with 14 chicks translocated 18–21 days before fledging from the original nesting islets to a group of artificial concrete nest burrows constructed on Nonsuch, where they were fed fresh squid and anchovies and monitored every day until departure, with all fledging successfully. In 2005, 21 chicks were translocated, with all again fledging successfully by mid-June. This project was continued for a total of five years, with 105 chicks in total being translocated, of which 102 fledged successfully out to sea.\n\nThe first translocated Bermuda Petrels returned when mature to Nonsuch Island in February 2008. The first Petrel egg on Nonsuch Island in more than 300 years was laid in January 2009, and the resultant fledgling departed in June of the same year. A total of 49 of the original 102 translocated birds had been confirmed as returning to the nesting islands by 2015, of which 29 had returned to Nonsuch itself. This project has been successful in establishing a new nesting colony on Nonsuch, which by 2016 had grown to 15 nesting pairs. This colony had already produced 46 successfully fledged chicks between 2009 and 2016.\n\nBased on the success of the first translocation project, Madeiros started a second translocation project in 2013 at a different location on Nonsuch, to establish a second colony and foothold for the Bermuda Petrel on that island. During the first three years of this second project, a total of 49 near-fledged Cahow chicks had been translocated to the \"B\" colony site, with 45 successfully fledging out to sea. In 2016, the first of these birds, translocated as a chick in 2013, returned and paired up with a non-translocated bird in a burrow at the original translocation colony on Nonsuch.\n\nA Sound Attraction System was also set up in 2007 to help encourage returning translocated birds to stay and prospect on Nonsuch, and overcome any tendency for young birds to be attracted back to the activity at the original nesting islets.\n\nThanks to the conservation efforts over the past five decades and extensive legal protection, the population of the Bermuda Petrel has risen from 17-18 breeding pairs producing 7-8 fledged chicks in 1960 to 132 breeding pairs producing 72 fledged chicks in 2019. The main threats for the future of the bird is still the lack of a suitable breeding sites, with 80% of the Bermuda Petrels nesting in artificial burrows, and ongoing erosion of the original smaller nesting islets due to hurricane impacts and sea-level rise. Category 3 Hurricane Fabian destroyed about 15 nesting burrows in 2003, and damage to most of the remainder required urgent repair and construction of replacement burrows. In 2010, Hurricane Igor caused further extensive damage to nest burrows on the original islets, and in 2014, Category 2 Hurricane Gonzalo, a late-season hurricane, killed 5 nesting pairs that had already returned on the smaller nesting islets. The global population of this bird in 2015 was about 300 individuals. A cahow was captured in a burrow and ringed on Vila islet, Azores, in November 2002. It was recaptured there in November 2003 and December 2006 . Another individual was seen off the west coast of Ireland in May 2014, the furthest the species has ever been seen from Bermuda.\n\nStarting in 2011 the \"CahowCam\" project was launched by the Bermuda-based LookBermuda / Nonsuch Expeditions Team in partnership with the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources. Since then it has been live streaming infrared video from specially adapted artificial nesting burrows from Nonsuch Island Translocation Colony A using specialized cameras and lights custom built by Team Leader Jean-Pierre Rouja. In 2016 they partnered with The Cornell Lab of Ornithology bird-cam team resulting in over 20 million minutes of CahowCam footage being watched in the following 3 seasons. http://www.nonsuchisland.com/live-cahow-cam\n\nCahows, being a recovering lazarus species, need special attention in order to support recovery and population growth. All nesting and nearby islands are strictly protected as part of the Castle Islands Nature Reserve, and landing by the public is prohibited except by special permission in the company of the conservation officer. This area is also designated as an international I.B.A. (Important Bird Area), in recognition of containing the entire world population of Bermuda Petrel, and up to 20% of the North Atlantic population of white-tailed tropicbird. These islands are maintained rat-free by an annual baiting program, and domestic animals are prohibited from landing on all islands in the reserve. In addition, there is an ongoing management program to eradicate non-native invasive plant species on all of the reserve islands, coupled with plantings of native and endemic plant species, many of which are also endangered. Several of the nesting islands are also the subject of an ecological restoration project, to restore them as examples of the terrestrial plant and animal communities once found on, but now largely lost from, the rest of Bermuda.\n\nThough the Bermuda petrel's population has explicitly increased and it is projected that the population will double every 22 years, there are still clearcut inhibitors on its path to recovery. The petrel's vulnerability has drastically increased due to substantial damage to its habitats and nesting sites by tropical storms and climate change. The predicted future increase of category 4 and 5 tropical storms pose an imminent threat to the petrels' long-term survivability. Tropical storms also aid the long-term effect of erosion of their surrounding habitat which hamper conservation efforts. As a solution, there is research going into finding another suitable area to make the artificial nesting places. Its recovery has been hampered by competition from white-tailed tropicbird (\"Phaethon lepturus)\" for nest-sites and predation of subadults by a single snowy owl (the first ever recorded in Bermuda) on Nonsuch Island, which was eradicated after having eaten 5% of the population. Light pollution from a nearby airport and a NASA tracking station adversely affects nocturnal aerial courtship.\n\nAnother major issue with nests is competition with other birds in the area. To address this problem, artificial dome nests were created for tropicbirds along areas, not used by the Bermuda petrel, and by applying wooden baffles over the entrances of petrel burrows. These baffles only allow petrels to enter, keeping the competition of tropicbirds out. Another factor may be that the cahow will have an increased risk of extinction because of restricted ranges, small population sizes, and lower genetic diversity. Additionally, the characteristic philopatry of petrel species may mean that birds continually return to the same high-mortality breeding sites year after year.\n\nRats also swam to one breeding island in April 2005, but were successfully eradicated within two weeks without loss to the Cahows. Unfortunately this pattern appeared to be repeated in March 2008, with five chicks killed on one of the nesting islets. Immediate baiting produced a dead black rat, \"Rattus rattus\". However, as the islands were all baited at the beginning of the nesting season, this incident pointed out the need for constant vigilance of reintroduction and a requirement to provide fresh bait on the islands throughout the nesting season. This was underlined by further invasions of some of the nesting islands, including Nonsuch Island, in 2014 and 2015, although this time without loss to the birds.\n\n\n"}

Since 2006 the development team consisted only of Donninger and Lutz. Hydra was under the patronage of the PAL Group and Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi. The goal of the Hydra Project was to dominate the computer chess world, and finally have an accepted victory over humans.\n\nHydra represented a potentially significant leap in the strength of computer chess. Design team member Lorenz estimates its FIDE equivalent playing strength to be over Elo 3000, and this is in line with its results against Michael Adams and Shredder 8, the former micro-computer chess champion.\n\nHydra began competing in 2002 and played its last game in June 2006. In June 2009, Christopher Lutz stated that \"unfortunately the Hydra project is discontinued.\" The sponsors decided to end the project.\n\nThe Hydra team originally planned to have Hydra appear in four versions: Orthus, Chimera, Scylla and then the final Hydra version – the strongest of them all. The original version of Hydra evolved from an earlier design called Brutus and works in a similar fashion to Deep Blue, utilising large numbers of purpose-designed chips (in this case implemented as a field-programmable gate array or FPGA). In Hydra, there are multiple computers, each with its own FPGA acting as a chess coprocessor. These co-processors enabled Hydra to search enormous numbers of positions per second, making each processor more than ten times faster than an unaided computer.\n\nHydra ran on a 32-node Intel Xeon with a Xilinx FPGA accelerator card cluster, with a total of 64 gigabytes of RAM. It evaluates about 150,000,000 chess positions per second, roughly the same as the 1997 Deep Blue which defeated Garry Kasparov, but with several times more overall computing power. Whilst FPGAs generally have a lower performance level than ASIC chips, modern-day FPGAs run about as fast as the older ASICs used for Deep Blue. The engine is on average able to evaluate up to a depth of about 18 ply (nine moves by each player), whereas Deep Blue only evaluated to about 12 ply on average. Hydra's search used alpha-beta pruning as well as null-move heuristics.\n\nThe Hydra computer was physically located in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, and was usually operated over a high speed optical fiber based network link.\n\n\n\nHydra was not defeated by an unaided human player in over-the-board play. Hydra has, however, been beaten by humans who had access to other programs during their games; for example, correspondence chess International Grandmaster Arno Nickel beat an older version of Hydra in a two-game correspondence match lasting six months. The 32-node version that played against Adams managed to draw Nickel in their third game, which lasted five months and ended in December 2005.\n\n"}

It is located in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India. The Temple stands on the western bank of the holy river Ganga, and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest of Shiva Temples. The main deity is known by the names Shri Vishwanath and Vishweshwara (IAST: \"Vishveshvara\") literally meaning \"Lord of the Universe\". Varanasi city is also called \"Kashi\" in ancient time, and hence the Temple is popularly called as Kashi Vishwanath Temple. The etymology of the name Vishveshvara is Vishva: Universe, Ishvara: lord, one who has dominion.\n\nThe Temple has been referred to in Hindu scriptures for a very long time as a central part of worship in the Shaiva Philosophy. It has been destroyed and re-constructed a number of times in history. The last structure was demolished by Aurangzeb, the sixth Mughal emperor who constructed the Gyanvapi Mosque on its site. The current structure was built on an adjacent site by the Maratha ruler, Ahilya Bai Holkar of Indore in 1780. Maharaja Ranjit Singh, First Sikh Maharaja, donated 1 ton Gold for flaming Temple's Dome.\n\nSince 1983, the temple has been managed by the government of Uttar Pradesh. During the religious occasion of Shivratri, Kashi Naresh (King of Kashi) is the chief officiating priest.\n\nThe temple is mentioned in the Puranas including the Kashi Khanda (section) of Skanda Purana. The original Vishwanath temple was destroyed by the army of Qutb-al-din Aibak in 1194 CE, when he defeated the Raja of Kannauj as a commander of Mohammad Ghori. The temple was rebuilt by a Gujarati merchant during the reign of Delhi's Sultan Iltutmish (1211–1266 CE). It was demolished again during the rule of either Hussain Shah Sharqi (1447–1458) or Sikandar Lodhi (1489–1517). Raja Man Singh built the temple during Mughal emperor Akbar's rule, but some Hindus boycotted it as he had let the Mughals marry within his family. Raja Todar Mal further re-built the temple with Akbar's funding at its original site in 1585.\n\nIn 1669 CE, Emperor Aurangzeb destroyed the temple and built the Gyanvapi Mosque in its place. The remains of the erstwhile temple can be seen in the foundation, the columns and at the rear part of the mosque.\n\nIn 1742, the Maratha ruler Malhar Rao Holkar made a plan to demolish the mosque and reconstruct Vishweshwar temple at the site. However, his plan did not materialize, partially because of intervention by the Nawab of Awadh, who was given the control of the territory. Around 1750, the Maharaja of Jaipur commissioned a survey of the land around the site, with the objective of purchasing land to rebuild the Kashi Vishwanath temple. However, his plan to rebuild the temple did not materialize either. In 1780, Malhar Rao's daughter-in-law Ahilyabai Holkar constructed the present temple adjacent to the mosque. In 1828, Baiza Bai, widow of the Maratha ruler Daulat Rao Scindhia of Gwalior State, built a low-roofed colonnade with over 40 pillars in the Gyan Vapi precinct. During 1833–1840 CE, the boundary of Gyanvapi Well, the ghats and other nearby temples were constructed. A 7-foot high stone statue of Nandi bull, gifted by the Raja of Nepal lies to the east of the colonnade. Many noble families from various ancestral kingdoms of the Indian subcontinent and their prior establishments make generous contributions for the operations of the temple. In 1841, the Bhosales of Nagpur donated silver to the temple. In 1835, Maharaja Ranjit Singh of the Sikh Empire, donated 1 tonne of gold for plating the temple's dome.\n\nThe temple was managed by a hereditary group of pandas or mahants. After the death of Mahant Devi Dutt, a dispute arose among his successors. In 1900, his brother-in-law Pandit Visheshwar Dayal Tewari filed a lawsuit, which resulted in him being declared the head priest.\n\nAs per the Shiva Purana, once Brahma (the Hindu God of creation) and Vishnu (the Hindu God of Preservation) had an argument about who was supreme. To test them, Shiva pierced the three worlds as a huge endless pillar of light, the \"jyotirlinga\". to determine who was mightier Vishnu took the form of Varaha and sought out the bottom while Brahma took the form of a swan to fly to the pillar's top. Brahma out of arrogance lied that he had found out the end, offering a katuki flower as witness. Vishnu modestly confessed to being unable to find the bottom. Shiva then took the form of the wrathful Bhairava, cut off Brahma's lying fifth head, and cursed Brahma that he would not be worshipped. Vishnu for his honesty would be worshiped as equal to Shiva with his own temples for all eternity. The \"jyotirlinga\" is an ancient axis mundi symbol representing the supreme formless (nirguna) reality at the core of creation, out of which the form (saguna) of Shiva appears. The \"jyothirlinga\" shrines, thus are places where Shiva appeared as a fiery column of light. There are 64 forms of Shiva, not to be confused with Jyotirlingas. Each of the twelve \"jyotirlinga\" sites take the name of the presiding deity - each considered different manifestation of Shiva. At all these sites, the primary image is \"lingam\" representing the beginningless and endless \"Stambha\" pillar, symbolizing the infinite nature of Shiva. The twelve \"jyothirlinga\" are Somnath in Gujarat, Mallikarjuna at Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh, Mahakaleswar at Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, Omkareshwar in Madhya Pradesh, Kedarnath in Himalayas, Bhimashankar in Maharashtra, Viswanath at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, Triambakeshwar in Maharashtra, Vaidyanath Jyotirlinga, Deogarh in Deoghar, Jharkhand, Nageswar at Dwarka in Gujarat, Rameshwar at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu and Grishneshwar at Aurangabad in Maharashtra.\n\nThe Manikarnika Ghat on the banks of Ganges near to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple is considered as a Shakti Peetha, a revered place of worship for the Shaktism sect. The Daksha Yaga, a Shaivite literature is considered as an important literature which is the story about the origin of Shakti Peethas.\n\nPhalgun Shukla Ekadashi is celebrated as Rangabhari Ekadashi i.e. colors. According to tradition, before Holi, Baba Vishwanath comes back to Kashi after having a cow in the form of mother Bhagwati.The temple complex is echoed by the echo of dozens of Damroos. This tradition has been performed for over 200 years.\nOn Basant Panchami Baba's Tilak is performed, Shivaratri marriage and Rangbhari Ekadashi marks parvati leaving with shiva. These traditions are carried out by the erstwhile mahant family of the temple for over a century.\n\nThese rituals of Baba's marriage ceremony are performed at the residence of Dr. Kulpati Tiwari, the erstwhile Mahant of Shri Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Redzone. The seven rituals of Saptarishi Aarti were performed by Baba Vishwanath. According to the Puranas, Kashi is loved by the Saptarishi to the priest, so according to the tradition, the devotees of the Saptarishi Aarti perform the rituals of marriage. The seven archaks under the leadership of Pradhan Archak Pandit Shashibhushan Tripathi (Guddu Maharaj) completed the marriage in Vedic rituals.\n\nThe temple complex consists of a series of smaller shrines, located in a small lane called the Vishwanatha Galli, near the river. The linga of the main deity at the shrine is tall and in circumference housed in a silver altar. The main temple is quadrangle and is surrounded by shrines of other gods. There are small temples for Kaalbhairav, Dhandapani, Avimukteshwara, Vishnu, Vinayaka, Sanishwara, Virupaksha and Virupaksh Gauri in the complex. There is a small well in the temple called the \"Jnana Vapi\" also spelled as \"Gyaan vapi\" (the wisdom well). The Jnana Vapi well sites to the north of the main temple and during the invasion by the Mughals the Jyotirlinga was hidden in the well to protect it at the time of invasion. It is said that the main priest of the temple jumped in the well with the Shiv Ling in order to protect the Jyotirlinga from invaders.\n\nAccording to the structure of the temple, there is a Sabha Griha or Congregation Hall leading to the inner Garbha Griha or Sanctum Sanctorum. The venerable Jyotirlinga is a dark brown colored stone which is enshrined in the Sanctum, placed on a silver platform. Structure of the Mandir is composed of three parts. The first compromises a spire on the Mandir of Lord Vishwanath or Mahadeva. The second is gold dome and the third is the gold spire atop Lord Vishwanath carrying a flag and a trident.\n\nThe Kashi Vishwanath temple receives around 3,000 visitors every day. On certain occasions, the numbers reach 1,000,000 and more. Noteworthy about the temple is 15.5-metre-high gold spire and gold dome. There are three domes each made up of pure gold, supplied by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1835.\n\nLocated on the banks of the holy Ganges, Varanasi is regarded among the holiest of the Hindu cities. The Kashi Vishwanath temple is widely recognized as one of the most important places of worship in the Hindu religion. Inside the Kashi Vishwanath Temple is the Jyotirlinga of Shiva, Vishveshvara or Vishvanath. The Vishveshvara Jyotirlinga has a very special and unique significance in the spiritual history of India.\n\nMany leading saints, including Adi Sankaracharya, Ramakrishna Paramhansa, Swami Vivekananda, Bamakhyapa, Goswami Tulsidas, Swami Dayananda Saraswati, Sathya Sai Baba and Gurunanak have visited the site. A visit to the temple and a bath in the river Ganges is one of many methods believed to lead one on a path to Moksha (liberation). Thus, Hindus from all over the world try to visit the place at least once in their lifetime. There is also a tradition that one should give up at least one desire after a pilgrimage the temple, and the pilgrimage would also include a visit to the temple at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu in Southern India, where people take water samples of the Ganges to perform prayer at the temple and bring back sand from near that temple. Because of the immense popularity and holiness of Kashi Vishwanath temple, hundreds of temples across India have been built in the same architectural style. Many legends record that the true devotee achieves freedom from death and saṃsāra by the worship of Shiva, Shiva's devotees on death being directly taken to his abode on Mount Kailash by his messengers and not to Yama. The superiority of Shiva and his victory over his own nature—Shiva is himself identified with death—is also stated. There is a popular belief that Shiva himself blows the mantra of salvation into the ears of people who die naturally at the Vishwanath temple.\n\n\n\n"}

The film serves as an alternative prequel to \"The Exorcist\" (1973). It is the fifth installment in \"The Exorcist\" series.\n\nThe official prequel to \"The Exorcist\" before being retooled to turn into \"\", as Morgan Creek Productions executives feared the already completed film would be unsuccessful, it received a limited released in the United States on May 20, 2005, by Warner Bros. Pictures, after \"Exorcist: The Beginning\" became a financial and critical disappointment. Although the film received better reviews than \"Exorcist: The Beginning\", it was still met with mostly negative reviews.\n\nIn 1944, a Nazi SS lieutenant named Kessel forces the parish priest of a small village in occupied Holland, Father Lankester Merrin (Stellan Skarsgård), to participate in arbitrary executions in retaliation for the murder of a German trooper in exchange for sparing the village.\n\nIn 1947, Merrin, whose faith was shattered by the incident, is an archaeologist in Derati, a remote area in the Turkana region of British Kenya excavating a Byzantine church built around the 5th century—long before Christianity had reached that region of Africa. He meets up with Father Francis (Gabriel Mann), a Maryknoll missionary appointed to ensure the church is not desecrated, and Major Granville (Julian Wadham), the British military officer overseeing the dig.\n\nMaking their way to Derati with Chuma (Andrew French), Merrin's translator and guide, Merrin introduces Francis to Rachel (Clara Bellar), a doctor who spent time in a concentration camp and is haunted by her experiences there, and Emekwi (Eddie Osei), an enthusiastic convert who provides accommodation for the two men. Merrin takes Francis on a tour of the dig site. Astonishingly, the church is in perfect condition, as though it had been deliberately buried immediately after its construction was completed.\n\nOn the site, Merrin meets a shy, physically-deformed young boy named Cheche (Billy Crawford), shunned and mistreated by the locals for fear that he is cursed. Although dissuaded by Chuma, Merrin attempts to make contact with Cheche, finally managing to bring the boy to Rachel for medical treatment.\n\nOnce the door is uncovered, Merrin, Francis, and Chuma go inside the church. Francis notices that this particular church is built in such a way as to restrain something beneath it. A hidden passageway leads them to a crypt containing a demonic idol—an ancient sanctuary where human sacrifice was performed. Merrin deduces that the church was built, not as a place of worship, but to seal this underground temple. On their way back, they find corpses of hyenas (who have appeared out of season) being eaten by a herd of cattle. The Turkana elders, thinking the church is evil, demand Merrin stop digging.\n\nFrancis contacts Granville to send a detachment to guard the dig from potential robbers, despite Merrin's objections. Two British soldiers attempting to loot some precious stones from the church are then found dead the next day (one was beheaded; the other crucified to the altar head downward). Despite the Christian symbolism used in the murders and the testimony of Jomo (Israel Aduramo), a Turkana warrior who had long been keeping a wary eye on the site, that the two men were affected by a strange madness that caused them to kill each other, Granville, blaming the Turkana, goes to town in a fit of rage demanding the purported culprits be given up, shooting a young woman in cold blood when the locals protest. The town is then placed under military surveillance.\n\nDetermined to stop the 'Christian evil' from spreading, Jomo breaks into the mission school and slaughters Francis' students—Emekwi's two sons—before he is shot on the spot by British soldiers. Emekwi bitterly questions if this is how God rewards those who keep faith with him.\n\nFrancis has a disturbing realization that Cheche's unusual recovery is not caused by God, as he had thought. Fearing for Cheche's soul, he considers baptising him; the boy accepts on the condition it be held at the church. Meanwhile, a guilt-ridden and despairing Granville commits suicide by shooting himself in the mouth.\n\nThe Turkana elders (via Chuma) demand that the church be reburied and Francis—who they hold responsible for the spread of the 'Christian evil' and the arrival of the British troops—and Cheche be handed over to them to be killed; when their demands are turned down, war between the two sides become inevitable.\n\nFrancis, assisted by Rachel, begins to baptise Cheche at the church; as they do so, however, the demon controlling Cheche assaults them. Realising an exorcism is in order, Francis leaves quickly to fetch his copy of the Roman Ritual. The demon removes Cheche's deformities and transforms him into a hairless, androgynous 'perfect' being; an earthquake erupts and seals off the entrance to the church. The Sergeant-Major (Ralph Brown), Granville's second-in-command who had assumed control of the troops after the latter's death, postpones Merrin's requests to clear the entrance for daybreak.\n\nThe next morning, Merrin and the British find Francis tied to a tree naked, shot with arrows, but still alive. Francis is taken to the hospital to be looked after by Emekwi's wife. After recovering, Francis reveals to Merrin that Cheche is possessed and begs him to perform an exorcism. Another earthquake shifts the rocks, unblocking the church entrance just enough to allow Merrin to go inside. At the underground temple, Merrin finds Rachel—who runs away under a trance—and the possessed Cheche. Merrin rushes back to the infirmary to wear Francis' vestments, and goes back to the church to begin the exorcism. The demon offers Merrin a chance to rewrite his past, at which Merrin (in a hallucination) finds himself back in 1944 Holland: when he refuses to cooperate, Kessel instead has Merrin \"and\" all the villagers killed for his defiance.\n\nWhen Merrin comes back to his senses, the demon mocks the futility of his attempt to change what happened. As Merrin recommences the exorcism, a supernatural aurora appears in the sky, the entranced Rachel attempts to kill herself, Emekwi violently beats his wife and the Turkana charge to battle. Despite the evil spirit's resistance, the exorcism succeeds. Cheche regresses to his former condition as the demon leaves his body and enters that of a hyena.\n\nWith the demon driven out of Derati, life returns to normal and the British detachment leave. One of the local elders, however, warns that the demon will pursue Merrin. Bidding farewell to Rachel and Cheche, now serving as Rachel's assistant at the infirmary, Merrin, who has regained his faith and is an active priest once more, leaves for Rome.\n\n\nJohn Frankenheimer was originally hired as director for the project, but withdrew before filming started due to health concerns. He died a month later. Paul Schrader replaced him, agreeing to do the film because he found the script and the studio's approach intriguing. The film, titled \"\", was nearly completed and even had begun to be marketed (a teaser trailer had been released) when it was shelved by Morgan Creek Productions over concerns about the film's commercial viability.\n\nDespite Schrader having faithfully directed the script the studio had developed, Morgan Creek (in Schrader's estimation) had a case of \"buyer's remorse\" upon seeing the result in rough cut form, believing that the film was too cerebral and lacking in overt \"horror\" scenes that would be expected from the franchise. The studio consequently replaced Schrader with Renny Harlin, originally with the plan to conduct a few re-shoots. Ultimately, the movie was re-written and re-shot altogether, albeit with many of the same plot points, locations and sets as the original production, but with a tone dramatically shifted to that of a more conventional horror film. Several cast members were retained for the more expensive second production, as was cinematographer Vittorio Storaro.\n\nAfter poor audience and critical response to Harlin's version, Morgan Creek decided to complete the Paul Schrader version on the potential of recouping what was now a compounded investment. The studio first hired an editor, Tim Silano, to assemble Schrader's version, but Silano insisted that Schrader be brought back to oversee the editing of his own material. Morgan Creek allocated $35,000 and a very short amount of time for Paul Schrader to finish his version.\n\nThe film, like \"Exorcist: The Beginning\", is shot in Univisium (2:1) aspect ratio (developed by Vittorio Storaro, who also acted as the cinematographer), although the video release was presented in 1.78:1.\n\nThe meager outlay provided by the studio to resume the film's final stage of post-production resulted in a number of compromises. Specifically, Schrader was not given enough money to conduct ADR, to bring cinematographer Vittorio Storaro back to perform the film's color timing (forcing him and Silano to approximate it themselves), nor to commission an original score for the entire film. Instead, the score was developed piecemeal, with fourteen minutes (including a central theme) being composed without payment by Angelo Badalamenti. The final twenty minutes of the film were scored by the American metal band Dog Fashion Disco (the unusual choice stemming from Schrader's son's affection for the group), while the balance of the score - about an hour's worth - was recycled from Trevor Rabin’s work for the Harlin version. In addition to contributing compositions, Dog Fashion Disco also \"finessed\" the score as a whole to give it a unity despite its disparate sources.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures released Schrader's version theatrically under the title \"Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist\" (since \"Exorcist: The Beginning\" was used by the Harlin version) as a very limited release (110 screens) in May 2005, followed later that year by a DVD release.\n\nWhile William Peter Blatty, the author and screenwriter of \"The Exorcist\", described \"Dominion\" as \"a handsome, classy, elegant piece of work\", critical reaction to the film has nonetheless been mixed to negative. Many critics stated that it is only slightly better than Harlin's version, holding a rating of 30% on Rotten Tomatoes and a score of 55 out of 100 on Metacritic, whereas \"Exorcist: The Beginning\" holds a rating of 11% on Rotten Tomatoes and a score of 30 out of 100 on Metacritic.\n\nNonetheless, the good reviews \"Dominion\" did get were much more positive than those of Harlin's version. Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave it three stars out of four, and wrote that it \"does something risky and daring in this time of jaded horror movies: it takes evil seriously.\" Leslie Felperin of \"Variety\" magazine wrote that this film is \"intelligent, quietly subversive\" and \"Schrader has delivered a 100% Paul Schrader film, drenched in the spiritual and moral angst that's watermarked his career from \"Taxi Driver\" (as a writer) to \"Auto Focus\" (as a director).\"\n\nOwen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said that \"Schrader's film is a notch better than , but when you boil out the demon feathers, it's the same damn movie.\" Scott Tobias of The Onion's A.V. Club said that \"Skarsgård [gives] a quietly mesmerizing performance\", and that \"Schrader's movie isn't particularly scary, but it's more substantive than \"The Exorcist\" and its sequels, because it takes demon possession out of head-spinning literalism and considers evil as something more real and commonplace.\"\n\nDavid Edelstein of the magazine \"Slate\" said the film is \"a good, thoughtful horror picture, and [very] close to being a very good one.\" Brent Simon of IGN gave the film a score of 4 out of 10, saying: \"The overall feeling \"Dominion\" gives off is one of rootless languor. You keep waiting for someone or something to show up and seize control of the picture, but it never really happens until the final confrontation, which feels like it might as well come from a different movie. It's not blood or gore that's missing, its context; \"Dominion\" is too polite and urbane to frighten.\n\nDirector Erik Kristopher Myers, who was the first to ever review the film in 2005, wrote, \"The curious thing about the Exorcist franchise is that you have three films following the same narrative thread, but none of the chapters feel as though they belong to a greater whole. Each one plays too differently from the previous installment, destroying any sense of genuine continuity beyond names or locations. Schrader’s film is the first to synthesize the elements of each one, whether intentionally or otherwise, and presents us with an \"Exorcist\" that owes as much to Friedkin as it does to Boorman and Blatty. At the same time, it also manages to achieve its own identity while still being directly linked to \"The Exorcist\", \"\" and \"The Exorcist III\". No other film in the series has a genuine marriage to each of its partners the way that Schrader’s does.\"\n\nThe film was released on DVD October 25, 2005 by Warner Home Video and included deleted scenes, photo gallery, and an audio commentary by director Paul Schrader.\n\nOn October 10, 2006, the film was released with \"The Exorcist\", \"The Exorcist: The Version You've Never Seen\", \"\", \"The Exorcist III\" and \"\" in a box set titled \"The Exorcist: The Complete Anthology\".\n\nOn September 23, 2014, the film was released on Blu-ray as part of the Blu-ray version of \"The Exorcist: The Complete Anthology\". Unlike the DVD release, the film is only available in the box set. There are no plans to release the film as a standalone release at this time.\n\n"}

Mantova had played consecutively in the Italian Serie B from the 2005–06 season to 2009–10 as Associazione Calcio Mantova (A.C. Mantova), when they were relegated after ending the season in 20th place.\n\nDuring the summer 2010, the club went bankrupt and was refounded as Mantova F.C., being immediately promoted in the following season from Serie D group B to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione.\nThe club went bankrupt again in 2017 and has since played three consecutive seasons in Serie D.\n\nMantova played in a sky blue shirt with white shorts and sky blue socks until 1956, when OZO company became the club's main sponsor. Colours were changed from sky blue and white to white and red, the colours of the company, in an unusual scheme for Italian football: white with a red sash. Mantova debuted in Serie A with this kit.\n\nIn the late 1960s, when the club had poor results, a red shirt with white shorts and red socks was adopted as the home kit. The OZO Mantova kit was reintroduced by the owner Fabrizio Lori in the 2000s, and since then became the home kit.\n\nIn the last years the away kit has usually retained the home kit scheme, inverting the colours: a white sash on a red base.\n\nSky blue has been used mainly for third kits. During the 2010-11 campaign, a special sky blue shirt with a white and red sash was released to celebrate the club's 100th anniversary and was used as the first choice kit for the final part of the season.\n\nDuring the Serie B years between 2005 and 2008 Mantova used a yellow kit with a green sash to remember the \"\"Piccolo Brasile\"\", the team who achieved three promotions in four years between the end of the 1950s and the start of the 1960s.\nMantova crest has always been characterized by two elements: the town's coat of arms and a light blue semicircle to remember the original colours of the team, combined in a round shape. The round element has been inserted in a red and white shield, with an upper white stripe in which the name of the club is written.\n\nMantova was founded in 1911. They played in Serie A for seven seasons: 1961–62, 1964–65, 1966–67, 1967–68, 1971–72), being nicknamed in its initial period as \"Little Brazil\" (\"\"Piccolo Brasile\"\"). The green and yellow shirt actually remembered that period, by far the best one in the team history. Mantova has also played eight seasons in Serie B, winning the title 1970–71.\n\nMantova was cancelled two times from the Italian football panorama, in 1983 and 1994, both times due to insolvency.\n\nFormer famous players for the club include Dino Zoff, Angelo Sormani, Anton Alleman and Karl-Heinz Schnellinger.\n\nMantova was promoted from Serie C2 to Serie B in two consecutive seasons, in 2003–04 as league champions, and in 2004–05 as runners-up and playoff winners. Mantova begun the 2005–06 Serie B campaign introducing itself as a strong potential candidate for promotion to Serie A, despite its lack of players experienced with these levels (almost the same squad which promoted to Serie B the previous season) and a coach, Domenico Di Carlo, on just his second year as first team football trainer. The team led the Serie B table for a long part of the season, gaining an unexpected interest by the media. However, Mantova was not able to maintain the head of the league in the end, and the team concluded its season in fourth place, gaining a spot in the promotion playoffs. Successively, AC Mantova won its playoff semifinal against Modena after two ties (0–0, 1–1), qualifying because of its top placement in the regular season. The first playoff final, against Torino, saw Mantova winning at home 4–2. However, Mantova was not able to maintain this advantage in the return match, lost 3–1 in Turin after extra time, which allowed Torino to be promoted in Serie A because of a superior placement in the regular season.\n\nDuring the 2006–07 season, Mantova became the first club to beat Juventus in a Serie B match. They ended the season in eighth place, confirming themselves in the top side of the league table. Following Di Carlo's resignations, Mantova appointed Attilio Tesser as new head coach for their 2007–08 Serie B campaign. As part of an ambitious summer transfer market, on 23 August 2007 Mantova signed former Italian international Stefano Fiore. However, the club's campaign proved to be disappointing as the team failed to break into the promotion playoff zone, resulting in the sacking of Tesser in the mid-season. He was replaced by Giuseppe Brucato, a young manager with no previous experience in the league, who guided the club to a mid-table finish in the season.\n\nBrucato was confirmed as head coach of Mantova for the 2008–09 season. As Fiore parted company with the club following an unimpressive season with the \"virgiliani\", he was replaced by Tomas Locatelli. However, Mantova failed to assure themselves a place in the higher ranks of the league, causing the sacking of Brucato following a 1–3 home defeat to Parma. The club successively appointed former Milan defender Alessandro Costacurta as its new head coach. Costacurta later resigned and was replaced by Mario Somma, who led the club to a final 13th place, only two points ahead the relegation play-off zone.\n\nFor the 2009–10 season, Mantova was guided by former Italian international Michele Serena. The financial situation of the club was deteriorated, which the club raised the short term profit by player exchange, but also raised the long term amortisation cost. The club had swapped Stefano Mondini with Christian Jidayi on 30 June 2008 in co-ownership deal for €750,000, made the clubs had player selling revenue of €1.5 million. June 2009 also saw Jidayi return to Cesena and Mondini back to Mantova; 50% of both players' rights were valued at €750,000. However, it became a financial burden for both clubs, which Mantova had to amortise Mondini's value (€1.5 million) in instalments as amortisation. In June 2008 Mantova also swapped Valerio Di Cesare (€1M) and Simone Calori (€0.5M) with Riccardo Fissore (€0.5M) and Mattia Marchesetti (€1M). Again, Mantova had to amortise €0.5M in for 3 seasons for Fissore (€166,667) and Marchesetti (€333,333).\n\nAt the beginning of 2010–11 season, Mantova went bankrupt and a new entity was admitted to Serie D. Mantova came first in Girone B and gained promotion to 2011–12 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione. They finished 16th and only escaped relegation after beating both Lecco and Vibonese in the playoffs. The first leg against Vibonese was a 0–0 stalemate away, leading to fears the club would not survive the second leg. However, Mantova went on to record a famous 4–0 victory. The home leg was viewed by over 3,000 spectators and Mantova enjoyed some of the strongest support of the 40 sides in Lega Pro Seconda Divisione. Throughout the 2011–12 season, Mantova sacked three managers and three sporting directors.\n\nIn the 2012–13 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione, Mantova had a solid season, finishing in ninth place, nine points short of a promotion playoff place and 11 points above a relegation playoff place. In the off season, 70% of Mantova is sold to former Sambonifacese president Michele Lodi, who became the president of Mantova.\n\nThe Lega Pro Seconda Divisione underwent a reformatting. The first eight teams in each girone, plus one team winning the relegation playoff round from each division will remain in Lega Pro. The last six teams in each girone, plus three relegation play-out losers from each division will be relegated to Serie D. In all, eighteen teams will remain in Lega Pro, and eighteen teams will be relegated to Serie D.\n\nIn the 2013–14 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione, Mantova finished eighth, which guaranteed them a spot in next season's 2014–15 Lega Pro Divisione Unica, the new Serie C. The team was part of the \"Group A\".\nMantova remained in the third tier until 2017.\nAt the start of season, the club did not join the 2017–18 Serie C, a successor club, Mantova 1911 S.S.D., was admitted to 2017–18 Serie D instead.. In 2018 it was taken over by Maurizio Setti, the holder of Hellas Verona, who invested in the club to be promoted to Serie C. Mantova lost the championship to Como despite reaching 83 points, and it is now at its third consecutive season in Serie D.\n\n\"As of 2 January 2019.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2074116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074116", "title": "Phan Thiết", "text": "Phan Thiết\n\nPhan Thiết () is the capital of Bình Thuận Province on the southeast coast in Vietnam, where all government offices for the province are located. While most of the inhabitants live in the city center, the others live in the four urban coastal wards, extending from Suối Nước beach in the northeast towards cape Kê Gà in the southwest.\n\nTraditionally, fishing and manufacturing of fish sauce has been the main source of Phan Thiết's income thus far, the picturesque fishing fleet in the harbor providing colorful proof. Drawn by the beautiful beaches of the area, tourism is rapidly replacing the fishing industry as the main employer.\n\nThe first resorts along the beaches of Hưng Long and Phú Thủy wards, as well as Phú Hài and Hàm Tiến wards east of the city center appeared in the mid-nineties. Since then, tourism has boomed and hundreds of hotels, restaurants, resorts, guesthouses and shops have been constructed along the coastline.\n\nRang Beach in Hàm Tiến ward was discovered by foreigners in 1995 while they watched the solar eclipse. Misled by guidebooks, which incorrectly labelled Rang Beach as \"Mũi Né Beach\", they were the first of a long row of tourists mistakenly calling everything east of the Phan Thiết city center \"Mũi Né.\"\n\nEach area of Phan Thiết has its own characteristics. The beaches of Kê Gà and Tiến Thành are peaceful and quiet, inviting tourists to swim and relax. There is not much traffic on the roads along the coastline, so walking or riding along the beach is quite peaceful.\n\nCompared to Nha Trang, the density of resorts along the beaches of the city center in Phan Thiết is quite low, so when tourists leave their hotels, they step into the middle of the bustling daily life of a Vietnamese city. You can walk to many restaurants, museums or shopping malls – even visit the school where Hồ Chí Minh taught before he went to study in Paris.\n\nPhú Hài ward covers a hilly area along the coastline and has many small beaches and hidden coves. Many of the resorts in this ward are built above the water on the hills and have a relatively small beach to themselves. Sea Links City, composed of a hotel, condos, apartments, a winery and a golf course, is located here. Ba Nai Hill in Phú Hài ward is the place of the old Po Sah Inư Cham Tower, built in the 8th century and worth a visit.\n\nAlongside the 10 kilometer strip of what is locally known as Rang Beach, in Hàm Tiến ward, there is a lively tourist strip. Hundreds of resorts, hotels, bars, restaurants, shops, travel agencies and spas are situated here.\n\nIn recent years advanced beach erosion has become a major issue for Phan Thiết's beaches, especially in Phú Hài and Hàm Tiến wards, so some resorts lack a beach at high tide: the water directly reaches the sea wall. In recent years a number of resorts had to install geotechnical tubes (Geotubes) to keep their beaches from further eroding. \n\nOne of the great tourist attractions of Hàm Tiến is the so-called Fairy Stream, where a small creek has carved a canyon through the dunes, revealing colorful layers of sand and limestone.\n\nBeyond Hàm Tiến is Mũi Né, consisting of two communities, adding up to around 25,000 residents in the actual town, and two beaches. The second community is Hon Rom, a fishing village with a few hundred residents. Mũi Né has the highest population outside the city center and is quite lively in the morning. In the evening locals join together for coffee or dinner at the many cafés and restaurants, especially around the local market.\n\nMũi Né actually translates to \"Shelter Cape,\" because for ages the local fishermen used the cape to shelter their boats from the wind. The town itself covers the west side of the cape, whereas many resorts are alongside Ganh Beach and Suối Nước. A resort in Mũi Né ward is the right decision for people who want to be close to a local community, but keep their distance from the bustling tourist strip and rather prefer a quiet beach.\n\nAnother tourist attraction are the orange sand dunes, located on a hill between Mũi Né and Hon Rom. At the entrance of Hon Rom you can explore the \"Red Canyon\", a small cliff which has eroded to create a beautiful ridge, consisting of fragile red sand. The larger white sand dunes (Bàu Trắng) are around 23 kilometers north of the town.\n\nPhan Thiết operators usually make a distinction between the winter and summer seasons. During winter, mostly Northern Europeans and Russians spend their holidays here, far away from the northern chill, to enjoy kitesurfing and windsurfing. In the summer season, Phan Thiết is a popular destination for Australians and North Americans, as well as many Vietnamese escaping the steaming hot cities for a fresh breeze of sea wind.\n\nThere are several theories about the origin of the name Phan Thiết, most of which agree that it is not a pure Vietnamese name:\n\n\nPhan Thiết is subdivided into 18 wards and communes, of which 14 are urban wards, namely: Đức Thắng, Đức Nghĩa, Đức Long, Phú Hài, Phú Thủy, Phú Trinh, Phú Tài, Thanh Hải, Hàm Tiến, Mũi Né, Xuân An, Bình Hưng, Hưng Long and Lạc Đạo, and 4 suburban communes, namely: Tiến Lợi, Tiến Thành, Thiện Nghiệp and Phong Nẫm.\n\nLocated on an arm of the East Vietnam Sea, Phan Thiết is one of Vietnam's most important fishing areas. Its population is roughly 205,333 (as of 2004). Hồ Chí Minh reportedly lived in Phan Thiết for a short time around 1910 and worked as a schoolteacher.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, Phan Thiết was the site of the U.S. military base known as Landing Zone Betty, which was located at the now closed airfield southwest of the city. In recent years, Phan Thiết (specifically Mũi Né Beach) has been transformed into a resort destination. 24 October 1995 is considered to be the birth of tourism in Phan Thiết, when thousands rushed to Mũi Né to see the total solar eclipse. The event was commemorated on the same day in 2005 as the tenth anniversary of tourism for the province. Local people in Phan Thiết regularly practice a ceremony to a whale god, which is believed to give good luck in nautical pursuits.\n"}

The club was renamed as Associazione Sportiva Avellino 1912 in 2010 and restored to the original \"Unione Sportiva Avellino 1912\" in 2015, before assuming the current denomination in 2018.\n\nThe club was founded as \"U.S. Avellino\" during 1912 to give the town of Avellino a footballing representative. The early history of the club is quite obscure as they only competed at a lower level against regional sides. Avellino competed in \"IV Divisione\" from 1913 until after the Second World War; today's equivalent of that level is Serie D.\n\nFor the earlier part of their history the club did not achieve anything of note, until being placed in Serie C for the 1945–46 post-War season. In the 1946–47 season they narrowly missed out on getting through to the interregional final, after finishing third in their group.\n\nAvellino beat out the likes of Catania, Reggina and Messina to win promotion to Serie B at the end of the 1940s. However, the club were accused of match fixing and the federation decided to strip them of their promotion, instead relegating them down to Serie D. Although they were able to return to Serie C after one season, Avellino were relegated back down to spend six seasons in a row at Serie D level.\n\nEventually Avellino returned, but in the space of six seasons, Avellino gained promotion to Serie C in three of them and were relegated back down twice.\n\nAvellino were promoted to Serie B in 1973 and Serie A in 1978. A truly remarkable feat for a southern provincial side was a 10-year stay in Serie A between 1978 and 1988, with the club holding a mid-table place for the majority of that period. Their best finish was 8th in 1987, with a team starring Angelo Alessio, Paolo Benedetti, Franco Colomba and Dirceu. The club has tended to shift between Serie B and C1 in the years since.\n\nMore recently, the club marked a Serie B return after defeating neighbours Napoli in the Serie C1/B play-off finals. An unsuccessful 2005–06 campaign ended in a loss on relegation playoffs to Albinoleffe (0–2, 3–2). The 2006–07 season, with Giuseppe Galderisi as head coach, then replaced by Giovanni Vavassori, ended in a second place in the Serie C1/B regular season; this was then followed by a successful campaign in the promotion play-offs, in which Avellino defeated Foggia in the finals, being therefore promoted to Serie B once again. However, this was followed by Vavassori's resignations on 16 July 2007, shortly after his confirmation as Avellino boss, being then replaced by Maurizio Sarri two days later. Sarri himself resigned one month later, being replaced by Guido Carboni and later Alessandro Calori. Despite this, the club did not manage to escape relegation, ending the season in 19th place. The club was however readmitted to Serie B later on to fill a league vacancy created by Messina's disbandment.\n\nThe team finished second from bottom in the 2008–09 season and was therefore relegated. On 9 July 2009, the Covisoc (\"Commissione di Vigilanza sulle Società Calcistiche\", Vigilancy Commission on Football Clubs) organization announced that the team did not pass the financial requirements in order to be admitted to the league. The club was allowed to appeal the decision until 11 July 2009. On 11 July, Avellino failed to appeal the exclusion.\nA new club founded in the summer 2009 as \"Avellino Calcio.12 S.S.D.\" restarts from Serie D, finishing 5th, but 4 August 2010 they were later admitted to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione to fill vacancies. This ordeal saw them become the latest in a long line of Italian clubs that have faced severe financial difficulties, such as Napoli and Fiorentina.\n\nIn the 2010–11 season the team became Associazione Sportiva Avellino 1912 and played in Lega Pro Seconda Divisione finishing 4th, being defeated by Trapani in the play-off final, but 4 August 2011 it was later admitted to Lega Pro Prima Divisione, again, to fill vacancies. In the season 2012–13 Avellino won Lega Pro Prima Divisione and the team obtains the promotion in Serie B.\n\nIn 2018, Avellino was excluded from Serie B due to submitting a league membership paperwork that was deemed as incomplete, due to a late bank guarantee. Due to this, new club was refounded within days in order to submit application to play at Serie D instead. In 2019 Avellino won Serie D and the Scudetto Serie D, reaching the promotion in Serie C for the next season. \n\nIts traditional colours are green and white.\nAvellino are nicknamed the \"Lupi\", which means wolf, and their club crest displays a wolf head.\n\n\"As of 31 January 2020.\"\n\n10 – Adriano Lombardi, Midfielder (1975–79) – \"posthumous honor, number retired in 2007.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2074120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074120", "title": "Shtriga", "text": "Shtriga\n\nA shtriga is a vampiric witch in Albanian mythology and folklore that sucks the blood of infants at night while they sleep, and then turns into a flying insect (traditionally a moth, fly or bee). Only the shtriga herself could cure those she had drained. The shtriga is often pictured as a woman with a hateful stare (sometimes wearing a cape) and a horribly disfigured face. They usually live in hidden places in the forest and have supernatural powers. The term \"shtriga\" is used also with the common meaning of \"witch\", referring to a bad and ugly old woman who casts evil spells to people. The male noun for \"shtriga\" is \"shtrigu\" or \"shtrigan\".\n\nThe Albanian word \"shtrigë\", definite: \"shtriga\" derives from the Latin \"strīga\", \"evil spirit, witch\", related to , and .\n\nAccording to legend, only the shtriga herself could cure those she had drained (often by spitting in their mouths), and those who were not cured inevitably sickened and died.\n\nThe name can be used to express that a person is evil. According to Northern Albanian folklore, a woman is not born a witch; she becomes one, often because she is childless or made evil by envy. A strong belief in God could make people immune to a witch as He would protect them.\n\nUsually, shtriga were described as old or middle-aged women with grey, pale green, or pale blue eyes (called white eyes or pale eyes) (\"sybardha\") and a crooked nose. Their stare would make people uncomfortable, and people were supposed to avoid looking them directly in the eyes because they have the evil eye (\"syliga\"). To ward off a witch, people could take a pinch of salt in their fingers and touch their (closed) eyes, mouth, heart and the opposite part of the heart and the pit of the stomach and then throw the salt in direct flames saying \"\"syt i dalçin syt i plaçin\"\" or just whisper 3–6 times \"\"syt i dalçin syt i plaçin\"\" or \"\"plast syri keq\".\"\n\nIn some regions of Albania, people have used garlic (\"hudhër\"); to send away the evil eye or they have placed a puppet in a house being built to catch the evil. Newborns, children or beautiful girls have been said to catch the evil eye more easily, so in some Albanian regions when meeting such a person, especially a newborn, for the first time, people might say \"\"masha'alla\"\"h\"\" and touch the child's nose to show their benevolence and so that the evil eye would not catch the child.\n\nEdith Durham recorded several methods traditionally considered effective for defending oneself from shtriga. A cross made of pig bone could be placed at the entrance of a church on Easter Sunday, rendering any shtriga inside unable to leave. They could then be captured and killed at the threshold as they vainly attempted to pass. She further recorded the story that after draining blood from a victim, the shtriga would generally go off into the woods and regurgitate it. If a silver coin were to be soaked in that blood and wrapped in cloth, it would become an amulet offering permanent protection from any shtriga.\n\nIn Catholic legend, it is said that shtriga can be destroyed using holy water with a cross in it, and in Islamic myth it is said that shtriga can be sent away or killed by reciting verses from the Qur'an, specifically Ayatul Kursi 225 sura Al-Baqara, and spitting water on the shtriga.\n\nA shtriga was featured in the \"Supernatural\" episode, \"Something Wicked\" by hiding itself as a male doctor in a children's ward at a hospital where children have suddenly fallen comatose and where it can continue to feed.\n\nA shtriga was featured in the \"Lost Girl\" episode \"Follow the Yellow Trick Road.\" Bo's friends search for the creature after figuring out that the shtriga had bitten Bo in its moth form, leaving her comatose and dying as it feeds on her fears.\n\nGeralt of Rivia fought a shtriga in the novel \"The Last Wish\" by Andrzej Sapkowski, part of \"The Witcher\" series. The scene also takes place in the 2007 video game \"The Witcher\". In the 2019 Netflix series \"The Witcher\", a shtriga is featured in episode 3.\n\nThe Shtriga appears in the \"Legends of Tomorrow\" episode \"Wet Hot American Bummer.\" This version attacks the children at a summer camp and poses as a camp counselor.\n\n\n"}

The party faced a revival in 2009, when it was joined by liberal politician Paweł Piskorski, formerly a member of Civic Platform.\n\nThe Alliance of Democrats has its origins in the Democratic Clubs, which were opposed to authoritarian and nationalistic tendencies in the Second Republic of Poland between the two World Wars (1919–1939). The first club was founded in Warsaw in September 1937, and by 1938 there were clubs in all major urban centres, with active participation of the co-founders of Polish independence, whose primary objective was ensuring a fully democratic political system in Poland. The national founding convention of the Alliance of Democrats was held on 15 April 1939. The Declaration of Policy included such issues as improvement of the national economy, a development plan to raise the level of education, and modernisation of the armed forces. Mieczysław Michałowicz, a member of the Senate, was appointed the first party leader of the Alliance.\n\nDuring World War II, a significant number of Alliance members were involved in the anti-Nazi Polish underground. One of its major leader was active in the Vila Ghetto. It was partly due to their initiative that Żegota, the Council for Aid to Jews, was founded in 1942 as well as the Social Organisation for Self-Defence. The Alliance of Democrats and other political and social organisations set up the Association of Democrats, which then entered the Council of National Unity, the Polish Underground State Parliament. In 1943 SD split into two factions, one of which supported the Polish Government-in-Exile in London, and the second co-operated with the communist Polish Workers' Party and recognized the State Country Council as the actual parliament and the Provisional Government of National Unity as the actual government of Poland. In 1945, following the Red Army seizure of Poland, two members of the Association, Eugeniusz Czarnowski and Stanisław Michałowski, were arrested by the NKVD and tried in the Stalinist-orchestrated Trial of the Sixteen, aimed at eliminating non-communist Polish political leadership.\n\nThe London faction ceased to exist in 1945.\n\nIn the People's Republic of Poland SD became a \"satellite\" party of the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) regime (similar parties existed in East Germany and Czechoslovakia). Even so, the party managed to sustain its non-Marxist orientation.\n\nAt their 12th Convention in 1981, the Alliance put forward proposals to establish a Tribunal of State, a Constitutional Tribunal, an Ombudsman Office, and to restore the Senate. Furthermore, the convention suggested that 3 May, the anniversary of the Constitution of 3 May 1791, should become a national holiday, as it had always been for the Alliance of Democrats. After martial law was declared in Poland in 1981, a group of MPs representing the Alliance, Hanna Suchocka, Dorota Simonides and Jan Janowski among them, voted against abolishing the Solidarity Trade Union. Some Alliance members became engaged in the activities of the anti-Communist underground opposition.\n\nIn 1989 representatives of the Alliance of Democrats participated actively in the Round Table negotiations. Following the elections of 4 June, the Alliance, with the United People's Party and the Solidarity Civic Parliamentary Club, formed a coalition, supporting the government of Tadeusz Mazowiecki as Prime Minister, the first democratic government since 1939. Three Alliance members were nominated to governmental posts: Jan Jankowski as Deputy Prime Minister, Aleksander Mackiewicz as Domestic Market Minister and as Minister of Communications, Marek Kucharski, who is today the Secretary General of the Alliance. At the motion of the parliamentary party of the Alliance, the anniversary of the Constitution of 3 May was proclaimed a national holiday, the state again assumed \"Republic of Poland\" as its name, and an eagle wearing a crown was restored as the national emblem.\n\nAfter 1990, most of the members of the SD joined other parties, such as the Freedom Union. The party continued to exist, but had only a small support base, and was not represented in the Polish parliament.\n\nDue to the financial considerations required under the Polish political system, parties need to have sufficient funding to finance large-scale campaigns if they are new or have recently obtained under 3% of voters' support. The Democratic Party possessed a large number of properties, which made it possible to finance several political campaigns after sale of these properties. The value of its assets is estimated at PLN 65 to 250 million, as the \"Rzeczpospolita\" newspaper calculated.\n\nAfter 2009 new politicians joined the party, such as centrist-conservative Paweł Piskorski. The party restored their representation in parliament, by taking over of the members of the Democratic Party – demokraci.pl group consisting of three members (including Marian Filar, Bogdan Lis and Jan Widacki). After Paweł Piskorski rise to the leadership of the party many of its old members of party resigned from being members of SD. In the 2009 European Elections, the party's candidates obtained 0.027% of votes because of registration problems and lack of organisation. Since May 2009 the Alliance of Democrats has been a member of the European Democratic Party. SD supportined former Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrzej Olechowski's candidature in the 2010 presidential election. In the 2011 parliamentary elections Alliance did not register any lists but three candidates who were enlisted on the Poland Comes First election list but were supported by SD received 0,0031% of votes. The Party was to announce its new political programme at its XXVI Congress.\n\nBefore 2019 European election SD declared willingness to join European Coalition, however, none of the party members was on its list.\nBefore 2019 parliamentary election SD joined to Polish Coalition. Several members started from PSL list, but it hasn't won any seat in Sejm.\n\n"}

{"id": "2074142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074142", "title": "Donald Cammell", "text": "Donald Cammell\n\nDonald Seton Cammell (17 January 1934 – 24 April 1996) was a Scottish painter, screenwriter, and film director. He has a cult reputation largely due to his debut film \"Performance\", which he wrote the screenplay for and co-directed with Nicolas Roeg.\n\nDonald Cammell was born in the Camera Obscura (then known as the Outlook Tower) on Castlehill, near the castle in Edinburgh, Scotland. He was the elder son of the poet and writer Charles Richard Cammell (who wrote a book on occultist Aleister Crowley) and Iona Macdonald. His middle name Seton came from his godfather, the Scottish naturalist Seton Gordon. He was educated at Shrewsbury House School and Westminster School.\n\nBrought up in a bohemian atmosphere, Donald Cammell was raised in an environment he described as \"filled with magicians, metaphysicians, spiritualists and demons\" including Aleister Crowley.\n\nCammell was a precociously gifted painter, winning a scholarship to the Royal Academy at the age of 16. He subsequently studied in Florence with Annigoni and made his living as a society portrait painter. In 1953, one of his portraits was hailed as \"society portrait of the year\".\n\nAfter the end of a short-lived early marriage, he moved to New York to live with model Deborah Dixon and concentrate on painting nudes.\n\nIn 1961, he moved to Paris and began writing screenplays; first, a thriller called \"The Touchables\", then a collaboration with Harry Joe Brown Jnr called \"Duffy\". This caper movie was directed by Robert Parrish in 1968 (and featured James Fox), an artistic failure that frustrated Cammell to the point that he decided to direct. Through his friendship with Anita Pallenberg, he came into the orbit of the Rolling Stones and moved to London.\n\nAfter \"Performance\", he wrote a script called \"Ishtar\" that was to feature William Burroughs as a judge kidnapped while on holiday in Morocco. Like most of the scripts he worked on, it remained unproduced. His unwillingness to compromise his ideas alienated him from the Hollywood establishment that perceived him as an eccentric troublemaker. Several of Cammell's major frustrations involved Marlon Brando. In 1978, Brando invited Cammell to collaborate on a script called \"Fan Tan\" which Brando soon lost interest in; then he asked Cammell to adapt the script as a novel and again scuttled the project halfway through by losing interest. In 1987, Brando employed Cammell to direct a script he had written called \"Jericho\". After eighteen months of work, while on pre-production in Mexico, Brando again decided he did not want to go through with the project.\n\nThe next project Cammell managed to get made was a short called \"The Argument\" (1971/99) that was shot on location in the Utah desert by Vilmos Zsigmond on the sly. Cammell had obtained the camera on the grounds that Zsigmond was shooting tests for another film. This confrontation between a frustrated film director and a goddess (played by Myriam Gibril, Cammell's lover and Isis to his Osiris in \"Lucifer Rising\") covers many of Cammell’s favourite themes, but Cammell never completed the film. It was rediscovered and put together by his editor, Frank Mazzola, in 1999.\n\nCammell’s next feature was \"Demon Seed\" (1977). Although not a personal project, this science fiction thriller (based on a book by Dean R. Koontz) featured many of Cammell’s obsessions. A super-computer takes over a scientist’s house with his wife (Julie Christie) inside and proceeds to terrorise and ultimately impregnate her. A two-hander between Christie and the computer, \"Demon Seed\"'s mind games and closed environment are reminiscent of \"Performance\", while the idea of the machine giving a child to the heroine and thus providing itself with a human incarnation is another example of Cammell’s fascination with transformative sexuality.\n\nCammell had to wait until 1987 to complete another project, \"White of the Eye\". This study of a serial killer features a return of his cross-cutting techniques (absent from \"Demon Seed\").\n\nCammell was married twice, first to the Greek actress Maria Andipa (m. 1954), by whom he had a son Amadis (b. 1959), and then to the American writer China Kong (m. 1978). He is survived by his son and his second wife.\n\nCammell committed suicide by shotgun in 1996.\n\n\n"}

Svenson in 1973.\n\nDanger is the name of the game when the Hardys agree to help their pen pal from Greece, Evangelos Pandropolos, search for a priceless, ancient Greek helmet. Years ago, Evan's uncle had loaned it to a Hollywood movie company for use in a silent motion picture, \"The Persian Glory\", for a role in the movie, but the treasured helmet was lost after the movie was done.\n\nAt Hunt College, where Evan, Frank, Joe and Chet Morton are taking a summer course in film-making, the boys are harassed by Leon Saffel whose harassments get more and more vicious. All the while a gang is trying to force Mr. Hardy to give up his investigations of a national crime syndicate and also trying to find the helmet, which after speaking to Evan's billionaire uncle, they learn may have belonged to King Agamemnon, making the helmet even more valuable.\n\nThe clues that the Hardys unearth keep them constantly on the move—from their college campus to California and finally to Greece. In a sizzling climax, the Hardys, Evan and Chet match wits with their powerful enemies on the island of Corfu.\n"}

The conditions may be hazardous. Depending on its duration, the overvoltage event can be transient—a voltage spike—or permanent, leading to a power surge.\n\nElectronic and electrical devices are designed to operate at a certain maximum supply voltage, and considerable damage can be caused by voltage that is higher than that for which the devices are rated.\n\nFor example, an electric light bulb has a wire in it that at the given rated voltage will carry a current just large enough for the wire to get very hot (giving off light and heat), but not hot enough for it to melt. The amount of current in a circuit depends on the voltage supplied: if the voltage is too high, then the wire may melt and the light bulb would have \"burned out real time\". Similarly other electrical devices may stop working, or may even burst into flames if an overvoltage is delivered to the circuit.\n\nA typical natural source of transient overvoltage events is lightning. Bursts of solar wind following solar flares are also known to cause overvoltage in electrical circuits, especially onboard space satellites.\n\nMan-made sources of spikes are usually caused by electromagnetic induction when switching on or off inductive loads (such as electric motors or electromagnets), or by switching heavy resistive AC loads when zero-crossing circuitry is not used - anywhere a large change of current takes place. One of the purposes of electromagnetic compatibility compliance is to eliminate such sources.\n\nAn important potential source of dangerous overvoltage is electronic warfare. There is intensive military research in this field, whose goal is to produce various transient electromagnetic devices designed to generate electromagnetic pulses that will disable an enemy's electronic equipment. A recent military development is that of the exploding capacitor designed to radiate a high voltage electromagnetic pulse. Another intense source of an electromagnetic pulse is a nuclear explosion.\n\nWhen Pacific Gas & Electric Company neglected to trim trees that had grown branches into their high power lines, their system caused the world record overvoltage of any power system so far, of 90 minutes in East Palo Alto California on August 25, 2011. The overvoltage caused television sets to catch fire and were thrown out the front doors, exploded light bulbs, fried computers, destroyed surge protectors, blew up the Smart meters, and sparks shot out of wall outlets. The overvoltage only ended when the Smart meters blew up, or after 90 minutes when the power was physically cut. The incident was not reported by PG&E to the California PUC, only that there was a day-long \"outage\" while the exploded system components were being restored. \n\nThe transient pulses can get into the equipment either by power or data lines, or directly through space from a strong electromagnetic field change - an electromagnetic pulse (EMP). Filters are used to prevent spikes entering or leaving the equipment through wires, and the devices coupled electromagnetically to space (such as radio-frequency pick-up coils in MRI scanners) are protected by shielding.\n\n\n\n"}
