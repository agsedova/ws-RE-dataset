It has rhizomes that occur around deep in soil or sometimes deeper. Rhizome growth occurs in the period May to November but is fastest from mid-June to mid-July. The rhizomes have many dormant buds that do not develop unless the rhizomes are disturbed and then fresh aerial shoots may arise from the broken fragments. It flowers from June to July.\n\nThe main distinguishing characteristics from \"H. lanatus\" are the presence of rhizomes, and the bearded nodes or 'hairy knees' on the culm.\n\n\"Holcus mollis\" is favoured by conditions in woodland clearings and at the early stages of coppicing. Growth and flowering are restricted as the tree canopy develops. It is often a relict of former woodland vegetation, surviving in open grassland and grassy heaths after woodland clearance despite being a shade lover. It is found mostly on moist, freely-drained acid soils, normally light to medium texture and high in organic matter; it is absent from areas of calcareous or base rich soil, and often grows with bracken.\n\nThe caterpillars of some Lepidoptera use it as a food plant, e.g. the Essex skipper (\"Thymelicus lineola\").\n\nIn a survey of weeds in conventional cereals in central southern England in 1982, it was found in 1% of winter barley but not at all in winter wheat or spring barley.\n\nEach small piece of rhizome is capable of developing into a new plant. Research shows that within of the surface, of rhizome infested soil may contain up to of rhizome, the weight of roots and rhizomes being estimated at 7.5 tons per acre.\n\nA pentaploid variant of \"H. mollis\" is common in Britain; it is sterile but spreads vegetatively. \"H. mollis\" var. \"variegatus\" has striped green and white leaves; it is sometimes cultivated.\n\nA male sterile hybrid with \"Holcus lanatus\" exists with 2\"n\" = 21 chromosomes. Hybrids tend to resemble \"H. lanatus\" in their morphology.\n"}

{"id": "2260358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260358", "title": "River's Edge", "text": "River's Edge\n\nRiver's Edge is a 1986 American crime drama film directed by Tim Hunter, written by Neal Jimenez, and starring Crispin Glover, Keanu Reeves, Ione Skye, Daniel Roebuck, and Dennis Hopper. It follows a group of teenagers in a Northern California town who are forced to deal with their friend's murder of his girlfriend, and the subsequent disposal of her body. Screenwriter Jimenez partially based the film's script on the 1981 murder of Marcy Renee Conrad in Milpitas, California.\n\nShot in Los Angeles in 1986, the film premiered that year at the Toronto International Film Festival before being purchased for distribution by Island Pictures, who gave the film a theatrical release in the United States in May 1987. Several critics praised the film's performances, and its subject matter resulted in it being classified by several critics as a contemporary-day horror film. It was awarded Best Picture at the 1986 Independent Spirit Awards.\n\nContemporary film scholars have noted \"River's Edge\" as an example of the \"killer kid\" film, as well as one of the most polarizing youth-oriented films of the 1980s. In a 2015 retrospective, \"Salon\" deemed it \"the darkest teen film of all time.\" The film features an original score by Jürgen Knieper, as well as a soundtrack featuring songs from various punk and metal bands, including Slayer, Agent Orange, and the Wipers.\n\nIn Northern California, a preteen boy, Tim, throws a doll into a river. On the opposite bank, he sees teenager John smoking a cigarette; next to him is the nude corpse of his girlfriend, Jamie. Later at a convenience store, Tim encounters an underage John arguing with the clerk over buying beer. Tim returns home where his brother Matt and mother are searching for his little sister's doll. Layne arrives and picks up Matt, and the two drive to the home of Feck, a neurotic ex-biker and drug dealer, to buy marijuana. On the car ride there, Layne recounts a party from the night before where John and Jamie were arguing. At school, Layne and Matt smoke with their friends Clarissa, Maggie, and Tony. Matt talks about wanting to run away to Portland, which Clarissa dismisses. John arrives, and mentions that he killed Jamie. Clarissa and Maggie think he's joking, and leave for class. He brings Layne and Matt to view her body; Matt is disturbed, while Layne is focused on covering up the crime.\n\nThe group all plan to go see Jamie's body that evening, which Clarissa assumes is a practical joke. An older acquaintance, Mike, agrees to drive them in his truck, and they each see Jamie's body for themselves. Later that night, Clarissa calls Matt, but he is reluctant to talk to her. Meanwhile, Layne goes back to the scene and pushes Jamie's body into the river. Later, while driving with John, he notices police cars near John's house. Layne panics, but John remains calm. They drive to Feck's house, and Layne leaves John there to hide. Meanwhile, Matt directs police to the river, where they find Jamie's body washed up on the shore. Matt is subsequently interrogated by police, who threaten to charge him with being an accessory after the fact. Matt returns home and argues with his mother and her boyfriend, and then gets into a fight with Tim, hitting him in the face. After, Tim and his friend Moko steal Moko's father's car to drive to Feck's.\n\nIn the middle of the night, Layne, Clarissa and Matt drive to Tony's house, but Tony's father chases them off with a shotgun. Layne argues with Clarissa and kicks her out of his car. Matt gets out and walks with her. They stop at a convenience store and run into John and Feck. Tim and Moko break into Feck's house in search of a gun, but find his stash of marijuana instead; they each get stoned and pass out in his house. Matt and Clarissa go to a park to talk, where they confide their mutual apathy over Jamie's murder. Meanwhile, John and Feck have gone to the river's edge to drink beer. Feck discusses a murder he committed years prior of his own girlfriend, and John drunkenly begins to brag about killing Jamie, recounting his strangling her to death with relish. Matt and Clarissa have sex in the park nearby before falling asleep, while Layne drives around town in a panic, compulsively taking pills.\n\nAt dawn, John falls asleep on the river bank, and Feck shoots him in the head. He returns to his home, where Tim and Moko accost him and steal his gun. Police find Layne unconscious in his car, and bring him in for questioning. At school, news reporters interview Maggie and Tony, who seem dispassionate. During history class, the teacher, Mr. Burkewaite, discusses morality, and asks Clarissa what Jamie meant to her in front of the class; she doesn't respond. Layne calls Feck's house asking where John is, and Feck tells him he's gone to the river; in the middle of the phone call, police break down Feck's door. The group of teenagers go to the river together, and Layne finds John's body nearby. Tim arrives at the scene with Feck's gun and threatens to kill Matt for hitting him the night before, but Matt talks him out of it.\n\nPolice arrive and escort the teenagers away as medical examiners remove John's body. In the hospital, Feck admits to killing John \"because there was no hope for him,\" and confesses to his girlfriend's murder from years prior. Later, at Jamie's funeral, each of the teenagers show emotion during the wake.\n\n\nFilm scholar Emanuel Levy notes that the film \"addresses the alienation and moral vacancy among American kids growing up in a drug-oriented, valueless culture. \"River's Edge\" has the disturbing quality of a collective fear—the cherished, eagerly awaited adolescence is presented as confusing and vacuous. Unlike most 1980s teenage sex comedies, this film doesn't glamorize youth, instead depicting it as a bleak, aimless coming of age, a time of boredom, stupor, and waste.\" However, Levy writes that the film does share in common with its peers the manner in which it presents adult figures, as \"irresponsible and indifferent.\"\n\nWhile the screenplay is fiction, it draws from the November 3, 1981, murder of Marcy Renee Conrad, who was raped and strangled by Anthony Jacques Broussard in Milpitas, California. Others have noticed similarities between the film and the 1984 murder of Gary Lauwers by his friend, Ricky Kasso. Broussard bragged about the crime, showing the body to at least 13 different people; despite this, the crime went unreported for two days. Screenwriter Neal Jimenez was taking screenwriting courses at the University of California, Los Angeles at the time of Conrad's murder, and admitted to basing the script partially on the event. Jimenez said \"that the incident is merely the inspiration for the screenplay.\"\n\nHemdale Film Corporation expressed interest in Jimenez's script, and agreed to distribute the film with Tim Hunter directing. Producer Midge Sanford recalled: \"Hemdale were a small company that made some very good movies, like \"Salvador\" and \"Hoosiers\". They really responded to the script and said they would finance it with Tim as the director.\" The film was in pre-production for four months, with a final budget of $1.7 million.\n\n\"River's Edge\" was the first major film for many of its actors, including Daniel Roebuck and Ione Skye. On casting Keanu Reeves, casting director Carrie Frazier recalled: \"He walked in the door, and I went, \"Oh my god, this is my guy!\" It was just because of the way he held his body—his shoes were untied, and what he was wearing looked like a young person growing into being a man. I was over the moon about him.\" Ione Skye was cast in the film after a casting director saw a photo of her with her brother, Donovan Leitch, who was an aspiring actor at the time; she had no acting experience, and it was her first film. Auditioning for the role of the brutish Samson, Daniel Roebuck arrived at his audition in full-costume with his hair slicked back with K-Y Jelly, and two beer cans in his front pockets.\n\nFor the part of Feck, director Hunter had wanted John Lithgow; the part was also offered to Harry Dean Stanton, who declined, and passed the script on to his friend, Dennis Hopper, who was cast. Sanford recalled Crispin Glover had auditioned \"with a wig and an outrageous take on the part. He was so out there that Sarah and I were a little nervous about what he was doing. But we trusted him and felt like it would work out in the end.\" Corey Haim was cast in the part of Tim, but had to be replaced by Joshua John Miller after developing pneumonia during the first several days of filming.\n\nDirector Hunter had originally wanted to shoot the film in Los Angeles, but instead opted to shoot near Sacramento due to it having natural locations more conducive to the screenplay. The crew arrived to shoot scenes along the American River, but were forced to leave due to a major flood. Hunter settled on shooting the film in Sunland-Tujunga, Los Angeles, a community in the foothills above Burbank. Hunter stated: \"It was an area where people with tuberculosis could come to sanatoriums for the clean air. By the time we shot \"River's Edge\", it had become a smog pocket—but it was full of river rock houses that gave it a \"land that time forgot\" feeling.\"\n\nThe film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 1986. Producer Midge Sanford recalled the screening leaving the audience divided: \"Some executives from a small distribution company wouldn't look at us [after a festival screening]. People either embraced it or were very put off by it. It didn't get picked up right away.\" The film was ultimately purchased for distribution by Island Pictures, who released the film in the United States on May 8, 1987.\n\n\"River's Edge\" received largely positive reviews from critics. It holds an 87% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 38 reviews with the consensus: \"A harrowing tale of aimless youth, \"River's Edge\" generates considerable tension and urgency thanks to strong performances from a stellar cast including Crispin Glover, Keanu Reeves and Ione Skye.\" At the time of its release, the film was noted by several critics as being a contemporary-day horror film.\n\nGene Siskel ranked \"River's Edge\" as the seventh best film of 1987, while Roger Ebert awarded the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, calling it \"the best analytical film about a crime since \"The Onion Field\" and \"In Cold Blood\".\" Michael Wilmington of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called the film \"a contemporary horror story about teen-agers, but it contains no slasher scenes or serial homicides. Its monsters are all too real.\" \"The New York Times\"s Janet Maslin called the film \"bitter and disturbing\" and deemed the performances \"natural and credible.\" Vincent Canby, also of \"The New York Times\", named the film \"the year's most riveting, most frightening horror film, even if doesn't really belong in the same category with any acknowledged classics of the genre. Metaphysics has nothing to do with \"River's Edge,\" though, like \"Dracula\", it's a tale of the undead.\" David Ansen of \"Newsweek\" called the film \"the scariest vision of youth since the alarming Brazilian movie \"Pixote\"... \"River's Edge\" pitches the audience inside this nightmare world of affectless middle-class kids and lets us watch them wallow their way through moral dilemmas they can only half articulate.\" John Simon of the National Review called River's Edge \"splendid\".\n\nIn a 2015 retrospective, \"Salon\" deemed \"River's Edge\" \"the darkest teen film of all time.\" Film historian Kim Newman named the film \"the definitive killer kid movie... Moral without moralizing, blackly comic without tastelessness, [and] acutely tuned in to the way dead-end teens talk.\"\n\nThe film's soundtrack, released in 1987 by Enigma Records, features various thrash metal, reggae, and punk tracks.\n\n\"River's Edge\" was released on DVD January 23, 2001 by MGM Home Entertainment under their \"Avant-Garde Cinema\" series. A Blu-ray was released by Kino Lorber on January 13, 2015.\n\n\n\n"}

They were forced to walk from Yerevan to Alaverdi by foot (about 160 kilometers) and some of them were killed on the road. These officers were subsequently sent to jails in Baku and Russia. In February 1921, many heroes of the Battle of Sardarabad were shot, including Daniel Bek-Pirumyan, while his brother Poghos Bek-Pirumyan committed suicide after being tortured. Pro-Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) intellectuals were also harassed. Wheat was taken away from villagers without any compensation.\n\nThe repressions by the Bolshevik government of Armenia created widespread discontent and the Armenian Revolutionary Federation began a rebellion on February 13. By February 17 Ashtarak, Ejmiatsin, Garni, and Hrazdan were taken over by ARF forces. On February 18 they entered Yerevan. The Bolsheviks and the Red Army retreated to Artashat. Hovhannes Katchaznouni, Levon Shant, Nikol Aghbalian and 100 other political activists and intellectuals were freed from jails.\n\nAfter the capture of Yerevan, the Salvation Committee of the Fatherland was founded under the leadership of former Prime Minister Simon Vratsian, which was to govern the country until the formation of a new government. The committee addressed the population on February 18 which invoked people to \"protect order and rule, strictly fulfill all the orders of the committee\". Throughout the 42-day rebellion, bloody battles took places between ARF forces and the Bolsheviks. On February 27 the Bolsheviks tried to attack Yerevan but on March 1 they were forced to retreat. After a two-week pause, Bolshevik units again attacked and took over Artashat on March 16 but the next day ARF forces started an offensive and recaptured the town.\n\nThe Bolshevik forces, greatly outnumbering the ARF, began a large offensive on March 24. They captured Aparan, Kotayk and gradually emerging, entered Yerevan on April 2. The ARF forces retreated without any serious battle to avoid the destruction of the capital.\n\nThe \"Salvation Committee of the Fatherland\", ARF forces and many civilians retreated to Zangezur, where they joined Garegin Nzhdeh, where the Republic of Mountainous Armenia was established. It was finally taken over by Bolshevik forces in July 1921. The Armenian leaders escaped to Persia to avoid arrest and possible execution by the Bolsheviks.\n\nThe reasons of the revolt were later discussed by the Bolshevik government and was decided to treat the population with more tolerance. After suppressing the February Uprising, Aleksandr Myasnikyan was appointed Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of Armenia, the newly installed government of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.\n\nOn February 18, the Committee send a message to the Armenian delegation in Paris and to the leaders of world powers (France, United Kingdom, Italy), League of Nations, etc., but it remained unanswered. A message was also sent to the Armenian delegation in Tiflis, Georgia, where after the Sovietization of Armenia, local Armenians were subjected to violence. Georgia responded to the message on February 21, when the Armenian embassy was reopened in Tiflis. Georgia fell to the Soviets on February 25, thereafter the Armenian rebels were left alone against the Bolshevik forces in the Caucasus.\n\n\n\n\np\n"}

{"id": "2260392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260392", "title": "DVD-by-mail", "text": "DVD-by-mail\n\nDVD-by-mail is a business model in which customers rent DVDs and similar discs containing films, television shows, video games and the like, ordering online for delivery to the customer by mail. Generally, all interaction between the renter and the rental company takes place through the company's website, using an e-commerce model. Typically, a customer chooses from a list of titles online and adds titles to a queue. As a customer's requested titles become available, the company sends them out. When the customer is finished with the disc, they mail it back to the company.\n\nMost companies operate on the following model:\n\n\nMost companies let customers keep the films for as long as they want; customers are, however, limited to a set number of discs out at any one time. Commonly, once a disc is returned, another is sent out. Some companies or plans may have a limit on the total number of movies rented in a month. Memberships are usually billed monthly, and includes postage both ways.\n\nVariations exist; for example, some companies also offer video game rentals while others offer music. Redbox allows a user to reserve DVDs or Blu-ray discs online to retrieve and return the DVD at interactive kiosks located in various retail establishments.\n\nNetflix began an online streaming program allowing for the online viewing of select movies and TV shows. However, around 4.2 million individuals in the U.S. still rent DVDs via mail from the company.\n\nGiven sufficiently fast mail delivery, customers on \"unlimited\" plans who return their discs quickly enough can receive enough shipments in a month that the company's cost of delivery exceeds the fixed monthly subscription fee, making this type of customer unprofitable. Even below this point, higher volume customers are less profitable than customers who receive fewer discs per month. If these customers become too numerous, there are various measures which the rental company can take.\n\nOne is the so-called \"throttling\" approach, which received significant publicity with regard to Netflix (which refers to the practice as a \"fairness algorithm\"). In this case, high-volume customers may experience a greater likelihood of (slower) shipments from alternative warehouses, when the nearest shipment center does not have the requested disc. Also, if there is a high demand for a particular disc, it is more likely that an infrequent renter will get priority over the frequent renters, with the latter receiving a movie further down on their list. They are also less likely to receive replacement shipments on the same day a disc is received. Similar \"fair use\" caveats can be found in the Terms and Conditions of leading UK companies such as LOVEFiLM. In Canada, Zip.ca switched to \"Capped\" plans (with additional shipping charges for rentals over the cap) in part to avoid implementing \"throttling\".\n\nLOVEFiLM came under scrutiny from users over its claim to offer \"unlimited\" movie rentals. Some users reportedly found the company used long delays at the shipping stage to reduce the number of films a month a customer can rent. The company was subject to a dispute by the Advertising Standards Authority over the use of the word \"unlimited\" in their advertising. It was revealed that they practised throttling. The company itself claimed that this \"fair usage\" policy means all customers get a similar service.\n\nOn March 2, 2006, Blockbuster announced that their service does not implement throttling. \"We don't prioritize our customers' movie fulfillment based on how often they use our service, and we don't limit the number of movies a subscriber receives each month,\" according to Senior Vice-President Shayne Evangelist. However, the Terms and Conditions each customer has to agree to in order to subscribe to the service states \"BLOCKBUSTER Online reserves the right to determine product allocation among members in its sole discretion. In determining product allocation, we use various factors including, but not limited to, (i) the historical rental volume for each subscriber, (ii) historical number of outstanding rentals relative to the maximum number of outstanding BLOCKBUSTER Online Rentals allowed under a subscriber's plan, and (iii) the average rental queue position of BLOCKBUSTER Online Rentals that have shipped to a subscriber in the past.\"\n\nThe following is a summary of the major DVD-by-mail markets.\n\nNetflix ended 2008 with 9.39 million customers. Blockbuster Video claimed 1 million online customers in August 2005, 2 million by March 2006, and finished the first quarter of 2007 with 3 million. By the end of 2013, Blockbuster had withdrawn from the DVD-by-mail market. Walmart briefly entered the market as well, but withdrew in 2005 and now has a cross-promotional agreement with Netflix. There are a number of smaller companies, some of which target specific niches:\neHit, the first such niche company, came online in 2000 targeting fans of Asian films; specifically Japan, China, and Korea, expanding to include other countries' films over time.\n\nEstimates put the number of Canadian subscribers at 70–80,000, with Zip.ca having had around 50,000 before ceasing operations. Other competitors include Kaku.ca and DVDlink.ca. Cinemail.ca announced it would cease operations at the end of June 2013.\n\nBlockbuster Online started DVD Rentals in Mexico during 2007, after the chain acquired a local startup called MovieNet.\n\nBlockbuster Online started DVD rentals in Brazil during 2006 and now offers Blu-ray plans as well. The 3-disc unlimited rental plan costs R$49.90/month with unlimited exchanges. Along the decade, the number of online rental services in Brazil has rocketed up. Among the most popular are NetMovies and Pipoca Online.\n\nGiven the relatively small geographical area and high population density of the UK, online DVD rentals have some differences from the US, as a single shipping facility can serve the entire country. In April 2006, LoveFilm merged with its major rival Video Island, which had operated ScreenSelect and other brands, and in February 2008, LoveFilm acquired Amazon's DVD rental business in the UK and German markets. In return, Amazon became the largest shareholder of LoveFilm. LoveFilm ceased operating on 31st October 2017. Cinema Paradiso is now the only remaining supplier of rental DVDs in the UK.\n\nThere are several providers in Australia, the most prominent being Quickflix (formerly listed on the Australian Stock Exchange) and BigPond Movies. BigPond Movies announced in June 2011 that they will be pulling out of the DVD-by-mail market at the end of September 2011 and are, instead, offering subscribers the option of downloading movies directly via their proprietary T-box device.\n\nThere were three online DVD rental companies in New Zealand, all offering flat-rate packages. The three companies were DVD Unlimited, Fatso and Movieshack. On June 7, 2008 all three companies merged into Fatso, owned by SKY Network Television. Fatso ceased operations on 23 November 2017 due to declining membership.\n\nHollywoodclicks and Videohub are the two most established online DVD rental services in Singapore. Hollywoodclicks was the first to market, followed by Video Ezy Online. Video Ezy Online rental service was shut down at the start of 2009 and was converted to a home delivery service.\n\nThere are several online DVD rental services in India, all running their own delivery systems and logistics. Unlike online DVD rental companies in other countries, online DVD rental services in India do not use the postal service as a means of delivery or exchange. India's first online DVD rental service Clixflix started in August 2004. Cinesprite, Seventymm and Reliance BigFlix have closed their operations. Clixflix (the oldest) is still in operation in Mumbai.\n\nMajor online rental Blu-ray Disc and DVD companies are Rakuten Rental, Tsutaya Discas, and Posren.\n\n"}

He tells her that he leaving to attend the Cannes Film Festival in France hoping to meet Jana Bates and get her to star in his movie to kickstart his career as a film director. But his mother calls it just another one of his \"crazy ideas.\"\n\nVinny arrives in Cannes. He tries to meet Jana several times, but is turned away. Jana is in Cannes to promote her latest horror film \"Scream\" in which has she has been nominated for Best Actress. Accompanying Jana is her manager and ex-husband Bret Bates, and the film's producer Alan Cunningham, her current beau. Vinny phones Bret, insisting on talking to Jana about his script, but is told only agented scripts are accepted. Shortly afterwards, Jana is at a press conference with Alan when she receives flowers and a note saying, \"You've made your last horror film. Goodbye.\" She goes to see Bret at his hotel room. Entering the bathroom, she finds his bloody stabbed body in the bath. Bret's severed head rolls off into the sink and Jana runs away screaming. When she later returns with the police, the body is gone. Vinny has fantasy scenes of himself being acclaimed as a great director. Meanwhile, he encounters some naked young women bathing at the beach at night and picks up one of their stockings, but is confronted by one of the women who taunts him before running back into the water. The women call him a weirdo and Vinny runs off. \n\nVinny continues following Jana around and filming her with his movie camera. Marty Bernestein runs into Vinny and shrugs him off when Vinny asks him if he is willing to promote his movie. Marty meets with the movie's director Stanley Kline, and his personal assistant Susan Archer, where they reveal that all of them have received the same notes that Jana and Bret received. But when Marty takes his suspicions to the police, they think that Bret's disappearance is another publicity stunt. The next day, Marty gets a letter from Bret to meet him in a theater screening room. When Marty shows up, he is hacked with a hatchet by a hooded figure.\n\nWhile Jana attends more press conferences, Vinny goes to a nightclub where he attacks a stripper after seeing her as Jana. He goes to a local cinema where he watches a gory horror film of Stanley Kline, and runs into him outside the theater. The following day, Susan tells Stanley that she wants to leave Cannes, but he convinces her to stay a while longer. That evening, both of them are killed by the hooded figure atop a building where Stanley is stabbed, and she falls off the building's ledge after getting shot. The killer then takes his movie camera and films all the deaths.\n\nAcross town in Jana's hotel room, Vinny sneaks in with a bottle of champagne and surprises Jana as she is taking a shower. He asks her to appear in his movie, but she insists he leave immediately, causing Vinny to break down in tears. Angered and upset, Vinny smashes the bottle in the sink and threatens Jana with the bottle's jagged edge. When the doorbell rings, Jana shoves Vinny aside and sprints off. Jana, clad only in her bathroom towel, runs screaming through the hotel lobby being chased by Vinny. The people in the lobby think it is another publicity stunt and applaud. Vinny, caught off guard, stops and smiles for them, allowing Jana to escape, who runs into Alan and a group of reporters outside the hotel. After explaining what happened, Alan tells Jana that he will take her away from the city.\n\nThe next day, Alan drives Jana to a remote castle in the French countryside where a musician friend of his named Jonathan is staying. Vinny follows them. That evening, Vinny sneaks into the castle, but is chased away by Jana's bodyguards who accidentally kill Jonathan as he tries to stop Vinny.\n\nAlan and Jana return to Cannes for the awards ceremony where Vinny sneaks into the festivities dressed as a local policeman. While Jana waits in the back wing of the building, Vinny subdues Jana with chloroform and takes the unconscious actress away in his car back to the castle to film a scene there. Vinny films a scene with him playing Dracula and Jana as a victim. Suddenly, Bret Bates shows up with another camera and a pistol, and congratulates Vinny on setting everything up for him. Bret is revealed to be the killer and the mastermind behind this whole thing, not Vinny. Bret reveals that on the day when Vinny phoned him about his movie proposal, he realized that he had the perfect fall guy to set Vinny up for all the killings and to get even with Jana for leaving him. Vinny throws his cape over Bret, distracting him, and runs. But Bret grabs Jana and taunts Vinny to come out in the open. Outside, Vinny turns on a motorcycle's headlights, blinding Bret, and as Jana steps aside, Vinny murders Bret with a chainsaw, via armless and beheaded. As Alan arrives with the police, Vinny stands before Bret's dead body and screams.\n\nThe image falls back to reveal that the whole story is a movie that Vinny filmed at the Cannes Film Festival with Jana Bates, and he is now back in New York showing it to his mother in a screening room. His mother tells Vinny that she is finally proud of him for directing and starring in his first movie, but Vinny explains that it will be his last horror film. As Vinny starts to talk to his mother about ideas for his next movie, she interrupts him to ask for a joint. The two share a smoke as the film ends.\n\n\nNominated: Saturn Award, Best International Film \n\nThe completed movie was first shown on October 9, 1982 at the Sitges Film Festival in Barcelona, Spain. The film went on to win a slew of awards in various film festivals.\n\nThe film was released theatrically in the US, with \"Fanatic\" as its title, in July 1983. It was first released on home video in the USA on May 23, 1984 by Media Home Entertainment.\n\nFeeling that the lack of a DVD release was unjust for such a cult classic, Troma re-released it in this format and later on Blu-ray, as part of their 'Tromasterpiece Collection'. The film is now under its original working title with hours of special features including interviews, commentaries, documentaries, and Spinell's unfinished \".\"\n\n"}

From 1895-1899 he served as an Aide-de-camp to the Governor of Victoria. He retired from the regular army in 1899, but continued as a captain of the reserve in the Dorset Imperial Yeomanry. On 12 March 1902 he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel commanding the North of Ireland Imperial Yeomanry. On 1 January 1913 he was promoted colonel in the Territorial Force and appointed to command the 1st South Western Mounted Brigade; he was granted the temporary rank of brigadier-general on the outbreak of war in 1914. Shaftesbury served through the First World War from 1914 to 1918, and relinquished his appointment as a brigade commander on 1 March 1919, when he was granted the honorary rank of brigadier-general.\n\nLord Shaftesbury was Lord Lieutenant of Belfast from 1904 to 1911, Lord Lieutenant of Antrim from 1911 to 1916, and Lord Lieutenant of Dorset from 1916 to 1952. He was Lord Mayor of Belfast 1907, and Chancellor of Queen's University, Belfast 1909–1923.\n\nAt the Court, Lord Shaftesbury served as Chamberlain to Mary of Teck as Princess of Wales 1901–1910 and as Lord Chamberlain to her as Queen of the United Kingdom 1910–1922. That year he was appointed Lord Steward of the Household, serving until 1936.\n\nOn 15 July 1899, the 9th Earl of Shaftesbury married Lady Constance Sibell Grosvenor (22 August 1875 – 8 July 1957), the daughter of Victor Alexander Grosvenor, styled Earl Grosvenor (son and heir of Hugh Lupus Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster) and his wife, Lady Sibell Mary Lumley, daughter of Richard George Lumley, 9th Earl of Scarbrough. Lady Constance was invested as a Dame of Justice of Order of St. John of Jerusalem (DJStJ) and served as a Lady and Extra Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Mary.\n\nThe 9th Earl of Shaftesbury and his wife, Lady Constance had five children:\n\n\nLord Ashley was heir apparent to the earldom, scheduled to inherit upon the death of his father. However, at age 46, Ashley died unexpectedly of heart disease before succession. At that time, his son, Anthony Ashley-Cooper, became heir apparent, inheriting the earldom in 1961 upon the death of his grandfather.\n\nIn 1928, the 9th Earl provided a financial grant to establish a co-educational independent boarding school in Blandford, north Dorset, England, near the village of Bryanston. The 9th Earl served the school as the first Chairman of the Governors.\n\nBryanston School was founded by a young schoolmaster from Australia named J.G. Jeffreys. He used his confidence and enthusiasm to gain financial support for the school during a period of severe economic instability. With financial backing from the earl, he paid £35,000 for the Bryanston House and its of immediate grounds.\n\nThe school occupies a palatial country house designed and built in 1889–1894 by Richard Norman Shaw and modelled on the chateau at Menars in the Loire valley. Shaw designed the house for Viscount Portman to replace an earlier one. The building and estate was the biggest in Dorset and the last of the grand stately homes to be built in England. The home had been occupied by the Portman family for 30 years at the time of its sale, however, death duties made it impossible for the 4th Lord Portman to hold on to his family estate.\n\nThere were just seven teachers and 23 boys of various ages in the first term. Jeffreys was a natural innovator but one who respected good traditions, reflected in his choice of school motto, \"Et Nova Et Vetera.\" His was the first English school to adopt the Dalton Plan, its combination of the new and the old being of particular appeal. The system was flexible enough to offer a combination of lessons in the classroom and time for assignment work in subject rooms, which gave the students freedom to decide which pieces of academic work to focus their attention. Students were required to keep a daily record on a chart showing their use of working and leisure time, meeting with their tutors on a weekly basis to ensure effective monitoring of their progress.\n\nBryanston is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference and the Eton Group. It has a reputation as a liberal and artistic school. The principles of the Dalton Plan are still in place today and remain central to the school's success.\n\nThe 9th Earl of Shaftesbury presented Belfast Castle to the City of Belfast in 1934. In 1978, Belfast City Council began a major refurbishment over a period of ten years at a cost of over two million pounds. The architect was the Hewitt and Haslam Partnership. The building officially re-opened to the public on 11 November 1988.\n\n\nThe 9th Earl of Shaftesbury died in 1961 aged 91. He was buried in the Parish Church at Wimborne St Giles near the family estate. The earl's titles passed to his 22-year-old grandson, Anthony Ashley-Cooper.\n\nThe 9th Earl had carefully arranged financial matters on the Shaftesbury Estate so that his heirs would avoid death duties. When the earl died in 1961, his grandson inherited the family's 17th-century home and large estate in Dorset, several other properties and a collection of art, antiques, and other valuables. By the 1990s the 10th Earl's wealth was said to be in the \"low millions\".\n"}

{"id": "2260420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260420", "title": "Military Assistance Command, Vietnam – Studies and Observations Group", "text": "Military Assistance Command, Vietnam – Studies and Observations Group\n\nMilitary Assistance Command, Vietnam – Studies and Observations Group (MACV-SOG) was a highly classified, multi-service United States special operations unit which conducted covert unconventional warfare operations prior to and during the Vietnam War.\n\nEstablished on 24 January 1964, the unit conducted strategic reconnaissance missions in the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam), the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam), Laos, and Cambodia; carried out the capture of enemy prisoners, rescued downed pilots, conducted rescue operations to retrieve prisoners of war throughout Southeast Asia, and conducted clandestine agent team activities and psychological operations.\n\nThe unit participated in most of the significant campaigns of the Vietnam War, including the Gulf of Tonkin incident which precipitated increased American involvement, Operation Steel Tiger, Operation Tiger Hound, the Tet Offensive, Operation Commando Hunt, the Cambodian Campaign, Operation Lam Son 719, and the Easter Offensive. The unit was downsized and renamed Strategic Technical Directorate Assistance Team 158 on 1 May 1972, to support the transfer of its work to the Strategic Technical Directorate of the Army of the Republic of Vietnampart of the Vietnamization effort.\n\nThe Studies and Observations Group (also known as SOG, MACSOG, and MACV-SOG) was a top secret, joint unconventional warfare task force created on 24 January 1964 by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as a subsidiary command of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV). The unit would eventually consist primarily of personnel from the United States Army Special Forces, the United States Navy SEALs, the United States Air Force (USAF), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and elements of the United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance units.\n\nThe Studies and Observation Group (as the unit was initially titled) was in fact controlled by the Special Assistant for Counterinsurgency and Special Activities (SACSA) and his staff at the Pentagon. This arrangement was necessary since SOG needed some listing in the MACV table of organization and the fact that MACV's commander, General William Westmoreland, had no authority to conduct operations outside territorial South Vietnam. This command arrangement through SACSA also allowed tight control (up to the presidential level) of the scope and scale of the organization's operations.\nThe mission of the organization was \n\nto execute an intensified program of harassment, diversion, political pressure, capture of prisoners, physical destruction, acquisition of intelligence, generation\nof propaganda, and diversion of resources, against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.\n\nThese operations (OPLAN 34-Alpha) were conducted in an effort to convince North Vietnam to cease its sponsorship of the Viet Cong (VC) insurgency in South Vietnam. Similar operations had originally been under the purview of the CIA, which had carried out the emplacement of agent teams in North Vietnam using air drops and over-the-beach insertions. Under pressure from Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, the program, along with all other agency para-military operations, was turned over to the military in the wake of the disastrous Bay of Pigs Invasion operation in Cuba.\n\nColonel Clyde Russell (SOG's first commander) had difficulty in creating an organization with which to fulfill his mission since, at the time, United States Special Forces were unprepared either doctrinally or organizationally to carry it out. At this point the mission of the Special Forces was the conduct of guerrilla operations behind enemy lines in the event of an invasion by conventional forces, not in the conduct of agent, maritime, or psychological operations. Russell expected to take over a fully functional organization and assumed that the CIA (which would maintain a representative on SOG's staff and contribute personnel to the organization) would see the military through any teething troubles. His expectations and assumptions were incorrect. The contribution of the South Vietnamese came in the form of SOG's counterpart organization (which used a plethora of titles, finally ending with the Strategic Technical Directorate [STD]).\n\nAfter a slow and shaky start, the unit got its operations underway. Originally, these consisted of a continuation of the CIA's agent infiltrations. Teams of South Vietnamese volunteers were parachuted into the north, but the majority were captured soon after their insertions. Maritime operations against the coast of North Vietnam picked up after the delivery of Norwegian-built \"Nasty\" Class Fast Patrol Boats to the unit, but these operations also fell short of expectations.\n\nOn the night of 30–31 July 1964, four SOG vessels shelled two islands, Hon Me and Hon Ngu, off the coast of North Vietnam. This was the first time SOG vessels had attacked North Vietnamese shore facilities by shelling them from the sea. The following afternoon, the destroyer began an electronic intelligence-gathering mission along the coast of North Vietnam, in the Gulf of Tonkin. On the afternoon of 2 August, three s of the Vietnam People's Navy came out from Hon Me and attacked the \"Maddox\". The American vessel was undamaged and the U.S. claimed that one of the attacking vessels had been sunk and that the others were damaged by U.S. carrier-based aircraft. On the night of 3–4 August, three SOG vessels shelled targets on the mainland of North Vietnam. On the night of 4 August, after being joined by the destroyer , \"Maddox\" reported to Washington that both ships were under attack by unknown vessels (assumed to be North Vietnamese).\n\nThis second reported attack led President Lyndon B. Johnson to launch Operation Pierce Arrow, an aerial attack against North Vietnamese targets on 5 August. Johnson also went to the United States Congress that same day and requested the passage of the Southeast Asia Resolution (better known as the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution) asking for the unprecedented authority to conduct military actions in Southeast Asia without a declaration of war.\n\nJohnson's announcement of the incidents involving the destroyers did not mention that SOG vessels had been conducting operations within the same geographic area as the \"Maddox\" immediately before, and during, that cruise. Neither did he mention that on 1 and 2 August Laotian aircraft, flown by Thai pilots, had carried out bombing raids within North Vietnam itself or that a SOG agent team had been inserted into the same relative area and had been detected by the North Vietnamese. Hanoi, which may have assumed that all of these actions signaled an increased level of U.S. aggression, decided to respond (in what it claimed as its territorial waters). Thus, the three P-4s were ordered to attack the \"Maddox.\" The second incident, in which \"Maddox\" and \"Turner Joy\" were claimed to be attacked, never took place. Although some confusion reigned at the time of the second attack, the facts were clear to the administration by the time it went to Congress to obtain the resolution. When confronted by Senator Wayne Morse (who had discovered the existence of SOG's 34-Alpha raids), McNamara lied to him, stating \"Our Navy played absolutely no part in, was not associated with, and was not aware of any South Vietnamese actions.\" Yet both Commander in Chief, Pacific Command (CINCPAC) and he were well aware of the possible connections, at least insofar as they might have existed in the minds of the Hanoi leadership. These events were not disclosed until the publication of the \"Pentagon Papers\" in 1970.\n\nThe last aspect of SOG's original missions consisted of psychological operations conducted against North Vietnam. The unit's naval arm picked up northern fishermen during searches of coastal vessels and detained them on Cu Lao Cham Island off Da Nang, South Vietnam (the fishermen were told that they were, in fact, still within their homeland). The South Vietnamese crews and personnel on the island posed as members of a dissident northern communist group known as the Sacred Sword of the Patriot League (SSPL), which opposed the takeover of the Hanoi regime by politicians who supported the People's Republic of China (PRC). The kidnapped fishermen were well fed and treated, but they were also subtly interrogated and indoctrinated in the message of the SSPL. After a two-week stay, the fishermen were returned to northern waters.\n\nThis fiction was supported by the radio broadcasts of SOG's \"Voice of the SSPL\", leaflet drops, and gift kits containing pre-tuned radios which could only receive broadcasts from the unit's transmitters. SOG also broadcast \"Radio Red Flag,\" programming purportedly directed by a group of dissident communist military officers also within the north. Both stations were equally adamant in their condemnations of the PRC, the South and North Vietnamese regimes, and the U.S. and called for a return to traditional Vietnamese values. Straight news, without propaganda embellishment, was broadcast from South Vietnam via the \"Voice of Freedom\", another SOG creation.\n\nThese agent operations and propaganda efforts were supported by SOG's air arm, the First Flight Detachment. The unit consisted of four heavily modified C-123 Provider aircraft flown by Nationalist Chinese aircrews in SOG's employ. The aircraft flew agent insertions and resupply, leaflet and gift kit drops, and carried out routine logistics missions for SOG.\n\nOn 21 September 1965, the Pentagon authorized MACV-SOG to begin cross-border operations in Laos in areas contiguous to South Vietnam's western border. MACV had sought authority for the launching of such missions (Operation \"Shining Brass\") since 1964 in an attempt to put boots on the ground in a reconnaissance role to observe, first hand, the enemy logistical system known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail (the Truong Son Road to the North Vietnamese). MACV, through the Seventh Air Force, had begun carrying out strategic bombardment of the logistical system in southern Laos in April (Operation Steel Tiger) and had received authorization to launch an all-Vietnamese recon effort (Operation \"Leaping Lena\") that had proven to be a disaster. U.S. troops were necessary and SOG was given the green light.\nOn 18 October 1965, MACV-SOG conducted its first cross-border mission against target D-1, a suspected truck terminus on Laotian Route 165, inside Laos. The team consisted of two U.S. Special Forces soldiers and four South Vietnamese. The mission was deemed a success with 88 bombing sorties flown against the terminus resulting in multiple secondary explosions, but also resulted in SOG's first casualty, Special Forces Captain Larry Thorne in a helicopter crash. William H. Sullivan, U.S. Ambassador to Laos, was determined that he would remain in control over decisions and operations that took place within the supposedly neutral kingdom.\n\nThe civil war that raged intermittently between the communist Pathet Lao (supported by People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) troops) and the Royal Lao armed forces (supported by the CIA-backed Hmong army of General Vang Pao and USAF aircraft) compelled both sides to maintain as low a profile as possible. Hanoi was interested in Laos due only to the necessity of keeping its supply corridor to the south open. The U.S. was involved for the opposite reason. Both routinely operated inside Laos, but both also managed to keep their operations out of sight due to Lao's supposed neutrality pursuant to the 1962 International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos.\n\nAmbassador Sullivan had the task of juggling the bolstering of the inept Lao government and military, the CIA and its clandestine army, the USAF and its bombing campaign, and now the incursions of the U.S.-led reconnaissance teams of SOG. His limitations on SOG's operations (depth of penetration, choice of targets, length of operations) led to immediate and continuous enmity between the embassy in Vientiane and the commander and troops of SOG, who promptly labelled Sullivan the \"Field Marshal.\" The ambassador responded in kind.\n\nRegardless, MACV-SOG began a series of operations that would continue to grow in size and scope over the next eight years. The Laotian operations were originally run by a Command and Control (C&C) headquarters at Da Nang. The teams, usually three Americans and three to 12 indigenous mercenaries, were launched from Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) in the border areas (originally at Kham Duc, Kontum, and Khe Sanh). After in-depth planning and training, a team was airlifted over the border by aircraft provided by the U.S. Marine Corps (who operated in the I Corps area) or by dedicated Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) H-34 Kingbee helicopters of the 219th Squadron, which would remain affiliated with MACV-SOG for its entire history. The team's mission was to penetrate the target area, gather intelligence, and remain undetected as long as possible. Communication was maintained with a forward air control (FAC) aircraft, which would communicate with USAF fighter-bombers if the necessity, or the opportunity to strike lucrative targets, arose. The FAC was also the lifeline through which the team would communicate with its FOB and through which it could call for extraction if compromised.\n\nBy the end of 1965, MACV-SOG had shaken itself out into operational groups commanded from its Saigon headquarters. These included Maritime Operations (OPS-31), which continued harassment raids and support for psychological operations (via kidnapped fishermen); Airborne Operations (OPS-34), which continued to insert agent teams and supplies into the north; Psychological Operations (OPS-33), which continued its \"black\" radio broadcasts, leaflet and gift kit drops, and running the operation at Cu Lao Cham; the revised \"Shining Brass\" program; and Air Operations (OPS-32), which supported the others and provided logistical airlift. Training for SOG's South Vietnamese agents, naval action teams, and indigenous mercenaries (usually Nùng or Montagnards of various tribes) was conducted at the ARVN Airborne training center (Camp Quyet Thang) at Long Thành, southeast of Bien Hoa.}} Training for the U.S. personnel assigned to recon teams (RTs) was conducted at Kham Duc.\n\nDuring 1966 and 1967, it became obvious to MACV that the North Vietnamese were using neutral Cambodia as a part of their logistical system, funneling men and supplies to the southernmost seat of battle. Unknown was the extent of that use. The answer shocked intelligence analysts. Prince Norodom Sihanouk, trying to balance the threats facing his nation, had allowed Hanoi to set up a presence in Cambodia. Although the extension of Laotian Highway 110 into Cambodia in the tri-border region was an improvement to its logistical system, North Vietnam was now unloading communist-flagged transports in the port of Sihanoukville and trucking the cargo to its base areas on the eastern border.\n\nBeginning in 1966, SOG conducted prisoner snatch missions of PAVN soldiers behind enemy lines along the Hồ Chí Minh Trail. No matter the team's primary mission, capturing enemy soldiers always remained the team's secondary mission when the opportunity presented itself due to valuable intelligence gained related to PAVN troop movements, size, and base locations. Teams also received rewards including free R&R trips to Taiwan or Thailand aboard a SOG C-130 blackbird, a $100 bonus for each American, a new Seiko watch and cash to each indigenous member. Recon teams succeeded in capturing 12 enemy soldiers in Laos during that year.\n\nIn April 1967, MACV-SOG was ordered to commence Operation \"Daniel Boone\", a cross-border recon effort in Cambodia. Both SOG and the 5th Special Forces Group had been preparing for just such an eventuality. The 5th SF had gone so far as to create Projects B-56 \"Sigma\" and B-50 \"Omega\", units based on SOG's \"Shining Brass\" organization, which had been conducting in-country recon efforts on behalf of the field forces, awaiting authorization to begin the Cambodian operations. A turf war broke out between the 5th and SOG over missions and manpower. The Joint Chiefs decided in favor of MACV-SOG, since it had already successfully conducted covert cross-border operations. Operational control of \"Sigma\" and \"Omega\" was eventually handed over to SOG.\n\nThe first mission was launched in September and construction was begun on a new C&C at Ban Me Thuot, in the Central Highlands. The recon teams (RTs) inserted into Cambodia faced even more restrictions than those in Laos. Initially, they had to cross the border on foot, had no tactical air support (neither helicopters nor fixed wing), and were not to be provided with FAC coverage. The teams were to rely on stealth and were usually smaller in size than those that operated in Laos.\n\n\"Daniel Boone\" was not the only addition to SOG's size and missions. During 1966, the Joint Personnel Recovery Center (JPRC) was established. The JPRC was to collect and coordinate information on POWs, escapees and evadees, to launch missions to free U.S. and allied prisoners, and to conduct post-search and rescue (SAR) operations when all other efforts had failed. SOG provided the capability to launch \"Brightlight\" rescue missions anywhere in Southeast Asia at a moments notice.\n\nThe Air Operations Group had been augmented in September 1966 by the addition of four specially-modified MC-130E Combat Talon (deployed under \"Combat Spear\") aircraft, officially the 15th Air Commando Squadron, which supplemented the C-123s (\"Heavy Hook\") of the First Flight Detachment already assigned to SOG. Another source of aerial support came from the CH-3 Jolly Green Giant helicopters of D-Flight, 20th Special Operations Squadron 20th SOS (callsign \"Pony Express\"), which had arrived at Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Navy Base during the year. These helicopters had been assigned to conduct operations in support of the CIA's clandestine operations in Laos and were a natural for assisting SOG in the \"Shining Brass\" area. When helicopter operations were finally authorized for \"Daniel Boone\", they were provided by the dedicated support of the Huey gunships and transports of the U.S. Air Force's 20th SOS (callsign \"Green Hornets\").\n\nMACV-SOG reconnaissance teams were also bolstered by the creation of exploitation forces, which could either support the teams in time of need, or launch their own raids against the trail. They consisted of two (later three) \"Haymaker\" battalions (which were never used) divided into company-sized \"Hatchet\" forces which were, in turn, sub-divided into \"Hornet\" platoons. The commanders and non-commissioned officers of these forces were U.S. personnel, usually assigned on a temporary duty basis in \"Snakebite\" teams from the 1st Special Forces Group on Okinawa.\n\nBy 1967, MACV-SOG had also been given the mission of supporting the new \"Muscle Shoals\" portion of the electronic and physical barrier system under construction along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in I Corps. SOG recon teams were tasked with reconnaissance and the hand emplacement of electronic sensors both in the western DMZ (\"Nickel Steel\") and in southeastern Laos.\n\nDue to the disclosure of the cover name \"Shining Brass\" in a U.S. newspaper article, SOG decided that new cover designations were necessary for all of its operational elements. The Laotian cross-border effort was renamed \"Prairie Fire\" and it was combined with \"Daniel Boone\" in the newly created Ground Studies Group (OPS-35). All operations conducted against North Vietnam were now designated \"Footboy\". These included \"Plowman\" maritime missions, \"Humidor\" psychological operations, \"Timberwork\" agent operations, and \"Midriff\" air missions.\n\nNever happy with its long-term agent operations in North Vietnam, SOG decided to initiate a new program whose missions would be shorter in duration, conducted closer to South Vietnam, and carried out by smaller teams. Every effort would be expended to retrieve the teams when their missions were accomplished. This was the origin of STRATA, the all-Vietnamese Short Term Roadwatch and Target Acquisition teams. After a slow initial start, the first agent team was recovered from the north. Following missions were plagued with difficulties, but, after additional training, the team's performance improved dramatically.\n\nFor MACV and SOG, 1968 was a black year. The year saw the Tet Offensive, the largest PAVN/Viet Cong offensive thus far in the conflict, but the collapse of SOG's northern operations. Although the Tet Offensive was contained and rolled back, and significant casualties were inflicted upon the enemy, the mood of the American people and government had turned irrevocably against an open-ended commitment by the United States. For most of the year MACV-SOG's operations centered around in-country missions in support of field forces. Since the enemy had to come out from his cover and launched conventional operations, the U.S. and South Vietnam lost no opportunity in engaging them. General Westmoreland, encouraged by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, requested 200,000 more troops, under the stipulation that they would be used to conduct cross-border operations to pursue the foe. This was the logical military move at this point in the conflict, but it was already too late. In 1968, SOG recon teams conducted hundreds of missions gathering valuable intelligence but suffered 79 SF troops killed in action or missing. MACV-SOG captured three PAVN soldiers from Cambodia and one from Laos.\n\nPresident Johnson sought a way out of the commitment that he had originally escalated. Politically, this was late in coming, but Washington had finally awakened to its predicament. Johnson attempted to get Hanoi to reopen peace negotiations and the carrot he offered was the cessation of all U.S. operations against North Vietnam north of the 20th parallel. Hanoi had only sought an end to the air campaign against the north (Operation Rolling Thunder), but Johnson went one further by calling a halt to all northern operations, both overt and covert. This order effectively ended MACV-SOG's agent team, propaganda, and aerial operations.\n\nIn reality, for MACV-SOG, the point was moot. Suspicions abounded within the organization that Operation \"Timberwork\" had been penetrated by North Vietnamese \"dich van\" agents. Intelligence returns from the northern agent teams had been disappointing and more than three-quarters of the agents inserted had been captured either during or not long after their insertion. The fact that SOG had followed the CIA's failed formula for three years was not considered a contributing factor. The unit was more concerned over Washington's continuous rejection of one of the original goals of the operation: the formation of a resistance movement by potential dissident elements in North Vietnam. Washington's stated goal in the conflict was a free and viable South Vietnam, not the overthrow of the Hanoi regime. The conundrum was what would happen had the program succeeded. The best possible outcome would have been a repeat of the ill-fated Hungarian revolution of 1956, crushed by the Soviet Union, and about which the U.S. could do nothing.\n\nSome American writers on the subject (including many ex-SOG personnel) blamed the failure of the operations on the penetration of the unit by enemy spies – a claim not entirely unsupported by facts. Others, however, laid more of the blame on the operational ineptitude of SOG, which simply continued to repeat a failed formula. Changes to the infiltration program (in the form of the diversionary Operation \"Forae\"), spurred by suspicions at headquarters, came only in 1967.\n\nThe security apparatus of North Vietnam had decades in which to learn to cope with not only the CIA's program, but with the unconventional and covert operations of its French predecessors. The CIA had been loath to conduct such operations in the north, since similar operations in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and the PRC had been abject failures and North Vietnam was considered an even tougher target to penetrate.\n\nNorth Vietnamese security forces simply captured a team, turned its radio operator, and continued to broadcast as though nothing had happened. Supplies and reinforcements were requested, parachuted in to the requesting team's location, and were likewise captured. During the period 1960–1968 both the CIA and MACV-SOG dispatched 456 South Vietnamese agents to their deaths or long incarcerations in northern prisons. Hanoi continued this process year after year, learning SOG's operational methods and bending them to its purpose. In the end, it was running one of the most successful counterintelligence operations of the post-Second World War period.\n\nOn the night of 22–23 August as part of the Phase III Offensive a company from the VC R20 Battalion and a sapper platoon infiltrated MACV-SOG's Forward Operating Base 4, a compound just south of Marble Mountain Air Facility, killing 17 Special Forces soldiers (their largest one-day loss of the war) and wounding another 125 Allied troops. Thirty-two VC were killed.\n\nWith the deflation of its northern operations (although the JCS demanded that SOG retain the capability of reinitiating them), SOG concentrated its efforts on supporting \"Commando Hunt\", the Seventh/Thirteenth Air Force's anti-infiltration campaign in Laos. By 1969 the Ground Studies Group was running its operations from C&Cs at Da Nang for operations in southeastern Laos and at Ban Me Thuot for its Cambodian operations. That year they were joined by a new C&C at Kontum, for operations launched into the triborder region of the \"Prairie Fire\" and the northern area of \"Daniel Boone\", which was renamed \"Salem House\" that year. Each of the C&Cs was now fielding battalion-size forces, and the number of missions rose proportionately.\n\nCommand and Control North (CCN) at Da Nang, commanded by a lieutenant colonel, used 60 recon teams and two exploitation battalions (four companies of three platoons). Command and Control Central (CCC) at Kontum, also commanded by a lieutenant colonel, used 30 teams and one exploitation battalion. During 1969 404 recon missions and 48 exploitation force operations were conducted in Laos. To give an example of the cost of such operations, during the year 20 Americans were killed, 199 wounded, and nine went missing in the \"Prairie Fire\" area. Casualties among the Special Commando Units (SCUs – pronounced Sues), as the indigenous mercenaries were titled, were: 57 killed, 270 wounded, and 31 missing. Command and Control South (CCS) at Ban Me Thuot, also commanded by a lieutenant colonel, consisted of 30 teams and an exploitation battalion. Since the use of exploitation forces was forbidden in Cambodia, these troops were utilized in securing launch sites, providing installation security, and conducting in-country missions. During the year, 454 reconnaissance operations were conducted in Cambodia.\n\nThe teams were ferried into action by RVNAF H-34 Kingbees of the 219th Helicopter Squadron and assorted U.S. Army aviation units in the \"Prairie Fire\" area, and by the USAF helicopters of the 20th SOS in the \"Salem House\" area. By the end of 1969, SOG was authorized 394 U.S. personnel, but it is useful to compare those numbers to the actual strengths of the operational elements. There were 1,041 Army, 476 Air Force, 17 Marine Corps, and seven CIA personnel assigned to those units. They were supported by 3,068 SCUs, and 5,402 South Vietnamese and third-country civilian employees, leading to a total of 10,210 military personnel and civilians either assigned to or working for MACV-SOG.\n\nThe mission of the Ground Studies Group was to support the sensor-driven Operation \"Commando Hunt\", which saw the rapid expansion of the bombing of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. This was made possible by the close-out of \"Rolling Thunder\", which freed up hundreds of aircraft for interdiction missions. Intelligence for the campaign was supplied by both the recon teams of MACV-SOG and by the strings of air-dropped electronic sensors of Operation Igloo White (the successor to \"Muscle Shoals\"), controlled from Nakhon Phanom. 1969 saw the apogee of the bombing campaign, when 433,000 tons of bombs were dropped on Laos. SOG supported the effort with ground reconnaissance, sensor emplacement, wiretap, and bomb damage assessment missions. The cessation of the bombing of the north also freed the North Vietnamese to reinforce their anti-aircraft defenses of the trail system and aircraft losses rose proportionately.\n\nBy 1969, the North Vietnamese had also worked out their doctrine and techniques for dealing with the recon teams. Originally, the PAVN had been caught unprepared and had been forced to respond in whatever haphazard manner local commanders could organize. Soon, however, an early warning system was created by placing radio-equipped air watch units within the flight paths between the launch sites and Base Areas. Within the Base Areas, lookouts were placed in trees and platforms to watch likely landing zones while the roads and trails were routinely swept by security forces. The PAVN also began to organize and develop specialized units that would both drive and then fix the teams so that they could be destroyed. By 1970, they had created a layered and effective system, and SOG recon teams found their time on the ground both shortened and more dangerous. The mauling or wiping out of entire teams began to become a less uncommon occurrence.\n\nSince his election in 1968, President Richard M. Nixon had been seeking a negotiated settlement to the Vietnam War. In 1970, he saw an opportunity to buy time for the Saigon government during Vietnamization, the phased withdrawal of U.S. troops that began in the previous year. He also sought to convince Hanoi that he meant business. That opportunity was provided by the overthrow of Cambodia's Prince Sihanouk by the pro-American General Lon Nol.\n\nNixon had escalated U.S. involvement in Cambodia by authorizing the secret Operation Menu bombings and by the time of Sihanouk's ouster, the program had been in operation for 14 months. Lon Nol promptly ordered North Vietnamese personnel out of the country. North Vietnam responded with an invasion of the country launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge following negotiations with Nuon Chea. Nixon then authorized a series of incursions by U.S. and South Vietnamese ground forces that began on 30 April. With intelligence on communist Base Areas in eastern Cambodia gleaned from MACV-SOG, huge stockpiles of PAVN arms, ammunition, and supplies were overrun and captured. In May, Operation \"Freedom Deal\", a continuous aerial campaign against the PAVN/Viet Cong and the Khmer Rouge was initiated. SOG recon teams in Cambodia now had all the air support that they needed.\n\nAs a result of U.S. political reaction, on 29 December the Cooper-Church Amendment was passed by Congress, prohibiting participation by U.S. ground forces in any future operations in either Cambodia or Laos. U.S. participation in Cambodian operations (which were already being turned over to all-Vietnamese teams) ended on 1 July 1970 and the same stipulation was to apply in Laos no later than 8 February 1971 (the only qualifications to the restrictions, in both operational areas, were in case of either POW rescue missions or aircraft crash site inspections). Although unknown to the U.S. public, many MACV-SOG veterans participated in Operation Ivory Coast, the Son Tay POW camp raid carried out in North Vietnam on 21 November 1970. The deputy commander of the joint rescue force was Colonel Arthur \"Bull\" Simons, who had created SOG's cross-border effort in 1965.\n\nBy 1971 the U.S. was steadily withdrawing from Southeast Asia. As a test of Vietnamization, Washington decided to allow the South Vietnamese to launch Operation Lam Son 719, the long-sought incursion into Laos whose aim would be the cutting the Ho Chi Minh Trail. MACV and the South Vietnamese had been planning just such an operation as far back as August 1964, but the concept was continuously turned down due to the fallout that would have been incurred by the invasion of supposedly \"neutral\" Laos. The Laotian government (supported by Ambassador Sullivan and the State Department) was adamantly opposed to such an operation. On 8 February, 16,000 (later 20,000) South Vietnamese troops, backed by U.S. helicopter and air support, rolled into Laos along Route 9 and headed for the PAVN logistical hub at Tchepone. Unlike the Cambodian incursion, however, the North Vietnamese stood and fought, gradually mustering 60,000 troops. By 25 March, the South Vietnamese forces retreated. Ironically, MACV-SOG's role in the operation was only peripheral. Recon teams conducted diversionary operations prior to the invasion and helped cover the South Vietnamese withdrawal, but they were otherwise forbidden from participation in the very operation that both MACV-SOG and MACV had come to consider its \"raison d'etre.\"\n\nIn Laos, the North Vietnamese cleared their logistical corridor to the west for security reasons and increased their aid and support for the Pathet Lao. Fighting that once was seasonal became continuous and conventional. The Cambodian Civil War would escalate with the PRC backed Khmer Rouge (also backed by the exiled Sihanouk), fighting Lon Nol's central government. Following US withdrawal from Indochina, its allies in Laos and Cambodia would collapse to the North Vietnamese backed forces.\n\nThe American withdrawal from South Vietnam began to directly affect SOG in 1971. By early 1972 U.S. military personnel were forbidden from conducting operations in either Laos or Cambodia, its teams of mercenary SCUs continued those operations (in the newly renamed \"Phu Dung\"/\"Prairie Fire\" and \"Thot Not\"/\"Salem House\" areas). The organization did, however, maintain its strength in U.S. personnel, who continued to conduct in-country missions. It was also continuously tasked by the JCS with maintaining forces in readiness to once again take up northern operations if called upon to do so.\n\nThe \"Nguyen Hue Offensive\", launched by North Vietnamese forces on 30 March 1972 (called the Easter Offensive in the West), made cross-border operations irrelevant. As with Tet, all of MACV-SOG/STD's efforts were concentrated on in-country missions to support the Field Forces.\n\nIn late March 1971, when the 5th Special Force Group was redeployed to the U.S., the Command and Control elements were renamed Task Force Advisory Elements (TF1AE, TF2AE and TF3AE). They originally consisted of 244 U.S. and 780 indigenous personnel each, but they were quickly drawn down by the elimination of the exploitation forces. For SOG, Vietnamization was finally nigh. On 1 May 1972, the unit was reduced in strength and renamed the Strategic Technical Directorate Assistance Team 158 (STDAT-158). The Ground Studies Group was disestablished and replaced by the Liaison Service Advisory Detachments. SOG's air elements stood down for redeployment, the JPRC was turned over to MACV and redesignated the Joint Casualty Resolution Center, while the psychological operations personnel and installations were turned over to either the STD or JUSPAO. The final casualty of SOG ground operations occurred on 11 October 1971 when Sergeant First Class Audley D. Mills was killed when a booby-trap he was trying to disarm detonated.\n\nThe function of STDAT-158 was to assist the STD in a complete takeover of SOG's operations. The operational elements had already been absorbed and were expanded by the inclusion of troops from the now-disbanded South Vietnamese Special Forces. The task of the American personnel was to provide technical support (in logistics, communications, etc.) and advice to the STD. This the unit did until its disbandment on 12 March 1973. The South Vietnamese General Staff, strapped for cash and equipment in the final stand-down period, never used the STD in a strategic reconnaissance role. Instead, the STD's units were launched on in-country missions until the dissolution of their parent organization in March 1973.\n\nIn January 1973, President Nixon ordered a halt to all U.S. combat operations in South Vietnam and, on the 27th of that month, the Paris Peace Accords were signed by the belligerent powers in Paris. On 21 February, a similar accord was signed on Laos, ending the bombing of that country and instituting a cease fire. On the 29th, MACV was disestablished and remaining U.S. troops began leaving the south. On 14 August the U.S. Air Force ceased its bombing of Cambodia, bringing all military actions by the U.S. in Southeast Asia to an end.\n\nThe U.S. military (and MACV-SOG personnel) kept tight security over knowledge of the unit's operations and existence until the early 1980s. Although there had been some small leaks by the media during the conflict, they were usually erroneous and easily dismissed. More specific was the release of documents dealing with the early days of the operation in the \"Pentagon Papers\" and by the testimony of ex-SOG personnel during congressional investigations into the bombing campaigns in Laos and Cambodia in the early 1970s. Historians interested in the unit's activities had to wait until the early 1990s, when MACV-SOG's Annexes to the annual MACV Command Histories and a Pentagon documentation study of the organization were declassified for the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs' hearings on the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue.\n\nOne early source of information (if one read between the lines) were the citations issued for the award of the Medal of Honor to MACV-SOG personnel (although they were never recognized as such). One USAF helicopter pilot, two U.S. Navy SEALs, one U.S. Army medic, and nine Green Berets earned the nation's highest award on SOG operations:\n\n\nTwenty-two other members of the unit received the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation's second highest award for valor. On 4 April 2001, the U.S. Army officially recognized the bravery, integrity, and devotion to duty of its covert warriors by awarding the unit a Presidential Unit Citation during a ceremony at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the home of U.S. Army Special Forces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnpublished government documents\n\nPublished government documents\n\nMemoirs and autobiographies\n\nSecondary sources\n\n"}

It was written by Beyoncé, Scott Storch and Robert Waller and produced by Storch with guitar played by musician Aaron Fishbein. Beyoncé decided that she wanted a deeper and more personal song as the third single; the song was sent by Columbia Records and Music World Entertainment to contemporary hit radio in the United States on October 19, 2003. \"Me, Myself and I\" is an R&B song about dealing with a philandering partner and learning from the consequences.\n\nThe live performance of the song from \"The Beyoncé Experience Live\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance in 2009, and the original version earned Beyoncé, Storch and Waller an ASCAP Pop Music Award. \"Me, Myself and I\" peaked at number four on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, becoming Beyoncé's fourth consecutive top-five single in the United States. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The single reached the top twenty in Australia, the Netherlands, Scotland and the United Kingdom.\n\nDirected by Johan Renck, the accompanying music video follows the plot of the song's theme and the events in the video are played in reverse. \"Me, Myself and I\" was part of Beyoncé's set lists on the Dangerously in Love Tour (2003), Verizon Ladies First Tour (2004), The Beyoncé Experience (2007), the I Am... World Tour (2009–10) and The Formation World Tour (2016)\n\nAfter the release of her former group Destiny's Child's third studio album \"Survivor\" (2001), Beyoncé worked on her debut solo studio album, \"Dangerously in Love\". She stated that it was more personal than her previous records because she only had to write for herself. She contacted various musical collaborators, including Storch and Waller. The musical style of \"Me, Myself and I\" is different from the style of her previous singles; Beyoncé decided that she wanted a deeper and more personal song for the next single. Following the release of the song, Beyoncé told Corey Moss of MTV News: \"['Me, Myself and I'] is really powerful. It talks about women basically listening to their inner voice and knowing that they will never disappoint themselves.\"\n\n\"Me, Myself and I\" was the third single released from \"Dangerously in Love\", which followed \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\". It was sent to rhythmic contemporary and urban contemporary radio on October 19, 2003. A CD single was released on October 21, 2003 in the United States, which contained Junior Vasquez's dance radio mix of \"Krazy in Luv\" as its B-side. It officially impacted contemporary hit radio in the United States on November 12, 2003. On December 16, 2003, a 12-inch single was released in the United States. The single was released in selected European countries in January 2004, including Austria, Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\n\"Me, Myself and I\" was first released in the United Kingdom as a maxi single on January 6, 2004. A week later, it was released as a double CD single; the first disc included a radio edit of the song and \"Dangerously in Love 2\" (2003), and the second one contained two remixes of \"Me, Myself and I\". In 2004, the single was also released in the United Kingdom on an enhanced CD that included videos of live performances of \"Naughty Girl\" (2003) and \"Work it Out\" (2002). In Canada, a CD single was released on December 30, 2003, featuring the album version and two remixes of the track. A CD single was released in Australia on January 16, 2004, which included the radio edit and three remixes of the track. The song was also released as a maxi single on January 19, 2004 and later as a three-track single in Germany.\n\nAccording to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, \"Me, Myself and I\" is an R&B song performed in a moderately slow manner. It is written in the key of D♭ major; the tempo is set to eighty-four beats per minute, in common time. The chord follows the E♭m-Fm-G♭ keys, appearing every other bar, and the song has a string arrangement. According to Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork Media, the song's instrumentation consists of a blending of funk keyboards, a slippery bass and minimal, programmed R&B percussion instruments.\n\"Me, Myself and I\" is \" ... replete with strong woman lyrics about holding one's head up high after a traumatic break-up.\" The lyrics are constructed in the common verse-chorus form, each written in two stanzas. The song includes an intro and a bridge that appears between the second and final choruses. In an interview with Corey Moss of MTV News, Beyoncé explained the lyrical content of the song:\n\n... [Me, Myself and I] basically talks about a girl who the guy's not right for her and he's cheating and whatever. And usually women feel stupid and silly and they blame themselves 'cause you have all the signs most of the time, but you love the guy so you don't want to see them go. And in this song, it's kind of like a celebration of the breakup ...\nAccording to Neil Drumming of \"Entertainment Weekly\", \"Me, Myself and I\" is similar to \"Say My Name\" (2000), in terms of \" ... its specificity and earnestness ... \" and the way Beyoncé defends \" ... her chastity [a]gainst some greedy boy ... .\" This was echoed by James Poletti of Yahoo! Music who wrote that the song hints at what is to come as the warbling begins to move into overdrive on \" ... a faintly sickly, if admirably slick, ode to that old Destiny's Child staple ... \", independence and self-belief in the face of a cheating man.\n\nMark Anthony Neal of PopMatters said: \"Beyoncé sounds assured\" in her singing of the song and \" ... lacking any of the 'shrill overboard' that describes some of the 'melisma fits' ... that marked earlier vocal efforts.\" Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork Media noted the song as the \"most notable 80s throwback\" of the album, as its \"augmented chords\" call to mind Patti Austin and James Ingram's 1983 single \"Baby Come to Me\" and Michael Jackson's 1983 single \"Human Nature\", or a decelerated version of \"Baby Be Mine\", from Jackson's 1982 album, \"Thriller\". Neil Drumming of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said: \"Me, Myself, and I\" rides Storch's signature gangsta guitar, mellowed for Beyoncé's lovesick lament ...  While reviewing Beyoncé second studio album, \"B'Day\" in 2006, Andy Kellman of Allmusic remarked that there are no songs with the \" ... smooth elegance of 'Me, Myself and I'\". Spence D., writing for IGN Music considered \"Me, Myself and I\" as a typical sounding R&B ballad with a familiar theme, and in which Beyoncé sings with passion.\n\nAt the 2005 American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers Pop Music Awards, Beyoncé received the Songwriter of the Year award, sharing it with Storch and Waller. It was recognized as Most Performed Song in 2005, alongside Beyoncé's \"Baby Boy\" and \"Naughty Girl\". Beyoncé's live version of \"Me, Myself and I\" from \"The Beyoncé Experience Live\" gained a nomination for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance at the 2009 Grammy Awards.\n\n\"Me, Myself and I\" failed to equal the chart-topping performances of \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\". However, like \"Baby Boy\" and \"Naughty Girl\", \"Me, Myself and I\" attained more immediate and commercial success than its predecessors. After its release, the album ascended the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart and was certified as multi-platinum. On November 16, 2003, the single debuted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number 96, while \"Baby Boy\" was still at number one. 14 weeks after its debut, the single peaked at number 4 for two weeks, becoming the third consecutive top five release from \"Dangerously in Love\" and Beyoncé's fourth consecutive top five hit. \"Me, Myself and I\" remained on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart for 24 weeks. On January 30, 2009, the single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). By October 6, 2010. \"Me, Myself and I\" had sold 119,000 CD copies in the US.\n\nThe single was less successful internationally, peaking below the top 10. It reached number 11 in Australia and the UK, and the top 20 in the New Zealand and the Netherlands. It stayed in the UK Top 100 for seven weeks, and was the second shortest presence on a singles chart, after her 2009 duet with Lady Gaga on the extended remix version of \"Video Phone\".\n\nFollowing her first two videos with Jake Nava, Beyoncé hired Johan Renck to direct the music video for \"Me, Myself and I\". While premiering the video MTVs \"Total Request Live\" on December 10, 2003, Beyoncé described the video's conception,\nWhen some of the behind-the-scenes footage was used in a \"BET Access Granted\" special, some of the scenes that Beyoncé was shown shooting did not appear in the finished video. Beyoncé said that the video did not turn out the way she wanted it to be and she had to reshoot most of it. In post-production, she decided that it would be more artistic to play the events in reverse.\n\nThe footage follows the plot of the song's theme, in which Beyoncé deals with a cheating boyfriend when she finds his mistress' red panties. From the aftermath of the affair, Beyoncé discards her old possessions that reminds her of her boyfriend (e.g. scratching his car). She goes back to the hotel, removes her jewellery and makeup and laments over her ex-boyfriend in the bathtub. As a result, Beyoncé cuts her hair short into a bob as she dresses up and goes out in her bare feet. The events in the video are played in reverse. Beyoncé said that this music video was the hardest video she had ever made. \"Philadelphia\"'s Patrick DeMarco described the video as \"sexy\". In 2004, the video was nominated for Best R&B Video at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards. In May 2010, an alternative version of the video was released; this does not show the events in reverse and includes some of the scenes that were not included in the first version.\n\nDuring the Verizon Ladies First Tour which also featured Alicia Keys, Missy Elliott and Tamia, Beyoncé performed \"Me, Myself and I\" in New York City to an audience of over 20,000. Before singing, she told the audience that she was going to sing about \"a relationship horror story\". She pulled a pair of red panties out of her purse, saying that these were not hers but belonged to her cheating boyfriend's mistress. During the performance, Beyoncé held out the microphone for the audience's response, which was \"is all I got in the end\". She shouted that she wanted to hear everybody from front to back, and continued singing, then told the audience that she wrote the song for \"each and every one of y'all!\".\n\n\"Me, Myself and I\" was also included on the set list of Beyoncé's Dangerously in Love World Tour that began in late 2003. During the tour, Beyoncé appeared suspended from the ceiling of the arena, and was lowered onto a red lounger. The song was performed as part of Beyoncé's The Beyoncé Experience in Los Angeles and her I Am... Tour. On August 5, 2007, Beyoncé performed the song at the Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. Before the song, Beyoncé told the audience that it was very special to her and that she was going to perform a slower version. She was accompanied by her all-female band. Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" complimented the performance, stating: \"Beyoncé needs no distractions from her singing, which can be airy or brassy, tearful or vicious, rapid-fire with staccato syllables or sustained in curlicued melismas. But she was in constant motion, strutting in costumes (most of them silvery), from miniskirts to formal dresses, flesh-toned bodysuit to bikini to negligee.\" Shaheem Reid of MTV News also praised the performance, and wrote: \" ... For all the dancing she did, Beyoncé got an equally big — if not more resounding — response for displaying her undeniable vocal ability on the ballads like \"Me, Myself and I\". \"\n\nIn Los Angeles, Beyoncé gave a full-length performance of \"Me, Myself and I\" without backup dancers and with limited live instrumentation. Beyoncé wore a green belly dancing costume. When Beyoncé performed the song in Sunrise, Florida on June 29, 2009, she wore a leotard. As she sang, animated graphics of turntables, faders and other club equipment were projected behind the dancers and musicians. Beyoncé was accompanied by two drummers, two keyboardists, a percussionist, a horn section, three imposing backup vocalists called the Mamas, bass guitarist Divinity Roxx and lead guitarist Bibi McGill. \"Me, Myself and I\" was included on Beyoncé's album \"The Beyoncé Experience Live\" (2007)\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This classification is a part of the Eastern Woodlands. The concept of a southeastern cultural region was developed by anthropologists, beginning with Otis Mason and Frank Boas in 1887. The boundaries of the region are defined more by shared cultural traits than by geographic distinctions. Because the cultures gradually instead of abruptly shift into Plains, Prairie, or Northeastern Woodlands cultures, scholars do not always agree on the exact limits of the Southeastern Woodland culture region. Shawnee, Powhatan, Waco, Tawakoni, Tonkawa, Karankawa, Quapaw, and Mosopelea are usually seen as marginally southeastern and their traditional lands represent the borders of the cultural region.\n\nThe area was linguistically diverse, major language groups were Caddoan and Muskogean, besides a number of language isolates.\n\nThe following section deals primarily with the history of the peoples in the lengthy period before European contact. Evidence of the preceding cultures have been found primarily in archeological artifacts, but also in major earthworks and the evidence of linguistics. In the Late Prehistoric time period in the Southeastern Woodlands, cultures increased agricultural production, developed ranked societies, increased their populations, trade networks, and intertribal warfare. Most Southeastern peoples (excepting some of the coastal peoples) were highly agricultural, growing crops like maize, squash, and beans for food. They supplemented their diet with hunting, fishing, and gathering wild plants and fungi.\n\nBelonging in the Lithic stage, the oldest known art in the Americas is the Vero Beach bone found in present-day Florida. It is possibly a mammoth bone, etched with a profile of walking mammoth; it dates to 11,000 BCE.\n\nThe Poverty Point culture inhabited portions of the state of Louisiana from 2000–1000 BCE during the Archaic period. Many objects excavated at Poverty Point sites were made of materials that originated in distant places, indicating that the people were part of an extensive trading culture. Such items include chipped stone projectile points and tools; ground stone plummets, gorgets and vessels; and shell and stone beads. Stone tools found at Poverty Point were made from raw materials that can be traced to the relatively nearby Ouachita and Ozark mountains, as well as others from the more distant Ohio and Tennessee River valleys. Vessels were made from soapstone which came from the Appalachian foothills of Alabama and Georgia. Hand-modeled lowly fired clay objects occur in a variety of shapes including anthropomorphic figurines and cooking balls.\n\nMississippian cultures flourished in what is now the Midwestern, Eastern, and Southeastern United States from approximately 800 CE to 1500 CE, varying regionally. After adopting maize agriculture the Mississippian culture became fully agrarian, as opposed to the preceding Woodland cultures that supplemented hunting and gathering with limited horticulture. Mississippian peoples often built platform mounds. They refined their ceramic techniques and often used ground mussel shell as a tempering agent. Many were involved with the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, a multi-regional and multi-linguistic religious and trade network that marked the southeastern part of the Mississippian Ideological Interaction Sphere. Information about Southeastern Ceremonial Complex primary comes from archaeology and the study of the elaborate artworks left behind by its participants, including elaborate pottery, conch shell gorgets and cups, stone statuary, and Long-nosed god maskettes. The Calusa peoples, of southern Florida, carved and painted wood in exquisite depictions of animals.\n\nBy the time of European contact the Mississippian societies were already experiencing severe social stress. Some major centers had already been abandoned. With social upsets and diseases unknowingly introduced by Europeans many of the societies collapsed and ceased to practice a Mississippian lifestyle, with an exception being the Natchez people of Mississippi and Louisiana. Other tribes descended from Mississippian cultures include the Alabama, Biloxi, Caddo, Choctaw, Muscogee Creek, Tunica, and many other southeastern peoples.\n\nDuring the Indian Removal era of the 1830s, most southeastern tribes were forcibly relocated to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River by the US federal government, as European-American settlers pushed the government to acquire their lands. Some members of the tribes chose to stay in their homelands and accept state and US citizenship; others simply hid in the mountains or swamps and sought to maintain some cultural continuity. Since the late 20th century, descendants of these people have organized as tribes; in a limited number of cases, some have achieved federal recognition but more have gained state recognition through legislation at the state level.\n\nFrank Speck identified several key cultural traits of Southeastern Woodlands peoples. Social traits included having a matrilineal kinship system, exogamous marriage between clans, and organizing into settled villages and towns. Southeastern Woodlands societies were usually divided into clans; the most common from pre-contact Hopewellian times into the present include Bear, Beaver, Bird other than a raptor, Canine (e.g. Wolf), Elk, Feline (e.g. Panther), Fox, Raccoon, and Raptor. They observe strict incest taboos, including taboos against marriage within a clan. In the past, they frequently allowed polygamy to chiefs and other men who could support multiple wives. They held puberty rites for both boys and girls.\n\nSoutheastern peoples also traditionally shared similar religious beliefs, based on animism. They used fish poison, and practiced purification ceremonies among their religious rituals, as well as the Green Corn Ceremony. Medicine people are important spiritual healers.\n\nMany southeastern peoples engaged in mound building to create sacred or acknowledged ritual sites. Many of the religious beliefs of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex or the Southern Cult, were also shared by the Northeastern Woodlands tribes, probably spread through the dominance of the Mississippian culture in the 10th century.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2260425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260425", "title": "502nd Infantry Regiment (United States)", "text": "502nd Infantry Regiment (United States)\n\nThe 502nd Infantry Regiment (502nd IR), previously titled the 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment (502nd PIR), is an airborne infantry regiment of the United States Army. The regiment was established shortly after the American entry into World War II, and was assigned as a regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, \"The Screaming Eagles\", one of the most decorated formations of the U.S. Army. The regiment saw substantial action in the European Theater of World War II and was inactivated in 1945, shortly after the end of the war. Reactivating in a new form in 1956, the 502d Infantry has served in the Vietnam War, the first Gulf War, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, and Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq. Since 1974, the regiment has been classified as an Air Assault unit. Currently, its 1st and 2d battalions are active. Both battalions are assigned to the 2d Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault).\n\nThe original 48-man Parachute Test Platoon was formed at Fort Benning, Georgia. Four parachute infantry battalions were planned to follow.\n\nOn 1 July 1941, the 502d Parachute Infantry Battalion was activated at Fort Benning under the command of Major George P. Howell, under orders dated 15 April. He'd been the former executive officer of the 501st Parachute Infantry Battalion (not to be confused with the later 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment). This new unit was initially composed of two skeleton companies sliced off from the 501st. The unit lacked everything from parachutes to small arms. This kept the 502d understrength until more men could be recruited at Fort Jackson, South Carolina and Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Plans for the next two battalions (503d and 504th) had to be put on hold because there were no more men or equipment on hand at Benning.\n\nThe Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 and the German declaration of war on the U.S. on 11 December 1941, prompted an acceleration of every kind of military planning. On 30 January 1942, realizing a battalion was too small to conduct offensive operations and survive to fight again, the War Department hurriedly authorized the activation of four Army parachute regiments. A month later, on 2 March 1942, the 502d Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR) was activated from the assets of the 502nd Battalion. Each company (A, B and C) provided the nucleus of the three battalions. The 502nd became the only one of the four parachute infantry battalions to have an unbroken tie to the later regiment of the same number. Staying in command, Howell was promoted to Colonel but left that same month to command Benning's parachute school. He passed command to his executive officer, Lieutenant colonel George Van Horn Moseley, Jr. who would command for the next two years.\n\nIn August 1942, following the activation of the 101st Airborne Division at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana, the 502nd PIR moved from Fort Benning to join the rest of the division at Fort Bragg. The integration of a selected parachute unit into a partly draftee division that for the most part was not jump qualified led to problems, some of which could only be solved through training. Throughout the rest of 1942 and into 1943 the 502nd took part in the 101st's grueling training program, which consisted of individual, unit, and combined division training. During March 1943 the 502nd took part in a series of wargames across the Carolinas and then across Tennessee later that year.\n\nOn 4 September 1943 men of the 502nd boarded the SS \"Strathnaver\" bound for their new home in England. After breakdowns and saltwater contamination of the ship's drinking water, the regiment was stuck in St. John's, Newfoundland. On 4 October the SS \"John Ericsson\" picked them up, and they arrived in Liverpool on 18 October. They settled into quarters in the small villages of Chilton Foliat and Denford in Berkshire, England which would be their home for the next seven months. The Regiment's troopers continued their rigorous training which included hikes and daily close combat exercises. Instructions were given on a wide variety of items ranging from first aid, map reading, chemical warfare and demolitions. Other training was held on the use of German weapons, since enemy dead were considered a source of emergency resupply. Company and battalion size parachute drops were rehearsed heavily. The largest of these rehearsals was a division combat drop in May, Exercise Eagle. It didn't go well with H Company dropped short of the objective. High winds and rough landings injured over 400 paratroopers across the division, many of whom were then not available for the Normandy jump three weeks later.\n\nFlying out of RAF Membury and RAF Greenham Common in the first wave to depart, the 502nd PIR headed for Drop Zone A. The unit's mission was to secure two northern causeways leading inland from Utah Beach and destroy a German battery of 122 mm howitzers near Saint-Martin-de-Varreville. Captain Frank Lillyman, officer in charge of the regiment's pathfinder platoon, was the first American jumper of the night - celebrated as the first American paratrooper to drop behind German lines in the Allied invasion of Normandy. He hit the ground at 00:15 on the 6th, his habitual jump cigar clenched in his teeth. The pathfinders soon learned they'd been misdropped, so they made no effort to get the rest of the regiment lost with them and left their radios and beacons turned off. Coming in unguided, the formations of C-47's broke up in a combination of low clouds and heavy enemy anti-aircraft fire. Some planeloads, including two sticks of A Company, were dropped over the English Channel and drowned. Consequently, most of Colonel Moseley's troops landed way off their designated DZs, up to away. Colonel Moseley badly broke his leg and had to relinquish command to his executive officer, LTC John H. \"Iron Mike\" Michaelis.\n\n1st Battalion, under LTC Patrick F. Cassidy, was the only battalion of the entire 101st to come down on target, and that through blind luck. 1st Battalion secured Saint Martin-de-Varreville by 06:30, sent a patrol under SSG Harrison C. Summers to seize a German barracks at Mésières, \"WXYZ\" objective and set up a thin line of defense from Foucarville to Beuzeville. 2nd Battalion, under LTC Steve Chappuis, moved inland from its drop zones. Meanwhile, the 3rd Battalion led by LTC Robert G. Cole was responsible for securing the two causeways coming inland from Utah Beach. Undaunted by the confusion, LTC Cole gradually collected whatever men he could find both from his unit and anyone else's (at one point including 1LT Dick Winters of E/506th). Cole eventually achieved his objective in time to secure the beach landing of the 4th Infantry Division.\nLTC Cole was in the lead five days later as the 502nd was part of the division's effort to capture the town of Carentan. Moving the 3rd Battalion down the causeway toward the Ingouf farm under heavy German fire, LTC Cole ordered a bayonet charge. Capturing the objective, LTC Cole was nominated for the Medal of Honor. His executive officer, Major John Stopka, was nominated for the Distinguished Service Cross. On 29 June the 101st was relieved from VIII Corps and sent to Cherbourg to relieve the 4th Infantry Division elements who had the German garrison pinned down in that seaport city. The 502nd returned to England shortly thereafter for refitting, earning a Presidential Unit Citation for the campaign.\nThe summer of refitting was punctuated by several planned combat jumps to capture objectives in front of the advancing Allied ground forces, yet every jump was cancelled as the tanks got there first.\n\nOperation Market Garden was a British plan that would be the first major daylight jump attempted since the German invasion of Crete four years before. Set for 17 September 1944, the airborne troops were to seize roads, bridges and the key communication cities of Eindhoven, Nijmegen and Arnhem, thus cutting the Netherlands in half and clearing a corridor for British armoured and motorized columns all the way to the German border.\n\nThe 101st mission was to secure the of highway stretching from Eindhoven north to Veghel. Under the command of Colonel Michaelis, the unit was to land in the Netherlands on DZ C, seize the small highway bridge over the Dommel river north of St. Oedenrode and the railroad and road bridges over the Wilhelmina Canal at Best. The 502nd was also given the mission of guarding DZs B & C for the subsequent glider landings. Shortly after 13:15 on the afternoon of 17 September 1944, after an uneventful daylight drop, the men of the 502nd gathered up and headed for their objectives. 1st Battalion went north to capture the little town of Sint-Oedenrode. 2nd Battalion secured the glider LZ. 3rd Battalion sent patrols through the Zonsche forest, trying to move toward the town of Best and the bridge. German resistance was tough in the vicinity of Best, but the 3rd Battalion spearheaded by Captain Robert Jones' H Company fought their way to within of the bridge before the Germans blew it up. In fierce fighting around the bridge, Private first class Joe E. Mann, already hit twice, was killed when he threw himself on a German grenade to save the other soldiers in his foxhole. That same day, LTC Cole was shot and killed elsewhere in the Zonsche Forest. Cole died before formally receiving his Medal of Honor for the Carentan charge, while Private Mann would receive it posthumously. They were the only two members of the 101st to earn the nation's highest honor during World War II.\n\nOn 26 September, a German artillery shell hit a tree by the 502nd's Regimental CP. LTC Michaelis, 1st Battalion's LTC Cassidy, the regimental S2 and S3, the division G2 and G3, and the commander of the supporting 377th Artillery Battalion were all hit. Without a regimental XO, and with Cassidy and Cole both down, 2nd Battalion commander Steve Chappuis took command of the regiment. After securing their hard-won objectives, the men of the 502nd moved north with the rest of the 101st to take hold of defensive positions on 'The Island', southwest of Arnhem. It was here that the 101st would fight some of its toughest battles during its time in the Netherlands. Eventually they were withdrawn to Camp Mourmelon, France for rest and refit.\n\nJust after dawn on 16 December 1944, the Germans launched a major offensive west through the Ardennes Forest. Their goal was the port city of Antwerp where they hoped to choke off the Allied supply lines. Almost the only American theater reserve were the two refitting airborne divisions. The 101st was ordered to the vitally important town of Bastogne, Belgium, the central road junction in the Ardennes. The 101st was jammed into trucks for an overnight rush to Bastogne on 18 December. They were soon surrounded along with elements of several armored and artillery outfits. The 502nd held positions on the north and northwest portion of the surrounded city. In an attack that took place on Christmas morning in the village of Hemroulle, numerous German tanks penetrated the line. Simultaneously farther north strong German infantry elements infiltrated the town of Champs. Two of the German tanks which drove north from Hemroulle attempted to bypass the regimental CP at the Rolle Chateau, only to be tracked down by bazooka and grenade-toting paratroops. Finally, on 26 December, the 4th Armored Division of Patton's Third Army broke through the encirclement to reinforce the defense.\n\nOn 14 January 1945, the 3rd Battalion lost another commander. LTC John Stopka and some of his troopers were advancing through the forest near Michamps, Belgium, along an elevated rail line when enemy tanks began advancing along the other side. Someone called in for air support and the planes strafed too close to the friendly positions, killing Stopka and 30 other paratroopers. Command of the 3rd Battalion was given to Major Cecil L. Simmons.\n\nThe 101st Airborne held a line along the Moder River for over a month as part of the Seventh Army. On 23 February, the 101st were relieved and returned to Mourmelon, France. They began a refit period while the leadership began planning for potential combat jumps in and around Berlin to end the war. There was also a ceremony in which General Eisenhower awarded the entire division the Presidential Unit Citation for gallantry in action during the fighting for Bastogne. This was the first time an entire division had been so honored. This was added to the one awarded to the 502nd for Normandy.\n\nAs the war in Europe was nearing its end, the 502nd moved to the Ruhr Pocket on 2 April to help in mop-up operations. Here the 502nd went on the line facing the Rhine River south of Düsseldorf. On 4 and 5 May, the 502nd followed the 506th into the securing of Hitler's private residence in the town of Berchtesgaden, home to many high-ranking Nazi Party officials and German military officers.\n\nThe 502nd spent the summer of 1945 on occupation duty near Mittersill, Austria. Returning to France in September, the soldiers continued waiting for transport to the U.S. for the promised victory parade down New York's Fifth Avenue. However the reduced peacetime Army only had room for one of the European Theater's four airborne divisions, and the 82nd was senior in terms of combat experience. The 101st Airborne Division was inactivated 30 November 1945 at Auxerre, France. Much of the unit property and records were burned, only nine boxes of the 502d's records making it to the States for eventual inclusion in the National Archives. For comparison, the 506th sent sixteen boxes.\n\nWhile on inactive status, the regiment was redesignated on 18 June 1948 as the 502d Airborne Infantry Regiment and allotted to the Regular Army on 25 June that same year. It was activated on 6 July 1948 at Camp Breckinridge, Kentucky, as a training unit that was airborne in name only. It was inactivated on 1 April 1949. Shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War, it was again activated on 25 August 1950, again as a training unit at Camp Breckinridge, and then inactivated on 1 December 1953 at Camp Breckinridge following the truce declared in July. It was activated yet again as a training unit on 15 May 1954 at Fort Jackson, South Carolina.\n\nOn 21 September 1956, the Army established the 101st again as a training unit by transferring its colors, then at a training command at Fort Jackson, SC, to Fort Campbell, KY. The departure of the 11th Airborne Division for NATO duty in West Germany meant that the Army needed another rapidly deployable unit to face Cold War contingencies. The reactivated 101st was formed using the assets of the 187th and 508th Airborne RCTs, plus volunteers from the inactivating 6th Infantry Division run through parachute school either at Fort Campbell or Fort Benning.\n\nThe division of 1956 was much different from the wartime pattern. There were tight military budgets for conventional forces in the Nuclear Age since the predominant belief was that battlefield nuclear weapons would be used early and often. This in turn made riflemen obsolete. This, combined with the fact the new 101st would be built from scratch, made the division a test of what was called a Pentomic, for \"pentagonal atomic\" division. The division was made up of five \"battle groups\", each one consisting of five companies (1 headquarters company, four rifle companies) plus a heavy mortar section. There was even a nuclear-armed rocket battery in Division Artillery. But there was only room for one \"battle group\" of each of the 101st's old regiments (327th, 501st, 502nd, and 506th, with the 187th coming in from the 11th). The lineage of the 502d was revived with the activation on 25 April 1957 of HHC, 1st Airborne Battle Group, 502d Infantry (bearing a lineage going back to Company A of the original 502nd PIB) as a unit within the 101st. As the rest of the Army converted to the Pentomic structure, the 2d Airborne Battle Group, 502nd Infantry was activated on 1 March 1957 in West Germany by reflagging existing elements of the 11th Airborne Division. Perpetuating the lineage of Company B, 502d PIB and thus the World War II 2d Battalion, it was inactivated on 1 July 1958 when the 11th itself was inactivated. Its personnel and equipment were reflagged to other unit designations under the 24th Infantry Division, which retained a partial Airborne capability with two battle groups (1-187th and 1-503d) before they rotated back to the United States to become part of the 82d Airborne Division. Their departure from the 24th was concurrent with the arrival of two non-airborne battle groups arriving from the United States.\n\nBy 1964, the Army had reached the conclusion that the Pentomic arrangement didn't work, and the 101st returned to a more recognizable structure. The Department of the Army announced that brigades would be the building blocks of the new style divisions. Consisting of three battalions with wartime attachments, they were similar to what used to be called a regiment or regimental combat team; however, the 502d found itself split. The HHC 2d Battalion (with the lineage of Co B/502PIR) was in 1st Brigade with two battalions of the 327th, and HHC 1st Battalion (with the lineage of Co A/502PIR) was in 2d Brigade with two battalions of the 501st.\n\nIn April 1965 the 1st Brigade was deployed to South Vietnam to relieve the 173rd Airborne Brigade. Instead as the war expanded, both units stayed. The 2d Battalion, 502d Infantry quickly made a name for itself under the command of LTC Henry E. Emerson.\n\nIn June 1966 during Operation Hawthorne, Company C, 2d Battalion, 502d Infantry was conducting a mission to locate elements of the North Vietnamese People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 24th Regiment. Charlie Company made contact with what was estimated to be a battalion-sized enemy element. Under heavy enemy fire and unable to maneuver in any direction, CPT Bill Carpenter called for air strikes on top of his position in an attempt to force the enemy to withdraw. \"We might as well take some of them with us\", he radioed to the 2nd Battalion command post. The Napalm attack injured seven of Carpenter's men, but the PAVN ceased fire long enough to allow Company C to consolidate, reorganize and establish a position from which to defend and begin evacuation of wounded personnel. For their extraordinary heroism in destroying the PAVN and in evacuating the mass casualties, both Carpenter and 1st SGT Walter Sabalauski received the Distinguished Service Cross. The Fort Campbell Air Assault School was named in Sabalauski's honor. Another member of 2-502d was CPT Tommy Taylor, son of General Maxwell Taylor, who wanted to serve with his father's wartime command.\n\nIn 1967, Operation Eagle Thrust moved the rest of the division to South Vietnam aboard chartered airliners as part of the American buildup. At that time it was the largest single airlift in US military history. Unfortunately the orders for it found the remainder of the division on Fort Campbell not ready to enter the fight. It was a skeletal formation that had been drained of personnel to support the war effort. To bring it up to full strength prior to deployment, it was necessary to fill it with non-airborne-qualified personnel from other units in the Third Army area. The division effectively ceased being an airborne unit, although the official transformation to the 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile) did not take place until mid-1968.\n\nThe 2d Battalion served almost seven years in South Vietnam. Fighting scattered actions under two different brigade headquarters from the Mekong River delta in the south to the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone up north, they earned 27 campaign streamers, six American and eight Vietnamese unit citations between them, including two Presidential Unit Citations earned by 2nd Battalion for An Khe and Dak To. The 1st Battalion fought in the A Shau Valley. Three 2d Battalion soldiers earned the Medal of Honor. Specialist Dale E. Wayrynen, Private First Class Milton A. Lee and Corporal Frank R. Fratellenico all have Fort Campbell landmarks named for them. In December 1971, after having drawn down in country, the 101st began returning home to Fort Campbell.\n\nIn order to move home in a more convenient fashion, the 101st largely drew down in Vietnam, and it was a skeletal unit that came back. On 10 February 1972, the 1st Battalion, 502d Infantry returned to Fort Campbell with one officer, one warrant officer, and ten enlisted men, down from its wartime fill of nearly nine hundred officers and men. Most serviceable equipment had been left behind for the South Vietnamese military.\n\nThe division was officially welcomed home on 6 April 1972, and began the task of rebuilding itself. Division commander Major General John Cushman, a former 2d Brigade commander, stated with the end of the Vietnam War and of the draft, that the 101st was to be reconfigured as a combat-ready, all-volunteer force by May 1973.\n\nIf the 502d was going to rebuild, it would need to get out and train. In opportunistic fashion, much of that training came from other units' funding. In the summer of 1972, 1-502 departed to West Point, New York to support summer field training at the United States Military Academy. The next two summers found it New York bound again, supporting the Army Reserve's 187th Infantry Brigade (Separate).\n\nThis is not to say all was well on Fort Campbell in those years. There were equipment shortages, racial tensions, drug use, and drunken brawls. But the units built and grew. In 1980 1-502 formed the centerpiece of \"Task Force Strike\" and deployed to Egypt for Operation Operation BRIGHT STAR. This was a joint training exercise with Egyptian forces, culminating in a desert live fire exercise supported by low-level B-52 Stratofortress strikes; these aircraft having flown a long-duration mission from the continental US. Task Force Strike was the first American ground force in the region since World War II.\n\nIn February 1982, Task Force 1-502 deployed to Panama support of Operation \"Kindle Liberty\", intended to demonstrate U.S. ability and resolve to defend the Panama Canal in the light of spreading pro-Soviet/Cuban influence in Nicaragua and Central America. The task force deployed on C-5 Galaxy aircraft, 24 flights being enough to move 1-502 Infantry, a battery of 105mm howitzers, a platoon of engineers, and an aviation package of UH-60 Black Hawk transport helicopters and AH-1S Cobra gunships to Howard Air Force Base in Panama. This marked the first deployment of the UH-60 helicopter to Panama.\n\nBased on its previous Egypt and Panama deployment experiences, 1-502 deployed to Egypt again in September 1982. This time its mission was to enforce the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel by serving on the Sinai Peninsula as part of the Multinational Force and Observers.\n\nMay 1984 saw the first major realignment of the division since before Vietnam. The brigades regimentally aligned, with both 1st and 2d Battalions now coming under 2d Brigade, and 3d Battalion reactivating from the assets and personnel of 1-506 Infantry to complete the set. For the first time since Auxerre, France in 1945, the regiment's three battalions were together under one headquarters, even if the Army wouldn't truly consider it a regiment. At the division reunion that year, long-retired First Sergeant Dovholuk presented the blue silk World War II colors back to 2d Brigade commander John Herrling. They are still on display in the 2d Brigade headquarters.\n\nConcurrent with the reflagging within the 101st, the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions, 502d Infantry were activated within the Berlin Brigade by reflagging the existing 2d, 3d and 4th Battalions, 6th Infantry. This was part of a wider Army plan to regimentally pair units based within the United States with those stationed overseas for battalion rotational purposes. These three battalions, perpetuating the lineages of World War II Companies D, E and F, 502PIR, were neither airborne nor air assault. The rotation plan was found to be unworkable and was quietly abandoned.\n\nOn 12 December 1985, a chartered airliner carrying 248 members of Task Force 3-502 crashed and exploded after takeoff at Gander, Newfoundland, Canada. Mostly from HHC and Company A, they were on the final leg returning from six months of peacekeeping duty in the Sinai Peninsula between Egypt and Israel. The official Canadian government report said it was ice buildup on the wings that caused the crash, but other investigators have pointed to signs of an explosion and suggested everything from terrorism to smuggled souvenir ordnance instead. Whatever the reason, it is the deadliest single day in division history by some counts, outdoing both 6 June 1944 and Vietnam's \"Hamburger Hill\" battle. LTC Marvin Jeffcoat became the third of the five officers who had commanded 3-502 to that point to die in command. President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan attended an emotional memorial service on Fort Campbell. Memorials for the fallen were subsequently constructed at Gander Lake, Newfoundland, Canada; near Fort Campbell in Hopkinsville, Kentucky; and on post between Screaming Eagle and Normandy Boulevards.\n\nThe \"Strike\" Brigade moved to Saudi Arabia as part of Operation Desert Shield in late summer 1990 to deter a possible Iraqi invasion. During Operation Desert Storm, the 2d Brigade and 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) cut the enemy's lines of communications, struck deep into the country, threatened a strike against the capital, and shut off any escape. On 25 February 1991, the \"Strike\" Brigade participated in the largest helicopter air assault in military history to establish FOB Cobra and FOB Viper with the final objective to cut off Iraqi forces on Highway 8 from moving west and supplies from Basrah. The brigade redeployed to Fort Campbell in March 1991.\n\nOn July 3, 1991, soldiers of HHC and Company B, 6th Battalion, 502d Infantry (and elements of the 42d Engineer Co & FIST) became Task Force 6-502d, making the first deployment of the brigade's history, by deploying for Operation Provide Comfort II in Turkey. Upon return to Berlin, in October 1991, these soldiers were authorized wear of the Berlin Brigade SSI as a combat patch on their right shoulders, the only soldiers authorized do so.\n\nOn July 6, 1993 soldiers of Company C, 6th Battalion, 502d Infantry landed at Petrovec Airport close to Skopje, Macedonia. It was the first US Army unit to deploy to Macedonia and it was the last deployment of the BBDE outside of Berlin. The reinforced company (additional elements came from HHC Berlin Brigade; 42d Engineer Company; Company D (TOW), 6th Bn, 502d Infantry; FIST, 5th Bn, 502d Infantry; and the 287th Military Police Company) from the Berlin Brigade were to take part in the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) mission to monitor the Macedonia-Serb border. The operation was named \"Able Sentry.\" Lt. Col. Walter Holton was the commander of the 315-member task force in Macedonia. It was under operational control of the UNPROFOR commander, Danish Brig. Gen. F. Saermark Thomsen. The Task Force returned to Berlin in January 1994.\n\nThe 5th and 6th battalions drew down and were inactivated in Berlin on 4 July 1994. In December 1990, 4-502d, the first unit of Berlin Brigade to inactivate, moved to Fort Campbell and cased its colors, the personnel moving to other assignments in the division.\n\nIn 1994, 502d soldiers from the 101st deployed to Panama in support of Operation Safe Passage the repatriation of Cuban refugees.\nIn 1999, 3-502d Infantry deployed to Panama in support of JOTC (Jungle Operations Training Center), the infantry augmentation of U.S. forces during the draw down of United States military in Panama.\n\nIn 1999, Company A, 2-502d Infantry deployed to Bosnia-Herzegovina as the Quick Reaction Force (QRF) for Stabilization Force 6 (SFOR6). This deployment fell under the command of the United Nations. The deployment did not conclude until 2000, after the new year's millennium celebration.\n\nIn 2001, 2-502d deployed to Kosovo and elements of 3-502d to the Republic of Macedonia, where they participated in a rotation as part of NATO's Kosovo Force.\n\nThe 502d was called on again in 2003, when it headed the 101st's combat air assault into Iraq. Colonel Joe Anderson's brigade was selected to provide light infantry support to the 3d Infantry Division during the 2003 Iraq War. It returned a year later having fought in the key battles of Najaf, south Al Hillah, Karbala, and Mosul. It also completed the two longest air assaults in division history. While deployed, the 502d was instrumental in rebuilding the city of Mosul, Iraq. They formed a city council and held the first free elections in the country since the fall of the regime. Over the subsequent nine months, the regiment rebuilt the city's hospitals, schools and water system. It also built a regional police force that became the model for the rest of the country. Under the watchful eye of the soldiers from the 502d, former Iraqi military personnel were paid for their service and the new Iraqi Dinar was introduced. Above all, the regiment fostered a secure environment that allowed the citizens of Mosul to live in a free and safe city which became a beacon of hope throughout Iraq. Upon their redeployment to Fort Campbell, the 502d underwent transformation as part of the 2d Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division.\nThe newly formed 2d Brigade Combat Team deployed again to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in fall 2005 for 15 months. While deployed, the soldiers of the 502d continued to improve security conditions within their assigned area of operations and began to train Iraqi security forces within Southern Baghdad and the infamous area of Mahamudiyah, Lutafiyah and Yusifiyah. During their deployment, the Strike Brigade lost 67 soldiers with numerous wounded in combat operations in an area where over 4,200 IEDs were found during their tenure. In March 2006, five soldiers participated in the rape and murder of 14-year-old Abeer Qasim Hamza. Strike soldiers once again deployed for 13 months in late 2007 north of Baghdad where they continued to train Iraqi security forces while fighting the Jaish al Mahdi paramilitary force.\n\nOn 31 August 2016, Clarksville Online reported U.S. soldiers from the 1st Battalion, 502d Infantry Regiment, Task Force Strike, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), took charge of a Ranger training program for qualified volunteers from Iraqi security forces at Camp Taji, Iraq. The Ranger training program, led by Company A, 1-502d, is designed to lay the foundation for an elite Iraqi unit.\n\nIn 2010, 2d Brigade deployed to Kandahar Province, Afghanistan as part of the troop surge into the most unsecured areas. \"Strike\" Brigade successfully flushed out the Taliban fighters from the birthplace of the Taliban. Strike Brigade continued operations that had become the first American battalion to occupy areas within Zhari District of Kandhar Province. After relieving the 5th BCT, 2d Infantry Division in place, the Strike Brigade breached further into the \"green zone,\" a fertile area that borders the northern bank of the Arghandab river, and held a strategic area of land Taliban fighters had been using for years.\n\nOne of the major operations during Strike Brigade's tour was Operation Dragon Strike. Operation Dragon Strike officially launched on 15 September 2010. After a couple of months of fighting, Operation Dragon Strike ended in a coalition victory. The mission of Operation Dragon Strike was to drive insurgent forces from the Arghandab district of the Kandahar Province.\n\nFollowing the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the regiment was transformed and refitted along with the rest of the division. At that time, the 3d Battalion was again inactivated and the 1st Squadron, 75th Cavalry activated in its place as the Strike Brigade's RSTA (Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition) Squadron. It also adopted 1st Battalion, 320th FAR (Field Artillery Regiment), the 526th BSB (Brigade Support Battalion, consisting of a number of logistical and maintenance personnel), and the 2d BCT's Special Troops Battalion. The STB, formed in part from personnel and equipment of the inactivating 311th Military Intelligence Battalion, was activated with four companies consisting of engineers, communications and signal, military intelligence, military police, and several other specialized and low-density military occupational specialties. These units were again deployed to Iraq in support of the 4th Infantry Division in September 2005.\n\nThe 3d Battalion received the Army's Valorous Unit Award and Meritorious Unit Citation for the battles in Karbala against Saddam's insurgents attacking 3rd ID's supply lines.\n\n\n1st Battalion concurrently consolidated with the 502d Parachute Battalion (constituted 14 March 1941 in the Army of the United States and activated 1 July 1941 at Fort Benning, Georgia) and consolidated unit designated as the 1st Battalion, 502d Parachute Infantry Regiment.\n\nRegiment (less 1st Battalion) activated 2 March 1942 at Fort Benning, Georgia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2260429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260429", "title": "Tail", "text": "Tail\n\nThe tail is the section at the rear end of certain kinds of animals’ bodies; in general, the term refers to a distinct, flexible appendage to the torso. It is the part of the body that corresponds roughly to the sacrum and coccyx in mammals, reptiles, and birds. While tails are primarily a feature of vertebrates, some invertebrates including scorpions and springtails, as well as snails and slugs, have tail-like appendages that are sometimes referred to as tails. Tailed objects are sometimes referred to as \"caudate\" and the part of the body associated with or proximal to the tail are given the adjective \"caudal\".\n\nBased on this definition, the tail of a snake would typically consist of a small portion of the rear end of its body, where none of its vital organs are being housed, and begin at its last rib, contrary to the commonly held assumption that the tail begins precisely at the middle of the snake's body due to its linear shape.\n\nAnimal tails are used in a variety of ways. They provide a source of locomotion for fish and some other forms of marine life. Many land animals use their tails to brush away flies and other biting insects. Some species, including cats and kangaroos, use their tails for balance; and some, such as New World monkeys and opossums, have what are known as prehensile tails, which are adapted to allow them to grasp tree branches.\n\nTails are also used for social signaling. Some deer species flash the white underside of their tails to warn other nearby deer of possible danger, beavers slap the water with their tails to indicate danger, and canids (including domestic dogs) indicate emotions through the positioning and movement of their tails. Some species' tails are armored, and some, such as those of scorpions, contain venom.\n\nSome species of lizard can detach (\"cast\") their tails from their bodies. This can help them to escape predators, which are either distracted by the wriggling, detached tail or left with only the tail while the lizard flees. Tails cast in this manner generally grow back over time, though the replacement is typically darker in colour than the original. Various species of rat demonstrate a similar function with their tails, known as degloving, in which the outer layer is shed in order for the animal to escape from a predator. \n\nMost birds' tails end in long feathers called rectrices. These feathers are used as a rudder, helping the bird steer and maneuver in flight; they also help the bird to balance while it is perched. In some species—such as birds of paradise, lyrebirds, and most notably peafowl—modified tail feathers play an important role in courtship displays. The extra-stiff tail feathers of other species, including woodpeckers and woodcreepers, allow them to brace themselves firmly against tree trunks.\n\nThe tails of grazing animals, such as horses, are used both to sweep away insects and positioned or moved in ways that indicate the animal's physical or emotional state.\n\nHuman embryos have a tail that measures about one-sixth of the size of the embryo itself. As the embryo develops into a fetus, the tail is absorbed by the growing body. Infrequently, a child is born with a \"soft tail\", which contains no vertebrae, but only blood vessels, muscles, and nerves, but this is regarded as an abnormality rather than a vestigial true tail, even when such an appendage is located where the tail would be expected. Fewer than 40 cases have been reported of infants with \"true tails\" containing the caudal vertebrae, a result of atavism.\n\nHumans have a \"tail bone\" (the coccyx) attached to the pelvis; it comprises fused vertebrae, usually four, at the bottom of the vertebral column. It does not normally protrude externally - humans are an \"acaudal\"\nspecies.\n\n"}

It sells and distributes its main product, Sussex Best Bitter, to other pubs and social clubs in South East England. John Harvey established the Bridge Wharf Brewery on its present site by the River Ouse, overlooking Cliffe Bridge.\n\nIn 1880, part of the original Georgian brewery was rebuilt: the Tower and Brew House visible for example from Cliffe Bridge. This is an example of a country brewery with a facade in a rustic Neo-Gothic design of the Victorian era, a listed building at Grade II*. Behind it stands another half: the Georgian fermenting room, cellars and Vat House. The fermenting room, Brew House and cellars have not changed in layout and dimensions, although reinforced and their contents have evolved. The Vat House was converted and expanded into the modern bottling process.\n\nThe current yeast strain was introduced in 1957 from the John Smith's Brewery.\n\nIn 1984, a second brewing line was completed doubling production capacity from 25,000 to 50,000 barrels a year. The building for this plant has been added in front of the Tower in a similar Gothic style, such as an arched ironwork window.\n\nIn 2016, after many years of keg beers being absent from the brewery's portfolio, a limited range of them was introduced. Also in 2016 the company made its first entry into the canned beer market with a range that included its flagship Sussex Best Bitter. Harvey's is an independent family company: Harvey & Son (Lewes) Ltd. The seventh generation of John Harvey's descendants are among directors.\n\nAlthough Harvey's Brewery had traditionally omitted an apostrophe from its name and products, the newly designed pump badge (since 2010) for its Sussex Best Bitter included one. Subsequently, individual beer badging omitted or included the apostrophe seemingly randomly. In August 2016 Harvey's launched new branding across the whole company. It was launched at the CAMRA Great British Beer Festival in that month and specifically ensured that an apostrophe was always included in every instance of the brewery's name on point of sale material, websites, glassware, advertising copy and paperwork.\n\nAt the same time a company strapline was introduced ‘We wunt be druv’ meaning 'we won't be driven'.\n\nHarvey's produces cask-conditioned, kegged, canned and bottled ales. In the case of cask-conditioned and bottled ales there is a range which is always available (\"all-year\"), and then a selection of \"seasonal\" ales.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, Harvey's Sussex Best Bitter won the Best Bitter category at the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) Great British Beer Festival.\n\n\n"}

The disease left him with an atrophied leg and a permanent limp on his walk, which prevented him from playing. However, he did not give up his dream of being part of the footballing world, and decided to learn other aspects of the game. Autuori worked as a physical coach for clubs such as Portuguesa (RJ), and Nacional in Portugal. At Nacional, Paulo Autuori was promoted to manager of the main team, and has enjoyed a successful coaching career ever since.\n\nAutuori graduated in Physical Education at Universidade Castelo Branco; and attended a Sport Admninstration course at PUC-RJ and a Soccer Coach Course at UERJ.\n\nAutuori coached some teams from Portugal: Nacional, Vitória de Guimarães, Marítimo and Benfica; from Brazil: Portuguesa (RJ), Botafogo, Cruzeiro, Flamengo, Internacional, Santos and São Paulo; and from Peru: Alianza Lima, Sporting Cristal and the Peru national team.\n\nTowards the end of April 2005, just before quitting Peru, he was hired by São Paulo FC to replace Émerson Leão, who had just gone to Japan. In that year, he won the Copa Libertadores 2005 and the 2005 FIFA Club World Championship.\n\nOn 29 December 2005, he resigned São Paulo to sign with Kashima Antlers, from Japan. At the end of 2006 he announced his new club as Cruzeiro E.C., this was his third time at the club.\n\nOn 12 November 2009, Paulo Autuori has decided to leave Gremio, after have reached an agreement with the club. Gremio decided to let free the manager, because they can't win the championship title.\n\nOn 21 November 2009, Qatar League side Al Rayyan have replaced Brazilian coach Marcus Paqueta with his compatriot Paulo Autuori. The latter only left the club six months ago to join Gremio in his homeland, but has made a swift return after signing a three-year contract.\n\nPaulo Autuori became the coach of the Qatar Olympic team on 27 August 2011. He replaced Frenchman Bernard Simondi. His first assignment was to lead the team during the 2012 London Olympics Qualification stage.\n\nOn 20 February 2012 The 55-year-old Brazilian became the fourth manager of the Qatar national team in the previous year, but is full of confidence they can progress towards the 2014 World Cup.\n\nAfter being dismissed from Vasco da Gama, on 10 July 2013, Autuori signed with São Paulo. In 2005, as coach for \"Tricolor\", he won two important titles: Copa Libertadores 2005 and 2005 FIFA Club World Championship. This time, however, Autuori is arriving in São Paulo to solve a crisis, the club losing its five last games.\n\nOn the following day, Autuori was introduced as the new coach despite the preference of many fans, who wanted Muricy Ramalho's return. The new coach of São Paulo said that, if the choice were his he would have signed Ramalho who Autuori considered a \"winner\". Autuori affirmed that he felt \"a lot of satisfaction to return to this glorious institution, with big aims.\" The former \"vascaíno\" coach said that \"I have not come to be loved; I have come to be champion.\"\n\nEven in a middle of a crisis, Autuori has improved the ambient in São Paulo FC, a bad one in comparison to period that Ney Franco was the coach. The Lúcio's removal from staff, according some people of club, was essential for this.\n\nOn 9 September 2013, Autuori was dismissed by directors of São Paulo FC after the 2–0 loss against Coritiba FC, a result that kept the club in relegation zone of Brazilian League. In a report from official site of club, there is a praising about his work. His substitute is Muricy Ramalho, that, ironically, also replaced him in 2006 in club from Morumbi Stadium.\n\nOn 5 June 2018 Autuori was announced as the new Director of football in the Bulgarian champion Ludogorets Razgrad, but on the next day he was presented as the new manager of the team, since Dimitar Dimitrov wanted to leave the club. He stepped down from his position in October 2018, citing personal reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This fact may be used to find the volume of the vault using Cavalieri's principle. Finding the volume in this way is often an exercise for first-year calculus students, and was solved long ago by Archimedes in Greece and Zu Chongzhi in China; for more, see Steinmetz solid.\n\nAssuming the intersecting barrel-vaults are semi-cylindrical, the volume of the vault is formula_1 where s is the length of the side of the square base.\n\n\n"}

However, a restrictor in the space, a \"spacer plate\", and aerodynamic disadvantages in the trucks compensate for the lack of a restrictor plate.\n\nGrant Enfinger is the 2020 winner of the event.\n\nThe inaugural running of the race in 2000 featured one of the most horrific wrecks in NASCAR history. Just past the halfway point of the race, Kurt Busch's truck made contact with that of Rob Morgan, turning him into Geoff Bodine's truck, sending Bodine careening airborne into the wall and catch fence just past the start-finish line. Bodine's truck burst into flames and flipped at least 10 times before coming to a stop toward Turn 1, causing a major wreck involving 13 trucks. Despite having serious injuries, Bodine survived and raced again later that year in May at Richmond. Although this race was largely overshadowed by this wreck, it was truly exciting as Mike Wallace made the last lap pass on Andy Houston for the inaugural victory.\n\nIn 2001, Joe Ruttman was the first driver to win the race from the pole position.

A signature element of Von Maur stores is a live pianist who performs for customers during normal business hours.\n\nIn 1872, German immigrant J. H. C. Petersen and his three sons opened a store in a storefront in downtown Davenport, Iowa. The store eventually expanded and moved into their flagship store, the Redstone Building at 2nd and Main Streets in Davenport. In 1916, J.H.C. Petersen's son, William D. Petersen, sold the family store to a partnership of R.H. Harned, C.J. von Maur, and Cable von Maur.\n\nC.J. von Maur, who came from Austria, established the Boston Store (later renamed Harned & Von Maur) in downtown Davenport in 1887. Despite the common ownership, Petersen's and Harned & Von Maur continued to operate as separate stores for twelve years, even after C.J. von Maur died in 1926. On May 7, 1928, Harned & Von Maur merged with the Petersen's store in what is now known as the Redstone Building. The store was renamed Petersen Harned Von Maur, which was often shortened to \"Petersen's\". The von Maur family assumed complete ownership of the store after R.H. Harned died in 1937.\n\nIn the company's centennial year of 1972, Petersen Harned Von Maur opened its first branch store at Duck Creek Plaza in Bettendorf, Iowa. Another branch store opened at SouthPark Mall in Moline, Illinois, in 1974. In 1976, Petersen's opened its first store outside the Quad Cities area at Valley West Mall in West Des Moines, Iowa. The company continued to open new stores in shopping malls throughout Iowa and Illinois during the late 1970s and 1980s; along the way it acquired two former Killian's department stores in Cedar Rapids and Iowa City, Iowa, in 1981. As the company shifted its focus to malls, the Petersen Harned Von Maur flagship store in downtown Davenport closed in 1986. The Redstone Building is now home to the River Music Experience.\n\nPetersen Harned Von Maur shortened its name to Von Maur in 1989 to reflect the von Maur family's management of the company. One year later, it moved its corporate headquarters and executive offices from the Redstone Building to a building on Brady Street (near the interchange with Interstate 80) in Davenport. The company distributes all of its merchandise from this building using its own fleet of semi-trucks. It also has its own credit union and credit department as well as a print shop.\n\nIn 1989, Von Maur purchased stores vacated by Carson Pirie Scott at Hickory Point Mall in Forsyth and College Hills Mall in Normal.\n\nVon Maur successfully entered the Chicago market in 1994 with a flagship store at Yorktown Center in Lombard, Illinois. Von Maur currently has 6 stores in Illinois, more than any other state. From there, the company expanded its geographic reach into Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, and Nebraska during the late 1990s and early 2000s while closing stores in Bettendorf, Iowa and Muscatine, Iowa, during this period. In 2004 Von Maur expanded into Michigan by taking over two mall locations of the defunct Jacobson's chain (The Briarwood Mall in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Laurel Park Place in Livonia, Michigan). In late 2005 it opened a store at Polaris Fashion Place in Columbus, Ohio, the 23rd store in the chain. On January 31, 2007, Von Maur closed its store at Westdale Mall in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which brought the store count down to 22.\n\nOn December 5, 2007, the Westroads Mall shooting occurred at a Von Maur location in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nOn Saturday, September 13, 2008, Von Maur opened its 23rd store, a store in Phase II of The Greene, a project of Steiner Associates in Dayton, OH.\n\nThe 24th store at the Corbin Park Lifestyle Center in Overland Park, Kansas had its soft opening on Monday, November 3, 2008 and the grand opening on Saturday, November 8, 2008.\n\nToday, the privately held company remains under the leadership of the Von Maur family, including co-chairmen Charles R. von Maur and Richard B. von Maur, as well as president James D. von Maur. Von Maur offers free gift wrapping year-round as well as free shipping year-round. Von Maur caters to the typical middle-class consumer. In the past five years, the chain has expanded out of its Midwestern home territory to open stores in Georgia, Alabama, New York, and Oklahoma.\n\nSeptember 18, 2010, Von Maur opened their location in the Meadows at Lake St. Louis shopping center.\n\nOn November 11, 2010, Von Maur announced the chain would open its first store in the Southeast in the Atlanta suburb of Alpharetta. The regional flagship store would convert a former location previously occupied by Lord & Taylor, then Belk, at the North Point Mall into a much larger anchor. The store opened in early November 2011.\n\nIn March 2011, it was reported Von Maur would enter the Wisconsin market with a store in the Milwaukee area at a new lifestyle shopping center in Brookfield named The Corners. The proposed store was to have been combined with a three story parking structure and had been predicted to open in the Fall of 2014, but numerous project delays occurred. Von Maur's 32nd location, it opened on April 8, 2017.\n\nIn September 2011, Von Maur announced that it would open a store in Coralville, Iowa at Iowa River Landing, replacing the chain's Iowa City store, previously located at Sycamore Mall.\n\nIn November 2011, it was announced that Von Maur would enter New York State with its first store at Eastview Mall, outside Rochester, replacing a Bon-Ton store. Von Maur's first northeast location opened on October 26, 2013.\nVon Maur announced in early January 2012 they would be opening their second Atlanta area store at the soon-to-be shuttered Bloomingdale's location at Perimeter Mall in north suburban Dunwoody, while the company's president said that he would like to have four or five stores in the market during this time. The three-story, store opened on November 10, 2012.\n\nOn November 2, 2013, the chain opened its first store in Alabama, at the Riverchase Galleria in the Birmingham suburb of Hoover. The store is located in the space first occupied by Macy's, then Proffitt's, and later Belk.\n\nOn February 27, 2013, it was announced that Von Maur would be opening a new location in Oklahoma City as the fourth anchor store at Quail Springs Mall, replacing Sears. The facility opened on October 18, 2014 and marked the 30th location for Von Maur.\n\nIn October 2014, Nordstrom announced that they would close their store at the Mall of Georgia in Buford, Georgia. Von Maur opened their third Georgia store (after North Point Mall and Perimeter Mall).\n\nIn March 2016, the company announced that it would open a second store in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. The two-story, 140,000-square foot store at Rosedale Center opened on October 13, 2018, joining the existing store at Eden Prairie Center.\n\nIn February 2017, It was announced that the longstanding Sears store at Woodland Mall in the Grand Rapids suburb of Kentwood, Michigan, would close and will reopen as Von Maur in 2019 along with other additions to the mall.\n\nIn February 2018, the company announced it would open a store at the Jordan Creek Town Center in West Des Moines, Iowa. That store will open in 2022.\n\n"}
{"id": "2260459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260459", "title": "Photo album", "text": "Photo album\n\nA photographic album, or photo album, is a series of photographic prints collected by an individual person or family in the form of a book. Some book-form photo albums have compartments which the photos may be slipped into; other albums have heavy paper with an abrasive surface covered with clear plastic sheets, on which surface photos can be put. Older style albums often were simply books of heavy paper on which photos could be glued to or attached to with adhesive corners or pages.\n\nThe oldest photograph albums in the collection of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. are from the 1850s. Early family photo albums were often displayed in the home. \"Families who could only afford a couple of pictures would put them into an album, to which other family members would add theirs.\"\n\nCoffee table books get their name from the intended purpose of being placed on a coffee table for the entertainment of guests. Coffee table books are photo-books, and come in various sizes from very small to very large. They are printed books with soft and thin pages like normal books. A coffee table book is typically larger and is bound in a hard cover, whereas a smaller photo book is normally bound in a soft cover. The print quality of photo books varies from photographic paper prints to inkjet prints on normal paper.\n\nDigital photo books have digitally printed pages as opposed to albums that consist of traditional photos. Both flush mount albums as well as coffee table books are printed digitally. The photos of flush mount albums are printed on photographic paper, which is comparable to the quality of traditionally developed photos. Coffee table books, on the other hand, are printed with inkjet on ordinary paper and are therefore of a lower quality. Digital printing gives the album designer a vast number of design possibilities, for example magazine-style or montage albums are only possible with digital printing.\n\nDigital photo books are increasingly popular because they allow anyone with a digital camera to create coffee table books of their photos. Also, it is often considered easier to print photos onto pages directly, rather than position and secure individual prints onto the pages of a traditional album. Aesthetically, digital photo books seem neater and more professional than albums. This has led to their growing popularity among both professional and amateur photographers. Digital photo book printing companies have used the internet to make designing and producing photo books very easy for the general consumer.\n\nFlush mount albums have hard covers with thick, unbending pages. They consist of photographic prints that were dry-mounted on cardboard. The covers are mostly made of leather, leatherette or glass. The photos lie completely flat and extend across the whole page. Flush mount albums are usually designed in magazine-style. They are most often used for special occasions such as weddings and anniversaries due to the fact that they are produced at a higher quality and are more expensive to produce than coffee table books.\n\nThe term magazine-style refers to the design style inspired by fashion magazines, but the style can differ greatly between albums dependent on the designer. The layout is usually referred to as digital montage, hence the alternative name montage albums. The layout is designed on the computer, utilizing custom- or template- generated images.\n\nStorybook albums narrate a story, like the story of a wedding day or a vacation from beginning to end. If they are digitally printed the designer can use images as well as text, graphics and color for the narration of the story.\n\nScrapbooking albums describe a history, like the history of a particular field or a digital console from beginning to end or present day. If they are digitally printed the designer can use images as well as text, graphics and color for the sequential theme of the history.\n\nHomemade decorative albums can easily be made at home. The items needed to make this type of album may already be a part of the home office supplies. Items consist of: binder folders, clear sheet protectors or picture sleeves, fabric of choice, and a hot glue gun. Some may choose to use stuffing to give a fluff to the album. This type of album is simple to make; and allows the crafter to explore their creative side, while adding a personal touch.\n\nMatted albums are albums with recessed frames, in which each photo is hand-mounted. The photos are digitally or traditionally printed and can also be changed also after completion of the album.\n\nSelf-mount albums are the most common form of traditional album. They contain manually mounted digital or traditional photos that can be rearranged. Self-mount albums are easy to produce and can be used for any occasion.\n\nThere are many software programs available to organize images in folders or albums. These programs generally allow for sorting and ordering of different images, tagging the images, and viewing them in slideshows or printing them. These programs commonly allow the user to perform basic edits such as cropping, red-eye removal, and some basic \"one touch\" enhancements for color and lighting. Some online albums have introduced techniques of separating special effects from the original picture so that the picture is not edited - effects are applied when displayed without destroying the original picture.\n\nThere are also many other, lay-up software programs available for making photobooks. These are generally offered free as a design tool but require the user to pay for the production of their printed photobook. These programs are generally not specifically designed for photo editing, more for the express purpose of creating a book that will eventually be printed and bound into a photo-book. These programs are generally provided by the company that print and bind the photobooks. Therefore, the home printing function is generally not available.\n\n"}

As vizier, Hemiunu was one of the most important members of the court and responsible for all the royal works. His tomb lies close to Khufu's pyramid. As vizier he succeeded his father, Nefermaat, and his uncle, Kanefer.\n\nHemiunu was a son of prince Nefermaat and his wife, Itet. He is a grandson of Sneferu and a relative of Khufu, the Old Kingdom king. Hemiunu had three sisters and many brothers.\n\nIn his tomb he is described as a hereditary prince, count, sealer of the king of Lower Egypt (\"jrj-pat HAtj-a xtmw-bjtj\"), and on a statue found in his serdab (and now located in Hildesheim), Hemiunu is given the titles: king's son of his body, chief justice, and vizier, greatest of the five of the House of Thoth (\"sA nswt n XT=f tAjtj sAb TAtj wr djw pr-DHwtj\").\n\nHemiunu's tomb lies close to Khufu's pyramid and contains reliefs of his image. Some stones of his badly damaged mastaba () are marked with dates referring to Khufu's reign. His statue can be found at the Pelizaeus Museum, Hildesheim, Germany. This statue is scheduled to be loaned for the opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum (as of August 2016 the Egyptian Museum has not yet been opened, and the statue is still on display in Hildesheim). \n\nHis statue was found in the walled-up serdab of Hemiunu's mastaba by archaeologist Hermann Junker in March 1912. Ancient looters had ransacked the mastaba in their quest for valuable items and the wall to the serdab had a child-sized hole cut into it. The robber forcefully gouged out the statue's precious inlaid eyes and gold castings, in the process the right arm was broken and the head severed. The head has been restored, using a as a guide for the nose's profile.\n\nThe seated statue is well-preserved, apart from the damage mentioned above, and is notable for its realism, not found in ancient Egyptian art depicting royal figures. Hemiunu's features are only lightly stylized and clearly based on his appearance. He is depicted as obese, with notable accumulation of fat in the pectoral region. This contrasts with the more idealized representation of male subjects in royal portraiture in this and most succeeding periods of Ancient Egyptian art.\n\n"}

Robert is also famous for addressing his listeners as \"citizens,\" as well as saying \"Great day in the morning!\"\n\nRobert also holds significant stature in the American rock music industry, where he is held in high esteem by many rock musicians and groups, many of whom have granted Robert rare interviews and appeared in person on his program.\n\nPierre Robert (pronounced \"row-BEAR\") began his radio career at 94.9 KSAN-FM, one of the country's first progressive rock stations, in his hometown of San Francisco. When KSAN changed its format to an Urban Country & Western style in the early 1980s Robert assumed the on-air name \"Will Robertson\" for a brief period of time because he was morally opposed to the new format.\n\nNot long after, Robert joined a friend destined for school and moved to Philadelphia in Robert's 1970 Volkswagen van (named Minerva) with bald tires. He sent 93.3 WMMR a demo tape but was initially turned down. Pierre took a job at Essene (a health food store and vegetarian restaurant) until a fateful day at a palm reader's table on South Street, where he was told \"you're gonna get a letter very soon\". This letter was waiting for him at home and was from Joe Bonnadonna (then WMMR's station manager) indicating there was an opening.

Spiritualist churches are now found around the world, but are most common in English-speaking countries, while in Latin America, where a form of spiritualism called spiritism is more popular, meetings are held in spiritist centres, most of which are non-profit organizations rather than ecclesiastical bodies.\n\nThe origin of mediumship is usually linked to the Fox sisters at Hydesville, Arcadia, New York in 1848, but some believers date the unofficial beginning of modern American Spiritualism to the Shakers and similar religious groups. By 1853 the movement had reached San Francisco and London, and by 1860 was worldwide. The Fox family remained very active in Spiritualism for many years. Other notable Spiritualists of that era were Mercy Cadwallader, who became a sort of missionary for the movement, and Emma Hardinge Britten, who wrote for the first Spiritualist newspaper in Britain, \"The Yorkshire Spiritual Telegraph\".\n\nBy the 1870s there were numerous Spiritualist societies and churches throughout the US and Britain, but there was little in the way of national organization of mediums in Britain or the United States although some regions of Britain had organized \"Federations\" that might have up to thirty circles of similar beliefs. In 1891 the National Federation of Spiritualists (NFS) came into existence and grew quite large before its name change to the Spiritualists' National Union (SNU) in 1902.\n\nBritish spiritualists of this time were often adherents of the temperance and anti-capital punishment lobbies, often held radical political views and were frequently vegetarians. Some were active in the advocacy of women's rights and female suffrage, and a minority espoused Free Love: the popular perception of Spiritualists was often of radicals in the Victorian period.\n\n\"Two Worlds\" was the major British magazine of spiritualism and had a fairly large circulation, and it advertised the existence of local circles. D.D. Home one of the most renowned mediums of his era, did much to make spiritualism fashionable among the aristocracy by his high-profile activities. Trance mediumship flourished and table turning was a popular craze, reputedly even reaching Buckingham Palace.\n\nBy 1924 there were 309 Spiritualist churches affiliated to the SNU or one of the many other organisations. In 1932, a new magazine, \"Psychic News\", joined \"Two Worlds\" on the newsstands of Britain and carried news of the doings in local Spiritualist churches.\n\nFrom 1920 to 1938 there was the British College of Psychic Studies (1920 to 1947) led by Mr. and Mrs. Mackenzie in London, but more successful was the Arthur Findlay College at Stansted which continues to today.\n\nIn 1957 Spiritualist churches in Britain divided between the Spiritualists' National Union, influenced by Arthur Findlay's beliefs and holding spiritualism to be a religion, and the circles of Christian Spiritualism, who hold Spiritualism to be a denomination of Christianity. Spiritualists National Union churches form the large majority and are affiliated to Spiritualist Association of Great Britain (SAGB), which is not a church per se, but rather an organization for mediums. The SNU also has some member churches in other English-speaking countries. Christian Spiritualist churches are mainly affiliated to The Greater World Christian Spiritualist Association (GWCSA).\n\nOther Spiritualist groups in the UK include the White Eagle Lodge, founded by the medium Grace Cooke, the Institute of Spiritualist Mediums and the Noah's Ark Society (the NAS) whose focus was physical mediumship and the support and development of physical mediums. (The NAS was dissolved ca. 2005/2006 by its founder, the late George Cranley.)\n\nThere are Spiritualist churches in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, The Republic of South Africa, Sweden and groups in many countries including Japan, the Scandinavian countries, Korea, Italy, Germany, Austria, Hungary, The Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Portugal and Iceland. Many such groups and also individuals, are members of the International Spiritualist Federation (ISF) which was founded in Belgium in 1923 and is an umbrella organization for all spiritualists. The ISF holds congresses every two years in different parts of the world.\n\nIn Australia, the Associated Christian Spiritual Churches of Australia (ACSCOA) and the Victorian Spiritualists' Union (VSU) co-exist alongside independent churches, and Canada has the Spiritualist Church of Canada (SCC) founded in 1974, along with a number of independent churches.\n\nAmerican spiritualism has long been more individualistic than its British counterpart. Many North America Spiritualist churches are denominationally affiliated with the National Spiritualist Association of Churches (NSAC), The National Spiritual Alliance (TNSA), or the United Spiritualist Church Association (USCA), but almost as many are independent churches with no national affiliation.\n\nSpiritualist churches generally have, in addition to the church proper, an educational wing called a lyceum (the Greek word for \"place of conversation\"). These Spiritualist lyceums function as a support system for the teaching of Spiritualist history and doctrine outside of the liturgical services, and enable the booking of guest lecturers and visiting mediums.\n\nA unique aspect of American Spiritualism, which sets it apart from British church tradition, was the nineteenth century development and institutionalization of Spiritualist Camps, organized by urban Spiritualist churches. These rural retreats, located in picturesque natural settings throughout the United States, allow Spiritualist families to spend their summer vacations boating, hiking, attending Spiritualist lectures, taking development classes in mediumship, and receiving messages from guest mediums. Among the best-known of the Spiritualist camps are Lily Dale Assembly in Lily Dale, New York, Camp Cassadaga in Cassadaga, Florida, On-I-Set-Wigwam Spiritualist Camp in Massachusetts, Camp Chesterfield in Indiana, Sunset Spiritualist Camp in Kansas, and Wonewoc Spiritualist Camp in Wisconsin.\n\nIn 1922, during a time of rising Jim Crow laws and segregationism, the NSAC expelled its African American members. The Black Spiritualists then formed a national organization called the Colored Spiritualist Association of Churches (CSAC), which included churches in Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, New York City, and elsewhere. The CSAC eventually fractured over leadership and doctrinal issues, and the historically African American Spiritualist churches, now loosely referred to as the spiritual church movement, currently includes a variety of denominations such as the African Cultural Nationalist Universal Hagar's Spiritual Church and the Protestant-Christian-oriented Pentecostal Spiritual Assemblies of Christ - International and Metropolitan Spiritual Churches of Christ. The Spiritual Churches of New Orleans are a diverse group of denominations that have schismed from the denomination founded by the Wisconsin-born Mother Leafy Anderson in the early twentieth century. Their theology was grounded on a very original Black feminism, and particularly on the Gospel of John, 4 (the encounter of Jesus and the Samaritan woman).\n\nMost spiritual church movement churches incorporate theological Spiritualism, including the utilization of traditional \"Spirit Guides\" in worship services, with a mixture of Protestant and Catholic iconography. The names of individual churches in these diverse denominations tend to indicate the denominational Christian orientation of their founders or their congregations. Some, such as Divine Israel Spiritual Church (in New Orleans), recall typical Black Baptist churches, others, like Divine Harmony Spiritual Church (in Miami), have names evocative of the early twentieth century New Thought movement, and some, such as Infant of Prague Spiritual Church (in New Orleans), feature Catholic names and include statuary of Catholic saints on their altars. Unlike the NSAC Spiritualist churches, the denominations of the spiritual church movement generally do not maintain Spiritualist Camps or a Lyceum system of extra-liturgical education.\n\nSpiritualist churches are places of worship for the practitioners of Spiritualism. The Spiritualist service is usually conducted by a medium. Generally, there is an opening prayer, an address, the singing of hymns, and finally a demonstration of mediumship. Healing circles may also be part of the formal proceedings.\n\nSome Spiritualist churches maintain that Spiritualism is a religion in its own right, and has no relationship to any other religion.\n\nOther Spiritualist churches draw inspiration from Christianity. African American Spiritualist churches tend to encourage ecstatic worship styles derived from African-American Protestant Baptist and Pentecostal practices. The churches that directly descend from the teachings of Leafy Anderson are also distinguished by special services and hymns that honor the spirit of the Native American war chief Black Hawk, who lived in Illinois and Wisconsin (Anderson's home state).\n\nA third group of Spiritualist churches propose the idea of the Universe as the creator, and does not necessarily follow any specific religious doctrine or dogma.\n\nSpiritualists believe that when people die physically an aspect of the personality or mind survives this and continues to exist on a spirit plane, sometimes referred to as the spirit world. Spiritualists use the word \"Spirit\" as a plural which describes all minds and entities who have entered into the spirit world. The purpose of the medium is to provide some evidence that a human has survived by describing the person to their surviving relatives. The degree of accuracy with which the deceased are described goes some way to convincing the living relatives and friends that the medium has some contact with the spirit.\n\nSpiritualists describe this as \"survival evidence'\".\n\nThere have been a number of famous practitioners of spirit communication connected to Spiritualist churches. One of the principal advocates of Spiritualism was the 20th century British writer Arthur Findlay. Findlay was a magistrate, farmer and businessman who left his mansion house as place for the study and advancement of psychic science. This has now become a psychic college in Stansted, England and is run by the SNU.\n\nMediums develop their ability by sitting regularly in \"development circles\" with other student psychics. Meditation usually plays a large role in Spiritualist practice. Meditation is used to calm the \"voices\" of modern, hectic life so that the practitioner can better hear his or her guide. Meditation often includes the breathing practices of Buddhist meditation (ānāpānasati) and may also include the idea of chakras. The Spiritualist may also focus on the tenets of their chosen religion to help them attain a higher existence. These may include standard prayers (Hail Mary, Shema Yisrael or salat etc.), focusing on the name of God (Jesus, YHWH or Allah etc.) or other aspects of a holy nature. Like most meditation techniques, imaging (intensely imagining a place or situation) is common. There are specific imagings used to \"meet\" one's guide, connect with those who have died, receive protection or support from God or simply calming the mind.\n\nThrough engaging their intuition, they attempt to contact with the spirits of the dead. This is known as \"opening up\". In Britain especially, such mediums are trained to produce clear evidence that the spirit contacted is the person they claim it to be before going on to give any \"message\" from the spirit. Such evidence can be details of where they lived, including addresses sometimes, particulars of illnesses suffered and notable events in their lives, often known only to the person in the congregation being given the information.\n\nSpiritualist healing, as practiced in some Spiritualist churches during formal liturgical services, is a form of mediumship which involves a technique of directing healing energy to the patient from a higher source. The healer uses his or her hands to effect repair of damaged or diseased tissue and it is claimed all or part of the patient's good health is sometimes restored.\n\n\n"}

From 1967 to 1972 it was also carried on BBC Radio 1. It was a request programme designed to link families at home in the UK with British Forces serving in West Germany or elsewhere overseas. The programme was a big success with listeners.\n\nIt had the memorable signature tune \"With a Song in My Heart\" (original played by Andre Kostelanetz and his Orchestra) and was presented by a variety of well-known radio personalities, including Cliff Michelmore, Jean Metcalfe, Bill Crozier in Cologne, Michael Aspel, Judith Chalmers and Sarah Kennedy. The final UK presenter was Jean Challis, although both Pete Murray and Ed Stewart continued to use the title for segments of their shows, often linking up with places such as Australia and New Zealand, for another couple of years during the 1980s; during this time, the song \"Hurry Home\" by Wavelength became popular with the families of troops returning from the Falklands War.\n\nWhen the programme expanded, it encompassed far-flung corners of the Commonwealth with, amongst others, Bill Paull being the link man in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, June Armstrong-Wright in Hong Kong, Ross Symonds in Australia, Don Durbridge in Gibraltar and Marama Martin in New Zealand.\n"}
{"id": "2260508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260508", "title": "NASCAR Racing Experience 300", "text": "NASCAR Racing Experience 300\n\nThe NASCAR Racing Experience 300 is the first race of the NASCAR Xfinity Series season, held at Daytona International Speedway. It is held the day before the Daytona 500, and is considered the most prestigious event of the Xfinity Series. Until 2002, it was the only event of the Xfinity Series to be annually held at Daytona International Speedway. Noah Gragson won the most recent race, in 2020.\n\nThe race originates from races held at the Daytona Beach Road Course during the 1948 NASCAR Modified series season, the first sanctioned races held by the organization. Between 1950 and 1958, the race was held as part of the Modified/Sportsman Series, at the Daytona Beach Road Course. It was held the Friday or Saturday before the track's Grand National Series race.\n\nIn 1956–1959, a race in the short-lived NASCAR Convertible Division was also held.\n\nThe race moved to the new 2.5-mile Daytona International Speedway for 1959. It was scheduled the day before the Daytona 500, and ran a distance of either 200 or 250 miles. In 1966, the race became known as the Permatex 300, making it only the second race on the NASCAR schedule to be named for a corporate sponsor (the Motor Trend 500 at Riverside being the first). In 1968 the Permatex 300 was shifted from the Modifieds division to the newly organized NASCAR Late Model Sportsman Division. In 1982, the Late Model Sportsman Division was reorganized into the modern day NASCAR Xfinity Series, and the race was sponsored by Goody's for several years.\n\nIn the 1970s and early 1980s, the race was often ridiculed and exploited by local media for its frequent crashes and massive pileups. Several major accidents and fires over the years were blamed on the low level of experience by several of the drivers, and the older equipment used. The level of prestige held by the event, along with the relatively large purses, attracted numerous independent and one-off entries, contributing to the inexperience of drivers in the field. \n\nBy the time the race had become part of a NASCAR touring series race, NASCAR tightened driver eligibility requirements, and the number of incidents has drastically been reduced. Under current NASCAR rules, drivers must be cleared to race at Daytona and Talladega (added to the second tier series in 1992), requiring enough experience at intermediate tracks to be cleared by NASCAR to participate at Daytona. Drivers who intend to run the 300 or the Truck Series NextEra Energy 250 will enter other lower-tier shorter support races, whether it was the former Dash Series race (which ended after 2004 -- it used less powerful cars) or in recent years, the ARCA race the week prior to gain NASCAR clearance, especially if a driver has turned 18 after the preceding October Talladega Camping World Truck Series race. NASCAR will also require the driver first test in the January ARCA test at Daytona if they will turn 18 prior to the ARCA race before they are allowed to participate in the ARCA race. (Drivers must be 18 to participate in any NASCAR national series race on a track 1.366 miles or longer; 16 and 17 year old drivers may enter a Truck race on shorter tracks.)\n\nInclement weather also plagued many early runnings.\n\nThe 1960 race is notable for having the largest pileup in NASCAR history. On the first lap, 37 cars crashed in turn four (out of a starting field of 68).\n\nIn 1981 and 2004, the race started on Saturday, but was halted by rain, and finished Monday, the day after the Daytona 500. The 1969 race was red flagged three times for rain and also saw the fatal crash involving Don MacTavish, which his whole front of the car ripped off.\n\nThe 1979 running was shortened by rain and won by Darrell Waltrip. A brutal crash erupted off Turn Two where fire exploded from the Preacher Cox Mercury of Joe Frasson; driver Don Williams was gravely injured in the crash and would die ten years later from the incident.\n\nThe 2013 race featured two large accidents. With five laps remaining, Michael Annett and Austin Dillon collided and a multi-car crash erupted in the first turn. The race was halted as a red flag was given to clean up the debris. Annett was hospitalized overnight after sustaining bruises on his chest, but was released the following day in time for the Daytona 500, but was ruled out for the following race at Phoenix because of a sternum injury. Following the red flag the race had two laps remaining. Regan Smith and Brad Keselowski moved into the lead on the final lap, but off the fourth turn, Keselowski turned Smith into the wall head on, causing the field to pile in. Kyle Larson had the most significant impact, as his No.32 Chevrolet flew into the tri-oval catch fence, causing its nose to snag a crossover gate, which tore open. The force of the collision dug the engine in, ripping it out of the car. The car's entire front half disintegrated and one front wheel lodged onto the engine and another flew approximately ten rows into the grandstand, injuring 30 spectators (two in critical condition). A total of twelve cars were involved in the crash, but all were unharmed. The two spectators that were seriously injured by the debris from Larson's crash were treated at the nearby Halifax Medical Center and were later released.\n\nIn 2015, two cautions in the final forty laps were caused by separate collisions that included eleven cars. In the first collision, Regan Smith's car flipped over once in the tri-oval, while in the second collision, Kyle Busch collided into a concrete wall head on, suffering a fracture in his leg and foot. As a result of his injuries, Busch was forced to miss the first 11 races of the Sprint Cup Series season however he would still manage to win the season championship.\n\nThe 2018 race produced the closest finish in any of NASCAR's top three series, when Tyler Reddick edged Elliott Sadler by 0.0004 seconds, making it the closest finish in NASCAR history. Since NASCAR scoring and timing does not measure beyond thousands of a second, the margin of victory was officially listed as 0.000 seconds (with video review which declared Reddick the winner by less than three inches). Analysis after the race by NASCAR timing and scoring officials placed Reddick's margin of victory at 0.0004 seconds.\n\nSince its inception, due to its prestige and prominent position on the Speedweeks calendar, the race has long attracted Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series regulars. Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series regulars have dominated the race since 1981, winning all but nine runnings. Notable Cup regulars who have won the race multiple times include Dale Earnhardt (7 wins), Tony Stewart (7), Darrell Waltrip (5), and Dale Earnhardt Jr. (3).\n\nOn four occasions, the driver of the race has gone on to win the Daytona 500, which is typically run on the following day: Bobby Allison (1988), Darrell Waltrip (1989), Dale Earnhardt Jr. (2004), Kevin Harvick (2007).\n\nIn the early-1990s, ESPN began airing the race same-day tape delay. From 1997 to 2000, the race was shown live on CBS, which also held broadcast rights to the Daytona 500 at the time. From 2001 to 2006, the live television rights to the race were held by Fox (odd years) and NBC/TNT (even years). The race was shown on ESPN or ESPN2 and was the only event of Speedweeks not shown on the Fox family of networks between 2007 and 2014. Fox Sports 1 started broadcasting the race in 2015 under the current NASCAR television contract.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2260539", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260539", "title": "Ross Andru", "text": "Ross Andru\n\nRoss Andru (; born Rossolav Andruskevich; June 15, 1927 – November 9, 1993) was an American comics artist and editor. He is best known for his work on \"The Amazing Spider-Man\", \"Wonder Woman\", \"The Flash\", and \"The Metal Men,\" and for having co-created the character called The Punisher.\n\nHis most frequent collaborator was inker Mike Esposito, with whom he worked on projects over a span of four decades. The two founded three short-lived comic books companies: Mr. Publications (1951), MikeRoss (1953) and Klevart Enterprises (1970).\n\nAndru was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nRoss Andru was initially raised in Cleveland, Ohio, by Russian émigré parents who had fled the Russian Revolution; according to family lore, Andru's mother was part Polish and part Russian royalty, while his father had played French horn for the Ballets Russes before later doing so for the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra. After moving to New York City, Andru graduated from The High School of Music & Art, then in Harlem, where one of his classmates and friends was future comics artist Mike Esposito, with whom he would collaborate on flip-book animation. Andru served in the U.S. Army, and after being discharged in 1946, found work later that year with an animation studio in Manhattan drawing for Chiclets chewing gum commercials.\n\nAndru's first professional comic book work was for the \"Tarzan\" newspaper strip in 1948. As his longtime art partner Esposito recalled, he and Andru were attending Burne Hogarth's Cartoonists and Illustrators School (later renamed the School of Visual Arts) in 1947 when\nAnother source says penciler Andru first teamed with inker Esposito in 1949 for the publisher Fiction House, but this is unconfirmed at the Grand Comics Database. The team's first confirmed collaboration was on the six-page \"Wylie's Wild Horses\" in Hillman Periodicals' \"Western Fighters\" vol. 2, #12 (Nov. 1950), signaling the start of a four-decade collaboration.\n\nThey quickly founded their own comics-book company, the name of which is variously rendered as MR Publications, after the initial of their first names; Mr. Publications, after the company's sole series, the whimsical adventure comic \"Mister Universe\", which ran five issues (July 1951 – April 1952); or the hybrid MR. Publications. The two also co-founded Mikeross Publications in 1953, which through 1954 produced one issue each of the 3D romance comics \"3-D Love\" and \"3-D Romance\", two issues of the romance comic \"Heart and Soul\", and three issues of the satiric humor comic \"Get Lost\".\n\nBy this time, after having teamed for early work on Key Publications' \"Mister Mystery\" in 1951 and Standard Comics' \"The Unseen\" and \"Joe Yank\" (the latter credited as \"Mikeross\"), the two began a long career as one of DC Comics' primary war story artists, alongside the likes of Joe Kubert, Russ Heath, and Jerry Grandenetti, beginning with a story each in \"All-American Men of War\" #6, \"Our Army at War\" #14, and \"Star Spangled War Stories\" #13 (all Sept. 1953). For those titles as well as \"G.I. Combat\" and \"Our Fighting Forces\", Andru and Esposito drew hundreds of tales of combat under editor and frequent writer Robert Kanigher.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1959, Andru and Esposito shared a studio with fellow comics artists Jack Abel, Art Peddy and Bernard Sachslate, generally credited as either Bernard Sachs or Bernie Sachs.\n\nAndru began a nine-year run on \"Wonder Woman\" starting with issue #98 (May 1958), where he and writer Robert Kanigher reinvented the character, introducing the Silver Age version and her supporting cast. As well, with writer-editor Robert Kanigher, Andru co-created the robot superheroes called The Metal Men in \"Showcase\" #37 (April 1962), going on to draw the first 29 issues of the lighthearted series \"Metal Men\", from 1963 to 1968. Esposito said Kanigher \"left the character design up to Ross and myself, under his supervision, of course.\"\n\nAndru and Kanigher had several other notable collaborations. The \"Gunner and Sarge\" feature introduced in \"All-American Men of War\" #67 (March 1959) was one of the first war comics to feature recurring characters. Andru drew an early appearance of Kanigher's Sgt. Rock character in \"Our Army at War\" #81 (April 1959) With Kanigher, the Andru-Esposito team introduced the non-superpowered adventurers the Suicide Squad in \"The Brave and the Bold\" #25 (Sept. 1959). Another innovation was the melding of war comics with science-fiction in \"The War that Time Forgot\", a feature created by Kanigher and Andru in \"Star Spangled War Stories\" #90 (May 1960). Andru also drew early issues of \"Rip Hunter, Time Master\" in 1961, and the \"Sea Devils\".\n\nIn 1967, Andru left \"Wonder Woman\" to become the penciler on \"The Flash\", with he and inker Esposito drawing the super-speedster superhero's adventures from issue #175–194 (Dec. 1967 – Feb. 1970). Reuniting with Kanigher, Andru co-created the \"Rose & The Thorn\" backup feature in \"Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane\" #105 (Oct. 1970).\n\nA Spider-Man story drawn by Andru in 1968 was originally planned as a fill-in issue of \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" but was published in \"Marvel Super-Heroes\" #14 when regular Spider-Man artist John Romita Sr. recovered more quickly than anticipated from a wrist injury.\n\nFor the black-and-white comics-magazine publisher Skywald in 1971, Andru and Esposito contributed many stories across the line, including to the horror titles \"Nightmare\" and \"Psycho\" and the Western titles \"Wild Western Action\", \"The Bravados\" and \"Butch Cassidy\". With writer Gary Friedrich, they created Skywald's motorcycle-riding superhero \"Hell-Rider\".\n\nAndru and Esposito formed the publishing company Klevart Enterprises in 1970, which two years later published two issues of a humor magazine cover-titled \"Up Your Nose (and Out Your Ear)\". The name, Esposito said, came from an expression used by late-night talk-show host Johnny Carson, \"May the bird of paradise fly up your nose, and out your ear.\" A third issue was written but never printed because of financial problems.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Andru left DC for Marvel Comics. Initially he did short runs on such titles as \"Marvel Feature\" where he launched the superhero team the Defenders in issue #1 (Dec. 1971) and \"Marvel Team-Up\", starting in March 1972, where he drew Spider-Man teaming with other Marvel characters. In 1973, he began his five-year stint as regular penciler on \"The Amazing Spider-Man\", which at that point was Marvel's highest-selling monthly comic. Andru and writer Gerry Conway introduced the Punisher, who would become one of Marvel Comics' most popular characters.\n\nIn 1976, Andru penciled the first large-scale comic book Intercompany crossover, \"Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man\", in a story written by Conway and co-published by Marvel and DC. As one historian wrote, \"The tale was written by Gerry Conway and drawn by Ross Andru, both among the few [at that time] to ever have worked on both Superman and Spider-Man ... The result was a defining moment in Bronze Age of Comic Books.\"\n\nIn 1978, Andru returned to DC to work as an editor, a position he held until 1986. During this period his art appeared mostly on the covers of such titles as \"Action Comics\" and \"Superman\". Working with writer Marv Wolfman and collaborator Mike Esposito, he co-created the syndicated comic strip \"The Unexplained\" in 1979. Throughout the late 1970s and the 1980s, Andru and inker Dick Giordano were DC's primary cover artists, providing cover artwork for the Superman titles as well as covers for many of the other comics in the DC line at that time. In the 1980s, he returned to interior work. He and Roy Thomas collaborated on the \"Superman and His Incredible Fortress of Solitude\" treasury edition published as \"DC Special Series\" #26 (Summer 1981). \"Pandora Pann\" was a proposed series by Andru and writer Len Wein which was to have been published in 1982. But other commitments prevented Wein from writing it, and the project was cancelled. Andru made a brief return to the \"Wonder Woman\" title, drawing six pages in issue #300 (Feb. 1983). The following year, Andru contributed to the 300th issue of \"World's Finest Comics\" as well. A \"New Teen Titans\" drug awareness comic book sponsored by the American Soft Drink Industry and drawn by Andru was published in cooperation with The President's Drug Awareness Campaign in 1983. He was one of the contributors to the \"DC Challenge\" limited series in 1986. Other Andru artwork appeared in \"Vigilante\" (1984) and \"Blue Beetle\" (1987–1988).\n\nAndru's last published work was for Archie Comics' \"Zen, Intergalactic Ninja\" in 1993, on which he was teamed once again with Esposito. Andru lived in the Arverne / Far Rockaway area of Queens, New York. He died of a stroke on November 9, 1993.\n\nPrior to his death, Andru was working with Esposito on a new project to be called \"The Strobe Warrior\" for another independent company founded by Esposito and his assistant Blake Seals. The project fell apart after Andru's passing but was revived years later in song by a band called Fling Lois.\n\nAndru was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nIn \"Ultimate Spider-Man\" issue #87 (Feb. 2006), a \"Ross Andru\" has a cameo as the principal of Peter Parker's high school.\n\nFrequent collaborator Gerry Conway commented of Ross Andru's work, \"Ross Andru could place a character anywhere he wanted. He had a terrific sense of spatial relations; he could track a battle easily across rooftops, from panel to panel. He drew some great sequences where he maintained the same stationary background, a rooftop or a street, across an entire page, but move the characters from panel to panel. I know there are artists today who do that, but many of today's artists are figure-oriented. Space and context doesn't seem as important to them, whereas it was extremely important to Ross. He used to go around New York City taking pictures of the buildings so he could be accurate about where he put Spider-Man.\"\n\nComics work (interior pencil art) includes:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2260546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260546", "title": "South Pole Telescope", "text": "South Pole Telescope\n\nThe South Pole Telescope (SPT) is a 10-meter (394 in) diameter telescope located at the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station, Antarctica. The telescope is designed for observations in the microwave, millimeter-wave, and submillimeter-wave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, with the particular design goal of measuring the faint, diffuse emission from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The first major survey with the SPT–designed to find distant, massive, clusters of galaxies through their interaction with the CMB, with the goal of constraining the dark energy equation of state–was completed in October 2011. In early 2012, a new camera (SPTpol) was installed on the SPT with even greater sensitivity and the capability to measure the polarization of incoming light. This camera operated from 2012–2016 and was used to make unprecedentedly deep high-resolution maps of hundreds of square degrees of the Southern sky. In 2017, the third-generation camera SPT-3G was installed on the telescope, providing nearly an order-of-magnitude increase in mapping speed over SPTpol.\nThe SPT collaboration is made up of over a dozen (mostly North American) institutions, including the University of Chicago, the University of California, Berkeley, Case Western Reserve University, Harvard/Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, the University of Colorado Boulder, McGill University, The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of California, Davis, University of California, Los Angeles, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Argonne National Laboratory, and the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. It is funded by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy.\n\nThe South Pole region is the premier observing site in the world for millimeter-wavelength observations. The Pole's high altitude (2.8 km/1.7 mi above sea level) means the atmosphere is thin, and the extreme cold keeps the amount of water vapor in the air low. This is particularly important for observing at millimeter wavelengths, where incoming signals can be absorbed by water vapor, and where water vapor emits radiation that can be confused with astronomical signals. Because the sun does not rise and set daily, the atmosphere at the pole is particularly stable. Further, there is no interference from the sun in the millimeter range during the months of polar night.\n\nThe telescope is a 10-meter (394 in) diameter off-axis Gregorian telescope in an altazimuth mount (at the poles, an altazimuth mount is effectively identical to an equatorial mount). It was designed to allow a large field of view (over 1 square degree) while minimizing systematic uncertainties from ground spill-over and scattering off the telescope optics. The surface of the telescope mirror is smooth down to roughly 25 micrometers (one thousandth of an inch), which allows sub-millimeter wavelength observations. A key advantage of the SPT observing strategy is that the entire telescope is scanned, so the beam does not move relative to the telescope mirrors. The fast scanning of the telescope and its large field of view makes SPT efficient at surveying large areas of sky, which is required to achieve the science goals of the SPT cluster survey and CMB polarization measurements.\n\nThe first camera installed on the SPT contained a 960-element bolometer array of superconducting transition edge sensors (TES), which made it one of the largest TES bolometer arrays ever built. The focal plane for this camera (referred to as the SPT-SZ camera because it was designed to conduct a survey of galaxy clusters through their Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect signature) was split into six pie-shaped wedges, each with 160 detectors. These wedges observed at three different frequencies: 95 GHz, 150 GHz, and 220 GHz. The modularity of the focal plane allowed it to be broken into many different frequency configurations. For the majority of the life of the camera, the SPT-SZ focal plane had one wedge at 95 GHz, four at 150 GHz, and one at 220 GHz. The SPT-SZ camera was used primarily to conduct a survey of 2500 square degrees of the Southern sky (20h to 7h in right ascension, −65d to −40d declination) to a noise level of roughly 15 micro-Kelvin in a 1-arcminute pixel at 150 GHz.\n\nThe second camera installed on the SPT–also designed with superconducting TES arrays–was even more sensitive than the SPT-SZ camera and, crucially, had the ability to measure the polarization of the incoming light (hence the name SPTpol – South Pole Telescope POLarimeter). The 780 polarization-sensitive pixels (each with two separate TES bolometers, one sensitive to each linear polarization) were divided between observing frequencies of 90 GHz and 150 GHz, and pixels at the two frequencies are designed with different detector architectures. The 150 GHz pixels were corrugated-feedhorn-coupled TES polarimeters fabricated in monolithic arrays at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The 90 GHz pixels were individually packaged dual-polarization absorber-coupled polarimeters developed at Argonne National Laboratory. The 90 GHz pixels were coupled to the telescope optics through individually machined contoured feedhorns.\n\nThe first year of SPTpol observing was used to survey a 100-square-degree field centered at R.A. 23h30m declination −55d. The next four years were primarily spent surveying a 500-square-degree region of which the original 100 square degrees is a subset. These are currently the deepest high-resolution maps of the millimeter-wave sky over more than a few square degrees, with the noise level at 150 GHz around 5 micro-Kelvin-arcminute and square root of two deeper on the 100-square-degree field.\n\nIn January, 2017, the third-generation camera SPT-3G was installed on the SPT. Taking advantage of a combination of improvements to the optical system (providing a significantly larger diffraction-limited field of view) and new detector technology (enabling detectors in multiple observing bands in a single pixel), the SPT-3G detector array contains over ten times more sensors than SPTpol, translating almost directly into a tenfold increase in the speed with which the telescope and camera can map a patch of sky to a given noise level. The camera consists of over 16,000 detectors, split evenly between 90, 150, and 220 GHz. In 2018, a new survey was begun using the SPT-3G camera. This survey will cover 1500 square degrees to a depth of < 3 micro-Kelvin-arcminute at 150 GHz. Significantly, this field overlaps completely with the BICEP Array observing field, enabling joint analyses of SPT and BICEP data which will deliver significantly better constraints on a potential signal from primordial gravitational waves than either instrument can provide alone.\n\nThe first key project for the SPT, completed in October, 2011, was a 2500-square degree survey to search for clusters of galaxies using the Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect, a distortion of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) due to interactions between CMB photons and the Intracluster medium in galaxy clusters. The survey has found hundreds of clusters of galaxies over an extremely wide redshift range.\n\nData from the SPT-SZ survey have also been used to make the most sensitive existing measurements of the CMB power spectrum at angular scales smaller than roughly 5 arcminutes (multipole number larger than 2000)\nand to discover a population of distant, gravitationally lensed dusty, star-forming galaxies.\n\nData from the SPTpol camera was used to make several groundbreaking measurements, including the first detection of the so-called \"B-mode\" or \"curl\" component of the polarized CMB. This B-mode signal is generated at small angular scales by the gravitational lensing of the much larger primordial \"E-mode\" polarization signal (generated by scalar density perturbations at the time the CMB was emitted) and at large angular scales by the interaction of the CMB with a background of gravitational waves produced during the epoch of inflation. Measurements of the large-scale B-mode signal have the potential to constrain the energy scale of inflation, thus probing the physics of the universe at the earliest times and highest energy scales imaginable, but these measurements are limited by contamination from the lensing B modes. Using the larger E-mode component of the polarization and measurements of the CMB lensing potential, an estimate can be made of the lensing B modes and used to clean the large-scale measurements. This B-mode delensing was first demonstrated using SPTpol data. SPTpol data also has been used to make the most precise measurements of the E-mode power spectrum and temperature-E-mode correlation spectrum of the CMB and to make high-signal-to-noise maps of the projected matter density using reconstructions of the CMB lensing potential.\n\nThe 1500-square-degree SPT-3G survey will be used to achieve multiple science goals, including unprecedented constraints on a background of primordial gravitational waves joint analysis of B-mode polarization with the BICEP Array, a unique sample of distant galaxy clusters for cosmological and cluster evolution studies, and constraints on fundamental physics such as the mass of the neutrinos and the existence of light relic particles in the early Universe.\n\nThe Atacama Cosmology Telescope has similar, but complementary, science objectives.\n\nThe South Pole Telescope is funded through the National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs and the U.S. Department of Energy, with additional support from the Kavli Foundation and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.\n\nThe South Pole Telescope achieved first light on February 16, 2007, and began science observations in March 2007. Commissioning observations and an initial small survey were completed in austral winter 2007 with winter-overs Stephen Padin and Zak Staniszewski at its helm. Larger survey fields were completed in 2008 with winter-overs Keith Vanderlinde and Dana Hrubes, and in 2009 with winter-overs Erik Shirokoff and Ross Williamson. The camera was upgraded again in December 2009 for the 2010 observing season, and the full 2500 square-degree SPT-SZ survey was completed in the 2010 and 2011 observing seasons with winter-overs Dana Hrubes and Daniel Luong-Van.\n\nFirst light (the first observation) was achieved with the SPTpol camera on January 27, 2012. During the first season of observations, the winterover crew, Cynthia Chiang and Nicholas Huang, took data on a 100 square degree survey field. 2013 winterovers Dana Hrubes and Jason Gallicchio surveyed a larger field as part of the full SPTpol survey. This larger survey was seen to completion by 2014 winterovers Robert Citron and Nicholas Huang, 2015 winterovers Charlie Sievers and Todd Veach, and 2016 winterovers Christine Corbett Moran and Amy Lowitz. The first winter of SPT-3G observing was overseen by winterovers Daniel Michalik and Andrew Nadolski, with Adam Jones and Joshua Montgomery following in 2018, and Douglas Howe and David Riebel in 2019.\n\n"}

While many characters played important or ongoing roles in the series, many more appeared only in the background. This is a list of characters appearing in the related shows and films. The information is broken down by production and sorted by original air date or release date.\nThe series debuted in 1992 and ran through 1993, and 65 original episodes, under the title \"Batman\". The characters it used consisted of primarily of those drawn from Batman related comic books, though a few were adapted from other DC Comics series or created specifically for the show.\n\n\n\n\n\nReleased theatrically in 1993, \"Batman: Mask of the Phantasm\" continued the style and primary character use from \"Batman: The Animated Series\". It also introduced a character created specifically for the film.\n\n\n\nWhen \"Batman: The Animated Series\" was renewed for an additional 20 episodes, it was also renamed \"The Adventures of Batman & Robin\". These episodes ran from 1994 through 1995 along with reruns of the previous season. Most of the characters used had appeared in the previous season. Most of those that had not were either created specifically for the show or drawn from Batman related comic books.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA feature-length production released directly to video in 1998, \"Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero\" was based on the style of \"Batman: The Animated Series\" and \"The Adventures of Batman & Robin\". The characters used had previously appeared in those two shows.\n\n\n\nThe series debuted in 1996 and ran through 2000, and 54 original episodes, as an extension of the DC animated universe to focus on Superman. The characters it used consisted of primarily of those drawn from Superman related comic books, though characters from a number of other DC Comics series, notably \"The New Gods\", were adapted for the show and a few were created specifically for it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The New Batman Adventures\" debuted in 1997 as a continuation of \"Batman: The Animated Series\" and \"The Adventures of Batman & Robin\". It ran through 1999 with 24 original episodes being aired. Most of the characters that appeared were carried over from the previous series. Additional characters were added, with most of them being drawn from a wider range of DC Comics comic books. The odd character was created specifically for the show or borrowed from its sister show \"\".\n\n\n\nRunning from 1999 through 2001, \"Batman Beyond\" was a spin-off of the other DC animated universe Batman shows set 20 years in the future. Over its run, 52 original episodes aired featuring a handful of characters carried forward from the previous shows. Most of the characters that rounded out the shows were created specifically for the show either wholly or as \"20 year later\" reinterpretations of then current DC Comics characters.\n\n\nIn 2000 \"Gotham Girls\" was launched as a web-toon featuring some of the characters used in \"The New Batman Adventures\" but from the prospective of three of the female villains. The episodes were posted through 2003.\n\nDebuting in 2000 and running through 2004 with 52 original episodes, \"Static Shock\" featured the character Static. Prominent characters in the series were derived from, or very loosely based on, characters created by Milestone Media for comics published through DC Comics. Later episodes bring the series into the DC animated universe with the appearance of characters from the other shows.\n\n\n\nA feature-length production released directly to video in 2000, \"Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker\" was based on the style of \"Batman Beyond\". The characters used had previously appeared in the various shows.\n\n\n\nDebuting in 2001 and running through 2002 with 26 original episodes, \"The Zeta Project\" was a spin-off show from \"Batman Beyond\" and featured mostly original characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebuting in 2001, \"Justice League\" was a continuation of the continuity established in the various Batman and Superman related shows that had aired since 1992. The show ran through 2004, airing 52 original episodes. The characters were drawn from those that had appeared in previous series with additional characters being based on those from DC Comics comic books.\n\n\n\nDuring the series various characters operated as teams in some episodes. In some cases the characters making up the team only appeared as part of that team, so the grouping is noted in the above list. In other cases the characters were not exclusive to the team. The teams that fall into this category are:\n\n\nThe two-part episode \"Legends\" featured pastiches of the Justice Society of America, the Justice Guild of America, and a selection of their villains. The pastiche was used in lieu of the actual characters at the insistence of DC Comics.\n\n\n\nThe two-part episode \"A Better World\" featured a variation of the Crime Syndicate of America called the Justice Lords. The pastiche was used as the writers worked on the episode, replacing the standard Crime Syndicate with a Justice League went fascist.\n\n\n\nA feature-length production released directly to video in 2003, \"Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman\" was based on the style of \"The New Batman Adventures\". With the exception of the titular \"Batwoman\", the characters used had previously appeared in the various shows.\n\n\n\nWhen it was renewed for a third season in 2004, \"Justice League\" was retitled \"Justice League Unlimited\". The show ran through 2006, airing an additional 39 original episodes. Most of the characters were carried over with additional ones being based on those from DC Comics comic books.\n\n\n\nThe antagonists for this series break down into three types based on season and story arc. The first season had a set of episodes linked by an arc focusing on a secret government agency trying to control the Justice League. The second season had a set linked by an arc focusing on an expanded Secret Society. Both seasons also had episodes that did not tie to the arcs. The general antagonists are listed first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe episode \"Double Date\" featured a crime lord as the primary antagonist that was a mix of two DC Comics character. The character was called Steven Mandragora, but did not visually resemble that character. The appearance was based on Tobias Whale.\n\nThe episode \"Ultimatum\" featured the Ultimen, pastiches of characters created specifically for Hana-Barbara's \"Super Friends\" series.\n\nA few characters have been cited by writers and producers as \"off-limits\" at various times during the production of the various shows, though they are allowed to appear in the comics based on the show.\n\nAdam Strange, was originally supposed to appear in \"Hunter's Moon\", but legal rights prevented that from happening. The episode's original title was \"Mystery In Space\", the name of the monthly comic that Adam starred in.\n\nCharacters from Aquaman comics could not appear due to character rights being reserved for a potential live-action TV series. This resulted in Black Manta's being renamed \"Devil Ray\" for the series, the character first appearing in an episode that was originally written to feature Aquaman.\n\nMost characters from the Batman comics due to the \"Bat-Embargo\" that reserved those characters for the new Batman cartoon \"The Batman\" and the new Batman movies. This left only Batman available to be prominently used in \"Justice League\" and \"Justice League Unlimited\".\n\nThis resulted in a partial rewrite of the episode \"Double Date\". Originally, Barbara Gordon was to appear in the episode. The episode would have her getting injured during a case as Batgirl. Since Bruce forbids her from participating she would recreate herself as Oracle, and get in touch with Black Canary and Huntress to finish her case. Neither of them would meet her in person. Due to the Bat Embargo, the story replaced Batgirl with Green Arrow and the Question.\n\nSome non-speaking and quick cameos did make it in to a few episodes though:\n\nKathy Kane the original Silver age Batwoman could not appear as one of the three women to don the costume of Batwoman in the animated movie . According to the featurette included in the DVD release, Alan Burnett explains they had intended to use the name “Kathy Kane” but were asked to change it by DC Comics, thanks to some morally gray actions on the part of the movie Batwoman. This resulted in the character of Kathy Duquesne being created for the show. However, not much later, the a new Batwoman debuted in the new DC continuity being portrayed as a lesbian. The movie however features a near identical character named Sonya Alcana.\n\nBlack Lightning could not appear within the shows due to DC Comics' refusal to pay royalties to his creator, Tony Isabella. This resulted in the character Black Vulcan being created for the show \"Super Friends\". The character Juice is a pastiche of Black Vulcan, and \"\"Soul Power\"\" in Static Shock is also a pastiche Black Lightning.\n\nThis also affected the characters connected to Black Lightning and also created by Isabella. The original idea for \"Double Date\" was for Tobias Whale to be the man who murdered Huntress's parents. He was replaced with a villain called Steven Mandragora, whose last name was later used for the man who arranged their deaths in the comic book \"Huntress: Year One\".\n\nBlue Beetle could not appear as a member of the Justice League due to rights being tied up until 2007 because of his 1940s radio show and 1980s cartoon proposals.\n\nWhen the \"Justice League\" episode, \"Hereafter\" was being produced, Captain Marvel was set to appear as the temporary 7th member. As the rights to the character and the Marvel Family were unavailable to the show, a self-appointed Lobo took the position instead. Later in the episode it was shown that Aquaman had become the 7th member. Captain Marvel later appeared in \"The Clash.\"\n\nFirestorm could not appear as DC Comics did not allow the producers to include the Ronnie Raymond version of Firestorm in the show.\n\nWhile the production team regularly referred to the collection of villains joining forces in the final major arc of \"Justice League Unlimited\" as the \"Legion of Doom\", DC resisted the use of the term within the show itself.\n\nPlastic Man was stated by Dwayne McDuffie to be unusable in the show despite being mentioned as a League member by John Stewart in one episode, but he did not explain why. In the episode \"The Greatest Story Never Told\", Elongated Man complains longly and loudly to Booster Gold about feeling left out in comparison to Plastic Man, given the two's very similar powers (although Plastic Man can change into objects, Elongated Man is also one of the premiere detectives of the DC Universe).\n\nBruce Timm had intended to utilize the Phantom Stranger in the DC animated universe, but was not allowed to do so.\n\nThe Teen Titans and related characters were off-limits due to the eponymous series. Green Arrow's sidekick Speedy appears in the episode \"Patriot Act\" following the finale of Teen Titans.\n\nSandman and other Vertigo characters were said by Bruce Timm in a \"Wizard\" interview to be considered, featuring an appearance of Neil Gaiman's Sandman character, but they weren't sure how to incorporate it into the tone of the show. He went on to say \"But now, it's not even an issue. The whole Vertigo universe is closed off for us.\" In the same interview, Bruce Timm also states that they did attempt to use the Phantom Stranger and the Spectre but were told they could not use those characters.\n\nNeil Gaiman on the subject: \"I always loved the idea of doing a Sandman/Batman Animated cartoon episode, and we were definitely talking about it in '93, after Vertigo came into existence...I'd assumed that they lost interest. But there was definitely some kind of Vertigo/DC divide that came into existence in there somewhere, imposed from DC/Vertigo editorial and above, worried, I was told, that a kid would feel pressured by continuity to pick up a 'For Mature Readers' title and the world would end.\"\n\nA few characters were developed by writers and producers during the production of the various shows; however, they ultimately did not appear in any episodes or films.\n\nWhen \"Justice League\" was pitched to the Kids' WB network, the lineup originally included three young members as proteges for the League. The members would have been Robin, Impulse, and an original character described as a \"teenage female version of Cyborg\" (Cyborgirl). The promo, which is viewable on the fourth disc of the \"Justice League\" Season 1 boxset, is the only appearance of Cyborgirl and Impulse in the DC animated universe.\n\nWhen plans for a \"Justice League\" series were originally in development in the late 1990s, Nightshade was included in a roster of prospective Justice League members by producer Bruce Timm. Plans for the original series were canceled and production moved onto \"\". She did not make into the \"Justice League\" series once it entered production.\n\nNocturna was scheduled to appear in an episode of \"\" as a vampire, but the episode was canceled after Fox censors objected to the storyline, which would have involved Batman being turned into a vampire and craving human blood.\n\n"}
{"id": "2260591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260591", "title": "Beauce, Quebec", "text": "Beauce, Quebec\n\nBeauce (; ) is a historical and traditional region of Quebec located south of Quebec City. It corresponds approximately to the regional county municipalities of Beauce-Sartigan, Robert-Cliche and La Nouvelle-Beauce, and its major communities are Saint-Georges, Sainte-Marie, Beauceville, Saint-Joseph-de-Beauce and Saint-Victor.\n\nThe first record of the name goes back to 1739. \"Nouvelle Beauce\" (New Beauce) designated the \"seigneuries\" granted earlier along the Chaudière River and which would later become the current cities of Sainte-Marie, Saint-Joseph-de-Beauce, Beauceville, and Saint-Georges, as well as several other communities which would detach from these territories.\n\nAccording to accounts from Governor Charles de Beauharnois de la Boische and Intendant Gilles Hocquart, \"Beauce\" was chosen by \"seigneurs\" Joseph de Fleury de La Gorgendière, Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil and Thomas-Jacques Taschereau to develop the potential of colonization, as the name recalls the French Beauce, a region renowned for its wheat production. In 1829, the name represented a county extending to the Canada–US border with Maine.\n\nLater, Beauce would also be the name of administrative, municipal, electoral, school and judicial subdivisions, sometimes with different borders. Today, residents of neighbouring regional county municipalities consider themselves \"Beaucerons\" (masculine) or \"Beauceronnes\" (feminine) because of the former administrative links. They describe themselves as fiercely independent and mentioning how they do not look to government for help and believe in entrepreneurship and solidarity.\n\nHistorically, Beaucerons have also been known under the nickname of \"Jarrets noirs\" (black hocks). Travelling to Quebec City took up to one week, and because of the hilly roads and their conditions, they would often have to push their farm carts. They would get their legs dirty and arrive at the destination with their hocks black.\n\nBlack hocks actually referred to the hocks of their horses being black when they got to Quebec City because of the abundance of peaty bogs or wetlands on the journey there. Horses legs would sink up to their hocks and become covered in the muck and therefore be blackened.\n\nExclusively agricultural for many years, Beauce's economy slowly diversified in the first half of the 20th century through forestry, wood processing, and the leather and textile industries. In 1951, the industrial production value became for the first time superior to agriculture, likely due to strong local entrepreneurship and cheap labour. Today's economy relies especially on small and medium enterprises in the industries of furniture, food, clothing, printing and metalworking. It is known as Quebec's entrepreneurial heartland.\n\n\n"}

In Sanford's re-election victory, he also garnered 22% of the African American vote, which was considered very high for a Republican statewide candidate.\n\nTommy Moore, a State Senator from western South Carolina, emerged with Florence Mayor Frank Willis as the major candidates in the Democratic primary election for governor. Rumors circulated that Superintendent of Education and former U.S. Senate candidate, Inez Tenenbaum, might enter the race, but she ultimately chose not to run for governor nor seek re-election to her position. Kenneth Holland, a former U.S. Representative from the 5th congressional district, briefly entered the race, but dropped out a month later after failing to raise enough financial contributions.\n\nMoore and Willis traded barbs over campaign contributions made by Willis and his wife to prominent Republicans, including President George W. Bush and Senator Lindsey Graham. Attorney C. Dennis Aughtry, who entered the campaign at the eleventh hour, floated the idea of legalizing casinos statewide to raise money for public schools. Moore garnered more than 50% of the vote in the Democratic primary held on June 13 and thus avoided a runoff election.\n\nPortending a sign of trouble, incumbent Governor Mark Sanford faced a primary challenge from Oscar Lovelace, a physician from the Midlands. When former Governor David Beasley ran for re-election in 1998, he faced a primary challenge and went on to lose the general election to Jim Hodges. Sanford's veto of a heart center for Lexington County and theatrics such as bringing pigs to the Statehouse to show his displeasure of pork barrel spending by the General Assembly angered and annoyed many Republicans. However, Sanford's strategy of avoiding Lovelace and refusal to debate worked as the governor scored a decisive victory in the primary on June 13.\n\nGovernor Mark Sanford proposed three major issues in his campaign for re-election, chief among them being the restructuring of state government. He wanted to reduce the number of statewide elected officials from nine to three and eliminate the state's Budget and Control Board. The governor insisted that these measures would reduce the number of redundant positions and make state government both more efficient and less costly. Sanford's three major issues for the campaign were:\n\nState Senator Tommy Moore ran as a good manager of state government. He held socially conservative and fiscally moderate positions, which put him squarely at odds with the libertarian incumbent. Moore disagreed with what he believed was Sanford's condescending and combative approach of dealing with the General Assembly. The senator also believed that Sanford lacked leadership skills, and that lack of leadership had brought South Carolina to a standstill over the past four years in his view. The main policy proposals that he developed were:\n\nOn July 7, several weeks after the primary election, Lexington County State Senator Jake Knotts launched a last minute effort to place his name on the ballot as a petition candidate for governor. He had feuded with Governor Sanford over a number of issues, including the heart center for Lexington County, and supported Lovelace in the Republican primary. In order to be on the ballot in November, Knotts needed to collect 10,000 signatures of registered voters by July 17, which he failed to do. Knotts's political consultant publicly stated that he could not have raised enough money to have run a successful candidacy.\n\nThere were two trains of thought on the effects of a candidacy by Knotts. It was generally believed that had Knotts entered the race, it would have split the Republican vote and helped elect Tommy Moore. However, because those who supported Knotts went on to support Moore, it was also argued that a Knotts candidacy would have in fact deprived Moore of both votes and money.\n\n\n"}

The village boasts a single church, post office and a pub, the Cadogan Arms which closed in 2006 for refurbishment.\n\nIngham is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. Possible etymologies are \"homestead or village of a man called Inga\" or \"home of the Inguiones\" (an ancient Germanic tribe).\n\nThe Church is dedicated to St. Bartholomew and is Church of England. The post office provides some local library links. The village school was a one-room school serving the small class of all grades. It closed in the mid 1980s as a result of declining numbers, despite the expansion of the village with the new housing estate in the 1960s and 1970s. Locals are mainly employed in Bury St Edmunds or Thetford, commuting to work, though some work locally in agriculture or transport industries.\n\nSituated on a slight rise north of Bury St Edmunds the village has a large green, formerly including school playing fields to the east of the main road reached by a lane between the Church and the Post Office. Beyond the green lies the abandoned railway cutting - the line and Ingham railway station closed in the 1950s, though Ingham is still served by buses.\n\nThetford Forest lies a few miles to the north west.\n"}

It broadcasts a high definition digital signal on VHF channel 12 (or virtual channel 13 via PSIP) from a transmitter atop Casper Mountain. The station maintains studios on Progress Circle in Mills, Wyoming.\n\nKCWY serves as the NBC affiliate for most of Wyoming through four low-powered translators: KSWY-LP (channel 29) in Sheridan (currently off the air), KCHY-LP (channel 13) in Cheyenne, KWYM-LP (channel 14) in Laramie and K28HL-D (channel 28) in Riverton. KCWY's programming is also simulcast on the second digital subchannel of KSGW-TV (channel 12) in Sheridan. All stations, except K28HL-D, are owned by Gray Television.\n\nKCWY signed on the air in February 2001 as an affiliate of the Pax TV network. On September 1, 2003, KCWY became the new NBC affiliate in the Casper market after NBC severed its affiliation with longtime affiliate KTWO-TV (channel 2). KCWY launched its first newscast (\"News 13 First at Five\") on September 22, 2003.\n\nIn 2008, 2011 and 2012, the Wyoming Association of Broadcasters named KCWY its \"Television Station of the Year\". In June 2013, Intermountain West Communications Company filed to sell KCWY to Frontier Radio Management, through subsidiary Yellowstone Holdings; the deal made it a sister station with KGWN-TV, which SagamoreHill Broadcasting was also selling to Yellowstone through a separate deal. On November 4, 2013, Gray Television announced a deal to acquire Yellowstone Holdings for $23 million. As a result of the acquisition, KCHY-LP was consolidated with KGWN-TV. The sale was completed on December 31.\n\nGray launched The CW Plus on a subchannel of KCWY on January 26, 2015.\n\nOn January 24, 2019, Gray announced that KCWY-DT would merge its news operation with KGWN-TV by April 9, under the \"Wyoming News Now\" banner, a banner similar to those used by some sister stations that were recently acquired from Raycom Media. Under this arrangement, KCWY's 5 p.m. newscast will be the only Casper-specific newscast, with \"Jeopardy!\" replacing the 6 p.m. newscast, and all other newscasts being simulcast from KGWN in Cheyenne and covering both markets. Four of KCWY's 15 news staffers will be retained in Casper following the merger, with the remainder being offered positions at other Gray stations. The consolidation came after the Department of Justice (DOJ) blocked Gray's acquisition of the CBS affiliation of KGWC-TV (channel 14), which would have given Gray a second revenue stream to cover KCWY's financial losses.\n\n\n"}

One of its most important uses is the determination of nitrite in drinking water. The \"Griess diazotization reaction\" on which the Griess reagent relies was first described in 1858 by Peter Griess. The test is also been widely used for the detection of nitrates, which are converted to nitrites prior to applying the Griess test. Nitrates are common components of explosives. \n\nNitrite is detected and analyzed by formation of a red pink colour upon treatment of a NO-containing sample with the Griess reagent.\n\nWhen Sulfanilamide is added (or sulphanilic acid), the nitrite ion reacts to form a diazonium salt. When the azo dye agent (N-alpha-naphthyl-ethylenediamine) is formed a pink color develops. This diamine is used in place of the simpler and cheaper alpha-naphthylamine because the latter is a potent carcinogen and moreover the diamine forms a more polar and hence a much more soluble dye in acidic aqueous medium.\n\nA typical commercial Griess reagent contains 0.2% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride, and 2% sulphanilamide in 5% phosphoric acid.\n\nThe test was used in forensics for many years to test for the traces of nitroglycerine.\n\nCaustic soda is used to break down sample containing nitroglycerine to produce nitrite ions. \n\nThe test involves the taking of a sample with ether and its division into two bowls. Sodium hydroxide is added to the first bowl followed by the Griess reagent; if the solution turns pink within ten seconds, this indicates the presence of nitrites. The test itself is positive if, after adding only Griess reagent to the second bowl, the solution there remains clear\n\nThe convictions of Judith Ward and the Birmingham Six were assisted by Frank Skuse's flawed interpretation of Griess test results.\n"}

{"id": "2260663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260663", "title": "Gavin Lambert", "text": "Gavin Lambert\n\nGavin Lambert (23 July 1924 – 17 July 2005) was a British-born screenwriter, novelist and biographer who lived for part of his life in Hollywood. His writing was mainly fiction and nonfiction about the film industry.\n\nLambert was educated at Cheltenham College and Magdalen College, Oxford, where one of his professors was C. S. Lewis. At Oxford, he befriended Penelope Houston and filmmakers Karel Reisz and Lindsay Anderson, and they founded a short-lived but influential journal, \"Sequence\", which was originally edited by Houston. The magazine, which lasted for only 15 issues, moved to London after the fifth issue, and Lambert and Anderson took over as co-editors. Lambert eventually left Oxford without obtaining a degree. From 1949 to 1956 he edited the journal \"Sight and Sound\", again with Anderson as a regular contributor. At about the same time Lambert was deeply involved in Britain's Free Cinema movement which called for more social realism in contemporary movies. He also wrote film criticism for \"The Sunday Times\" and \"The Guardian\". In late 1955, he moved to Hollywood, California, to work as a personal assistant to director Nicholas Ray and worked on the script (uncredited) for Ray's \"Bigger Than Life\" (1956). Later, he co-wrote the screenplay for Ray's film \"Bitter Victory\" (1957). According to the critic David Robinson, Lambert was Ray's lover for a time.\n\nGavin Lambert became an American citizen in 1964. From 1974 to 1989, he chiefly stayed in Tangier, where he was a close friend of the writer and composer Paul Bowles. He spent the final years of his life in Los Angeles, where he died of pulmonary fibrosis on 17 July 2005. He left behind a brother, niece and nephew, and named Mart Crowley executor of his estate.\n\nGavin's father's half-sister was Ivy Claudine Godber aka Claudine West (1890-1943), a screenwriter who won an Oscar for her joint writing of the script of \"Mrs. Miniver\" in 1942.\n\nHis papers are currently housed at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University.\n\nLambert became a notable screenwriter of the Hollywood studio era. In 1954, while still living in England, he wrote his first screenplay, \"Another Sky\", about the sexual awakening of a prim English woman in North Africa. In 1955, he also directed \"Another Sky\" in Morocco. This was followed in 1958 by the Hollywood screenplay, \"Bitter Victory\" and in 1960 by \"Sons and Lovers\". The latter, for which Lambert gained an Academy Award nomination, is based on a novel by D. H. Lawrence. \"The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone\" (1961) adapted a novella by Tennessee Williams on the affairs of an older actress with a young Italian gigolo. As, from the 1920s through the late 1960s, homosexuality was rarely portrayed on the screen, gay screenwriters like Lambert learned to express their personal sensibilities discreetly between the lines of a film. \"The important thing to remember about 'gay influence' in movies,\" observed Gavin Lambert, \"is that it was obviously never direct. It was all subliminal. It couldn't be direct because the mass audience would say, Hey, no way.\"\n\nIt was not until 1965 that Lambert adapted his own Hollywood insider novel \"Inside Daisy Clover\" (1963) for the screen. \"Clover\", starring Natalie Wood and Robert Redford, tells the cautionary tale of a teenage movie star involved in the Hollywood studio system of the 1930s and her unhappy marriage to a closeted gay leading man. However, in the film version he was not fully identified as gay because at Redford's request, the husband he played was changed from homosexual to appear as though he might be bisexual. From this time on, Lambert and Wood became lifelong friends. Another of Lambert's screenplays was \"I Never Promised You a Rose Garden\" (1977), based on a novel by Hannah Green, which describes in layman's terms a teenager's battle with schizophrenia. Later, the author also wrote the scripts for some TV movies such as \"Second Serve\" (1986) on transgender tennis player Renée Richards and \"Liberace: Behind the Music\" (1988) on gay performer Liberace. In 1997, he contributed to Stephen Frears's film \"A Personal History of British Cinema\". He was heavily quoted in William J. Mann's book, \"Behind the Screen: How Gays and Lesbians Shaped Hollywood, 1910-1969.\"\n\nLambert was also a biographer and novelist, who focused his efforts on biographies of gay and lesbian figures in Hollywood.\n\nAccording to screenwriter and writer Joseph McBride, he was \"a keenly observant, wryly witty chronicler of Hollywood's social mores and artistic achievements.\" He wrote biographies on Hollywood figures such as \"On Cukor\" (1972) on film director George Cukor and \"Norma Shearer: A Life\" (1990) on the Canadian actress Norma Shearer. His book, \"Nazimova: A Biography\" (1997) was the first full-scale account of the private life and acting career of lesbian actress Alla Nazimova. He was the author of the memoir \"Mainly About Lindsay Anderson\" (2000) (whose title echoed that of Anderson's own work, \"About John Ford\").\n\nHe also wrote the book \"GWTW: The Making of Gone with the Wind\" (Little, Brown and Company, 1973). Working as a Hollywood screenwriter, Lambert was able to interview and gain personal remembrances of most of the cast and crew involved with the film, including dismissed director George Cukor and star Vivien Leigh (Scarlett O'Hara).\n\nHis final biography, \"Natalie Wood: A Life\" (2004) supplied an insider's look at actress Natalie Wood and chronicled everything concerning her life, since Lambert was a friend of Wood for sixteen years. The book was praised by Natalie Wood's daughter, Natasha Gregson Wagner, as \"a wonderful biography on my Mom. It will be the definitive biography on my mother.\" Lambert's biography includes Wood's relationship with Elvis Presley, and interviews with the people who knew Wood best, such as Robert Wagner, Warren Beatty, Tony Curtis, Paul Mazursky, Tab Hunter and Leslie Caron. In his book, Lambert controversially claimed that Wood frequently dated gay and bisexual men, including director Nicholas Ray and actors Nick Adams, Raymond Burr, James Dean, Tab Hunter, and Scott Marlowe. Lambert said that Wood supported homosexual playwright Mart Crowley (a later lover of Lambert's) in a manner that made it possible for him to write his play, \"The Boys in the Band\" (1968). Lambert's final book was \"The Ivan Moffat File: Life Among the Beautiful and Damned in London, Paris, New York and Hollywood\" (2004).\n\nLambert also wrote seven novels primarily with Hollywood settings, among them \"The Slide Area: Scenes of Hollywood Life\" (1959), a collection of seven short stories that portray a bevy of tinsel-town lowlifes, \"Inside Daisy Clover\" (1963), \"The Goodbye People\" (1971) about Hollywood's beautiful people, and \"Running Time\" (1982), a portrait of an indefatigable woman from child starlet to screen goddess, but also a unique life history of the American film industry. In 1996, Lambert wrote the introduction to \"3 Plays\", a collection of works by his longtime friend, Mart Crowley.\n\n"}
{"id": "2260679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260679", "title": "West Stow", "text": "West Stow\n\nWest Stow is a small village and civil parish in West Suffolk, England. The village lies north of Bury St. Edmunds, south of Mildenhall and Thetford and west of the villages of Culford and Ingham in the area known as the Breckland. This area is located near the Lark River Valley and was settled from around AD 420–650.\n\nIts name may come from Anglo-Saxon \"wēste stōw\" = \"deserted place\", rather than \"western place\".\n\nWest Stow is home to the West Stow Anglo-Saxon village where visitors may see reconstructed Anglo-Saxon houses, and often living history re-enactments of Dark Ages life.\n\nFullers Mill Garden run by Perennial (Gardeners' Royal Benevolent Society) is open to the public.\n\nA major archaeological dig from 1965–1972 headed by Dr. Stanley West of West Suffolk Archaeology Unit revealed a well preserved Anglo-Saxon site beneath the sands of the Breckland. Dr. West’s findings contributed to much of what is now known about this area. The site’s layout tells us much about the way of life in this period. This area is set up with a large hall in the middle of the village surrounded by other houses and structures. This suggests a tight-knit community, with the inhabitants using the large hall for events such as feasts and story-telling. During the excavation 69 houses, 7 halls and 7 other structures were found. The community lived with their extended families in their houses, with each house containing around 10 family members. The people of this area still traded with their homeland, as is evidenced by the glass in the necklaces and other metals that were found at the site, but not produced locally.\nThe Anglo-Saxon community that was found here was not the first to settle in the area. The remains of circular huts with ditched enclosures suggest occupation by Iron Age farmers. There were also tools found that suggest that Mesolithic warriors had hunted in this area, and burial grounds and cultivation which suggest settlement of a Neolithic group.\nA pagan Anglo-Saxon burial ground was also excavated. The archaeologists revealed that the village moved the mile or so east to its current location following Christianisation.\n\nAlongside the recreated village are the archaeological collections formerly housed at Moyse's Hall Museum Bury St Edmunds. These are collections of archaeological findings that were made in the region between Devil's Dyke and the line between Littleport and Shippea Hill (i.e. along the borderline of East Cambridgeshire and Suffolk) from the Stone Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. Findings include the Isleham Hoard of more than 6500 pieces of bronze, in particular swords, spear-heads, arrows, axes, knives, daggers, armour, decorative equipment (in particular for horses) and many fragments of sheet bronze, all dating from the late Bronze Age. The swords show holes where rivets or studs held the wooden hilt in place (studs were usually made of bronze except for commanders who had silver-studded swords or for a commander-in-chief who had a gold-studded sword).\n\nAmong the more interesting findings of the excavations pertain to the farming aspect of this culture. This village, and others like it, replaced Roman farms after the imperial administration left Britain. The Anglo-Saxons settled in small villages that were generally self-sustaining. Within these self-sufficient communities there is evidence that these peoples were more likely to provide for themselves through a farming lifestyle than a foraging one. Within the archaeological remains there were more domesticated animal species found than wild animal species, indicating less dependence on hunting as a means of survival, and supports the idea that they were farmers.\nThe settlers in this area were thought to be from a different area, with German descent being the most likely area, and as such it is interesting to see what farming techniques may be employed by this group. Since the landscapes are quite different, it would be interesting to see if the newly settled group would use a German style of farming in this new terrain. This area helps to provide some insight into these farming adaptations. Within animal husbandry, however, this group was more likely to use elements found within the native system of the country.\n\n\n\n"}

The M77 motorway runs directly to the west of the neighbourhood, with Junction 3 serving the area; a small industrial estate is located to the south-east (this falls within Glasgow although is named after the neighbouring settlement of Thornliebank in East Renfrewshire). The residential area of Carnwadric is to the north-east of Arden, and the Jenny Lind part of Deaconsbank to the south, while the land to the north is open ground (formerly Kennishead Farm) and woodland.\n\nHistorically, Arden was a farm and formed part of Sir John Maxwell's land, one of approximately seven adjoining holdings which were situated on ancient Stewart land, originally granted to Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland by Robert the Bruce upon his marriage to Marjorie Bruce, the King's eldest daughter. Arden is near Thornliebank, a village formed on the river to manufacture cloth and a specialized printing of cloth known as beetling; Thornliebank linen was quite famous from the early-nineteenth century until the closure of the mill, in or around 1920. The building adjoining part of what is now Arden was used as a Prisoner of War (POW) camp during the Second World War.\n\nThe S.S.H.A (Scottish Special Housing Association) built the estate (consisting mostly of four-storey tenements with a common close entrance) between 1953 and 1957 to rehouse families from the old, overcrowded inner city tenements. Arden became very run-down during the 1970s and 1980s, with grants made for its refurbishment. It is not quite completed but is much improved. The shopping area containing around six businesses is in immediate need of investment and refurbishment. In 1999, the estate was bought by \"Glen Oaks Housing Association\" for a rumoured £6 million but the association has since acknowledged this may have been a rather inflated sum, and they have struggled to make necessary repairs as they are funded only by rents.\n\nArden became the first housing scheme to have a public house (The Cuillins) privately built in 1964-5 which then became a brewery pub in 1968.\n\nArden boasts the new Ashpark Primary School which opened on 2 December 2008 and replaced the former Arden Primary School and Carnwadric Primary School. The second school, St. Louise Primary was merged with the newly rebuilt St. Vincent's Primary in Carnwadric, St. Louise's closed in June 2009 and the buildings subsequently demolished. \n\nThe nearest railway station is , named after another of Sir John Maxwell's farms.\n\nArden featured in the documentary programme \"Colin and Justin on the Estate\" which looked at the efforts to improve the area. Some of the current and former residents of Arden, were concerned about the slant of the show, and were particularly annoyed by the fact that the producers of the show concentrated their attention on housing units that were scheduled for demolition and not on housing that had seen extensive and successful renovation. Alasdair McKee, Glen Oaks chief executive, concluded however, that the program was a success and \"the improvements have helped to convince people that we can make a difference\" and contributed to a waiting list of people wanting to get into the estate.\n\n"}

Their basal bodies give rise to a several long sheets of microtubules, which form an organelle called an axostyle, but different in structure from the axostyles of parabasalids.

He is also the Honorary President of the Society for International Hockey Research. He is the son of writer Leslie McFarlane. He is best known as a broadcaster on Hockey Night In Canada and as an author of hockey books.\n\nBrian McFarlane was raised in Whitby and Ottawa Ontario. He attended St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York, on a hockey scholarship, graduating in 1955. In his four years he scored 101 goals for the Skating Saints, which remains a St. Lawrence record. On three occasions, he scored five goals in a game, a school record shared with several others. McFarlane was honoured as an All-American in 1952.\n\nAfter graduating, he worked in television at WRGB in Schenectady, New York, before moving to CFRB Radio in Toronto, Ontario and then CFCF-TV in Montreal, Quebec (where he was sports director) and CFTO TV in Toronto. He had a lengthy career in broadcasting and journalism.\n\nHe is best known as a commentator on \"Hockey Night in Canada,\" beginning in 1964. He made similar broadcasts on NHL games for the major American networks CBS and NBC. He was a colour commentator on Toronto Maple Leafs local telecasts until 1980, when he made on-air comments that were supportive of Leaf captain Darryl Sittler and critical of Leafs owner Harold Ballard. He was subsequently banned from the Maple Leaf Gardens press box. For \"Hockey Night in Canada\", he was moved off Toronto games at this point, broadcasting the Montreal Canadiens and Winnipeg Jets games. His last year with HNIC was 1991, ending a 28-year association with HNIC.\n\nMcFarlane is often incorrectly cited as the creator or father of the cartoon character Peter Puck. The cartoon puck, which appeared on both \"NBC's Hockey Game of the Week\" and CBC's \"Hockey Night in Canada\" during the 1970s, was actually the creation of NBC executive Donald Carswell, although McFarlane had significant input. The character itself and the animation footage was created by NBC's production partner, Hanna-Barbera. After the network stopped carrying NHL hockey, McFarlane purchased the rights to Peter Puck from Hanna-Barbera and continued to promote the character.\n\nAs of 2010, McFarlane had written more than 96 (with one in the works) books on hockey, selling over 1.3 million books. His first book, \"50 Years of Hockey\" (Pagurian Press) was published in 1968 and he continues to write about hockey. McFarlane is an expert on hockey history and has compiled several volumes of NHL lore titled \"It Happened in Hockey\", a 1999 series detailing the colourful history of the Original Six NHL teams, and \"Proud Past Bright Future,\" the history of Women's Hockey (1994, Stoddard, ). He published two memoirs, \"Brian McFarlane's World of Hockey\" (2000, Stoddart Publishing, ) republished as \"Colour Commentary\" (2009, Key Porter, ) and \"From The Broadcast Booth\" (2009, Fenn, ). In 2008, he began a youth fiction series \"The Mitchell Brothers\" which always features hockey in the plots.\n\nThroughout his career, McFarlane collected much memorabilia, photos, and objects focusing primarily on hockey history. In 2006, Brian sold most of his hockey collection to the Municipality of Clarington, where it became Total Hockey, a multimedia, interactive museum located at the Garnet B. Rickard Recreation Complex in Bowmanville. The museum was closed in 2007 and the collection was sold to an Edmonton-based collector in 2013. Plans for the collection have not been made public, but McFarlane was assured by the purchaser that the collection would be preserved and made available to the public at some point.\n\nFrom his teenage years, McFarlane was interested in painting. In semi-retirement he began painting regularly producing several hundred paintings, mostly in the Group-of-Seven style of Canadian landscapes. McFarlane has since become an accomplished painter, exhibiting professionally.\n\nMcFarlane currently resides in the Greater Toronto area.\n\n\n"}

Bush on March 25, 2003, entitled \"Further Amendment to Executive Order 12958, as Amended, Classified National Security Information.\" The Executive Order modified the manner in which sensitive information was handled at the time as set out by President Bill Clinton's 1995 executive order.\n\nClinton's order set declassification deadlines for classified material and made it harder for politicians to classify information. Bush's order appears to allow much more information to be classified and for longer periods; the wording is hard to decipher in some areas. It also appears to give more power over classification to the Offices of the President and Vice President, but the wording used was not properly defined in the listing of relevant definitions now consolidated into their own section in Part 6 of the Executive Order.\n\nAmong the various changes made to the 1995-based regulations, Executive Order 13292 notably:\nA more extensive analysis of the changes from the previous executive order was compiled by the group Public Citizen.\n\nThen-Vice President Dick Cheney said in a February 15, 2006, interview, \"There is an executive order that specifies who has classification authority, and obviously focuses first and foremost on the President, but also includes the Vice President.\" This was based in the then newly added but undefined and untested wording stipulating the Vice President's ability to exercise classification authority rested “in the performance of [his] executive duties,”. The phrase no longer appears in Executive Order 13526 though the Vice President is directly listed rather than amended in separately via a standard Order.\n\nByron York of the \"National Review\" noted, \"Throughout Executive Order 13292, there are changes to the original Clinton order which, in effect, give the vice president the power of the president in dealing with classified material...Executive Order 13292 is further evidence of real power in the vice president's office.\" \n\nThis analysis is contradicted by the supplemental Order of October 13, 1995 issued pursuant to Sec. 1.4 (a)(2) of President Clinton's Executive Order 12958 of April 17, 1995 declaring the Vice President as a designated official with the same ability to originate classified information at the highest level, \"Top Secret\", and by design - the lower-levels and further delegations by default, as if named directly in the original Executive Order pursuant to the clause directly preceding it [Sec. 1.4(a)(1)]. The subsequent revisions to the regulations governing Classified National Security Information practices by both Presidents Bush and Obama differed from EO 12958 in that they declared the Vice President directly in their original issuances rather than in a supplemental Order as President Clinton had.\n\nExecutive Order 12958 and the amendments incorporated into it, including Executive Order 13292, were revoked by President Barack Obama in the issuance of Executive Order 13526.\n\n"}

He quit school at age sixteen to work for the Illinois Central Railroad. Within four years, he started his own business, the Consolidated Street Railway Advertising Company of New York City. At age twenty-six, his assets were valued at a million dollars.\nIn 1907, Barron Collier married, Juliet Gordon Carnes, also a native of Memphis. In 1911, they visited Fort Myers, Florida, on vacation, and fell in love with the area. They bought nearby Useppa Island for the sum of $100,000. \n\nCollier was an avid fisherman and established the Izaak Walton Club at their Useppa Island resort; it became one of the most exclusive sporting clubs in the world. Collier next developed golf courses and improved the Rod and Gun Club, a hunting club in Everglades City, Florida, that also attracted wealthy tourists. Over the next decade, the Colliers went on to acquire more than a million acres (4000 km²) of land in Southwest Florida, making them the largest private land owners in the state. He invested millions of dollars to transform and develop the wilderness, including drainage of the Everglades and construction of the Tamiami Trail. To recognize his influence on, and investment in, the state's future, the Florida legislature named the newly created Collier County for him on May 8, 1923.\n\nHe manifested tremendous energy in other pursuits. He was involved in the national Boy Scout movement. In New York, serving as special deputy commissioner for public safety, he introduced the use of white and yellow traffic divider lines on highways. Following the Lindbergh kidnapping in March 1932, he was influential in persuading the U.S. government to join, in 1938, INTERPOL, which had been formed in 1923. He was decorated by nine foreign governments.\n\nHis wife, Juliet Carnes Collier, appeared on the cover of the U.S. edition of the \"Tatler\", the Tatler and American Sketch, in the early 1930s.\n\nCollier died March 13, 1939, in Manhattan, survived by his wife and three sons, Barron Jr., Miles, and Samuel, and was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in Bronx, New York. Although the Great Depression had strained his finances and slowed development of their Florida lands, the next generations of his family would continue his development work in subsequent decades.\n\nThe family members participated in many sports, including motorsports, and especially road racing, which led to the sons Miles and Sam founding the \"Automobile Racing Club of America\" in 1933, renamed in 1944 as the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA). Miles, Cameron Argetsinger, and Briggs Cunningham were instrumental in founding the Watkins Glen racing facility, near one of their summer retreats. Juliet worried about the risks of racing and tried to influence her sons against it; Sam would indeed die in a racing accident. Briggs's renowned automobile collection was purchased by a member of the Collier family, and is now part of the Revs Institute for Automotive Research in Naples, Florida, which is open to the public.\n\nThe Collier County Public School System named Barron Collier High School in honor of Barron Gift Collier, Sr.\n\n"}

The resulting force being continuous in one direction, the homopolar motor needs no commutator but still requires slip rings. The name \"homopolar\" indicates that the electrical polarity of the conductor and the magnetic field poles do not change (i.e., that it does not require commutation).\n\nThe homopolar motor was the first electrical motor to be built. Its operation was demonstrated by Michael Faraday in 1821 at the Royal Institution in London.\n\nIn 1821, soon after the Danish physicist and chemist Hans Christian Ørsted discovered the phenomenon of electromagnetism, Humphry Davy and British scientist William Hyde Wollaston tried, but failed, to design an electric motor. Faraday, having been challenged by Humphry as a joke, went on to build two devices to produce what he called \"electromagnetic rotation\". One of these, now known as the \"homopolar motor\", caused a continuous circular motion that was engendered by the circular magnetic force around a wire that extended into a pool of mercury wherein was placed a magnet. The wire would then rotate around the magnet if supplied with current from a chemical battery. These experiments and inventions formed the foundation of modern electromagnetic technology. In his excitement, Faraday published results. This strained his mentor relationship with Davy, due to his mentor's jealousy of Faraday's achievement, and is the reason for Faraday’s assignment to other activities, which consequently prevented his involvement in electromagnetic research for several years.\n\nB. G. Lamme described in 1913 a homopolar machine rated 2,000 kW, 260 V, 7,700 A and 1,200 rpm with 16 slip rings operating at a peripheral velocity of 67 m/s. A unipolar generator rated 1,125 kW, 7.5 V 150,000 A, 514 rpm built in 1934 was installed in a U.S. steel mill for pipe welding purposes.\n\nThe homopolar motor is driven by the Lorentz force. A conductor with a current flowing through it when placed in a magnetic field which is perpendicular to the current feels a force in the direction perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the current. This force provides a torque around the axis of rotation. Because the axis of rotation is parallel to the magnetic field, and the opposing magnetic fields do not change polarity, no commutation is required for the conductor to keep turning. This simplicity is most readily achieved with single turn designs, which makes homopolar motors unsuitable for most practical applications.\n\nLike most electro-mechanical machines, a homopolar motor is reversible: if the conductor is turned mechanically, then it will operate as a homopolar generator, producing a direct current voltage between the two terminals of the conductor. The direct current produced is an effect of the homopolar nature of the design. Homopolar generators (HPGs) were extensively researched in the late 20th century as low voltage but very high current DC power supplies and have achieved some success powering experimental railguns.\n\nA homopolar motor is very easy to build. A permanent magnet is used to provide the external magnetic field in which the conductor will turn, and a battery causes a current to flow along a conducting wire. It is not necessary for the magnet to move, or even to be in contact with the rest of the motor; its sole purpose is to provide a magnetic field that will interact with the magnetic field induced by the current in the wire. One can attach the magnet to the battery and allow the conducting wire to rotate freely while closing the electric circuit by touching both the top of the battery and the magnet attached to the bottom of the battery. The wire and the battery may become hot if operated continuously. \n\n"}

In its earliest incarnations, the fair focused on economic practicalities such as the sale of horses and cattle. In the modern era, the fair has become known for its amusements, with circus and theatre shows as centerpieces.\n\nThe Glasgow Fair has been a nexus for traveling showmen, who congregate in order to take advantage of the large audiences. This provided the fair with a diverse roster of entertainers and performances. The 1912 fair, for example, featured a traditional penny gaff as well as short melodramas.

It is usually the driver who leaves a starting area first from a standing start (stopped position).\n\nThe term is used in motorcycle racing, off-road racing (but also motorsport racing in general) for the rider who is the first one through the first turn. In some cases a holeshot award will be given, which is a prize separate from winning the race. \n\nMany motorcycle racers consider the start to be the most important part of a race, and it is particularly important in those forms of the sport where the tracks are very small, tight and difficult to pass on. This is particularly relevant in motocross where racers line up alongside each other rather than behind each other in tarmac-based sports. The term had also found its way into bicycle motocross racing (BMX) by the early 1970s because BMX is a bicycle derivative of motorcycle motocross and has inherited many terms from that sport. In BMX the holeshot is even more important since BMX races are single lap 25 to 45 second races with only a few opportunities to pass in that time period. Achieving the holeshot in BMX will earn the rider a victory the majority of the time.\n\nThis term can also be used to describe the starting performance of a vehicle. A vehicle that is fast off the line (though not necessarily fast overall) is said to have a good \"holeshot\". \n\nA holeshot maneuver in off-road bicycle racing (mountain biking or cyclocross) is when a racer moves from the relatively flat, open area of the start to the narrower confines of the single track ahead of the other racers. A successful holeshot affords the first racer some control over the tempo of the race, as passing on the narrow single track can break the passing racer's rhythm.\nIn drag racing, a \"holeshot win\" refers to a victory in which a rider runs a slower elapsed time (E.T.), but wins the race due to a faster reaction time at the start.\n"}

The buses are bright yellow and are commonly called 'Strætó' by the locals, a shortened nickname for \"strætisvagn\" ('urban bus', literally \"street carriage\"). Strætó bs started operations on 1 July 2001 with the merger of SVR (Strætisvagnar Reykjavíkur) and AV (Almenningsvagnar). SVR previously operated in Reykjavík and nearby satellites in the northern part of the Capital region while AV covered the southern part of the area. Strætó bs is owned and run by the seven municipalities in the Capital area, i.e. Reykjavík, Kópavogur, Hafnarfjörður, Garðabær, Mosfellsbær, Seltjarnarnes and Álftanes.\n\nMost buses run at about 15-minute intervals during peak hours on weekdays and in 30-minute intervals during off-peak hours and weekends. There are 30 routes, 6 of which are \"trunk routes\" (red-routes 1–6) that run between the main terminal at Hlemmur and the various residential neighbourhoods on the city's outskirts; these use the main traffic arteries and are thus the fastest routes available. Nine of the routes are \"general routes\" (green-routes 11–19) that also stop at Hlemmur terminal but go deeper into the different neighborhoods on slower streets. The remaining 15 routes are \"neighborhood routes\" (blue-routes 21–24, 26–28 and 33–35 that run within or between the suburbs and do not stop in downtown Reykjavík. Bus routes 51, 52, 57, 71, 72, 73 are long-distance routes that run to towns in Vesturland (West Iceland) and Suðurland (South Iceland).\n\nThe buses operate from 9 terminals in the Capital Region. The main ones are Hlemmur and Lækjartorg in downtown Reykjavik; the others are at Hamraborg in Kópavogur, Fjörður in Hafnarfjörður, Ásgarður in Garðabær, Ártún, Mjódd, Spöngin in Reykjavík and Háholt in Mosfellsbær. All of these main bus terminals are served by at least one red (trunk) route.\n\n\"Notes:\"\n\n\"Notes:\"\n\n\nThe basic fare for a single ride in 2019 is ISK 470 for adults but discounts are available for children, senior citizens and disabled people.\n\nOn 23 July 2005, a new route network was instituted to replace the previous network, which had been used practically unchanged for decades. New routes had been added in new-developing areas, but the core routes were largely untouched until 2005. Planning for the revised network began in 2001. Its greatest change was introduction of the 'trunk routes' and their increased frequency during peak hours. Unfortunately, the introduction of the new network caused a great deal of controversy and confusion as people (especially senior citizens, who make up a large percentage of those who actually use the service) had gotten used to the old routes. Additionally, some smaller neighbourhoods were entirely cut out of the routes, resulting in long walks to the nearest bus station. The controversy seems to have died down, and in fact complaints have arisen every time the system has been changed in the past.\n\nOn 5 March 2006, some refinements were made to the network in response to comments from users and drivers after the 2005 revision. The greatest change was the addition of 3 routes to better cover some neighborhoods and increase interlinking between areas.\n\nIn 2010, a new green line 16 was added to provide a bus at every 15 minutes between Hlemmur and Nauthóll. Also, the course of route 18 was changed, it now terminates at Grafarholt instead of going through to Spöngin. Transportation service is provided by the new blue line 26 by connecting Spöngin and Hraunsás. For both lines, a new stop 'Mímisbrunnur v/Úlfarsbraut' was added. In late summer, there were other changes: Lines 31/32 that used to go through the area around Spöngin (terminus of Route 6) were cancelled. Instead of these two circular routes, line 6 now goes through Borgir, Víkur and Barðastaðir and back to Spöngin for an increased frequency in Borgir, Víkur and Barðastaðir but cutting Hamrar and Rimar from the network. During weekends and late evenings, buses drive from Barðastaðir down to Grafarholt where they serve the new extended Grafarholt area and then head back to Barðastaðir and Spöngin. Also, the route of line 22 was changed for the evenings: It now runs via Álfaskleið instead of serving Skútuhraun/Slökkviðstöð back to Fjörður terminal so an hourly service in central Hafnarfjörður can be provided.\n\nIn 2011, Strætó bs. decreased the amount of bus rides per day. Routes 2 and 5 run on weekdays only, stopping already at 6pm. In general, operating hours have been cut: Instead of midnight, buses stop operating at about 11:30 pm. The last routes now terminate at about 11:30 pm. Route 36 was abandoned and 35 now runs in a 30 minutes interval all day.\n\nBut there has also been expansion: Service on lines 23 and 28 has been improved. Although the Vífilsstaðir branch of line 23 has been abandoned, the frequency of buses to Álftanes is now every 30 minutes during rush hours and every 60 minutes during the rest of the day. On Sundays, there is a taxi service several times a day to Álftanes and one late night bus is available as taxi service all days of the week from Ásgarður.\n\nRoute 28 was expanded to meet the demands of residents from the Vatnsendi area. Instead of having to take the 30 minutes ride to Hamraborg/Kópavorgur, the bus runs now to Mjódd as well so that travelling times from Vatnsendi to connecting trunk routes have been cut by twenty minutes.\n\nIn early 2012, bus services in Southern Iceland (Suðurland) were extended. Apart from the bus services from Mjódd to Selfoss and Hveragerði, one can now take buses to Þorlákshöfn, the Laugarvatn area, Vík í Mýrdal/Skógar, Skaftafell and Höfn í Hornafirði in southern Iceland.\n\nAs of 2017, there are plans to convert the main corridors into separated fast-lanes, so called Borgarlína, with the first segments expected to open in the 2020s.\n\n"}

He was born in Roxbury, Connecticut (then part of Woodbury) and died in Quebec. The son of Remember Baker and Tamar Warner, he was a first cousin of Ethan Allen and Seth Warner.\n\nRemember Baker, Jr. was described by a cousin as a tough, redheaded, freckle-faced young giant. He enlisted as a private in a company of provincial troops in 1755. In 1757, he was stationed at Fort William Henry, at the head of Lake George, and during that year participated in battles which went badly for the provincial troops.\n\nIn 1758, he enlisted a second time in the expedition of General Abercrombie in his attempted invasion of Canada, then held by the French. He was part of a band of 100 men under command of Major Putnam and accompanied by Lord Howe that went on a scouting expedition. They were surprised by a party of 500 of the enemy and Lord Howe was killed. Putnam and Baker and their men cut their way through the French ranks, charged them in the rear, and after being reinforced killed 300 of the enemy and captured 143 prisoners. Baker received honorable mention in the report of the commanding general. He remained in the service until the close of the year 1759.\n\nHe and Desire Hurlbut were married in Roxbury on April 3, 1760. In 1764, Remember, Desire and their small son Ozi moved to Arlington, now in Vermont, and built a grist mill. This was in response to an offer of from the town to anyone who would start a mill there. This mill burned down in 1789; a mill built in the 1790s is still there. Remember’s cousins Ethan Allen and Ira Allen also settled in Arlington. Remember Baker was the first town clerk of Arlington.\n\nThe Bakers and the Allens were involved in the controversy over the title of the settlers of Vermont to their land, and Baker became a captain in one of the companies of the Green Mountain Boys. Remember is said to have been more hot headed than the Allens and Seth Warner. Following attacks on those loyal to New York, the Governor of New York offered an award for the capture of Ethan Allen, Remember Baker, and others. On March 21, 1771, men from New York under the leadership of Captain John Munro attacked Baker's mill and took Baker away as a prisoner. In the fight, Baker lost a thumb and his wife injured her arm jumping out of a window. She never fully recovered the use of that arm. Remember was taken across the New York border. The Green Mountain Boys rescued Baker and returned him to his family.\n\nBy May, 1773, Ira Allen and Remember Baker, as the Allen and Baker Land Co., owned some of virgin land along the Winooski River, near Burlington, Vermont. That year there were no roads north of Castleton, and Baker and Allen cut a road through the forest for seventy miles so that supplies could be brought in from Lake Champlain. In the summer, they settled on their land and built a log house across the river from Burlington. Ira Allen was unmarried and lived with the Bakers.\n\nRemember Baker joined Ethan Allen for the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775. He and Seth Warner met at Crown Point, New York and captured the garrison there. Following that, he served as a scout for General Phillip Schuyler in the area around St. John's, where the English troops and Native Americans were camped.\n\nAround August 19, 1775, Baker left Ticonderoga for another scouting expedition along the Richelieu River. On August 22, he was shot and killed by Indians who had taken his boat. The Indians plundered the body, cut off Baker's head, raised it upon a pole and carried it in triumph to Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, which horrified the British officers there. They bought it from the Indians and buried it, and also sent some men to the point to bury the body.\n\n"}

It is the Crawford County seat. The community is part of the Macon Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2010 census, Knoxville had a population of 69.\n\nKnoxville was founded in 1823 as seat of the newly formed Crawford County. It was incorporated as a town in 1825. The former city's municipal charter was dissolved in 1995 pursuant to a Georgia law which abolished city governments which were defunct or minimally operative.\n\nThere are three National Register of Historic Places in Knoxville, which are the Crawford County Courthouse, the Crawford County Jail, and the Georgia Post Building.\n\nThere is confusion in the topic of for whom Knoxville was named for. Historians who rely on old records and spoken tradition have pointed to General Henry Knox, who served the Continental Army under George Washington, though General Knox had no ties to the state of Georgia and had been deceased for 15 years at the time of naming (c. 1821). Some historians argue that the town was named for Hugh Knox, a stagecoach operator who delivered mail along the Federal Wire Line through the future location of Knoxville. Knox owned a half-way house, where you could rest and swap horses, called the Knox House. Since there is no solid evidence of either of these men being the namesake of the town, it is left open to the individual interpreter.\n\nOn December 23, 1822, the Georgia legislature had Crawford County's Inferior Court select a county seat and build a courthouse. Considering Knoxville was centrally located in the county and also rested along the Federal Wire Road, it was decided. On December 10, 1823, Knoxville became the county seat. The house of a local resident was used as a temporary courthouse until a permanent one was built, which happened c. 1825. But, in an apparent act of arson, the courthouse was leveled in 1830, destroying all court and county records. A second courthouse was completed in 1831, which still stands today as a museum and home to the Crawford County Historical Society. In 1832 a jail was built in Knoxville, yet was torn down in 1839 due to a grand jury presentment declaring that this jail was not fit for use. Therefore, in 1843, another jail was brought up, though, in 1887, this jail, now 44 years old, was declared unfit for use and yet again torn down. A third jail was complete by 1888, standing to this day.\n\nOn January 2, 1827, Knoxville Academy opened, the town's first school. In 1888 the \"Knoxville Journal\" began print. Publisher Percy V. Howell printed advertisements for property in the yet to be named Roberta, which was speculated to become a boomtown. Yet, by 1892, the Crawford County Herald was the official newspaper of Crawford County, and was published in Roberta rather than Knoxville. Knoxville's population by c. 1886 was around 200, but was expected to increase to 3,000.\nThe A&F Railroad, also known as the Atlanta and Hawkinsville Railroad, missed Knoxville to the southwest by about one mile. This is believed to be the result of local opposition of out- of- state intruders penetrating Knoxville. A new railroad station began boiling around this time, which would later become Roberta. Inhabitants of Knoxville began the one mile shift to Roberta once the new railroad was completed, dooming Knoxville's growth. Thenceforth, Knoxville was merely a community that held the title of county seat.\n\nIn 1993 the Georgia Legislature passed a law detailing the minimum requirements for a city to remain incorporated in Georgia, resulting, in 1995, to Knoxville becoming unincorporated.\n\nKnoxville is located in central Crawford County and is bordered to the west by the city of Roberta, the only incorporated place in the county. U.S. Route 80 passes through Knoxville, leading east to Macon.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Knoxville CDP has an area of , all land.\n\n\n<br>\n"}

{"id": "2260806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260806", "title": "Battle of Fort Cumberland (1776)", "text": "Battle of Fort Cumberland (1776)\n\nThe Battle of Fort Cumberland (also known as the Eddy Rebellion) was an attempt by a small number of militia commanded by Jonathan Eddy to bring the American Revolutionary War to Nova Scotia in late 1776. With minimal logistical support from Massachusetts and four to five hundred volunteer militia and Natives, Eddy attempted to besiege and storm Fort Cumberland in central Nova Scotia (near the present-day border between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) in November 1776.\n\nThe fort's defenders, the Royal Fencible American Regiment led by Joseph Goreham, a veteran of the French and Indian War, successfully repelled several attempts by Eddy's militia to storm the fort, and the siege was ultimately relieved when the RFA plus Royal Marine reinforcements drove off the besiegers on November 29. In retaliation for the role of locals who supported the siege, numerous homes and farms were destroyed, and Patriot sympathizers were driven out of the area. The successful defense of Fort Cumberland preserved the territorial integrity of the British Maritime possessions, and Nova Scotia remained loyal throughout the war.\n\nNova Scotia was generally poorly defended in the early stages of the American Revolutionary War, and unrest in the eastern regions provoked fears of an American-led uprising. Although some reinforcements had reached Halifax by early 1776, the frontiers of the province were only lightly defended.\n\nFort Cumberland was located on the Isthmus of Chignecto, which connects modern mainland Nova Scotia with New Brunswick. The area was strategically important in earlier conflicts between the French colony of Acadia and British-controlled Nova Scotia. Originally built by the French in 1750 as Fort Beauséjour, Fort Cumberland was in deplorable condition. Won from the French in the Battle of Fort Beauséjour in 1755, the fortifications had been minimally garrisoned by the British after the Seven Years' War and abandoned in 1768.\nAs early as June 1775, Colonel Joseph Goreham had been ordered by General Thomas Gage to raise the Royal Fencible American Regiment of Foot and natives in Nova Scotia for the defense of the province against Patriot activity. Arriving at the fort in the summer of 1776, Colonel Goreham and a garrison of 200 Loyalist troops of the RFA did what they could to restore the premises to a defensible condition. But Goreham had not been adequately provisioned and his men lacked everything from victuals to uniforms. Furthermore, the locals were generally sympathetic to the Patriot cause, and refused to assist in rehabilitating the fort, even trying to induce members of the garrison to defect.\n\nJonathan Eddy was a Massachusetts-born resident of Cumberland County, Nova Scotia, where the fort was located. He and John Allan, both of whom served in the provincial assembly, were the prime movers of Patriot activity in the area, which was one of several hotbeds of agitation in Nova Scotia. The other major areas of Patriot activity were Maugerville in the St. John River valley of Sunbury County (present-day New Brunswick), and Cobequid, and there were also pockets of activity in Pictou and the Passamaquoddy Bay area, which separates present-day Maine and New Brunswick. Patriots in these communities were in contact with each other, and those of Cumberland and Maugerville were active in trying to interest nearby natives (Passamaquoddy, Maliseet, and Mi'kmaq) in their cause.\nEddy believed that with military assistance from the Thirteen Colonies, he might be able to bring down the strongly Loyalist administration of Nova Scotia. Early in 1776, Eddy went to Massachusetts in an attempt to interest political and military leaders there in supporting action in Nova Scotia, while Allan worked to raise interest in Nova Scotia. Allan's work was made more difficult by the arrival of Colonel Goreham and his troops to refortify Fort Cumberland, and by the activities of Michael Francklin, a former Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia and a vocal Loyalist. Eddy returned empty-handed to Nova Scotia in June 1776, only to learn that Goreham had put a price on his head. The activities of Goreham's Fencibles in the Cumberland area were successful enough that Patriot activities there were effectively forced underground; the center of these activities was shifted to Maugerville in part as a consequence of this. Goreham, a veteran of the French and Indian War, was also able to blunt Patriot inroads in the native communities, where the Mi'kmaq refused to take sides, and the Maliseet and Passamaquoddy, at first supportive of the Patriots, ultimately did not turn out in the numbers Eddy had hoped for or been promised.\n\nEddy returned to Massachusetts in August. While the Second Continental Congress and George Washington would not authorize, fund, or otherwise support military activities in Nova Scotia, Eddy was able to convince the Massachusetts Provincial Congress to provide some material support (primarily muskets, ammunition, powder, and other military supplies) for an attempt on Fort Cumberland. It also allowed Eddy to engage in recruiting in the District of Maine.\n\nEddy left Boston in September and sailed to Machias, where he recruited about 20 men. On October 13, this party sailed from Machias for Passamaquoddy Bay. Coincidentally, John Allan, who was working on a longer-term plan for military action, sailed from Campobello Island for Machias the same day. The two parties met at sea, where Allan attempted to dissuade Eddy from his plan, informing him that the Mi'kmaq (the largest tribe in Nova Scotia) would not help him. Allan extracted a promise from Eddy to wait at Campobello while he went to Machias to meet with the council there. When the Machias council learned of how little native support there was, they sent a letter to Eddy urging him to give up the effort. Eddy persisted, and left Campobello, having added nine Passamaquoddy recruits to his band.\n\nFrom Campobello, Eddy sailed up the Saint John River to Maugerville, where 27 men were recruited, and then up to the Maliseet settlement at Aukpaque (just upriver from present-day Fredericton). There he learned the bad news that Pierre Tomah, the main Maliseet chief, was not interested in taking up the hatchet. Eddy was able to convince Ambroise St. Aubin, one of Tomah's competitors, and 15 men to join the expedition in exchange for an agreement with the Maugerville community to support the families of those men. In another disappointment, none of the local Acadians joined, contrary to assertions St. Aubin had made to Eddy during a previous visit to the area.\n\nWith a force now numbering about 72, Eddy sailed up the Bay of Fundy to Shepody Outpost. The exact location of this outpost, established probably by Joseph Goreham in September, is subject to debate. It may have been present-day Hopewell Cape, New Brunswick on the Bay's western side, or it may have been Fort Folly Point on its eastern side. In any case, it was there that Eddy captured a patrol of Goreham's Fencibles on October 25, killing one and wounding another. The prisoners were shipped back to Machias, and Eddy sent some of his men to Cocagne in a largely fruitless effort to enlist Mi'kmaqs in the cause. Eddy himself continued on to Memramcook, where about two dozen of the Acadian locals joined him. This enlarged force marched to Sackville, where more settlers joined the force, swelling it (by Eddy's account) to about 180 men. Goreham was finally alerted to Eddy's actions on November 4, when a boat sent with supplies for the Shepody patrol was informed of Eddy's activities by locals. Goreham heightened the guard on the fort, but did not immediately attempt to notify Halifax or Windsor, since he was uncertain what routes away from the fort might have been blocked by Eddy.\n\nOn October 31, the frigate \"Juno\" escorted the supply sloop \"Polly\" to Fort Cumberland, where she docked below the fort on the Aulac River. \"Polly\" was laden with supplies to last the fort through the winter, and work began immediately to unload those supplies. \"Juno\", easily visible from Sackville, was a concern to Eddy, since her presence added to the fort's defenses. Fortunately for Eddy, she sailed on November 3, leaving \"Polly\" docked below the fort. On November 6, Eddy's patrols began ranging closer to the fort, alerting Goreham to the approaching force. Goreham took no additional steps to protect \"Polly\", and any attempts to get word of his predicament out were again delayed by his decision to await the return of scouts he had dispatched earlier. (The fate of the scouts is uncertain; they did not return before the fort was invested.) That evening, thirty of Eddy's men surprised the sleepy guards aboard \"Polly\", taking thirteen prisoners. They also seized another ship, owned by a Patriot sympathizer, that happened to be anchored nearby.\n\nOn the morning of November 7 Goreham decided that it was time to get a message to Windsor. He sent a party of men down to the dock that morning. These men, numbering about 30, were taken prisoner by Eddy's men as rapidly as they arrived due to their unawareness that Eddy had control of the ship. \"Polly\" was then sailed to Fort Lawrence, to the east of Fort Cumberland, where the supplies were landed. Sentries in the fort spotted the move, and Goreham, realizing Eddy had taken the ship, fired an ineffectual cannonade against the ship.\n\nGoreham took stock of his situation. Nearly one quarter of his garrison (more than 60 men) had been captured by Eddy, along with critical fuel and other supplies that had not been unloaded from the \"Polly\" before her seizure. His defenses consisted of a hastily constructed palisade that encompassed most of the fort, and six cannon, for which his men had only completed three mounts. The fort's military complement was 176 men, including officers and artillerymen. Over the next few days, local militia arrived to raise the garrison's size to about 200, although this included individuals not effective for combat due to illness. On both November 7 and 8 he again attempted to get messengers out of Eddy's cordon, without success.\n\nOn November 8 Eddy was joined by about 200 men from Cobequid and Pictou, and he finally felt ready to act on November 10. Eddy sent a letter demanding that Goreham surrender his garrison. Goreham refused, suggesting in retort that Eddy surrender.\n\nThe next day authorities outside the area learned of Eddy's activities. Michael Francklin, patrolling in the Bay of Fundy for privateers, recovered a ferry that had been taken, and learned from its passengers that Eddy was active. When the news reached Halifax through the efforts of Thomas Dixson, Lieutenant Governor Marriot Arbuthnot responded by dispatching orders on the 15th for any available ship based at Annapolis to go to Fort Edward in Windsor, to convoy troops to relieve the siege.\n\nCommodore Sir George Collier had previously dispatched HMS \"Vulture\" into the Bay of Fundy on rumors of privateering activity there, so he ordered HMS \"Hope\" to locate \"Vulture\" so that she could assist. However, \"Hope\" captured a prize and returned to Halifax; she was then sent out again to accompany a supply ship to Fort Cumberland. In the meantime, \"Vulture\" fortuitously arrived at Windsor, where she took on some marines and Fencibles.\n\nLacking artillery, the rebels attempted to storm the fort on the night of November 12, attempting a feint to draw Goreham's strength away from the weak points of the defenses. The experienced Goreham saw through the feint and repulsed the attack. One of Eddy's Maliseet warriors sneaked into the fort and very nearly opened a gate but was stopped at the last moment. Following the failed attack, Eddy effectively lost control of the expedition, as a council of leaders formed against him. Night attacks ordered by the council on November 22 and 23 succeeded in capturing and burning several buildings, but Goreham grimly held his ground, and the invaders were again repulsed.\n\nOn November 27, \"Vulture\" arrived. Rather than retreat in the face of arriving relief, the rebels increased their guard; Goreham, with some intelligence about the size of the force opposing him, planned a sortie. Early on the morning of November 29, Major Thomas Batt led 150 men from \"Vulture\"s Royal Marine contingent and the Royal Fencible Americans, and scattered Eddy's men, killing and wounding several, at the cost of two dead and three wounded.\n\nBatt's men chased Eddy's, but bad weather and the lack of adequate footwear eventually caused him to call off the pursuit. Eddy's forces scattered, with many retreating overland to Maugerville. Some of the Massachusetts men took more than two months to reach Machias. Homes and farms of rebel supporters were burned in reprisal but British authorities took a lenient approach toward captured rebels, including Richard John Uniacke, who went on to become Attorney General of Nova Scotia. Goreham issued an offer of pardon for those who would surrender their arms, which more than 100 locals accepted. This prompted Major Batt to file charges against Goreham for neglect of duty; Goreham was exonerated.\n\nThe victory at Fort Cumberland strengthened the British presence in Nova Scotia, in part by driving Patriot sympathizers like Allan and Eddy out of the province, but also by cowing those that remained, often by requiring people to make pledges to the Crown. Some unrest continued for the remainder of the war (e.g., the Battle at Miramichi), although no further large scale military threat occurred. The most significant attempt occurred in the summer of 1777, when John Allan was authorized by Congress to take actions in Nova Scotia; however, only a small number of forces were raised for this effort at Saint John, and a British show of force put an end to the attempt. Eddy appears to have been involved with Allan's work, but his movements prior to August 1777 are uncertain. Commodore Collier followed up by attacking Machias, intending to break Allan's plans. Eddy led the defense of Machias during the battle on August 13–15, 1777. (Collier's action was in fact unnecessary; the Massachusetts Provisional Congress had in early August voted to disband forces recruited for Allan's expedition, because of the imminent threat posed by the army of General John Burgoyne in upstate New York.)\n\nThe Battle of Fort Cumberland was poorly documented in 19th-century histories of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, often receiving only minimal mention. The involvement of local inhabitants (natives, Acadians, and English-speakers) in the siege was generally understated or unknown. The site of Fort Cumberland has been preserved as a National Historic Site of Canada, and is administered by Parks Canada.\n\n\n\nThomas H.

Over the course of his career, he had composed music for over 100 Hindi films. Just a day after he turned 51, he died of cancer in Kokilaben Hospital.\n\nBorn in a Hindu Kayastha family in Katni, Shrivastava got his first big break with the film \"Kanyadaan\" in 1993. Among the singers who sang in this movie, there was Lata Mangeshkar who sang his first song - Oh Sajna Dilbar, a duet with Udit Narayan, which became popular on the radio. But the film and the rest of the songs went unnoticed. The same thing happened with \"Jaane Tamanna\", but he bounced back with \"Aao Pyaar Karen\". One track \"Haathon Mein Aa Gaya Jo Kal\" was a hit. His other films are \"Salma Pe Dil Aa Gaya\" and \"Shastra\".

The popular series ran for nine seasons and was successfully screened internationally.\n\nIt was initially a 1985 mini-series based in the fictional outback town of Cooper's Crossing (set in the real life town of Minyip in north-western rural Victoria). The success of the mini-series led to its return the following year as an ongoing series with McFarlane being joined by a new doctor, Chris Randall, played by Liz Burch. McFarlane left during the first season, and actor Robert Grubb arrived as new doctor Geoff Standish. McFarlane later returned to the series, resuming his role.\n\nThe series' episodes were mostly self-contained and about medical items. The Australian society was mirrored in handling more or less controversial social problems as the abuse of women within marriage, alcohol abuse, and the position of the aboriginals. It also featured ongoing storylines, such as Dr. Standish's romance with Sister Kate Wellings (Lenore Smith). Other major characters included pilot Sam Patterson (Peter O'Brien), mechanic Emma Plimpton (Rebecca Gibney), local policeman Sgt.

He was known for his individualistic and personal interpretations and was praised for his tone color, expressiveness, and flexibility. The \"Gibson ex-Huberman Stradivarius\" violin which bears his name was stolen and recovered twice during the period in which he owned the instrument. Huberman is also remembered for founding the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra (then known as the Palestine Philharmonic) and thus providing refuge from the Third Reich for nearly 1,000 European Jews.\n\nHuberman was born in Częstochowa, Poland. In his youth he was a pupil of Mieczysław Michałowicz and Maurycy Rosen at the Warsaw Conservatory, and of Isidor Lotto in Paris. In 1892 he studied under Joseph Joachim in Berlin. Despite being only ten years old, he dazzled Joachim with performances of Louis Spohr, Henri Vieuxtemps, and the transcription of a Frédéric Chopin nocturne. However, the two did not get along well, and after Huberman's fourteenth birthday he took no more lessons. In 1893 he toured the Netherlands and Belgium as a virtuoso performer. Around this time, the six-year-old Arthur Rubinstein attended one of Huberman's concerts. Rubinstein's parents invited Huberman back to their house and the two boys struck up what would become a lifetime friendship. In 1894 Adelina Patti invited Huberman to participate in her farewell gala in London, which he did, and in the following year he actually eclipsed her in appearances in Vienna. In 1896 he performed the violin concerto of Johannes Brahms in the presence of the composer, who was stunned by the quality of his playing.\n\nHe married the German actress Elza Galafrés (also described as a singer and ballerina). They had a son, Johannes, but the marriage did not last. She later met the Hungarian composer and pianist Ernő Dohnányi, but neither Huberman nor Dohnányi's then wife would consent to divorce. Elza and Dohnányi nevertheless had a child out of wedlock in 1917, and in 1919, after Huberman had granted her a divorce, she married Dohnányi, who then adopted Huberman's son Johannes.\n\nIn the 1920s and early 1930s, Huberman toured around Europe and North America with the pianist Siegfried Schultze and performed on the most famous stages (Carnegie in New York, Scala in Milan, Musikverein in Vienna, Konzerthaus in Berlin...). Over the course of many years, the duet Huberman-Schultze were regularly invited in private by European Royal Families. Countless recordings of these artists were done during that period at the \"Berliner Rundfunk\" and were unfortunately destroyed during the Second World War.\n\nIn 1937, a year before the Anschluss, Huberman left Vienna and took refuge in Switzerland. The following year, his career nearly ended as a result of an airplane accident in Sumatra in which his wrist and two fingers of his left hand were broken. After intensive and painful retraining he was able to resume performing. At the onset of the Second World War, Huberman was touring South Africa and was unable to return to his home in Switzerland until after the war. Shortly thereafter he fell ill from exhaustion and never regained his strength. He died in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland, on June 16, 1947, at age 64.\n\nIn 1929 Huberman first visited Palestine and developed his vision of establishing classical music in the Promised Land. In 1933, during the Nazis' rise to power, Huberman declined invitations from Wilhelm Furtwängler to return to preach a \"musical peace\", but wrote instead an open letter to German intellectuals inviting them to remember their essential values. In 1936 he founded the \"Palestine Symphony Orchestra\" (which upon the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 was renamed the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra). For the orchestra, Huberman recruited leading Jewish musicians from Europe, showing \"the prescience to realize that far more than a new job was at stake for these artists\" — for \"if it hadn't been for Huberman, dozens of musicians and their families — nearly 1000 people in all — would nearly certainly have died if they had stayed in countries including Germany, Austria, Poland and Hungary.\" He was assisted by violinist Jacob Surowicz. Conductor William Steinberg, then known as Hans Wilhelm Steinberg, trained the orchestra. The first concert, on December 26, 1936 was conducted by Arturo Toscanini; Huberman had invited the Italian maestro when he heard of his refusing to perform in Germany to protest the Nazi takeover. The 2012 documentary film \"Orchestra of Exiles\" by writer, director and producer Josh Aronson recreates Huberman's work creating the orchestra through interviews and reenactments. Featuring interviews with Zubin Mehta, Pinchas Zukerman, Joshua Bell, and many other notable musicians, the film details how Huberman rescued nearly 1000 Jewish musicians and their families and created the Palestine Symphony Orchestra. The film also details how famous Jews and leading historical figures, such as Albert Einstein, were vital in creating the orchestra.\n\nBefore 1936, Huberman's principal instrument for his concerts was a 1713-vintage Stradivarius \"Gibson,\" which was named after one of its early owners, the English violinist George Alfred Gibson. It was stolen twice. In 1919, it was taken from Huberman's Vienna hotel room, but recovered by the police within 3 days. The second time was in New York City. On February 28, 1936, while giving a concert at Carnegie Hall, Huberman switched the Stradivarius \"Gibson\" with his newly acquired Guarnerius violin, leaving the Stradivarius in his dressing room during intermission. It was stolen either by New York City nightclub musician Julian Altman or a friend of his. Altman kept the violin for the next half century. Huberman's insurance company, Lloyd's of London, paid him US$30,000 for the loss in 1936.\n\nAltman went on to become a violinist with the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, D.C. and performed with the stolen Stradivarius for many years. In 1985, Altman made a deathbed confession to his wife, Marcelle Hall, that he had stolen the violin. Two years later, she returned it to Lloyd's and collected a finder's fee of US$263,000. The instrument underwent a 9-month restoration by J & A Beare Ltd., in London. In 1988, Lloyd's sold it for US$1.2 million to British violinist Norbert Brainin. In October 2001, the American violinist Joshua Bell purchased it for just under US$4,000,000. \n\nThe instrument, which is now known as the Gibson-Huberman, was the focus of the 2012 documentary \"The Return of the Violin\" by the Israeli television director Haim Hecht which featured interviews with musicians such as Joshua Bell, Zubin Mehta, Holocaust-survivor Sigmund Rolat and many other musicians.\n\nThe town of Częstochowa renamed its orchestra as the \"Bronislaw Huberman Philharmonic\" in honor of its native violinist.\n\nHuberman made several commercial recordings of large-scale works, among which are:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2260854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260854", "title": "Divide and choose", "text": "Divide and choose\n\nDivide and choose (also Cut and choose or I cut, you choose) is a procedure for envy-free cake-cutting between two partners. It involves a heterogeneous good or resource (\"the cake\") and two partners who have different preferences over parts of the cake. The protocol proceeds as follows: one person (\"the cutter\") cuts the cake into two pieces; the other person (\"the chooser\") chooses one of the pieces; the cutter receives the remaining piece.\n\nDivide and choose is mentioned in the Bible, in the Book of Genesis (chapter 13). When Abraham and Lot come to the land of Canaan, Abraham suggests that they divide it among them. Then Abraham, coming from the south, divides the land to a \"left\" (western) part and a \"right\" (eastern) part, and lets Lot choose. Lot chooses the eastern part which contains Sodom and Gomorrah, and Abraham is left with the western part which contains Beer Sheva, Hebron, Beit El, and Shechem.\n\nDivide and choose is envy-free in the following sense: each of the two partners can act in a way that guarantees that, according to their own subjective taste, their allocated share is at least as valuable as the other share, regardless of what the other partner does. Here is how each partner can act:\n\nTo an external viewer, the division might seem unfair, but to the two involved partners, the division is fair—no partner envies the other.\n\nIf the value functions of the partners are additive functions, then divide and choose is also proportional in the following sense: each partner can act in a way that guarantees that their allocated share has a value of at least 1/2 of the total cake value. This is because, with additive valuations, every envy-free division is also proportional.\n\nThe protocol works both for dividing a desirable resource (as in fair cake-cutting) and for dividing an undesirable resource (as in chore division).\n\nDivide and choose assumes that the parties have equal entitlements and wish to decide the division themselves or use mediation rather than arbitration. The goods are assumed to be divisible in any way, but each party may value the bits differently.\n\nThe cutter has an incentive to divide as fairly as possible: if they do not, they will likely receive an undesirable portion. This rule is a concrete application of the veil of ignorance concept.\n\nThe divide and choose method does not guarantee that each person gets exactly half the cake by their own valuations, and so is not an exact division. There is no finite procedure for exact division, but it can be done using two moving knives; see Austin moving-knife procedure.\n\nDivide and choose might produce inefficient allocations.\n\nOne commonly used example is a cake that is half vanilla and half chocolate. Suppose Bob likes only chocolate, and Carol only vanilla. If Bob is the cutter and he is unaware of Carol's preference, his safe strategy is to divide the cake so that each half contains an equal amount of chocolate. But then, regardless of Carol's choice, Bob gets only half the chocolate, and the allocation is clearly not Pareto efficient. It is entirely possible that Bob, in his ignorance, would put all the vanilla (and some amount of chocolate) in one larger portion, so Carol gets everything she wants while he would receive less than what he could have gotten by negotiating.\n\nIf Bob knew Carol's preference and liked her, he could cut the cake into an all-chocolate piece and an all-vanilla piece, Carol would choose the vanilla piece, and Bob would get all the chocolate. On the other hand, if he doesn't like Carol, he can cut the cake into slightly more than half vanilla in one portion and the rest of the vanilla and all the chocolate in the other. Carol might also be motivated to take the portion with the chocolate to spite Bob. There is a procedure to solve even this, but it is very unstable in the face of a small error in judgement. More practical solutions that can't guarantee optimality but are much better than divide and choose have been devised by Steven Brams and Alan Taylor, in particular the adjusted winner procedure (AW).\n\nIn 2006, Steven J. Brams, Michael A. Jones, and Christian Klamler detailed a new way to cut a cake called the surplus procedure (SP) that satisfies \"equitability\" and so solves the above problem. Both people's subjective valuation of their piece as a proportion of the whole is the same.\n\nMartin Gardner popularized the problem of designing a similarly fair procedure for larger groups in his May 1959 \"Mathematical Games column\" in \"Scientific American\". One procedure begins with one person cutting what they consider a fair share. Anyone can then trim it down to be smaller. But whoever is the last person to trim it has to take it.\n\nA newer method is reported in Scientific America. It was developed by Aziz and Mackenzie.\nWhile faster in principle than the earlier method, it is still potentially very slow: \"O\"(\"n\"), where \"n\" is the number of divisions desired.\n\n"}

She has co-written nine books with her late husband Jerry Hicks, presented numerous workshops on the law of attraction with Abraham Hicks Publications and appeared in the original version of the 2006 film \"The Secret\". The Hicks' books, including the series \"The Law of Attraction\", are — according to Esther Hicks — \"translated from a group of non-physical entities called Abraham.\" Hicks describes what she is doing as tapping into \"infinite intelligence\".\n\nEsther Weaver was born in Coalville, Utah on March 5, 1948. She married Jerry Hicks, then a successful Amway distributor. In his early life Jerry Hicks had been a circus acrobat for two years in Cuba, and then, beginning in 1948, had toured for 20 years as a musician, MC, and comedian. Esther has one daughter, Tracy, by her former marriage. Jerry Hicks died November 18th, 2011 from cancer. He was 85 years old.\n\nAccording to Esther and Jerry Hicks, \"Abraham\" consists of a group of entities that are \"interpreted\" by Esther Hicks. Abraham has described themselves as \"a group consciousness from the non-physical dimension\". They have also said, \"We are that which you are. You are the leading edge of that which we are. We are that which is at the heart of all religions.\" Abraham has said through Esther that, whenever one feels moments of great love, exhilaration, or pure joy, that is the energy of source and that is who Abraham is.\n\nEsther herself calls Abraham \"infinite intelligence\", and to Jerry, they are \"the purest form of love I've ever experienced\". Her teachings (known as \"Abraham–Hicks teachings\") are based on this experience. The basic tenets of the teachings include one that says that people create their own reality through their attention and focus. Emotions are a person's guidance system that indicates how close or distant that person is to how their Source feels about a particular topic of focus. Life is meant to be fun and easy. The essence of Abraham–Hicks' teachings since 1986 has been presented as follows:\n\n\nA large part of Hicks' work centers around the law of attraction, a concept which William Walker Atkinson (1862–1932) wrote about in his book \"Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction in the Thought World\" (1906).\n\nEsther Hicks narrated and appeared in the original version of the film \"The Secret\", as well as being a central source of the film's inspiration. The footage featuring Hicks was removed from the later \"Extended Edition\" after the film's creator Rhonda Byrne, who has been involved in contractual disputes and litigation regarding the film, rescinded the original contract covering Hicks' participation, and asked that Hicks relinquish her \"intellectual property rights in these areas forever\". In an open letter posted on the internet, Hicks stated that she had been \"uncomfortable with what felt to us like a rather aggressive marketing campaign,\" and that ultimately Abraham gave her the following advice: \"Whenever you are given an ultimatum that says, 'if you don't do this, then we will have to do such and such,' it is best that you just let it go and move on. Otherwise there is always another, and this, and this, and this.\" The letter doesn't condemn Byrne, but clarifies why Hicks no longer appears in \"The Secret\".\n\nHicks has since posted a video on YouTube further explaining her discomfort with \"The Secret\" and finally, her decision to discontinue involvement with the film.\n\nHay House, Inc. published the Hicks' book, \"Ask and it is Given\", in September 2004. Since that book they have also published \"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent\" (January 2006), \"The Law of Attraction\" (October 2006), \"The Astonishing Power of Emotions\" (September 2008), \"Money and the Law of Attraction: Learning to Attract Health, Wealth & Happiness,\" and \"The Vortex: Where the Law of Attraction Assembles All Cooperative Relationships\" (2009). A series of fictional children's books, \"Sara I\", \"II\", and \"III\", is also available. Several of their books have been translated into Spanish, French, Italian, German, Dutch, Swedish, Czech, Croatian, Slovenian, Slovak, Serbian, Romanian, Russian and Japanese.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2260875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260875", "title": "The North Wind and the Sun", "text": "The North Wind and the Sun\n\nThe North Wind and the Sun is one of Aesop's Fables (Perry Index 46). It is type 298 (Wind and Sun) in the Aarne-Thompson folktale classification. The moral it teaches about the superiority of persuasion over force has made the story widely known. It has also become a chosen text for phonetic transcriptions.\n\nThe story concerns a competition between the North Wind and the Sun to decide which is the stronger of the two. The challenge was to make a passing traveler remove his cloak. However hard the North Wind blew, the traveler only wrapped his cloak tighter to keep warm, but when the Sun shone, the traveler was overcome with heat and soon took his cloak off.\n\nThe fable was well known in Ancient Greece; Athenaeus records that Hieronymus of Rhodes, in his \"Historical Notes\", quoted an epigram of Sophocles against Euripides that parodied the story of Helios and Boreas. It related how Sophocles had his cloak stolen by a boy to whom he had made love. Euripides joked that he had had that boy too, and it did not cost him anything. Sophocles' reply satirises the adulteries of Euripides:\n\"It was the Sun, and not a boy, whose heat stripped me naked;\nas for you, Euripides, when you were kissing someone else's wife\nthe North Wind screwed \"you\". You are unwise, you who sow\nin another's field, to accuse Eros of being a snatch-thief.\"\n\nThe Latin version of the fable first appeared centuries later in Avianus, as \"De Vento et Sole\" (Of the wind and the sun, Fable 4); early versions in English and Johann Gottfried Herder's poetic version in German (\"Wind und Sonne\") also gave it as such. It was only in mid-Victorian times that the title \"The North Wind and the Sun\" began to be used. In fact, the Avianus poem refers to the characters as Boreas and Phoebus, the divinities of the north wind and the sun, and it was under the title \"Phébus et Borée\" that it appeared in La Fontaine's Fables.\n\nGilles Corrozet, who had compiled a fable collection in French verse earlier than La Fontaine, twice featured the contest between the sun and the wind in his emblem books. In \"Hecatomgraphie\" (1540), the first of these, the story is told in a quatrain, accompanied by a woodcut in which a man holds close a fur cloak under the wintry blast while on the other side he strips naked beneath the sun's rays. It is titled with the moral “More by gentleness than strength” (\"Plus par doulceur que par force\"). The same illustration was used to accompany another poem in Corrozet's later \"Emblemes\" (1543), which counsels taking enjoyment and being careful as necessity demands, wisely adapting oneself to circumstances in the same way as one dresses differently for winter than for summer.\n\nVictorian versions of the fable give the moral as \"Persuasion is better than force\", but it had been put in different ways at other times. In the Barlow edition of 1667, Aphra Behn taught the Stoic lesson that there should be moderation in everything: \"In every passion moderation choose, For all extremes do bad effects produce\". In the 18th century, Herder came to the theological conclusion that, while superior force leaves us cold, the warmth of Christ's love dispels it, and Walter Crane's limerick version of 1887 gives a psychological interpretation, \"True strength is not bluster\". But for Guy Wetmore Carryl in his humorous rewriting of the fable, \"The Impetuous Breeze and the Diplomatic Sun\", tact is the lesson to be learned. There the competition is between the man and the wind; the sun only demonstrates the right way of achieving one's end.\n\nWhile most examples draw a moral lesson, La Fontaine's \"Mildness more than violence achieves\" (\"Fables\" VI.3) hints at the political application that was present also in Avianus' conclusion: \"They cannot win who start with threats\". There is evidence that this reading has had an explicit influence on the diplomacy of modern times: in South Korea's Sunshine Policy, for instance, or Japanese relations with the military regime in Myanmar.\n\nJean Restout made a painting of La Fontaine's fable for the Hôtel de Soubise in 1738. This showed a traveller on horseback among mountains under a stormy sky. In his print of the same subject, Jean-Baptiste Oudry reversed the perspective to show the god riding a cloud chariot with the horseback traveller merely a small figure below. This too was the perspective of Gustave Moreau's 1879 watercolour in the series he painted of the fables. In modern times, the fable has been made into a 3-minute animated film for children by the National Film Board of Canada (1972). It also figured as part of a 1987 set of Greek stamps.\nThe fable was the third of five in Anthony Plog's \"Aesop’s Fables\" for narrator, piano and horn (1989/93); it is also one of the five pieces in Bob Chilcott's \"Aesop's Fables\" for piano and choir (2008). And, under the title \"The Wind and the Sun\", the English composer Philip Godfrey (b.1964) has made a setting for children's choir and piano.\n\nLa Fontaine's \"Phébus et Borée\" was choreographed in 2006 by as part of Annie Sellem's composite ballet production of La Fontaine's fables as a 25-minute performance for a male and female dancer. Its creator has commented on the fable's theme that 'it demonstrates people's vulnerability to cosmic forces and the inner links there are between natural events and our life as humans.' But for the Scottish artist Jane Topping (b. 1972), who referenced \"The North Wind and the Sun\" in her 2009 installation, the fable is to be interpreted in the context of subliminal persuasion via images.\n\nIn 2011 Anat Pollack used solo ballet as part of her video installation \"The North Wind and the Sun\", addressing much the same themes as Karine Ponties and Jane Topping. Her artistic statement points out that 'Advanced communication and information systems are altering how information is interpreted and perceived. Interactions within our environments are increasingly information based, ephemeral, and less concrete. To understand how these changes are impacting our personal and social spaces, I have focused on a study of information processing, and the way that memory functions to locate the individual within their world.' All are concerned with the subtle means by which individuals can be manipulated. From this wary point of view, the sun's way of communication may differ in kind but has the same end in view.\n\n The fable is made famous by its use in phonetic descriptions of languages as an illustration of spoken language. In the \"Handbook of the International Phonetic Association\" and the \"Journal of the International Phonetic Association\", a translation of the fable into each language described is transcribed into the International Phonetic Alphabet. It is recommended by the IPA for the purpose of eliciting all phonemic contrasts that occur in English when conducting tests by foreign users or of regional usage. For example, the description of American English in the \"Handbook of the International Phonetic Association\" includes the following as a sample text:\n\n\n\n\nThe fable has also been proposed as a parallel text in comparative linguistics as it provides more natural language than the Lord's Prayer. In addition, impromptu tellings can indicate differences within languages such as dialects or national varieties. The example above, for instance, has \"shined\" where British English usage is \"shone\". The previous IPA handbook transcribed \"shone\" for the Southern British and Scottish versions, but \"began to shine\" for the American English version. For an illustration of New Zealand English, the fable was replaced by \"The Southerly Wind and the Sun\" to make it geographically appropriate.\n\n"}
{"id": "2260883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260883", "title": "Ahmed Zaki Yamani", "text": "Ahmed Zaki Yamani\n\nAhmed Zaki Yamani (; born 30 June 1930) is a Saudi Arabian politician who was Minister of Oil (Petroleum) and Mineral Resources from 1962 to 1986, and a minister in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) for 25 years.\n\nWith degrees from various institutions including New York University School of Law, Harvard Law School, and a doctorate from the University of Exeter, Yamani became a close adviser to the Saudi government in 1958 and then became oil minister in 1962. He is best known for his role during the 1973 oil embargo, when he spurred OPEC to quadruple the price of crude oil. During that time, Yamani gained a colourful international reputation, known in the West for both diplomatic skills and his characteristic goatee.\n\nIn December 1975, Yamani and the other OPEC ministers were taken hostage by notorious terrorist Carlos (the Jackal) in Vienna, Austria. The hostages were released after two days riding an airplane across North Africa, even though Carlos was ordered by his superiors to execute Yamani and his Iranian counterpart Jamshid Amouzegar.\n\nIn October 1986, King Fahd dismissed Yamani. He also dismissed Abdulhady Hassan Taher, who was the founder of Petromin oils (now part of Aramco) and had a major role in the Saudi oil history. The reasons for this include the Saudi government's insistence on setting its own oil policy. Another reason could have been the power of the two oilmen, since they were both running the Saudi petroleum industry. In 1990, Yamani founded the Centre for Global Energy Studies, a market analysis group.\n\nZaki Yamani was born in Mecca on 30 June 1930, one of three children. His father, Hassan Yamani, was a Qadi in the Hejaz and a respected scholar of Islamic law, acting as Grand Mufti in Indonesia and Malaysia. Yamani's grandfather was Grand Mufti in Turkey. The Yamani surname originates from Yemen where his paternal ancestors came from.\n\nYamani earned a bachelor's degree in law at King Fouad I University in Cairo in 1951. Next, the Saudi government sent Yamani to New York University's Comparative Law Institute for non-American lawyers at NYU Law School and in 1955 he received a master's degree in Comparative Jurisprudence. Whilst at NYU, Yamani met his first wife, Laila, from Mosul, Iraq, and they married in the Brooklyn home of a Moroccan. With the help of an NYU professor, Yamani spent the next year at Harvard Law School earning his second Master's in 1956.\n\nYamani returned to the Saudi Ministry of Finance, joining the new Department of Zakat and Income Tax. The same year Yamani founded his own law firm sharing his name.\n\nIn 1959, Yamani was invited by Prince Faisal, then Crown Prince and Prime Minister, to work as a legal adviser to his office. However, when King Saud returned to full power in 1960 with the support of the Free Princes, Faisal resigned as Prime Minister and Yamani returned to his law practice and began teaching at the University of Riyadh. According to Yamani, King Saud then offered him the position of Oil Minister but this was declined. Several months later a new cabinet was formed with Faisal as Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister and in March 1962 the incumbent Oil Minister and founding father of OPEC, Abdullah Tariki, was replaced by Ahmed Zaki Yamani.\n\nAlthough clearly distinguished from his fiery predecessor by both his supporters and detractors, Yamani had a common goal with Tariki in moving toward the nationalisation of Aramco, the operating oil company in the country. In 1962 the General Petroleum and Mineral Organization (Petromin) was established, designed to become the national oil company. In 1964 University of Petroleum and Minerals was established, with the aim of producing Saudis with the skills to manage this company in the future. However, Yamani's plans for increased Saudi control of oil resources were only made public in 1968 during a speech at the American University in Beirut (AUB), where he talked of \"participation\" as opposed to nationalisation. Following OPEC negotiations in 1972, the Saudi government bought 25% ownership of Aramco. From 1974, Saudi participation increased to 60% and in 1976 total Saudi ownership was agreed, with payments completed in 1980.\n\nAs Oil Minister of oil-rich Saudi Arabia, Yamani took an important role in the development of the newly created OPEC. From early on, Yamani was noted as having a \"moderate\" oil policy. Faced with the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, Yamani spoke against the use of an Arab oil embargo, to the displeasure of Israel's Arab neighbours and Iraq in particular. The 1967 embargo was ineffective, although the experience led to a consideration of the possible political benefits of an Arab-only oil organisation. Yamani took the lead role in the development of this idea and in 1968 the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) was joined by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Libya. Several other countries joined in 1970 and Egypt, Syria and militant Iraq joined in the early 1970s.\n\nFollowing the humiliation of the 1967 Six-Day War, demands for the use of oil as a political weapon intensified throughout the Arab world, with the primary aim of changing the apparent pro-Israeli policy of the US government. Overwhelming pressure for Saudi Arabia to support such action resulted from the renewal of Arab-Israeli conflict on October 1973 with the Yom Kippur War. Yamani took the initiative and planned to drop oil production initially by 10 percent alongside other OPEC members, followed by 5 percent reductions each month. This proposal was designed to gain the necessary attention from the West while preventing the tremendous economic damage that could be caused by more-radical reductions likely to be advanced by other OPEC members.\n\nOn 16 October, the six Persian Gulf members of OPEC met in Kuwait and took the decision to raise oil prices from US$3 to $5.12. This was the first time the producer countries had independently set the price of their oil. On the next day, the ten OAPEC members agreed to Shiekh Yamani's moderate production cutback proposals. An embargo to countries seen as \"hostile\" was also recommended but not enforced, although by 22 October all OAPEC countries had placed an embargo on the hostile nations of the United States and the Netherlands. Those countries considered friendly would not be directly affected by either decision, although \"neutral\" countries would.\n\nThe production cutbacks, increased to 25 percent in November, severely affected the economic health of all Western powers. To gain political support, Yamani travelled through Europe, the US and Japan with Algerian oil minister Belaid Abdesselam. Both Yamani and OPEC became well known in the West for the first time, with Yamani described as \"the man of the moment\" in Newsweek International's 24 December 1973 cover article. US attempts at bringing together a consumer's cartel failed, and the EEC and Japan called on Israel to withdraw from Arab territories occupied in 1967.\n\nOn 22 December, the Persian Gulf members of OPEC met again in Tehran where the Shah, backed by the other militant states, urged that the price of oil be raised to over $20 a barrel. Yamani opposed this extreme increase but could not contact Saudi Arabia from Tehran. Fearing a split in OPEC, Yamani decided on a compromise that put oil at $11.65, four times the price of a barrel prior to 16 October.\n\nFollowing progress with Arab-Israeli disengagement agreements, a decision was taken to end the embargo, which was formally lifted on 17 March 1974.\n\nSaudi Arabia continued to push for price reductions from the $11.65 level, opposed by other OPEC members. This increasingly came to be seen as a pro-American stance by the other producers, although defended by Yamani as a safer option for the world economy. Saudi Arabia has been criticised for using its dominant position to force its own interests and its long-term production strategy, as a lower price enables the country to keep a high market share and discourages development of alternative energy sources that would curtail the worldwide demand for oil. To this point, Yamani famously said in 1973: \"The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones.\" (However, the quote may have been wrongly attributed by this and other sources.)\n\nOn 25 March 1975, King Faisal was shot dead by his nephew Faisal bin Musad. The young prince had joined a Kuwaiti delegation, led by oil minister Abdul Mutaleb Kazimi, which Yamani had escorted to the King's office. Yamani was standing next to the King when the shots were fired and, after interrogation, it was discovered that Faisal bin Musad also believed Yamani to have been shot dead in the attack.\n\nKing Faisal's death led to widespread predictions that Yamani would soon be replaced as oil minister. Faisal and Yamani are known to have had an especially strong relationship, with the King holding Yamani's opinion in high regard, even above other members of the royal family. This, along with his success before the Western media, fostered jealousy, especially amongst the Sudairi Seven and Fahd, who became Crown Prince under Faisal's frail and uninterested successor, King Khalid.\n\nYamani, however, continued in his role as oil minister for another eleven years after the death of Faisal, possibly buoyed by his prominent international position.\n\nOn 21 December 1975, Saudi Arabia's Yamani, Iran's Jamshid Amuzegar, and the other OPEC oil ministers were taken hostage at their semi-annual conference in Vienna, Austria. The attack, which killed three non-ministers, was carried out by a six-person team led by Venezuelan terrorist Carlos the Jackal which included Gabriele Kröcher-Tiedemann and Hans-Joachim Klein. The self-named \"Arm of the Arab Revolution\" group called for the liberation of Palestine. Carlos planned to take over the conference by force and hold for ransom all eleven attending oil ministers, except for Yamani and Amuzegar who were to be executed.\n\nCarlos arranged bus and plane travel for his team and 42 of the original 63 hostages, with stops in Algiers and Tripoli, planning to fly eventually to Baghdad, where Yamani and Amuzegar were to be killed. All 30 non-Arab hostages were released in Algiers, excluding Amuzegar. Additional hostages were released at another stop in Tripoli before returning to Algiers. With only 10 hostages remaining, Carlos held a phone conversation with Algerian President Houari Boumédienne, who informed Carlos that the oil ministers' deaths would result in an attack on the plane. Boumédienne must also have offered Carlos asylum at this time and possibly financial compensation for failing to complete his assignment. Carlos expressed his regret at not being able to murder Yamani and Amuzegar, then he and his comrades left the plane. All the hostages and terrorists walked away from the situation, two days after it began.\n\nSome time after the attack, Carlos's accomplices revealed that the operation was commanded by Wadie Haddad, a founder of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. They also claimed that the idea and funding came from an Arab president, widely thought to be Libya's Muammar al-Gaddafi. Fellow militants Bassam Abu Sharif and Klein claimed that Carlos received and kept a ransom between US$20 million and US$50 million from \"an Arab president\". Carlos claimed that Saudi Arabia paid ransom on behalf of Iran, but that the money was \"diverted en route and lost by the Revolution\".\n\nAt an OPEC meeting in September 1975 in Vienna, Saudi Arabia continued to oppose sharp increases in the price of oil. Yamani was required to gain approval from Crown Prince Fahd for any increase to be agreed in excess of 5%. Unable to contact Saudi Arabia from Vienna, Yamani left the meeting and flew to London on his private jet in order to find a secure telephone. This incident was widely publicized.\n\nAt an OPEC meeting in May 1976 in Bali, Iran and seven other members advocated a 20% increase in oil prices to match inflation, although Saudi Arabia favoured a six-month price freeze. The Iraqi oil minister fiercely criticised Yamani and Saudi Arabia for pro-Western policy, which led to Yamani leaving the meeting and demanding an apology. This was settled and the six-month price freeze was agreed.\n\nSix months later, OPEC assembled in Doha and Saudi Arabia again faced pressure to raise prices. Saudi Arabia and the UAE were the only two member countries not to agree to a 10% increase in January 1977 followed by an additional 5% increase in July. This led to a period of two-tier pricing with Saudi Arabia and the UAE charging $12.09 per barrel and the other OPEC countries $12.70 per barrel. In July 1977, an OPEC meeting in Stockholm ended two-tier pricing, with prices re-unified at $12.70.\n\nIn 1979, the Iranian Revolution resulted in the 1979 energy crisis. Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members managed to increase production sufficiently to replace that lost from Iran, but this did not prevent panic buying of oil. OPEC also maintained an official price, although the spot market led to oil prices being negotiated upward. Yamani claimed that Saudi Arabia would not sell over the OPEC price but would remain committed to the reduction of oil prices.\n\nThe panic buying during the 1979 energy crisis led to increased oil stocks which began to flood the market and resulted in price wars between oil-producing nations competing for market share. This in turn led to reduced income for Saudi Arabia. On 13 June 1982, in the course of this downturn, King Khalid died of a heart attack and Crown Prince Fahd became King and Prime Minister, resulting in renewed rumours of Yamani's imminent removal from office.\n\nThe beginning of Fahd's rule was marred by the reduced oil income caused by the 1980s oil glut, and ambitious development plans had to be rolled back. The restricted national budget also encouraged the use of oil in barter deals. In 1984, Saudi Arabia purchased ten Boeing 747s to join the fleet of Saudia Airlines, paid for using of oil. Yamani is known to have strongly objected to this subordination of the country's OPEC quota and warned Fahd of the effect on oil prices. He was, however, unsuccessful in stopping the deal.\n\nAt an OPEC meeting in October 1986, Fahd sent his oil minister a cable demanding Saudi Arabia's oil quota to be increased and the price of oil set at $18, which Yamani refused to sign. Yamani's biographer suggests that Fahd did not understand basic economic principles, although the relationship between the King and Yamani had already greatly deteriorated by this time; apparently Yamani had begun to remove files from his government office in 1985.\n\nOn 29 October 1986, a brief announcement was made on Saudi television that Yamani had been dismissed. He was replaced by Hisham Nazer. Detailed information of events is not known as Yamani refuses to discuss his last years in office or his relationship with King Fahd and the Sudairi Seven. Fahd's jealousy and personal dislike of Yamani, the problems of the oil glut, and Yamani's questioning of barter deals may all have contributed to his dismissal. For some weeks after, Yamani was prevented from leaving Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn July 1982, Yamani founded Investcorp, private equity firm, with several other oil ministers and well-known financiers. The firm's initial investments included Tiffany & Co., Breguet, a Swiss watch maker, and Chaumet, a French jeweller. Yamani, himself known to be a watch lover, also became majority shareholder of Vacheron Constantin in 1987. In 1996, Yamani's shares were then sold to Vendôme Luxury Group, owned by Richemont. During the eleven years of his ownership, watch production increased from 3,614 to 11,019.\n\nIn 1988, Yamani established the Al-Furqan Islamic Heritage Foundation under the Yamani Cultural and Charitable Foundation, which endeavours to preserve and publish historically important Islamic works.\n\nIn 1990, Yamani founded the Centre for Global Energy Studies, a London-based market analysis group claiming to provide objective information on energy issues. Board members have included Edward Heath, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Denis Healey, all friends of Yamani.\n\nWith the death of King Fahd in August 2005, some felt it was still possible that Yamani would return to the Saudi Government under King Abdullah, most likely as an ambassador, but sources close to Yamani indicated that it was highly unlikely.\n\nYamani's first wife was an Iraqi. They had three children. In 1956, Yamani's first daughter, Mai Yamani, was born, followed by second daughter Maha in 1959 and first son Hani in 1961. Mai Yamani later studied anthropology and is now an author and Research Fellow at the Royal Institute for International Affairs. Maha received a law degree from Cambridge and Hani a degree in business administration. Yamani married his second wife Tamam al Anbar on 23 March 1975, and had five children: Faisal (born 1976), Sharaf (born 1977), Sarah (born 1979), Arwa (born 1981) and Ahmed (born 1983). Yamani is fluent in Arabic, English and French.\n\nHis negotiation style, as remarked on by Henry Kissinger, was to wine and dine other dignitaries until the point of fullness and lethargy, before beginning protracted negotiations (\"Reader's Digest\", circa 1970).\n\n"}
{"id": "2260887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260887", "title": "Politics of global warming", "text": "Politics of global warming\n\nThe complex politics of global warming results from numerous cofactors arising from the global economy's dependence on carbon dioxide () emitting fossil fuels; and because greenhouse gases such as , methane and (mostly from agriculture) cause global warming. \n\n\nThe focus areas for global warming politics are Adaptation, Mitigation, Finance, Technology and Losses which are well quantified and studied but the urgency of the global warming challenge combined with the implication to almost every facet of a nation-state's economic interests places significant burdens on the established largely-voluntary global institutions that have developed over the last century; institutions that have been unable to effectively reshape themselves and move fast enough to deal with this unique challenge. Rapidly developing countries which see traditional energy sources as a means to fuel their development, well funded environmental lobbying groups and an established fossil fuel energy paradigm boasting a mature and sophisticated political lobbying infrastructure all combine to make global warming politics extremely polarized. Distrust between developed and developing countries at most international conferences that seek to address the topic add to the challenges. Further adding to the complexity is the advent of the Internet and the development of media technologies like blogs and other mechanisms for disseminating information that enable the exponential growth in production and dissemination of competing points of view which make it nearly impossible for the development and dissemination of an objective view into the enormity of the subject matter and its politics.\n\nTraditional environmental challenges generally involve behavior by a small group of industries which create products or services for a limited set of consumers in a manner that causes some form of damage to the environment which is clear. As an example, a gold mine might release a dangerous chemical byproduct into a waterway that kills the fish there: a clear environmental damage. By contrast, is a naturally occurring colorless odorless trace gas that is essential to the biosphere. Carbon dioxide () is produced by all animals and utilized by plants and algae to build their body structures. Plant structures buried for tens of millions of years sequester carbon to form coal, oil and gas which modern industrial societies find essential to economic vitality. Over 80% of the worlds energy is derived from emitting fossil fuels and over 91% of the world's energy is derived from non carbon-neutral energy sources. Scientists attribute the increases of in the atmosphere to industrial emissions and scientists agree the increase in causes global warming. This essential nature to the world's economies combined with the complexity of the science and the interests of countless interested parties make climate change a non-traditional environmental challenge.\n\nThe vast majority of developed countries rely on emitting energy sources for large components of their economic activity. Fossil fuel energy generally dominates the following areas of an OECD economy:\n\nIn addition, emitting fossil fuels many times dominate the utilities aspect of an economy that provide electricity for:\n\nPeak oil may significantly affect geopolitics.\n\n fast growing cities in developing countries lack alternatives to traditional high-carbon cement, and the hydrogen economy and carbon capture and storage are not widespread.\n\nThe developing world sees economic and industrial development as a natural right and the evidence shows that the developing world is industrializing. The developing world is using emitting fossil fuels as one of the primary energy sources to fuel their development. At the same time the scientific consensus on climate change and the existing global governance bodies like the United Nations are urging all countries to decrease their emissions. Developing countries logically resist this lobbying to decrease their use of fossil fuels without significant concessions like:\n\nThere are significant disagreements over which metrics to use when tracking global warming and there are also disagreements over which countries should be subject to emissions restrictions.\n\nWhile the biosphere is indifferent to whether the greenhouse gases are produced by one country or by a multitude, the countries of the world do express an interest in such matters. As such disagreements arise on whether per capita emissions should be used or whether total emissions should be used as a metric for each individual country. Countries also disagree over whether a developing country should share the same commitment as a developed country that has been emitting and other greenhouse gases for close to a century.\n\nSome developing countries expressly state that they require assistance if they are to develop, which is seen as a right, in a fashion that does not contribute or other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Many times, these needs materialize as profound differences in global conferences by countries on the subject and the debates quickly turn to pecuniary matters.\n\nMost developed countries place very modest limits on their willingness to assist developing countries.\n\nSome developing countries fall under the category of vulnerable to climate change. These countries involve small, sometimes isolated, island nations, low lying nations, nations which rely on drinking water from shrinking glaciers etc. These vulnerable countries see themselves as the victims of climate change and some have organized themselves under groups like the Climate Vulnerable Forum. These countries seek climate finance from the developed and the industrializing countries to help them adapt to the impending catastrophes that they see climate change will bring upon them. For these countries climate change is seen as an existential threat and the politics of these countries is to seek reparation and adaptation monies from the developed world and some see it as their right.\n\nGovernment policies regarding climate change and many official reports on the subject usually revolve around one of the following:\n\nThe primary mechanism for the world to tackle global warming is through the Paris Agreement, which replaced the Kyoto Protocol in 2020, both established under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) treaty.\n\nIn 2014, the UN with Peru and France created the Global Climate Action portal for writing and checking all the climate commitments\n\nIn 2019 climate change became an increasingly important political issue in Germany. In 2019 the highest court in the Netherlands has upheld a landmark ruling that defines protection from the devastation of climate change as a human right and requires the government to be more ambitious in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The future energy policy of China includes one of the most important climate decisions of the early 2020s: when to stop building coal-fired power stations.\n\nCity politicians advocating measures which have local short-term benefits for their constituents, such as low emission zones, may also have the co-benefit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund periodically assesses global subsidies for fossil fuels as part of its work on climate, and it found in a working paper published in 2019, that the fossil fuel industry received $5.2 trillion in subsidies in 2017. This amounts to 6.4 percent of the global gross domestic product. In line with these findings, the Central Banks of France and the United Kingdom appealed to stop subsidies to fossil fuels and the European Investment bank has announced it will stop financing fossil fuels projects by the end of 2021.\n\nAccording to the International Institute for Sustainable Development most attempts to remove fossil fuel subsidies are successful and the keys points are to: consult, compensate poor people affected by the change, and implement step-by-step.\n\nSandbag and Europe Beyond Coal have analysed policy in Europe and suggest that coal phase out should be: ambitious, legislated. just. clean, economic, healthy, reliable and smart.\n\n the preservation of forests is emerging as a global political issue.\n\nThere are numerous special interest groups, PACs, organizations, corporations who have public and private positions on the multifaceted topic of global warming. The following is a partial list of the types of special interest parties that have demonstrated an interest in the politics of global warming:\n\nThe various interested parties sometimes align with one another to reinforce their message. Sometimes industries will fund specialty nonprofit organizations to raise awareness and lobby on their behest. The combinations and tactics that the various interested parties use are nuanced and sometimes unlimited in the variety of their approaches to promote their positions onto the general public.\n\nIn the scientific literature, there is an overwhelming consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused primarily by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases.\n\nThe politicization of science in the sense of a manipulation of science for political gains is a part of the political process. It is part of the controversies about intelligent design (compare the Wedge strategy) or Merchants of Doubt, scientists that are under suspicion to willingly obscure findings. e.g. about issues like tobacco smoke, ozone depletion, global warming or acid rain. However, e.g. in case of the Ozone depletion, global regulation based on the Montreal Protocol has been successful, in a climate of high uncertainty and against strong resistance while in case of Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol failed.\n\nWhile the IPCC process tries to find and orchestrate the findings of global (climate) change research to shape a worldwide consensus on the matter it has been itself been object of a strong politicization. Anthropogenic climate change evolved from a mere science issue to a top global policy topic.\n\nThe IPCC process having built a broad science consensus does not hinder governments to follow different, if not opposing goals. In case of the ozone depletion challenge, there was global regulation already being installed before a scientific consensus was established.\n\nA linear model of policy-making, based on a \"more knowledge we have, the better the political response will be\" does therefore not apply. Knowledge policy, successfully managing knowledge and uncertainties as base of political decision making requires a better understanding of the relation between science, public (lack of) understanding and policy instead. Michael Oppenheimer confirms limitations of the IPCC consensus approach and asks for concurring, smaller assessments of special problems instead of large scale attempts as in the previous IPCC assessment reports. He claims that governments require a broader exploration of uncertainties in the future.\n\nIt has been estimated that only 0.12% of all funding for climate-related research is spent on the social science of climate change mitigation. Vastly more funding is spent on natural science studies of climate change and considerable sums are also spent on studies of impact of and adaptation to climate change. It has been argued that this is a misallocation of resources, as the most urgent puzzle at the current juncture is to work out how to change human behavior to mitigate climate change, whereas the natural science of climate change is already well established and there will be decades and centuries to handle adaptation.\n\nHistorically, the politics of climate change dates back to several conferences in the late 1960s and the early 1970s under NATO and President Richard Nixon. 1979 saw the world's first World Climate Conference. 1985 was the year that the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer was created and two years later in 1987 saw the signing of the Montreal Protocol under the Vienna convention. This model of using a Framework conference followed by Protocols under the Framework was seen as a promising governing structure that could be used as a path towards a functional governance approach that could be used to tackle broad global multi-nation/state challenges like global warming.\n\nOne year later in 1988 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was created by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme to assess the risk of human-induced climate change. Margaret Thatcher 1988 strongly supported IPCC and 1990 was instrumental to found the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research in Exeter.\n\nIn 1991 the book The First Global Revolution was published by the Club of Rome report which sought to connect environment, water availability, food production, energy production, materials, population growth and other elements into a blueprint for the twenty-first century: political thinking was evolving to look at the world in terms of an integrated global system not just in terms of weather and climate but in terms of energy needs, food, population, etc.\n\n1992 was the year that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was agreed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and the framework entered into force 21 March 1994. The conference established a yearly meeting, a conference of the parties or COP meeting to be held to continue work on Protocols which would be enforceable treaties\n\n1995 saw the creation of the phrase \"preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\" (also called \"avoiding dangerous climate change\") first appeared in a policy document of a governmental organization, the IPCC's Second Assessment Report: Climate Change 1995. and in 1996 the European Union adopt a goal of limiting temperature rises to a maximum 2 °C rise in average global temperature.\n\nIn 1997 the Kyoto Protocol was created under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in a very similar structure as the Montreal Protocol was under the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer which would have yearly meetings of the members or CMP meetings. However, in the same year, the US Senate passed Byrd–Hagel Resolution rejecting Kyoto without more commitments from developing countries.\n\nSince the 1992 UNFCCC treaty, eighteen COP sessions and eight CMP sessions have been held under the existing structure. In that time, global CO2 emissions have risen significantly and developing countries have grown significantly with China replacing the United States as the largest emitter of greenhouse gases. To some, the UNFCCC has made significant progress in helping the world become aware of the perils of global warming and has moved the world forward in the addressing of the challenge. To others, the UNFCCC process has been a failure due to its inability to control the rise of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nA number of proposals for a Global Climate Regime are currently discussed, as the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action calls for a comprehensive new agreement in 2015 that includes both Annex-I and Non-Annex-I parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2260894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260894", "title": "Proportional division", "text": "Proportional division\n\nA proportional division is a kind of fair division in which a resource is divided among \"n\" partners with subjective valuations, giving each partner at least 1/\"n\" of the resource by his/her own subjective valuation. \n\nProportionality was the first fairness criterion studied in the literature; hence it is sometimes called \"simple fair division\". It was first conceived by Steinhaus.\n\nConsider a land asset that has to be divided among 3 heirs: Alice and Bob who think that it's worth 3 million dollars, and George who thinks that it's worth $4.5M. In a proportional division, Alice receives a land-plot that she believes to be worth at least $1M, Bob receives a land-plot that \"he\" believes to be worth at least $1M (even though Alice may think it is worth less), and George receives a land-plot that he believes to be worth at least $1.5M.\n\nA proportional division does not always exist. For example, if the resource contains several indivisible items and the number of people is larger than the number of items, then some people will get no item at all and their value will be zero. Nevertheless, such a division exists with high probability for indivisible items under certain assumptions on the valuations of the agents.\n\nMoreover, a proportional division is guaranteed to exist if the following conditions hold:\n\nHence, proportional division is usually studied in the context of fair cake-cutting. See proportional cake-cutting for detailed information about procedures for achieving a proportional division in the context of cake-cutting.\n\nA more lenient fairness criterion is \"partial proportionality\", in which each partner receives a certain fraction \"f\"(\"n\") of the total value, where \"f\"(\"n\") ≤ 1/\"n\". Partially proportional divisions exist (under certain conditions) even for indivisible items.\n\nA \"super-proportional division\" is a division in which each partner receives strictly more than 1/\"n\" of the resource by their own subjective valuation.\n\nOf course such a division does not always exist: when all partners have exactly the same value functions, the best we can do is give each partner exactly 1/\"n\". So a necessary condition for the existence of a super-proportional division is that not all partners have the same value measure.\n\nThe surprising fact is that, when the valuations are additive and non-atomic, this condition is also sufficient. I.e., when there are at least \"two\" partners whose value function is even slightly different, then there is a super-proportional division in which \"all\" partners receive more than 1/\"n\". See super-proportional division for details.\n\nOne advantage of the proportionality criterion over envy-freeness and similar criteria is that it is stable with regards to voluntary exchanges.\n\nAs an example, assume that a certain land is divided among 3 partners: Alice, Bob and George, in a division that is both proportional and envy-free. Several months later, Alice and George decide to merge their land-plots and re-divide them in a way that is more profitable for them. From Bob's point of view, the division is still proportional, since he still holds a subjective value of at least 1/3 of the total, regardless of what Alice and George do with their plots. On the other hand, the new division might not be envy free. For example, it is possible that initially both Alice and George received a land-plot which Bob subjectively values as 1/3, but now after the re-division George got all the value (in Bob's eyes) so now Bob envies George.\n\nHence, using envy-freeness as the fairness criterion implies that we must constrain the right of people to voluntary exchanges after the division. Using proportionality as the fairness criterion has no such negative implications.\n\nAn additional advantage of proportionality is that it is compatible with individual rationality in the following sense. Suppose \"n\" partners own a resource in common. In many practical scenarios (though not always), the partners have the option to sell the resource in the market and split the revenues such that each partner receives exactly 1/\"n\". Hence, a rational partner will agree to participate in a division procedure, only if the procedure guarantees that he receives at least 1/\"n\" of his total value.\n\nAdditionally, there should be at least a possibility (if not a guarantee) that the partner receives more than 1/\"n\"; this explains the importance of the existence theorems of super-proportional division.\n\n\n"}

The character was created by Kevin VanHook, Don Perlin, and Bob Layton.\n\nBloodshot was created by Kevin VanHook, Don Perlin, and Bob Layton during a wave of popularity for Valiant Comics. The character's name was suggested by artist David Chlystek. The character first appeared in three panels on the last page of \"Eternal Warrior\" #4 (November 1992), before making his first full appearance in \"Rai\" #0 (November 1992) a week later.\n\nBloodshot is a former soldier with powers of regeneration and meta-morphing made possible through nanites injected into his blood, hence the name Bloodshot. After having his memory wiped numerous times, Bloodshot is out to discover who he really is and get vengeance on those who did this to him. Bloodshot's bloodstream contains a billion nanobots, enabling him to heal from injuries quickly, interface with technology, and shape shift his mass.\n\nProject Rising Spirit's program to create the ultimate soldier stretches back decades, and reached critical mass in the depths of World War II. Though the initial products of the program were crudely enhanced and highly expendable foot soldiers suitable only for the simplest scenarios, these early subjects were able to complete high-intensity missions regardless of any obstacles. Over the decades, these results ensured that the \"Bloodshot\" program was consistently earmarked for future development and continued to break new ground.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, '80s, and '90s, P.R.S. redefined the nanotechnology that would power Bloodshot, and develop a new artificial intelligence system that allowed him to be deployed in a wider array of off-the-battlefield counterintelligence and espionage missions. While Bloodshot was self-aware to a degree, the human-machine hybrid was still deemed to inflict unacceptably high levels of collateral damage. In 2007, another P.R.S. scientist, Dr. Emmanuel Kuretich, discovered his employers' intention to redirect the Bloodshot program in to a new area: the targeting and capture of the extremely rare, psionically powered children called \"psiots.\" Alarmed, Kuretich fled P.R.S. for Toyo Harada's Harbinger Foundation, where he secretly began forging a plan to undo P.R.S.\n\nSeveral years later, while on a routine mission in Afghanistan, Bloodshot is captured by Kuretich, who forcibly extracts the records of Bloodshot's missions with the intent of exposing Project Rising Spirit to the world. The process, however, unlocks all of Bloodshot's false memories, which had been used to motivate him in war zones throughout the world, all at once.\n\nP.R.S., fearing that Bloodshot has finally gone rogue, decides to rein him in. Bloodshot escapes capture with the aid of an ambulance driver named Kara Murphy before finally returning to P.R.S. to uncover the truth behind his identity. Tipped off by Kuretich, Bloodshot storms a P.R.S. facility in Nevada, but finds only the sub-basement facility known as the Nursery. Built to house the empowered psiot children captured by Bloodshot, freeing the Nursery's captives has been Kuretich and Harada's true objective all along. Bloodshot is forced to combat the Nursery's sadistic psiot jailer Gamma and P.R.S.'s outdated cyborg hit squad Chainsaw. Bloodshot frees the captive children, including generation Zero, an action that inadvertently sets off a chain reaction of events that would culminate in the Harbinger Wars in the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nConfronted by Toyo Harada in the aftermath of the P.R.S. breakout, Bloodshot's capacity for free will is overridden by the \"Harada Protocol\", a piece of hidden P.R.S. programming that compels him to terminate Harada. A vicious battle ensues, which leaves Harada seriously wounded, and Bloodshot with a depleted nanite count.\n\nIn the closing moments of the Harbinger wars, Bloodshot again falls into Harada's clutches, and spends several weeks as a prisoner of the Harbinger Foundation. During this time, Harada subjects Bloodshot to cruel and painful experiments as he attempts to solve the secret behind the incredibly rare nanites in Bloodshot's bloodstream.\n\nHowever, Project Rising Spirit quickly expedites a rescue led by the H.A.R.D. Corps. After storming Harada's El Segundo facility, they successfully extract Bloodshot, who shortly thereafter accepts a spot on the H.A.R.D. Corps roster. Bloodshot is rewarded with a hard copy of the P.R.S. file on his true identity.\n\nBloodshot is deployed across the globe on various missions alongside the H.A.R.D. Corps, including as assignment to retrieve a former P.R.S. test subject codenamed Prodigal and his supposedly \"immortal\" bodyguard.\n\nVolume One and Volume Two of \"Bloodshot\" keeps the same core story elements with different settings and plots.\n\nAngelo Mortalli has become the ultimate killing machine. His memories have been erased and his blood has been infused with microscopic computers called nanites. These nanites allow him to heal wounds quickly, dominate electronic devices, and fully control every aspect of his body to maximize his physical capabilities. A modern-day Frankenstein's monster, he wages a one-man war, taking out the mob, the police and his covert government creators, in his struggle to find out who he was and what he has become.\n\nAngelo Mortalli, a.k.a. Bloodshot\n\nMortalli is a ruthless killer climbing the mob ranks when his crime family betrays him and has him framed for murder. He goes into federal witness protection but is betrayed by one of the FBI members guarding him. He is then kidnapped and taken to be part of an experimental procedure known as \"Project Rising Spirit\". His body is injected with microscopic computers called nanites. The nanites quickly go to work, rebuilding his brain and then the rest of his body, unexpectedly reviving Angelo but erasing his memory in the process. The nanites now fully control Angelo's body (manipulating blood flow, adrenaline levels etc.) giving him augmented reflexes and strength, enhanced hearing; the ability to heal rapidly, control of electronic devices, as well as a pre-programmed database containing all martial arts styles as well as weapons knowledge. Angry, violent and unsure of what he has become, he escapes. Taking the name Bloodshot, he begins the process of piecing together who he was.\n\nDon Gino Canelli\n\nAngelo Mortalli's mafia boss and his girlfriend's father is Gino, a ruthless man who will do anything to protect his family. He treats Angelo like a son. When he learns that Angelo has been cheating on his daughter, he orders Angelo set up for the murder of a rival without a second thought.\n\nHideyoshi Iwatsu\n\nIwatsu is an old and dangerous Japanese scientist who created the Bloodshot procedure. He is extremely immoral, using unwilling “volunteers” for his experiments, all of whom die as a result. Bloodshot is the first subject to survive more than a few days. \n\nTanaka\n\nTanaka is Hideyoshi Iwatsu's aide and right-hand man. More trusted by Hideyoshi than his biological son, Tanaka is a brilliant manipulator. Tanaka's arrogance blinds him, however, and leads to stupid mistakes on his part.\n\nAngelo Mortalli has been subjected against his will to a scientific experiment that has remade him into the ultimate killing machine, an engine of destruction codenamed Bloodshot. But, in the process, his memories were lost. His creators mean to use him as a weapon, an unstoppable assassin. But he breaks free and escapes. In this rendition, the writer, Len Kaminski, elaborates on BloodShot's nano technology. The nanites turn out to be like sentient beings that see him as their God and provoke him to self-induce a trance-like state using a mixture of substances in order to communicate with him directly. Deadly operatives of the super-secret government agency that sponsored his creation hunt him down. Following a broken trail of fragmentary recollections, Bloodshot fights a running battle against them, the mob and the police.\n\nBloodshot\n\nThe first and only success of Project Lazarus, Bloodshot is a miracle of technology, far exceeding his creators’ expectations. Microscopic machines called nanites injected into his blood maximize his physicality, heal his wounds, extend his senses and imbue him with the ability to interface with any electronic device. In his former life as Angelo Mortalli, he learns, he was a rising star in a New York crime family...but the trail doesn't end there. He was someone else before he was Mortalli. Who was Raymond Garrison?\n\nSimon Oreck\n\nThe Director in Chief of the Domestic Operations Authority (DOA), a covert operations arm of the United States government. An information trader, his business is knowledge and he has his eyes and ears in every branch of government – all of which is fed to him constantly by the wall of computers and monitors that fill his office. Despite usually preferring his department to remain behind the scenes, Oreck offers to commit DOA resources to helping the FBI extract information on the Cianelli crime family from the brain of recently deceased mobster Angelo Mortalli. But as always, Oreck is hiding his true motives.\n\nDoctor Frederick J. Stroheim\n\nSon of Nazi scientist Klaus Stroheim, the “Mengele of Dachau,” Frederick inherited his father's genius and his utter inhumanity. Project Lazarus is his brainchild.\n\nGina DeCarlo\n\nIn the process of eliminating all evidence that Angelo Mortalli ever existed, D.O.A. operatives expunged all documentation, razed his home, and even had phone books reprinted without his name. He also discovers that they coldly murdered Gina, the love of his life, to silence her. As if he didn't hate them enough already...\n\nThe Chainsaw\n\nKnown as the Special Circumstances Division, codename: The Chainsaw are a highly trained team of mercenaries that work for the Domestic Operations Authority (DOA). Utilizing a state-of-the-art group combat technology called Chainlink, the members of The Chainsaw are provided with instant data and communication tools that allow for perfect combat tactics and strategy. Each member is specialized in one area of covert warfare and utilizes the latest in DOA technology.\n\nMichael Pileggi\n\nA made man in the Cianelli crime family, Michael Pileggi is one of the few who know the truth behind Angelo Mortalli's death. Don Cianelli had ordered Pileggi to fake a funeral for Mortalli in order to prevent the Don's daughter and Mortalli's girlfriend Gina from becoming suspicious. When he hears that someone has been asking questions about Mortalli and killing his men for answers, he becomes paranoid and holes up in his heavily guarded mansion.\n\nThere are 25 issues in this volume, including #0. A 2012 relaunch by Valiant Publishing: Bloodshot is a man searching for his identity. He is a weapon, one built for military destruction. Using false memories the government has motivated him to do things while believing to himself that he was protecting an imagined family. But no more. When the weapon awakens, it malfunctions thus beginning a war over the control of Bloodshot's mind. Leaving a trail of destruction he breaks away from the military base he is being held at. A man marked with gray skin and a red mark on his chest, Bloodshot chooses to trust no one as he fights to figure out who he used to be, and what it is he has become. Series written by Duane Swierczynski. The series tied into the Harbinger Wars event with issues 10 through 13. Starting with issue 14, the series was retitled Bloodshot and Hard Corps, with the character as a member of the Hard Corps team. The series crossed over with Archer And Armstrong in a story arc titled \"Mission: Improbable\".\n\nRelaunched in 2015 by Jeff Lemire and Mico Suayan it ran for 18 regular issues, plus a #0, and annual, and the Bloodshot Island 4 issue miniseries. Bloodshot has had his nanites removed by Kay McHenry (Geomancer) and is trying to live a normal life. But when a number of shootings are carried out by men who look like Bloodshot, he must go back into the world he tried to leave behind.\n\nRelaunched again by Jeff Lemire and Mico Suayan, this time in 2017 with the addition of artist Lewis LaRosa, it ran for 12 regular issue plus a number of event tie ins. Following directly on from Bloodshot Reborn, Bloodshot must now protect his girlfriend Magic and their daughter from Magic's sadistic family. \n\nIn 2018 the writing trio of Kevin Grevioux, Lonnie Nadler and Zac Thompson, with artist Ken Lashley launched a new volume. It ran for 8 issues and as of January 2020 has not been collected in paperback or hardcover.\n\nAnother relaunch happened in 2019, with Tim Seeley writing and Brett Booth on art duties. This is the current ongoing Bloodshot volume.\n\nGenerally, the characters published by Valiant inhabit a shared universe/continuity. Characters appear or are referenced in each other's books. For example, there is a very definite connection between Rai and Bloodshot. Bloodshot's silicon based, nanite powered blood flows through Takao Konishi's veins (the last Rai). It grants him some of Bloodshot's memories and all of Bloodshot's powers. The entire line of warriors who were known as Rai were created by Grandmother in the image of Bloodshot to honor his heroism.\n\nBloodshot is one of the best selling Valiant characters with total sales in all languages approaching seven million comics. Shortly before the debut of the Bloodshot series the title character made two introductory appearances in popular titles \"Rai\" and \"Eternal Warrior\". Based on these appearances there was a groundswell of demand for the character to return and high anticipation for the premier issue. \"Bloodshot\" #1 (February 1993) was a much anticipated comic that became a best selling issue and has gone on to sell approximately one million copies. The original series was written by Kevin VanHook and drawn by Don Perlin. The premiere issue featured the first \"Chromium\" comic book cover.\n\n\"Bloodshot\" #1 (July 2012) was awarded \"Best Comic\" by Diamond Comic Distributors (the American comics industry's leading distributor) and \"Best Innovation\" for its chromium cover. \"Bloodshot\" was named one of the Top Ten Comic-Book Series of 2012 by Nerdage.\n\nA film based on Bloodshot, titled \"Bloodshot\", starring Vin Diesel had a theatrical release in the United States on March 13, 2020, by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is intended to be the first installment in a series of films set within a Valiant Comics shared cinematic universe. Directed by David S. F. Wilson (in his feature directorial debut) from a screenplay by Jeff Wadlow and Eric Heisserer and a story by Wadlow, the film stars Vin Diesel, Eiza González, Sam Heughan, Toby Kebbell, and Guy Pearce.\n\nBloodshot appears in \"Ninjak vs. the Valiant Universe\", portrayed by Jason David Frank.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2260926", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260926", "title": "Ponteland", "text": "Ponteland\n\nPonteland ( ) is a town and civil parish in Northumberland, England, north of Newcastle upon Tyne. The name means \"island in the Pont\", after the River Pont which flows from west to east and joins the River Blyth further downstream, before flowing into the North Sea. Newcastle Airport is to the south of the village.\n\nPonteland was first built on marshland near St Mary's Church and the old bridge. Most of the marshland has now been drained to make way for housing. In the industrial era, Ponteland village enlarged to include residential developments in Darras Hall. The village has grown to be a significant commuter village, although it retains a local community. Its location just outside Newcastle, in proximity to the airport but also on the edge of rural Northumberland, has resulted in parts of Ponteland containing some of North-East England's most expensive houses, being home for many of the region's business leaders, footballers and celebrities.\n\nThe civil parish of Ponteland includes the town of Ponteland, the Darras Hall estate, and the villages of Kirkley, Medburn, Milbourne and Prestwick.\n\nThere has been nearly a thousand years of Christian worship in Ponteland. This traditionally concentrated around St Mary's the Virgin, the prominent Church of England church near Ponteland's village green. St Mary's traces its first construction to the Norman period in the twelfth century and is still an active church. Ponteland has parish registries dating from 1602 and has been recorded in Bishops transcripts as an important place of religion since 1762.\n\nChristian worship in Ponteland has expanded to other denominations in recent centuries. The Ponteland Methodist Church opened in 1841. An 1848 review appreciated Ponteland also hosted places of worship for Scottish Presbyterians and a Wesleyan chapel.\n\nIn 1867, an Anglican sister church to St Mary's opened in Milbourne, one of Ponteland's wards. In 1884, a Catholic church was established at St Matthews, now part of the Hexham and Newcastle Catholic diocese. In the twentieth century, a United Reformed Church opened in Darras Hall.\n\nIn the 13th century, Ponteland narrowly escaped conflict when the Treaty of Newcastle (1244) ensured a last minute peace between Scottish and English forces. The treaty bears the name of Ponteland's nearest city but was actually signed in the village.\n\nWhile Ponteland Castle was never rebuilt as a military stronghold, it transformed into a brothel. Known as The Blackbird, this still serves the Ponteland community, nearly seven hundred years after the destruction of its original purpose.\nParts of Darras Hall were used as a prisoner-of-war camp in the Second World War. The camp was designated number 69 of several hundred camps across Britain and held Italian and German prisoners of war. Reflecting the post-war growth of the village, Ponteland High School opened in 1972. The affluent housing estate of Darras Hall is a popular choice for many of North East England's wealthy residents and many people associated with Newcastle United Football Club live in the parish including Alan Shearer, Peter Beardsley, Steven Taylor, George Hall, Phil Barton and Terry McDermott.\n\nIn 2005, Darras Hall received considerable media attention when a convicted rapist moved to the estate after purchasing a house with his National Lottery winnings.\n\nIn the early 21st century, an expanding Ponteland and the adjoining Darras Hall was home to approximately 11,000 people and it secured \"town\" status within Northumberland.\n\nPonteland is notable for a ruined pele tower, its bridge, and its four churches: St Mary's (Church of England), St Matthew's (Roman Catholic), Ponteland Methodist Church and Ponteland United Reformed Church.\n\nSt Mary's churchyard includes the Grade II listed 18th-century tombstones of Matthew Forster and William Turnbull.\n\nPonteland previously boasted a small castle or tower house, which was largely destroyed by the Scottish army under the Earl of Douglas, the day before the 1388 Battle of Otterburn. The remains were incorporated into the building now occupied by the Blackbird Inn, which is rumoured to contain an old tunnel connecting it to St Mary's Church across the road. The tunnel was supposedly bricked up behind the fireplace in The Tunnel Room.\n\nA plaque outside The Blackbird records:\n\"'Ponteland first appeared in the national history in the 13th century, when the feuds between the Kings of England and Scotland were in full spate.\"\n\n\"The signing of a peace treaty between Henry III of England and Alexander of Scotland took place on the knoll of the marshes where the Blackbird stands today.\"\n\n\"The castle on this site was destroyed in 1388 during the Scottish retreat from Newcastle.\"\nTo the north of Ponteland is another public house with links to Scotland. This marks an occasion during the Jacobite rising of 1745, where Scottish armies advanced into England to further claims to the English throne. During this incursion, Charles Edward Stuart, popularly Bonnie Prince Charlie, reputedly bathed at a Ponteland public house. Marking this occasion, the house is still called The Highlander.\n\nOne of the oldest houses, or farms at the time, in the Darras Hall area is Little Callerton House. The Old Mill, the house where Alan Shearer used to live, and various other dwellings in the area belonged to Little Callerton House, which is approximately 450 years old. On the edge of the estate at High Callerton, Rebellion House is a 16th-century bastle, altered and extended in the 17th century. \n\nPonteland parish is home to 10,921 people or 3% of the Northumberland population of 316,000. Significantly more Ponteland residents live in detached housing versus Northumberland county overall; 65% of Ponteland parish residents are detached home residents versus 25% of Northumbrians. Ponteland also has significantly more ethnic minorities than Northumberland on average.\n\nIn Ponteland, 8.3% of the population are non-white British, compared with only 2.8% for Northumberland. This makes the town more ethnically diverse than Gateshead, which has the largest concentration of foreign people in Tyne and Wear outside Newcastle. Ponteland also has double the percentage of Asian people compared with the town, however, this does mean that Ponteland has a smaller percentage of black people and mainland Europeans compared with Gateshead. Ponteland has the lowest White British population out of any town in Northumberland with only 10,004 out of the 10,921 residents being of that group.\n\nPonteland has a largely Christian population, with 7,774 Christians (71.2%). This is followed by those of no religion, at 1,920 or 17.6% of the population.\n\nPonteland residents are particularly active in commercial and financial services in northern England, southern Scotland, and the wider European Union. The parish benefits from its proximity to Newcastle Airport, which is the tenth busiest in the United Kingdom and operates frequent flights to London Heathrow, several European capitals, and North America. Ponteland residents are more likely than Northumbrians to be managers directors and senior officials or in the professions or associate professions. Ponteland has 58% such individuals versus 38% in Northumberland overall.\n\nThere are five state schools within the parish: two first schools, Ponteland First School and Darras Hall First School; two middle schools, Ponteland Middle School and Richard Coates Church of England Middle School; and, for 13–18-year olds, Ponteland High School, with 1,100 students from Ponteland and its surrounding communities.\n\nPonteland is close to several independent schools. These include the Dame Allan's School union of independent schools and the Westfield School for Girls, both from Ponteland. The Royal Grammar School in Jesmond, the northeast's longest established independent school, and Newcastle High School for Girls, the amalgamation of the former Church High and Central High girls schools, are both from Ponteland.\n\nPonteland's retail and commercial amenities concentrate around the village's main street, the nearby industrial estate, and Broadway, a small commercial zone serving Darras Hall. The former headquarters for Northumbria Police, now the location of a communications and training complex, is just north of Ponteland.\n\nPonteland railway station was once served by the Ponteland Railway branch line of the North Eastern Railway (later part of the London & North Eastern Railway) from Newcastle, including a short spur to Darras Hall. Plans to electrify the line were abandoned in 1907, however, and the spur line lost passenger services in 1929 when volume fell below expectations. However, a substantial part of Ponteland's railway connections have been resurrected as part of the Tyne & Wear Metro system to serve Newcastle Airport.\n\nReflecting its rural surroundings, Ponteland has several country walks. These concentrate around Ponteland Park and include a walk from the Diamond Inn to Kirkley and from Medburn to the Highlander Inn.\n\nPonteland has four pubs: The Seven Stars, The Blackbird, The Badger and The Diamond Inn.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2260927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260927", "title": "Contraflow lane", "text": "Contraflow lane\n\nIn transport engineering nomenclature, a counterflow lane or contraflow lane is a lane in which traffic flows in the opposite direction of the surrounding lanes.\n\nContraflow lanes are often used for bicycles or bus rapid transit on what are otherwise one-way streets. In a sample configuration for buses, a street might have four lanes: the outermost lanes are reserved for buses in both directions, while the center two lanes are available for general traffic in only one direction. Thus, the street functions as two-way for buses, but one-way for all other vehicles.\n\nContraflow lanes can also be used to extend the capacity of separated limited-access roads when there are physical constraints. For example, the Boston I-93-Southeast Expressway \"Zipper-Lane\", which provides an HOV lane for the morning rush on the northbound side, and the afternoon rush on the southbound side.\n\nIn certain situations, reversible lanes will be contraflow for a portion of the day. The Lincoln Tunnel XBL to the Lincoln Tunnel is a contraflow exclusive bus lane for buses during the morning peak period. The XBL lane is fed by the New Jersey Turnpike at Exits 16E and 17, and New Jersey Route 3. The helix, tunnel, and terminal are owned and operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the bi-state agency that also operates the contraflow lane along the left lane of three westbound lanes. The XBL serves over 1,800 buses, which transport more than 65,000 persons, each morning and is a major component of the morning \"inbound\" commutation crossing the Hudson River.\n\nWhen lanes on motorways are closed for repair and maintenance, a contraflow lane may be set up on the other side of the central reservation.\n\nContraflow bus lanes, areas in which a dedicated lane of an otherwise one way street is reversed for buses and other mass transit, exist in locations such as:\n\nFrom June 1990 to June 2002, a similar line existed in Montreal, along Pie-IX Boulevard; this was indefinitely suspended after two fatalities.\nGovernment buses use a bus-only contraflow lane on Macquarie St in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.\n\nAuthorised buses, emergency vehicles and taxis use a contraflow lane on Petrie Tce, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\n\nTram lanes are an extension to this system found in cities with curbside streetcar networks. For example, tram lanes in Zagreb can be used only by trams, buses, and taxicabs.\n\nContraflow is a common part of decent cycling infrastructure and is often seen on one-way streets. A standard example is that car and other vehicular traffic might have only one lane while on both sides there are bike lanes; one going in the same direction as the vehicular traffic, the other (the contraflow bike lane) allows cyclists to safely go in the opposite direction to the cars. This is allowed as the road may not be wide enough for two lanes of car traffic but there is enough room to allow for the additional bicycle lane; and without it cyclists may be forced to take a long, and perhaps unsafe, detour.\n\nAnother example is the same as the above but there is only one bike lane, the contraflow lane, and bicycles travelling in the same direction as the cars share the cars' lane. This solution would be more suited to very narrow roads or ones with light traffic.\n\nIn Belgium since about 2005, and in France since 2010, the default position in towns has been for one-way streets to be available for cycling in either direction, known in French as \"sens unique limité (SUL)\". In this case, a contraflow cycle lane is often marked in paint, with dotted white lines and ideograms of a bicycle, either all the way along the street if busy, or more commonly just at junctions.\n\nIn the Netherlands, most one-way streets are two way for cyclists, although this is not always marked by a counterflow lane. This is presented as a 'one-way street, except for cyclists'. One-way streets that do not include contraflow for bicycles are rare and are usually only found as pairs of a single street (with very large median) that are too far apart to be presented as a single street. It is not uncommon for cyclists to fail to notice a one-way street that does include contraflow for bicycles, because they are too accustomed to all one-way streets including bicycles.\n\nIn the United States, the town of Provincetown, Massachusetts on Cape Cod has long allowed cycling in both directions on its 3-mile long main street, Commercial Street. There is no marked cycle lane. This unusual condition required special state legislation in 1977 to give the local government permission to set its own rules for the street.\n\nContraflow cycling is often assumed to be associated with higher accidents risks, but where it has been properly evaluated, contraflow cycling actually seems to reduce the accidents risk.\n\n"}

{"id": "2260933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260933", "title": "Bijective numeration", "text": "Bijective numeration\n\nBijective numeration is any numeral system in which every non-negative integer can be represented in exactly one way using a finite string of digits. The name derives from this bijection (one-to-one correspondence) between the set of non-negative integers and the set of finite strings using a finite set of symbols (the \"digits\").\n\nMost ordinary numeral systems, such as the common decimal system, are not bijective because more than one string of digits can represent the same positive integer. In particular, adding leading zeroes does not change the value represented, so \"1\", \"01\" and \"001\" all represent the number one. Even though only the first is usual, the fact that the others are possible means that decimal is not bijective. However, unary, with only one digit, \"is\" bijective.\n\nA bijective base-\"k\" numeration is a bijective positional notation. It uses a string of digits from the set {1, 2, ..., \"k\"} (where \"k\" ≥ 1) to encode each positive integer; a digit's position in the string defines its value as a multiple of a power of \"k\". calls this notation \"k\"-adic, but it should not be confused with the \"p\"-adic numbers: bijective numerals are a system for representing ordinary integers by finite strings of nonzero digits, whereas the \"p\"-adic numbers are a system of mathematical values that contain the integers as a subset and may need infinite sequences of digits in any numerical representation.\n\nThe base-\"k\" bijective numeration system uses the digit-set {1, 2, ..., \"k\"} (\"k\" ≥ 1) to uniquely represent every non-negative integer, as follows:\n\n\n\nIn contrast, standard positional notation can be defined with a similar recursive algorithm where \n\nFor base formula_5, the bijective base-formula_6 numeration system could be extended to negative integers in the same way as the standard base-formula_7 numeral system by use of an infinite number of the digit formula_8, where formula_9, represented as a left-infinite sequence of digits formula_10. This is because the Euler summation \nmeaning that \nand for every positive number formula_13 with bijective numeration digit representation formula_14 is represented by formula_15. For base formula_16, negative numbers formula_17 are represented by formula_18 with formula_19, while for base formula_20, negative numbers formula_17 are represented by formula_22. This is similar to how in signed-digit representations, all integers formula_13 with digit representations formula_14 are represented as formula_25 where formula_26. This representation is no longer bijective, as the entire set of left-infinite sequences of digits is used to represent the formula_6-adic integers, of which the integers are only a subset.\n\nFor a given base \"k\" ≥ 1,\n\n\nThe bijective base-10 system is a base ten positional numeral system that does not use a digit to represent zero. It instead has a digit to represent ten, such as \"A\".\n\nAs with conventional decimal, each digit position represents a power of ten, so for example 123 is \"one hundred, plus two tens, plus three units.\" All positive integers that are represented solely with non-zero digits in conventional decimal (such as 123) have the same representation in decimal without a zero. Those that use a zero must be rewritten, so for example 10 becomes A, conventional 20 becomes 1A, conventional 100 becomes 9A, conventional 101 becomes A1, conventional 302 becomes 2A2, conventional 1000 becomes 99A, conventional 1110 becomes AAA, conventional 2010 becomes 19AA, and so on.\n\nAddition and multiplication in decimal without a zero are essentially the same as with conventional decimal, except that carries occur when a position exceeds ten, rather than when it exceeds nine. So to calculate 643 + 759, there are twelve units (write 2 at the right and carry 1 to the tens), ten tens (write A with no need to carry to the hundreds), thirteen hundreds (write 3 and carry 1 to the thousands), and one thousand (write 1), to give the result 13A2 rather than the conventional 1402.\n\nIn the bijective base-26 system one may use the Latin alphabet letters \"A\" to \"Z\" to represent the 26 digit values one to twenty-six. (A=1, B=2, C=3, ..., Z=26)\n\nWith this choice of notation, the number sequence (starting from 1) begins A, B, C, ..., X, Y, Z, AA, AB, AC, ..., AX, AY, AZ, BA, BB, BC, ...\n\nEach digit position represents a power of twenty-six, so for example, the numeral ABC represents the value = 731 in base 10.\n\nMany spreadsheets including Microsoft Excel use this system to assign labels to the columns of a spreadsheet, starting A, B, C, ..., Z, AA, AB, ..., AZ, BA, ..., ZZ, AAA, etc. For instance, in Excel 2013, there can be up to 16384 columns, labeled from A to XFD. A variant of this system is used to name variable stars. It can be applied to any problem where a systematic naming using letters is desired, while using the shortest possible strings.\n\nThe fact that every non-negative integer has a unique representation in bijective base-\"k\" (\"k\" ≥ 1) is a \"folk theorem\" that has been rediscovered many times. Early instances are for the case \"k\" = 10, and and for all \"k\" ≥ 1. Smullyan uses this system to provide a Gödel numbering of the strings of symbols in a logical system; Böhm uses these representations to perform computations in the programming language P′′. mentions the special case of \"k\" = 10, and discusses the cases \"k\" ≥ 2. appears to be another rediscovery, and hypothesizes that if ancient numeration systems used bijective base-\"k\", they might not be recognized as such in archaeological documents, due to general unfamiliarity with this system.\n\n"}

{"id": "2260940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260940", "title": "TV Parental Guidelines", "text": "TV Parental Guidelines\n\nThe TV parental guidelines are a television content rating system in the United States that was first proposed on December 19, 1996, by the United States Congress, the television industry and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and went into effect by January 1, 1997, on most major broadcast and cable networks in response to public concerns about increasingly explicit sexual content, graphic violence and strong profanity in television programs. It was established as a voluntary-participation system, with ratings to be determined by the individually participating broadcast and cable networks.\n\nThe ratings are generally applied to most television series, television films and edited broadcast or basic cable versions of theatrically released films; premium channels also assign ratings from the TV parental guidelines on broadcasts of some films that have been released theatrically or on home video, either if the Motion Picture Association of America did not assign a rating for the film or if the channel airs the unrated version of the film.\n\nThe ratings were designed to be used with the V-chip, which was mandated to be built into all television sets manufactured since 2000 (and the vast majority of cable/satellite set-top boxes), but the guidelines themselves have no legal force, and are not used on sports or news programs or during commercial advertisements. Many online television services, such as Hulu, Amazon Video and Netflix also use the guidelines system, along with digital video vendors such as the iTunes Store and Google Play and digital media players, including the Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Android TV and Roku platforms.\n\nIn the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the United States Congress called upon the entertainment industry to establish, within one year, a voluntary television rating system to provide parents with advance information on material in television programming that might be unsuitable for their children. This rating system would work in conjunction with the V-chip, a device embedded in television sets that enables parents to block programming they determine to be inappropriate.\n\nOn February 29, 1996, all segments of the entertainment industry, led by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), the National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NCTA), and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), joined together and voluntarily pledged to create such a system. They agreed that the guidelines would be applied by broadcast and cable networks in order to handle the large amount of programming that must be reviewed – some 2,000 hours a day. The guidelines would be applied episodically to all programming based on their content, except for news, sports and advertising.\n\nOn December 19, 1996, the industry announced the creation of the TV Parental Guidelines, a voluntary system of guidelines providing parents with information to help them make more informed choices about the television programs their children watch. The guidelines were modeled after the movie ratings system created by the Motion Picture Association of America in 1968. The television industry agreed to insert a ratings icon on-screen at the beginning of all rated programs, and to encode the guidelines for use with the V-chip. The industry also created a Monitoring Board, composed of TV industry experts, to ensure accuracy, uniformity and consistency of the guidelines and to consider any public questions about the guideline applied to a particular program. The TV Parental Guidelines went into use on January 1, 1997.\n\nIn response to calls to provide additional content information in the ratings system, on August 1, 1997, the television industry, in conjunction with representatives of children's and medical advocacy groups, announced revisions to the rating system. Under this revised system, television programming would continue to fall into one of the six ratings categories (TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G, TV-PG, TV-14 or TV-MA), but content descriptors would be added to the ratings where appropriate, based on the type(s) of objectionable content included in the individual program or episode: D (suggestive dialogue), L (coarse language), S (sexual content), V (violence) and FV (fantasy violence – a descriptor exclusively for use in the TV-Y7 category).\n\nFurther, the proposal stated that the icons and associated content symbols would appear for 15 seconds at the beginning of all rated programming, and that the size of the icons would be increased. The revised guidelines were supported by leading family and child advocacy groups, as well as television broadcasters, cable systems and networks, and television production companies. Finally, the revised proposal called for five representatives of the advocacy community to be added to the TV Parental Guidelines Monitoring Board. On March 12, 1998, the Federal Communications Commission found that the Industry Video Programming Rating System was acceptable, and adopted technical requirements for the V-chip.\n\n\n\"This program is designed to be appropriate for all children.\"<br>\nPrograms rated TV-Y are designed to be appropriate for children of all ages. The thematic elements portrayed in programs with this rating are specifically designed for a very young audience.\n\n\"This program is designed for children age 7 and above.\"<br>\nPrograms rated TV-Y7 are designed for children age 7 and older. The FCC states that it \"may be more appropriate for children who have acquired the developmental skills needed to distinguish between make-believe and reality.\"\nPrograms given the \"FV\" content descriptor exhibit more 'fantasy violence' and are generally more intense or combative than other programs rated TV-Y7.\n\n\"This program is suitable for all ages.\"<br>\nPrograms rated TV-G are generally suited for all audiences, though they may not necessarily contain content of interest to children. The FCC states that \"this rating does not signify a program designed specifically for children, (and) most parents may let younger children watch this program unattended.\" The thematic elements portrayed in programs with this rating contain little or no violence, mild language, and no sexual dialogue or situations.\n\n\"This program contains material that parents may find unsuitable for younger children.\"<br>\nPrograms rated TV-PG may contain some material that parents or guardians may find inappropriate for younger children. Programs assigned a TV-PG rating may include some inappropriate language, very little sexual content, suggestive dialogue, and/or mild violence.\n\n\"This program contains some material that many parents would find unsuitable for children under 14 years of age.\"<br>\nPrograms rated TV-14 contains material that parents or adult guardians may find unsuitable for children under the age of 14. The FCC warns that \"Parents are cautioned to exercise some care in monitoring this program and are cautioned against letting children under the age of 14 watch unattended.\" Programs with this rating contain crude humor, drug/alcohol use, inappropriate language, strong violence (may include some amounts of blood and gore), sex, and moderate suggestive themes or dialogue.\n\n\"This program is specifically designed to be viewed by adults and therefore may be unsuitable for children under 17.\"<br> Contains content that is unsuitable for children. This rating was originally TV-M prior to the announced revisions to the rating system in August 1997 but was changed due to a trademark dispute and in order to remove confusion with the Entertainment Software Rating Board's (ESRB) \"M for Mature\" rating for video games. This rating is very seldom used by broadcast networks or local television stations due to FCC restrictions on program content, although it is commonly applied to television programs featured on certain cable channels (basic and premium networks) and streaming networks for both mainstream and softcore programs. Broadcast programming that has carried a TV-MA warning includes the pilot of the CBS police series \"Brooklyn South\" and documentaries such as Ken Burns' \"The Vietnam War\" on PBS, along with a few 10 p.m. ET drama series episodes with sensitive content. Programs with this rating commonly include dark humor, frequent use of profanity, intense violence (may include blood and gore), and/or strong sexual themes.\n\nSome thematic elements, according to the FCC, \"may call for parental guidance and/or the program may contain one or more of the following\" sub-ratings, designated with an alphabetic letter:\n\nUp to four content descriptors can be applied alongside an assigned rating, depending on the kind of suggestive content featured in a program; the FV descriptor is an exception due to its sole use for the TV-Y7 rating, which can have no descriptor other than FV. As the rating increases pertaining to the age, the content matters generally get more intensive. These descriptors allow for 44 possible combinations for all the ratings total. The \"suggestive dialogue\" descriptor is used for TV-PG and TV-14 rated programs only. The violence descriptor was used for TV-Y7 programs from August 1997 until the creation of the 'FV' descriptor later that year.\n\nAn additional content descriptor, \"E/I\", is applied to select TV-Y, TV-Y7, and TV-G programs that are designed to meet the educational and informative needs of children. A minimum of three hours of E/I-compliant programming must be broadcast per week by each television network; all E/I programs must air between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.\n\nFor the first 15 seconds of every rated program lasting a half-hour or less, a large rating icon appears in the upper-left hand corner of the screen; previously this had a common design using a universal icon, but now often goes with a network's branding scheme, or as Netflix does, merely denotes the rating in a straight line of text. The icon was much smaller until June 2005 and only appeared on-screen for 7.5 seconds. For every rated program running an hour or longer, a rating appears in the upper-left hand corner of the television screen at the beginning of each half-hour. Starting in June 2005, many networks now display the ratings after every commercial break, in addition to the beginning of the program. Ratings icons formerly appeared in the safe area, even with a HD-designed presentation, but have moved into the top-left corner of the 16:9 picture as time has gone on.\n\nSome programs may voluntarily display a disclaimer regarding the show's objectionable content with the TV rating prior to the program starting, along with audibly repeating the same, with the reason for the rating (e.g. suggestive dialogue, drug and alcohol abuse, language, sexual situations, violence, nudity) and strongly cautioning parents to decide whether the program is suitable for their children. Several channels (including USA Network and AMC) insert special caution boards for horror animated programs at the end of commercial breaks, almost always occurring before a series uses the word \"fuck\" in uncensored dialogue.\n\nViewer discretion advisories are mostly used for programs rated TV-MA or series where most episodes are TV-14-rated with lighter content, where content may be unusual for the tone the series or event may usually have or for strong content. They are also commonly used for television broadcasts of theatrical films; this, however, depends highly on the content and rating (alternatively, said content might also be edited out).\n\n\n"}

A shear load is a force that tends to produce a sliding failure on a material along a plane that is parallel to the direction of the force. When a paper is cut with scissors, the paper fails in shear.\n\nIn structural and mechanical engineering, the shear strength of a component is important for designing the dimensions and materials to be used for the manufacture or construction of the component (e.g. beams, plates, or bolts). In a reinforced concrete beam, the main purpose of reinforcing bar (rebar) stirrups is to increase the shear strength.\n\nFor shear stress formula_1 applies\n\nwhere\n\nIn general: ductile materials (e.g. aluminum) fail in shear, whereas brittle materials (e.g. cast iron) fail in tension. See tensile strength.\n\nTo calculate:\n\nGiven total force at failure (F) and the force-resisting area (e.g. the cross-section of a bolt loaded in shear), ultimate shear strength (formula_1) is:\n\nFor average shear stress\n\nformula_7\n\nwhere\n\nAverage shear stress can also be defined as the total force of formula_9 as\n\nThis is only the average stress, actual stress distribution is not uniform. In real world applications, this equation only gives an approximation and the maximum shear stress would be higher. Stress is not often equally distributed across a part so the shear strength would need to be higher to account for the estimate. \n\nAs a very rough guide relating tensile, yield, and shear strengths:\n\nThere are no published standard values for shear strength like with tensile and yield strength. Instead, it is common for it to be estimated as 60% of the ultimate tensile strength. Shear strength can be measures by a torsion test where it is equal to there torsional strength.\nWhen values measured from physical samples are desired, a number of testing standards are available, covering different material categories and testing conditions. In the US, ASTM standards for measuring shear strength include ASTM B831, D732, D4255, D5379, and D7078. Internationally, ISO testing standards for shear strength include ISO 3597, 12579, and 14130.\n\n"}

Newby, known as Howard Newby, was born in Crowborough, Sussex on 25 June 1918 and was educated at Hanley Castle Grammar School in Worcestershire, and St Paul's College of Education in Cheltenham. In October 1939 he was sent to France to serve in World War II as a private in the Royal Army Medical Corps. His unit was one of the last to be evacuated.

He was the original sidekick for Alan Scott (the first Green Lantern), appearing in comic book stories starring that hero from 1941 to 1949.\n\nThe character was created by writer Bill Finger and artist Irwin Hasen. In a 2017 interview, Hasen said: \n\nKurt Mitchell and Roy Thomas write that Doiby was \"the first of the comic relief sidekicks that came to define the [All-American] approach to super-heroics in the early '40s.\"\n\nDoiby's first adventure with Green Lantern occurs when Doiby follows the Lantern while he was trailing a group of thugs. After Green Lantern was supposedly killed by the thugs, Doiby confronts them in a Green Lantern costume in an attempt to stop them. Soon after, the actual Green Lantern appears and, with the help of Doiby, saves the day. After that adventure, Green Lantern sent Doiby a quaint letter: \"Doiby, I could use a good man like you to help me in my fight against all evil — How about it? -The Green Lantern\". After that, Doiby began working with Alan Scott on a regular basis eventually learning that the Green Lantern and Alan Scott were one and the same.\n\nDoiby and Alan later try to assist the creature known as Solomon Grundy during his first appearance. It does not go well as Grundy goes on a murderous rampage and must be destroyed. He seemingly meets his end under the wheels of a train. This adventure also has a backup Hop Harrigan story, as did many of Doiby's 'All American Comics' adventures.\n\nDoiby and the Green Lantern had many adventures together, including taking on the Nazis in the WWII era. With his thick Brooklyn accent, Doiby invariably addresses Green Lantern as \"Lan'trin\". As a cab driver, Doiby's slogan is \"Soivice that don't make youse noivice\". He refers to his cab as 'Goitrude'. Doiby often assists in battle with a skilled swing of a pipe wrench. Alan Scott later becomes the head of Gotham Broadcasting, a radio station based out of Gotham City. He brings in Doiby as his personal assistant. Doiby becomes involved with Princess Raima of Myrg, an alien who flees to Earth to escape a forced marriage to an evil man named Prince Peril. He gets his friends involved, who help rescue her but not before Doiby serves time as a court jester.\n\nAs the Golden Age began to fade, Doiby was sent into space to marry Princess Ramia, the aliens enjoying his vast wisdom, and Alan Scott went on with his solo career. Myrg comes to resemble Doiby's beloved Brooklyn.\n\nHe briefly returns to Earth to assist the Green Lanterns in a new problem: Sinestro has possessed his taxi. He had left it behind in Hal Jordan's garage when he went to Myrg. The threat is eventually neutralized but Goitrude is destroyed. Doiby had traveled to Earth with a 'dimension-change' but this device is lost in the confrontation. Later, Goitrude is repaired.\n\nDoiby continues to live as king until his position was usurped by the evil Prince Marieb.\n\nSometime later, Doiby joins a group called \"Old Justice\". It is made up of the 'sidekicks' of many Golden Age heroes. There is Dan the Dyna-Mite, Merry Pemberton, Neptune Perkins and the two children of Ma Hunkel. They are convinced that the younger superheroes are not responsible enough to be involved in 'the game'.\n\nDuring the \"Sins of Youth\" storyline, one of Doiby's alien devices combines with the magic from Klarion the Witch Boy. This serves to alter the ages of dozens of superheroes and supervillains. Older characters become much younger and the teens become adults. Doiby and other members of Old Justice find themselves having to herd and baby-sit adults-turned-kids, many of whom have become vastly irresponsible. They are assisted by some of the now-adult super-beings. Basing themselves out of the old JLA headquarters in Happy Harbor, the adults and kids eventually find a way to blackmail Klarion into working with Doiby to reverse the changes. This incident convinces Old Justice that Young Justice can take care of themselves.\n\nDoiby reunites with the team because of the coincidence of Young Justice using the older hero's meeting spots. He convinces them to take him back to the planet Myrg. Impulse had recently received a spaceship in return for helping a rich sultan. While traveling through space, a younger version of Lobo talks his way into joining the mission. As is usual for Lobo, he is in it for the violence.\n\nAfter arriving, the team realizes Marieb had caused Doiby to be exiled from Mryg. Ramia had married the villain for the guarantee Doiby would be left alive. Marieb is defeated but the threat of the alien Slag arrives.\n\nThe Slag race enjoys the game of baseball and agrees that they would face down Young Justice and Doiby for the sake of the planet. The Young Justice team wins by blatant cheating. Doiby and his Queen are able to go back to ruling Myrg.\n\nDoiby appears one more time to see Young Justice off in friendly terms. They use another form of transport, accidentally leaving Impulse's ship on Myrg.\n\nDoiby made a brief appearance in \"DC 1st\" with Alan Scott.\n\nA three-parter in \"Detective Comics\" features a flashback of Alan Scott and Doiby investigating murders in 1948.\n\nDoiby Dickles has no superpowers but he's a skilled street fighter and driver. He used his taxi to drive Green Lantern to any location and/or during car chases. Sometimes, while fighting, he used a pipe wrench as a weapon which allowed him to knock out his enemies.

{"id": "2260967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260967", "title": "Renata Beger", "text": "Renata Beger\n\nRenata Lidia Beger (born 18 July 1958, in Silno, Pomeranian Voivodeship) is a Polish politician, a prominent member of the populist political party Samoobrona and a member of the Sejm (lower chamber of the Polish parliament) between 2001 and 2007.\n\nBeger became a vice-chairman of the local Wielkopolska voivodship Samoobrona board in 1992, and served in that function until 2001, when she was elected to the Sejm as a representative for the Piła district. She gained some media attention, as well as became an object of ridicule, mostly due to her relatively low education for a member of Parliament (see below) and lack of experience with affairs of state, as well as devout support for her party's leader, Andrzej Lepper.\n\nBeger's gained more notoriety when she was delegated by her party to serve in a special committee set up to investigate a major corruption scandal that marred the fourth term of the Polish parliament, the Rywin affair. The committee's sittings, which included hearings of witnesses, were televised live and became some of the most publicized and discussed events in Poland at their time. Beger became notorious for her unique style of conducting those and very unusual questions, and her alleged lack of knowledge or experience in many areas the committee was dealing with.\n\nDuring her first term in parliament, Beger was accused of counterfeiting signatures on the lists of citizens supporting her parliamentary candidacy (required to register as a candidate in Poland). In November 2003, as the issue became pursued by a prosecutor, Beger renounced her legal immunity as a member of the Sejm, as well as was expelled from the special committee in October. Formal proceedings began only in November 2004, and extended well into Beger's second term. She was formally convicted of counterfeit on 30 June 2006 and sentence of 2 years of incarceration suspended for 5 years.\n\nDespite the legal proceedings against her, Beger got reelected to Sejm riding on her acquired popularity. During the term, as a Samoobrona representative, she found herself a member of the parliamentary coalition supporting the Law and Justice party (PiS)-led governments of first Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz and then Prawo i Sprawiedliwość chairman, Jarosław Kaczyński.\n\nThe coalition was marred by tensions between its members, and finally collapsed when Andrzej Lepper, the leader of Samoobrona, repeatedly vowed that he and his party would not support the budget proposition approved by the Council of Ministers. This led to Kaczyński deposing Lepper of his post of deputy prime minister, but at the same time in need of parliamentary majority to support the government. As none of the remaining parties present in the Sejm would, or could, replace the Samoobrona in supporting Kaczyński's cabinet, PiS had to resort to convince individual Samoobrona representatives to defect from the party in order to vote in favor of the government, which led to accusations of unethical dealing on their side.\n\nOn 26 September 2006 the TVN television channel broadcast, as a part of the \"Teraz My\" (Now We) show, footage recorded by Beger using a hidden camera, of her in an informal conversation with government minister Adam Lipiński, discussing possible nomination Beger could receive for defecting from Samoobrona to support and remain in the government coalition. The talks, initiated by Beger, involved the possibility of acquiring a government post. Support with current legal proceedings against her, as shown on tape, were rejected by government minister Adam Lipiński.\n\nIn an opinion poll conducted immediately after the footage was revealed, 66% of the respondents defined PiS politicians' actions as \"political corruption\" and the same percentage demanded the Kaczyński government to resign. Beger filed a motion for prosecution against PiS. Another poll showed that 58% of Poles see the actions as a provocation of political opponents, rather than explicit \"corruption\".\n\nIn the 2007 early parliamentary elections, called after the final collapse of the coalition government, Samoobrona failed to pass the 5% electoral threshold, required to be represented in the Sejm. Therefore, along with her party colleagues, Renata Beger is no longer a member of the Polish parliament.\n\nRenata Beger is one of the most known, as well as controversial, politicians in Poland, not only for her political activity, but also for her personality traits. She is often very frank in her opinions. In her first term in parliament, in an interview for the \"Super Express\" tabloid, she expanded on her sexual life with her husband, and declared she loved sex \"like horse liked oats\". Her attempts at formal speeches were often failed due to gaffes such as calling United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan \"Annan Kofan\" on TV. Beger was frequently ridiculed by satirists and some artists, including singers and bands such as Paweł Kukiz or Big Cyc recording songs devoted to her.\n\nBeger famously skipped a sitting of her special parliamentary committee in order to attend a recording of a popular talk show as a celebrity guest. Over time, Beger became a popular celebrity, appearing in TV programmes and displaying a more cultivated image, including her participation in a charity fashion show as a model or in a TV dance show.\n\nBeger formally has only basic secondary education, and did not even have the matura upon being elected for the first time.

{"id": "2260970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260970", "title": "MP 34", "text": "MP 34\n\nThe MP34 (\"Maschinenpistole 34\", literally \"Machine Pistol 34\") is a submachine gun (SMG) that was manufactured by \"Waffenfabrik Steyr\" as Steyr-Solothurn S1-100 and used by the Austrian Gendarmerie and subsequently by units of the German Army and the \"Waffen SS\", in World War II. An exceptionally well-made weapon, it was used by some forces well into the 1970s.\n\nThe MP 34 was based on a design for the MP 18 by the Rheinmetall company based in Düsseldorf. The weapon is similar in design to the MP 18 Bergmann, which itself saw service towards the end of World War I.\n\nRestrictions on the manufacture of certain armaments within the 1919 Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany from manufacturing certain types of weapons, such as light automatic firearms (designated as SMGs with barrels in excess of four inches (102 mm) and magazines holding more than eight rounds). To circumvent the treaty, Rheinmetall acquired the Swiss company \"Waffenfabrik Solothurn\" in 1929 and began secret production of a prototype. What was to become the MP 34 was originally designated ‘S1-100’ using the company's standard naming convention.\n\nDue to the Solothurn company being unsuited for mass production, Rheinmetall took a controlling interest in \"Waffenfabrik Steyr\", an established arms manufacturer in Austria. Weapons manufactured by Steyr were sold via the Zurich-based trade company \"Steyr-Solothurn Waffen AG\" to both the commercial and military markets.\n\nThe MP 34 was manufactured from the very best materials available and finished to the highest possible standard. It was so well manufactured that it has often been nicknamed the \"Rolls Royce of submachine guns\". However, its production costs were extremely high as a consequence.\n\nThe MP34 was a selective-fire weapon (single shot or full auto), firing in blowback mode with an open bolt. The return spring was located in the wooden stock and was linked to the bolt via a long push rod, attached via a pivot to the rear of the bolt. Easy access to the bolt and trigger assembly was via a hinged top cover which opened up and forward by depressing two release catches. This makes cleaning procedures very easy to perform.\n\nOn the left-hand side of the stock was a sliding fire selector switch (marked by letters T and S). Initial production runs of the gun had a Schmeisser-style bolt-locking safety (similar to the MP40) in the form of hook-shaped cut which was used to engage the bolt handle when the bolt was cocked (which was notoriously unsafe). Later models included a manual safety on the top cover, just in front of the rear sight. This safety could lock the weapon in both a cocked or closed position.\n\n32- or 20-round box magazines were fed in from the left side and the magazine housing was angled slightly forward to improve cartridge feeding to prevent jams. Additionally, the same magazine housing incorporated a magazine refilling feature. An empty magazine could be inserted from underneath and locked in place. From above stripper clips (of 8 rounds each) could be fed into the magazines.\n\nAll MP34s were equipped with a wooden stock with a semi-pistol grip. The barrel was enclosed into a perforated cooling jacket, and had a bayonet-fixing lug on the right-hand side. Front (hooded) and rear rifle-type sights were fitted – the latter marked from 100 to 500 meters.\n\nSome versions of the weapon could be fitted with a detachable tripod for use as a machine gun.\n\nIn 1930, the Austrian police accepted the S1-100 as the Steyr MP30, chambered for then standard Austrian 9×23mm Steyr pistol rounds. The guns sold to South America, China and Japan were in 7.63x25 Mauser calibre.\n\nThe Austrian Army adopted the Steyr-Solothurn S1-100 as the Steyr MP34, chambered for the powerful 9×25mm Mauser ammunition.\n\nWith the 1938 Anschluss between Germany and Austria, the German Army acquired most of available MP30s and MP34s. A number were then re-barrelled to chamber 9×19 ammunition and issued to German troops as the MP34(ö) – \"Maschinenpistole 34 österreichisch\" (literally \"Machine-pistol 34, Austrian\"). Production of the MP34 ceased in mid-1940, and manufacturing lines at Steyr moved over to the production of the MP40 – a much simpler designed weapon and far less expensive to produce than the MP34. As a substitute standard small arm, it had a relatively short combat service once quantities of the MP38 became available, though some MP34s were used by Waffen SS units in the early stages of the war in Poland and France. It was then allocated to line-of-communications and reserve units, including military police and \"Feldgendarmerie\" detachments.\n\nIn Greece, various police forces under the Ministry of Security, notably the mechanized police, were equipped with the S1-100 in 9×25mm Mauser caliber. In Yugoslavia, both the Partisans and the Chetniks used captured ex-German Solothurn MP34s.\n\nPortugal bought in small quantities the .45 ACP version and was adopted as Pistola-metralhadora 11,43mm m/935. Portugal also purchased small quantities of the S1-100 in 7.65x21mm Luger calibre in 1938, and the weapon was adopted as the Pistola-metralhadora 7,65 mm m/938 Steyer submachine gun. In 1941 and 1942, larger numbers of 9mm MP34 guns were delivered to Portugal by Germany. In Portuguese service, the 9mm MP34 was known as the Pistola-metralhadora 9 mm m/942 Steyer. Many m/942 guns carry a Portuguese crest just forward of the safety mechanism in combination with \"Waffenamt\" (WaA) markings. The m/942 remained in service with Portuguese Army into the 1950s, and was used until the 1970s by paramilitary and security forces in Portugal's overseas African colonies during the Portuguese Colonial Wars.\n\nDuring the late 1930s, Japan imported a limited number of MP 34s for testing and limited issue.\n\n"}
{"id": "2260971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260971", "title": "Hitler Youth Quex", "text": "Hitler Youth Quex\n\nHitler Youth Quex () is a 1932 Nazi propaganda novel based on the life of Herbert \"“Quex”\" Norkus. The 1933 film \"\" was based on it and was described by Joseph Goebbels as the \"first large-scale\" transmission of Nazi ideology using the medium of cinema. Both the book and the film, like \"S.A.-Mann Brand\" and \"Hans Westmar\", both released the same year, fictionalised and glorified death in the service of the Nazi Party and Adolf Hitler.\n\nBoth the novel and film are based on the real story of Herbert Norkus' life. Norkus, a Hitler Youth member, had died from injuries suffered while being chased and confronted by Communist youths in the night of 23/24 January 1932 in the Beusselkietz neighbourhood of Moabit, Berlin. Already on the next morning, Joseph Goebbels began to use Norkus' death for propaganda purposes during a rally in Berlin's \"Sportpalast\". The funeral on 29 January at Plötzensee, Berlin, was turned into a major ceremony of several Nazi party organizations, under the aegis of Goebbels. While the murder was condemned also by non-Nazi press, the Communists started a counter-propaganda offensive, describing the incident as an accidental result of Communist self-defence during a Nazi attack. In the subsequent trial, several people were sentenced by the \"Landgericht I\" court in Moabit, yet the most prominent accomplices Willi Simon, Bernhard Klingbeil and Harry Tack had been able to escape to the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter the Nazis assumed power, the grave of Norkus was turned into a Nazi shrine which was visited annually on New Year's Day by Nazi youth leader Baldur von Schirach for a speech that was broadcast nationwide. To the site of Norkus' death at Zwinglistraße 4, a plaque was attached reading \"\"He Gave His Life For Germany's Freedom\"\", the first of several such memorial plaques subsequently placed throughout Germany. 24 January was made remembrance day for all killed Hitler Youths, and the flag of Norkus' unit became the Hitler Youth's \"blood flag\". Two weeks after the Enabling Act of 1933, a provocative Hitler Youth march to Norkus' grave took the route through Berlin's communist districts of Wedding and Moabit. Throughout Germany, the Nazis organized demonstrations and speeches commemorating their newly created martyr. Novels, plays, poems and songs were written about him.\n\nThe novel \"Der Hitlerjunge Quex\" was written by Karl Aloys Schenzinger between May and September 1932. It was first published in Nazi party newspaper \"Völkischer Beobachter\", and as a book in December 1932. A required reading for Hitler Youth members, more than 190,000 copies were sold within the first two years, and more than 500,000 copies until 1945.\n\nIn Schenzinger's novel, Herbert Norkus is named Heini Völker. With a \"völkisch\" undertone, the opening chapters describe the hardships of Norkus' youth in a working class district of Berlin, characterised by the Great Depression, the unemployment of his father and the suicide of his mother. The contemporary communist youth (\"Rote Jungfront\", \"Red Young Front\") is portrayed as a disorderly gang devoted primarily to alcohol, tobacco and sex. In contrast, the Nazi youth (\"Hitlerjugend\", \"Hitler Youth\") is portrayed as an orderly organisation, superior in morals. Schenzinger lets Heini Völker's father force his son to attend a camping weekend organised by a communist youth group, North Star Moabit. Heini is disgusted and flees the camp, only to encounter a Hitler Youth group in the woods. Deeply impressed, and in an atmosphere of nationalistic pathos, Heini learns of the Nazi movement, \"Führerprinzip\" (\"leader principle\"), comradeship and \"Volksgemeinschaft\" (\"the people's community\"). On \"the happiest day of his life\", Heini joins the Hitler Youth, and Schenzinger has the Bannführer (group leader) symbolize Nazi ideology when he handed over Heini's uniform to him: \"\"[The uniform] is the clothing of the community, of comradeship, of our ideology, of our unified organisation! [...] It makes us all equal, and gives the same to all and demands the same from all. He who wears such a uniform does not have desires of his own anymore, he has only to obey.\"\"\n\nThe following chapters deal with Heini's life as a Hitler Youth. Obedience and equality as understood by the Nazis are portrayed in a very positive light. They turn out to be beneficial not only for Heini, but also for his comrades, for example, his best friend \"Fritz Dörries\", the son of a wealthy merchant. Emphasis is put on the vision of self-sacrifice, the abolition of social barriers, and racial purity, and Heini learns from Fritz that \"\"with us Hitler Youth, there are no classes. There are only those who get the job done and parasites, and those we'll throw out.\"\" The haven Heini found in the Hitler Youth is symbolised by his group's hang-out, \"Castle Beusselkietz\" - Norkus' group was \"Schar 2, Hitlerjugend Beusselkietz-Hansa\". His comrades nicknamed him \"Quex\" because \"he carried out orders faster than quicksilver\" ().\n\nThe last part of the novel is devoted to the circumstances of Norkus' (or Heini Völker's) death. According to Baird (1992), Schenzinger's version is a \"thinly veiled parallel to Resurrection\": When his comrades were gathered around his death bed and wonder whether he is still alive, there \"\"suddenly [...] is a scream. Heini is sitting up in bed, his eyes wide open. He is singing. They don't recognise the words, but they know the melody. It's the song they sing every day, every evening together, on every march. Everyone knows what it means - death is singing here.\"\"\n\nThe novel provided the basis for a subsequent film version, produced in the Universum Film AG (Ufa) studios. The plot was written by Bobby E. Lüthge and Karl Aloys Schenzinger, the author of the novel. Produced by Karl Ritter, the film was supported by the Nazi leadership and produced for 320,000 reichsmarks under the aegis of Baldur von Schirach. The latter also wrote the lyrics for the Hitler Youth song \"\"Unsere Fahne flattert uns voran\"\", based on an existing melody by Hans-Otto Borgmann, who was also responsible for the music. The director was Hans Steinhoff. For the film, the novel's title was amended with the subtitle \"Ein Film vom Opfergeist der deutschen Jugend\" (\"A film about the sacrificial spirit of German youth\"). The film has a length of 95 minutes (2,605 metres) and was premiered on 11 September 1933 at the Ufa-Phoebus Palace, Munich, and on 19 September at the Ufa-Palast am Zoo, Berlin. It was one of three films about Nazi martyrs in 1933, the other two being \"SA-Mann Brand\" and \"Hans Westmar\", and by January 1934 had been viewed by a million people.\n\nThe film's message is characterised by its final words, \"\"The flag means more than death\"\".\n\n"}

He previously served as Israel's economic envoy to the United States from 2005 to 2008, a position requiring him to give up his American citizenship, and subsequently served as senior adviser to current Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for four years. On July 9, 2013 Dermer was confirmed by the government of Israel as Israel's ambassador to the United States, replacing Michael Oren. He began serving as Israel's Ambassador to the United States in October 2013. In July 2019, it was announced that the Israeli Civil Service Commission would not extend his term and that Dermer will resign as Ambassador to the United States in September 2019.\n\nRon Dermer was born and raised in Miami Beach, Florida, as the younger son of Yaffa Rosenthal, who was born in Mandatory Palestine and moved to Florida with her parents shortly after Israel won its independence, and Jay Dermer, a trial lawyer from New York City, who became mayor of Miami Beach in the late 1960s. Dermer went to a Jewish day school. In 1984, two weeks before his bar mitzvah, his father died of a heart attack. His brother David Dermer, a Democrat like his father, also served as mayor of Miami Beach.\n\nDermer earned a B.S. in Finance and Management from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1993, and a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) from Oxford University in 1996. In 1995, while still at Oxford, he helped manage Natan Sharansky's Yisrael b'Aliyah 1996 Knesset election campaign. In 1996 Dermer moved to Israel, and in 1997, he began the process of becoming an Israeli citizen. On August 9, 1998, he married artist Adi Blumberg, the daughter of then chairman of the Bank of Jerusalem who had grown up in the Old City of Jerusalem. The wedding was presided over by Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz. Adi Blumberg died in February 2000.\n\nDermer worked as a political consultant for Natan Sharansky in the 1999 campaign, and from January 2001 for nearly three years he wrote a column \"The Numbers Game\" for \"The Jerusalem Post\". In 2004, he and Sharansky co-wrote the best-selling book \"The Case For Democracy: The Power of Freedom to Overcome Tyranny and Terror\", famously endorsed by then US-President George W. Bush. In 2005, while Benjamin Netanyahu served as Finance Minister under Ariel Sharon, Dermer was appointed economic envoy at the Israeli embassy in Washington, a post for which he had to give up his American citizenship. In 2008, after his return to Israel, he became adviser to Netanyahu, who became Israel's prime minister in April 2009. Dermer is considered Netanyahu's closest adviser and strategic consultant. According to \"The Jerusalem Post\", he \"runs much of the interference with the White House, and is intimately involved in the diplomatic process with the Palestinians, [... and] writes many of Netanyahu’s speeches\".\n\nIsraeli newspaper \"Makor Rishon\" reported on December 28, 2012 that Dermer's name was being floated as a potential replacement for Michael Oren, Israel's Ambassador to the United States. The Prime Minister's Office declined to comment on the report and the Embassy of Israel in Washington spokesman called the report \"baseless.\" In March 2013, Dermer left the Prime Minister's Office after four years as Netanyahu's senior adviser. On July 9, 2013 the Prime Minister's office announced that Dermer would replace Oren as Israel's ambassador to the United States.\n\nRegional observers and Washington political analyst see Dermer's appointment as a \"mixed bag\" for U.S.–Israel relations. According to Ari Shavit, Dermer is one of the few people Prime Minister Netanyahu trusts enough for the job, and Dermer's understanding of the American political system gives Netanyahu a way to navigate through Washington tactfully. On the other hand, Barak Ravid said, Dermer is suspected by key White House aides Denis McDonough and Ben Rhodes of lobbying members of Congress against President Barack Obama's positions.\n\nIn January 2015 the Israeli Civil Service Commission censured Dermer for taking part in political campaigning for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in violation of Civil Service rules. The U. S. Administration took the unusual step of sharply criticizing the ambassador, after he played a key role in having Benjamin Netanyahu invited, without White House knowledge, to address Congress on Iran, in what the Administration regards as a breach of protocol. A spokesman said that the ambassador repeatedly put Netanyahu’s political interests before those of the relationship between Israel and the United States. In December 2015 Dermer received press coverage for his \"politically charged\" choice of holiday gifts sent from the Israeli Embassy, which he publicized as coming from occupied West Bank and Golan Heights.\n\nIn December 2016 he was criticized for accepting an award from the controversial Center for Security Policy, a conservative think tank led by Frank Gaffney, which was designated as a hate group by the SPLC. The SPLC encouraged Dermer to decline the award because it \"not only further legitimizes this organization, but could be read as an endorsement of anti-Muslim hate by the Israeli government.\" For his part, in his acceptance speech, Dermer criticized the SPLC for calling Gaffney, Daniel Pipes, Maajid Nawaz, Ayaan Hirsi Ali and others anti-Muslim extremists. During his speech Dermer described \"militant Islam\" as a \"virulent ideology now ascendant in the Muslim world\".\n\nIn September 2018, the Israeli Civil Service Commission began an investigation into Dermer's handling of information regarding possible sexual harassment issues related to an employee Israel hired. In July 2019, it was announced that the Commission rejected a request by Netanyahu and would not extend Dermer's term as Israel's Ambassador to the United States. \n\nDermer married artist Adi Blumberg in 1998. Two years later she died at the age of 29. Dermer met current wife Rhoda Pagano, a Yale Law School graduate, in Jerusalem when she was clerking for Aharon Barak, then Chief Justice of the Israeli Supreme Court.\n\nThey have five children and live in Jerusalem.\n\n\n"}

It co-stars Katherine Helmond, Fritz Weaver, Fionnula Flanagan, and Hayden Rorke. It premiered on ABC on February 10, 1975. The film was nominated for a Golden Globe award for Best Motion Picture Made for Television in 1976.\n\nThe film, although based on fact, is a stylized retelling of the events of August 4, 1892 when the father and step-mother of New England spinster Lizzie Borden were found brutally murdered in their Fall River, Massachusetts home. Public interest in Borden and the murders is exacerbated by her aloof demeanor after the murders, and the public speculate about her involvement when she fails to express emotion at her father and stepmother's funerals.\n\nThe subsequent incarceration of the prime suspect (Lizzie herself) as well as the coroner's inquest and trial are largely faithfully depicted, using actual testimony. During the trial, various persons testify, including Bridget Sullivan, the Borden's maid from Ireland who was the only other person in the home at the time of the murders.\n\nIn what may be seen as deviation from the film's docudrama narrative, as Lizzie hears her verdict, flashbacks are shown of her actually committing the murders in the nude and bathing after each death, thus explaining why no blood was ever found on her or her clothes; however, it is left ambiguous whether Lizzie was actually reminiscing about the crimes or simply fantasizing how she herself would have disposed of her victims. when Lizzie returns home after acquittal, her sister Emma asks her point-blank if she killed their parents; Lizzie does not answer. The epilogue states that the killings of Andrew and Abby Borden remain unsolved.\n\n\nElizabeth Montgomery and Lizzie Borden were sixth cousins once removed, both descending from 17th-century Massachusetts resident John Luther. Rhonda McClure, the genealogist who documented the Montgomery-Borden connection, said, \"I wonder how Elizabeth would have felt if she knew she was playing her own cousin.\" One of the gowns worn by Montgomery in the film is on display at the bed-and-breakfast that now occupies the Borden house.\n\nIrish actress Fionnula Flanagan was cast in the part of the Borden's maid, Bridget Sullivan, who was originally from Ireland.\n\nThe film won writer William Bast the 1975 Edgar Award for Best TV Feature/Miniseries. It also won two Emmy Awards, for Costume Design (presented to Guy C. Verhille) and Film Editing (John A. Martinelli), and received nominations in three other Emmy categories: Lead Actress (Montgomery), Art Direction (Jack De Shields), and Sound Editing (Harry Gordon).\n\nThe film was also nominated for Best Motion Picture Made for Television in the 1976 Golden Globe Awards.\n\nThe European theatrical version is more explicit than the one broadcast on ABC, showing Borden nude in the scenes where she kills her parents. This version also runs an extra 4 minutes, 104 minutes total versus the United States version of 100 minutes.\n\nA Region 1 DVD release of the film was released on October 7, 2014 and is now available for purchase.\n"}
{"id": "2260992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2260992", "title": "Chen Gong", "text": "Chen Gong\n\nChen Gong () (died 7 February 199), courtesy name Gongtai, was an adviser to the warlord Lü Bu in the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. However, he had started his career under another warlord, Cao Cao, before defecting to Lü Bu. He was executed along with Lü Bu after Cao Cao defeated Lü Bu at the Battle of Xiapi.\n\nChen Gong was given a positive makeover in the 14th-century historical novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\", which romanticises the events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. In the novel, Chen Gong initially held office as a minor magistrate under the Han government, but he gave up his job after deciding to follow Cao Cao, who was then on the run after attempting to assassinate Dong Zhuo, a tyrannical warlord who was holding the Emperor hostage. However, after witnessing Cao Cao killing Lü Boshe, he secretly left Cao Cao and ultimately joined Lü Bu. His eventual fate in the novel is similar to that in history.\n\nChen Gong was from Wuyang County (), Dong Commandery, which is located at the border between present-day Henan and Shandong provinces. He joined Cao Cao around 190, at the time when regional warlords around China formed a coalition against Dong Zhuo, a powerful warlord who held Emperor Xian hostage in the imperial capital, Luoyang. Chen Gong's most significant contribution while serving Cao Cao was the taking over of Yan Province (兖州; covering present-day western Shandong) in 193 through diplomatic efforts, a strategic move which laid down the foundation for Cao Cao's subsequent rise in power.\n\nIn 194, however, while Cao Cao was away on a campaign against Tao Qian in Xu Province (徐州; covering present-day northern Jiangsu), Chen Gong defected to a rival warlord, Lü Bu, along with his colleague, Zhang Miao. With the assistance of the two defectors, Lü Bu quickly took over most of Yan Province. Cao Cao hastily returned and laid siege on Lü Bu in Puyang (). After more than hundred days of stalemate, a famine forced Lü Bu to give up his position and seek refuge under Liu Bei in Xiapi (下邳; present-day Pizhou, Jiangsu), capital of Xu Province.\n\nIn 196, Lü Bu turned on his host and took over Xiapi, proclaiming himself the governor of Xu Province and sending Liu Bei to the nearby county of Xiaopei ().\n\nIn 198, Lü Bu launched an offensive against Liu Bei, who sought help from Cao Cao. This was one of Cao Cao's plots for he much desired the Xu Province. He placed two spies in Lü Bu's camp to sow discord between Lü Bu, Liu Bei and Chen Gong. These spies became the left and right advisers to Lü Bu and told him to attack Liu Bei. This was all against Chen Gong's advice. Cao Cao personally led his forces to attack Xiapi. When Cao Cao's army reached Pengcheng (彭城; present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu), which was located east of Xiapi, Chen Gong advised Lü Bu to grasp the initiative to strike because he didn't know of Cao Cao's ploy but Lü Bu, heeding his wife's advice, decided to stay put. After initial attempts to break the siege failed, Lü Bu intended to surrender but was dissuaded by Chen Gong.\n\nThe siege dragged on for two months until Cao Cao ordered his troops to dig ditches to divert the Si River and Yi River () to flood Xiapi. On 7 February 199, Lü Bu's subjects Hou Cheng, Song Xian () and Wei Xu () captured Chen Gong and defected with their troops. Lü Bu made a last stand on the city gate but was eventually overpowered and captured. When brought to Cao Cao, Chen Gong refused to return to his service and chose death so that the law could be upheld; Cao Cao had maintained a general rule that those who surrendered to him, \"after\" rejecting an initial call from him to surrender, would not be spared. Cao Cao was moved and provided for Chen Gong's family after Chen's death.\n\nThe heads of Lü Bu, Chen Gong, Gao Shun and some of Lü Bu's other followers were sent to Xuchang.\n\n\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\", a 14th-century historical novel by Luo Guanzhong, is a romanticisation of the events that occurred before and during the Three Kingdoms period. In this dramatised version of history, Chen Gong was credited with much undue moral righteousness and craftiness, perhaps to accentuate the unscrupulousness of Cao Cao and incompetence of Lü Bu.\n\nThe first incident that illustrates the righteousness of Chen Gong comes in Chapter 4, where Cao Cao was fleeing from Luoyang after a foiled assassination attempt on Dong Zhuo. At Zhongmu County, where Chen Gong was serving as the county magistrate, Cao Cao was captured. When Chen Gong interrogated the fugitive, he was so impressed with Cao Cao's loyalty to the Emperor that he decided to abandon his job and join Cao Cao, who planned to return to his home in Chenliu (陳留; around present-day Kaifeng, Henan) to raise an army against Dong Zhuo.\n\nAlong the journey, they passed by the house of Lü Boshe, a sworn brother of Cao Cao's father. There, they killed Lü Boshe's family by mistake, while Cao Cao personally murdered Lü in cold blood later. Chen Gong was shocked by what he witnessed. That night, as Cao Cao slept, Chen Gong considered killing him, but thought it unrighteous to do so. He instead left Cao Cao and travelled to his own hometown of in Dong Commandery (東郡; near present-day Puyang, Henan).\n\nChen Gong's most brilliant, albeit fictitious, manoeuvre came during the Battle of Puyang, when Cao Cao's forces laid siege on Lü Bu in Puyang (). The incident was described in Chapter 12. Chen Gong, who was then serving Lü Bu, plotted to lure Cao Cao into the city by having a local send a letter to Cao Cao feigning to collude with the latter. The delighted Cao Cao personally led a force deep into the city before realising he had fallen into a trap. At a signal, fires were lit at all the city gates and Lü Bu's troops cut off the evasion routes. Cao Cao barely escaped with his life in the battle and had a narrow face-to-face encounter with Lü Bu, who did not recognise him and allowed him to slip away. Later in Chapter 60, when Zhang Song visited Cao Cao as an emissary from the warlord Liu Zhang, he mocked Cao Cao's past failures by mentioning the Battle of Puyang and other notable battles that Cao Cao lost.\n\nChen Gong appears as a character in the Hong Kong manhua \"The Ravages of Time\" illustrated by Chan Mou.\n\n\n\n"}

He became head of the English department in 1927. While working as a teacher, King studied part-time for his Ph.D. His thesis was on the Folios of Shakespeare. He received his doctorate from King's College London in 1940. He had been excused from military service during World War II due to a duodenal ulcer. He and his family - first wife Victoria Florence (née Harris) and daughter Margaret - and Taunton's school were evacuated to Bournemouth from Southampton in 1940. Among the many pupils was 15-year-old Benny Hill. Dr King (\"Doc\") was always a keen musician - piano, piano-accordion and organ - and during the 2nd World War he formed various concert parties - \"The V Concert Party\" was one - which toured the smaller outlying military bases and entertained troops not often reached by ENSA.\n\nHe also raised funds by organising concerts to \"buy\" Spitfires and send aid to Russia. He is believed to have instigated fund raising in Hampshire by letters he wrote to the \"Hampshire Chronicle\" in July and August 1940. His \"Spitfire Song\" was recorded by Joe Loss and his Orchestra. He and a teacher colleague also were the first to translate \"Lili Marlene\" but were too slow to get their version to the song-publishing market. He left Taunton's in 1947 to become headteacher of Regent's Park Secondary School.\n\nKing first stood as a Labour party candidate in the 1945 general election. Labour won with a massive landslide, but King was unsuccessful in his attempt to take the ultra-safe Conservative seat of New Forest and Christchurch. The following year he was elected to Hampshire County Council, on which he served until 1965 with only a single three-year break. His wife, Victoria Florence King, was also politically active - a town councillor and Mayor of Southampton in coronation year, 1953. She received a posthumous OBE.\n\nIn the 1950 general election, King successfully fought the newly created Southampton Test seat, albeit with a very small majority. He successfully defended the seat in the 1951 election, which had been called after Labour's 1950 majority had proved unworkable. However, at the 1955 election, King switched his candidacy to the far safer neighbouring seat of Southampton Itchen, where he was re-elected until he left Parliament in 1971. During his time in Parliament he established links with the USA and Canada and lectured there on the British Constitution and Parliament. During one lecture trip in Georgia he and Dr Martin Luther King appeared on a local TV station together under the billing of \"The Two Dr Kings\". He was instrumental in gaining UK support for the UNESCO project of the raising of the temples at Abu Simbel after the flooding of the Nile by the Aswan dam. He promoted bills on corneal grafts and attempted to raise awareness in the 1960s of autism. A keen European, he served in the Council of Europe.\n\nWhen Harold Wilson was elected as the first Labour Prime Minister for 13 years in 1964, King was selected as the Chairman of Ways and Means and the Deputy Speaker.\n\nOn 9 September 1965 he was elected Speaker of the House of Commons, a position he held until his retirement on 12 January 1971. While serving as speaker, King was responsible for the speeding up of question time and for changing the dress code to allow women MPs to wear trousers in the House of Commons chamber.\n\nAfter leaving the Commons, he entered the House of Lords and was created a life peer as Baron Maybray-King of the City of Southampton on 2 March 1971, and went on to serve as a Deputy Speaker. He took the \"Maybray\" from his own middle name which was his mother Margaret's maiden name. He was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Laws) by the University of Bath in 1969. In 1977 he celebrated the opening of the Itchen Bridge by being driven across it in a horse-dawn Landau.\n\nHe is commemorated by his name having been given to an arched passageway leading to the site of the former primary school, off the High Street in the village of Norton-on-Tees County Durham, in which he lived as a child and in the naming of the A3024 Maybray King Way in Southampton.\n\nHe was an active fraternalist with the Loyal Order of Moose in Great Britain. He was created an honorary Grand Governor in 1972 and served as Grand Governor in 1976-1977.\n\nHe was married four times:\n\nAn unpublished biography/autobiography (\"A Boy Called Horace\") is in the Parliamentary Archives.\n"}

It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1974 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\n\nThe Scarab Club was formed in 1907. It began as an informal association named the Hopkin Club after the founder, marine painter Robert Hopkin. The members met regularly to talk art, eat dinner, and critique paintings. The club's vision since inception was \n\"to promote the mutual acquaintance of art lovers and art workers; to stimulate and guide toward practical expression the artistic sense of the people of Detroit; to advance the knowledge and love of the fine arts in every possible manner; and to maintain a clubhouse for entertainment and social purposes as well as to provide working and exhibit facilities for artist members.\"\nRenamed the \"Scarab Club\" in 1913, the club grew in popularity, and member Lancelot Sukert, a Detroit architect, designed the current clubhouse, which opened its doors on October 5, 1928. The interior of the club is decorated with objets d'art created and contributed by members over the decades. The building showcases exquisite tile sculptures from Pewabic Pottery, including the Scarab Club logo. The ceiling beams of the lounge once served as the club's guest book, and poet Vachel Lindsay signed as one of the first visitors. Since then, signing the beam has become a ceremonial honor, and the autographs of art world luminaries such as John Sloan, Diego Rivera, Pablo Davis, Marcel Duchamp, Norman Rockwell, and John Sinclair grace the beams.\n\nAmerican artist, inventor, and automobile pioneer George Schuyler Hodges, of Pontiac, Michigan, was a charter member of the club.\n\nThe club's themed costumed balls, held from 1917 to 1950, were the single most important social event in Detroit each year. \"Life\" magazine covered the 1937 event with a two-page photo spread, and \"The Detroit News\" and \"The Detroit Free Press\" also gave the annual balls two pages in their photo sections. Radio station WJR broadcast live from the 1937 \"Scarabean Cruise\" ball.\n\nFor many years The Book Club of Detroit held its regular meetings at the Scarab Club.\n\nThe annual Exhibition of Michigan Artists at the Detroit Institute of Arts was originated by the Scarab Club in 1911. In 1915 the Scarab Club Prize became the top award and in 1917 the first Scarab Club Gold Medal was awarded. The gold medal is still the club's most prestigious award, given each December at the Gold Medal Exhibition and Dinner.\n\nThe clubhouse was built in 1928 in the Arts and Crafts style by architect and member Lancelot Sukert. The exterior mosaic tiles, which appeared in 1928 renderings, were not completed until the 1980s, when they were finished by W.P.A. muralist and member Edgar Yaeger, who was a junior member of the club in 1928. The ceramic scarab embedded over the front entrance was designed by sculptor Horace Colby and fired at Pewabic Pottery.\n\nThe original paneled wood entry in the front hints at intrigue inside, while a brick-walled courtyard in the rear of the building conjures up more pastoral images, with its exquisite flower gardens, fountain and statuary. The club contains several galleries and lounges, as well as six working artist studios. The second floor lounge is unique for its massive ceiling beams painted by members in 1928 and signed by more than 230 artists since, including Diego Rivera, Norman Rockwell, Marshall Fredericks and Pablo Davis. Other beams were painted to depict events in the club's history. The lounge also contains a fireplace with mural depicting different levels of club membership, painted by Paul Honoré. Original mica and metal lighting and furnishings complete the decor.\n\n"}

The band disbanded upon the death of founder and frontman Lemmy. He currently tours with his own band Phil Campbell and the Bastard Sons, featuring his three sons; Todd, Dane and Tyla.\n\nCampbell was born in Pontypridd, and started playing guitar when he was 10 years old, inspired by guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix, Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi, Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page, Jan Akkerman, Michael Schenker and Todd Rundgren. At the age of 12, Campbell met Lemmy after a Hawkwind gig and asked him for an autograph. By the age of 13, Campbell was playing semi-professionally with a cabaret band called Contrast. He later played with a pub-rock band called Roktopus (not to be confused with Rocktopus) at gigs in and around South Wales. He bought his first Les Paul in 1978 at a New Year's Day guitar sale at a shop on Ealing Broadway, London. The guitar was later stolen.\n\nIn 1979, Campbell formed the heavy metal band, Persian Risk, playing on their 7\" singles, \"Calling For You\" (1981) and \"Ridin' High\" (1983). Compilation albums have been issued which feature some of his work with Persian Risk.\n\nOn 8 February 1984, following the departure of Brian Robertson, Motörhead held auditions for a new guitarist, narrowing the candidates down to two guitarists: Michael \"Würzel\" Burston and Philip Campbell. Though Lemmy had first planned on hiring only one guitarist, he hired both Würzel and Campbell upon hearing them play together.\n\nOn 14 February 1984, Motörhead were the musical guest for \"The Young Ones\" episode \"Bambi\". One of the band's most popular compilations, \"No Remorse\", followed shortly, it was released on 15 September. Campbell has since toured the world with the band and has remained a constant member of Motörhead, despite a number of changes to their line up over the years.\n\nOn 28 December 2015, band founder and sole constant member Lemmy died. The following day, drummer Mikkey Dee announced that Motörhead had disbanded, stating: \"We will not be doing any more tours or anything. And there will not be any more records. But the fire survives, and Lemmy lives on in the hearts of everyone.\"\n\nIn February 2016, Campbell entered the studio along with Slipknot percussionist Chris Fehn to record a new solo album.\n\nPhil's first solo album \"Old Lions Still Roar\" was released on 25 October 2019 and features guest vocals from Alice Cooper, Rob Halford, Dee Snider and Benji Webbe.\n\nIn November 2016, his new project Phil Campbell and the Bastard Sons released their first recording, a self-titled EP. The band has subsequently performed in supporting slots with Guns & Roses, Hawkwind, Saxon, and Airbourne.\n\nIn August 2017, Phil Campbell and the Bastard Sons announced that they were to start recording their debut album. On 26 October 2017, Phil Campbell and the Bastard Sons announced the title of the debut album as \"The Age of Absurdity\", which was released on 26 January 2018 on Nuclear Blast Records . The album was produced by Romesh Dodangoda.\n\nThe band's line up for the album features Phil and his three sons, together with former Attack! Attack! vocalist from South Wales Neil Starr.\n\nPhil Campbell and the Bastard Sons released a cover of Hawkwind's \"Silver Machine\" on 21 April 2018 for Record Store Day. The track was previously available as a bonus track on some CD versions of \"The Age of Absurdity\".\n\nCampbell resides in Pontypridd, Wales with his wife Gaynor and their three children: Todd, Dane, and Tyla.\n\nCampbell uses an LAG Explorer Signature model guitar both live and in the studio, fitted with two Seymour Duncan humbuckers and a single (volume) control. He also uses DBZ, Charvel, Caparison, a couple of Framus Custom Shop guitars on stage, with an occasional acoustic Dean. He has also been known to play ESP, PRS, Minarik Infernos and a Parker Nitefly guitars.\n\nHe also uses guitars built by luthier TC Ellis. So far, Ellis has built him a Les Paul-styled, a Stratocaster-styled, and one modelled after Lemmy's custom-built Rickenbacker 4004.\n\nLike Lemmy, Phil uses Marshall Amplifiers and Cabinets when playing live, currently using Marshall JVM410H, JVM410H-JS, JCM 900 4100 and 1959RR heads. In the studio he has been known to use Line 6, ENGL, Bogner and . Earlier in his career he occasionally played Gallien-Krueger amplifiers.\n\nHe mainly uses Dunlop pedals (Micro Amp, Micro Chorus, Phase 90 (Script or EVH), Carbon Copy, Smart Gate, Slash Octave Fuzz & 95Q wah), strings (10–46) and picks (.88).\n\n"}

In Brazil, they inhabit Ñande Ru Marangatu, an area of tropical rainforest. This was declared a reservation in October 2004. Marcos Verón, a leader of this people was beaten to death in January 2003.\n\nThey are one of the three Guaraní sub-groups (the others are Ñandeva and Mbya).\n\nThey mainly live in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul. It is estimated that more than 30,000 Guaranis live in Brazil. In Paraguay they number about 40,000. The Guaraní language is one of the official languages of Paraguay, alongside the Spanish language.\n\nThe Guarani-Kaiowá are also known as the Kaiwá, Caingua, Caiua, Caiwa, Cayua, Kaiova, and Kayova. These spellings were largely devised by Europeans, The National Museum of Brazil (Portuguese: Museu Nacional) keeps records of the earliest Latinized forms for transcribing the name on behalf of the people, coincidentally Kaiowá means exactly this 'the people' - in their own language.\n\nThey speak the Kaiwá language, a Tupi-Guarani language, Subgroup I. Literacy is extremely low—from 5% to 10%. Kaiwá is written in the Latin script.\n\nThe Guaraní sub-groups have different ways of social organisation, but they share a religion which sees the land as very important. The god Ñande Ru created the Guarani as the first peoples and the Guarani are deeply spiritual, as there's a prayer house in every village and the cacique, shaman, is of great importance in the community.\n\n\"Terra sem Mal\", which means \"land without evil\" is the land of the dead people in their mythology, and it is important that every soul can go to Terra sem Mal. When invaders occupied Guarani land, the Guarani feel as if their religion is offended, and when they lose their land to intruders they have too little land to sustain their traditional life, based on fishing, hunting, and farming.\n\nMany live in abject poverty in camp sites at the side of busy motorways or in temporary settlements in occupied farmland in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, in Central-West Region, Brazil. They consider this land as their ancestral land.\n\nTheir lifestyles consist on living happily on their own land, growing small crops to support their livelihood. These villages have schools and Government assistance.\n\nDespite the tribe still fights for living in this territory according to their traditions, young generations are starting to getting in contact with new technologies thanks to the work of some NGO’s such as Our Tribe. These NGOs offer workshops to teach young tribe members techniques to document their lifestyles.\n\nThe Guarani-Kaiowá had no contact with the European settlers before the late 1800s. Since the beginning of the 1980s, the Guarani-Kaiowá tribe has been gradually forced to leave their traditional settlements as a consequence of the deforestation to get soy, corn and cane plantations. This eviction process has worsened the Guarani-Kaiowá living conditions. Furthermore, the non-secured and underpaid work on plantations has provoked deaths, even of young children, during decades. The attacks this community has received have their root on the high profitability of the lands they inhabit for the growing of agri-businesses and biofuel industry. For example, the Guarani tribe has denounced for years the permanent threat of expulsion from their lands and the poisoning by farmers of their water resources.\n\nThe conflict of interest between Brazilian authorities and indigenous tribes has increased since the South American country was chosen to harbor the next Football World Cup in 2014. In October 2012, a group of 170 Kaiowás (50 men, 50 women and 70 children) camping for almost a year at the Cambará farm, near the Joguico River in Iguatemi, Mato Grosso do Sul, at the border with Paraguay, after an eviction order had been issued by a federal judge, declared they were ready to accept their extinction. According to a letter sent to the Conselho Indigenista Missionário (Cimi, Missionary Indian Council) and to the national management of Fundação Nacional do Índio (Funai):\n\nThe federal order detailed that in case the indigenous community does not abandon the land, the Fundação Nacional do Índio (Funai) will have to pay 250 dollars per day they still occupy the territory.\n\nParts of the Brazilian press understood the letter as a mass suicide announcement. The Avaaz.org issued a petition against their genocide. The decision was suspended by a court order on October 30, 2012.\n\nIn 2012 the Indian museum in Rio de Janeiro, around which exists a Guarani-Kaiowá settlement, also received an eviction order. This settlement is next to Maracana football stadium, which in requirements of the FIFA, has to be expanded for the inauguration and closure ceremonies of the Football World Cup.\n\nIn October 2012 Rio de Janeiro’s Governor Sergio Cabral said in a press conference that it was necessary to overthrow the old museum. The building was abandoned in 1977 and occupied by indigenous communities since that moment. “It has no historic value and it is going to be demolished because the FIFA and World Cup Organizational Committee demand it” he explained. However, the FIFA clarified through a press note in posterior dates that it never asked for the demolition of the Indian Museum.\n\nIn the Guarani-Kaiowá and other ethnicities response to that decision was clear. The twelve of January 2012 a police unit arrived at the indigenous land without a judicial order to evict the community and the inhabitants were waiting to them at the beginning of the settlement to defend it. \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2261087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2261087", "title": "Sign of the horns", "text": "Sign of the horns\n\nThe sign of the horns is a hand gesture with a variety of meanings and uses in various cultures. It is formed by extending the index and little fingers while holding the middle and ring fingers down with the thumb.\n\nIn Hinduism, the hand gesture is known as the \"Apana yogic mudra\". In Indian classical dance forms the hand gesture symbolises the Lion. In Buddhism it is seen as an apotropaic gesture very commonly used by Gautama Buddha as \"Karana Mudra\" which is synonymous with expulsion of demons and removal of obstacles like sickness or negative thoughts.\n\nThe apotropaic usage of the sign can also be seen in Italy and in other Mediterranean cultures where, when confronted with unfortunate events, or simply when these events are mentioned, the sign of the horns may be given to ward off bad luck. It is also used traditionally to counter or ward off the \"evil eye\" (\"malocchio\" in Italian). In Italy specifically, the gesture is known as the \"corna\". With fingers pointing down, it is a common Mediterranean apotropaic gesture, by which people seek protection in unlucky situations (it is thus a more Mediterranean equivalent of knocking on wood). Thus, for example, the President of the Italian Republic, Giovanni Leone, shocked the country when, while in Naples during an outbreak of cholera, he shook the hands of patients with one hand while with the other behind his back he superstitiously made the \"corna\", presumably to ward off the disease or in reaction to being confronted by such misfortune. This act was well documented by the journalists and photographers who were right behind him, a fact that had escaped President Leone's mind in that moment. \n\nIn Italy and other parts of the Mediterranean region, the gesture must usually be performed with the fingers tilting downward to signify the warding off of bad luck; in the same region and elsewhere, the gesture may take a different, offensive and insulting meaning if it is performed with fingers upward or if directed aggressively towards someone in a swiveling motion (see section below). In Italy, one can also \"touch iron\" (\"tocca ferro\") or touch one's nose to ward off bad luck. Males in Italy may also grab their testicles when confronted by bad luck; however, this is considered more vulgar.\n\nIn Peru one says \"contra\" (against). In the Dominican Republic the expression is \"zafa\", said against curses known as \"fukú\". All of these gestures are meant to conjure supernatural protection.\n\nThe sign of the horns is used during religious rituals in Wicca, to invoke or represent the Horned god.\n\nIn many Mediterranean and Latin countries, such as Brazil, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Mexico when directed towards someone and swiveled back and forth, the sign implies cuckoldry; the common words for \"cuckolded\" in Italian, Greek and Spanish are , () and , respectively, literally meaning \"horned\". During a European Union meeting in February 2002, then-current Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi was photographed performing this gesture behind the back of Josep Piqué, the Spanish foreign minister.\n\nThe 1969 back album cover for \"Witchcraft Destroys Minds & Reaps Souls\" on Mercury Records by Chicago-based psychedelic-occult rock band Coven, led by singer Jinx Dawson, pictured Coven band members giving the \"sign of the horns\". Starting in early 1968, Coven concerts always began and ended with Dawson giving the sign on stage.\n\nOn the cover of the Beatles' \"Yellow Submarine\" album (1969), the cartoon of John Lennon's right hand is making the sign above Paul McCartney's head. Some fans interpreted this as one of the many supposed \"Paul is dead\" clues. Some may think it is possible that the cartoonist misrepresented the sign for \"I love you\", which is very similar and more in keeping with the band's public message and image. However, the 1969 cartoon is based on many photos of John Lennon making the hand sign in 1967. One of these photos of Lennon doing the hand sign appears on the cover of a Beatles single release shortly after, making it the first time the hand sign appears on a rock release.\n\nThe sign is also used in various Disney movies. It can be seen in the medieval-style opening sequence of the 1971 British-American Disney movie \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\" as a goat-legged figure with a jester's cap leading a procession of outlandish looking figures, flashes the sign.\n\nBeginning in the early 1970s, the horns were known as the \"P-Funk sign\" to fans of Parliament-Funkadelic. It was used by George Clinton and Bootsy Collins as the password to the Mothership, a central element in Parliament's science-fiction mythology, and fans used it in return to show their enthusiasm for the band. Collins is depicted showing the P-Funk sign on the cover of his 1977 album \"Ahh... The Name Is Bootsy, Baby!\" \n\nFrank Zappa can be seen jokingly making the gesture in the 1979 film \"Baby Snakes\" in response to the audience, commenting, \"That's right, spindle twice.\"\n\nIn 1977, a painting of Gene Simmons (of the band KISS) exhibits the sign on the cover of \"Love Gun\", the band's sixth studio album. Simmons still utilizes the sign, both on and off stage.\n\nMarlon Brando makes the sign whilst singing \"Luck Be a Lady\" in the 1955 film \"Guys and Dolls\", seeming to indicate it was a sign for snake eyes in the craps game he is playing for the gamblers' souls.\n\nIn the 1985 film, \"The Breakfast Club\", Richard \"Dick\" Vernon is the grumpy vice principal of Shermer High School and the main antagonist of the film. One of his most famous lines is, \" Don't mess with the bull young man, you'll get the horns\", flashing the sign of the horns while rotating his wrist.\n\nIn one episode of the popular animated series The Simpsons, a female tramp is seen warding off a male tramp using the sign of the horns using her thumbs and index fingers, screaming 'And you're a three-headed devil dog! Devil dog!'\n\nFor the 2016 Indian movie \"Rock On 2\", The \"2\" in the title is stylized with the sign of the horns, with the two extended fingers representing \"2\".\n\nRonnie James Dio was known for popularizing the sign of the horns in heavy metal. He claimed his Italian grandmother used it to ward off the evil eye (which is known in Southern Italy as \"malocchio\"). Dio began using the sign soon after joining the metal band Black Sabbath in 1979. The previous singer in the band, Ozzy Osbourne, was rather well known for using the \"peace\" sign at concerts, raising the index and middle finger in the form of a V. Dio, in an attempt to connect with the fans, wanted to similarly use a hand gesture. However, not wanting to copy Osbourne, he chose to use the sign his grandmother always made. The horns became famous in metal concerts very soon after Black Sabbath's first tour with Dio. The sign would later be appropriated by heavy metal fans under the name \"maloik\", a corruption of the original \"malocchio\".\n\nTerry \"Geezer\" Butler of Black Sabbath can be seen \"raising the horns\" in a photograph taken in 1971. The photograph is included in the CD booklet of the \"\" compilation album. This would indicate that there had been some association between the \"horns\" and heavy metal before Dio's popularization of it.\n\nWhen asked if he was the one who introduced the hand gesture to metal subculture, Dio said in a 2001 interview with Metal-Rules.com:\n\nGene Simmons of the rock group KISS attempted to claim the \"devil horns\" hand gesture for his own. According to CBS News, \"Simmons filed an application on Friday, June 16, 2017 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for a trademark on the hand gesture he regularly uses during concerts and public appearances — thumb, index and pinky fingers extended, with the middle and ring fingers folded down. According to Simmons, this hand gesture was first used in commerce — by him — on Nov. 14, 1974. He is claiming the hand gesture should be trademarked for \"entertainment, namely live performances by a musical artist [and] personal appearances by a musical artist.\" Simmons abandoned this application on June 21, 2017.\n\nIn text-based electronic communication, the sign of the horns is represented with the codice_1, codice_2 or codice_3 emoticon and sometimes with codice_4. The Unicode character U+1F918 🤘 SIGN OF THE HORNS was introduced in Unicode 8.0 as an emoji, on June 17, 2015.\n\nThe \"sign of the horns\" hand gesture is used in criminal gang subcultures to indicate membership or affiliation with Mara Salvatrucha. The significance is both the resemblance of an inverted \"devil horns\" to the Latin letter 'M', and in the broader demonic connotation, of fierceness and nonconformity. \nHook 'em Horns is the slogan and hand signal of the University of Texas at Austin. Students and alumni of the university employ a greeting consisting of the phrase \"Hook 'em\" or \"Hook 'em Horns\" and also use the phrase as a parting good-bye or as the closing line in a letter or story. The gesture is meant to approximate the shape of the head and horns of the UT mascot, the Texas Longhorn Bevo.\n\nFans of the University of South Florida Bulls use the same hand sign at their athletic events, except that the hand is turned around and facing the other way. With the middle and ring finger extending towards the person presenting the \"Go Bulls\" sign.\n\nFans of North Dakota State University Bison athletics also use a similar hand gesture, known as \"Go Bison!\" The pinky and index fingers are usually slightly bent, however, to mimic the shape of a bison's horns.\n\nFans of North Carolina State University Wolfpack athletics use a similar gesture with the middle and ring fingers moving up and down over the thumb to mimic a wolf's jaw.\n\nFans of University of California, Irvine Anteaters use a similar sign with the middle and ring fingers out to resemble the head of the mighty anteater.\n\nFans of University of Nevada, Reno Wolf Pack athletics use a similar sign with the middle and ring fingers out to resemble the wolf's snout. \n\nA variation of this hand gesture is also used in the professional wrestling industry, which fans dub the \"Too Sweet\". It was possibly innovated by Scott Hall and the other members of The Kliq, and has since been attributed to other wrestling groups such as the nWo and Bullet Club, as well as individual wrestlers such as Finn Bálor.\n\nFans of University of Utah athletics, particularly football and gymnastics, use a gesture where the index and pinky finger are straight and parallel to each other, forming a block \"U.\"\n\nFans of Northwestern State University Demon athletics also use a similar hand gesture, known as \"Fork 'em!\" The pinky and index fingers are extended but a little more parallel to each other resembling the horns on a demon.\n\nArizona State University Sun Devil fans make a pitchfork sign by extending the index and middle fingers, as well as the pinky. The thumb holds down the ring finger to complete the gesture.\n\nFans of the Wichita State University Shockers frequently hold up their middle finger in addition to the pointer and pinky fingers as a reference to the comic sexual act.\n\nFans of the Grand Canyon University Antelopes use this hand gesture with a slight variation by touching the tips of the ring and middle finger with the thumb to form the shape of an antelope and its horns. Often followed by the phrase \"Lopes up\".\n\nFans of the Universidad de Chile soccer team use this gesture to represent their support for the team by forming a U-shaped hand gesture, often followed by the phrase \"Grande la U\".\n\n\n"}

The late twentieth century organisation is known as the Provisional Irish Republican Army. The political movement in total is dedicated to irredentism through Irish republicanism, the belief that all of Ireland should be an independent republic free from British rule. The original Irish Republican Army formed in 1917 from those Irish Volunteers who did not enlist in the British Army during World War I, members of the Irish Citizen Army and others. Their ranks were reinforced by Irishmen, formerly in the British Army in World War I, who returned to Ireland to fight against Britain in the Irish War of Independence. In Irish law, this IRA was the army of the Irish Republic as declared (unilaterally) by Dáil Éireann in 1919. Some Irish people dispute the claims of more recently created organisations that insist that they are the only legitimate descendants of the original IRA, often referred to as the \"Old IRA\" (in contrast to the Provisional IRA).\n\nThe playwright and former IRA member Brendan Behan once said that the first issue on any Irish organisation's agenda was \"the split\". For the IRA, that has often been the case. The first split came after the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921, with supporters of the Treaty forming the nucleus of the National Army of the newly created Irish Free State, while the anti-treaty forces continued to use the name \"Irish Republican Army\". After the end of the Irish Civil War (1922–23), the IRA was around in one form or another for forty years, when it split into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA in 1969. The latter then had its own breakaways, namely the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA, each claiming to be the true successor of the Army of the Irish Republic.\n\nHere in more detail is a representation of a genealogical tree of Irish nationalist movements derived from the original IRA:\n\n\n For a diagrammatic version of this, see Genealogy of the Irish Republican Army.\n\n"}

{"id": "2261110", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2261110", "title": "Home, Washington", "text": "Home, Washington\n\nHome is a census-designated place in Pierce County, Washington, United States. The 2010 Census placed the population at 1,377. The community lies on the Key Peninsula and borders the waters of Carr Inlet, an extension of Puget Sound. Home is now primarily a town of beach homes, although around the turn of the twentieth century, it was considered a model, utopian community of anarchists.\n\nAfter the failure of the industrial cooperative colony Glennis located east of Eatonville, three former Glennisites — George H. Allen, Oliver A. Verity, and B. F. O'Dell — set out in the summer of 1895 into Puget Sound on a rowboat they built themselves to find an isolated location for a new community. Home was one of about two hundred similar communities that sprung up in America in the late 1800s.\n\nThey decided upon Von Geldern Cove (also known as Joe's Bay) as the site for their new Home Colony, which would be an intentional community based on anarchist philosophy. The founders purchased there at $7 an acre, working odd jobs to pay for it. By 1896, their families had joined them and cabins were constructed.\n\nBy 1898 a land buying corporation was set up called the Mutual Home Association, whose Articles of Incorporation and Agreement stated their purpose as \"to assist its members in obtaining and building homes for themselves and to aid in establishing better social and moral conditions.\" Land was apportioned to those who became members of the Association, agreeing to its anarchist ideals and to pay for their lot. The title to each member's land would stay with the Association; however this was changed in 1909. The Association also held title to a meeting hall, called Liberty Hall, and a trading post.\n\nWhen Home was plotted in 1901 it had increased in size to and had become home to anarchists, communists, food faddists, freethinkers, nudists, and others who did not fit in with mainstream society. Elbert Hubbard, anarchist Emma Goldman, and national communist leader William Z. Foster visited and gave lectures.\n\nSome high-profile anarchists and free thinkers lived, raised families and wrote about the free thinking anarchist movement in Home. Such individuals brought their share of scandal and intrigue to the community. One such figure was Gertie Vose, who once lived in Portland and contributed to \"The Firebrand\" (alongside other notable anarchists like Jay Fox and Emma Goldman)\".\" Her move to the Home colony was thought to be motivated by her son, Donald Vose. He was said to be a shy, lonely kid and Gertie thought a move to the anarchist friendly area would improve his social skills and make him more comfortable with her beliefs. Gertie quickly established her place in this community by contributing to one of Home's newspapers, \"The Discontent\", and by organizing meetings and entertaining visitors. Gertie Vose also became good friends with fellow anarchist and writer, Emma Goldman. They kept in touch for many years and Goldman wrote about her friendship with Gertie and her less amiable relationship with Donald. Donald Vose was a less harmonious addition to the community which contrasted with his mother's flourishing role in the colony. He was described as \"irresponsible, lazy and bumblingly inept at everything he tried.\" Home was showing signs of splintering as people with differing views and ideology began to separate and disperse.\n\nFollowing the assassination of President McKinley by anarchist Leon Czolgosz in 1901, the community came under scrutiny from outsiders, especially newspapers in nearby Tacoma. Inflammatory articles led to threats being made by a vigilante committee called the Loyal League formed by members of the Grand Army of the Republic, who planned to invade the colony by steamboat and \"put it to the torch.\" They were stopped when the steamboat owner refused to take them.\n\nIn 1902, after charges of violation of the Comstock Act resulting from an article advocating free-love published in the local anarchist newspaper \"\", Home's post office was closed by postal inspectors and moved to the smaller town of Lakebay. The people of Home were labeled \"vicious\" by officials, and thus people like the citizens of Tacoma, Washington believed the community was detrimental to moral values.\n\nThe radical feminist Lois Waisbrooker was a resident of Home during a later phase of her controversial career (1901 to 1904), and was involved in the prosecution that led to the closing of the Home post office. Emma Goldman was also a radical ideologue who studied the works of people like Walt Whitman and thus disseminated the idea of \"sexual intermediacy\". Waisbrooker and Goldman and other women like them exeplified feminist ideology that fit into the larger anarchist canon that had developed in 20th century America.\n\nThe Association became divided into disagreeing factions called \"nudes\" and \"prudes.\" The two factions were coined in a series of editorials in the Home newspaper \"The Agitator\" in which editor Jay Fox defended Homeites arrested in 1911 for nude swimming — and nude swimming in general — against those in Home who had reported them to county authorities. This division between conservative and more liberal factions of the colony contributed greatly to the colony's decline in 1919. Because of these editorials, Fox was charged with the misdemeanor of encouraging or advocating disrespect for law or for any court or courts of justice and jailed for two months. Not only was the colony fracturing from within but public opinion outside of Home was less than favorable. Many people saw the disagreement totally arbitrary seeing as it was discussing people being nude in public and that was socially unacceptable outside of the community. \"The Agitator\" ran stories that dealt with things like the Hay Market riot in Chicago and other instances of injustice against the anarchist movement. When Jay Fox moved from Home, WA to Chicago he took his paper with him and renamed it \"The Syndicalist.\"\n\nThe debate over Home's clothing-optional policies was a common theme in communities like this across the country. In most cases the free-love lifestyle that anarchists strived for came into conflict with the strict cultural norms of the mainstream. These communities \"withered as a result of public hostility as well as internal disagreement over ideology and practice.\"\n\nAs people in the colony became more divided on their views of anarchism the colony began to fracture. The \"nudes and prudes\" debate made it clear that the colony was not living in a totally cohesive utopia, but rather a complicated collection of similar people who could not fully reconcile their differing interpretations of anarchism. In 1919 the Association was dissolved and the anarchist community, as it was, dissolved as well. The July 27, 1919, \"Omaha Daily Bee\" reported the event as \"Free Love Colony Dissolved by Court.\"\n\n"}

The Philadelphia Marathon ranks among the top ten in the nations largest marathons with over 30,000 runners, 60,000 spectators and 3,000 volunteers. The 30,000 runners come from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and over 42 countries. The marathon course is professionally certified at , and is sanctioned by the USA Track & Field and RRTC. Leo Dignam is the current executive director of the Philadelphia Marathon.\n\nThe roots of the AACR Philadelphia Marathon (aka the Philadelphia Independence Marathon) can be traced back to 1954, the race’s unofficial inaugural year. The marathon then largely was a suburban event and went by many different names; the Greater Philadelphia Independence Marathon (1981–82) and the Fairmount Park Marathon (1988–89). The marathon today, was established under the name of the Philadelphia Marathon in 1994 under then Mayor Ed Rendell as an annual running event that took place entirely within the City of Philadelphia.\n\nThis yearly event takes place on the 3rd Sunday in November or “the Sunday before Thanksgiving”. The Marathon is a top U.S. running event and top Boston qualifier with 30,000 runners participating in one or more of 5 featured events. During Marathon Weekend over 60,000 spectators and over 3,000 volunteers provide valuable race day support. Working along with volunteers from local schools, colleges and universities and the community actively participate to organize cheer zones, manage replenishment stations, monitor the course and provide support to help runners have their best possible runner experience while in the “City of Brotherly Love and Sisterly Affection”.\n\nAs a major City event, the Marathon was produced by the Office of the City Representative. In 1995,a group of dedicated runners and Dr. Peter Sharkey of the Rothman Institute, a top Philadelphia orthopedic practice, sponsored a smaller running event as part of the Sunday Marathon event. Now, 23 years and 3,000 runners later, the Rothman 8K is an integral part of Marathon Weekend and an enjoyable event for beginners or those who just want to run. It is also for some, a warm-up for the longer distances. In 2006, a half marathon was added to the Sunday line up by Janis Pierce, the City Representative at that time, and a runner.\n\nIn 2011, two competitors died, which were the first deaths to occur in the Philadelphia Marathon in over a decade. The first was Jeffrey Lee, a 21-year-old Nursing and Wharton student attending the University of Pennsylvania. Having collasped after crossing the finish line of an apparent heart attack, the cause of his death actually remains unknown. Although the cause of death was officially diagnosed as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, after further examination of the autopsy, it was concluded that the diagnosis may not have been accurate since the size of his heart would have been normal for an athlete. Therefore, medical professionals believe his death may have been caused by an underlying heart condition, not a heart attack. \nThe second death was of Chris Gleason, a 40-year-old experienced triathlete from Clifton Park, NY. Gleason collapsed a quarter-mile from the finish line from heart attack. \n\nIn 2013, Gore-Tex was announced to be the title sponsor for the next three years.\n\nIn 2017, American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) was announced to be the title sponsor for the next three years for the full marathon.\n\nIn 2017, Dietz & Watson was announced to be the official sponsor for the half marathon.\n\nIn 2017, the Rothman Institute agreed to continue its sponsorship of the 8K event. The Rothman Institute has been part of the Philadelphia Marathon for over 19 years, dating back to when Drs. Richard Rothman and Peter Sharkey began sponsoring the 8K as part of their community outreach efforts.\n\nIn 2017, Dunkin' Donuts was announced to be the official sponsor for the Dunkin' Munchkins Run.\n\nIn 2018, Garmin joined the team of sponsors for the Marathon, and was named the official timer and running watch for that year's marathon. \n\nThe course begins and ends at the Philadelphia Museum of Art on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. The Philadelphia Marathon course is relatively flat and offers a view of many historical landmarks that include Independence Hall, the Betsy Ross House and the Liberty Bell. The course travels the streets of Old City on Penn’s Landing, parallel to the Delaware River, along the Schuylkill River and out to Manayunk. The highest elevation in the course is approximately 148 feet. The terrain presents many uphill and downhill challenges for the runners, though the course itself is very flat compared to other large scale marathons.\n\nThe event also serves as a qualifying race for entry into the Boston Marathon for participants whose times meet age group bracketed standards. The race also features a state of the art timing system, using a small chip that attached to the back of each runner's bib that provides a 'chip time' for when the person has crossed the start and finish lines, as well as giving a traditional 'gun time'.\n\nHealth and Fitness Expo - Runners pick up their race packets that include a race bib, timing tag, T-shirt and bag at the free two-day health and fitness expo located in the Pennsylvania Convention Center.\n\nCheer Zones – Spectators can select from more than 20 cheer zones throughout the course to show support to the runners.\n\nTransportation - Detours throughout parts of the city begin at 3AM and run until 1PM \n\nSeveral cash prizes are awarded for the full marathon.\n\nAll marathon runners receive a Philadelphia Marathon T-shirt, a Finisher Medal and a finisher certificate (available online after the race).\n\nThe Half Marathon was added to Race Weekend in 2006 and winds through Philadelphia’s most scenic and historic neighborhoods. From the history-steeped streets of Old City, through one of the liveliest stretches of Center City, across the Schuylkill, up through the bucolic trails of Fairmount Park, and back down to canvas the banks of the river. The course is also sanctioned by USA Track & Field. Dietz and Watson is the current sponsor for the half-marathon portion of the Philadelphia Marathon weekend. Each runner receives a t-shirt, a finisher medal and a finisher certificate (available online after the race).\n\nThe Rothman Institute sponsors an 8-km (about 5 miles) companion race to the Philadelphia Marathon. This race follows a shorter loop of the marathon, starting off on the expansive Benjamin Franklin Parkway before taking a turn on the scenic banks of the Schuylkill River and Martin Luther King Drive. Each runner receives a T-shirt, a finisher medal and a finisher certificate (available online after the race).\n\nThe Philadelphia Marathon, who collaborated with Green Mountain Energy partnered with the Mayor’s Office of Sustainability and the Mayor’s Office of Civic Engagement to turn the race into an eco-friendly sporting event.\n\nIn 2007, the Marathon’s eco-friendly events began with recycling paper, cardboard, plastics, food and medals. Each year the “going green” efforts continued. Pallets were recycled, the Marathon partnered with the More Foundation by recycling sneakers to support families in Ghana, partnered with the Streets Department and began composting cups and organics and introduced the “Waste Watchers Volunteers” to facilitate on-site sorting. In 2012-2013, the Philadelphia Marathon received a Gold Certification from the Council of responsible Sport (ReSport) and organization that certifies special events for environmental sustainability and community engagement. In 2014-15 the Marathon received Green Certification along with achieving Zero Waste (over 90% diversion waste from landfill).\n\nSome of the sustainable initiatives include:\n\n\nWinners by Country\n\nWinners by Continent\n\n\n"}

Vance attended Enid schools from first grade through high school. His father, Leon Robert Vance Sr., was a junior high school principal and also a civil aviation flight instructor, while his uncle had been an aviator in the Army Air Service who had been killed in France during World War I.\n\nVance was considered an above-average student and a great athlete. His father, as principal, thought of education as having great importance, and this spurred Vance Jr. to challenge himself by taking difficult courses in high school. He averaged a 94 percent in mathematics.\n\nVance attended the University of Oklahoma for two years, becoming a member of Phi Delta Theta. After his sophomore year, Vance entered the United States Military Academy on July 1, 1935, as a member of the Class of 1939.\nA 1999 article in \"U.S. News and World Report\" called Vance and his West Point classmates the \"Warrior Class\" because they were destined to fight in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. In his First Class (senior) year, Vance was selected as a cadet sergeant in Company A of the Corps of Cadets. He graduated June 12, 1939, ranked 318th in order of general merit in a class of 456, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant of Infantry.\n\nWhile training at Mitchel Field on Long Island, Vance met Garden City resident, Georgette Drury Brown. They married the day after his graduation from West Point and had a daughter, Sharon, born in 1942. Vance would later name his assigned aircraft \"The Sharon D.\" after his daughter.\n\nVance requested pilot training and completed Basic School at the Spartan School of Aeronautics in Tulsa. On September 13, 1939, he was assigned to Randolph Field, Texas for Primary flight training, graduating the following March, and then to nearby Kelly Field for Advanced Flight School, where he graduated with Class 40C, earning his wings on June 21, 1940. Vance was also recommissioned as a first lieutenant, Air Corps. He served as an instructor until February 1941, when he was transferred to Goodfellow Army Air Field in San Angelo, Texas, and assigned to command the 49th School Squadron. He was at Goodfellow when the United States entered World War II in December 1941, was promoted to captain on April 6 and major on July 17, and remained in command of his basic flight training squadron until reassigned to Strother AAF, Kansas, in December 1942 as Director of Flying. While at Goodfellow, Horace Carswell and Jack Mathis (then an enlisted clerk), both of whom would subsequently receive the Medal of Honor posthumously, served in Vance's squadron. Vance was promoted to lieutenant colonel in September 1943, after little more than four years' service.\nAfter transition training to the Consolidated B-24 Liberator, Vance was assigned in December 1943 to the 489th Bombardment Group at Wendover AAF, Utah, as Deputy Group Commander. The group completed its training and prepared for overseas movement in April 1944, one of the last heavy bombardment groups to be assigned to the Eighth Air Force. The group was assigned to the 95th Combat Bombardment Wing of the 2nd Bomb Division and based at RAF Halesworth. Vance led the group on its first combat mission, bombing the Luftwaffe airfield at Oldenburg, Germany, on May 30, 1944.\n\nOn June 5, 1944, Vance was assigned to lead the 489th BG on a diversionary attack against German coastal defenses near Wimereaux, France, in the Pas-de-Calais, to support the anticipated D-Day landings. The group had lost six bombers on a mission to bomb Brétigny Airfield near Paris on June 2 (Vance did not participate), partly as a consequence of attempting to bomb visually in poor weather conditions. As a result, the lead aircraft of the 489th's formation on June 5 was a Pathfinder Force (PFF) \"Mickey\" B-24 detached from the 44th Bomb Group's 66th Bomb Squadron to enable the group to bomb through overcast using \"blind bombing\" tactics. Vance positioned himself on the bomber's flight deck, standing behind the aircraft commander and co-pilot.\n\nAfter an 0900 takeoff, the group assembled its formation and climbed to its assigned altitude for the short flight to the French coast. The group approached the target area from the south but the bombs of the lead aircraft failed to release, and as a result none of the group bombed. Vance decided to make a second pass over the target rather than jettison the bombs into the English Channel, but as the formation approached the target a second time, it came under intense anti-aircraft fire (\"flak\"). The lead B-24 immediately sustained heavy battle damage. It continued the bomb run, however, and toggled its ordnance, but was further damaged by multiple flak bursts. In all, four crewmen were wounded, three of the four engines were disabled, and fuel lines ruptured in the fuselage. In addition, one of the aircraft's bombs again failed to release. Immediately after bomb release, shrapnel from a final burst killed the aircraft commander and wounded Vance, nearly severing his right foot, which became wedged in cockpit framework behind the copilot's seat. In the chaos that followed, comments on the interphone led Vance to believe that the crew's radio operator, wounded in the legs, was too seriously injured to be evacuated.\n\nThe B-24 lost altitude rapidly after the pilot was killed, but the wounded copilot regained controlled flight, preventing a stall by putting it into a steep glide to maintain airspeed. Despite shock from his own wound, Vance was able to assist the copilot in \"feathering\" the propellers, shutting down the over-strained fourth engine, and optimizing the glide of the crippled aircraft. The crew's \"Mickey\" operator, 2nd Lt. Bernard W. Bail, tried to dislodge Vance's pinned foot and applied a makeshift tourniquet.\n\nWhen the B-24 reached the English coast, it was too damaged to land safely. Vance ordered the crew to \"bail out,\" and after most had complied, took the controls and turned the aircraft back over the channel, where the remainder parachuted into the sea. He decided to attempt a water landing in the belief that the injured radio operator was still on the aircraft, even though B-24s were notoriously ill-suited for \"ditching.\" From a semi-prone position over the power plant controls island between the crew seats, Vance flew the bomber mainly by use of ailerons and elevators, keeping a visual reference through the side window of the cockpit. Although the Liberator survived the ditching largely intact, its dorsal gun turret collapsed and pinned Vance inside the flooded cockpit as the bomber sank. An explosion blew him clear of the wreckage, however, and he was eventually able to inflate his Mae West. After searching for the radio operator, Vance swam towards shore. He was finally picked up by an RAF Air-Sea Rescue launch after fifty minutes.\n\nNearly two months later, after receiving medical treatment in the United Kingdom, Vance was sent back to the United States on a C-54 Skymaster transport for further treatment and possible fitting of a prosthetic foot. The C-54 with all aboard disappeared on July 26, 1944, and was presumed to have crashed into the Atlantic Ocean between Iceland and The recommendation that he be awarded the Medal of Honor was confirmed in orders on January 4, 1945, but his widow requested that the awards ceremony be delayed until the medal could be presented to their daughter. On October 11, 1946, Major General James P. Hodges, commander of the 2nd Bomb Division when Vance was assigned to it, made the presentation to Sharon Vance, age 3½, at Enid Army Air Base.\n\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty on 5 June 1944, when he led a Heavy Bombardment Group, in an attack against defended enemy coastal positions in the vicinity of Wimereaux, France. Approaching the target, his aircraft was hit repeatedly by antiaircraft fire which seriously crippled the ship, killed the pilot, and wounded several members of the crew, including Lt. Col. Vance, whose right foot was practically severed. In spite of his injury, and with 3 engines lost to the flak, he led his formation over the target, bombing it successfully. After applying a tourniquet to his leg with the aid of the radar operator, Lt. Col. Vance, realizing that the ship was approaching a stall altitude with the 1 remaining engine failing, struggled to a semi-upright position beside the copilot and took over control of the ship. Cutting the power and feathering the last engine he put the aircraft in glide sufficiently steep to maintain his airspeed. Gradually losing altitude, he at last reached the English coast, whereupon he ordered all members of the crew to bail out as he knew they would all safely make land. But he received a message over the interphone system which led him to believe 1 of the crewmembers was unable to jump due to injuries; so he made the decision to ditch the ship in the channel, thereby giving this man a chance for life. To add further to the danger of ditching the ship in his crippled condition, there was a 500-pound bomb hung up in the bomb bay. Unable to climb into the seat vacated by the copilot, since his foot, hanging on to his leg by a few tendons, had become lodged behind the copilot's seat, he nevertheless made a successful ditching while lying on the floor using only aileron and elevators for control and the side window of the cockpit for visual reference. On coming to rest in the water the aircraft commenced to sink rapidly with Lt. Col. Vance pinned in the cockpit by the upper turret which had crashed in during the landing. As it was settling beneath the waves an explosion occurred which threw Lt. Col. Vance clear of the wreckage. After clinging to a piece of floating wreckage until he could muster enough strength to inflate his life vest he began searching for the crewmember whom he believed to be aboard. Failing to find anyone he began swimming and was found approximately 50 minutes later by an Air-Sea Rescue craft. By his extraordinary flying skill and gallant leadership, despite his grave injury, Lt. Col. Vance led his formation to a successful bombing of the assigned target and returned the crew to a point where they could bail out with safety. His gallant and valorous decision to ditch the aircraft in order to give the crewmember he believed to be aboard a chance for life exemplifies the highest traditions of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\nThe airbase in his hometown of Enid, Oklahoma, was renamed Vance Air Force Base in his honor on July 9, 1949. He was further honored when Gate 40 of Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, was renamed \"Vance Gate\" on May 9, 1997.\n\n\n"}

In the days before Christmas of 2000, a group of transients in Portland established a tent city. It evolved from a group of self-described \"outsiders\" squatting a city owned land to a self-regulating, city-recognized campground as defined by Portland city code. The encampment is located on a land near Portland International Airport, and has elected community officials and constructed crude but functional cooking, social, electric, and sanitary facilities.\n\nDignity village was founded by eight transients that pitched five tents on a public land. The squatters then picked up significant media coverage and popular support. It was established in the Sunderland neighborhood near the Portland Airport. The group agreed to pay $2,000 in monthly rent, $17,500 per year for toilets and over $5,000 per year for garbage services.\n\nRepeated attempts to shut down the campsite were rebuffed by the Portland City Council. It then guaranteed the community's existence through at least 2010. In March 2019, a tiny house exploded at the encampment from its occupant using a leaking propane tank inside the structure. The 8' x 10' structure was destroyed, according to firefighters. A male living in it was injured. \n\nDignity Village is incorporated in Oregon as a 501(c)(3) membership-based non-profit organization, and is governed by bylaws and a board of directors with an elected chairman and other corporate officers.\n\nMembership is by application review. Dignity Village states that membership is not limited \"based on religion, race, sex, sexual orientation, handicap, age, lifestyle choice, previous (criminal) record or economic status.\"\n\nBecause past criminal convictions are not a negative criterion for membership, and because of dangers presented by continuing construction, children are not allowed to reside in the community.\n\nContinued membership is dependent upon following the community's rules of behavior, contained in their membership agreement:\n\n\nMembership size varies and is limited by the physical size of the available space at the city yard site. As of January 28, 2016, approximately 60 residents made their home at Dignity Village.\n\nDesignated by the Portland City Council as a transitional housing campground, Dignity Village falls under specific State of Oregon building codes governing campgrounds. This provides a legal zoning status. Lack of building codes has shut down many other shanty town/tent cities in the past. Housing in the Dignity Village community previously consisted of tents, hogans, teepees, light wooden shacks, or more substantial structures built using principles of ecofriendly green construction such as strawbale walls and recycled wood. Light clay straw housing was also built in 2003 as part of the City Repair Project's Village Building Convergence.\n\nAmong the services offered by Dignity Village for their residents include:\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the Otis family.\n\nOne of the wealthiest men of Boston during his time, Otis was reportedly worth at least US$800,000 in 1846, which in 2019 would be equivalent to $27 million.\n\nOtis was born in Boston, Massachusetts on October 8, 1765 to Elizabeth (née Gray) and Samuel Allyne Otis. His uncle was Revolutionary War leader James Otis, and his father was active in early American politics as a member of Massachusetts state house of representatives, delegate to Massachusetts state constitutional convention, and Continental Congress delegate from Massachusetts. His aunt was Mercy Otis Warren, a well-known poet.\n\nOtis himself graduated from Boston Latin School in 1773 and Harvard University in 1783, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1786 when he commenced practice in Boston.\n\nIn 1794 he was elected to the Massachusetts legislature, and in 1796 was appointed by President George Washington to be U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts. In 1797, he was elected U.S. Representative from Massachusetts as a Federalist and a strong advocate for centralized government, in which office he served until 1801. He was appointed United States U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts by President John Adams (1801–1802), and again served in the state legislature from 1802 to 1817, serving several terms as President of the state senate (1805–1806, 1808–1811). He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1804. In subsequent years, Otis was elected U.S. Senator from Massachusetts (1817–1822), and then Mayor of Boston (1829–1831).\n\nIn 1814, in the midst of his political career, he was also named a judge of the court of common pleas (1814–1818), and played a leading role as delegate to the controversial Hartford Convention in which New England's secession from the United States was discussed. Overall, it led to the demise of the Federalists, and Otis's political ambitions suffered. Otis subsequently defended the convention in his \"Letters Developing the Character and Views of the Hartford Convention\" (1820) and his \"Letters in Defence of the Hartford Convention\" (1824).\n\nOtis was involved in a major financial scandal during the site selection for the Massachusetts State House. Boston was determined to remain the state capitol, and appointed Otis to a town committee to purchase land and donate it to the state. He did so, and also quietly arranged his own private purchase of adjoining from the agent of John Singleton Copley, then living in England. After a decade of legal arguments, the sale was upheld, and Otis and the Mount Vernon Proprietors developed a large part of Beacon Hill.\n\nOtis was an overseer of Harvard University from 1810 to 1823, and a fellow of the university from 1823 to 1825, as well as one of the original incorporators of the Boston Bank. In 1812, Otis also became a founding member of the American Antiquarian Society.\n\nOn May 31, 1790, Otis married Sally Foster, the daughter of prominent merchant William Foster. During the course of his lifetime, he built not one, but three, grand houses in quick succession (see Harrison Gray Otis House), all designed by noted architect Charles Bulfinch. Together, Harrison and Sally were the parents of eleven children, including:\n\n\nHe died in Boston on October 28, 1848, and is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nThrough his son William, he was the grandfather of Emily Marshall Otis (1832–1906), who married historian and educator Samuel Eliot. Through his son James, he was the grandfather of James Otis, a New York State Senator and society leader.\n\nA descendant was J. Wadsworth Ritchie (1861–1924), son of Montgomery Harrison Ritchie, who died in the American Civil War, and the first husband of Cornelia Wadsworth Ritchie Adair.\n\n"}

{"id": "2261221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2261221", "title": "Christmas decoration", "text": "Christmas decoration\n\nA Christmas decoration is any of several types of ornamentation used at Christmastime and the greater holiday season. The traditional colors of Christmas are pine green (evergreen), snow white, and heart red. Blue, pink, and white are often used to represent winter, or sometimes Hanukkah, which occurs around the same time. Gold and silver are also very common, as are other metallic colours. Typical images on Christmas decorations include Baby Jesus, Father Christmas, Santa Claus, and the star of Bethlehem. \n\nIn many countries, such as Sweden, people start to set up their Advent and Christmas decorations on the first day of Advent. Liturgically, this is done in some parishes through a Hanging of the Greens ceremony. In the Western Christian world, the two traditional days when Christmas decorations are removed are Twelfth Night and if they are not taken down on that day, Candlemas, the latter of which ends the Christmas-Epiphany season in some denominations. Taking down Christmas decorations before Twelfth Night, as well as leaving the decorations up beyond Candlemas, is historically considered to be inauspicious.\n\nThe Christmas tree was first used by German Lutherans in the 16th century, with records indicating that a Christmas tree was placed in the Cathedral of Strassburg in 1539, under the leadership of the Protestant Reformer, Martin Bucer. In the United States, these \"German Lutherans brought the decorated Christmas tree with them; the Moravians put lighted candles on those trees.\" When decorating the Christmas tree, many individuals place a star at the top of the tree symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem, a fact recorded by \"The School Journal\" in 1897. Professor David Albert Jones of Oxford University writes that in the 19th century, it became popular for people to also use an angel to top the Christmas tree in order to symbolize the angels mentioned in the accounts of the Nativity of Jesus. In discussions of folkore, some claim that the Christmas tree is a Christianization of pagan tradition and ritual surrounding the winter solstice, which included the use of evergreen boughs, and an adaptation of pagan tree worship; according to eighth-century biographer Æddi Stephanus, Saint Boniface (634–709), who was a missionary in Germany, took an axe to an oak tree dedicated to Thor and pointed out a fir tree, which he stated was a more fitting object of reverence because it pointed to heaven and it had a triangular shape, which he said was symbolic of the Trinity. However, the English-language phrase \"Christmas tree\" is first recorded in 1835 and represents an importation from the German language. From Germany the custom was introduced to England, first via Queen Charlotte, wife of George III, and then more successfully by Prince Albert during the early reign of Queen Victoria. The influential 1840s image of the Queen's decorated evergreen was republished in the U.S, and as the first widely circulated picture of a decorated Christmas tree in America, the custom there spread. Christmas trees may be decorated with lights and ornaments.\n\nFigural glass Christmas ornaments originated in the small town of Lauscha, Germany in the latter half of the 19th century. The town had long produced fine glassware. The production of Christmas ornaments became a family affair for many people. Some families invested 16 hours a day in production. For some, it was their sole source of income.\n\nSometimes competitions were held. Prizes were awarded to the family producing the finest examples. Santa Clauses, angels, birds, animals, and other traditional Yuletide subjects were favorites.\n\nF.W. Woolworth discovered these glass ornaments on a toy and doll buying trip to Sonnenburg, Germany in the 1890s. He sold them in his \"five and ten cent\" stores in America. The ornaments were said to have contributed to Woolworth's great business success.\n\nFor the American market, figures were blown depicting comic book characters as well as patriotic subjects such as Uncle Sams, eagles, and flags. Glassblowers have held on to the old molds. Glass ornaments are still created from these old molds.\n\nA clear glass tube is heated over an open flame. It is then inserted into a mold. The glassblower then blows into the end of the tube. The glass expands to fill the mold. The glass takes on the shape of the mold. It is cooled. A silver nitrate solution is swirled about inside the ornament. This gives the ornament a silver glow. The outside of the ornament is painted or decorated with metal trims, paper clippings, etc.\n\nCotton batting Christmas ornaments were popular during the years of the German Christmas toy and decoration boom at the turn of the century. They were exported in large numbers to the United States. These decorations suggested puffs of snow. Fruits and vegetables were popular subjects and often had a realistic appearance. African American and patriotic characters were fashioned for the American market. Some ornaments were used to hide boxes of candy.\n\nAssembling these decorations was a cottage industry. Cotton batting was wound around a wire frame resembling a human or animal. A face was either painted on or a lithograph cut-out was affixed to the batting. Figures were given crepe paper costumes. Some were touched with glue and sprinkled with flakes of mica for a glittering appearance.\n\nDresdens are three-dimensional ornaments. They are made of paper, card, or cardboard. Dresdens were produced mostly in Dresden and Leipzig, Germany, from the 1860s to WWI. They were originally priced between 1 and 60 cents. Subjects included animals and birds, suns and moons, humans, carriages and ships, etc. Some Dresdens were flat, allowing the buyer to collect them in scrapbooks.\n\nPositive and negative molds were set into a press. A moistened sheet of card was put into the press. The images were pressed. When they had dried, they were sent to cottage workers for the finishing touches. This involved separating the form-halves from the card, trimming ragged edges, and gluing the two halves together. The form was then gilded, silvered, or hand-painted. Sometimes a small gift or sweet was put into the form. Forms were usually no larger than five inches.\n\n Popular Christmas plants include holly, mistletoe, ivy and Christmas trees. The interior of a home may be decorated with these plants, along with garlands and evergreen foliage. These often come with small ornaments tied to the delicate branches, and sometimes with a small light set.\n\nWreaths are made from real or artificial conifer branches, or sometimes other broadleaf evergreens or holly. Several types of evergreen or even deciduous branches may be used in the same wreath, along with pinecones and sprays of berries, and Christmas ornaments including jingle bells. A bow is usually used at the top or bottom, and an electric or unlit candle may be placed in the middle. Christmas lights are often used, and they may be hung from door or windows, and sometimes walls, lampposts and light fixtures, or even statuary.\nSince the nineteenth century, the poinsettia, a native plant from Mexico, has been associated with Christmas.\n\nIn North and South America, Australia, and Europe, it is traditional to decorate the outside of houses with lights and sometimes with illuminated sleighs, snowmen, and other Christmas figures. Municipalities often sponsor decorations as well. Christmas banners may be hung from street lights and Christmas trees placed in the town square.\n\nIn the Western world, rolls of brightly colored paper with secular or religious Christmas/winter/Hanukkah motifs are manufactured for the purpose of giftwrapping presents. The display of Christmas villages has also become a tradition in many homes during this season. Other traditional decorations include bells, reindeer, candles, candy canes, garland, stockings, wreaths, snow globes, and angels. Snow sheets are made specifically for simulating snow under a tree or village.\n\nIn many countries a representation of the Nativity scene is very popular, and people are encouraged to compete and create the most original or realistic ones. Within some families, the pieces used to make the representation are considered a valuable family heirloom. Some churches also perform a live Nativity with volunteers and even live animals.\n\nOne of the most popular items of Christmas decorations are stockings. According to legend, Saint Nicolas would creep in through the chimney and slip gold into stockings hanging by the fireplace. Various forms of stockings are available; from simple velvet ones, to sock-shaped bags to animated ones.\n\nChristmas decorations are typically put up in late November or early December, usually to coincide with the start of Advent. In the UK, Christmas lights on the high street are generally switched on in November. In the US, the traditional start of Christmas time is Thanksgiving. Major retailers put their seasonal decorations out for sale after back to school sales, while smaller niche Christmas Stores sell Christmas decorations year round.\nIn some places Christmas decorations are traditionally taken down on Twelfth Night, the evening of January 5 or January 6. The difference in this date is due to the fact that some count Christmas Day as the first day of Christmas, whereas for others Christmas Day is a feast day in its own right, and the first full day of the Christmas Season is December 26. In Hispanic and other cultures, this is more like Christmas Eve, as the Three Wise Men bring gifts that night, and therefore decorations are left up longer. The same is true in Eastern Churches which often observe Christmas according to the Julian Calendar, thus making it fall 13 days later.\n\nIn England, it was customary to burn the decorations in the hearth, however this tradition has fallen out of favour as reusable and imperishable decorations made of plastics, wood, glass and metal became more popular. If a Yule Log has been kept alight since Christmas Day, it is put out and the ashes kept to include in the fire on the following Christmas Day. A superstition exists which suggests that if decorations are kept up after Twelfth Night, they must be kept up until the following Twelfth Night, but also that if the decorations for the current Christmas are taken down before the New Year begins, bad luck shall befall the house for a whole year.\n\nIn the United States, most stores immediately remove decorations the day after Christmas, as if the holiday season were over once the gifts are bought. Nearly all Americans leave their home decorations up and lit until at least New Year's Day, and inside decorations can often be seen in windows for several days afterward.\n"}
{"id": "2261237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2261237", "title": "Serú Girán", "text": "Serú Girán\n\nSerú Girán was an Argentine rock supergroup. Formed in 1978, the group consisted of Charly García (keyboards, synthesizers and vocals), David Lebón (guitars and vocals), Pedro Aznar (electric and fretless bass and vocals) and Oscar Moro (drums and percussion). It is considered one of the best in the history of Rock en español, both musically and conceptually, including the staging. It is also renowned for the virtuosity of its musicians.\n\nSerú Girán was born after the separation of the band La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros which Charly García had organized in his early post-Sui Generis. Along with David Lebón, Charly García traveled to Búzios (Brazil) in 1978, with the idea of writing songs for a new album. On their return to Buenos Aires, García met the young and talented bass player Pedro Aznar. They were then joined by Oscar Moro, who was the drummer of La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros and formerly of the legendary group Los Gatos.\n\nThe band Billy Bond and the Jets was formed by Charly García, Billy Bond, David Lebón, Pedro Aznar and Oscar Moro. They released a single disc with tracks like \"Discoshock\", \"Toda la Gente\" (\"All the people\"), and \"Loco, ¿No te sobra una moneda?\" (\"Man, Don't you spare a coin?\"). Finally Billy Bond dismantled the project, and the rest of its members formed Serú Girán.\n\nThe beginnings of the band were difficult. Its first album, \"Serú Girán\" (released in 1978), did not have a good reception even though some of its songs (notably \"Seminare\" and \"Eiti Leda\") would become public anthems. The first public appearance of the band was in a boat over the Riachuelo. What inspired García to do this was the revolutionary band \"Los Jóvenes de Ayer\". In its debut, the band was joined by the orchestral collaborations of Daniel Goldberg, who recorded with 24 musicians in United States.\n\nThe official presentation of the debut album \"Serú Girán\" was held in Estadio Obras Sanitarias on November 3, 1978 with an orchestra of 24 musicians (string section and wind) and closed circuit television. In the back of the stage, a giant screen showing addressing the musicians on stage. Lebón, Aznar and Moro were dressed in white, while Charly chose a jacket, a black mesh bag and snickers. The beginning of the recital, with the full orchestra playing the powerful intro of the song \"Serú Girán\", presaged an unforgettable night. However, it did not go well. The audience didn't get the satire behind the song \"Discoshock\", which is about the disco music in vogue at the time, and was taken aback. Amid a chorus of whistles, the crowd asked the musicians to play \"Blues del levante\", a song written by García at the end of his Sui Generis tenure. The rest of the concert went to general indifference.\n\nSerú Girán released \"La Grasa de las Capitales\" a year later in 1979. The word \"grasa\" means \"grease\" in Spanish, but in Argentina it is also slang for vulgarity. As such, the title of the album was a criticism of the Argentine society in the 1980s. \"Viernes 3 A.M.\" (Friday 3 A.M,) and \"Noche de Perros\" (\"Dog's night\") are the highest peaks of Serú Girán's second release. \"Viernes 3 AM\" would be banned from the radios for a time by the dictatorship because it was considered to incite suicide. This album catapulted Serú Girán as one of the most popular bands of Argentina of that time.\n\nThe official release of \"La Grasa de las Capitales\" held in great number of functions in September and October 1979 in Buenos Aires Auditorium (Ex - Kraft).\n\nIn 1980, the album \"Bicicleta\" (\"Bicycle\") was released. The album described with delicate and admirable accuracy the Argentine social and political times under the dictatorship. \"Canción de Alicia en el país\" (\"Song of Alice in the country\") and \"Encuentro con el diablo\" (\"Encounter with the devil\") are the songs that best described that social reality. To avoid censorship, \"Canción de Alicia en el país\" painted Argentina's reality using metaphors inspired on the book \"Alice in Wonderland\". Charly García described the feelings of early and middle adults in the songs \"A los jóvenes de ayer\" (\"To the youth of yesterday\") and \"Mientras miro las nuevas olas\" (\"While I watch the new waves\").\n\n\"Bicicleta\"   which was also the initial name proposed by Charly for the band but was rejected by the rest of the group   was officially launched at the Estadio Obras Sanitarias stadium on June 6 and 7, 1980. For the concerts, the stage was adorned with wheels of bicycles, rabbits and flowers. The scenery made an impact on the attendants and on the media, being Serú Girán the first group that put some thought about the staging. Serú Girán had delegated scenic responsibility to choreographer Renata Schussheim, who was an old friend of Charly. \"Bicicleta\" marked the beginning of Serú Girán's great shows.\n\nA month later, in August 1980, Serú performed at the Monterey Jazz Festival in Rio de Janeiro. In general, the Argentine musicians going to the festival were related mostly to jazz or tango sounds, while Serú proposed a progressive rock act. That year the concert had two parts: Serú Girán, American guitarist Pat Metheny and George Duke performed in the first half. The success of the Argentine band in the first half was such that the organizers offered Serú Girán to play again in the second half along with John McLaughlin, Hermeto Pascoal Egberto Gismonti, and the group Weather Report.\n\nGarcía remembers about the Monterey Jazz Festival that: \"When McLaughlin was playing, people skated and threw paper airplanes. I was dying of Embarrassment! If they did that to McLaughlin, they would throw more stuff at us\". However, his prediction was wrong. The main reason of the public's favorable response may lie in the variety of nuances in the songs, some, with a cadence that invites to dance. At this festival, Aznar met Jaco Pastorius.\n\nOn December 30, 1980, the group gave a historic free concert in La Rural, which was organized by the public TV channel ATC as part of its series of concerts \"Music forbidden for adults\". The concert drew more than 60,000 attendants, making Serú the first Argentine band to have such live audience.\n\nThe next album \"Peperina\" (1981) was marked by the excellent and impeccable compositions such as \"Llorando en el espejo\" (\"Crying in the mirror\"), \"Esperando Nacer\" (\"Waiting to be born\"), \"Cinema Verité\" (\"Truth cinema\") and \"Peperina\". The official presentation of the disc was held at Obras Sanitarias on 4, 5 and 6 September 1981. The album cover was designed by Clota Ponieman, with photos picked by him and Charly.\n\nWhen Aznar decided to leave the band to study at Berklee College of Music (Boston, Massachusetts, USA), Serú organized a series of recitals to give him a farewell. Serú Girán's future was uncertain. At beginning of 1982, the disc recorded in these concerts, \"No Llores por Mí Argentina\" (\"Don't cry for me Argentina\"), was one of the best selling ones in that year. The homonymous title became almost an anthem, and other songs like \"En la Vereda del Sol\" (\"In the sidewalk of the Sun\"), \"Cuánto tiempo más llevará\" (\"How much longer will it take\") and \"Eiti Leda\" made this record an essential album.\n\nLater this year, the confrontations of García, Lebón and Moro (in particular the first two) on how to replace Aznar and the group's future made the band dissolve.\n\nMany years passed until the comeback of Serú Girán became a reality. García, Moro, Lebón and Aznar reunited in the early 1990s to make their last studio album, \"Serú '92\" (1992), and embark on a tour that would be their last.\n\nWith the return of Serú, presentations were made in Rosario, Córdoba (in stadium Chateau Carreras), Montevideo (Centenario Stadium) and in Buenos Aires, with two performances at the stage of River Plate Stadium, the latter to gather 160.000 fans in total; the return of Serú marked a national record unthinkable for the country decades before: a local band playing a massive concert at a stadium, a place that was not the usual venue for this kind of gathering. Nevertheless, since then it has become a staple of popular rock bands in Argentina to play at soccer stadiums.\n\nIn 1993 the band released his second live album -and last live album, chronologically-, \"En vivo\" (\"Live\").\n\nDrummer Oscar Moro died of a stomach hemorrhage in July 2006. The members of the band have since stated that there will not be a definitive reunion of Serú without Moro.\n\nIn late March and early April 2007, Pedro Aznar and David Lebón played a series of concerts together in the ND Ateneo theater. In their fifth show, on April 6, Charly García joined them on stage to play \"Seminare\". On July 26, 2007, a year after the passing of Moro, a tribute concert was organized in his honor, in which Charly García and Pedro Aznar played \"Desarma y sangra\" (\"Disarm and bleed\"), \"Encuentro con el Diablo\", \"Mientras miro las nuevas olas\" and \"Esperando nacer\".\n\nOn April 30, 2010, Lebón and Aznar were guest players during García's show at Luna Park Stadium to play \"Seminare\".\n\nThey were awarded in the categories:\n\n"}

It has a population of 85,420 () and is located west of the city of Buenos Aires. It is most famous as the hometown of former first lady of Argentina, Eva Peron.\n\nInhabited by the native Charrúa people, the site's strategic location on the Salado River made it of interest to Spanish Viceroy Juan José de Vértiz y Salcedo, who established an outpost there in the 1790s as part of a line of defense against raids by displaced natives. The location became known as \"El Potroso\".\n\nEl Potroso was reinforced by a fort by way of an 1826 decree by President Bernardino Rivadavia, and on December 27, 1827, the citadel was established under the command of a veteran of the Argentine War of Independence, Bernardino Escribano, as \"Fuerte de la Federación\". The advent of Buenos Aires Province Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas led to Escribano's 1829 destitution as commander; though the intervention of an officer, Isidoro Suárez, averted a bloodbath. Suárez, a veteran of one of the last battles of the War for Independence (the Battle of Junín, in Perú), inadvertently gave the failing settlement its new name by his actions: \"\"Junín.\"\"\n\nPolitical conflict and ongoing Indian raids had all but destroyed Junín by the 1830s, however, and this prompted Governor Rosas to send the remaining settlers provisions and to subsidize crop farming in the surrounding, fertile pampas fields. This was followed by a pact with Ranquel Chief Santiago Yanquelén, whereby his people would defend Junín against raids by other tribes. Towards the end of his rule, Rosas appointed José Seguí, among the few Afro Argentines to achieve a commissioned officer's rank, to administer Junín, in 1851. Seguí was an efficient, though repressive commander, and in 1863, he was assassinated at his nearby ranch.\n\nRosas' 1852 overthrow resulted in the appointment of a justice of the peace, who initially shared governing duties with the military commander. Junín's first general store (Basterreix) opened in 1860, and in 1861, Junín elected its first city council (despite being officially only a fort). The province designated the area as a county in 1864, and with nearly 2,000 inhabitants, Junín ceases to be categorized as a \"fort,\" and its first municipal master plan was laid out in 1865.\n\nThe 1880 arrival of the Central Argentine Railway and that of the Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway (B.A.& P.) in 1884 led to the town's rapid growth. The National Bank of Argentina had opened a branch there in 1892 and by the 1895 census, Junín was home to over 12,000. The town largest employer by then was the B.A.& P.'s rail equipment factory, which employed over 1,600. The City Hall was completed in 1904 and Junín was declared a \"city,\" in 1906.\n\nJunín's steady development over the subsequent decades and setting amid lakes made it a well-known regional tourist destination. A hunting club was established in 1938, and a fishermen's pier and club on Lake El Carpicho, in 1942. The Aero Club Junín (1940) became well-known following the IX International Gliding Competition, in 1963, and the nearby Borchex Municipal Park and Lake Gómez both have become popular weekend destinations since the 1960s; Lake Gómez attracted around 350,000 visitors during the 2006-07 summer season. Nearby \"Estancia La Oriental\" has attracted growing rural tourism to the area, as well.\n\nThe city is home to an important Municipal Historical Museum, probably best known for its paleontology hall and its wooly mammoth fossils, and the Ángel María de Rosa Municipal Museum of Art (1944). In a bid to further diversify the city's economy, an industrial park was authorized north of the city in 1995, and a racetrack, the \"Autódromo Eusebio Marcilla\", was opened in 2003. The closure of much of Argentina's passenger rail service during the 1990s was partly offset in Junín in part by the purchase of local rail facilities by América Latina Logística, a São Paulo-based rail transport provider operating largely in Argentina, as well as by establishment of the Junín Railworks Cooperative.\n\nThe city features numerous cinemas, as well as prominent stage theatres such as the Teatro de la Ranchería (1971). The city's first institution of higher learning, the Junín Regional University (CURJ), was established in 1990; fused with its nearby, Pergamino counterpart, it became the National University of Northwestern Buenos Aires (UNNOBA), in 2002. The public Dr. Abraham Piñeyro Emergency Hospital, opened in 1930, serves as the city's principal health care establishment; a new wing was added to the facility in 1997.\nFamous people from Junín include Argentine supermodel Yesica Toscanini, Tour de France cyclist Juan Antonio Flecha, football greats such as coach Osvaldo Zubeldía, forward Atilio García and goalie Federico Vilar, the \"wild bull of the pampas,\" boxer Luis Ángel Firpo and Elvira Rawson de Dellepiane, a militant suffragist and the second woman to receive a medical degree in Argentina; Junín was also where Eva Duarte was raised until an opportunity in radio took her to Buenos Aires, in 1935. A decade later, she became the influential Eva Perón (Evita).\n\nA fellow UCR figure, Moisés Lebensohn, founded the city's leading newsdaily, \"Democracia\", in 1931.\n\nThe city's mayor, elected in 2015, is Pablo Petrecca of Cambienos-PRO.\n\nJunín has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification \"Cfa\"). Winters are characterized with moderate temperatures during the day and cold nights. In the coldest month, July, the average high is while the average low is . Temperatures can occasionally fall below freezing during cold waves although during heat waves such as the 2009 heat wave, temperatures can reach up to when a record high of was recorded on August 29, 2009.

The soundtrack was re-issued in March 2000 with some remixing and different artwork, while the original 1998 edition (with the orange/yellow cover) went out of print shortly thereafter.\n\nThe \"Endless Harmony\" project was undertaken shortly after the death of founding member Carl Wilson, who died of lung cancer in February 1998. At this point, Brian Wilson decided that the band was officially finished and disassociated himself from any further group activity.

{"id": "2261250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2261250", "title": "Feline infectious peritonitis", "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis\n\nFeline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is the name given to a common and always fatal aberrant immune response to infection with feline coronavirus (FCoV).\n\nFCoV is a virus of the gastrointestinal tract: most infections are either asymptomatic, or cause diarrhea, especially in kittens, as maternally derived antibody wanes at between 5 and 7 weeks of age. The virus is a mutation of feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). From the gut, the virus very briefly undergoes a systemic phase, returning to the gut, from where it is shed in the feces.\nThe pathogenesis of FIP is complicated: the reductionist view is that it is entirely due to mutation of the virus, enabling it to enter, or replicate more successfully in, monocytes. The holistic approach is that FIP occurs as a result of a number of factors, including viral virulence (some strains are undoubtedly more virulent than others), and the immune status and general health of the host.\n\nFCoV is common in places where large groups of cats are housed together indoors (e.g. breeding catteries, animal shelters, etc.). The virus is shed in feces and cats become infected by ingesting or inhaling the virus, usually by sharing cat litter trays, or by the use of contaminated litter scoops or brushes transmitting infected microscopic cat litter particles to uninfected kittens and cats. FCoV can be spread in ways other than through feces as well. It can also be transmitted through different bodily fluids. FCoV is easily spread through direct contact between cats. The most common form of spreading is through saliva, as most multiple cat homes share food and water dishes. Another major form of spreading is grooming or fighting. When an infected cat grooms a healthy cat, they leave their contaminated saliva on the fur. Later, when the healthy cat goes to groom themselves, they ingest the contaminated saliva and then become infected.\n\nThere are two main forms of FIP: effusive (wet) and non-effusive (dry). While both types are fatal, the effusive form is more common (60–70% of all cases are wet) and progresses more rapidly than the non-effusive form.\n\nThe hallmark clinical sign of effusive FIP is the accumulation of fluid within the abdomen or chest, which can cause breathing difficulties. Other symptoms include lack of appetite, fever, weight loss, jaundice, and diarrhea.\n\nDry FIP will also present with lack of appetite, fever, jaundice, diarrhea, and weight loss, but there will not be an accumulation of fluid. Typically a cat with dry FIP will show ocular or neurological signs. For example, the cat may develop difficulty in standing up or walking, becoming functionally paralyzed over time. Loss of vision is another possible outcome of the disease.\n\nDiagnosis of effusive FIP has become more straightforward in recent years: detection of viral RNA in a sample of the effusion, by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is diagnostic of effusive FIP. However, that does require that a sample be sent to an external veterinary laboratory. Within the veterinary hospital there are a number of tests which can rule out a diagnosis of effusive FIP within minutes:\n\nNon-effusive FIP is more difficult to diagnose than effusive FIP because the clinical signs tend to be more vague and varied: the list of differential diagnoses is therefore much longer. Non-effusive FIP diagnosis should be considered when the following criteria are met:\n\n\nNon-effusive FIP can be ruled out as a diagnosis if the cat is seronegative, provided the antibody test has excellent sensitivity. In a study which compared various commercially available in-house FCoV antibody tests, the FCoV Immunocomb (Biogal) was 100% sensitive; the Speed F-Corona rapid immunochromatographic (RIM) test (Virbac) was 92.4% sensitive and the FASTest feline infectious peritonitis (MegaCor Diagnostik) RIM test was 84.6% sensitive.\n\nBecause FIP is an immune-mediated disease, treatment falls into two categories: direct action against the virus itself and modulation of the immune response.\n\nThe most commonly available antiviral drugs for treating FIP are either feline recombinant interferon omega (Virbagen Omega, Virbac) or human interferon. Since the action of interferon is species-specific, feline interferon is more efficacious than human interferon.\n\nAn experimental drug called GS-441524 was used in a field trial of 31 cats. After 25 days, five cats had died, eight had been cured and subsequently relapsed, and 18 had been cured without any subsequent relapses. The eight who relapsed were treated again, some with higher doses. Of these eight, one died and seven were cured, meaning that 25 of the 31 cats were ultimately cured of FIP. Although the drug is not yet (as of 2019) commercially available in the United States, this study is considered very promising and may lead to commercially available medication for the treatment of FIP.\n\nAn experimental antiviral drug called GC 376 was used in a field trial of 20 cats: 7 cats went into remission, 13 cats responded initially but relapsed and were euthanized. This drug is not yet (as of 2017) commercially available.\n\nThe go-to immunosuppressive drug in FIP is prednisolone.\n\nAn experimental polyprenyl immunostimulant (PI) is manufactured by Sass and Sass and tested by Dr. Al Legendre, who described survival over 1 year in three cats diagnosed with FIP and treated with the medicine. In a subsequent field study of 60 cats with non-effusive FIP treated with PI, 52 cats (87%) died before 200 days, but eight cats survived over 200 days from the start of PI treatment for and four of those survived beyond 300 days.\n\nVaccination\n\nThere is one intra-nasal FIP vaccine available: its use is controversial but in an independent study the authors concluded that vaccination can protect cats with no or low FCoV antibody titres and that in some cats vaccine failure was probably due to pre-existing infection. There is no substantial evidence that proves that the vaccine created for the prevention of FIP is effective or safe. Studies have been done proving both that the vaccine does and doesn't work. However, due to the different forms of the disease and the fact that it can affect cats differently due to genetics, there is no guarantee that the vaccine will be effective one hundred percent of the time.\n\nPrevention of FCoV infection, and therefore FIP, in kittens\n\nKittens are protected from infection by maternally derived antibody until it weans, usually around 5–7 weeks of age, therefore it is possible to prevent infection of kittens by removing them from sources of infection. However, FCoV is a very contagious virus and such prevention does require rigorous hygiene.\n\nA 2018 film titled \"Aeris\" by Paul Castro Jr. and Aly Miller, and starring Frank Deal, Arabella Oz and Betsy Aidem, is about a kitten born with FIP that is purchased from a pet store and the owners' twelve days with it. The film received an award at the 2018 Garden State Film Festival in the Narrative Short category and was a Gold Kahuna winner at the 2018 Honolulu Film Awards.\n\n\n"}

It was written ca. 1830 by Jens Christian Djurhuus.\n\nThe song has 86 verses and is in Faeroese, and deals with the Norwegian king Olaf Tryggvason. The title \"Ormurin Langi\" refers to Olaf Tryggvason's ship with the same name (Ormrinn Langi in Old Norse).\n\nAround 1800 there was an increasing amount of attention paid to the store of Faroese folk ballads (kvæði), which survived in the oral tradition and were sung as an accompaniment to Faroese dancing. Even before 1800 Jens Christian Svabo had recorded ballads, but collecting got under way seriously after 1800, and names like Johan Henrik Schrøter, Jóannes í Króki and later on, V. U. Hammershaimb can be mentioned in this regard.\n\nThe old ballads were seen as having special historical value, but there was also interest in more recent ballads, e.g. comic ballads (táttur), and new ballads were composed in the old style. One poet who attracts particular notice is Jens Christian Djurhuus (1773–1853), who was a farmer in Kollafjørður. The most famous of his works is \"Ormurin Langi\", \"The Ballad of the Long Serpent\". His most individual work, however, is perhaps \"Púkaljómur\" (‘The Devils Ballad’), a religious epic based on a Danish translation of ‘Paradise Lost’ by the 17th-century English poet John Milton.\n\nOtherwise he mainly takes the subject matter for his ballads from the Norse sagas, e.g. ‘Heimskringla’ (‘The Chronicle of the Kings of Norway’) and ‘Færeyinga saga’, the story of how the Faroes were converted to Christianity under Sigmundur Brestisson and with the resistance of Tróndur í Gøtu. This was the Romantic Age, and Norse literature was very much in vogue. Everything indicates that the Faroese immediately took his poetry to their hearts. In an account of a journey written in 1847-48 the ballad collector and clergyman V. U. Hammershaimb writes: \n\n\"Ormurin Langi\" takes its subject matter from the account well given in Heimskringla of the famous sea battle off the island of Svolder in 1000, when the Swedish and Danish kings, together with the Norwegian Eiríkr Hákonarson, attacked the Norwegian king, Olaf Tryggvason, while he was on his way home from Wendland to Norway on his ship, the \"Long Serpent\", accompanied by his fleet.\n\nThey attack in turn and King Olaf repulses the assaults of the two kings, but is defeated by his countryman Eiríkr Hákonarson.\n\nThe outcome of the battle is known; when Olaf realises that the battle is lost, he leaps overboard together with his surviving men. \nIt is not known where this battle took place, with it being doubtful whether there ever was an island called Svolder.\n\nIn the ballad the poet has Olaf sailing from the Baltic into the Oresund between Denmark and Sweden, where he imagines the island to be located, and the battle takes place in the straits between the island and the mainland.\n\nVarious scenes from the drama described in the ballad appear on ten stamps, issued in 2006 by Postverk Føroya and designed by the artist Vigdis Sigmundsdóttir. They show shipbuilding and a launch, with the king sitting on the throne while giving an audience to Einarr Thambarskelfir. Another one shows the fleet putting out to sea. Another shows the \"Long Serpent\" and the other ships heading into the straits while their adversaries stand on the shore watching them. In the \"Long Serpent's\" bow there is Ulf the Red, Olaf's forecastle man, while the king and Einar the Archer are seen up on the quarterdeck. There are dead bodies tumbling into the sea during the battle, which ends with Eiríkr Hákonarson capturing the Long Serpent and so taking command of the vessel.\n\nThe location where the song is composed is unknown.\n\nThe oldest version dates back to 1819 and was made by Jóannes í Króki of Sandur. He also collected a version in 1823.\n\nWhen Svend Grundtvig and Jørgen Bloch edited \"Føroya kvæði\", an anthology of Faroese folksongs, around 1880, they knew of six recordings of the ballad. \nA version in the poet's own hand turned up at a later date, but it is not known when it dates from.\n\nNowadays the ballad is referred to as \"Ormurin Langi\" (i.e. \"The Long Serpent\"), but that was not the title used by the poet himself. \nHe referred to it as \"Olaf Trygvasons kvad\" (\"The Ballad of Olaf Trygvason\"), and other recorders did that as well, including Jóannes í Króki.\n\nIt was not until a version from around 1846 that it was discovered that the song got its title from Olaf Trygvason's ship, (\"Ormurin langi\"). \nWhen Hammershaimb had the ballad printed in his principal work, \"Færøsk Anthologi\" (A Faroese Anthology) of 1891, he used the title \"Ormurin langi\", and the same title was used when it was serialised a few years earlier (1882) in the Dimmalætting newspaper.\n\nThe lyrics of the ballad vary slightly from version to version, but when the ballad is performed today, it is always in the form known from \"Færøsk Anthologi\".\n\nNor do the old versions agree on which refrain (and therefore which tune) to use. The refrain that reigns supreme today is found in only one of the oldest versions. It is the one used in Færøsk Anthologi and is, incidentally, familiar from some of the old ballads. \"Færøsk Anthologi\" has had a standardising effect and its text has in some ways become the authorised version.\n\nThe song appears in the Icelandic Viking movie \"In the Shadow of the Raven\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2261305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2261305", "title": "Offline editing", "text": "Offline editing\n\nOffline editing is part of the post-production process of filmmaking and television production in which raw footage is copied and the copy only is then edited, thereby not affecting the camera original film stock or video tape. Once the project has been completely offline edited, the original media will be assembled in the online editing stage.\n\nThe term offline originated in the computing and telecommunications industries, meaning \"\"not under the direct control of another device\"\" (automation).\n\nModern offline video editing is conducted in a non-linear editing (NLE) suite. The digital revolution has made the offline editing workflow process immeasurably quicker, as practitioners moved from time-consuming (video tape to tape) linear video editing online editing suites, to computer hardware and video editing software such as Adobe Premiere, Final Cut Pro, Avid, Sony Vegas, Lightworks and VideoPad. Typically, all the original footage (often tens or hundreds of hours) is digitized into the suite at a low resolution. The editor and director are then free to work with all the options to create the final cut. Therefore, the offline editing stage is the creative storytelling stage that defines the structure, mood, pacing and story of the final show. Many versions and revisions are done at this stage until the edit gets to a stage known as picture lock. This is when it then moves onto the following stages of post production known as online editing, colour grading and audio mixing.\n\nFilm editing used an offline approach almost from the beginning. Film editors worked with a workprint of the original film negative to protect the negative from handling damage. When two-inch quadraplex video tape recording was first introduced by Ampex in 1956, it could not be physically cut and spliced as simply and cleanly as film negatives could be. One error-prone method option was to cut the tape with a razor blade. Since there was no visible frame line on the tape, a special ferrofluid developing solution was applied to the tape, allowing the editor to view the recorded control track pulse under a microscope, and thus determine where one frame ended and the next began. This process was not always exact, and if imperfectly performed would lead to picture breakup when the cut was played. Generally this process was used to assemble scenes together, not for creative editing.\n\nThe second option for video editing was to use two tape machines, one playing back the original tapes, and the other recording that playback. The original tapes were pre rolled, manually cued to a few seconds prior to the start of a shot on the player, while the recorder was set to record. Each machine was rolled forward simultaneously, and a punch in recording, similar to punch in / out of early audio multitrack recordings was made at the appropriate moment. Beyond not being very precise, recorders of this era cost much more than a house, making this process an expensive use of the machines. This technique of re-recording from source to edit master came to be known as linear video editing.\n\nThis was the way things were for television shows shot on tape for the first 15 years. Even such fast-paced shows as \"Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In\" continued to use the razor blade technique.\n\nThree developments of the late sixties and early seventies revolutionized video editing, and made it possible for television to have its own version of the film workprint/conform process.\n\nThe first was the invention of time code. Whereas film negative had numbers printed optically along the side of the film, so that every frame could be identified exactly, video tape had no such system. Only video, audio, and a control pulse were recorded. Early attempts to rectify this were primitive to say the least. An announcer reciting the seconds was recorded onto an audio channel on the tape. Time code introduced frame precision, by recording a machine readable signal on an audio channel. A time code reader device translated this signal into hours, minutes, seconds and frames, originally displayed on a Nixie tube display, and later with LED readouts. This innovation made it possible for the editor to note the exact frames at which to make a cut, and thus be much more precise. He could create a paper edit by writing down the numbers of the first and last frames of each shot, and then arrange them in order on paper prior to the actual edit session with the expensive VTRs.\n\nAlthough video technology had the potential to be cheaper since it doesn't have the costs of film stock and have to go through the development process respectively, the quality of early video recording technology in the 1950s and even into the mid 1960s was often far too low to be taken seriously against the aesthetical look, familiarity and relative ease of editing of 16mm and 35mm film stock – which many television cinematographers used well up until the late 1980s in documentaries, dramas etc. before video technology caught up to being 'acceptable' as television cameras and camcorders eventually displaced film stock for regular television use as they became lighter and more practical to take with them. Because early video cameras were so large and so expensive, it wasn't until 1984 with the JVC VHS-C camcorder that consumers had access to video tape technology.\n\nProfessionally, early video cameras were designated mostly for studio use, as up until the mid-1980s, when the camera unit and recorder unit merged as a camcorder (CAMera-reCORDER) as their bulky size made them far too big and bulky to be used outside against the smaller and more practical film camera.\n\nFor example, British sitcom Only Fools and Horses used videotape for internal scenes, but used film stock for external scenes for lighting reasons – it was difficult with tube sensors to get a stable, quality image without them needing a lot of lighting.\n\nThe second development was cheaper video recorders. Though not suitable for broadcast use directly, these provided a way to make a copy of the master, with its time code visibly inserted into a small box or 'time code window' in the picture. This tape could then be played in an office or at home on a video recorder costing only as much as a used car. The editor would note down the numbers of the shots and decide the order. They might simply write them in a list, or they might dub from one of these small machines to another to create a rough cut edit, and note the necessary frame numbers by watching this tape.\n\nThough both of these developments helped greatly, effectively creating the offline editing method, they didn't solve the problem of precisely controlling the video recorder for frame accurate editing. That required precise control of the tape transport mechanism, using a dedicated edit controller that could read the time code and perform an edit exactly on cue.\n\nThat innovation came about as a result of research conducted by CMX, a joint venture of the CBS and Memorex corporations. The intent was to create a much less haphazard method of editing video directly that had all of the creative control of traditional film editing. The result, the CMX 600, accomplished this goal with a two part process. Camera master tapes were dubbed as black and white analog video to very large computer memory discs. The editor could access any shot exactly, and quickly edit a precise black and white, low quality version of the program. More importantly, re-editing was trivial, as no cuts were actually performed. The shots were simply accessed and played in sequence from the disc in real time. The computer kept track of all the numbers in this offline stage of the process, and when the editor was satisfied, output them as an Edit decision list (EDL). This EDL was used in the final stage of the process, the online edit. To make it work, special computer to video tape recorder (VTR) edit interfaces had to be developed, called I-Squareds. Under the control of a computer reading back the EDL and communications protocols, these I-Squareds took control and shuttled the broadcast quality VTRs exactly to the points necessary to record and edit master with exact edits from the source tapes.\n\nThough recording to computer disc pack and this first attempt at non-linear editing on video was abandoned as too expensive, the rest of the hardware was recycled into the offline/online edit process that remained dominant in television production for the next 20 years or more.\n\nAlthough tape formats changed from open reels to videocassettes (VCR), and all the equipment rapidly became much cheaper, the basics of the process remained the same. An editor would offline on a less expensive, low quality format, before entering the online editing suite with an EDL and master source tapes, to finish the broadcast quality version of the television show.\nEven after the transition to digital the concept is the same, with low resolution proxy files streaming from central media storage during editing and the full quality video only getting brought up from deep storage once the clip is committed and rendered.\n\n"}

Mootz is best known as The Panacea (until 2005, simply as Panacea), his drum and bass stage name and main musical project, and as m (pronounced \"Squaremeter\"), his dark ambient side project and alter-ego.\n\nBorn August 18, 1976 in Wetzlar, Germany, Mootz served an apprenticeship in classical music and was a member of the boy's choir of Windsbach. After studying music engineering at the SAE Institute, Mootz worked with the experimental hip hop/illbient label Chrome, an offshoot of Force Inc Music Works. Over the course of several drum and bass albums and many singles, and as A&R manager for Chrome, later renamed Position Chrome, Panacea became known for pushing the bounds of the drum and bass genre into industrial and hardcore territory, and for energetic DJ sets which fused these genres in a live setting. With his side project m, he explored a more minimal side of electronic music, first in the realm of clicks 'n' cuts, and later in the dark ambient territory pioneered by the likes of Lustmord. Mootz lives and produces in Sommerhausen, a countryside town near Würzburg.\nMootz experimented with hip hop/illbient in the mid-1990s, an offshoot of Force Inc Music Works. Under the name Panacea, he released a string of dark drum and bass singles on the label in 1996, followed by the LPs \"Low Profile Darkness\" in 1997 and \"Twisted Designz\" in 1998, which pushed the tech step format established by the UK's Ed Rush and Nico Sykes into harsh industrial/digital hardcore territory. Mootz took over Chrome's A&R, and the label was renamed Position Chrome soon after (the label is now under ownership by Mootz), evolving into one of the first and most notable German drum and bass labels.\n\nMootz's broad musical background led him to experiment in other style, from the avant garde minimalism of his \"Brasilia\" soundtrack (part of Caipirinha's \"Architettura\" series exploring the relationship between architecture and music), to his collaboration with J-pop singer Hanayo, which saw the duo electronically re-scoring Bach's \"Ich steh an deiner Krippen hier\". A number of MCs guested on his LP \"Phoenix Metabolism\" (1999), while he refined his industrial drum and bass style on the LP \"German Engineering\" (2001). Mootz also began a number of side projects and collaborations in this period, releasing albums of raggacore (as Rich Kid), electro (as Bad Street Boy), hardcore techno (as Kate Mosh), and drum and bass with DJ Scud (as The Redeemer) and Problem Child (as Disorder). \"Sinecore\", the first album by his glitch/dark ambient ego m (pronounced \"Squaremeter\") was released in 2000 on Mille Plateaux. A further ten albums were released by this project coming over labels such as Ant-Zen and Hands Productions.\n\n\"The Hardest Tour on Planet Earth\" (2001) documented his partnership with fellow German drum and bass artist Cativo, where elements of oldskool hardcore began entering his products. \"Underground Superstar\" (2002) found him fusing early hardcore and jump-up with modern production techniques. The album included \"The Evil Seed\", a vocal track for which a music video was produced, and \"The Last Brotherhood\". Adopting an extremely energetic DJ persona, he became known for sets that were equal parts hardcore and drum and bass. He also began collaborating with Luna-C, one of the champions of the breakbeat hardcore revival known as hardcore breaks. \"Panacea Shares Needles with Tarmvred\", a collaboration with Needle Sharing and Tarmvred in 2002 on Ad Noiseam, combined drum and bass, hardcore, and noise.\n\nPosition Chrome ceased activity briefly in 2004 when Force Inc.'s distributors EFA-Medien went bankrupt, but in 2005, Mootz revived the label, changing his name to The Panacea. He has since returned to somewhat darker sounds, releasing a number of singles on Position Chrome, as well as UK labels Outbreak and Offkey Records, the latter run by UK producer Raiden and specializing in Techno-DNB.\n\nCurrently, The Panacea is part of the Anger Management booking agency roster as well as Freak Recordings, which led him to headline several events of the Therapy Sessions franchise.\n\n\nm (pronounced \"Squaremeter\") is Mootz's main side-project, originally intended as a one off clicks n' cuts release for Mille Plateaux. Over the course of several albums on prominent industrial labels Ant-Zen and Hands Productions, m became more rhythmic-orientated and gothic in tone (featuring spoken word samples from a BBC radio adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Silmarillion\"), with prominent Arabic influences. The most recent releases eschewed the vocal samples, digital edits and heavy industrial rhythms in favour of spacious soundscapes and dark, brooding ambient in the vein of pioneers such as Lustmord. m also performs live at events such as Maschinenfest.\n\n\n"}

The cassette release contained the same track listing but with full versions of all tracks.\n\n\"Just to See You Smile\" originally appeared on the B-side of \"Hypnotized\", in an alternate mix listed as \"Just to See You Smile (Honey Pt. 2)\", owning up to the track's melodic affinity to the earlier Spacemen 3 tune \"Honey\". Elsewhere, \"Why Couldn't I See\" is another song whose main guitar riff is largely derived from the 45-minute improvisation \"Dreamweapon\" (the others were \"Honey\" and \"How Does It Feel\"); and \"I Love You\" features an uncredited sample of a Jan and Dean radio jingle for Coca-Cola (possibly written or cowritten by Brian Wilson, from 1963.)\n\nThe only track on which both Pierce and Kember appear is \"When Tomorrow Hits\", a cover of a Mudhoney song, originally intended for a double A-side split single, with Mudhoney covering \"Revolution\" from \"Playing With Fire\". This release was scotched when Kember caught wind of the fact that Mudhoney had fitted \"Revolution\" with somewhat irreverent lyrics about methadone suppositories. The Mudhoney recording eventually surfaced as a b-side. There's a subtle continuity between both tracks, specifically duelling references to The Stooges; the Spacemen 3 track opens with the \"look out!\" invocation that began \"Loose\", and \"When Tomorrow Hits\" is mostly a rewrite of \"I Wanna Be Your Dog\".\n\n"}

The chorale cantata is based on the hymn \"\" by Johann Heermann.\n\nBach wrote the cantata in his second year in Leipzig for the 19th Sunday after Trinity and first performed it on 15 October 1724. It is part of his second annual cycle of cantatas, a cycle of chorale cantatas. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians – \"put on the new man, which after God is created\" () – and from the Gospel of Matthew, Healing the paralytic at Capernaum ().\n\nThe cantata text is based on the hymn in eleven stanzas \"\" by Johann Heermann, published in 1630, which is recommended for the Sunday in the \"Dresdner Gesangbuch.\" An unknown poet kept the first and last stanzas as the respective cantata movements. He paraphrased the other stanzas rather freely: 2 and 3 as movement 2, 4 as movement 3, 5 to 7 as movement 4, 8 as movement 5, and 9 and 10 as movement 6. A year before, Bach had composed for the occasion \"Ich elender Mensch, wer wird mich erlösen\", BWV 48, concentrating on the promise of Jesus to the sick man: \"Your sins are forgiven\". Similarly, the awareness of being a sinner who needs healing is the theme of Heermann's chorale and this cantata. The poetry adds to the chorale images which the composer could use, for example in movement 3, the divine source of blood to cleanse the stains of sins, a Baroque phrase relying on , and . In movement 5 the poet invented a ferocious, hellish army, which is silenced by the believer who shows the blood of Jesus.\n\nBach first performed the cantata on 15 October 1724. The autograph score to the cantata, now in the Stefan Zweig Collection of the British Library, was once owned by Joseph Joachim.\n\nThe cantata in seven movements is scored for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass), a four-part choir, tromba da tirarsi (slide trumpet), two oboes, two violins, viola and basso continuo.\n\nBach arranged the movements in symmetry around movement 4 as the turning point in the cantata between desolation and hope, a recitative, which receives added weight by the cantus firmus of the chorale played by the oboe. One line of the chorale stanza is sung unchanged: \"\" (the sins I committed).\nIn the opening chorus Bach gave the tune in unadorned long notes to the soprano, reinforced by the trumpet. The vocal parts are embedded in an independent instrumental concerto. The motifs of the instruments, which also appear in the lower voices, are derived from the tune, following the upward movement of its first line and the downward movement of its second line. Both other recitatives are secco. The first aria is accompanied only by an obbligato viola illustrating the flow of blood, termed by John Eliot Gardiner the \"gushing, curative effect of the divine spring\" in \"tumbling liquid gestures\", summarized as \"the cleansing motions of some prototype baroque washing machine\". The tenor sings the same figuration on the word \"\" (washing). Bach used the solo viola only rarely in his cantatas (twice, according to Boyd); he may have played these solos himself. The second aria is accompanied by the full orchestra with the trumpet as a \"ferociously demanding obbligato\". In sudden breaks it conveys the silencing of \"\" (Be silent, host of hell). Different as the two arias are, the figuration in the second one is similar to the one in the first, interpreting that it is the very flow of blood which silences the \"army of hell\". The closing chorale is set for four parts.\n\n\n"}

In January 1945, during World War II, he led a force of 121 Army Rangers on a mission which rescued 513 survivors of the Bataan Death March from Cabanatuan Prison Camp, despite being heavily outnumbered. It is widely considered the most successful rescue mission in the history of the United States military.\n\nMucci was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, to parents who had emigrated from Sicily, Italy.\n\nToday, a section of the United States Embassy in Rome, Italy is named in Mucci's honor.\n\nHenry came from a family of 10 siblings. Two of his brothers also served in the Army and Navy during the Second World War, while his sisters worked at the Veterans of Foreign Wars in America and made bazookas in factories.\n\nHe enrolled at the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, graduating 246th of 275 in his class in May 1936. While at West Point he participated in lacrosse and, due to his early years growing up with horses, was on the equestrian team.\n\nIn February 1943, the US Sixth Army put Mucci in charge of the 98th Field Artillery Battalion, previously a mule-drawn pack artillery unit. Mucci announced that the Battalion was being converted from Field Artillery to Rangers, downsized the battalion from 1,000 men to 500, and held a training camp in New Guinea where he utilized commando type training techniques for over a year. Thus, Mucci created a new battalion of Army Rangers. Mucci survived the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. During the liberation of the Philippines, General Walter Kreuger and one of his top men, Col. Horton White, chose Mucci to head the liberation of the Cabanatuan Prison Camp due to both the difficulty and the peculiar needs of such a mission.\n\nIn January 1945, Mucci led 120 Army Rangers in liberating the Cabanatuan Prison Camp with the loss of only two men killed in action. The raid was supported by some 250 Filipino guerrillas, many of whom were unarmed, who guided the Rangers through Japanese held territory and held off Japanese reinforcements while the American Rangers freed the POWs.\n\nFor Mucci's actions in the raid he was personally awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by General of the Army Douglas MacArthur.\n\nMucci returned home as a national hero in his home town of Bridgeport, Connecticut.\n\nIn 1947, he married Marion Fountain, with whom he had three children.\n\nHe ran for Congress in 1946 but was defeated. He became the President of Bridgeport Lincoln Mercury as well as becoming an oil representative in India.\n\nIn November 1974, the portion of Route 25 between Bridgeport and Newtown was named the Col. Henry A. Mucci Highway.\n\nColonel Mucci died at age 88 in Melbourne, Florida, on April 20, 1997, as the result of a stroke, being a complication of a fractured hip sustained at age 86, while swimming in rough surf near his home.\n\nThe raid on Cabanatuan was depicted in the 2005 film \"The Great Raid\", which featured actor Benjamin Bratt depicting Mucci, Bratt bearing a remarkable facial resemblance to Mucci.\n\nHenry Mucci received the following military awards:\n\n"}

An international co-production between South Korea and Japan, the film stars Jae Hee as a young drifter who develops a relationship with an abused housewife (Lee Seung-yeon). The film's title is derived from a type of golf club used prominently throughout the narrative.\n\n\"3-Iron\" premiered in competition at the 61st Venice International Film Festival in September 2004, where it was nominated for the Golden Lion and won Kim the Silver Lion for Best Direction. It was released in South Korea on April 29, 2005, and received generally positive reviews and numerous accolades, including the FIPRESCI Grand Prix award at the San Sebastián Film Festival.\n\nTae-suk (Jae Hee) is a loner who drives around on his motorbike, taping takeout menus over the keyholes of front doors and breaking into apartments where the menus have not been removed. He lives in those apartments while their owners are away, washing their clothes, mending their broken appliances, and taking selfies with their possessions. When he breaks into one large home, he is unaware that he is being watched by an abused housewife and former model Sun-hwa (Lee Seung-yeon). Tae-suk leaves after making eye contact with Sun-hwa, but then returns. He witnesses Sun-hwa's husband Min-gyu abusing her and proceeds to catch his attention by practicing golf in the yard. He buffets Min-gyu with golf balls and then leaves with Sun-hwa.\n\nTae-suk and Sun-hwa begin a silent relationship, moving from one apartment to another, with Tae-suk occasionally practicing hitting golf balls by drilling holes in them, inserted a cord through the holes, and securing the cords with a knot around the bases of tree trunks. In one home, after drinking, they are caught by the returning owners, sleeping in their bed and wearing their pajamas. The male homeowner, a boxer, repeatedly punches Tae-suk. Later, Tae-suk practices hitting a golf ball tied to a tree, and the ball breaks loose from its cord, breaking through the windshield of a nearby car and brutally striking the car's passenger in their head. Tae-suk, awash with guilt, is comforted by Sun-hwa.\n\nThe next night, Tae-suk and Sun-hwa break into a hanok, where they sit quietly, drink tea, and share a kiss. They later enter an apartment where they discover the dead body of an elderly man. They proceed to give him a proper burial. The following day, the elderly man's son and daughter-in-law arrive at the apartment, and assume that Tae-suk and Sun-hwa killed him. Tae-suk and Sun-hwa are apprehended and interrogated by police, but remain silent. Tae-suk's camera is confiscated, and the owners of the homes seen in the photos on the camera are contacted. The police learn that nothing was stolen from any of the houses, and an investigation reveals that the old man died of lung cancer. Min-gyu arrives to take Sun-hwa home, and bribes the policeman in charge of the investigation to allow him to strike Tae-suk with golf balls. Tae-suk ends up attacking the police officer and is sent to jail. There, he practices golf with an imaginary club and balls and develops his gifts for stealth and concealment, frustrating his jailers by remaining out of sight.\n\nTae-suk is released from prison, and Min-gyu prepares himself in case he returns for Sun-hwa. With his improved stealth, Tae-suk is able to rejoin Sun-hwa in her house, using his skills to evade Min-gyu's detection. Sun-hwa appears to say \"I love you\" to Min-gyu and embraces him, but kisses Tae-suk over his shoulder. When Min-gyu leaves on a business trip, Sun-hwa and Tae-suk stand together on a scale. Text then appears, reading: \"It's hard to tell whether the world we live in is either a reality or a dream.\"\n\n\nAccording to author Hye Seung Chung, the use of silence in \"3-Iron\" evokes the writing of Hungarian film theorist Béla Balázs, who described silence as \"one of the most dramatic effects of the sound film\". The film's use of silence is partly derived by Kim's experiences in Paris, France, where he learned to understand other people by observing their expressions and behavior, despite him not being able understand the French language. In a 2005 interview with \"Time Out\", Kim stated: \"I want the audience to watch the characters more closely by reducing the dialogue as much as possible. Most movies have too much dialogue; I don't think words make everything understandable\".\n\n\"3-Iron\" has also been described as exploring social status and \"issues of marginality, voicelessness, and invisibility\" in South Korea. Seung Chung describes Tae-suk and Sun-hwa—presented at varying points in the film as either inaudible or invisible—as being \"of liminal class affiliations.\" Writer Sheng-mei Ma similarly notes Sun-hwa and Tae-suk as being \"marginalized, 'half-human' protagonists\". Tae-suk is depicted as a transient with no known family, and from dialogue in which Min-gyu recounts having wired money to Sun-hwa's family, it can be inferred that he and Sun-hwa are in an interclass marriage, with Sun-hwa hailing from a family of lower economic status than Min-gyu. Ma writes that the film uses \"the universal symbol of golf as a sign of affluence\", with Tae-suk, \"not yet awakened from the dream of social status and power, [... copying] the lifestyle of the rich through golf practice.\" He notes that Sun-hwa \"instinctively tries to stop that emulation\", but fails, resulting in Tae-suk striking an innocent woman with a stray ball.\n\nWriting of the latter half of the film, Seung Chung describes Tae-suk as \"literally [becoming] invisible after mastering the ability to hide in the shadowy jail cell, outside the purview of human vision, through metaphysical 'ghost practice\". The term \"ghost practice\" () was coined by Kim himself and used in a number of local interviews about \"3-Iron\". Film critic A. O. Scott, in his review of the film for \"The New York Times\", suggests that Tae-suk \"becomes a phantom of cinema, hiding on the edge of the frame and taking advantage of the literal-minded folk who haven't fully grasped the potential of the medium.\" Seung Chung wrote that the final shot of the film, in which Sun-hwa and Tae-suk stand together on a scale that displays a weight of zero, implies the couple's \"mutual transcendence of bodily existence.\" Ma refers to the ending as \"ambiguous\", writing that Sun-hwa \"may well be imagining a union with her ghost lover, or their love may have indeed freed them from their bodies.\"\n\nIn a 2004 interview with Kim for \"Cine 21\", Chong Song-il interpreted Tae-suk as \"Sun-hwa's fantasy\", serving as a figure of rescue from her abusive marriage. This interpretation was corroborated by Kim, but Kim also suggested an interpretation wherein Sun-hwa is a figment of Tae-suk's imagination, delivering him from his solitary visits to empty houses.\n\n\"3-Iron\" premiered in competition at the 61st Venice International Film Festival in September 2004.\n\nThe film opened in South Korea on April 29, 2005, and went on to gross $241,914 domestically. It grossed $3,403,957 worldwide.\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 87% based on 92 reviews, with an average score of 7.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"A tender and moving romance from \"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... And Spring\"s director Kim Ki-Duk.\" The film holds a score of 72 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 28 reviews, indicating \"Generally favorable reviews\".\n\nA. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" noted the \"sophisticated modern sound design\" exhibited in \"3-Iron\", and called the film \"a teasing, self-conscious and curiously heartfelt demonstration of [Kim's] mischievous formal ingenuity.\" Dennis Schwartz of \"Ozus' World Movie Reviews\" called the film \"an unusual original story that's rooted in a Buddhist parable [...] of seeing the world as a dream\". James Mudge of \"Beyond Hollywood\" called it \"an almost ethereal, yet truly captivating film which is fascinating and moving\", writing that \"it is quite likely that viewers will not even realize the lack of dialogue\". Jamie Woolley of BBC.com gave the film three out of five stars, writing: \"\"3-Iron\" isn't going to win any prizes for furthering of the cause of female emancipation.

He was the first to observe radial motions in sunspots, a phenomenon known as the Evershed effect.\n\nEvershed was born in Gomshall, Surrey to John and Sophia (née Price) Evershed. He made the discovery which bears his name while at Kodaikanal Observatory in 1909. After retirement in 1923 he set up a private observatory at Ewhurst, Surrey and built a large spectroheliograph of special design and another with high-dispersion liquid prism. He continued to study the wave-lengths of H and K lines in prominences, giving values of the solar rotation at high levels in different latitudes and at different phases of the solar cycle. Work continued until 1950 when the observatory closed and he presented some of his instruments to the Royal Greenwich Observatory at Herstmonceux. He was a founder member of the British Astronomical Association. He directed its Solar Spectroscopy Section (1893-1899) and Spectroscopic Section (1924-1926).\n\nIn 1894 Evershed was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, in 1918 he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May, 1915. The Evershed crater on the Moon is named in his honor. He was awarded as a Companion of the Indian Empire on his retirement in 1923.\n\nEvershed was married to fellow astronomer Mary Acworth Orr Evershed, with whom he co-authored some work. He died in Ewhurst, Surrey on 17 November 1956.\nHe also had interest in lepidoptera and other insects. W. H. Evans described a butterfly and named it after Evershed(Thoressa evershedi-Evans, 1910) as the first specimen was collected by Evershed. In 2015 his archive was acquired by the Science Museum, London.\n\n"}

He is best known for his time in WWE as Kenny Dykstra and Kenny as a member of The Spirit Squad. Outside of WWE, his most significant appearance in a major promotion was for Major League Wrestling (MLW) in a tag team with Squad member Mike Mondo during 2019.\n\nDoane was trained by Killer Kowalski, and made his wrestling debut at the age of fifteen in 2001. He began working for Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), per WWE request. In May 2003, Doane made his WWE television debut as \"Ken Phoenix\". During his time in OVW, he won the Television Championship once. After losing the title, Doane became part of The Spirit Squad faction. The team debuted on Raw in January 2006, and won the World Tag Team Championship three months later. \n\nFollowing the Spirit Squad's dissolution, he began working as \"Kenny Dykstra\", before being released from his WWE contract in November 2008. He later began working on the independent circuit, wrestling for promotions including Dragon Gate USA and Evolve.\n\nDoane made his professional wrestling debut in 2001 at the age of fifteen. He started his professional wrestling career in the New England area under the name \"Broadway\" Kenn Phoenix. He was later trained by professional wrestler and trainer Killer Kowalski in Malden, Massachusetts. After being contacted by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), he was asked to make appearances for their developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). Doane made his first national television appearance in WWE at the age of 17 on the May 12, 2003 episode of \"WWE Raw\" as Ken Phoenix. Along with his brother, Mike Phoenix, he was a participant in Rodney Mack's ongoing \"5-Minute White Boy Challenge\" where Mack defeated Caucasian wrestlers in under five minutes. Mack defeated the pair in 1:31, forcing them both to submit to his new Blackout finishing hold. He made another appearance, losing to Lance Storm on an episode of \"Sunday Night Heat\" before being officially signed to a developmental deal and to OVW full-time on June 4, 2004. On June 3, 2005, Doane had his first match, at the promotion, against Kenzo Suzuki, whom Doane defeated. Three weeks later, on June 25, 2005, he won the Television Championship from Deuce Shade. He had successful title defenses, but Doane lost the title to CM Punk on November 9, 2005.\n\nAfter losing the Television Championship, Doane became a part of the Spirit Squad, a faction using the in-ring personas of male cheerleaders, using the name \"Kenny\". On the January 23, 2006, episode of \"Raw\", the group helped Jonathan Coachman win a Royal Rumble qualifying match against Jerry \"The King\" Lawler by performing cheers for Coachman and distracting Lawler. They later became a part of the ongoing scripted feud between WWE chairman Vince McMahon and Shawn Michaels. The villainous McMahon brought in the Squad to attack Michaels on numerous occasions, including placing them in multiple handicap matches.\nThey also continued wrestling in the tag team division, and on April 3, on \"Raw\", the Squad won the World Tag Team Championship when Kenny and Mikey, with outside help from the other three Squad members, defeated the team of Big Show and Kane. After winning the championship, all five members of the team were recognized as the champions, allowing any combination of them to defend the championship. Also, Kenny became the second youngest wrestler to win a title in WWE at the age of 20 years and 18 days; he was surpassed by Tyler Bate in 2017.\n\nThree weeks later, McMahon scheduled another handicap match, with the Spirit Squad facing Michaels. The match never started, however; instead the Spirit Squad brutally beat down Michaels, ripping apart his ring attire and, as part of the storyline, shattered his knee with a chair. McMahon then called Triple H to the ring to attack Michaels with a sledgehammer; however, Kenny snatched the sledgehammer away from him, disrespecting Triple H, which led to him attacking the group. Triple H and Michaels revived their former team, D-Generation X (DX), and began a feud with the Spirit Squad. DX played various sophomoric pranks on the team and the McMahons (Vince and his son Shane), as well as defeating the Spirit Squad in handicap tag team matches at Vengeance and a clean sweep in an elimination handicap match at \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIII\".\n\nAt the same time as their feud with DX and their alignment with McMahon, the team also wrestled other teams in \"Raw\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s tag division over the World Tag Team Championship. The group successfully defended the tag team championship against the teams of Jim Duggan and Eugene, Charlie Haas and Viscera, and Snitsky and Val Venis. They then entered a lengthy feud with The Highlanders, whom they eventually defeated to retain the title at Unforgiven.\n\nThe Squad as a whole later began a losing streak with separate members losing singles matches to Ric Flair on consecutive episodes of \"Raw\". After two consecutive losses to the debuting Cryme Tyme, Kenny attacked Mikey on the October 23 episode of \"Raw\", and announced that he was going to defeat Flair. Kenny was successful, despite Flair attempting to even the odds by bringing other WWE Legends (Dusty Rhodes, Sgt. Slaughter, and \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper) to the ring with him. It was then announced that Flair and a legend, selected by interactive voting, would wrestle the team for the World Tag Team Championship at the Cyber Sunday pay-per-view in early November. The fans chose Piper, and he and Flair defeated Kenny and Mikey to win the championship.\n\nThe group disbanded on the November 27 \"Raw\" after losing a five-on-three match against Flair and DX. Later that night, DX placed all five members into a crate stamped \"OVW, Louisville, Kentucky\", a reference to the developmental territory from which the Squad had come.\n\nAfter the breakup of the Spirit Squad, he was repackaged as Kenny Dykstra – an homage to baseball player Lenny Dykstra – with new attire and entrance music. He became interested in joining the group Rated-RKO, which consisted of Edge and Randy Orton. In order to join, he was told to prove himself first. He continued the feud with Ric Flair, managing to pick up three straight victories before finally losing to him on the January 15, 2007, episode of \"Raw\". Dykstra competed in the 2007 Royal Rumble match and got eliminated by Edge. After his feud with Flair, Dykstra become a mainstay on \"Raw\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sister show \"Heat\", having feuds with both Eugene and Val Venis.\n\nHe then formed a tag team with Johnny Nitro, but the duo split when Kenny was drafted to the SmackDown! brand on June 17, 2007, as part of the WWE Supplemental Draft while Nitro was drafted to ECW.\n\nDykstra made his debut on the July 6 episode of \"SmackDown!\" in a losing effort to the re-debuting Chuck Palumbo. On the July 20 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Dykstra participated in a 20-man battle royal for the World Heavyweight Championship and was eliminated by Chris Masters; later on that evening, he lost to Matt Hardy in singles competition.\n\nDykstra formed an on-screen relationship with Victoria on the July 27 episode of \"SmackDown!\". The two teamed together in mixed tag team matches, usually against Jimmy Wang Yang and Torrie Wilson or Chuck Palumbo and Michelle McCool. They also regularly accompanied each other to the ring for matches.\n\nAfter a leave of absence from television in the first half of 2008, Dykstra made his return on the August 15 episode of \"SmackDown\", losing to WWE Champion Triple H. On November 10, 2008, WWE announced Doane had been released from his contract.\n\nIn 2009, Doane began working for Dragon Gate USA under his real name. On December 3, 2009, it was announced that Doane would be joining recently opened promotion Evolve as Kenn Doane. He debuted at the promotions first show on January 16, 2010, in a loss to Jimmy Jacobs.\n\nOn March 9, 2010, Doane, under his real name, wrestled in a tryout dark match for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, losing to Homicide. On November 15, 2011, Doane wrestled a dark match for WWE at the \"SmackDown\" tapings in Bridgeport, Connecticut, losing to Justin Gabriel.\n\nIn October 2011, Doane took part in the first season tapings of Wrestling Retribution Project (WRP), performing under the ring name \"Simply\" Stan Shooter.\n\nIn September 2014, Doane took part in Chikara's 2014 King of Trios tournament, using his Spirit Squad character and teaming with Johnny and Mikey. After a win over Sinn Bodhi and the Odditorium (Qefka the Quiet and Sir Oliver Grimsly) on September 19, the Spirit Squad was eliminated from the tournament in the second round on September 20 by the Golden Trio (Dasher Hatfield, Icarus, and Mark Angelosetti).\n\nOn November 12, 2016, wrestling as The Spirit Squad, Doane along with Mikey captured the NYWC Tag Team Championship from Hounds of Hatred (Boo and Bam Sullivan) at Firestorm 3. 15 days later, Spirit Squad lost the titles back to Hounds of Hatred.\n\nAt Ring of Honor television tapings in April 2017, Kenny and Mikey unsuccessfully challenged The Young Bucks for the ROH World Tag Team Championship.\n\nIn late 2016, Doane, as Kenny, and Mikey returned to WWE for a short storyline with Dolph Ziggler (formerly Nicky in the Spirit Squad). On October 4, on \"SmackDown\", they utilised their Spirit Squad characters to taunt Ziggler about his time in the Spirit Squad, before attacking him at the behest of the Intercontinental Champion The Miz and Maryse. Five days later, at the No Mercy pay-per-view, he and Mikey tried to distract Ziggler in his career vs. title match under Maryse's command, but were unsuccessful in doing so. On the October 11 episode of \"SmackDown\", Kenny and Mikey faced Ziggler in a two-on-one handicap match; Ziggler won but was then attacked by The Miz and saved by Rhyno and Heath Slater. This led to a six-man tag team match the following week, in which Kenny, Mikey, and The Miz won when Kenny pinned Slater. Kenny and Mikey unsuccessfully challenged Slater and Rhyno for the WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship on October 25. They appeared throughout November in tag team matches, before disappearing off television.\n\nOn July 24, 2019, it was announced that Squad members Dykstra amd Mike Mondo were now signed to Major League Wrestling (MLW). They would go on to debut at that month's \"Never Say Never\" show.\n\nDoane appeared on \"Seducing Cindy\", a Fox Reality series that follows Cindy Margolis, once the most downloaded woman on the Internet, as she searches for a new love. The program premiered on January 30, 2010. Doane made it to the final five, one episode away from the season finale, but was eliminated.\n\nIn 2013, while rehabbing a knee injury, Doane penned his first children's book entitled \"Billy's Bully\". The book was released in June 2013.\n\nDoane was born to Ken and Vickie Doane in Southbridge, Massachusetts. His parents were supportive of his decision in becoming a professional wrestler. He has an older brother named Mike. Doane attended Bay Path Regional Vocational Technical High School in Charlton, Massachusetts.\n\nDoane was formerly engaged to fellow professional wrestler Mickie James.\n\nIn 2012, Doane enrolled in Nichols College where he started playing football. He plays as a tight end and linebacker.\n\n\n Kenny defended the championship with either Johnny, Mitch, Nicky, or Mikey under the Freebird Rule.\n"}

This genus contains the largest of all the phaeophyceae or brown algae. \"Macrocystis\" has pneumatocysts at the base of its blades. Sporophytes are perennial and the individual may live for up to three years; stipes/fronds within a whole individual undergo senescence, where each frond may persist for approximately 100 days. The genus is found widely in subtropical, temperate, and sub-Antarctic oceans of the Southern Hemisphere (e.g. Chile, New Zealand, Australia, Falkland Islands, Auckland Islands, etc.) and in the northeast Pacific from Baja California to Sitka, Alaska. \"Macrocystis\" is often a major component of temperate kelp forests.\n\n\"Macrocystis\" is a monospecific genus, the sole species is \"M. pyrifera\". Some individuals are so huge that the thallus may grow to up to 60 m (200 ft). The stipes arise from a holdfast and branch three or four times from near the base. Blades develop at irregular intervals along the stipe. \"M. pyrifera\" grows to over 45 m (150 ft) long. The stipes are unbranched and each blade has a gas bladder at its base.\n\nThe macroscopic sporophyte has many specialized blades growing near the holdfast. These blades bear various sori containing sporangia, which release haploid spores, which will grow into microscopic female and male gametophytes. These gametophytes, after reaching the appropriate substrata, grow mitotically to eventually produce gametes.\n\nFemales release their eggs (oogonia) along with a pheromone, the lamoxirene. This compound triggers sperm release by males. The \"Macrocystis\" sperm consists of biflagellate non-synthetic antherozoids, which find their way to the oogonia following the lamoxirene. The egg is then fertilized to form the zygote, which, through mitosis, begins growth.\n\nJuvenile giant kelp grow directly on the parent female gametophyte, extending one or two primary blades, and beginning a rudimentary holdfast, which will eventually cover the gametophyte completely. Growth occurs with lengthening of the stipe, and splitting of the blades. This occurs by means of small tears where the blade meets the stipe, which splits the stipe into two. Pneumatocysts grow after the first few blade splittings.\n\n\"Macrocystis\" typically grow forming extensive beds, large \"floating canopies\", on rocky substrata between the low intertidal. It was harvested by barges which used large blades to harvest up to 300 tons a day along the coast of California.\n\nInitially, 17 species were described within the genus \"Macrocystis\". In 1874, Hooker, following blade morphology, put them all under the same taxon, \"Macrocystis pyrifera\". In modern times, the large number of species were re-classified based on the holdfast morphology, which distinguished three species (\"M. angustifolia\", \"M. integrifolia\", and \"M. pyrifera\") and on blade morphology, which added a fourth species (\"M. laevis\") in 1986. In 2009 and 2010, however, two studies that used both morphological and molecular assessments demonstrate that \"Macrocystis\" is monospecific (as \"M. pyrifera\"), which is currently accepted by the phycological community\n\n\"Macrocystis\" is distributed along the eastern Pacific coast from Alaska to Mexico and from Peru and along the Argentinian coast as well as in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and most sub-Antarctic islands to 60°S.\n\nAlthough \"Macrocystis\" is a monospecific genus, some split \"M. pyrifera\" into the four morphs, or sub-species, described below:\n\n\n\n"}

It has a population of more than 47,374 inhabitants as per the .\n\nThe initial settlement on the shore of the Paraná was called Puerto de Piedras. The town was founded by the initiative of some businessmen from nearby Rosario, after receiving authorization from the government of Santa Fe. The area was strategically important because it was adequate for a port and next to the Arroyo del Medio, which is the natural border with the Buenos Aires Province. The residents of Puerto de Piedras attended the foundation of the new town, with the presence of governor Juan Pablo López, on 14 February 1858. The name Villa Constitución was given to the town to honor the Assembly that had promulgated the Constitution of 1852.\n\nThe town started to grow substantially with the arrival of the railroad in 1888–1890 (the station at the junction of the line coming from the port with the Buenos Aires–Rosario railway gave rise to the town of Empalme Villa Constitución).

However, Cheyenne viewers were still able to view the full schedules of all the three major networks via cable–then as now, all but essential for acceptable television in much of this market. The Denver stations have been available on cable since cable arrived in the area in the mid-1950s.\n\nIn 1972, the McCrackens were forced to break up their media empire due to an FCC rule that barred one person from owning the sole newspaper, radio station and television station in a city. They sold their television stations to Wyneco Communications, owned by Toledo-based attorney Edward Lamb, which changed the call letters of the flagship station to KYCU-TV. The new owners switched the primary affiliation to CBS.\n\nHowever, on July 11, 1976, it switched its primary affiliation to ABC and dropped all NBC programming. KEVN-TV signed on in Rapid City that day as a full-time ABC affiliate, and KYCU/KSTF felt obliged to fill the ABC void in Scottsbluff, as KOTA-TV in Rapid City and its Scottsbluff satellite, KDUH-TV (now KNEP), were primary NBC affiliates with a secondary CBS affiliation. Wyneco sold the station to Burke Broadcasting in 1983. When KOTA/KDUH switched to ABC in June 1984, KYCU/KSTF switched its affiliation to CBS primary, NBC and ABC secondary.\n\nBurke Broadcasting sold KYCU to Stauffer Communications in 1986, who changed its call sign to the current KGWN-TV on New Year's Day 1987. The station began phasing out NBC programming in the early-1980s, dropping the network entirely in 1987 when KKTU (now KQCK) signed-on as a satellite of KTWO-TV in Casper. ABC programming disappeared from the schedule by 1988. When Stauffer merged with Morris Communications in 1996, KGWN and most of the rest of Stauffer's television holdings went to Benedek Broadcasting. That company went bankrupt in 2001 (it merged with Gray Television a year later) and KGWN was sold to Chelsey Broadcasting. In 2003, the station was acquired by SagamoreHill Broadcasting.\n\nAfter having been dropped from the cable system in Northern Colorado by the time KCNC-TV became a CBS owned-and-operated station in 1995, KGWN took action to entice cable systems to carry the station in 2005. The station had talk to Comcast about getting on its Northern Colorado system in early 2005 to no avail. KGWN was talking in August to Colorado Eagles hockey team owner about broadcasting their games. By October, the station had opened a bureau in Fort Collins with two sale representatives and a reporter. US Cable agreed to carry the station beginning on November 1. The Eagles team and the station agreed to its first carriage deal for a single playoff game with the Oklahoma City Blazers on April 2, 2006, which was broadcast via Channel 5's Cheyenne transmitter. In 2005, KGWN established a Northern Colorado Bureau in Fort Collins, which produced its first newscast in June 2006. This provided another source of local news coverage in the area besides stations based in Denver. In early March 2007, the station filed a case with the FCC to have the local market changed to included Larimer and Weld counties. As prior to cable's dominance in the mid-1990s, the station served the area and has made other current moves to serve the area. Comcast finally caved and added KGWN on three systems. In June 2008, the station suspended its Northern Colorado operations only to restarted them on September 15, 2008.\nOn September 15, 2008, this operation was expanded after KGWN-DT2 launched a weeknight 35 minute newscast in partnership with the Independent News Network (INN). Known as \"Northern Colorado 5 News at 10\", the broadcast was recorded in advance from INN's production facility on Tremont Avenue in Davenport, Iowa. The news anchor, meteorologist, and sports anchor were provided by the centralized news operation and other personnel from INN filled-in as necessary. By September 2008, KGWN began broadcasting a separate CBS feed, identified as Northern Colorado 5 or NoCo 5 in short, on its second digital subchannel that specifically focused on Northern Colorado. Although Northern Colorado is part of the Denver market, KGWN has long claimed Northern Colorado as part of its primary coverage area, since its transmitter is close to the Colorado border. It provides city-grade coverage of Fort Collins, Loveland, and Greeley. It also provides grade B coverage as far south as Longmont and Boulder. It has long been carried on cable systems in Fort Collins, Loveland, and Greeley alongside Denver's CBS affiliate (originally KMGH-TV and now network owned-and-operated KCNC-TV). Additionally, many cable systems in Wyoming, particularly on the Wyoming side of the Denver market, carry both KGWN and KCNC.\n\nAt some point in time, production of \"Northern Colorado 5 News at 10\" moved to a secondary set at KGWN's studios in Cheyenne and was no longer outsourced to the Independent News Network. Although the program was still taped in advance, it now featured anchor personnel from KGWN while three reporters based locally in Fort Collins contributed Northern Colorado-specific content to the broadcast. In addition, there were weekday morning local weather cut-ins during \"CBS This Morning\" that were taped at KGWN's facility but with a focus on Northern Colorado. Weekday mornings from 6 to 6:30, KGWN-DT2 simulcast local radio station KXBG (97.9 FM). Following at 6:30, there was a local weather forecast segment which repeats several times during the half-hour. The Colorado-focused station did not simulcast any newscasts from its parent station. \"Northern Colorado 5\" was discontinued on December 19, 2013.\n\nOn September 18, 2006, KGWN began carrying programming from The CW on a new second digital subchannel. This was dropped in September 2008 in favor of a standard definition simulcast of the main signal targeted towards Northern Colorado. The CW programming continued to be seen on area cable systems. On April 29, 2009, the carriage contract of KGWN and \"Cheyenne CW\" expired. This led to SagamoreHill Broadcasting demanding that Bresnan Cable remove the two channels, resulting in approximately 30,000 customers (reported as 80% of their viewership) losing access to local CBS and CW programming. The dispute hinged on the amount SagamoreHill wanted to charge Bresnan for the rights to carry the stations.\n\nKGWN waged a propaganda campaign in the days leading up to the end of the contract attempting to change Bresnan Cable customers to Dish Network. KGWN refused to post any comments on its site regarding customers who did not wish to see the contract renewed despite news coverage of the dispute having elicited numerous such comments. On May 8, 2009, the stations were restored to the Bresnan system. In December 2011, CW programming was added to subchannel 5.3 and NOCO 5 programming on subchannel 5.2 was improved to 720p.\n\nIn May 2013, SagamoreHill Broadcasting reached a deal to sell KGWN and KSTF, along with KGNS-TV in Laredo, Texas, to Yellowstone Holdings, a subsidiary of Frontier Radio Management. On November 4, 2013, Gray Television announced a deal to acquire Yellowstone Holdings for $23 million. That reunited KGWN with many of its former sister stations under Benedek ownership after being separated for 11 years. KGWN-TV was operated under a local marketing agreement by Gray until the closure of the deal, on December 31. On December 19, 2013, KGWN announced that it would close \"Northern Colorado 5,\" citing the inability to make the service \"a viable long-term operation.\"\n\nOn January 24, 2019, Gray announced that the news operations of KGWN-TV and KCWY-DT would be merged under the \"Wyoming News Now\" banner by April 9, a banner similar to those used by some sister stations that were acquired from Raycom Media earlier in 2019. Under this arrangement, KGWN's 5:30 p.m. newscast will be the only Cheyenne-specific newscast (with KCWY airing a Casper-only newscast at 5 p.m.); all other newscasts, while being produced at KGWN, will be simulcast on KCWY in Casper and cover both markets. The consolidation came after the Department of Justice (DOJ) blocked Gray's acquisition of the CBS affiliation of Casper's KGWC-TV, which would have given Gray a second revenue stream in that market to cover KCWY's financial losses.\nThe stations' digital signals are multiplexed:\nKGWN turned of its analog signal on channel 5 (VHF), and transitioned to a digital on UHF 30 on the mandatory June 12th, 2009 conversion date at 3PM local time.\nKGWN's semi-satellite KSTF did not offer any subchannels until upgrades to the microwave link connecting the stations were made in the mid-2010s; additionally, as the link used analog equipment, KSTF could only broadcast in standard definition. However, KGWN's high definition feed was carried in Scottsbluff on Charter digital channel 785. , KSTF broadcasts in high definition and carries the KGWN subchannels.\n\nBy March 2020, the KGWN-DT3 feed of Cheyenne CW had been upgraded into 720p HD over-the-air; it had been airing in the standard definition picture format, before then; however, the KSTF-DT3 feed of Cheyenne CW continues to be aired in the 480i 4:3 picture format. Meanwhile, the KGWN feed of CBS had been upgraded into 1080i full HD over-the-air; it had been airing in the 720p HD picture format, before then, as the KSTF feed of CBS continues to be.\n\nKGWN presently broadcasts 20 hours and 55 minutes of newscasts (3 hours and 35 minutes on Weekdays, 1 1/2 hours on Weekends) per week, 17 hours and 25 minutes of which is new programming (The newscast at 1:10 am is always a repeat), while just 3 hours and 30 minutes per week are local.\n\nAdditionally, KGWN produces 17 hours of newscasts (3 hours on weekdays and 1 hour on weekends) per week for sister station KCWY in Casper under the \"Wyoming News Now\" banner. Both KGWN and KCHY produces a half hour broadcast that is also under the \"News Now\" banner, but replaces the local city with \"Wyoming\" (e.g. \"Casper News Now\" and \"Cheyenne News Now\"). Although technically separate, they are also both ran by Grey Television.\nThe weekday morning edition (alongside the noon edition) of \"Wyoming News Now\" is the first newscast in the state of Wyoming to include a \"time and temperature\" box alongside with a lower display line (The LDL was borrowed from KCWY, however they didn't have the time and temperature box). \n\nKSTF signed-on August 7, 1955 as a semi-satellite of what was then KFBC-TV. In 1958, KOTA-TV in Rapid City, South Dakota put its own satellite station on-the-air in Scottsbluff, KDUH-TV (now KNEP). During the next twelve years, there was a great amount of confusion among Scottsbluff viewers especially when the two stations aired the same program simultaneously. Both had unusual \"joint primary\" affiliations with ABC and CBS from 1965 onwards. Although KFBC/KSTF slightly favored ABC and KOTA/KDUH slightly favored CBS, it did not help the duplication problem. However, in 1970, KDUH, along with KOTA, dropped CBS for NBC.\n\nOn December 28, 1963, KTVS in Sterling, Colorado signed-on as another semi-satellite serving Northeastern Colorado. In September 1999, Benedek sold that station to the Newsweb Corporation which made it a satellite of Denver's KTVD. In 2000, Benedek ended most local operations at KGWC-TV in Casper and its two satellites: KGWR-TV (in Rock Springs) and KGWL-TV (in Lander). The three stations became semi-satellites of KGWN. In 2003, Chelsey Broadcasting agreed to sell all three to Mark III Media (a group that included former KTWO-TV General Manager Mark Nalbone). After the FCC dismissed several objections to the sale, Mark III consummated the agreement to buy the stations on May 31, 2006.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2261473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2261473", "title": "Bleib bei uns, denn es will Abend werden, BWV 6", "text": "Bleib bei uns, denn es will Abend werden, BWV 6\n\nThe prescribed readings for the feast day were Peter's sermon from the Acts of the Apostles, and the Road to Emmaus narration from the Gospel of Luke. The text by an anonymous librettist begins with a line from the gospel, and includes as the third movement two stanzas from Philipp Melanchthon's hymn \"\" and its second stanza by Nikolaus Selnecker. The text ends with the second stanza of Martin Luther's hymn \"\". Derived from the gospel scene, the topic is pleading for light in a situation of threatening darkness.\n\nBach structured the cantata in six movements and scored it for four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of oboes, strings and continuo. The extended opening chorus is formed like a French overture and has been compared to \"Ruht wohl, ihr heiligen Gebeine\", the last chorus of Bach's \"St John Passion\".\nIn 1723, Bach was appointed as \"Thomaskantor\" (director of church music) in Leipzig, where he was responsible for the music at four churches and for the training and education of boys singing in the \"Thomanerchor\". He took office in the middle of the liturgical year, on the first Sunday after Trinity. In his first twelve months in office, Bach decided to compose new works for almost all liturgical events, known as his first cantata cycle. The year after, he continued that effort, composing chorale cantatas based on Lutheran hymns. He kept the format of the chorale cantata cycle until Palm Sunday of 1725, but then repeated an early Easter cantata, \"Christ lag in Todes Banden\", BWV 4, on Easter Sunday, and wrote \"Bleib bei uns, denn es will Abend werden\" for Second Day of Easter as the first cantata in that cycle that was not a chorale cantata. The change was possibly due to the loss of a librettist.\n\nThe prescribed readings for the feast day were from the Acts of the Apostles, the sermon of Peter (), and from the Gospel of Luke, the Road to Emmaus (). Bach used a text by an anonymous poet who had already supplied librettos for his first cycle. The poet took verse 29 from the Gospel of Luke as a starting point: the two disciples ask the stranger whom they met on their way to stay with them, as darkness is about to fall. The situation represents the position of the Christian in general. The librettist chose two stanzas from \"\" for the third movement, one written by Philipp Melanchthon as a German version of \"\", and of similar content as the first movement, and the other the hymn's second stanza which was added by Nikolaus Selnecker. The closing chorale is the second stanza of Martin Luther's hymn \"\" (Maintain us, Lord, within thy word). The text, of rather dry and didactic quality, is focused on the contrast between light and dark, viewing Jesus as the light of a sinful world.\n\nBach first performed the cantata on 2 April 1725.\n\nBach structured the cantata in six movements. The first and last are set for choir, while the inner movements are set for soloists, in a sequence of aria – chorale – recitative – aria. Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble: two oboes (Ob), oboe da caccia (Oc), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), violoncello piccolo (Vp) and basso continuo (Bc). The duration of the piece has been stated as 26 minutes.\n\nIn the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from the book by Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The instruments are shown separately for winds and strings, while the continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.\n\nThe cantata opens with \"\" (Abide with us; for it is toward evening), a large-scale tripartite chorus, reminiscent of a slow sarabande or of the closing \"Ruht wohl, ihr heiligen Gebeine\" of the \"St John Passion\". The instruments, a choir of three oboes and strings, present a theme which Dürr describes as \"of speech-like gestures\". It is picked up by the voices, first in homophony. The vocal lines in this movement descend on \"\" (for evening is nigh) \"as if the gloom of night were weighing upon them\". While the beginning of the movement has no tempo marking, the middle section is marked \"Andante\" and in Alla-breve time, suggesting a faster pace. The voices, accompanied first only by the continuo, perform a fugue on two subjects at the same time: \"denn es will Abend werden\" (for it is toward evening) and \"und der Tag hat sich geneiget\" (and the day is far spent). A third motif, long notes on the same pitch, illustrates the \"abiding\" or staying. The movement is closed by a shortened reprise of the beginning. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann compares the slow-fast-slow structure of the movement to the French overture and notes that it opens a new series of cantatas. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, notes the similarity to the last chorus \"Ruht wohl\" from Bach's \"St John Passion\", describing the cantata's \"tender pleadings which become ever more gestural and urgent for enlightenment in a darkening world from which Jesus' presence has been removed.\"\n\nThe second movement, \"\" (Highly praised Son of God), is a da capo aria for the alto, accompanied by an obbligato oboe da caccia, which was replaced by viola in later performances. Dürr describes the choice of voice and obbligato in the same range as unusual and \"of special charme\". The opening phrase is illustrated by an upward line, while the mention of falling darkness is interpreted by downward whole-tone steps.\n\nThe third movement, \"\" (Ah remain with us, Lord Jesus Christ), is a setting of the chorale with a virtuoso part for violincello piccolo. This movement was later adapted as one of the Schübler Chorales, BWV 649.\n\nThe only recitative is for bass, \"\" (The darkness has taken over in many places). Its \"threatening chromatic bass line\" reminds the listeners of \"the gravity of the situation\".\n\nThe last aria, \"\" (Jesus, let us look upon You), is for tenor with string accompaniment. It is characterised by a persistent walking rhythm, somewhat mitigated by the flowing triplets in the violin line. Hofmann notes that the lively violin figures illustrate from the start the text about the \"light of the Word of God shining more brightly\", which appears only in the second part.\n\nThe four-part closing chorale, \"\" (Reveal Your strength, Lord Jesus Christ,), chorale is \"quarried very little for musical building blocks\", according to Julian Mincham, ending the work on a sombre tone.\n\nThe selection is taken from the listing on the Bach Cantatas Website. Instrumental groups playing period instruments in historically informed performances are highlighted green under the header \"\".\n\n"}

In this sense, wellerisms that include proverbs are a type of anti-proverb. Typically a wellerism consists of three parts: a proverb or saying, a speaker, and an often humorously literal explanation.\nSam Weller's propensity to use the types of constructions now called \"wellerisms\" has inspired plays; sometimes, the playwrights have created even more wellerisms.\n\nA type of wellerism called a Tom Swifty incorporates a speaker attribution that puns on the quoted statement.\n\n\n\nSome researchers concentrate on wellerisms found in English and European languages, but Alan Dundes documented them in the Yoruba language of Nigeria (Dundes 1964), with African scholars confirming and adding to his findings (Ojoade 1980, Opata 1988, 1990). Wellerisms are also common in many Ethiopian languages, including Guji Oromo, (where nine of 310 proverbs in a published collection are wellerisms) and Alaaba (where about 10% of 418 proverbs were found to be quotations). They are also found in ancient Sumerian: \"The fox, having urinated into the sea, said: 'The depths of the sea are my urine!'\"\n\nDutch:\n\nHebrew:\nRussian:\n\nAntillean Creole French, Martinique:\n\nSumerian\n\nWellerism proverbs have been documented across Africa, Europe, western and southern Asia, but in almost no languages of eastern Asia.\n\nIn a number of languages, especially in Africa, wellerisms are formed with animals as the speaker. In some cases, the choice of the animal may not carry much significance. However, in some cases, such as in the Chumburung language of Ghana, the choice of the specific animal as speaker is a significant part of some proverbs, \"chosen precisely for characteristics that illustrate the proverb... \"Chameleon says quickly quickly is good and slowly slowly is good.\"\" Similarly, there is an Ewe proverb that quotes an animal that is specifically appropriate to that wellerism, \"The chicken says that, it is because of humility that he bows down before entering its coop.\" Another example of a speaker being specifically chosen to go with the statement in a wellerism is \"The bat says that there is no difference between standing down and upright\", from the Tiv language in Nigeria.\n\nWellerisms are similar but not identical to dialogue proverbs. Wellerisms contain the speech of one speaker, but dialogue proverbs contain direct speech from more than one. They are found in a number of languages, including Armenian, French, Georgian, Kasena of Ghana, and Pashto of Afghanistan and Pakistan. \n\n\n\n"}

The first meeting of the club took place on 12 March 1959. Sixty people attended the meeting and donated a shilling each, meaning the club made IR£3.30 on the night. The club decided to use green and white jerseys, but they later decided to use the gold and purple colours, some say because of the local school Scoil Lorcain Naofa who also use gold and purple, others say it was because blue are the colours of the crocus.\n\nIn 1963 the club purchased a six and a half acre site behind the Ormonde Cinema as a permanent home pitch for themselves, Páirc de Burca, and in 1965 the adjoining Glenalbyn House was bought. In April 1966, Crokes hurling club joined up with Kilmacud football club. The name of the joint football/hurling teams was changed from Kilmacud G.A.A. club to Kilmacud Crokes G.A.A. club in 1971. In 1972, St. Benburbs Football Club of Clonskeagh joined with Kilmacud Crokes. St. Benburbs FC was famous because the first ever All-Ireland Final was played on their ground in Clonskeagh in 1887. In 1973, a camogie section of the club was set up and in February 1996 a Ladies' Gaelic football Section was set up.\n\nThe club has installed an astro-turf GAA pitch at \"the paddock\", an area formerly used as a carpark/training ground, a venture which was finished in September 2006, and constructed indoor and outdoor hurling walls during 2007.\n\nThe current football Senior team is managed by Robbie Brennan and Johnny Magee.\nAnthony Daly is the current hurling coach.\n\nKilmacud Crokes are also famous as the hosts of the \"Sevens\" football and hurling competitions each year. Separate competitions are held on the weekends of the various All-Ireland Finals in September. For example, the Football competition is held on the Saturday before the All-Ireland Football final and the Hurling competition is held on the Saturday before the All-Ireland Hurling final. The Sevens were first played in 1973 and have since become an integral part of the All-Ireland weekends and feature on sports news programmes. Famous players and officials from the GAA are normally present on the day. Discussions and previews of the All-Ireland final on the following day are the subject of a lot of the media broadcasts.\n\nThe competitions run from the morning through to the evening. The games are played at various locations in and around Stillorgan including \"Glenalbyn\", \"Deer Park\", \"St Benildus College\", \"St Olaf's\" and \"Silverpark\". The finals are always played in Glenalbyn. The games are played with teams of seven players with two-halves of ten minutes each. Erin's Own of Cork and Castlewellan of Down were crowned Hurling and Football Sevens Champions for 2006 respectively. Longstone of Down won the 2007 football competition.\n\nKilmacud Crokes won the All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship final on St. Patrick's Day, 1995 under the management of Tommy Lyons. Kilmacud Crokes, captained by Mick Dillon, beat Bellaghy of Derry with a scoreline of 0–8 to 0–5 in front of 18,544 fans at Croke Park. Mick Pender famously saved Damian Cassidy's (Bellaghy) penalty and won the title for Kilmacud. The game will be remembered as one of the coldest days club football final history.\n\nAnother county title followed in 1998. Crokes beat Na Fianna in the final. Wins over James Stephens, Kilkenny and Stradbally, Laois set up one of the most memorable Leinster club finals in recent years. Crokes played three games against Éire Óg, Carlow; they eventually lost however.\n\nCrokes won the Dublin championship in 2004. Crokes were nearly disqualified from the 2005 championship due to confusion over the eligibility of player Mark Vaughan. Crokes had defeated 2003 champions, St. Brigids, it was claimed that Mark Vaughan was ineligible for the tie. Crokes claimed that they had received prior approval that Vaughan could play from the Dublin county board, who said the \"Dublin Championships\" and \"The Leinster Championships\" were different competitions. The Leinster council overruled the Dublin county board. St. Brigids offered Crokes a replay under one condition, that Vaughan could not play. He scored six points in Crokes' original one-point victory over Brigids. He had received the red card that caused the ban in the previous years defeat to Portlaoise. The DRA eventually awarded Crokes the match after agreeing that the two competitions were different. By this time Crokes' side of the draw was three games behind the other side of the draw. Kilmacud went on to win the 2005 Dublin Championship following a comprehensive 1–14 to 0–09 victory over Na Fianna and added to their success by winning the Leinster Championship following a 0–10 to 0–09 victory over Newbridge at Navan. Crokes were defeated in the All-Ireland semi-final by Salthill-Knocknacarra on a scoreline of 1–09 to 1–07. Mark Vaughan was shown a straight red card, having already been on a yellow, for striking a Salthill player. In 2006 and 2007, Crokes narrowly lost out in the semi-final stage of the Dublin championship. They lost to UCD and St Vincents, respectively. On 27 October 2008, Kilmacud won their sixth Dublin Senior Football Championship at Parnell Park. On 7 December 2008 kilmacud won the Leinster Senior Football Championship for the third time, beating Rhode of Offaly by a scoreline of 2–07 to 1–07. They ensured their place in the All-Ireland final with a two-goal victory over Corofin of Galway on 21 February, and eventually defeated Crossmaglen Rangers of Armagh to win the final. Kilmacud also went on to win the Dublin Senior Championship with a victory over St. Brigids in 2010, before bowing out in the All-Ireland series to Crossmaglen Rangers at the semi-final stage.\n\nKilmacud Crokes has won the All-Ireland Football Féile final three times, the first of these coming in 2003, the second in 2008 and the third in 2019. The hurlers added to the club's success with an All-Ireland Hurling Féile of their own in 2005. This hurling victory was the first time in the club's history that they had won the Dublin Hurling Féile and only the second time a Dublin Club had won the All-Ireland Féile. In 2014 the hurlers won Dublin and All-Ireland Hurling Féile titles.\n\nIn 2008 the U-14A hurling team again reached the All-Ireland Féile group stages, but after a tough match in the pouring rain they lost to James Stephens from Kilkenny. The U-14A footballers enjoyed more success and emerged victorious as All-Ireland Winners in Cavan in July. The ladies U-14 team also made it to their final also in Cavan, only to be beaten in the end by Naomh Michael.\n\nA full table of results is available here: Football Feile 2008 Results\n\nKilmacud Crokes won the Dublin Minor Hurling Championship final in 2007. They won the title for the third time in the club's history when they beat Na Fianna in a replay. The manager of the team was former Tipperary player, Richard Stakelum.

{"id": "2261480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2261480", "title": "Met English", "text": "Met English\n\nMet English Language (MEL) was an early computer language used by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife). It enabled MetLife to establish itself as a strong technology company in the early days of commercial computing. It has now been retired and is no longer in use.\n\nMet English was a Cobol-like language. Two of its most peculiar characteristics were bytes and fields of variable \"bitness\" or length in bits, and the use of self-modifying code (conditional branches were implemented by modifying the target address of branch instructions in memory). The language was very rich in mathematical functions, especially those useful to the insurance industry. It was verbose with syntax like \"ADD (A FIELDA) TO (B FIELDB) PUTTING RESULT INTO (ANSWER)\".\n\nMet English was used to write some of the most complex business systems at MetLife in the 1950s and 1960s. It remained the primary language used by MetLife in the 1970s, but was gradually phased out after the company standardized on IBM hardware and software in the mid-1980s. Met English systems continued to run in the company (with a new ELCA2 compiler that generated IBM assembler language) until after 2000. Large amounts of MEL code were retired as part of the preparation for Y2K.\n\nThe UNIVAC English Language compiler was the first one produced at MetLife, in 1959. (Other sources indicate 1957.) Its chief value was in the experience gained in the use of the language and in implementing the compiler program. This initial effort made the later H-800 compilers more efficient by allowing improvement attributable to hindsight. The UNIVAC Compiler was used as late as 1964.\n\nThe Compromise English Language Compiler compiled on UNIVAC II but produced H-800 coding. This approach allowed MetLife to have a compiling system in existence for the H-800 almost as soon as the machines were installed. All production work on the Honeywell systems was processed through the Compromise Compiler until the summer of 1963.\n\nThe Hybrid Compiler was an interim device midway between the Compromise and the H-800 Compilers. The first half of the compilation was done on the H-800 computer using completed sections of the H-800 Compiler; the remainder was done on the Compromise Compiler. Advantages were conservation of machine time, better diagnostics and some liberalizing of the language rules.\n\nThe H-800 compiler, also known as HLOC, ran exclusively on the Honeywell System. Its usage became standard practice in 1964. It made possible additional language facilities.\n\nThe ELCA compiler gradually replaced HLOC during the years 1975-1977. It ran faster and generated better code and incorporated many useful language extensions. It had the option to generate assembly language (GMAP) which could be processed on Honeywell Series 66 machines.\n\nIn the 1980s MetLife \"migrated\" Met English programs from Honeywell hardware to IBM. (IBM hardware had been in use for COBOL programs for some time.) The Emulator read Honeywell machine code and interpreted each instruction on an MVS system. Some emulated programs were quite slow and this was not pursued as a long term solution.\n\nMetLife developed a new compiler that generated IBM assembler code. The standard IBM assembler generated machine code from that. Versions of this compiler were used until the language was retired.\n"}
{"id": "2261482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2261482", "title": "Good News (musical)", "text": "Good News (musical)\n\nGood News is a musical with a book by Laurence Schwab and B.G. DeSylva, lyrics by DeSylva and Lew Brown, and music by Ray Henderson. The story is set in the Roaring Twenties at Tait College, where football star Tom Marlowe falls in love with studious Connie Lane, who is tutoring him so he can pass astronomy and be eligible to play in the big game.\n\nThe show opened on Broadway in 1927, the same year as \"Show Boat\", but though its plot was decidedly old-fashioned in comparison to \"Show Boat\"'s daring storyline, it was also a hit. \"Good News\" spawned two films, one in 1930, starring Bessie Love and one in 1947 starring June Allyson; an unsuccessful 1974 Broadway revival, and a 1993 updated production by Music Theatre of Wichita, which created a largely new libretto and made changes to the score. It proved to be DeSylva, Brown, and Henderson's biggest hit out of a string of topical musicals.\n\nThe original Broadway production, directed by Edgar MacGregor and choreographed by Bobby Connolly, opened on September 6, 1927 at The 46th Street Theatre, where it ran for 557 performances, which was a very successful run, as few Broadway shows had reached 500 performances since 1919's \"Irene\". The cast included John Price Jones as Tom Marlowe, Mary Lawlor as Connie Lane, Gus Shy as Bobby Randall, Inez Courtney as Babe O'Day, and Zelma O'Neal as Flo. Donald Oenslager designed the production's sets. To emphasize the collegiate atmosphere, ushers wore jerseys, and George Olsen's band (featured as the \"College Band\") reached the orchestra pit by running down the aisles as they shouted college cheers. University of Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne received credit for \"Advice in Football Technique\". The musical was set in what was then the present day, the Roaring Twenties, and, according to musical theatre historian Gerald Bordman, it was clearly a reflection of that era: \"The decade's jazzy sounds, its assertive, explosive beat, its sophomoric high jinks were joyously mirrored...\" The plot hinged on a professor's unexpected generosity: Tom fails Professor Charles Kenyon's astronomy class, and, even though Connie tutors him, he still fails his makeup exam. Professor Kenyon gives him a passing grade, though, because he, unbeknownst to the students, is actually a football fan.\n\nIn the 1970s, producer Harry Rigby started the Broadway nostalgia craze with his revivals of \"No, No, Nanette\" and \"Irene\". He decided that \"Good News\" would be his next project. Rigby planned to feature former movie musical stars in \"Good News\", as he had in \"No, No, Nanette\" and \"Irene\". John Payne was cast as the football coach, and Alice Faye was cast as the (now female) astronomy professor, who was renamed Professor Charlotte Kenyon. The book was rewritten to create a romance between their characters, reducing the impact of the college student characters who had made the 1927 version popular. Because Rigby had already produced \"No, No, Nanette\", a revival set in the 1920s, he moved the setting of \"Good News\" to the Depression-era Thirties. During the development of the revival, the score was also altered; some songs from the original 1927 production were removed, while six songs from other Ray Henderson scores were interpolated. Abe Burrows was hired as director and adapter, and Donald Saddler was hired as choreographer; however, during the development of the revival, they were replaced by Michael Kidd as director/choreographer and Garry Marshall as adapter. A few weeks before the Broadway opening, John Payne, whose contract had run out, was replaced by Gene Nelson. After a try-out in Boston, a nationwide tour for almost a year, and 51 previews, a lavish production opened on Broadway on December 23, 1974 at the St. James Theatre where, having failed to charm the critics as its predecessor had, it ran for only 16 regular performances. Saddler was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography.\n\nIn 1993, Mark Madama and Wayne Bryan (who had played the role of Bobby Randall in the 1974 production) revised the book and score for Music Theatre of Wichita. They retained some of the plot elements and score additions from the 1974 production, including the romance between the (female) astronomy professor and football coach, but they returned the story to the 1920s, added back more of the 1927 score, and recentered the book so its main focus was the college students. They also altered the story so Tom, because of Connie's tutoring, passes the test on his own accord without any undeserved help from Professor Kenyon. The production starred Michael Gruber, Kim Huber, Ann Morrison and Scott Schafer. This version has now been licensed for over 400 professional and amateur productions in the United Stages, Canada, and England. A studio cast recording of this adaptation was released in 1995, performed by many members of the 1993 cast, but with Wayne Bryan returning to the role of Bobby.\n\nMGM released two film versions, the first in 1930 with Bessie Love and Cliff Edwards and the second in 1947 with June Allyson and Peter Lawford. \"The Railroad Hour\" broadcast a 45-minute condensed version as its first episode on October 4, 1948.\n\n\nWorld War I is over, the Roaring Twenties have arrived, and college campuses, such as fictional Tait College, are as much a social scene as an academic one (\"Opening Chorus\"). Football star Tom Marlowe neglects his studies and fails his astronomy class, which he had to pass to play in the big game. Charles Kenyon, his astronomy professor, gives Tom one more chance to pass the exam.\n\nBabe O'Day, a vivacious flapper, announces that she has broken up with Beef Saunders, a brawny and possessive football player. Babe wants a new boyfriend who doesn't care about old-fashioned rules of propriety (\"Flaming Youth\"). Tom asks his girlfriend Patricia, to help him study for the test, but she is busy with sorority plans, so she recommends that he work with her studious cousin, Connie Lane. The boys marvel that Tom is remaining cheerful despite his circumstances, and Tom explains that college is the time for \"Happy Days\". Connie has a crush on Tom, but she says that she will \"Just Imagine\" that he's in love with her. Babe informs Bobby Randall, substitute player on the football team and Tom's roommate, that he is now her boyfriend. Connie and Tom meet to study and are initially uncomfortable working together, but soon they find they have a lot in common and similar philosophies of life (\"The Best Things In Life Are Free\").\n\nFriday morning, Tom and Bobby wake up in their dormitory, and Tom leaves to meet Connie to study. A door-slamming farce follows during which Babe, Beef, Kearney (the football team's trainer), and Sylvester, a freshman who idolizes Tom, all end up in Tom and Bobby's dorm room, and Bobby must keep the men from finding out that Babe is there.\n\nCouples walk together \"On the Campus.\" Flo, an outspoken, energetic girl, leads the students in dancing the \"Varsity Drag\". Bobby tries to tell Babe he loves her but says he's too nervous to say it (\"Baby! What?\").\n\nTom takes his exam, but he later admits to Connie that during the test, he couldn't focus on astronomy; he was thinking about her. Tom declares that with Connie, he's \"Lucky in Love.\" Professor Kenyon grades Tom's test and knows that Tom deserves a failing grade, but because Kenyon is an alumnus of Tait and a loyal football fan, he keeps that secret and instead gives Tom the lowest passing grade so he can play in the big game. At the pep rally that evening, the students sing the \"Tait Song\" as the school band plays. Bobby announces that if Tom wins the game tomorrow, Patricia has promised to marry him. During a chorus of \"Lucky in Love,\" Connie faints and falls into Tom's arms (\"Finaletto\").\n\n\nOn Saturday, Patricia's sorority, Pi Beta Phi, is hosting a luncheon (\"The Girl of the Pi Beta Phi\"). The girls are excited about the football game (\"Today's the Day\"). Babe asks Bobbie, who has been flirting with other girls, why he won't commit to her, and Bobby, who has sat on the bench all season and doesn't expect to play in the big game at all, tells her if he wins the game, he'll marry her (\"In the Meantime\"). Connie confronts Tom and tears up her ticket to the game because she doesn't want to watch him win for Patricia, and Tom tells her he'd rather lose the game. Flo says that she knows Tait is going to win and \"Good News\" must be on its way.\n\nOutside the entrance to the football field, Connie meets Professor Kenyon, who is on his way to the game. Professor Kenyon tells her the truth: Tom didn't deserve to pass the test, but to help the football team, he gave Tom the passing grade. Babe explains to Connie that Tom didn't betray her—a long time ago, after a wild party involving homemade gin, Tom wrote a letter proposing to Patricia, and Patricia has kept the letter and is holding him to it.\n\nAt the end of the first half of the game, the score is 3–0 against Tait. Coach Johnson decides to let Bobby play in the second half. When the second half is almost over, Tom gets the ball and runs for a touchdown, but he is tackled by the opposing team. He fumbles the ball, and it flies in the air and improbably lands in Bobby's arms, and Bobby scores the winning touchdown. The students leave the game celebrating the victory (\"Good News\" (reprise)). Tom tells Connie, who watched the game through a knothole in the fence surrounding the stadium, that he fumbled because he knew he couldn't win the game for Patricia. He worries that his chances of being named for the All-American team are gone, but Connie helps him remember that \"The Best Things in Life Are Free\" (reprise). He asks Connie if she'd marry him if he didn't have to marry Patricia, and she says she would. \nThat evening, a dance is held at the boathouse (\"Varsity Drag\" (reprise)). Babe tells Bobby that since neither of them expected for him to win the game, he doesn't have to marry her. Bobby says he wants to marry Babe; everyone else thinks he's a football hero, but she knows who he really is. Patricia, not wanting to marry a man who isn't really in love with her, tells Tom that he can marry Connie instead. The news spreads that Tom has been named to the All-American team. Tom and Connie meet Professor Kenyon, whom Tom resents for failing him the first time. Connie explains to Tom that Professor Kenyon passed him even though he didn't deserve it. Tom realizes he has misjudged Kenyon and shakes his hand. After a final chorus of \"Good News\", Tom and Connie embrace.\n\nTait College is still caught up in the social scene of the Roaring Twenties, and star football player Tom Marlowe is expected to lead the football team to victory (\"Good News\"). All the sorority girls are crazy about Tom (\"He's a Ladies' Man\"), but he's off limits since he is currently romancing Patricia Bingham, whose father is of one of the college's wealthiest benefactors. The football team, under the guidance of superstitious team trainer Pooch Kearney, is on the practice field getting ready for Saturday's Big Game against archrival Colton College (\"The Football Drill\"). Meanwhile, Bobby Randall, a substitute on the football team, is pleasantly shocked when Babe O'Day, a stylish flapper, pursues him. Babe has broken up with hulking Beef Saunders, her old boyfriend, and is looking for a new man (\"Button Up Your Overcoat\").\n\nSylvester (a college freshman whom no one knows the last name of) found out that Tom has neglected his studies and has failed his astronomy final, which he needed to pass in order to play in the Big Game. Astronomy professor Charlotte Kenyon agrees to give Tom one more chance with a make-up exam. Privately Professor Kenyon tells Connie Lane, a studious coed, about her lost college romance with a football player (who is now the Tait football coach), and Connie wishes she could fall in love (\"Together/My Lucky Star\"). Football Coach Johnson, meanwhile, tells his confidant Pooch that he and Professor Kenyon dated and broke up in college (\"Together\"). They ask Patricia if she would tutor Tom for his exam, but she has to choose new drapes for the sorority house that night, and recommends her cousin Connie instead. As couples stroll romantically \"On the Campus,\" Connie and Tom meet at the library to study. After an awkward beginning, Tom and Connie soon realize they have a lot in common and similar philosophies of life (\"The Best Things In Life Are Free\"). Across campus, Coach Johnson nostalgically serenades Professor Kenyon, hoping she will go easy when Tom retakes his exam. Initially charmed, she responds warmly (\"You're The Cream in my Coffee\"), but soon realizes he's trying to manipulate her and angrily sends him away.\n\nThe next morning, Tom takes his make-up exam as the students nervously await the results in the Malt Shoppe. Babe insists that they can't let school depress them and teaches everyone the latest dance, \"The Varsity Drag.\" Sylvester bursts into the Malt Shoppe shouting that Tom has passed the test, and Tom finds Connie to tell her that he couldn't have done it without her help, declaring that she has made him \"Lucky In Love.\" Babe tells Bobby she's in love with him, and even though Bobby's scared of Beef (who still considers Babe his girl), he agrees that they might be \"Lucky In Love,\" too. Patricia interrupts everyone to publicly announce that her wealthy father has announced he will double his donation to the athletic department if Tom wins the Big Game for Tait and marries Pat. Connie is shocked, and Tom is dumbstruck as the students joyously sing another chorus of \"Lucky in Love.\"\n\nIt's Saturday, and \"Today's the Day\" of the big game against Colton. Pat and the sorority girls are terribly excited, but are briefly saddened when they realize this is the last football game they will ever attend as students (\"The Girl of the Pi Beta Phi\")! Bobby stops by the sorority open house (after all, they might have sandwiches) and commits to Babe (\"Never Swat a Fly\"), but only if they win the game. The students head to the Big Game singing \"The Tait Song\" as Pat tries to pressure Tom into marrying her. Tom feels that Tait's whole athletic program is at stake, and reluctantly tells Connie he can't stay with her. Connie resigns herself to \"Just Imagine\" Tom is still there with her.\n\nThe game begins, but Tom is so upset about Connie that by halftime, Tait is far behind Colton. Pooch urges the team to \"Keep Your Sunny Side Up,\" while Professor Kenyon tries to persuade Babe and Connie that the three of them should devise a strategy to pursue their men, and help them win the game. Through their combined efforts, Bobby scores an unexpected touchdown, Tait wins the big game, Sylvester is William Randolph Hearst's nephew who knows Bobby told the paper that Tom planned the game, and the happy couples, Tom and Connie, Bobby and Babe, and Coach Johnson and Professor Kenyon, all end up together (\"Finale\").\n\n\n\nThe original 1927 Broadway production met with positive reviews. Brooks Atkinson of \"The New York Times\" pronounced it \"a ripping good show\", with an authentically collegiate atmosphere, stating, \"For once a musical play based upon undergraduate life and a football game has some resemblance to the disorderly, rhymeless scheme of things in American institutions of learning\". He deemed it \"a constantly fast entertainment with furious dancing, catchy tunes...excellent singing, and genuine excitement.\"\n\nThe 1974 production opened to mostly negative reviews. Some critics had begun to consider Rigby's revivals formulaic; Clive Barnes of \"The New York Times\" derisively pronounced \"Good News\", and shows like it, \"prefabricated...nostalgia\", and Martin Gottfried of the \"New York Post\" deemed it \"a joyless, mechanical reproduction\". The book was harshly criticized; Barnes pronounced it \"a terrible book\" with \"jokes obvious enough to give banana skins a bad name\", and \"Time\" referred to it as an \"ancient flapdoodle of a plot\". Critics also questioned the practice of interpolating songs from other shows. Walter Kerr opined that preserving the original score was vital to the character of a revival, stating, \"the only reason for remounting vehicles that have half-vanished...is to get beyond all that is dated into the specific textures of the scores that haven't...there's no point for enduring banality in a book if all you're going to get in return is a random rummage through an attic that produces a perhaps bountiful but essentially characterless heap\".\n\nCritics differed on what they considered the show's good points to be. In the \"Daily News\", Douglas Watt declared, \"the dancing is the best part of the show\" but deemed the vocal arrangements \"too-busy\". Gottfried, however, said the show was \"stolen by the vocal arranger\", whom he credited with \"dazzling harmonizations and stylings\". He disliked the staging, saying it was suitable \"for a concert rather than theater and [allowed] little acting\". Barnes, however, pronounced the staging \"very good,\" saying, \"It has a sense of style, a sense of period and a few bursts of energy that really work\". Barnes praised the sets and costumes, while Watt asserted that the costumes seemed to vacillate between the '20s and '30s and that the sets were \"uninteresting and cheap-looking\".\n\nAlice Faye and Gene Nelson's performances received mixed reviews. Watt said that Faye \"doesn't add much to the show,\" and Gottfried asserted that \"combined,[Faye and Nelson] have the stage presence of a balcony seat\". \"Time\" said that \"[Faye and Nelson] only succeed in underlining the show's decrepitude.\" Barnes, however, stated that though Faye \"is not the most animated leading lady...her light baritone voice is pleasing, and she unquestionably dances with the guts of a Ruby Keeler. Gene Nelson...has enormous personal charm and stage professionalism.\" Kerr said that Faye \"sounds winsome and welcome...she is a composed performer and a willing workhorse\". The actors portraying the young college students were generally well received. In his review, Barnes praised Jana Robbins, Barbara Lail, Marti Rolph, Scott Stevenson, and Wayne Bryan for their performances as the principal student characters. In \"Newsweek\", Jack Kroll declared, \"One's heart goes out to the young people in a show like this, like Barbara Lail and Marti Rolph, whose drive and energy really must carry [the show]\". Marti Rolph, in the role of Connie Lane, received particular praise from critics. Watt declared, \"The only really good singing voice among the principals belongs to Marti Rolph\". Gottfried wrote, \"The only standout, really, is Marti Rolph--the ingenue--who has a gorgeous voice and manages to inject pert spirit into a spiritless show\".\n\nThe 1993 Musical Theatre of Wichita production was well received by local critics. In \"The Wichita Eagle\", Susan L. Rife wrote that the new production was a \"lavish ode to the outright goofiness of the Roaring '20s\", praising the actors' exuberance and the choreography. She suggested that the show's three-hour run time was too long, and noted that \"its pace swings wildly from high-energy dance numbers to slow-moving chunks of dialogue\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2261491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2261491", "title": "Mark Knowles", "text": "Mark Knowles\n\nMark Knowles (born 4 September 1971) is a professional tennis coach and former professional tennis player from the Bahamas, former number 1 in world specialising in doubles tennis. He won all of the Grand Slam tournaments, most notably partnering with Daniel Nestor. At various times between 2002 and 2005 he was ranked World No. 1 in doubles. He is a five-time Olympian.\nAfter being awarded a scholarship to the Nick Bollettieri's famed academy at 10 years old, Knowles played three seasons at UCLA, where he earned All-American honours in both singles and doubles. His highest ATP singles ranking was world no. 96. He was very successful in doubles, partnering Daniel Nestor, Mahesh Bhupathi. With Nestor, Knowles won the 2002 Australian Open, the 2004 US Open and the 2007 French Open. He also won the 2009 Wimbledon Mixed doubles title with Anna-Lena Grönefeld of Germany.\n\nOn 5 July 2006, Knowles and Nestor participated in one of the longest matches in Wimbledon history. Their quarterfinal match against Sweden's Simon Aspelin and Australian Todd Perry lasted 6 hours and 9 minutes, with Knowles and Nestor eventually winning 5–7, 6–3, 6–7(5–7), 6–2, 23–21.\n\nHis 13 year partnership with Daniel Nestor ended after the 2007 US Open. After reaching the Basel final with James Blake, Knowles reunited with Nestor once again to win the 2007 Tennis Masters Cup. They defeated Simon Aspelin and Julian Knowle, 6–3, 6–2, to take their first Tennis Masters Cup title.\n\nKnowles then played with fellow Grand Slam doubles champion Mahesh Bhupathi, for two seasons in 2008 and 2009, and the two were one of the most successful teams on tour, qualifying for the season-ending championships in both years. After losing in their season debut in Sydney, Knowles and Bhupathi knocked out defending champions Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, taking the gripping match in a final set tiebreak. The two lost to eventual champions Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram. Other season highlights included three titles, at Memphis, Dubai and Basel. The victory in Basel gave Knowles his 50th career title.\n\nAt the 2009 Australian Open, Knowles and Bhupathi went one step further than the year before, reaching the final before losing to the Bryans in three sets, after winning the first set 6–2. They went on to reach the US Open final later that year, despite the fact that Knowles was hampered by a hand injury that required eight stitches on his dominant hand (right). They also claimed their first ATP World Tour Masters 1000 crown together, winning the Rogers Cup in Montreal. They closed out their partnership at the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals, winning their round-robin group before going down in the semifinals to the Bryans. Knowles also repeated as champion in Memphis with Mardy Fish.\n\nIn 2010, Knowles joined forces with Fish, and after both struggled with injuries the first half of the season, the two captured the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, defeating Tomáš Berdych and Radek Štěpánek in the final. The two advanced to the quarterfinals of the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati and the third round of the US Open. Knowles finished the season on a high note with a runner-up finish at the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 event in Paris with Andy Ram. The two upset top-ranked Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan in the quarterfinals.\n\n2011 was a tough year for the Bahamian, as his season partner, Michal Mertiňák, went down with a back injury at the French Open. Prior to that, the two made semifinal appearances in San Jose and Memphis and the quarterfinals of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells. After falling in the first round of Wimbledon with Łukasz Kubot, Knowles played his 10th season of World TeamTennis with the Sacramento Capitals, and then partnered Xavier Malisse to the Farmers Classic title at his former college campus, UCLA. The two edged Somdev Devvarman and Treat Conrad Huey to give the Bahamian his 54th doubles title. Knowles and Malisse also reached the quarterfinals in Washington and the third round at the US Open.\n\nIn October, Knowles was invited to participate in the 19th annual World TeamTennis Smash Hits charity event in Cleveland, co-hosted by Sir Elton John and Billie Jean King. Knowles was selected by John as a member of his team, which went on to win the exhibition 19–18. The event raised over $500,000 for various AIDS charities.\n\nAt the 2012 SAP Open, Knowles rejoined Malisse to win the ATP World Tour 250 event in San Jose, becoming the first men's player over 40 to win a tour-level doubles title since John McEnroe.\n\nKnowles was a standout at UCLA for three years, earning All-American honors in singles and doubles before turning pro in 1991.\n\nRepresenting the Bahamas, Knowles competed in five consecutive Olympic Games (1992-2008) and is his country's all-time leader in Davis Cup wins, playing in 29 ties. He received the prestigious Davis Cup Commitment Award from ITF president Francesco Ricci Bitti at the All England Club in 2014.\n\nIn World TeamTennis, Knowles was the captain of the Sacramento Capitals for 10 years, picking up three Male MVP Awards. His team won championships in 2002 and 2007.\n\nKnowles announced his retirement from professional tennis in September 2012, but took part in men's and mixed doubles at Wimbledon 2013, where he and British player Jamie Delgado shared the all-time male record for playing in consecutive Wimbledon tournaments, with 22 appearances in the Open era. However the following year 2014, Jamie Delgado played doubles in the main draw to take the record of 23 appearances, while Knowles returned for an exhibition doubles only.\n\nDuring his final full season on tour, Knowles was hired by his former doubles partner Mardy Fish to coach him. They begin working together in Miami in 2012.\n\nSince 2013, Knowles has worked on-air for Tennis Channel, providing in-match commentary, courtside interviews and tournament desk analysis.\n\nHe started coaching top 10 tennis player Milos Raonic in June 2017, before the grass court season.\n\nCurrently, he is coaching top American player Jack Sock.\n\nKnowles was elected by his peers as Vice-President of the ATP and was selected to be on the ATP Drug Force Council.\n\n"}

He played college basketball for the Florida State Seminoles.\n\nWafer has previously played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) with the Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers, Denver Nuggets, Portland Trail Blazers, Houston Rockets, Boston Celtics and Orlando Magic. He was the 39th overall selection (ninth pick of the second round) in the 2005 NBA draft by the Lakers. His nickname is \"The Dutch Cookie\".\n\nWafer attended Pineview High School in Lisbon, Louisiana during his freshman, sophomore and junior years of high school. He averaged 32 points, 10 rebounds and 7 assists during his junior season. Up to that point, Wafer was a virtual unknown on the national recruiting scene. Tim Loring, the coach of the Arkansas Wings AAU team, invited Wafer to play for them the summer before his senior year. This allowed Wafer to display his skills on a wider stage, and by the end of the summer, he was considered to be one of the top ten seniors on many recruiting lists. He was also briefly at R.L. Paschal High School and Laurinburg Institute his senior year before deciding to attend and play at Heritage Christian Academy in Cleveland, Texas, where he averaged 26 points, 8 rebounds, 4 steals, and 4 blocks per game.\n\nWafer was the seventh McDonald's High School All-American to play at Florida State University. During the game, he scored 8 points and finished second to LeBron James in the McDonald's All-American slam-dunk contest.\n\nDuring his freshman year at Florida State University in the 2003–04 season, Wafer averaged 7.9 points in 17.5 minutes a game with the Seminoles. He ranked third among all ACC freshmen with 43 three-point field goals made and scored in double figures 12 times. As a sophomore during the 2004–05 season, he led the team in scoring (12.5 ppg) and three-point field goals made (65). He made more than one three-point field goal in 14 games and surpassed the 20-point mark on six occasions. Despite some success that year, he was suspended for two games early in the season and benched frequently later. The \"Tallahassee Democrat\" reported that his family explained the suspensions were because of missed classes and study sessions.\n\nWafer declared himself as an early-entry candidate for the 2005 NBA draft after his sophomore year at FSU despite many draft experts predicting he would not be drafted. There were several hurdles he had to overcome to become a viable option for an NBA team to select him. Wafer was not invited to the annual Chicago pre-draft camp, which provides players who are not viewed as first-round prospects a chance to display their abilities in front of NBA team personnel. During a workout with the Phoenix Suns, Wafer reportedly was frustrated by the physical play from Jan Jagla, and responded by laying an intentional elbow to Jagla's nose, then walked off the court and ended the workout at that point. Los Angeles Lakers scout Irving Thomas, who played two seasons at FSU, saw three Seminoles games during the 2004–05 season and helped arrange a workout for Wafer with the Lakers. Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak saw enough of Wafer's ability that they used the second of their two second-round picks to select Wafer in the draft.\n\nWafer was placed on waivers by the Lakers on October 26, 2006. He played in only one pre-season game due to a bruised left heel. Wafer then played for the Colorado 14ers of the NBA Development League during 2006–07, and was named Player of the Month in January 2007. He was signed to a ten-day contract by the Los Angeles Clippers on February 21. He played one minute without scoring before being waived a week later. On April 12, 2007, the Denver Nuggets signed Wafer for the remainder of the 2006–07 season.\n\nOn February 21, 2008, the Denver Nuggets traded Wafer to the Portland Trail Blazers for Taurean Green. Wafer changed his number from 22 (which he wore with the Nuggets) to 24, as number 22 had been retired by the Trail Blazers to honor Clyde Drexler.\n\nWafer was signed by the Houston Rockets and managed to keep a spot on the team due to his hot shooting in the preseason. On January 13, 2009, Wafer scored a career-high 23 points on 10-14 shooting in 39 minutes against the Los Angeles Lakers. He found a regular place in the Rockets' starting lineup due to good performance as well as an injury to regular starter Tracy McGrady. He continued to impress by scoring 21 points versus the Jazz and hitting the game-winning three at a game in Boston that the Rockets won 89–85. In that month he averaged 14.3 points per game. After Wafer moved to a team in Greece, the Rockets offered him a contract midway through the next season. He signed the contract, but failed his physical, so he could not join the Rockets.\n\nWafer joined the Greek Euroleague club Olympiacos Piraeus in August 2009, signing a two-year $10 million gross income contract. He was then waived by Olympiacos in December 2009. Wafer shot 36.4% from the field and averaged 3.0 points per game and 1.3 rebounds per game in the Greek A1 League with Olympiacos. In Euroleague play, he shot 50% from the field and averaged 7.7 points per game, 1.3 rebounds per game, and 1.0 assists per game.\n\nOn February 24, 2010, Wafer signed a ten-day contract with the Dallas Mavericks. He was not expected to crack the rotation during his tenure and although he was eligible to play six games, Wafer finished his contract with Dallas without playing a single minute.\n\nOn July 3, 2010, Wafer signed a free agent deal with the Boston Celtics. On October 29, 2010, he was involved in a locker-room altercation with new teammate Delonte West.\n\nIn August 2011, during the 2011 NBA lockout, he signed a one-year contract with Vanoli-Braga Cremona in Italy.\n\nWafer was traded to the Magic on December 12, 2011, along with Glen Davis for Brandon Bass. He was waived by the Magic at the end of the 2011–12 season.\n\nWafer moved to China in 2012, signed a one-year contract with Xinjiang Flying Tigers worth $2 million. He played 34 games for Xinjiang, averaged 26.4 points with a shooting percentage of 55.4%. He also got 4.4 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 1.1 steals per game.\n\nIn October 2013, he signed with the Shanghai Sharks, the team owned by his former teammate Yao Ming at the Rockets. In December 2013, he left the Sharks.\n\nOn January 10, 2014, he was acquired by the Bakersfield Jam of the NBA Development League. On January 28, 2014, he was waived by the Jam.\n\nOn February 3, 2014, he signed with BC Krasny Oktyabr for the rest of the 2013–2014 season.\n\nOn November 26, 2016, Wafer returned to the United States, signing with the Delaware 87ers of the NBA Development League.\n\nOn December 14, 2016, Wafer was traded to the Westchester Knicks in exchange for Devondrick Walker.\n\nOn January 27, 2017, Wafer returned to China, signing with the Jilin Northeast Tigers.\n\n"}

The message of good news is described as a narrative in the four canonical gospels.\n\nThe message of good news is described as theology in many of the New Testament letters. It relates to the saving acts of God due to the work of Jesus on the cross and Jesus' resurrection from the dead which bring reconciliation (\"atonement\") between people and God. The apostle Paul's gospel is of Jesus's death on the cross and resurrection to restore people's relationship with God. It may also include the descent of the Holy Spirit upon believers and the second coming of Jesus. Paul gave the following summary (translated into English) of this good news (gospel) in the First Epistle to the Corinthians,one of his letters to Christians in the city of Corinth:\n\nNow I make known to you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand, by which also you are saved, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain.\nFor I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, (1 Corinthians 15:1-4 NASB)\n\nChristian theology describes the Good News of salvation in Jesus Christ not as a new concept, but one that has been foretold throughout the Old Testament and was prophetically preached even at the time of the fall of man as contained in Genesis 3:14–15, which has been called the \"Proto-Evangelion\" or \"Proto-Gospel\".\n\nGospel () is the Old English translation of Greek , meaning \"good news\". This may be seen from analysis of \"euangélion\" (εὖ \"eû\" \"good\" + ἄγγελος \"ángelos\" \"messenger\" + -ιον \"-ion\" diminutive suffix). The Greek term was Latinized as \"evangelium\" in the Vulgate, and translated into Latin as \"bona annuntiatio\".\n\nIn Old English, it was translated as \"gōdspel\" (\"gōd\" \"good\" + \"spel\" \"news\"). The Old English term was retained as \"gospel\" in Middle English Bible translations and hence remains in use also in Modern English. The written accounts of the life and teaching of Jesus are also generally known as \"Gospels\".\n\nThe good news can be summarized in many ways, reflecting various emphases. Cambridge New Testament scholar C.H. Dodd (1964 ) has summarized the Christian good news as taught by the apostle Peter in the Book of Acts (see Kerygma; Acts 2:14-41; Acts 3:11-4:4; Acts 10:34-43):\n\n\nGenerally speaking, the Gospel of Jesus Christ, or the message of salvation, justification, and sanctification, is explained by the apostle Paul in his epistle to the Romans, especially in chapters 3 to 8.\n\nChristian writers and teachers often present the Good News set within the context of the storyline of the whole Bible. This discipline, of understanding the Christian message in terms of biblical salvation history, is known as biblical theology. This attempts to posit a connection between Old Testament and the Christian teachings of the good news about the life, death and resurrection of Jesus.\n\nFor example, the Roman Catholic Church promotes the teaching of the good news in the context of biblical salvation history as a \"fundamental part of the content\" of its instruction. There are numerous exponents of the biblical theology approach to understanding the Good News. Some Christian teachers and biblical theologians who have published descriptions of the Bible authors' message in terms of salvation history include Köstenberger and O'Brien (2001), who have published a biblical theology of mission; and Goldsworthy (1991), who writes from an evangelical Christian perspective. Many Bible scholars and Christian groups have placed similar descriptions on the internet. There is a degree of variation in perspective between such descriptions. However, the main focus is generally the same: the Bible storyline tells of God working throughout history to save a people for himself, and these saving acts are completed through the person and work of Jesus.\n\nThe good news is described in many different ways in the Bible. Each one reflects different emphases, and describes part or all of the Biblical narrative. Christian teaching of the good news — including the preaching of the Apostles in the Book of Acts — generally focuses upon the resurrection of Jesus and its implications. Sometimes in the Bible, the good news is described in other terms, but it still describes God's saving acts. For example, the Apostle Paul taught that the good news was announced to the patriarch Abraham in the words, \"All nations will be blessed through you.\" (Galatians 3:6-9; c.f. Genesis 12:1-3).\n\nLiberation theology, articulated in the teachings of Latin American Catholic theologians Leonardo Boff and Gustavo Gutiérrez, emphasizes that Jesus came not only to save humanity, but also to liberate the poor and oppressed. A similar movement among the Latin American evangelical movement is \"Integral Mission\", where the church is seen as an agent for positively transforming the wider world, in response to the good news. This can likewise be seen in black theology of certain African and African American Christians.\n\nHowever, the Liberation Theology was accurately pointed out by Cardinal Ratzinger (1984) as a marxist view of christianity, which stresses only the economic aspect of \"liberation\":\"Liberation is first and foremost liberation from the radical slavery of sin. Its end and its goal is the freedom of the children of God, which is the gift of grace. As a logical consequence, it calls for freedom from many different kinds of slavery in the cultural, economic, social, and political spheres, all of which derive ultimately from sin, and so often prevent people from living in a manner befitting their dignity. [...]\n\nConcepts uncritically borrowed from Marxist ideology and recourse to theses of a biblical hermeneutic marked by rationalism are at the basis of the new interpretation which is corrupting whatever was authentic in the generous initial commitment on behalf of the poor.\n\nThe Christian missions movement believes the Christian good news to be a message for all peoples, of all nations, tribes, cultures and languages. This movement teaches that it is through the good news of Jesus that the nations of humanity are restored to relationship with God; and that the destiny of the nations is related to this process. Missiology professor Howard A. Snyder writes, \"God has chosen to place the [worldwide] Church with Christ at the very center of His plan to reconcile the world to himself (Ephesians 1:20-23)\".\n\nAnother perspective described in the writings of the Apostle Paul is that it is through the good news of Jesus' death and resurrection, and the resulting worship of people from all nations, that evil is defeated on a cosmic scale. Reflecting on the third chapter of Paul's letter to the Ephesians, theologian Howard A. Snyder writes:\n\n\"God's plan for the [worldwide] church extends to the fullest extent of the cosmos. By God's 'manifold wisdom' the [worldwide] Church displays an early fullness of what Christ will accomplish at the conclusion of all the ages. The spectacle is to reach beyond the range of humanity, even to the angelic realms. The [worldwide] church is to be God's display of Christ's reconciling love,\".\n\n\n\n"}

A variety of aluminium bronzes of differing compositions have found industrial use, with most ranging from 5% to 11% aluminium by weight, the remaining mass being copper; other alloying agents such as iron, nickel, manganese, and silicon are also sometimes added to aluminium bronzes.\n\nThe following table lists the most common standard aluminium bronze wrought alloy compositions, by ISO 428 designations. The percentages show the proportional composition of the alloy by weight. Copper is the remainder by weight and is not listed:\n\nAluminium bronzes are most valued for their higher strength and corrosion resistance as compared to other bronze alloys. These alloys are tarnish-resistant and show low rates of corrosion in atmospheric conditions, low oxidation rates at high temperatures, and low reactivity with sulfurous compounds and other exhaust products of combustion. They are also resistant to corrosion in sea water. Aluminium bronzes' resistance to corrosion results from the aluminium in the alloys, which reacts with atmospheric oxygen to form a thin, tough surface layer of alumina (aluminium oxide) which acts as a barrier to corrosion of the copper-rich alloy. The addition of tin can improve corrosion resistance.\n\nAnother notable property of aluminium bronzes are their biostatic effects. The copper component of the alloy prevents colonization by marine organisms including algae, lichens, barnacles, and mussels, and therefore can be preferable to stainless steel or other non-cupric alloys in applications where such colonization would be unwanted.\n\nAluminium bronzes tend to have a golden color.\n\nAluminium bronzes are most commonly used in applications where their resistance to corrosion makes them preferable to other engineering materials. These applications include plain bearings and landing gear components on aircraft, guitar strings, valve components, engine components (especially for seagoing ships), underwater fastenings in naval architecture, and ship propellers. Aluminium bronze is also used to fulfil the ATEX directive for Zones 1, 2, 21, and 22. The attractive gold-toned coloration of aluminium bronzes has also led to their use in jewellery.\n\nAluminium bronzes are in the highest demand from the following industries and areas:\n\n\nAluminium bronze can be welded using the MIG welding technique with an aluminium bronze core and pure argon gas.\n\nAluminium bronze is used to replace gold for the casting of dental crowns. The alloys used are chemically inert and have the appearance of gold.\n\nAlloys similar to aluminium bronze are used in making coins, for example the 20, 200 and 500 Italian Lire, 10 Philippine peso coin on the inner ring, the one and two dollar coins of Australian and New Zealand currency produced by the Royal Australian Mint, some Mexican coins and the Nordic gold used for some euro coins. The Canadian 2 dollar coin, produced by the Royal Canadian Mint and circulated since 1996, is a bi-metallic piece with an outer ring of nickel-plated steel and an inner circle of Aluminium bronze composed of 92% copper, 6% Aluminium, and 2% nickel (also known as Bronzital).\n\n"}

In 2011, the Saudi Binladin Group signed a US$1.23 billion contractual agreement to construct the tallest building in the world, Jeddah Tower in Jeddah. They also are party to a US$3.4 billion agreement to construct the Doha Metro located at Doha. The conglomerate comprises an estimated 537 companies.\n\nThe SBG was founded in 1931 by Sheikh Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden Sayyid, whose relationship with the country's founder, Abdel Aziz al Saud, led to important government contracts such as refurbishing the mosques at Mecca and Medina.\n\nIn 1964, Mohammed bin Laden was commissioned, recladding the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. After the death of Sheikh Mohammed in 1967, the group was headed by Mohammed Bahareth, brother of Mohammed's first wife and uncle of his oldest children. In 1972, Salem bin Laden, the eldest son of Mohammed bin Laden, took over as his father's successor, with the assistance of several brothers. Upon Salem's death in a plane crash in 1988, the leadership of the group passed to one of Salem's brothers, Bakr, the current chairman, along with thirteen other brothers who make up the board of the bin Laden group, the most important of these being Hassan bin Laden, Yeslam bin Ladin and Yehia bin Laden. The most controversial brother was Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al-Qaeda who directed the September 11 attacks. Questions have been raised into the family's personal and business interests in terrorism.\n\nThe Group considered an initial public offering in 2011, but declined to do so due to a combination of low oil prices, a weak stock market, and bureaucratic obstacles.\n\nIn April 2018, Bakr bin Laden, as well as his brothers Saleh and Saad, transferred their 36.2% stake in the Saudi Binladin Group to the Istidama Holding Company, which is owned by the Ministry of Finance. The government of Saudi Arabia subsequently established a five-person committee to run the Binladen Group, which includes of Abdulrehman al-Harkan, Khaled Nahas, Khalid al-Khowaiter. Reuters described the ownership transfer as a functional nationalization, with al-Harkan, the committee's chairman, reporting to Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan. al-Karkan subsequently negotiated an 11 billion riyal loan from the Ministry of Finance.\n\nThe bin Laden group is represented in most Saudi cities — Riyadh, Dammam — and in a number of capital cities in the region (Beirut, Cairo, Amman, Dubai). According to a synopsis by the PBS news program \"Frontline\":\n\nThe Group has constructed Abraj Al Bait Towers in Mecca and has been contracted by Kingdom Holding Company to build the Jeddah Tower.\n\nOn 11 September 2015, while doing construction work in the Grand Mosque in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, one of the Group's cranes collapsed due to high winds causing 118 deaths and almost 400 injuries. As a result, the Saudi king banned the firm from taking new projects while having its current projects reviewed. The Saudi government removed the ban on the Binladin Group in May 2016, allowing them to bid on new projects.\n\n\n\nSBG's Internet domain name, saudi-binladin-group.com, was registered on September 11, 2000, for one year, expiring on the same day as the September 11 attacks.

Doelz and Earl T. Heald. Similar to OQPSK, MSK is encoded with bits alternating between quadrature components, with the Q component delayed by half the symbol period. \n\nHowever, instead of square pulses as OQPSK uses, MSK encodes each bit as a half sinusoid. This results in a constant-modulus signal (constant envelope signal), which reduces problems caused by non-linear distortion. In addition to being viewed as related to OQPSK, MSK can also be viewed as a continuous phase frequency shift keyed (CPFSK) signal with a frequency separation of one-half the bit rate.\n\nIn MSK the difference between the higher and lower frequency is identical to half the bit rate. Consequently, the waveforms used to represent a 0 and a 1 bit differ by exactly half a carrier period. Thus, the maximum frequency deviation is formula_1 = 0.5 f where f is the maximum modulating frequency. As a result, the modulation index \"m\" is 0.5. This is the smallest FSK modulation index that can be chosen such that the waveforms for 0 and 1 are orthogonal. A variant of MSK called Gaussian minimum-shift keying (GMSK) is used in the GSM mobile phone standard.\n\nThe resulting signal is represented by the formula: \n\nwhere formula_3 is the energy per one bit, formula_4 is the noise spectral density, formula_5 denotes the Q-function and formula_6 denotes the complementary error function.\n\nGaussian minimum-shift keying, or GMSK, is similar to standard minimum-shift keying (MSK); however, the digital data stream is first shaped with a Gaussian filter before being applied to a frequency modulator, and typically has much narrower phase shift angles than most MSK modulation systems. This has the advantage of reducing sideband power, which in turn reduces out-of-band interference between signal carriers in adjacent frequency channels.\n\nHowever, the Gaussian filter increases the modulation memory in the system and causes intersymbol interference, making it more difficult to differentiate between different transmitted data values and requiring more complex channel equalization algorithms such as an adaptive equalizer at the receiver. GMSK has high spectral efficiency, but it needs a higher power level than QPSK, for instance, in order to reliably transmit the same amount of data.\n\nGMSK is most notably used in the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), in the Bluetooth, in the satellite communications, and Automatic Identification System (AIS) for maritime navigation.\n\n\n"}

The goal of user interface design is to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as possible, in terms of accomplishing user goals (user-centered design).\n\nGood user interface design facilitates finishing the task at hand without drawing unnecessary attention to itself. Graphic design and typography are utilized to support its usability, influencing how the user performs certain interactions and improving the aesthetic appeal of the design; design aesthetics may enhance or detract from the ability of users to use the functions of the interface. The design process must balance technical functionality and visual elements (e.g., mental model) to create a system that is not only operational but also usable and adaptable to changing user needs.\n\nInterface design is involved in a wide range of projects from computer systems, to cars, to commercial planes; all of these projects involve much of the same basic human interactions yet also require some unique skills and knowledge. As a result, designers tend to specialize in certain types of projects and have skills centered on their expertise, whether it is a software design, user research, web design, or industrial design.\n\nUser interface design requires a good understanding of user needs. It mainly focuses on the requirements of the platform and its user expectations. There are several phases and processes in the user interface design, some of which are more demanded upon than others, depending on the project. (Note: for the remainder of this section, the word \"system\" is used to denote any project whether it is a website, application, or device.)\n\nThe dynamic characteristics of a system are described in terms of the dialogue requirements contained in seven principles of part 10 of the ergonomics standard, the ISO 9241. This standard establishes a framework of ergonomic \"principles\" for the dialogue techniques with high-level definitions and illustrative applications and examples of the principles. The principles of the dialogue represent the dynamic aspects of the interface and can be mostly regarded as the \"feel\" of the interface.\nThe seven dialogue principles are:\n\nThe concept of usability is defined of the ISO 9241 standard by effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the user. Part 11 gives the following definition of usability:\nEffectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction can be seen as quality factors of usability. To evaluate these factors, they need to be decomposed into sub-factors, and finally, into usability measures.\n\nThe information presentation is described in Part 12 of the ISO 9241 standard for the organization of information (arrangement, alignment, grouping, labels, location), for the display of graphical objects, and for the coding of information (abbreviation, color, size, shape, visual cues) by seven attributes. The \"attributes of presented information\" represent the static aspects of the interface and can be generally regarded as the \"look\" of the interface. The attributes are detailed in the recommendations given in the standard. Each of the recommendations supports one or more of the seven attributes.\nThe seven presentation attributes are:\n\nThe user guidance in Part 13 of the ISO 9241 standard describes that the user guidance information should be readily distinguishable from other displayed information and should be specific for the current context of use. User guidance can be given by the following five means:\n\nUser interface design has been a topic of considerable research, including on its aesthetics. Standards have been developed as far back as the 1980s for defining the usability of software products.\nOne of the structural bases has become the IFIP user interface reference model. The model proposes four dimensions to structure the user interface:\nThis model has greatly influenced the development of the international standard ISO 9241 describing the interface design requirements for usability.\nThe desire to understand application-specific UI issues early in software development, even as an application was being developed, led to research on GUI rapid prototyping tools that might offer convincing simulations of how an actual application might behave in production use. Some of this research has shown that a wide variety of programming tasks for GUI-based software can, in fact, be specified through means other than writing program code.\n\nResearch in recent years is strongly motivated by the increasing variety of devices that can, by virtue of Moore's law, host very complex interfaces.\n"}

The song also plays on silent letters in other words such as \"k-now\" and \"w-ho\", and adds initial \"g\"'s to various words beginning with \"n\".\n\nMichael Flanders introduces the piece with a humorous monologue explaining how he came to write it. He tells the story of a car — \"great big flashy thing, with teeth; engine at both ends\" — that is the bane of his existence, since it constantly occupies the one spot in the road outside his house where he can comfortably get from wheelchair to car and vice versa. The licence number, he explains, is 346 GNU. The song itself then begins, and consists of a brief piano introduction and two similar sung verses, each preceded by a verse spoken by Michael Flanders. Donald Swann neither speaks nor sings in this item.\nIn the first verse, the singer is at the zoo when he meets a man who claims to know all the\nanimals, but misidentifies a gnu as a \"helk\"; the gnu corrects him. In the second verse,\nhe has taken furnished lodgings, and wakes up in the night to see a stuffed hunting trophy\nabove his bed; he is trying to decide whether the animal's head could be a bison, an okapi or a hartebeest, when he seems to hear a voice, asserting indignantly that it is a \"g-nu, a-g-nother g-nu\".\n\nFlanders and Swann first performed and recorded this song in their revue \"At the Drop of a Hat\". It was released as a single on the Parlophone label in 1957 under the title \"A Gnu\", and produced by future Beatles producer George Martin.\n\n\n"}

Family friends included Pete Seeger, and actor/singer/activist Paul Robeson, Bibb's godfather.\n\nHe was given his first steel-string acoustic guitar at age seven. Growing up surrounded by talent, he recalls a childhood conversation with Bob Dylan, who, on the subject of guitar playing, advised the 11-year-old Bibb to \"Keep it simple, forget all that fancy stuff\" (as recounted in \"The Transatlantic Sessions 5\" program and DVD from the BBC).\n\nBibb remembers from his early teen years:I would cut school and claim I was sick. When everyone would leave the house I would whip out all the records and do my own personal DJ thing all day long, playing Odetta, Joan Baez, the New Lost City Ramblers, Josh White.\n\nWhen Bibb was 16 years old, his father invited him to play guitar in the house band for his TV talent show \"Someone New\". Bill Lee, who played bass in this band, later appeared on Bibb's albums \"Me To You\" and \"Friends\". In 1969, Bibb played guitar for the Negro Ensemble Company at St. Mark's Place in New York. \n\nHe went on to study psychology and Russian at Columbia University, but did not finish these studies. The next year, aged 19, he left for Paris, where he met guitarist Mickey Baker who focused his interest on blues guitar.\n\nBibb moved to Stockholm, where he immersed himself in pre-war blues and the newly discovered world music scene, while he continued to write and perform. \"Good Stuff\" was released in 1997 on Opus 3 and the American label Earthbeat. Bibb signed to the British-based Code Blue label, but only released one album, \"Me to You\", featuring appearances from some of his personal heroes, Pops and Mavis Staples, and Taj Mahal. This was followed by tours of the UK, US, Canada, France, Sweden and Germany.\n\nIn the late 1990s Bibb joined forces with his then manager Alan Robinson to form Manhaton Records in Britain. The albums \"Home to Me\" (1999), \"Roadworks\" (2000) and \"Painting Signs\" (2001) followed, as did the 2005 releases for Opus 3, \"Just Like Love\" and \"Spirit & the Blues (Hybrid SACD of 1999 Earthbeat release)\". After that, he made \"A Family Affair\" (2002) with his father, Leon Bibb. This was followed by \"Natural Light\", then \"Friends\", which contained 15 tracks featuring Bibb duetting with friends and musicians he had met on his travels such as Taj Mahal, Odetta, Charlie Musselwhite, Guy Davis, Mamadou Diabate and Djelimady Toukara.\n\nIn 2004, Eric Bibb released \"Friends\" as his debut release under Telarc International Corporation. Bibb remained with Telarc Records from 2004 until 2011, releasing several additional albums including, \"A Ship Called Love\" in 2005, \"Diamond Days\" in 2007, and \"Spirit I Am\" in 2008. He released \"Booker's Guitar\" in January 2010 with music channeled from the Delta guitar master himself, Booker White, also known as Bukka White. In November 2011, Bibb signed to Stony Plain Records.\nIn 2018, Bibb opened for George Benson on his UK tour.\n\nBibb received Grammy nominations for \"Shakin' a Tailfeather\" in 1997 and \"Migration Blues\" in 2017.\nHe has been nominated for several Blues Music Awards (formerly known as the W.C.

The cantata is based on the seven stanzas of Martin Luther's hymn \"\", about baptism. The first and last stanza of the chorale were used for the outer movements of the cantata, while an unknown librettist paraphrased the inner stanzas of the hymn into the text for the five other movements. The first movement, a chorale fantasia, is followed by a succession of arias alternating with recitatives, leading to a four-part closing chorale.\n\nThe cantata is scored for three vocal soloists (alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir, two oboes d'amore, two solo violins, strings and continuo.\nBach composed for St. John's Day, 24 June 1724, in Leipzig, as the third cantata of his second annual cycle, the chorale cantata cycle, which had begun about two weeks earlier on the first Sunday after Trinity. The cycle was devoted to Lutheran hymns, in the format of his chorale cantatas rendered by retaining their text of the first and last stanza, while a contemporary poet reworded the inner stanzas.\n\nThe prescribed readings for the feast of the birth of John the Baptist were from the Book of Isaiah, \"the voice of a preacher in the desert\" (), and from the Gospel of Luke, the birth of John the Baptist and the of Zechariah (). Martin Luther's hymn \"\" (To Jordan came our Lord the Christ) is associated with the feast. Its topic, differing from that of the readings, is baptism, which is treated based on biblical accounts, starting from Christ's baptism by John the Baptist in the river Jordan. The hymn tune is \"\", Zahn No. 7246.\n\nBach used the text of the first stanza of Luther's hymn for the first movement of his cantata, with its chorale melody sung as . The final movement of the cantata is a four-part chorale setting of the seventh stanza, on the hymn tune. The five arias and recitatives between these choral movements are settings of text paraphrased from the hymn's other stanzas.\n\nThe cantata in seven movements is scored for three vocal soloists (alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir (SATB), two oboes d'amore (Oa), two solo violins (Vs, the second one only introduced in a later performance), two violins (Vl), viola (Va) and basso continuo (Bc).\n\nThe seven-movement cantata begins with a chorale fantasia and ends, after a sequence of alternating arias and recitatives, with a closing chorale as a four-part setting. Bach increased the number of accompanying instruments for the arias, from only continuo in the second movement, over two solo violins in the central movement of the cantata, to two oboes d'amore and strings in the sixth movement.\n\nIn the opening chorus, \"\" (Christ our Lord came to the Jordan), the tenor has the melody as a cantus firmus, while the other voices sing free counterpoint. In the first cantata of the chorale cantata cycle, , Bach had given the cantus firmus of the chorale tune to the soprano, and in the second, , to the alto.\n\nThe opening chorus resembles an Italian violin concerto. The musicologist Julian Mincham likens the \"solo violin's persistent, rocking, wave-like idea\" to the waves of the Jordan River. Alfred Dürr compares the vocal sections, all with the solo violin, to the solo sections of a violin concerto, as opposed to the tutti sections with the orchestra. John Eliot Gardiner interprets the movement as a French overture, \"replete with grandiloquent baroque gestures to suggest both the processional\nentrance of Jesus and the powerful flooding of the River Jordan\". Klaus Hofmann notes that the movement combines the old style of motet writing with the new type of solo concerto, and observes that \"the main violin solo episodes ... are at first linked to the choral entries, but gradually assume larger proportions and greater independence as the movement progresses\".\n\nThe first aria, \"\" (Mark and hear, you humans), is accompanied by the continuo alone. Mincham observes that a characteristic fast motif of five notes, repeated abundantly in the cello, always flows downward, while Bach usually also inverses motifs, such as in his Inventions. Mincham concludes that it represents the \"pouring of the baptismal waters\".\n\nThe following recitative is given to the tenor as an : \"\" (This God has clearly provided with words), narrating the biblical command to baptise.\n\nThe central aria is sung by the tenor, accompanied by two violins, marked \"solo\" in a later performance, \"\" (The Father's voice can be heard). Gardiner notes that the music \"describes, through its pair of soaring violins, the circling flight of the Holy Spirit as a dove\". Hofmann notes the character of the movement as a gigue, and several appearances of the number 3 as a symbol of the Trinity: it is a trio for voice and two violins, \"in triple time – and markedly so: not only is the time signature 3/4, but also the crotchets are each divided into triplets\", and in a form of three solo sections as \"all variants of a single model that is presented in the opening and concluding ritornellos\". Hofmann concludes: \"The sequence that this creates – three different forms of the same musical substance – is evidently to be understood as a symbol of the Holy Trinity.\"\n\nA recitative for bass, the (voice of Christ), \"\" (As Jesus there, after His passion), speaks of Jesus after his passion and resurrection. It is accompanied by the strings, similar to the words of Jesus in Bach's \"St Matthew Passion\".\n\nThe last aria is sung by the alto with rich accompaniment: \"\" (People, believe this grace now,). The two oboes d'amore double the first violin when human beings are requested to accept the grace of God to not \"perish in the pit of hell\".\n\nThe closing chorale is the final stanza of the hymn, with the instruments playing colla parte: \"\" (The eye sees only water,), a summary of Luther's teaching about baptism.\n\nIn 1851, about a century before the cantata got its BWV number, it was published as No. 7 in the first volume of the Bach-Gesellschaft-Ausgabe. In the New Bach Edition the cantata was included in Series I, Volume 29, \"Kantaten zum Johannisfest\" (Cantatas for St. John's Day). Calmus and Breitkopf & Härtel published performance scores. The Breitkopf score translates the cantata's title as \"Lord Christ of old to Jordan came\".\n\nA list of recordings is provided on the Bach Cantatas Website.

Upon its release in August 2010, development was restarted in January 2011, though the company has been quiet on the game's status since.\n\n\"Society\" plays as a massively multiplayer online real-time strategy. The game starts with the player obtaining a single province, of which 50,000 exist on a single server. From there, the player must build up their province, creating buildings, schools, factories, and other infrastructure necessary for a subset of people to exist. Upon the creation of a successful province, the player must decide on how to interact with all of the other provinces, many of which are other player's provinces, whether it be forcefully taking them over through war, or using diplomacy to forge cooperation between provinces. The game's world exists in a continual 24-hour world that never stops; progress in the game continues even when the player is away. Artificial intelligence will take over and defend a province when the player is not present. To avoid having players return to the game with their empire entirely destroyed, only 1/4 of a player's provinces may be contested during any one day, and players can band together into empires to take over the defence of each other's provinces, fighting on one another's behalf.\n\nThe game was first announced by Stardock in May 2005, with the company featuring the game as an upcoming title the next month at E3 2005 as well. There, Stardock stated that, while there was no firm release date, they loosely were shooting for a timetable that included an alpha release by the end of the year, a lengthy \"World of Warcraft\"-like beta release by late 2006, and a likely release in 2007. Development was announced to be led by Paul Kerchen, who had previously worked for Maxis on \"Simcity 3000\" and \"Simsville\". The game was also announced to be free to play, a concept that was much more rare in 2005, before the boom of mobile gaming.\n\nDevelopment on the game proved to be difficult and slow in the following years. The team worked on the game throughout 2005 and early 2006, with the goal of having footage to be shown by June 2006 at E3 2006. Unfortunately, the team missed this goal, with progress slowing further as the development team was understaffed, and working on wrapping up production on \"Galactic Civilizations II\" and its subsequent expansion packs. Stardock was quiet about the project until 2009, where the company stated they would refocus their development on the game after they shipped their next title \"\". After said game's release in 2010, in February 2011, Stardock announced that \"Society\" was experiencing funding issues, but that the company was searching for ways to address the problem through the expanding of their business units and finding partners to work on it as well.\n\n"}

At maximum extent some 70,000 acres (283 km) can be inundated by the annual Nile flood, but a more regular year sees only about half that. This has led to a high population density in history that has long made the \"Kerma Basin\" one of the central portions of Nubia. The ancient city of Kerma was in the basin.

Near the hotel is the Shot Tower, the National Mississippi River Museum and Aquarium, Diamond Jo Casino, and the Dubuque Star Brewery. The Alliant Energy Amphitheater is located next to the brewery, and is the site of concerts and other events.\n\nWith the addition of the Grand Harbor, and with construction proceeding on a new Hilton hotel, many in the hotel industry have come to feel that the hotel market in Dubuque was becoming saturated. Because of this, the Dubuque Inn - which had been open since 1971 - was sold and then closed. The family that had owned the Dubuque Inn also put their other property - the Days Inn - up for sale as well. Despite this, a number of hotel chains were still interested in establishing properties in Dubuque, and the Dubuque Inn has since been gutted and a portion of the original hotel building is being rebuilt as a Hampton Inn.\n\n"}

All other constituencies elected one member by first-past-the-post balloting.\n\nThis election was a watershed moment in Manitoba's political history. Since the formal introduction of partisan government in 1888, Manitoba had been governed alternately by the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party. Although the previous election of 1920 sustained the Liberals in power, it also saw the two-party dichotomy weakened by the rise of farmer and labour parliamentary blocs. In 1922, the old system was entirely swept away by the rise of the United Farmers of Manitoba (UFM).\n\nThe UFM had existed for several years as a farmer's organization, but some of its members ran as \"Independent-Farmers\" in the 1920 election. In 1921, however, the UFM announced it would field candidates during the 1922 campaign. The UFM was opposed to partisanship, and its most prominent members insisted that it was not a \"party\" in the traditional sense. UFM candidates often highlighted their lack of experience in partisan politics, and promised to govern the province in a restrained and responsible manner if elected to office.\n\nThe UFM membership was also heterogeneous. Although many supporters were free-trade agrarian Liberals before 1920, a number were also Conservatives. Some prominent UFM figures were also notable members of Manitoba's francophone community, which generally supported the Conservative Party before 1920.\n\nThe United Farmers fielded candidates in rural constituencies, and also endorsed candidates of the Progressive Association in Winnipeg. Even with these endorsements, the UFM operated on a shoestring budget, and was only able to field candidates in two-thirds of the ridings. However, in a major upset, the UFM and Progressives won 25 seats out of 52. Elections in three northern seats were deferred until later.\n\nNot even the UFM had expected to win government. Indeed, its expectations were so low that it had not had a formal leader during the campaign. Thus, when the UFM caucus met for the first time after the election, its first task was to choose a leader who would become the province's next premier. After Thomas Crerar and Robert Hoey declined the invitation to govern, the caucus turned to John Bracken, president of the Manitoba Agricultural College. Although he had no political experience, Bracken accepted the nomination. He ran in a deferred election in The Pas, and was duly elected. The UFM also won deferred elections in Ethelbert and Rupertsland, giving them a narrow majority in the legislature. The UFM's political arm branded itself as the Progressive Party of Manitoba.\n\nThe other parties fared poorly in the 1922 campaign. The Liberals, led by outgoing premier Tobias Norris, fell from twenty-one seats to eight. The Conservatives, under their newly chosen leader Fawcett Taylor, fell from eight seats to seven.\n\nThe Independent Labour Party also experienced difficulties. In the 1920 election, Manitoba's various left-wing and working-class groups submerged their differences to run a united campaign. This cooperation was successful, and eleven labour candidates were elected to form the second-largest parliamentary bloc. By the 1922 election, however, the Labour Party was beset by long-standing divisions among socialists, communists and conservative trade unionists.\n\nA total of thirteen labour candidates ran for ten seats in Winnipeg. Six were members of the ILP, and a seventh, former Social Democrat John Queen, ran as an \"Independent Workers\" candidate allied with the ILP. The other candidates were divided among themselves. The banned Communist Party ran three candidates under its legal front, the Workers Party. These candidates disrupted meetings of Socialist incumbent George Armstrong, and accused him of selling out his principles to moderates and social gospellers. Two conservative trade-unionists also ran as Union Labour candidates, opposing radicalism in the labour movement.\n\nFive ILP candidates were elected, and John Queen was also elected in Winnipeg. Labour leader Fred Dixon topped the poll in Winnipeg for a second time, although by a reduced margin from 1920. George Armstrong lost his Winnipeg seat, and no other labour candidates were elected. Six independent candidates were also elected.\n\nThe Progressives would go on to govern Manitoba alone until 1932, when they joined forces with the Liberals to form the \"Liberal-Progressive Party.\" The Liberal-Progressives would go on to govern Manitoba, either alone or in coalition, until 1959.\n\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" align=left|Party\n!rowspan=\"2\" align=left|Party leader\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Candidates\n!colspan=\"3\" align=center|Seats\n!colspan=\"5\" align=center|Popular vote\n\nFinal results for Winnipeg: Liberal 2, Conservative 2, ILP 3, Moderation League 1, Independent Worker 1, Progressive 1\nNote: Reports of vote tallies were incomplete for counts 32-36.

The winner of four Walkley Awards for his work, Pickering largely retired from political cartooning in the 1980s but returned to the field in 2011.\n\nPickering was born in Australia on 18 October 1942. Initially employed as a proofreader, Pickering was able to gain the attention of John Allan, the editor of \"The Canberra Times\". Allan gave Pickering the opportunity to work for the paper as a political cartoonist, and Pickering's early work coincided with the Whitlam and Fraser governments. It was at this time his first book of cartoons, \"The Hansard Papers\", written by Reuters Economic Services Canberra correspondent Michael Guy and illustrated by Pickering was published and went to No. 1 on the Australian bestseller lists.\n\nPickering was awarded two Walkley Awards with \"The Canberra Times\" for his work, one in 1971 and a second the following year in 1972. Pickering went on to win the award a further two times, in 1973 with \"The National Times\", and in 1974 with \"The Sydney Morning Herald\".\n\nIn 1976, Pickering moved to \"The Australian\", where his \"Jungle Series\" was featured in the newspaper's weekend edition. He remained with \"The Australian\" for five years, before largely retiring from political cartooning in 1981 – although he continued to publish the \"Pickering’s Playmates\" calendars, and some of his work continued to appear in \"The Bulletin\".\n\nFor the next thirty years Pickering focused on other pursuits, such as training racehorses and growing tomatoes, but in 2011 he returned to political cartooning. Publishing his cartoons online, Pickering became involved in political commentary through his blog \"The Pickering Post,\" where he ran a series of posts in 2012 attacking Prime Minister Julia Gillard over the AWU affair. Gillard responded by referring to the website as \"vile and sexist\", and described Pickering as a \"misogynist\".\n\nIn 2010, Pickering was made an undischarged bankrupt on petition from the father of his former de facto, but in reply denied he owed any money and stated his \"only asset is a $250 set of golf clubs\".\n\nPickering acknowledged he helped establish Cohen Strachan Investments, a betting software company which went into bankruptcy in 2010 with millions of dollars lost by gamblers. Pickering stated that he \"feels sorry for people who lost money\" but that he \"had nothing to do\" with the company. A private investigator employed by the gamblers presented a report to the Queensland Police and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission claiming ongoing links between the companies and Pickering, a claim he denied. In November 2015, Queensland Fraud Squad detectives reopened the investigation into Pickering's involvement in Cohen Strachan Investments. It was reported that police had interviewed him at his Gold Coast home.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Queensland found that Pickering derived \"significant financial benefits\" from Hamlyn Crest, the Australian distributor of the betting software, and that his denial of involvement in the management of the company was \"thoroughly implausible\".\n\nOn 10 February 2017, at a speech for the far-right Q Society, Pickering denounced Muslims and homosexuals, saying \"I can't stand Muslims. If they are in the same street as me, I start shaking. They are not all bad [because] they do chuck pillow-biters off buildings.\"\n\nPickering lived on the Gold Coast, Queensland. He had eleven children.\n\nPickering, a smoker, had lung cancer and had most of one lung removed in January 2016. After the operation, his doctors told him that he would be 'unlikely to survive to the end of 2016'. By 2018 Pickering was still posting on his blog, The Pickering Post.\n\nPickering died on the evening of 19 November 2018 at an Arundel Hospital, aged 76, with his wife and family at his side.\n\n\n"}

His gimmick was that of an adult entertainer/stripper, and he often wore eye-masks to the ring while carrying a pink umbrella. His character was immensely popular with women, and was instrumental in building a large female fanbase in Toryumon's early years. At the height of his popularity, women in the crowd would actually stuff money into his tights.\n\nKuroki initially retired in 2007 after a persistent eye injury, but briefly returned two years later for the Hustle promotion before retiring again in late 2009. Currently, Kuroki works as a Daido-juku Kudo trainer in both Japan and Colombia.\n\nMagnum Tokyo was a popular mainstay in Japan's Dragon Gate promotion. He was trained by Último Dragón and graduated from Dragon's \"Toryumon Gym\" in 1997, making his professional wrestling debut on May 11, 1997 by defeating fellow débutante Nobuhiko Oshima. After his first match he would become Magnum Tokyo and developed his character over the year. He would also make appearances for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre and International Wrestling Revolution Group. Magnum defeated Tony Rivera in the final of the Young Dragons Cup 1997. On July 5, he defeated El Hijo del Gladiador for the IWRG Intercontinental Middleweight Championship and held it for three months before losing it to Mr. Niebla.\n\nLess than a year into his professional career, he gained some mainstream notoriety in North America with World Championship Wrestling in early and mid-1998. While there, he participated in a brief program wherein he wanted to become a member of The Dancing Fools, (a tag team consisting of Disco Inferno and Alex Wright), and would appear dancing behind them (without their knowledge) during their entrance. The program came to a head when his interference backfired in a tag team match between The Dancing Fools and The Public Enemy at the 1998 Road Wild pay-per-view. Two nights later on the August 10 episode of \"Nitro\", he was told by Wright and Disco Inferno that if he wanted to be a member of The Dancing Fools, he needed to impress them in a match against Eddie Guerrero. He lost the match in under two minutes, and the match was his last appearance with the company until he returned briefly in October and November of that same year. During those two months, he appeared sporadically in squash matches and as a participant in the annual World War 3 battle royal on November 22, 1998. One night later (on the November 23 episode of \"Nitro\") he made his final televised appearance on WCW Nitro in a loss against Kanyon. He then appeared on WCW Saturday Night on December 5, 1998 in a segment with Barry Darsow where he got laid out.\n\nMagnum returned to Japan and made his debut for Toryumon Japan on January 31, 1999. Magnum participated in the NWA World Middleweight Title Tournament but lost in the finals to SASUKE. During his early years in Toryumon he would align himself with wrestlers such as Dragon Kid and Kenichiro Arai to combat the factions of Crazy MAX and M2K. In March and April 2001, Magnum took part in El Numero Uno and was placed into block A. With three points he progressed to the semi final and then eventually the final which took place on April 4. In the final he took on M2K leader Masaaki Mochizuki where the match would end in a double count out, therefore the match would restart and this time Mochizuki would come out on top. On July 1, 2001 he defeated Mochizuki for the British Commonwealth Junior Heavyweight Championship and on August 14, he, Dragon Kid and Ryo Saito won the UWA World Trios Championship from Crazy MAX. On October 28, the trio lost the title to M2K. On March 15, 2002, Magnum lost the British Commonwealth Junior Heavyweight Championship to SUWA. In 2002's El Numero Uno, Magnum would this time defeat Mochizuki. In a shocking turn of events, on May 19, Magnum joined M2K and became their leader, on that night he teamed up with Mochizuki in a one night tag team tournament where they were defeated by Crazy MAX. On September 8, Darkness Dragon was kicked out of M2K and went on to form Do Fixer with Dragon Kid and Ryo Saito. On October 28, Magnum dissolved M2K and announced that he and the remnants of M2K were the real Do FIXER, and that Darkness Dragon – now renamed K-ness – was still a member of the group and was sent into the home army (Seikigun) to cause problems within it. It worked in that Ryo Saito was not welcomed back into Seikigun, but Dragon Kid, however, was. In El Numero Uno 2003, Magnum only reached the quarter finals before losing to Genki Horiguchi. On June 29, Magnum defeated CIMA for the Último Dragón Gym Championship and would lose it to SUWA on February 8, 2004. From the end of 2003, there were problems between Magnum and the remaining stable members again and again and on March 27, 2005, Magnum appointed Ryo Saito as the new leader. On March 28, Magnum joined PoS.HEARTS but was still considered a member of Do FIXER. Magnums first title shot since Toryumon became Dragon Gate came on May 1, for the Open the Triangle Gate Championship against Do FIXER. Magnum took part in King Of Gate 2005 but was eliminated in the first round by Masaaki Mochizuki. Magnum would leave PoS.HEARTS and formed a new stable called Renaissance and was still considered a member of Do FIXER.\n\nOn August 26, 2006, Magnum and Mochizuki took part in the Dragon Gate I-J Heavyweight Tag Team Championship tournament and during the second round match up involving Don Fujii and Yasushi Kanda, although they won the match, Magnum's career was put into jeopardy after he suffered a very serious eye injury. After being out for seven months with little to no improvement to the condition of his eye, TOKYO announced his retirement in April 2007.\n\nOn November 20, 2008, Magnum returned to professional wrestling, appearing under a new gimmick, Detective Alan Kuroki, at a Hustle event in Tokyo, Japan. He wrestled his return match for HUSTLE on November 22, 2008. On March 25, 2009, he announced he would be returning to his Magnum Tokyo gimmick. After returning as Magnum Tokyo he would team up with TAJIRI. Magnum appeared at Hustle Jihad 2009 where he teamed with Akira Shoji, Rene Dupree, Shiro Koshinaka and Toshiaki Kawada and lost to Genichiro Tenryu, King RIKI, Riki Choshu, Wataru Sakata and Yoshihiro Takayama. Since the closure of HUSTLE, Magnum has stayed away from wrestling and is presumed retired.\n\n\n"}

It is owned and operated by the Dingmans Choice and Delaware Bridge Company.\nIn 1735, Andrew Dingman, a Dutch pioneer from Kinderhook, New York, operated a ferry that connected the Old Mine Road in Sussex County, New Jersey to the Bethany Turnpike (now U.S. Route 209) in Delaware Township in Pike County. The ferry thrived for over a century as pioneers utilized this important river crossing to move westward. Crossing on the ferry took some time; the ferryman on the western (Pennsylvania) bank had to be summoned by a bell on the eastern (New Jersey) shore. A house was built near the present-day bridge in 1803 by Judge Daniel W. Dingman, who was said to hold court in his bare feet. Still standing, the house is on the state and national historic registers.\n\nIn 1836, the first bridge was built by the Dingmans. Under the terms of its charter, churchgoers, schoolchildren, and funeral processions were given free passage, a condition that is still in effect today. The first bridge lasted until 1847 when high water washed away the Milford Bridge upstream and swept the debris into Dingman's Bridge.\n\nAfter a brief life, the second bridge was destroyed four or five years after the first, in a severe windstorm.\n\nA third bridge was constructed in 1856, but, being of poor quality, it fell apart by 1862. The ferry was operated once again by the Dingmans until the property was sold in 1875 to John W. Kilsby, Sr. Kilsby's family operated the ferry until the turn of the twentieth century when the current bridge was constructed using some materials recycled from a railroad bridge on the Susquehanna River. This bridge has survived major floods in 1903, 1955, 2005, and 2006.\n\nDingman named his original plot of land Dingman's Choice. The village of Dingman's Choice, which became quite identified with the ferry, had its name changed by the Post Office to Dingmans Ferry in 1868. Records from an early log book show tolls of 40 cents for a horseless carriage, 25 cents for a two-horse wagon, 10 cents for a horse and rider, 5 cents for a bicycle, and 2 cents for a footman. Under the terms of the original charter, no toll was charged for individuals traveling to church or a funeral, a custom which is still practiced presently.\n\nToday, the bridge provides an important link for commuters to reach destinations in New Jersey and New York City. The bridge lies south of the current Milford–Montague Toll Bridge, and well north of the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge along Interstate 80. As such, it is in a location which caters well to the commuter lifestyle of many area residents of Delaware Township, Dingman Township, and other surrounding communities.\n\nThe toll for automobiles is $1.00. Books of 40 tickets can be purchased from the toll collector for $30.00 as of April 20, 2015. This effectively lowers the toll to 75 cents if the entire book is used. Bicyclists may cross for free, but pedestrians are not allowed due to the narrow lanes. An height restriction coupled with a weight restriction of four tons precludes large RVs and trucks from crossing. Although the bridge is within the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, government employees pay the toll, unless responding to an emergency with lights and sirens on. The bridge is the only fixed-crossing that charges a toll to enter New Jersey.\n\nThe bridge's toll booth, located on the Pennsylvania side, is staffed by a single toll collector who stands in between the two lanes of traffic, collecting toll fees by hand. Christmas Day is the only day of the year on which the toll booth is unattended; everyone may cross for free.\n\nBecause the Bridge Company is responsible for its own repairs, it employs an engineering firm certified for bridge inspection to regularly and thoroughly inspect the bridge from the tops of the trusses to the underwater foundations. Each year, the bridge company closes the bridge the second week after Labor Day to conduct any repairs needed to maintain the structural integrity of the bridge and to replace or flip the salt-treated British Columbia fir planks. These floor boards are held in place with anchor plates and collar nails which results in a characteristic rattling of the deck with the traffic moving.\n\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}

The alto, tenor, and bass voices sing free counterpoint, while the sopranos sing the chorale unadorned in long notes. Philipp Spitta described the sound of this movement as a \"church-yard full of flowers in the springtime\". The setting has a \"popular\" sound because of the use of 12/8 time and the unique nature of the accompaniment figures: plucked arpeggios, bell tones, and \"sinuous\" or \"lazy\" patterns.\n\nThe tenor aria is characterized by continued bell tones and string pizzicato in the accompaniment, and a duet with oboe for the vocal line. The following alto recitative \"brings forth a bit of the terror of death\", in contrast with the \"amazingly jolly\" aria in \"jig tempo\" that follows. The soprano recitative leads into a \"marching\" chorale setting to end the cantata.\n\nAn alternative version of the cantata in D major is also extant, believed to be from 1746–47. Several minor changes to the instrumentation were also implemented; for example, in the first movement the two oboe parts are given to concertante violins, and in the bass aria, the oboe d'amore is used colla parte with the flute. Both variants have been recorded: the aria by Ton Koopman with Klaus Mertens as the bass soloist and the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra, and the chorus by Koopman's pupil Masaaki Suzuki and the Bach Collegium Japan in addition to the full cantata in E major.\n\nThe selection is taken from the listing on the Bach Cantatas Website.\n\n"}

Most (though not all) peace pagodas built since World War II have been built under the guidance of Nichidatsu Fujii (1885–1985), a Buddhist monk from Japan and founder of the Nipponzan-Myōhōji Buddhist Order. Fujii was greatly inspired by his meeting with Mahatma Gandhi in 1931 and decided to devote his life to promoting non-violence. In 1947, he began constructing Peace Pagodas as shrines to world peace. The first was inaugurated at Kumamoto in 1954.\n\nPeace Pagodas were built as a symbol of peace in Japanese cities including Hiroshima and Nagasaki where the atomic bombs took the lives of over 150,000 people, almost all of whom were civilian, at the end of World War II.

Written by Francis Scott Key, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" is the national anthem of the United States. The musical arrangement for Whitney Houston's rendition was by conductor John Clayton. The recording was produced by music coordinator Rickey Minor, along with Houston herself. The recording was included in the 2014 CD/DVD release, \"\" and the US edition of the 2000 release, \"\".\n\nTraditionally performed at sports games in the US, \"The Star Spangled Banner\" was performed by Houston at the original Tampa Stadium for Super Bowl XXV in 1991. Houston donated her portion of the proceeds.\n\nAfter the September 11, 2001 attacks, Arista Records re-released Houston's \"The Star Spangled Banner\". She once again donated her share of the royalties, as did Arista Records, towards the firefighters and victims of the terrorist attacks. This time the single peaked at #6 on the US Hot 100, and was certified platinum by the RIAA. This made Houston the first musical act to take the national anthem Top 10 in the US, and have it certified platinum. The 2001 re-release of the single was Houston's last Top Ten hit on the US Hot 100 during her lifetime.\n\nOn Election Day 1990, when Whitney Houston was announced as the performer of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at Super Bowl XXV, Houston knew instantly how she wanted to interpret the tune there—with jazz chords and soulful gospel rhythms. So, her longtime musical director Rickey Minor suggested changing the song from standard, waltz tempo— time signature—to , with the extra beat per measure allowing Houston to open up her lungs and 'breathe'. Two weeks before the Super Bowl, Houston heard the arrangement, played by The Florida Orchestra and recorded at Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center earlier in January, for the first time. And about ten days later, she recorded a breathtaking game-day master at a California studio. Minor recalled that she truly embraced the song. But not everybody agreed. Some National Football League (NFL) officials feared the rendition was too flamboyant for wartime. Minor told \"USA Today\" that \"They thought the harmonies were too different, that it was sacrilegious.\" Bob Best, the Super Bowl's pregame show producer since the early 1980s, added that \"Their hang-up was that it wasn't easy to sing to. I disagreed wholeheartedly.\" Four days before the game, NFL officials ordered Best to phone Houston's father, John, and ask if she would record another version. The answer was no. Best said that \"I held that phone so far away from my ear.\" Yet, when Houston stepped onto the field, Minor was filled with anxiety: \"I thought, 'What if everybody boos?'\" Two weeks later, the single was a big hit on the \"Billboard\" charts.\n\nOn January 27, 1991—ten days into the Persian Gulf War—Whitney Houston took the field at Tampa Stadium and performed \"The Star Spangled Banner\", backed by the Florida Orchestra along with music director Jahja Ling, before 73,813 fans, 115 million viewers in the United States and a worldwide television audience of 750 million. The pregame program including Houston's performance of the national anthem was produced by Bob Best for the National Football League and televised live on American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States. Because of the Gulf War situation, this marked the first time the Super Bowl would be telecast in most countries around the world. Outside of North America and the United Kingdom, the Super Bowl was broadcast for the first time in such countries as Australia, Russia, and most other countries. Houston's performance was later used as a music video of the song.\n\nThe patriotic feeling of Houston's stirring cover resonated strongly with the public. Due to overwhelming response to her rendition, Arista Records announced that it was released as a single and video of her performance, and all profits would be donated to a charity connected with the war effort, to be selected by Houston at a later date. Afterward Houston said that \"I went back up in the sky booth and watched the game. It wasn't until a day or two later that I realized the whole country was in an uproar.\" According to Clive Davis, Arista Records' decision to release the record came after three days of being flooded with phone calls from all over the country from people asking to buy copies of the single. Hundreds of radio stations around the country aired the song from tapes they had recorded from the TV broadcast. Eventually, the CDs, records and audio cassettes of the performance were released on February 12, and its video singles on February 17, 1991 in the United States by Arista Records, respectively. And the proceeds―$531,650, a combined contribution from the Whitney Houston Foundation for Children, Inc., Arista and Bertelsmann Music Group Distribution which donated all their royalties and profits from the sale of those―went to the American Red Cross Gulf Crisis Fund, which provided aid to US military personnel, their families and war victims in the region. Houston was named to the American Red Cross Board of Governors. The audio single was also released in some countries including the Netherlands but its shipments were very small.\n\nOn May 16, 2000, the song and its video were released on CD, VHS and DVD of her \"\". The song was only included in the domestic version of the album.\n\nAccording to Arista, Houston, who had been in the process of picking songs for the upcoming album with then Arista CEO L.A. Reid before September 11 attacks, shortly after the attack, decided to do her part to help the country recover by agreeing to have her 1991 rendition of \"The Star Spangled Banner\" re-released. So, it was reissued as a commercial CD single on September 26, 2001 by Arista Records, with proceeds going to the New York Firefighters 9/11 Disaster Relief Fund and the New York Fraternal Order of Police; the single also included her version of \"America the Beautiful.\" With releasing of the single, Reid said that \"In a time of tragedy, Whitney Houston's recording of our National Anthem has comforted and inspired our nation.\"\n\nHouston's rendition of \"The Star Spangled Banner\" has garnered unanimous acclaim since her performance and has been cited as a benchmark for the performances of its kind. Hubert Mizell of \"St. Petersburg Times\" lauded her to the skies, saying \"Whitney Houston brought down the house as the lady with the super pipes sang the Super Bowl's most meaningful national anthem ever.\" Liz Smith from \"Newsday\" called the performance \"[a] magnificent rendition,\" commenting \"Her [Houston's] powerhouse version [...] turned that often impossible-to-sing tune into a hit.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\"s Jess Cagle noted the specific circumstances, particularly a patriotic mood at the time, rather than the performance itself, stating that \"Her [Houston's] timing couldn't be better: patriotism, thanks to the Iraqi war, is high, and Francis Scott Key's 1814 ode to the flag is about to celebrate its 60th anniversary as our national anthem. The Gulf war fervor has turned Houston's performance into an unlikely, overnight pop hit.\" Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" said that Houston's rendition represented the image which the war was recast as sexy and exhilarating in the 1990s, becoming a counterpart to Jimi Hendrix's at Woodstock in 1969, with screaming siren notes and blasts of feedback that suggested the chaos and carnage of Vietnam bombing raids. He was critical of the media which used Houston's performance as a means of allowing the public to forget the violence of war, and the public's unquestioning acceptance of that, stating \"'The Star-Spangled Banner' memorializes 'bombs bursting in air,' and the quiver in Ms. Houston's voice finds seductiveness in the rockets' red glare. But so far, despite the gleaming high-tech weapons paraded on the nightly news, the pop public hasn't joined her. For the moment, it is keeping its distance and hoping the worst will be over soon.\"\n\nDeborah Wilker of \"South Florida Sun-Sentinel\" commented that Houston's version was a \"moving rendition\" and \"imaginative arrangement\" of the national anthem, adding \"The rare moment on the football field showed her to be much more than a hit machine.\" Jim Farber, a music critic of \"New York Daily News\", in his review of Houston's 2000 album \"Whitney: The Greatest Hits\", said the song was \"bold enough to launch a thousand ships.\" Sportswriter Dave Anderson of \"The New York Times\" commented that \"When Whitney Houston belted out the national anthem with the nation at war, she reminded everybody that there was a much more important world out there beyond the Super Bowl, a much more important world beyond even the Giants' hold-your-breath triumph when Bills kicker Scott Norwood's 47-yard field goal try sailed wide right.\" \"Los Angeles Times\"s J.A. Adande, a sports columnist, commented that \"It dripped red, white and blue,\" placing Houston's Super Bowl performance at number three on his list for the best renditions of \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" In February 2003, \"Vibe\", in a feature article in honor of Super Bowl XXVII, wrote that Houston's performance was \"sweet, sweaty and sensational,\" choosing it as \"Most Kleenex-Worthy Performance.\" In 2005, \"Orlando Sentinel\"s Emily Badger, in her articles of the national anthem, picked Houston's rendition of the song as the first of the three good performances along with Marvin Gaye's at the 1983 NBA All-Star Game, and Natalie Gilbert and Maurice Cheeks's in 2003 NBA playoffs, saying a word of praise: \"Whitney Houston [...] was so good it sold successfully as a single.\" Janet Mock of \"People\" magazine extolled her performance that \"Houston gave one of the most iconic interpretations of the National Anthem in history.\" Writing for MTV.com in February 2009, Gil Kaufman said the song is a \"legendary take on the National Anthem.\" Luchina Fisher and Sheila Marikar of ABC News, in their articles of lip-syncing, wrote that \"Houston's unforgettable rendition of the anthem [...] set the standard that most singers have tried to top.\" Jenny Mayo of \"The Washington Times\", in her review of Houston's 2009 album \"I Look to You\", praised the rendition highly: \"Miss Houston is an artist who can—or at least used to—make songs untouchable. 'The Star Spangled Banner' will never be the same.\" Bill Lamb from About.com expressed that \"[Houston's] formidable power made her Super Bowl XXV 'Star Spangled Banner' performance a legendary moment,\" and on her biography by Lamb, also described it \"as one of the most stunning televised performances ever.\" Monica Herrera of \"Billboard\" called Houston's performance an \"epic take\", adding \"[Houston] made it memorable.\"\n\nRushelle O'Shea of Yahoo! Sports called it \"the most beautiful and most moving to have ever been performed at a sporting event\" and recalled then \"Leaving the crowd with tears in their eyes, she moved the hearts of many and received a well-earned standing ovation for this beautiful performance,\" choosing the performance as one of 'The Top 10 Greatest Sports Songs of All Time'. While commenting on Christina Aguilera's performance of the national anthem at Super Bowl XLV, \"The Christian Science Monitor\"s Peter Grier drew comparisons between Houston's version and Aguilera's, writing \"One thing is sure: She [Aguilera] was no Whitney Houston. Remember Ms. Houston’s performance of 'The Star-Spangled Banner' at the Super Bowl in 1991? Houston [...] gave an emotional rendition of the song, and it remains one of her career highlights.\" \"The Oxford Student\"s Abbas Panjwani wrote that \"Houston’s version is totally euphoric and boundless in energy. Nothing overly fancy. Just immense vocal talent.\" Chris Willman from Yahoo! Music complimented on Houston's version of the song that it \"hasn't aged\" and \"may remain the most highly regarded version of our lifetimes,\" ranked second in his 'The 10 Best National Anthems Ever' list. Mike Vaccaro of \"New York Post\" recalled the performance that \"Not only because she [Houston] was at her peak that January of 1991, not only because we were at war, but she hits the final note ('brave') in a different way than almost anyone else who’s ever tried to sing it, and it is unforgettable,\" choosing it as his all time number-one favorite among the national anthems. Both Jack Yacks and Gary Mills of \"The Florida Times-Union\" described the song as \"the gold standard for national anthem performances.\" In March 2011, \"St. Petersburg Times\" Tom Jones, in his article of memorable sporting events in Tampa Bay Area, recalled the Super Bowl XXV as follows: \"the game was about more than football. The United States was embroiled in the first Gulf War, and Whitney Houston, right, backed by the Florida Orchestra, produced goose bumps and tears with a powerful rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner. It is one of the great Super Bowl moments.\"\n\nWhitney Houston's rendition of \"The Star Spangled Banner\" at Super Bowl XXV was released as a single in the United States alone on February 12, 1991 during the Gulf War. The single debuted at number 32 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Singles chart, the issue dated of March 9, 1991, becoming her highest first week chart entry at the time and the first rendition of the national anthem to appear on the chart since 1968, when José Feliciano's version during Game 5 pregame ceremonies of the 1968 World Series, climbed to number 50. Her previous highest debut on the chart had been when \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\" entered the Hot 100 chart some six places lower at number 38 in May 1987. The following week it leaped to number 25, two weeks later peaked at number 20 on the chart in the March 30, 1991 issue, making Houston the first and only artist to hit the Top 20 with the national anthem since 1958, when the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart was published first, and spent a total of 11 weeks on the chart. The single was certified Gold for shipments of 500,000 copies and the video single was 2× Platinum for shipping of 100,000 units, respectively, by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on April 11, 1991. \"The Star Spangled Banner\" became the fastest-selling single in Arista's history at the time, with 750,000 copies sold in the first eight days.\n\nThanks to re-entering the Hot 100 Airplay list at number 45 with 30 million listeners, Houston's 1991 Super Bowl version of \"The Star Spangled Banner\" re-visited the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart at number 50, with the marks for Gold certification and 12 weeks on, the issue date of September 29, 2001. It also debuted for the first time on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart at number 54 in the same week. On its first week of retail release, the song re-entered the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Singles Sales chart at number two, and the following week topped the chart in the October 20 issue, becoming her third chart-topper, after \"I Will Always Love You\" in 1992 and \"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\" in 1995. In the same week, the single reached number 13 and a peak of number 30, on the Hot 100 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart, respectively. On the \"Billboard\" October 27, 2001 issue, Houston set another historic Hot 100 record with \"The Star Spangled Banner\" which reached number six on the chart. She became the first and only artist to make the national anthem Top 10 hit since 1958, when \"Billboard\" premiered the Hot 100 chart, and the third overall in music history, following Margaret Woodrow Wilson who hit number seven with it in 1915 and Irish tenorJohn McCormack who made the tune number one in 1917. It stayed on the chart for a total of 27 weeks, combined a fresh-16-weeks with 1991's 11 weeks. The single gave an impressive performance on the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart, spending six weeks on the top of the chart from October 20 to November 24, 2001 and 94 weeks on the chart by May 2003. In October 2001, RIAA certified it Platinum for shipments of 1,000,000 copies, making it Houston's seventh Platinum single. According to Nielsen SoundScan, as of 2007, it sold 1,200,000 copies in the US alone.\n\nAs the single was released in some countries in 1991, it failed to make the pop charts outside of the United States. In 2001, however, the single surprisingly debuted a peak of number five on the Canadian SoundScan Singles chart for the week dated November 11, 2001.\n\nIn the days following Houston's performance of the national anthem at Super Bowl XXV, a controversy arose when it was reported that she lip-synched to her own pre-recorded version of the song.\n\nAccounts of the performance vary. Bob Best, an NFL pre-game entertainment official, stated that the NFL chose to air a pre-recorded version of the song because \"we felt there were too many risks to do it live.\" In an interview with the \"New York Post\", Best said that what was played was \"protection copy\" (music recorded in advance to be used in the event of the singer's last-minute inability to sing) recorded by Houston several days before the game at an L.A. studio. In a February 4, 1991 article, Mary Jo Melone wrote: \"It was the Memorex. The singing and music you heard were prerecorded.\"\n\nDan Klores, a spokesman for Houston, explained \"This is not a Milli Vanilli thing; she sang, but the microphone was turned off. It was a technical decision, partially based on the noise factor. This is standard procedure at these events.\" In 2001, Kathryn Holm McManus, former executive director of the orchestra, told the \"St. Petersburg Times\" that \"everyone was playing, and Whitney was singing, but there were no live microphones. Everyone was lip-synching or finger-synching\". Rickey Minor, who was Houston's musical director in 1991, confirmed in 2012 that while Houston had sung the anthem live, the audience had heard a pre-recorded version of the song.\n\nIn slight contrast, Super Bowl engineer Larry Estrin told \"USA Today\" in 1991 that TV viewers actually heard the studio version of the song \"plus her live voice, plus the audience reaction\". Estrin added, \"She sang the melody and words the same way (as the studio version), but she sang her heart out.\"\n\nHowever, Houston's personal publicist, Regina Brown, said, \"Our understanding is Whitney sang live into a live microphone\".\n\nMary Jo Melone commented, \"This was the nation's most precious piece of music sung by one of its best performers at a most precarious time. If we were going to make such a deal of the moment, for the troops in Saudi Arabia, we should have heard the real thing. Or at least we should have been told we weren't.\" Songwriter and producer Jimmy Jam, in a 2004 interview with \"The Associated Press\", said, \"Whitney, when she did the national anthem, which was the greatest national anthem that we ever heard, what we heard over the air was prerecorded. The reason it was prerecorded was, that was a moment that no one wanted any mistakes. They didn't want any feedback, they didn't want any technical difficulties ... and it was great.\"\n\nIn later years, when controversies arose involving lip-syncing by performers, Houston's Super Bowl performance was sometimes mentioned. When Jennifer Hudson delivered a lip-syncing of \"The Star Spangled Banner\" at Super Bowl XLIII in February 2009, it caused some controversy. David Hinckley of \"New York Daily News\" remarked, \"The national anthem is different. Yes, it's a musical performance and yes, we're interested in how a Jennifer Hudson will interpret the song. That's why we remember the Whitney Houston and Marvin Gaye versions so well. Because the Super Bowl is primarily a television spectacle with a thousand moving parts, the producers years ago started asking to hear the anthem tracks a week before airtime, just so they would have one less potential variable. That's why [Jennifer Hudson] was lip-syncing.\"\n\nThe Florida Orchestra's contribution to the performance was virtually ignored by the public and the media. That did not cause a problem until the performance was determined to release as a single and donate any proceeds to a war-related charity by Arista Records. Although Ashley Sanford, a representative of Arista in New York, said everyone associated with the performance had been consulted before announcing plans for the recording, the plan came as a surprise to the orchestra. Kathryn Holm, then acting executive director for the orchestra, told \"St. Petersburg Times\" that \"We were informed indirectly. We had heard something about it. But we didn't know anything had been decided.\" Arranger John Clayton was surprised as well, saying \"I had heard some talk something might happen.\" Unlike Clayton, who was paid for his work, the orchestra was paid only for its expenses. The musicians and music director Jahja Ling donated their services. According to Holm, their contract gave permission only for a single broadcast of the performance. Holm said \"I'm not an expert in this, so I don't know whether the radio or television stations have permission to broadcast it or not.\" The orchestra's original contract with the NFL, signed December in 1990, didn't even mention subsequent releases. Holm demanded proper compensation from Arista for the contribution of the orchestra, then faced financial trouble and wanted a share of any profits from its Super Bowl performance, telling the \"Times\" that \"Nobody anticipated the reaction, but part of the anthem's impact came from the arrangement behind it, so we believe our musicians deserve some restitution.\" Eventually, the orchestra received royalty payments in 1991 and 1992 of about $100,000, the \"St. Petersburg Times\" reported.\n\nOn December 14, 2001, the Florida Orchestra sued Arista Records for royalties from copies of the song re-released after Sept. 11 and placed on a Whitney Houston Greatest Hits album and videocassette. Leonard Stone, then orchestra executive director, said \"It is a pity that we have to go to court on something so honorable and uplifting as the national anthem. [...] I suspect that Whitney Houston, if she knew, would be deeply hurt and offended as well. She was a friend of the orchestra,\" filing the lawsuit in Hillsborough Circuit Court asked a judge to enforce the terms of a 1991 agreement that requires Arista to pay the orchestra royalties on all sales worldwide of her rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" Under the agreement, the orchestra would get royalties of 5 percent on the suggested retail price of all copies of the song sold in the United States. The royalties would range from 2.5 to 4.25 percent in foreign countries. According to Stone, Arista was supposed to send the orchestra quarterly reports on the album's sales but the orchestra never received them, and no one at the orchestra knew that Houston's rendition of the song had been released in 2000 on her greatest hits album. Stone added that \"the orchestra learned of the alleged contract breach after the anthem was reissued following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and quickly became a hot-selling single.\" Following the song's release after Sept. 11, orchestra attorney Frank Jakes began looking into the issue. Jakes, who negotiated the agreement with Arista in 1991, said that he sent Arista's general counsel letters and faxes but got no response, recalling how unwilling Arista had been to pay the orchestra a decade ago. However, thanks to both sides' efforts for resolution of the dispute, three days later (December 17, 2001), the suit was withdrawn by the orchestra voluntarily. The Arista spokesperson said \"it was an administrative oversight from [Houston's] Greatest Hits album.\" An Arista representative assured Jakes who claimed that the non-profit organization had not received quarterly royalty statements since mid-1992, that the issue could be settled without legal action.\n\nBefore her famous rendition of \"The Star Spangled Banner\" at Super Bowl XXV in 1991, Whitney Houston sang the national anthem several times in sports events, such as:\n\nBeyoncé Knowles, who performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004, referred to Houston's Super Bowl anthem as a big influence on her, talking about the experience on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", originally aired on April 5, 2004: \"Even more so than the Grammys, singing The Star-Spangled Banner, the national anthem, has always been a dream. [As a child,] I watched Whitney Houston, and I literally was in tears. And I grew up saying, ‘Mom, I’m going to do that.’…I actually did it! It was overwhelming. It was amazing, it really was.\"\n\nLady Gaga, in an exclusive interview with CNN-IBN, answered the question about her mention of Houston's name in her Grammy award acceptance speech in 2011 that \"Whitney was my major vocal inspiration when I was young. We used to listen to her rendition of 'The Star Spangled Banner' over and over again. She has an angel in her throat, and I promised myself that the first time I win a Grammy that I would thank Whitney on TV. I did that last year too, but that was not on TV. So this year I had to thank her again.\"\n\n\nCredits adapted from \"The Star Spangled Banner\" single liner notes.\n\"The Star Spangled Banner\"\n\n\"America the Beautiful\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2261655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2261655", "title": "Yasuni National Park", "text": "Yasuni National Park\n\nYasuni National Park () is in Ecuador with an area of 9,823 km between the Napo and Curaray Rivers in Napo and Pastaza Provinces in Amazonian Ecuador. The national park lies within the Napo moist forests ecoregion and is primarily rain forest. The park is about 250 km from Quito and was designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1989. It is within the claimed ancestral territory of the Huaorani indigenous people. Yasuni is also home to two uncontacted indigenous tribes, the Tagaeri and the Taromenane. Many indigenous people use the riverways within the park as a main mode of travel. Several waterways in the area are tributaries that lead into the Amazon River, including blackwater rivers high in tannins boasting vastly different floral composition than the main riverways. The spine-covered palm, \"Bactris\" \"riparia,\" and aquatic plant \"Montrichardia linifera\" typically line the edges of these slow moving rivers, often referred to as Igapós.\n\nYasuni National Park (YNP) is arguably the most biologically diverse spot on Earth and a convergence point for three unique regions, the Equator, Andes Mountains, and the Amazon rainforest. The park is at the center of a small zone where amphibian, bird, mammal, and vascular plant diversity all reach their maximum levels within the western hemisphere. Moreover, the park breaks world records for local-scale (less than 100 km) tree, amphibian, and bat species richness, and is one of the richest spots in the world for birds and mammals at local scales as well. The park also harbors a lot of amphibian diversity compared to other sites sampled in the western Amazon. Reptile species in the park are also very high in diversity with 121 documented species found. In spite of covering less than 0.15% of the Amazon Basin, Yasuni is home to approximately one-third of amphibian and reptile species. The park also harbors high levels of fish diversity with 382 known species. Yasuni is also home to at least 596 bird species which comprises one-third of the total native bird species for the Amazon. The park is also rich in species of bats. On a regional scale, the Amazon Basin has an estimated 117 bat species, but on a local scale, Yasuni is estimated to have comparable richness. In a single hectare, Yasuni has over 100,000 different species of insects which is roughly the amount of insect species that can be found in all of North America. The park also boasts one of the world's richest levels of vascular plants. It is one of nine places in the world that has over 4,000 vascular plant species per 10,000 km. The park contains many species of trees and shrubs and holds at least four world records for documented tree and liana richness as well as three world records for diversity in woody plant species. The park also hosts a list endemic species such as 43 different species of vertebrates and 220–720 different plant species. Moreover, the park breaks world records for local-scale (less than 100 km2) tree, amphibian, and bat species richness, and is one of the richest spots in the world for birds and mammals at local scales as well. Within the northwest region of the park is a Forest Dynamics Plot, a 50 hectare research plot created in 1995 by a collaboration between Pontificia Universidad Católica de Ecuador (PUCE), the Aarhus University in Denmark, and ForestGEO-STRI.\nMany types of mammals live within the national park both in water, on land, and in the air. \"Pteronura\" \"brasiliensis\", commonly known as the Giant Otter, an endangered species endemic to rivers in and surrounding the national park, are forced to adjust to constant seasonal changes in water levels that concurrently alter food availability. A species of bat, \"Lophostoma yasuni\", is endemic to the park, and the Amazon Basin has an estimated 117 bat species, but on a local scale, Yasuni is estimated to have comparable richness. Many species of monkey spend their lives coexisting among the tops of the canopy, including the Eastern Ecuadorian Squirrel (\"Saimiri cassiquiarensis\"), Pygmy marmoset (\"Cebuella pygmaea\"), Ecuadorian White-Fronted Capuchin (\"Cebus aequatorialis\"), Red-crowned Titi (\"Plecturocebus discolor\"), Napo saki (\"Pithecia napensis\"), Colombian Red Howler (\"Alouatta seniculus\"), White-Bellied Spider Monkey (\"Ateles belzebuth\"), and Brown Woolly Monkey (\"Lagothrix lagothricha\"). These creatures are key components to many trophic levels of the ecosystem as they serve as seed dispersers and remove insects from plants for nourishment.\n\nIn spite of covering less than 0.15% of the Amazon Basin, Yasuni is home to approximately one-third of the amphibian and reptile species. The park holds a world record 150 amphibian species for places with comparable landscapes, and high amphibian diversity compared to other sites sampled in the western Amazon. Treefrog \"Osteocephalus yasuni\" is named after the park. Reptile species in the park are also very high with 121 documented species found.\n\nThe park harbors high levels of fish diversity, boasting an estimated 500 species. However, this may be an underestimate of the amount of species actually present due to cryptic diversity, differences not easily seen morphologically but revealed using DNA studies, amongst species. The diversity of fish species in this region is influenced by seasonality and habitat, which is important for consideration when trying to capture the breadth of species encompassed in the waterways.\n\nYasuni is also home to at least 596 bird species which comprises one-third of the total native bird species for the Amazon. According to a field guide composed by PUCE, the area surrounding the Yasuni Scientific Research Station contain a large diversity of bird species including various predatory birds like falcons, hawks, and eagles and other birds such as macaws, antwrens, manakins, thrushes, and many other species. The diverse levels of canopy available have supported many different lifestyles for birds, including pollinators like hummingbirds who can often share close relation with certain plant groups.\n\nThis national park hosts very high levels of insect diversity and insect-plant mutualisms. In a single hectare, Yasuni has over 100,000 different species of insects which is roughly the amount of insect species that can be found in all of North America.Plant Diversity\n\nThe park also boasts one of the world's richest levels of vascular plants. It is one of nine places in the world that has over 4,000 vascular plant species per 10,000 km2. The park contains many species of trees and shrubs and holds at least four world records for documented tree and liana richness as well as three world records for diversity in woody plant species. Several recent book publications in coordination with PUCE have provided comprehensive information about plant species within the Yasuni region, one of which details 337 plants, predominantly trees, endemic to the Yasuni Region. The park also hosts a list endemic species such as 43 different species of vertebrates and 220–720 different plant species.\n\nYasuni National Park is home to an estimated 1.7 billion barrels of crude oil - 40 percent of Ecuador's reserves – in the Ishpingo-Tiputini-Tambococha (ITT) oil fields. Environmentalists and scientists such as Jane Goodall, E.O. Wilson, and Stuart Pimm urged the government to leave the resources untapped. Indigenous people and environmentalists called for a national referendum on the issue. This referendum called the Yasuní-ITT Initiative was enacted in 2007, and by 2009 pledges of support from around the world came to around 1.7 billion dollars. In response, President Rafael Correa launched the Yasuní-ITT Initiative to protect the park's natural resources in June 2007. The initiative promised to leave the park undisturbed in exchange for compensation from the international community. Not drilling in the park would prevent 400 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from entering the air, officials said. The government hoped to generate funds of at least 50 percent of the profits that it would receive were it to utilize the oil reserves. In total it hoped that US$3.6 billion would be raised over 12 years. At the time, the plan was hailed by environmentalists as a precedent setting decision that would reduce the burden of environmental preservation on the world's poorer countries.\n\nActors Leonardo DiCaprio and Edward Norton, filmmaker and global ecological activist/scientist Michael Charles Tobias, and former Vice President of the United States Al Gore were among those who pledged support to the Ecuadorian government. Countries contributing funds included Turkey, Chile, Colombia, Georgia, Australia, Spain and Belgium. However, fundraising efforts were inhibited by Ecuador's insistence that the government alone would decide how any funds raised were spent.\n\nIn July 2013, Correa formed a commission to evaluate the Yasuni-ITT initiative's progress to date. The commission concluded that the economic results were not sufficient. On August 15, Correa scrapped the plan citing poor follow-through from the international community. \"The world has failed us\", he said, calling the world's richest countries hypocrites who emit most of the world's greenhouse gases while expecting nations like his to sacrifice economic progress for the environment. Through an executive order, he liquidated the Yasuni-ITT trust fund formally ending the initiative. During the six-year history of the initiative, only US$336 million had been pledged, Correa said (in contrast to the $1.6 billion stated in the report cited above), and of that only US$13.3 million had actually been delivered.\nCorrea also said he had commissioned economic, legal, and technical studies on drilling in the region in preparation for the national assembly formally opening the park to drilling. He said expanding Ecuador's oil production was essential to furthering his economic projects that have won him widespread support among the nation's poor. He said the drilling would affect only 1% of the Yasuni basin. A spokesperson said the drilling could be conducted without damaging the environment. Environmentalists strongly objected to opening the park to oil exploration. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the presidential palace after Correa's announcement. The money pledged insured that it would be possible to fund the initiative, with support from the international community. Oil production accounts for one-third of Ecuador's national budget.\n\nColonization, deforestation, illegal logging, and unsustainable hunting are affecting the park at present.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the main route serving Blackburn Hamlet and south Orleans, as well as several industrial and commercial areas in east Ottawa. This road has changed considerably over the years.\n\nThe western section from St. Laurent Boulevard to Cyrville Road is a four-lane principal arterial road that primarily runs through industrial and light commercial areas with partial access control, although with an speed limit. Some residential frontage and considerable commercial frontage exists in the fairly congested section east of Highway 417, where Innes widens to six lanes up to Blackburn Hamlet and then becomes a divided four-lane road. The Canadian Conservation Institute is located in this section.\n\nInnes splits in Blackburn Hamlet; The original alignment runs through the community as an undivided road with a lower speed limit of . On both stretches of road, it is very common to get caught by speed traps. The long Blackburn Bypass (Ottawa Road 128) was built in the late 1980s; it is a divided expressway around Blackburn Hamlet maintaining , greatly speeding up the commute to Orléans.\n\nOnce in Orléans, Innes once again becomes a commercial/mixed frontage principal arterial road. This was recently widened from two to four lanes due to the urban sprawl of south Orleans. The most congested section is at 10th Line Road, which has become the second commercial hub of Orleans (after Place d'Orleans). The speed limit through Orleans is although during the construction project it was reduced mostly to .\n\nOnce clear of Orléans (east of Frank Kenny Road), Innes becomes a rural road.\n\n\nThe present Innes Road stretches to the Cumberland boundary and was originally called the 3rd Line. When the road was remade much of it ran north of, and parallel to, the original roadway. Part of the original road that still survives is now named Windmill Lane and runs to Ritchie’s Feed and Seed Store and past other businesses. Some changes to the road were necessitated by the construction of Highway 417.\nInnes was named after Alexander Innes, a Scottish immigrant who owned a farm close to the present day intersection of Innes and Bantree Road. He operated the Toll Road (Russell Road) which ran east from St. Laurent Blvd.\nAlexander Innes was father to John Innes who was Reeve of the Township of Gloucester and died in office. A monument to John Innes was erected at the corner of Russell Road and Walkley Road in 1941, but was not maintained and it was removed when Gloucester was amalgamated into Ottawa. In Fall 2013, a new cairn with a commemorative plaque was placed in front of Gloucester Hall on Bank Street.\n\n"}
{"id": "2261678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2261678", "title": "WLUK-TV", "text": "WLUK-TV\n\nWLUK-TV, virtual and VHF digital channel 11, is a Fox-affiliated television station licensed to Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States. The station is owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, as part of a duopoly with Suring-licensed CW affiliate WCWF (channel 14). The two stations share studios on Lombardi Avenue (US 41) on the line between Green Bay and Ashwaubenon, next to the Resch Center; WLUK's transmitter is located on Scray Hill in Ledgeview. On cable, WLUK is available on Charter Spectrum channel 12.\n\nUntil July 11, 2018, the station's signal was relayed in Upper Michigan on digital translator W40AN-D (channel 40), licensed to Escanaba, Michigan and transmitting from a tower in Wells Township.\n\nWLUK signed on the air on September 11, 1954 as WMBV-TV; it was originally licensed to Marinette, Wisconsin (the callsign stood for \"Marinette/Bay/Valley\"). The station was owned by William Walker and was largely constructed from the assets of a failed ABC affiliate in Oshkosh, WOSH-TV on channel 48. Walker sold the station to Morgan Murphy Stations in 1958. By 1959, the station changed its city of license to Green Bay and on August 22 changed its call sign to the current WLUK-TV (in reference to its then on-air slogan \"Lucky 11\") when it began broadcasting at full power from a new tower near Green Bay. Just before the changeover, the station also switched affiliations with WFRV-TV (channel 5), becoming an ABC affiliate. WLUK first broadcast network programs in color in 1959 and local programs began to be broadcast in color starting in 1965. Morgan Murphy then sold WLUK to Post Corporation (a small media chain not affiliated with The Washington Post Company or its Post-Newsweek Stations division), whose properties included the \"Post-Crescent\" newspaper in nearby Appleton and a sister station in Marquette, Michigan, WLUC-TV. in 1965. In 1966, WLUK built a new studio and office building on Highland Avenue, which would eventually become Lombardi Avenue in 1968 after Vince Lombardi resigned his head coaching duties with the Green Bay Packers. It aired some local entertainment programs, including a Saturday night polka show and a daily children's cartoon show using the franchised Bozo the Clown character.\n\nIn 1983, WLUK reclaimed the market's NBC affiliation, when WFRV switched to ABC. In 1984, Racine native George N. Gillett's Gillett Broadcasting purchased Post Corporation. Gillett in turn sold the station to Burnham Broadcasting later that year, in order to purchase the KKR stations (which included future fellow Fox station WITI in Milwaukee; WLUK was indeed sold due to adjacent market ownership regulations at the time by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)). For most of its second stint with NBC, WLUK largely downplayed its affiliation, even during the network's powerhouse days of the 1980s; it used the NBC Peacock only sparingly in the station's advertisements.\n\nOn July 29, 1994, Burnham Broadcasting sold WLUK-TV to SF Broadcasting – a joint venture of Savoy Communications and the Fox Broadcasting Company, then a division of News Corporation – for $38 million; the company later sold three of its other four stations (KHON-TV in Honolulu, WVUE in New Orleans and WALA-TV in Mobile, Alabama) for $229 million on August 25 (a fifth Burnham station, KBAK-TV in Bakersfield, California, was excluded from the deal and was instead spun off to Westwind Communications, a new company that was formed by several former Burnham executives). As a result of the deal, SF Broadcasting announced that the four stations would become Fox affiliates; both Savoy and Fox shared ownership with Fox originally choosing to hold voting stock, ultimately opting not to retain it prior to the closure of the sale of the stations. The purchase was challenged by NBC, which filed a petition with the FCC on September 23, 1994, alleging that News Corporation had improperly set up a shell corporation to circumvent FCC limits on the amount of monetary capital that a foreign company is allowed to invest in an American television station in order to gain control of WLUK. NBC later withdrew its petition against the acquisition on February 17, 1995. The FCC approved the WLUK purchase on April 27, 1995.\nWLUK became a Fox affiliate on August 28, 1995, swapping affiliations with WGBA-TV (channel 26), which had acquired the Fox affiliation three years earlier after WXGZ-TV (channel 32, now WACY-TV) shut down due to financial issues. Like most former \"Big Three\" network affiliates that switched to Fox during that time, WLUK picked up almost no syndicated programming from WGBA, though it was unnecessary because of WGBA's local marketing agreement with WACY-TV (channel 32); WGBA's programming largely moved to that station instead.\n\nBecause of Fox's 1994 acquisition of television rights to the NFL's National Football Conference, the switch made WLUK the unofficial \"home\" station of the Green Bay Packers after years on WBAY (and two years on WFRV), which became a major ratings draw (during the 1994 season, WGBA was the station of record for the Packers). Unlike the New World Communications stations that converted to Fox affiliates, WLUK carried Fox Kids programming, running it one hour earlier on weekday afternoons from 1:00 to 4:00 p.m. The station ran Fox Kids until the weekday block ended in December 2001 (when it had been pushed back to as early as 10:00 a.m.), and its successor Saturday morning children's blocks known as Fox Box and later 4KidsTV until the latter block ended nationally in December 2008, when 4Kids Entertainment and Fox parted ways due to a contract dispute. By the time 4Kids TV ended its run, Fox permanently discontinued providing network-supplied children's programming, replacing it with the infomercial block \"Weekend Marketplace\".\n\nSince channel 11 joined Fox, Packer football games have routinely drawn an 80% share of the viewing audience – far and away the highest-rated programs in the market, and through Fox's NFL rights deal, the station has broadcast two of the three Super Bowl games the Packers have appeared in, both victories, since 1994; Super Bowls XXXI and XLV, both by far the highest-rated programs in the Green Bay market's history.\n\nOn November 28, 1995, Silver King Communications (operated by former Fox executive Barry Diller) announced that it would acquire Savoy Pictures; at the time of the purchase, Silver King's existing stations had mainly been affiliates of the Home Shopping Network (both Silver King and HSN were later acquired by USA Networks). The sale of WVUE and the other SF stations was approved and finalized in March 1996, with its other assets being merged into the company that November. On April 1, 1997, Silver King subsequently sold the station, along with sisters WVUE, KHON and WALA to Indianapolis-based Emmis Communications for $307 million in cash and stock, as part of a sale of Silver King/USA's major network affiliates in order to concentrate on its formerly HSN-affiliated independent stations.\n\nOn May 15, 2005, Emmis Communications announced that it would sell its 16 television stations, including WLUK-TV, in order to concentrate on its radio station properties. On August 22, LIN TV Corporation purchased WLUK in a $260 million deal that included WALA-TV and sister station WBPG in Mobile; WTHI-TV in Terre Haute, Indiana and KRQE-TV in Albuquerque, New Mexico; the sale closed on December 1, 2005.\n\nOn June 4, 2010, LIN TV entered into shared services and local sales agreements to operate CW affiliate WIWB (channel 14, now WCWF) as part of a deal involving LIN and ACME Communications-owned stations in markets where both companies owned stations. WLUK began to provide technical, engineering, promotional, administrative and other operational support services for WIWB, with advertising sales services under a related but separate joint sales agreement. That station moved its operations into WLUK's studios that August. LIN would purchase WCWF outright in April 2011, under a failing station waiver (an indication that the station was in an economically non-viable position, which permitted a duopoly even though Green Bay has only seven full-power stations, one fewer than that required by FCC rules to legally permit a duopoly between WLUK and WCWF if both were economically viable), creating the Green Bay market's first legal television station duopoly.\n\nOn March 21, 2014, LIN Media entered into an agreement to merge with Media General in a $1.6 billion deal. Because, at the time, Media General owned ABC affiliate WBAY-TV (which Media General acquired in 2013 as part of its merger with Young Broadcasting), and since WBAY and WLUK rank among the four highest-rated stations in the Green Bay market in total day viewership, the companies were required to sell either WBAY or the WLUK/WCWF duopoly to another station owner in order to comply with FCC ownership rules as well as planned changes to those rules regarding same-market television stations which would prohibit sharing agreements. To settle the situation, Media General announced on August 20, 2014 that it would keep WBAY, choosing to sell WLUK and WCWF to the Sinclair Broadcast Group as part of a multi-market deal (Sinclair would also acquire WJAR in Providence and WTGS in Savannah, while Media General would acquire Sinclair's WTTA in Tampa and KXRM-TV/KXTU-LD in Colorado Springs).\n\nSinclair's acquisitions of WLUK and WCWF were completed on December 19, 2014, and expanded the company's presence in Wisconsin, as it already owned Fox affiliate WMSN-TV in Madison and the Milwaukee duopoly of CW affiliate WVTV and MyNetworkTV affiliate WVTV-DT2 (formerly WCGV-TV). The deal also placed WLUK back under common ownership with Marquette NBC affiliate WLUC-TV, which Sinclair acquired in 2013 (both WLUK and WLUC shared common ownership from 1963 to 1987 under Post and Gillett), though this reunion was a brief one, as on October 1, 2015, Sinclair struck a deal to sell WLUC to Gray Television in exchange for CBS affiliate WSBT in South Bend, Indiana as part of station divestitures that Gray instituted in order to receive regulatory approval of its acquisition of the television stations operated by the latter station's longtime owner, Schurz Communications. That deal closed on February 16, 2016, separating the two stations once again. WLUC then became a sister station to another Green Bay station, WBAY-TV in January 2017 as the result of another divestiture required by the FCC in the Nexstar/Media General merger which required the selling of WBAY-TV to Gray.\n\nOn July 6, 2016, Sinclair and WLUK announced they had placed the winning bid with ESPN for the local syndication of that cable network's \"Monday Night Football\" games with the Packers for multiple years; the agreement would have also included the 2016 preseason Pro Football Hall of Fame Game on August 7, a day after Brett Favre's induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame (this was due to regular rights carrier NBC passing the game to ESPN due to the 2016 Summer Olympics; the game was canceled an hour before kickoff due to poor field conditions). With Fox's acquisition of \"Thursday Night Football\" rights through the 2022 season, this assures that WLUK will carry a minimum of ten Packers games per season, barring any NBC or CBS cross-flexing.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nAs part of a group affiliation deal between Sinclair Broadcast Group and Tribune Media, WLUK launched Antenna TV, a digital subchannel on virtual channel 11.2, on January 1, 2016 as an affiliate with the Tribune-owned classic television network. On February 13, 2017, WLUK-TV added TBD-TV, a new channel mainly featuring web videos targeting millennials to 11.3. WLUK's news and local content (outside sportscasts) is also available through Stirr, Sinclair's over-the-top streaming service.\n\nWLUK-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 11, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 51 to VHF channel 11. On August 17, 2011, the station increased its transmitter power from 17.19 kW to 40 kW. Prior to this, Madison Fox affiliate WMSN-TV (a fellow Sinclair station pre-dating their ownership of WLUK) had broadcast its digital signal on channel 11, WLUK had to decrease its transmitter power to prevent interference with that station; when WMSN moved their digital channel to the UHF band to address reception issues in the Madison area, WLUK applied to the FCC to increase power once again.\n\nIn addition to the Fox network schedule, syndicated programs featured on WLUK include \"Wheel of Fortune\", \"Jeopardy!\", \"Judge Judy\", \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\", and \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\". WLUK is one of eight Fox affiliates to air \"Jeopardy!\" and \"Wheel\"; the others being located in Baltimore; Syracuse, New York; New Orleans; Cincinnati; Denver; Lake Charles, Louisiana and Mobile, Alabama.\n\nA longtime staple on WLUK's daily schedule was reruns of the NBC drama \"Little House on the Prairie\"; the station was one of the few in the nation to count \"Little House\" towards its fulfillment of educational and informational content obligations for young audiences, citing in part the series' inspiration from the \"Little House\" children's book series authored by state native Laura Ingalls Wilder. \"Little House\" was dropped from WLUK's daily schedule in September 2013, in part to make room for new acquisition \"Live!\". For that year, it purchased syndicated E/I programming on a barter basis for weekend airings to fulfill E/I requirements, which was reduced to an hour in mid-September 2014 as WLUK took the Fox-offered E/I block \"Xploration Station\", which features two hours of compliant programming (as such, it was the first Fox affiliate owned-and/or-operated by Sinclair that carried the block, as the group's other Fox stations at the time carred E/I programs through existing contracts with syndicators of educational program content instead; the remainder of Sinclair's Fox-affiliated stations began carrying the \"Xploration Station\" block in September 2016).\n\nSince becoming a Fox affiliate in 1995, WLUK has featured an extensive amount of local news coverage (see below). Local non-news programming includes \"Living with Amy\", which debuted in September 2008 and currently airs in the 10:00 a.m. weekday time slot; hosted by former \"Good Day Wisconsin\" anchor Amy Hanten, \"Living\" features lifestyle, cooking, and paid business spotlight segments, with the cooking segments mainly sponsored by Kroger's Pick 'n Save and Copps stores (previously sponsored by Festival Foods), which has made a recipe compilation book featuring previous \"Living with Amy\" recipes available in-store.\n\nDuring the Green Bay Packers season, WLUK airs an assortment of Packers-related programming, including \"Inside the Huddle\", which offers previews, reviews, and analysis of Packer games on Sunday mornings and Monday evenings, as well as extended newscasts with training camp coverage. Also airing during the Packers season is \"The Better Half\"; hosted by Rachel Manek and airing Friday mornings at 10:00 a.m., the show features interviews, discussions, and advice from wives and girlfriends of Packers players and coaches. \"Wheel of Fortune\" is moved back an hour on nights when WLUK carries \"Thursday Night Football\" from Fox or a \"Monday Night Football\" game to lower schedule disruption.\n\nWLUK-TV presently broadcasts 43 hours of local newscasts each week (with seven hours each weekday and four hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output among the Green Bay market's broadcast television stations and the second-highest among Wisconsin's television stations (behind fellow Fox affiliate WITI in Milwaukee, which carries 56 hours each week).\n\nIn addition to its main facilities, the station operates a Valley Newsroom on West College Avenue in Appleton along US 41. The station has its own weather radar, known as \"Fox 11 StormTrackerX\", at its main studios on Lombardi Avenue. The station also maintains a tower camera on its Doppler tower known as the \"Lambeau Cam\" which is mainly pointed in the direction of Lambeau Field.\n\nThe station dropped its nightly newscast in 1967 and did not resume regular local news broadcasts until 1971. However, WLUK did occasionally run documentaries and sports programs to fulfill FCC public service regulations as well as a weekly commentary by \"Appleton Post-Crescent\" editor John Torinus. After gaining the Fox affiliation in August 1995, this station expanded its local news offerings: in its first year with the network, local news ran on weekdays from 6:00 to 8:00 a.m. (the morning newscast being extended by one hour and syndicated programming filling the 8:00 a.m. hour to fill timeslots vacated by the departure of \"Today\"), 5:00 to 6:30 p.m. (with a half-hour added at 5:30 p.m. to fill the timeslot vacated by the departure of \"NBC Nightly News\"), and 9:00 to 10:30 p.m. The 10:00 p.m. newscast was eventually dropped by the early 2000s and replaced with syndicated programming, with the 6 p.m. show ended in 2005 when the station acquired the Sony game show rights, while the morning newscast expanded over time to four hours; additional morning newscasts on Saturdays and Sundays were added later in the 2000s. WLUK returned to airing a 10 p.m. newscast on September 21, 2015.\n\nIn 2007 (during Fox's coverage of the Major League Baseball League Championship Series), WLUK's 9:00 p.m. newscast began to air over a leased access channel on Time Warner Cable on nights in which Fox broadcasts sports programming or movies during the prime time hours that run into the 9:00 p.m. timeslot on channel 11; WCWF took over carriage of the preempted/delayed 9 p.m. newscasts in October 2010, as a result of the SSA between WCWF and WLUK. On June 5, 2007, WLUK replaced WGBA-TV as the provider of weather updates for the 11-station Midwest Communications radio cluster in Green Bay/Fox Cities and Sheboygan. In 2009, a new addition to the Lombardi Avenue studios was completed to expand the station's newsroom space, and is known as the \"Fox 11 Digital Content Center\".\n\nChannel 11 was also the first local television station in the market to have full featured iOS and Android Market applications (for mobile phones and tablets). In March 2012, the station's newscasts were moved into the Content Center as the station prepared its studio and facilities for high definition broadcasting, and began construction of an HD-optimized news set. Beginning with the 5:00 p.m. newscast on April 23, 2012, WLUK became the third station in the Green Bay-Appleton market to begin broadcasting its local news programming in high definition. The station uses the AFD #10 flag to present its newscasts in letterboxed widescreen for viewers watching on cable television through traditional 4:3 sets.\n\n\nIn the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, WLUK is only available over-the-air in Menominee County. A low powered digital translator in Escanaba operated until July 11, 2018. Despite this, WLUK was formerly carried by Charter Communications in the West and Central Upper Peninsula, along with WLUC-DT2 except in Gogebic County which is covered by the signal of Duluth, Minnesota's Fox affiliate KQDS-TV and the Eastern Upper Peninsula which is covered by WWUP-DT 10.2 (a high definition digital simulcast of Cadillac, Michigan's WFQX-TV). WLUK can also be seen on Charter in Ludington, Michigan, across Lake Michigan from the Green Bay area.\n\nUntil April 2008, WLUK's high definition signal was only available over-the-air as the station had maintained edicts going back to its ownership under Emmis not to allow local cable or satellite providers to broadcast its digital signal without paid retransmission consent. LIN TV continued to apply this policy after its purchase of the Emmis stations and eventually extended it further to the remainder of its existing stations. Station officials kept their stance against local pay television providers defending the station's stance on WLUK's website and in on-air promotions. The first provider to carry WLUK-DT was Dish Network as part of a March 13, 2008 carriage agreement with LIN TV. Originally, the signal was to be added in May 2008, but Dish began offering HD feeds of the Green Bay stations early on April 16, surprised viewers with WLUK carried on channel 5163. DirecTV followed on June 8.\n\nWith retransmission agreements firmed up with the satellite providers, LIN TV began to pursue the market's major cable providers for new deals. Charter was the first to be affected with its carriage agreement with WLUK expiring on July 1. By June 11, Charter and LIN reached a new agreement under undisclosed terms and WLUK-DT began to be carried on digital channel 611 shortly thereafter; AT&T U-verse struck an agreement to carry the digital signal on June 30, 2008, while Comcast's Manitowoc system offered compensation to carry WLUK-DT on June 12 on digital channel 234. This left Time Warner Cable as the lone holdout in the area to carry the HD feed as the provider and LIN TV had not come to an agreement nationally.\n\nWith no success from either viewer pressure or contentious negotiations, the system was forced to pull WLUK from its systems on October 3, 2008. Time Warner quickly offered free antennas for customers to receive the station. WLUK encouraged viewers to switch to Dish Network and U-verse in order to continue to watch the station in some form. In the month that followed, the ratings of LIN TV stations affected by the Time Warner dispute plunged, while viewers complained about the loss of Green Bay Packers and MLB Playoff games on WLUK.\n\nBy the time of the 2008 World Series, Time Warner Cable made an odd but creative move to allow its viewers to watch the games by offering Fox Sports en Espanol on basic cable, which carried the Series in Spanish while encouraging viewers to turn down the Spanish play-by-play audio and listen to the game in English on ESPN Radio affiliate WDUZ. Eventually the two companies came to a new carriage agreement on October 29, and WLUK's analog signal was restored on the same day with WLUK-DT being added on digital channel 712 (currently 1012) shortly thereafter, giving the station's digital signal full cable and satellite carriage on par with the other \"Big Three\" network affiliates.\n\nOn March 5, 2011, WLUK was removed from Dish Network as LIN and Dish could not come to terms on a new carriage agreement, and was restored when a new agreement was reached on March 12. WCWF remained unaffected as LIN's purchase of that station had not yet been finalized and was under the terms of their pre-WLUK SSA carriage agreement negotiated with ACME Communications.\n\nOn September 4, 2012, WLUK's signal was removed by Charter Communications systems in the Upper Peninsula and Marquette, and from systems in Sheboygan County, Lomira (both with WITI in-market) and Montello (part of the Madison market served by WMSN-TV) on September 27, 2012. This was due not to either the station or LIN removing access to the station, but contractual agreements by the Fox network itself which disallow signal duplication of network programming by an out-of-market signal despite the station's longtime service to each area, a source of controversy already in other duplicative market areas in the past. WITI added the WLUK-produced \"The Better Half\" to their Friday afternoon schedule for the Milwaukee market that year, which has since moved to WTMJ. WLUK continues to present the forecasts on Midwest Communications' Sheboygan radio stations despite the loss of coverage on that city's cable provider. Despite the loss of cable carriage in the Upper Peninsula, it was still available to antenna viewers in Escanaba via W40AN-D until July 2018.\n\n"}
{"id": "2261684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2261684", "title": "One Magic Christmas", "text": "One Magic Christmas\n\nOne Magic Christmas is a 1985 American/Canadian Christmas fantasy film directed by Phillip Borsos. It was released by Walt Disney Pictures and stars Mary Steenburgen and Harry Dean Stanton. It was shot in Meaford, Ontario with some scenes in Owen Sound, Ontario, Canada.\n\nGinny Grainger (Steenburgen) is the mother of two children, Cal (Robbie Magwood) and Abbie (Elisabeth Harnois). Her husband, Jack (Gary Basaraba), has been out of work since July, and they have to move out of the company house by January 1. Jack fixes bikes as a hobby in the basement and hopes to give one to his children's poor friend, Molly Monaghan, for Christmas. Although he would like to open a bike shop of his own, doing so would use up all their savings, which Ginny sees as a foolish move. In order to make ends meet, she works as a cashier at a grocery store.\n\nOne night, Abbie goes across the street to the mailbox to send a letter to Santa Claus. After she mails it, Gideon (Harry Dean Stanton), an angel who has been watching the Graingers, retrieves it from the mailbox and returns it to her saying that her mother should mail it. She agrees, and as she's crossing the street to return home, a car barrels down the road towards her. Gideon stops the impending accident and allows Abbie to cross the street without incident.\n\nThe next day, the Graingers visit Jack's grandfather, Caleb. He gives the children presents: Cal a Christmas book and Abbie a snow globe of the North Pole. That night Gideon visits Abbie in her room only to learn that Ginny did not mail Abbie's letter to Santa Claus. Gideon warns Abbie that some things are going to happen tomorrow and not to be afraid. Meanwhile, Ginny and Jack are in the kitchen talking about their finances. He reiterates his desire to open a bike shop, but she feels that he should find a new job, as the time to start turning a profit from a business would be too long. Frustrated, he storms out of the house to go for a walk. She races after him to try to work things out. Ominously, all the Christmas lights begin turning off all around her, as to show that the last of the Christmas spirit has been drained from her.\n\nThe next day, Christmas Eve, Ginny gets a ride to work from a friend. While at a gas station, she sees a man named Harry Dickens trying to sell some of his possessions in order to support himself and his son, with little success. She shrugs off the situation and goes on with her day. Meanwhile, Jack, along with the children, goes to the bank to take some money out of their savings to do some Christmas shopping. He tells them to wait in the car, but Abbie leaves to visit Ginny at the grocery store across the street. Abbie informs Ginny that Jack is at the bank which causes her to storm out to stop him, only to have her boss, Herbie Conklin, see her leave and fire her. She returns Abbie to the car and enters the bank only to discover that Harry is holding it up. Jack attempts to quell the situation, but Harry impulsively shoots, and Jack collapses onto the ground. A sobbing Ginny cradles her dead husband on the ground. In a panic, Harry flees the bank and steals Jack's car with Cal and Abbie still inside. Ginny chases after him in his car, but it runs out of gas before she can catch up with him. He comes to a bridge where the police have set up a road block and tries to swerve around it, but skids off the bridge, plummeting to his death into the icy river below.\n\nDistraught, Ginny returns home to an empty house and weeps in the bathroom. However, Caleb soon comes to the house to inform her that the kids have been found standing on the side of the road. The police believe that Harry dropped them off before the crash, when in reality Gideon rescued them from the river. When they return home, Ginny informs them that Jack has been murdered by Harry and is never coming home.\n\nLater that night, Abbie runs away to the town's Christmas tree in hopes of finding Gideon to ask him to bring back her dad. Gideon tells her that he can't fix things like what has happened to her dad and that the only person who can bring him back is Santa Claus himself. Gideon takes Abbie to the North Pole to meet him. He informs her that he too cannot fix what has happened nor can he bring the Christmas spirit back to Ginny, but Abbie can. He then takes her through his factory (which is run by \"ordinary, nice people,\" not elves) and retrieves an old letter that Ginny had written when she was a child. He tells her that it may hold the key to helping her mother.\n\nGideon returns Abbie to her house and she gives her mother the letter. She reads it and finally realizes the true meaning of Christmas: to celebrate what you have and not what you want. She walks outside to the mailbox and mails Abbie's letter. Just then, all the Christmas lights in the neighborhood come back on, Jack reappears, and Ginny hugs him much to his confusion as he is only returning from his short walk the previous night.\n\nThe next day, Ginny relives the events of that Christmas Eve with a much different attitude. She gets her boss to concede to let her take the day off so she can spend time with family. At the gas station she buys a camp stove from Harry who thanks her and wishes her a \"Merry Christmas\". That evening, she attends the tree lighting in the village square, happily joining the participants in singing \"O Christmas Tree\". Later, she writes a check to Jack for the bike shop and the family delivers one to Molly. As she is about to fall asleep, she hears something downstairs and finds Santa putting presents under the tree. He then stops and looks at her and says, \"Merry Christmas, Ginny.\" She smiles and with tear-filled eyes, finally says the words she has been unable to speak for so long: \"Merry Christmas!\"\n\nThe film was theatrically released in Canada and the United States on November 22, 1985. It opened in Brazil on December 18, 1985, and in Australia the following year, on November 27, 1986. It was released in Uruguay on December 12, 1986, through VHS (Montevideo), and in Japan the following year, on November 25, 1987 on VHS.\n\nThe film was released in many languages with several alternate titles. \n\nIt was released on DVD in the United States (Region 1) on August 21, 2001.\n\nOn December 4, 2012, Netflix released the DVD and later made it available to stream in the United States, France, and the Netherlands.\n\n\"One Magic Christmas\" grossed $2,662,241 in its opening weekend in North America, November 22–24, 1985, and a domestic total of $13,677,222.\n\n\"One Magic Christmas\" has a 47% score on Rotten Tomatoes from critics, and 70% from general audiences. Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four, saying, \"This is very unfortunate. What we have here is a movie with an intelligent screenplay, wonderful performances and skilful direction, but it is a tactical miscalculation from beginning to end.\"\n\n"}

She was born in Pennsylvania and is one of three children. Frye was a member of the San Diego City Council, representing District 6 and a two-time candidate for mayor of San Diego. In July 2013 Frye was among the first to call on then-San Diego Democrat Mayor Bob Filner to resign over accusations of sexual harassment and assault.\n\nFrye was born in 1952 in Pennsylvania, the second of three children. Her family moved to San Diego when her father took a civilian job with the Navy.\n\nAfter a failed first marriage in late 1979, Frye had problems with alcohol abuse. That changed within months of meeting her current husband Skip Frye at a Mexican restaurant in December 1980, and Frye stopped drinking in early 1981. In 1988, they opened a custom-made surfboard shop in Pacific Beach and they married in 1990.\n\nFrye first became concerned with coastal water pollution problems when her husband repeatedly became sick after surfing. She soon became an environmental and community leader. In 2001 she was elected to the San Diego City Council in a special election. She was later elected to full term on the council in the regular 2002 city council elections.\n\nFrye ran for mayor of San Diego in the November 2004 run-off election between Dick Murphy and Ron Roberts as a write-in candidate, without having run in the primary. A plurality of voters wrote in her name, but a controversy arose when she lost the election because a number of voters did not fill in the bubble next to her written name or misspelled her name (usually spelling her last name \"Fry\"). If those votes had counted, Frye would have had more votes than either of the moderate Republican candidates officially in the runoff, but still far below a majority vote. Whether Frye would have been allowed to serve as mayor in any case is uncertain, as her write-in candidacy was at odds with the San Diego City Charter.\n\nDick Murphy was re-elected as mayor after a series of legal challenges to the election results, but resigned on July 15, 2005, as the city's fiscal crisis and legal woes with regulatory and law enforcement agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Bureau of Investigation worsened and became a matter of increasing public awareness. \n\nFrye ran for mayor in the special election that took place on July 26, 2005, with a platform advocating open and honest government and restoring order to the city's financial situation, points found in nearly all of the candidates' platforms. Frye was endorsed by Mike Aguirre, the city attorney who has confronted the city council over releasing documents.\n\nFrye placed ahead of ten opponents, including former police chief and runner-up Jerry Sanders (27%), by receiving 43% of the vote. However, a majority was needed to win outright, and so a run-off election was held between Frye and Sanders on November 8, 2005. Frye was defeated in this election, receiving 46.1% of the vote to Sanders' 53.9%. She did, however, win reelection to her council seat in the 2006 city council elections, retiring in 2010 due to term limits.\n\nIn December 2012, Frye joined the administration of San Diego Mayor Bob Filner in a new position he created called Director of Open Government. She resigned in April 2013 to become president of Californians Aware, a nonprofit that advocates for open government statewide.\n\nIn July 2013 she and two other former supporters of Filner publicly called on Filner to resign as mayor, alleging that he had sexually harassed numerous unnamed women by forcibly kissing them, fondling them and making sexually suggestive remarks. Though refusing at first to step down, Filner eventually resigned in August 2013. In October of that year, he pleaded guilty to state charges of false imprisonment and misdemeanor battery.\n\nFrye was nominated and inducted into the San Diego County's Women's Hall of Fame in 2011 for the 'Spirit 2011' title. The Hall of Fame's aim is to \"acknowledge and honor women who have significantly contributed to the quality of life and who have made outstanding volunteer contributions in San Diego County.\" The annual Women's Hall of Fame induction is co-hosted by Women's Museum of California (Located in San Diego), Commission on the Status of Women, UC San Diego Women's Center, and San Diego State Women's Studies.\n\n"}

Ballygalley Neolithic site produced a large number of finds, including pottery, worked flints and stone axes and is an important Neolithic site.\n\nNotable features include the distinct headland of Ballygally Head, O'Haloran's Castle, The White Bear Rock, a lovely sandy beach, Ballygally Castle and Ballygally Hall, which opened in 2011.\n\nBallygally beach is a popular destination for locals and tourists alike especially during the summer months.\n\nBallygally Castle, reputed to be the oldest occupied building in Ireland, has a reputation for being haunted. It sits in the middle of the village at the junction with the road to Cairncastle and contains a 4-star hotel with renovated bar and restaurant. The castle was built around 1625 for James Shaw of Greenock and is one of Ireland's best-preserved Scottish baronial style plantation houses. The bawn and walled garden are registered as Scheduled Historic Monuments at grid ref: D3725 0781.\n\nBallygally Hall is a two-storey building (funded by the Big Lottery, Larne Borough Council and NER) which opened in 2011 and includes a Spar shop with some Post Office facilities at ground level and a Community Hall on the first floor. The shop and restaurant, which previously existed on this site, were demolished in 2008, The Community Hall has weekly events and social activities throughout the year.\n\nCairndhu Golf Course, on top of Ballygally Head, overlooks the village and Carnfunnock Country Park (which offers a cafe, walled garden, caravan park and campsite, maze, children's playground, bouncy castle, mini-train rides, bungee runs, mini-golf, nature walks and lots more family fun) is nearby.\n\nIn 2014, Outdoor Recreation NI produced a report called 'Options to enhance access with the creation of a natural heritage trail between Ballygally Village and Carnfunnock Country Park' highlighting Ballygally's close links to the park.\nBallygally is classified as a small village or hamlet by the NI Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) (i.e. with a population between 500 and 1,000 people). On Census day (29 April 2001) there were 714 people living in Ballygally. Of these:\n\nFor more details see: NI Neighbourhood Information Service\n\nBallygally Head was (in 1983) the only recorded location of \"Gelidiella\" \"calcicola\" from Northern Ireland.\n\nBallygally Head is a volcanic plug, the ancient cooled remains of the pipe of a volcano.\n\nWedges of agglomerate have been found around Ballygally Head, showing that there were several stages of eruption, allowing tuff to form before the vent was blown out and once more filled with magma. There are tall columns in places around Ballygally Head, similar to the basalt columns found at the Giant's Causeway, but these are dolerite, a rock similar to basalt but which cooled more slowly, held inside the volcano vent, and so had time to grow larger crystals.\n\nScawt Hill, another volcanic plug 5 km west north west of Ballygally, is an internationally important site for geology due to the rare minerals found there. It is a protected Area of Special Scientific Interest.\n\n"}
